block: create the request_queue debugfs_dir on registration

We were only creating the request_queue debugfs_dir only
for make_request block drivers (multiqueue), but never for
request-based block drivers. We did this as we were only
creating non-blktrace additional debugfs files on that directory
for make_request drivers. However, since blktrace *always* creates
that directory anyway, we special-case the use of that directory
on blktrace. Other than this being an eye-sore, this exposes
request-based block drivers to the same debugfs fragile
race that used to exist with make_request block drivers
where if we start adding files onto that directory we can later
run a race with a double removal of dentries on the directory
if we don't deal with this carefully on blktrace.

Instead, just simplify things by always creating the request_queue
debugfs_dir on request_queue registration. Rename the mutex also to
reflect the fact that this is used outside of the blktrace context.
