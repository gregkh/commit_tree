bpf, xdp: Remove XDP_QUERY_PROG and XDP_QUERY_PROG_HW XDP commands

Now that BPF program/link management is centralized in generic net_device
code, kernel code never queries program id from drivers, so
XDP_QUERY_PROG/XDP_QUERY_PROG_HW commands are unnecessary.

This patch removes all the implementations of those commands in kernel, along
the xdp_attachment_query().

This patch was compile-tested on allyesconfig.
