scsi: ufs: Clean up ufs initialization path

At UFS initialization stage, to get the length of the descriptor,
ufshcd_read_desc_length() was being called 6 times. Instead, we will
capture the descriptor size the first time we'll read it.

Delete unnecessary redundant code, remove ufshcd_read_desc_length(),
ufshcd_init_desc_sizes(), and boost UFS initialization.
