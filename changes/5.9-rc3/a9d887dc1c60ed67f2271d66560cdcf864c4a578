pwm: Convert period and duty cycle to u64

Because period and duty cycle are defined as ints with units of
nanoseconds, the maximum time duration that can be set is limited to
~2.147 seconds. Change their definitions to u64 in the structs of the
PWM framework so that higher durations may be set.

Also use the right format specifiers in debug prints in both core.c,
pwm-stm32-lp.c as well as video/fbdev/ssd1307fb.c.
