RISC-V: Remove CLINT related code from timer and arch

Right now the RISC-V timer driver is convoluted to support:
1. Linux RISC-V S-mode (with MMU) where it will use TIME CSR for
   clocksource and SBI timer calls for clockevent device.
2. Linux RISC-V M-mode (without MMU) where it will use CLINT MMIO
   counter register for clocksource and CLINT MMIO compare register
   for clockevent device.

We now have a separate CLINT timer driver which also provide CLINT
based IPI operations so let's remove CLINT MMIO related code from
arch/riscv directory and RISC-V timer driver.
