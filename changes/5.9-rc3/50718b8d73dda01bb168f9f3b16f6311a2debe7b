xfs: remove SYNC_TRYLOCK from inode reclaim

All background reclaim is SYNC_TRYLOCK already, and even blocking
reclaim (SYNC_WAIT) can use trylock mechanisms as
xfs_reclaim_inodes_ag() will keep cycling until there are no more
reclaimable inodes. Hence we can kill SYNC_TRYLOCK from inode
reclaim and make everything unconditionally non-blocking.

We remove all the optimistic "avoid blocking on locks" checks done
in xfs_reclaim_inode_grab() as nothing blocks on locks anymore.
Further, checking XFS_IFLOCK optimistically can result in detecting
inodes in the process of being cleaned (i.e. between being removed
from the AIL and having the flush lock dropped), so for
xfs_reclaim_inodes() to reliably reclaim all inodes we need to drop
these checks anyway.
