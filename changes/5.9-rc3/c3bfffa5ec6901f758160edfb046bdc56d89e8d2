scsi: zfcp: Avoid benign overflow of the Request Queue's free-level

zfcp_qdio_send() and zfcp_qdio_int_req() run concurrently, adding and
completing SBALs on the Request Queue. There's a theoretical race where
zfcp_qdio_int_req() completes a number of SBALs & increments the queue's
free-level _before_ zfcp_qdio_send() was able to decrement it.

This can cause ->req_q_free to momentarily hold a value larger than
QDIO_MAX_BUFFERS_PER_Q. Luckily zfcp_qdio_send() is always called under
->req_q_lock, and all readers of the free-level also take this lock. So we
can trust that zfcp_qdio_send() will clean up such a temporary overflow
before anyone can actually observe it.

But it's still confusing and annoying to worry about. So adjust the code to
avoid this race.
