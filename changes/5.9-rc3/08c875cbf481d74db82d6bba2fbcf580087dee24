block: Use non _rcu version of list functions for tag_set_list

tag_set_list is only accessed under the tag_set_lock lock. There is
no need for using the _rcu list functions.

The _rcu list function were introduced to allow read access to the
tag_set_list protected under RCU, see 705cda97ee3a ("blk-mq: Make it
safe to use RCU to iterate over blk_mq_tag_set.tag_list") and
05b79413946d ("Revert "blk-mq: don't handle TAG_SHARED in restart"").
Those changes got reverted later but the cleanup commit missed a
couple of places to undo the changes.

Fixes: 97889f9ac24f ("blk-mq: remove synchronize_rcu() from blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set()"
