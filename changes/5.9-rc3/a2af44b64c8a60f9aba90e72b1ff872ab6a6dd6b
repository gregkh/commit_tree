mlxsw: spectrum_dcb: Rename mlxsw_sp_port_headroom_set()

mlxsw_sp_port_headroom_set() is defined twice - in spectrum.c and in
spectrum_dcb.c, with different arguments and different implementation
but the name is same.

Rename mlxsw_sp_port_headroom_set() to mlxsw_sp_port_headroom_ets_set()
in order to allow using the second function in several files, and not
only as static function in spectrum.c.
