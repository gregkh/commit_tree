selftests/bpf: Test access to bpf map pointer

Add selftests to test access to map pointers from bpf program for all
map types except struct_ops (that one would need additional work).

verifier test focuses mostly on scenarios that must be rejected.

prog_tests test focuses on accessing multiple fields both scalar and a
nested struct from bpf program and verifies that those fields have
expected values.
