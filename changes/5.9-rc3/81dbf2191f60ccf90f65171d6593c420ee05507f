net: fddi: skfp: cfm: Remove seemingly unused variable 'ID_sccs'

This variable is present in many source files and has not been used
anywhere (at least internally) since it was introduced.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/net/fddi/skfp/cfm.c: In function ‘cfm’:
 drivers/net/fddi/skfp/cfm.c:211:6: warning: variable ‘oldstate’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 drivers/net/fddi/skfp/cfm.c:40:19: warning: ‘ID_sccs’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
