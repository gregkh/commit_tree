ALSA: usb-audio: ignore broken processing/extension unit

Some devices have broken extension unit where getting current value
doesn't work. Attempt that once when creating mixer control for it. If
it fails, just ignore it, so that it won't cripple the device entirely
(and/or make the error floods).
