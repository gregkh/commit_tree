exec: Remove do_execve_file

Now that the last callser has been removed remove this code from exec.

For anyone thinking of resurrecing do_execve_file please note that
the code was buggy in several fundamental ways.

- It did not ensure the file it was passed was read-only and that
  deny_write_access had been called on it.  Which subtlely breaks
  invaniants in exec.

- The caller of do_execve_file was expected to hold and put a
  reference to the file, but an extra reference for use by exec was
  not taken so that when exec put it's reference to the file an
  underflow occured on the file reference count.

- The point of the interface was so that a pathname did not need to
  exist.  Which breaks pathname based LSMs.

Tetsuo Handa originally reported these issues[1].  While it was clear
that deny_write_access was missing the fundamental incompatibility
with the passed in O_RDWR filehandle was not immediately recognized.

All of these issues were fixed by modifying the usermode driver code
to have a path, so it did not need this hack.
