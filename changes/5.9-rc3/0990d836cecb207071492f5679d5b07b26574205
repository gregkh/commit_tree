s390/debug: debug feature version 3

Change __debug_entry structure in the following way:
 - remove redundant union
 - Field containing cpuid is expanded to 16 bits. 8-bit width was not
   enough since we already support up to 512 cpus.
 - Field containing the timestamp is expanded to 60 bits. The timestamp
   itself is now stored in the absolute Unix time format in microseconds
   taking the Epoch Index into acount.
Adjust default header for debug entries by setting minimum width for cpuid
to 4 digits.
