vxge: use generic power management

With legacy PM, drivers themselves were responsible for managing the
device's power states and takes care of register states.

After upgrading to the generic structure, PCI core will take care of
required tasks and drivers should do only device-specific operations.

Use "struct dev_pm_ops" variable to bind the callbacks.

Compile-tested only.
