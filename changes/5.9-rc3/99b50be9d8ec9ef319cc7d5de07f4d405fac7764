PCI: Treat "external-facing" devices themselves as internal

"External-facing" devices are internal devices that expose PCIe hierarchies
such as Thunderbolt outside the platform [1].  Previously these internal
devices were marked as "untrusted" the same as devices downstream from
them.

Use the ACPI or DT information to identify external-facing devices, but
only mark the devices *downstream* from them as "untrusted" [2].  The
external-facing device itself is no longer marked as untrusted.
