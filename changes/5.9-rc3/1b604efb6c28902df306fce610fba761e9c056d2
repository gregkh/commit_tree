mlxsw: Set port split ability attribute in driver

Currently, port attributes like flavour, port number and whether the port
was split are set when initializing a port.

Set the split ability of the port as well, based on port_mapping->width
field and split attribute of devlink port in spectrum, so that it could be
easily passed to devlink in the next patch.
