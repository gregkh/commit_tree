drm/i915: Introduce proper dbuf state

Add a global state to track the dbuf slices. Gets rid of all the nasty
coupling between state->modeset and dbuf recomputation. Also we can now
totally nuke state->active_pipe_changes.

dev_priv->wm.distrust_bios_wm still remains, but that too will get
nuked soon.
