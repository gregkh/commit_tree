drm/mgag200: Split MISC register update into PLL selection, SYNC and I/O

Set different fields in MISC in their rsp location in the code. This
patch also fixes a bug in the original code where the mode's SYNC flags
were never written into the MISC register.

v2:
	* use u8 instead of uint8_t
	* define MGAREG_MISC_CLK_SEL_MASK
