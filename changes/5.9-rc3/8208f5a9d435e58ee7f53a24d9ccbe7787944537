Bluetooth: Update background scan and report device based on advertisement monitors

This calls hci_update_background_scan() when there is any update on the
advertisement monitors. If there is at least one advertisement monitor,
the filtering policy of scan parameters should be 0x00. This also reports
device found mgmt events if there is at least one monitor.

The following cases were tested with btmgmt advmon-* commands.
(1) add a ADV monitor and observe that the passive scanning is
triggered.
(2) remove the last ADV monitor and observe that the passive scanning is
terminated.
(3) with a LE peripheral paired, repeat (1) and observe the passive
scanning continues.
(4) with a LE peripheral paired, repeat (2) and observe the passive
scanning continues.
(5) with a ADV monitor, suspend/resume the host and observe the passive
scanning continues.
