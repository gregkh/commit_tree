leds: lm3533: fix use-after-free on unbind

Several MFD child drivers register their class devices directly under
the parent device. This means you cannot blindly do devres conversions
so that deregistration ends up being tied to the parent device,
something which leads to use-after-free on driver unbind when the class
device is released while still being registered.
