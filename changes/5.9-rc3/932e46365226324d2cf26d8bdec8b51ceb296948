seqlock: Implement raw_seqcount_begin() in terms of raw_read_seqcount()

raw_seqcount_begin() has the same code as raw_read_seqcount(), with the
exception of masking the sequence counter's LSB before returning it to
the caller.

Note, raw_seqcount_begin() masks the counter's LSB before returning it
to the caller so that read_seqcount_retry() can fail if the counter is
odd -- without the overhead of an extra branching instruction.
