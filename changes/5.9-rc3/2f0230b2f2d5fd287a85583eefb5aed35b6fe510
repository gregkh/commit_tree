s390/pci: re-introduce zpci_remove_device()

For fixing the PF to VF link removal we need to perform some action on
every removal of a zdev from the common PCI subsystem.
So in preparation re-introduce zpci_remove_device() and use that instead
of directly calling the common code functions. This  was actually still
declared from earlier code but no longer implemented.
