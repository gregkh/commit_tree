bpf: Avoid visit same object multiple times

Currently when traversing all tasks, the next tid
is always increased by one. This may result in
visiting the same task multiple times in a
pid namespace.

This patch fixed the issue by seting the next
tid as pid_nr_ns(pid, ns) + 1, similar to
funciton next_tgid().
