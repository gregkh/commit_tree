KVM: X86: Move ignore_msrs handling upper the stack

MSR accesses can be one of:

  (1) KVM internal access,
  (2) userspace access (e.g., via KVM_SET_MSRS ioctl),
  (3) guest access.

The ignore_msrs was previously handled by kvm_get_msr_common() and
kvm_set_msr_common(), which is the bottom of the msr access stack.  It's
working in most cases, however it could dump unwanted warning messages to dmesg
even if kvm get/set the msrs internally when calling __kvm_set_msr() or
__kvm_get_msr() (e.g. kvm_cpuid()).  Ideally we only want to trap cases (2)
or (3), but not (1) above.

To achieve this, move the ignore_msrs handling upper until the callers of
__kvm_get_msr() and __kvm_set_msr().  To identify the "msr missing" event, a
new return value (KVM_MSR_RET_INVALID==2) is used for that.
