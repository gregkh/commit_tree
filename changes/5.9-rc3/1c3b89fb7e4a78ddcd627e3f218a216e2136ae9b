ASoC: tegra: Add support for CIF programming

Audio Client Interface (CIF) is a proprietary interface employed to route
audio samples through Audio Hub (AHUB) components by inter connecting the
various modules.

This patch exports an inline function tegra_set_cif() which can be used,
for now, to program CIF on Tegra210 and later Tegra generations. Later it
can be extended to include helpers for legacy chips as well.
