powerpc/kexec_file: Prepare elfcore header for crashing kernel

Prepare elf headers for the crashing kernel's core file using
crash_prepare_elf64_headers() and pass on this info to kdump kernel by
updating its command line with elfcorehdr parameter. Also, add
elfcorehdr location to reserve map to avoid it from being stomped on
while booting.
