arm64/mm: Redefine CONT_{PTE, PMD}_SHIFT

Currently, the value of CONT_{PTE, PMD}_SHIFT is off from standard
{PAGE, PMD}_SHIFT. In turn, we have to consider adding {PAGE, PMD}_SHIFT
when using CONT_{PTE, PMD}_SHIFT in the function hugetlbpage_init().
It's a bit confusing.

This redefines CONT_{PTE, PMD}_SHIFT with {PAGE, PMD}_SHIFT included
so that the later values needn't be added when using the former ones
in function hugetlbpage_init(). Note that the values of CONT_{PTES, PMDS}
are unchanged.
