csky: remove unusued thread_saved_pc and *_segments functions/macros

These are used nowhere in the tree (except for some architectures which
define them for their own use) and were already removed for other
architectures in:

commit 6474924e2b5d ("arch: remove unused macro/function thread_saved_pc()")
commit c17c02040bf0 ("arch: remove unused *_segments() macros/functions")

Remove them from arch/csky as well.
