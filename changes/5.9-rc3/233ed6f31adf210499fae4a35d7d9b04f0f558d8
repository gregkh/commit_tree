MIPS: Ingenic: Fix bugs and add missing LED node for X1000.

1.The CU1000-Neo board actually uses X1000E instead of X1000,
  so the wrongly written "ingenic,x1000" in compatible should
  be changed to "ingenic,x1000e".
2.Adjust the order of nodes according to the corresponding
  address value.
3.Drop unnecessary node in "wlan_pwrseq".
4.Add the leds node to "cu1000-neo.dts".
