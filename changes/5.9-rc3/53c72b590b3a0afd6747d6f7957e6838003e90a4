rcu/tree: cache specified number of objects

In order to reduce the dynamic need for pages in kfree_rcu(),
pre-allocate a configurable number of pages per CPU and link
them in a list. When kfree_rcu() reclaims objects, the object's
container page is cached into a list instead of being released
to the low-level page allocator.

Such an approach provides O(1) access to free pages while also
reducing the number of requests to the page allocator. It also
makes the kfree_rcu() code to have free pages available during
a low memory condition.

A read-only sysfs parameter (rcu_min_cached_objs) reflects the
minimum number of allowed cached pages per CPU.
