mptcp: mark as fallback even early ones

In the unlikely event of a failure at connect time,
we currently clear the request_mptcp flag - so that
the MPC handshake is not started at all, but the msk
is not explicitly marked as fallback.

This would lead to later insertion of wrong DSS options
in the xmitted packets, in violation of RFC specs and
possibly fooling the peer.
