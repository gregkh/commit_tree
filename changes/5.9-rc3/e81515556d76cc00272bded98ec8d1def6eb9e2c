mmc: sdio: fix clock rate setting for SDR12/SDR25 mode

In current code logic, when work in SDR12/SDR25 mode, the final clock
rate is incorrect, just the legancy 400KHz, because the
card->sw_caps.sd3_bus_mode do not has the flag SD_MODE_UHS_SDR12 or
SD_MODE_UHS_SDR25. Besides, SDIO_SPEED_SDR12 is actually value 0, and
every mode need to config the timing and clock rate, so remove the
‘if’ operator.
