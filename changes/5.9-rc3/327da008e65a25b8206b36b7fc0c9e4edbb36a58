powerpc: Add POWER10 raw mode cputable entry

Add a raw mode cputable entry for POWER10. Copies most of the fields
from commit a3ea40d5c736 ("powerpc: Add POWER10 architected mode")
except for oprofile_cpu_type, machine_check_early, pvr_mask and
pvr_mask fields. On bare metal systems we use DT CPU features, which
doesn't need a cputable entry. But in VMs we still rely on the raw
cputable entry to set the correct values for the PMU related fields.
