ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: Remove fsl_asoc_card_set_bias_level function

With this case:
aplay -Dhw:x 16khz.wav 24khz.wav
There is sound distortion for 24khz.wav. The reason is that setting
PLL of WM8962 with set_bias_level function, the bias level is not
changed when 24khz.wav is played, then the PLL won't be reset, the
clock is not correct, so distortion happens.

The resolution of this issue is to remove fsl_asoc_card_set_bias_level.
Move PLL configuration to hw_params and hw_free.

After removing fsl_asoc_card_set_bias_level, also test WM8960 case,
it can work.
