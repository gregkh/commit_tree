KVM: arm64: Allow ARM64_PTR_AUTH when ARM64_VHE=n

We currently prevent PtrAuth from even being built if KVM is selected,
but VHE isn't. It is a bit of a pointless restriction, since we also
check this at run time (rejecting the enabling of PtrAuth for the
vcpu if we're not running with VHE).

Just drop this apparently useless restriction.
