dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Query throughput level information from hardware

The CAP3 register contains information about the number of
HCHAN (High Capacity) and UCHAN (Ultra High Capacity) channels in UDMAP.

Based on this information the start indexes of the levels can be calculated
without a need of a table in the match data.

On am654 the CAP3 does not contain information about the number different
channels. Set up the tpl information based on the available documentation.

This change will allow to use the same compatible for different SoCs where
the only difference is the number of channel types.
