s390/qeth: tolerate pre-filled RX buffer

When preparing a buffer for RX refill, tolerate that it already has a
pool_entry attached. Otherwise we could easily leak such a pool_entry
when re-driving the RX refill after an error (from eg. do_qdio()).

This needs some minor adjustment in the code that drains RX buffer(s)
prior to RX refill and during teardown, so that ->pool_entry is NULLed
accordingly.
