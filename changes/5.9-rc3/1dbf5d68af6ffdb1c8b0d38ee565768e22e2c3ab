KVM: VMX: Add guest physical address check in EPT violation and misconfig

Check guest physical address against its maximum, which depends on the
guest MAXPHYADDR. If the guest's physical address exceeds the
maximum (i.e. has reserved bits set), inject a guest page fault with
PFERR_RSVD_MASK set.

This has to be done both in the EPT violation and page fault paths, as
there are complications in both cases with respect to the computation
of the correct error code.

For EPT violations, unfortunately the only possibility is to emulate,
because the access type in the exit qualification might refer to an
access to a paging structure, rather than to the access performed by
the program.

Trapping page faults instead is needed in order to correct the error code,
but the access type can be obtained from the original error code and
passed to gva_to_gpa.  The corrections required in the error code are
subtle. For example, imagine that a PTE for a supervisor page has a reserved
bit set.  On a supervisor-mode access, the EPT violation path would trigger.
However, on a user-mode access, the processor will not notice the reserved
bit and not include PFERR_RSVD_MASK in the error code.
