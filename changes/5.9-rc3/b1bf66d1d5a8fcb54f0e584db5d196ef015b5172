scsi: ufs: Fix imprecise load calculation in devfreq window

The UFS load calculation is based on "total_time" and "busy_time" in a
devfreq window.  However, the source of time is different for both
parameters: "busy_time" is assigned from "jiffies" thus has different
accuracy from "total_time" which is assigned from ktime_get().

In addition, the time of window boundary is not exactly the same as the
starting busy time in this window if UFS is actually busy in the beginning
of the window. A similar accuracy error may also happen for the end of busy
time in current window.

To guarantee the precision of load calculation, we need to

1. Align time accuracy of both devfreq_dev_status.total_time and
   devfreq_dev_status.busy_time. For example, use "ktime_get()" directly.

2. Align the following timelines:
   - The beginning time of devfreq windows
   - The beginning of busy time in a new window
   - The end of busy time in the current window
