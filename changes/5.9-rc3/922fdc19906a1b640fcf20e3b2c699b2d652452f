iio: adc: max9611: Demote obvious misuse of kerneldoc to standard comment blocks

No attempt has been made to document any of the demoted structs here.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/iio/adc/max9611.c:117: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'const unsigned int max9611_mux_conf[][2] = '
 drivers/iio/adc/max9611.c:145: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'const unsigned int max9611_gain_conf[][2] = '
