dma-pool: fix coherent pool allocations for IOMMU mappings

When allocating coherent pool memory for an IOMMU mapping we don't care
about the DMA mask.  Move the guess for the initial GFP mask into the
dma_direct_alloc_pages and pass dma_coherent_ok as a function pointer
argument so that it doesn't get applied to the IOMMU case.
