io_uring: remove setting REQ_F_MUST_PUNT in rw

io_{read,write}() {
	...
copy_iov: // prep async
  	if (!(flags & REQ_F_NOWAIT) && !file_can_poll(file))
		flags |= REQ_F_MUST_PUNT;
}

REQ_F_MUST_PUNT there is pointless, because if it happens then
REQ_F_NOWAIT is known to be _not_ set, and the request will go
async path in __io_queue_sqe() anyway. file_can_poll() check
is also repeated in arm_poll*(), so don't need it.

Remove the mentioned assignment REQ_F_MUST_PUNT in preparation
for killing the flag.
