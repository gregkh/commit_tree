powercap: Add Power Limit4 support

Modern Intel Mobile platforms support power limit4 (PL4), which is
the SoC package level maximum power limit (in Watts). It can be used
to preemptively limits potential SoC power to prevent power spikes
from tripping the power adapter and battery over-current protection.
This patch enables this feature by exposing package level peak power
capping control to userspace via RAPL sysfs interface. With this,
application like DTPF can modify PL4 power limit, the similar way
of other package power limit (PL1).
As this feature is not tested on previous generations, here it is
enabled only for the platform that has been verified to work,
for safety concerns.
