fork: remove do_fork()

Now that all architectures have been switched to use _do_fork() and the new
struct kernel_clone_args calling convention we can remove the legacy
do_fork() helper completely. The calling convention used to be brittle and
do_fork() didn't buy us anything. The only calling convention accepted
should be based on struct kernel_clone_args going forward. It's cleaner and
uniform.
