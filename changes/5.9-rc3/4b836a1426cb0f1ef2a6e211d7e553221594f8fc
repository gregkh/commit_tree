binder: Prevent context manager from incrementing ref 0

Binder is designed such that a binder_proc never has references to
itself. If this rule is violated, memory corruption can occur when a
process sends a transaction to itself; see e.g.
<https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=09e05aba06723a94d43d>.

There is a remaining edgecase through which such a transaction-to-self
can still occur from the context of a task with BINDER_SET_CONTEXT_MGR
access:

 - task A opens /dev/binder twice, creating binder_proc instances P1
   and P2
 - P1 becomes context manager
 - P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 0 in its
   handle table
 - P1 dies (by closing the /dev/binder fd and waiting a bit)
 - P2 becomes context manager
 - P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 1 in its
   handle table
   [this triggers a warning: "binder: 1974:1974 tried to acquire
   reference to desc 0, got 1 instead"]
 - task B opens /dev/binder once, creating binder_proc instance P3
 - P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) with (void*)1 as argument (two-way
   transaction)
 - P2 receives the handle and uses it to call P3 (two-way transaction)
 - P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) (two-way transaction)
 - P2 calls P2 (via handle 1) (two-way transaction)

And then, if P2 does *NOT* accept the incoming transaction work, but
instead closes the binder fd, we get a crash.

Solve it by preventing the context manager from using ACQUIRE on ref 0.
There shouldn't be any legitimate reason for the context manager to do
that.

Additionally, print a warning if someone manages to find another way to
trigger a transaction-to-self bug in the future.
