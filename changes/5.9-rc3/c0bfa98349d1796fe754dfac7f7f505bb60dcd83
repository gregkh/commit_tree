ASoC: tegra: Add Tegra210 based I2S driver

The Inter-IC Sound (I2S) controller implements full-duplex, bi-directional
and single direction point to point serial interface. It can interface
with I2S compatible devices. Tegra I2S controller can operate as both
master and slave.

This patch registers I2S controller with ASoC framework. The component
driver exposes DAPM widgets, routes and kcontrols for the device. The DAI
driver exposes I2S interfaces, which can be used to connect different
components in the ASoC layer. Makefile and Kconfig support is added to
allow to build the driver. The I2S devices can be enabled in the DT via
"nvidia,tegra210-i2s" compatible binding.
