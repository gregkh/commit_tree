xhci: dbc: Add a operations structure to access driver functions

Don't call dbctty driver functions directly from dbc core code.
Introduce a new dbc_driver structure that contains function pointers
for disconnect and configure operations.

The driver (ttydbc) must provide these opeations when creating a dbc.

Name the structure dbc_driver instead of dbc_ops as we plan to
add more driver configureable values here, such as vid and pid.

Decouples dbc and dbctty.
