drm/i915: Reverse preemph vs. voltage swing preference

The DP spec says:
"When the combination of the requested pre-emphasis level and
 voltage swing exceeds the capability of a DPTX, the DPTX shall
 set the pre-emphasis level according to the request and use the
 highest voltage swing it can output with the given pre-emphasis level."
and
"When a DPTX reads a request beyond the limits of this Standard,
 the DPTX shall set the pre-emphasis level according to the request
 and set the highest voltage swing level it can output with the
 given pre-emphasis level. If a DPTX is requested for 9.5dB of
 pre-emphasis level (may be supported for a DPTX) and cannot support
 that level, it shall set the pre-emphasis level to the next
 highest level, 6dB."

Ie. we should first validate the pre-emphasis, and then select
the appropriate vswing for it.
