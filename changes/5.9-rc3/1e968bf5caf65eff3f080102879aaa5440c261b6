objtool: Use sh_info to find the base for .rela sections

ELF doesn't require .rela section names to match the base section. Use
the section index in sh_info to find the section instead of looking it
up by name.

LLD, for example, generates a .rela section that doesn't match the base
section name when we merge sections in a linker script for a binary
compiled with -ffunction-sections.
