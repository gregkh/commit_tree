ASoC: Intel: broadwell: simplify card names for SOF uses

Blindly adding an sof- prefix to the card name is not user friendly
and causes UCM issues with a driver name truncated to 16 characters.

Simplify to use "sof-bdw <codec_name>" pattern for all Broadwell
machine drivers. The sof- prefix is added by the core. A generic "SOF"
driver name is used, and UCMv2 will detect the configuration for this
driver by testing the card name.

Legacy uses are unmodified.
