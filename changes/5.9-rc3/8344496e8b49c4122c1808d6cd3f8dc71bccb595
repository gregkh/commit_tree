rcu-tasks: Conditionally compile show_rcu_tasks_gp_kthreads()

The show_rcu_tasks_gp_kthreads() function is not invoked by Tiny RCU,
but is nevertheless defined in Tiny RCU builds that enable Tasks Trace
RCU.  This commit therefore conditionally compiles this function so
that it is defined only in builds that actually use it.
