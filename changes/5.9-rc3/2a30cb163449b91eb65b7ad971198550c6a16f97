staging: wfx: associate tx_queues to vifs

The device handles 4 queues (one per AC) for each virtual interface (and
maximum 4 virtual interfaces). Until now the driver unified the queue of
all interfaces and handled only 4 queues for whole device.

This architecture did not allow to balance the traffic between the vif. So,
this patch relocate the queues into the vif and change the API accordingly.
