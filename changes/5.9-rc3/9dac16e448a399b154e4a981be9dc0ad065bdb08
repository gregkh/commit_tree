usb: host: ohci: Mark cc_to_error as __maybe_unused

drivers/usb/host/ohci.h in included by a whole much of different
sourcefiles.  Not all of them make use of cc_to_error.  So mark
it as __maybe_used to convey that this behaviour is not only
acceptable it's expected.

Fixes the following kernel build warning(s):
