driver core: Add state_synced sysfs file for devices that support it

This can be used to check if a device supports sync_state() callbacks
and therefore keeps resources left on by the bootloader enabled till all
its consumers have probed.

This can also be used to check if sync_state() has been called for a
device or whether it is still trying to keep resources enabled because
they were left enabled by the bootloader and all its consumers haven't
probed yet.
