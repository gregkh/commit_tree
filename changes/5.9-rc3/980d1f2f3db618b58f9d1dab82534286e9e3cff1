dt-bindings: pci: tegra: Remove PLL power supplies

The XUSB pad controller, which provides access to various USB, PCI and
SATA pads (or PHYs), needs to bring up the PLLs associated with these
pads. In order to properly do so, it needs to control the power supplied
to these PLLs.

Remove the PLL power supplies from the PCIe controller because it does
not need direct access to them. Instead it will only use the configured
pads provided by the XUSB pad controller.
