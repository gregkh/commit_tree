arm64: dts: rockchip: rename label and nodename pinctrl subnodes that end with gpio

A test with the command below gives for example this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3326-odroid-go2.dt.yaml:
tsadc: tsadc-otp-gpio:
{'phandle': [[90]], 'rockchip,pins': [[0, 6, 0, 123]]}
is not of type 'array'

'gpio' is a sort of reserved nodename and should not be used
for pinctrl in combination with 'rockchip,pins', so change
nodes that end with 'gpio' to end with 'pin' or 'pins'.
