mm: mmap: merge vma after call_mmap() if possible

The vm_flags may be changed after call_mmap() because drivers may set some
flags for their own purpose.  As a result, we failed to merge the adjacent
vma due to the different vm_flags as userspace can't pass in the same one.
Try to merge vma after call_mmap() to fix this issue.
