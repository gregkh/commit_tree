perf probe: Fix wrong variable warning when the probe point is not found

Fix a wrong "variable not found" warning when the probe point is not
found in the debuginfo.

Since the debuginfo__find_probes() can return 0 even if it does not find
given probe point in the debuginfo, fill_empty_trace_arg() can be called
with tf.ntevs == 0 and it can emit a wrong warning.  To fix this, reject
ntevs == 0 in fill_empty_trace_arg().

E.g. without this patch;

  # perf probe -x /lib64/libc-2.30.so -a "memcpy arg1=%di"
  Failed to find the location of the '%di' variable at this address.
   Perhaps it has been optimized out.
   Use -V with the --range option to show '%di' location range.
  Added new events:
    probe_libc:memcpy    (on memcpy in /usr/lib64/libc-2.30.so with arg1=%di)
    probe_libc:memcpy    (on memcpy in /usr/lib64/libc-2.30.so with arg1=%di)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe_libc:memcpy -aR sleep 1

With this;

  # perf probe -x /lib64/libc-2.30.so -a "memcpy arg1=%di"
  Added new events:
    probe_libc:memcpy    (on memcpy in /usr/lib64/libc-2.30.so with arg1=%di)
    probe_libc:memcpy    (on memcpy in /usr/lib64/libc-2.30.so with arg1=%di)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe_libc:memcpy -aR sleep 1
