KVM: Move x86's version of struct kvm_mmu_memory_cache to common code

Move x86's 'struct kvm_mmu_memory_cache' to common code in anticipation
of moving the entire x86 implementation code to common KVM and reusing
it for arm64 and MIPS.  Add a new architecture specific asm/kvm_types.h
to control the existence and parameters of the struct.  The new header
is needed to avoid a chicken-and-egg problem with asm/kvm_host.h as all
architectures define instances of the struct in their vCPU structs.

Add an asm-generic version of kvm_types.h to avoid having empty files on
PPC and s390 in the long term, and for arm64 and mips in the short term.
