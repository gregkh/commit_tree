remoteproc: ingenic: Move clock handling to prepare/unprepare callbacks

This patch moves clock related operations to the remoteproc prepare()
and unprepare() callbacks so that the PM runtime framework doesn't
have to be involved needlessly.  This provides a simpler approach and
requires less code.
