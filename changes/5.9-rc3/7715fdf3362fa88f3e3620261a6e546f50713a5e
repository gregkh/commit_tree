drm/amd/display: VSC SDP supported for SST

[why]
If a typeC to HDMI dongle supports YCbCr420 pass through and VSC
colorimetry and pixel encoding formats in the Extended Receiver
Capability, we shall allow VSC SDP to be used.

[How]
The Extended Receiver Capability field shall check the
EXTENDED_RECEIVER_CAPABILITY_FIELD_PRESENT bit in the
TRAINING_AUX_RD_INTERVAL register.  Removed DPCD rev checking for VSC
SDP.
