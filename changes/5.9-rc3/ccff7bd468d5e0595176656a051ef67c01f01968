ASoC: amd: renoir: restore two more registers during resume

Recently we found an issue about the suspend and resume. If dmic is
recording the sound, and we run suspend and resume, after the resume,
the dmic can't work well anymore. we need to close the app and reopen
the app, then the dmic could record the sound again.

For example, we run "arecord -D hw:CARD=acp,DEV=0 -f S32_LE -c 2
-r 48000 test.wav", then suspend and resume, after the system resume
back, we speak to the dmic. then stop the arecord, use aplay to play
the test.wav, we could hear the sound recorded after resume is weird,
it is not what we speak to the dmic.

I found two registers are set in the dai_hw_params(), if the two
registers are set during the resume, this issue could be fixed.
Move the code of the dai_hw_params() into the pdm_dai_trigger(), then
these two registers will be set during resume since pdm_dai_trigger()
will be called during resume. And delete the empty function
dai_hw_params().
