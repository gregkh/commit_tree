mm/vmscan: restore active/inactive ratio for anonymous LRU

Now that workingset detection is implemented for anonymous LRU, we don't
need large inactive list to allow detecting frequently accessed pages
before they are reclaimed, anymore.  This effectively reverts the
temporary measure put in by commit "mm/vmscan: make active/inactive ratio
as 1:1 for anon lru".
