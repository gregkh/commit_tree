KVM: x86: drop KVM_PV_REASON_PAGE_READY case from kvm_handle_page_fault()

KVM guest code in Linux enables APF only when KVM_FEATURE_ASYNC_PF_INT
is supported, this means we will never see KVM_PV_REASON_PAGE_READY
when handling page fault vmexit in KVM.

While on it, make sure we only follow genuine page fault path when
APF reason is zero. If we happen to see something else this means
that the underlying hypervisor is misbehaving. Leave WARN_ON_ONCE()
to catch that.
