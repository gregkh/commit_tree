x86/cpu: Refactor sync_core() for readability

Instead of having #ifdef/#endif blocks inside sync_core() for X86_64 and
X86_32, implement the new function iret_to_self() with two versions.

In this manner, avoid having to use even more more #ifdef/#endif blocks
when adding support for SERIALIZE in sync_core().
