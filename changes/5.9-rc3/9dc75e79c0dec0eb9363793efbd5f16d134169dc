media: tpg: change char argument to const char

Change the argument of type char * to const char * for function
tpg_gen_text().

This function should take in a const char * as opposed to char * as it
does not make changes to the text. This issue was found while passing
the order of colors of tpg generated test image (which is a const char
*) to this function.
