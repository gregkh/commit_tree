drm: xlnx: zynqmp: Use switch - case for link rate downshift

Use switch - case to downshift from the current link rate. It's a small
loop now, so fine to be replaced with switch - case. With a loop, it is
confusing and hard to follow as reported below.

The patch d76271d22694: "drm: xlnx: DRM/KMS driver for Xilinx ZynqMP
DisplayPort Subsystem" from Jul 7, 2018, leads to the following
static checker warning:

	drivers/gpu/drm/xlnx/zynqmp_dp.c:594 zynqmp_dp_mode_configure()
	error: iterator underflow 'bws' (-1)-2
