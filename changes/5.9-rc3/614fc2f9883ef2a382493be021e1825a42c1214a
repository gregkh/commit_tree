scsi: aic7xxx: Remove unused variable 'ahc'

Looks as though 'ahc' hasn't been used since 2005.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c: In function ‘ahc_linux_slave_configure’:
 drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:674:20: warning: variable ‘ahc’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 674 | struct ahc_softc *ahc;
 | ^~~
