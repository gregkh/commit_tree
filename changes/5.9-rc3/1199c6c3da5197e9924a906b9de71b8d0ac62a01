umd: Rename umd_info.cmdline umd_info.driver_name

The only thing supplied in the cmdline today is the driver name so
rename the field to clarify the code.

As this value is always supplied stop trying to handle the case of
a NULL cmdline.

Additionally since we now have a name we can count on use the
driver_name any place where the code is looking for a name
of the binary.
