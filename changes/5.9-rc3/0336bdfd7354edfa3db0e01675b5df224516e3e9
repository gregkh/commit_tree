coresight: Add default sink selection to CoreSight base

Adds a method to select a suitable sink connected to a given source.

In cases where no sink is defined, the coresight_find_default_sink
routine can search from a given source, through the child connections
until a suitable sink is found.

The suitability is defined in by the sink coresight_dev_subtype on the
CoreSight device, and the distance from the source by counting
connections.

Higher value subtype is preferred - where these are equal, shorter
distance from source is used as a tie-break.

This allows for default sink to be discovered were none is specified
(e.g. perf command line)
