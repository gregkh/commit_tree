sched/deadline: Add dl_bw_capacity()

Capacity-aware SCHED_DEADLINE Admission Control (AC) needs root domain
(rd) CPU capacity sum.

Introduce dl_bw_capacity() which for a symmetric rd w/ a CPU capacity
of SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE simply relies on dl_bw_cpus() to return #CPUs
multiplied by SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE.

For an asymmetric rd or a CPU capacity < SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE it
computes the CPU capacity sum over rd span and cpu_active_mask.

A 'XXX Fix:' comment was added to highlight that if 'rq->rd ==
def_root_domain' AC should be performed against the capacity of the
CPU the task is running on rather the rd CPU capacity sum. This
issue already exists w/o capacity awareness.
