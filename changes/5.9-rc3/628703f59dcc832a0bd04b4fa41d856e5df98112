l2tp: return void from l2tp_session_delete

l2tp_session_delete is used to schedule a session instance for deletion.
The function itself always returns zero, and none of its direct callers
check its return value, so have the function return void.

This change de-facto changes the l2tp netlink session_delete callback
prototype since all pseudowires currently use l2tp_session_delete for
their implementation of that operation.
