KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Increase KVMPPC_NR_LPIDS on POWER8 and POWER9

POWER8 and POWER9 have 12-bit LPIDs. Change LPID_RSVD to support up to
(4096 - 2) guests on these processors. POWER7 is kept the same with a
limitation of (1024 - 2), but it might be time to drop KVM support for
POWER7.

Tested with 2048 guests * 4 vCPUs on a witherspoon system with 512G
RAM and a bit of swap.
