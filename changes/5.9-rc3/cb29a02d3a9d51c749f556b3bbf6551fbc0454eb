ext4: use generic names for generic ioctls

Don't define EXT4_IOC_* aliases to ioctls that already have a generic
FS_IOC_* name.  These aliases are unnecessary, and they make it unclear
which ioctls are ext4-specific and which are generic.

Exception: leave EXT4_IOC_GETVERSION_OLD and EXT4_IOC_SETVERSION_OLD
as-is for now, since renaming them to FS_IOC_GETVERSION and
FS_IOC_SETVERSION would probably make them more likely to be confused
with EXT4_IOC_GETVERSION and EXT4_IOC_SETVERSION which also exist.
