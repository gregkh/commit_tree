dt-bindings: display: ti, tfp410.yaml: Redefine ti, deskew property

This changes how the 'ti,deskew' property is defined. It's now an
unsigned value from 0 to 7 instead of a signed value from -4 to 3.
Until the dtc carries the integer sign through to the yaml output it's
easier to define signed types as unsigned.
