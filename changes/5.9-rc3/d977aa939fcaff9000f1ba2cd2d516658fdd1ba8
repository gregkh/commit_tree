mm, memcg: unify reclaim retry limits with page allocator

Reclaim retries have been set to 5 since the beginning of time in
commit 66e1707bc346 ("Memory controller: add per cgroup LRU and
reclaim").  However, we now have a generally agreed-upon standard for
page reclaim: MAX_RECLAIM_RETRIES (currently 16), added many years later
in commit 0a0337e0d1d1 ("mm, oom: rework oom detection").

In the absence of a compelling reason to declare an OOM earlier in memcg
context than page allocator context, it seems reasonable to supplant
MEM_CGROUP_RECLAIM_RETRIES with MAX_RECLAIM_RETRIES, making the page
allocator and memcg internals more similar in semantics when reclaim
fails to produce results, avoiding premature OOMs or throttling.
