Input: ims-pcu - return error code rather than -ENOMEM

Currently the assignment of -ENOMEM to error is redundant because error
is not being read and -ENOMEM is being hard coded as an error return.
Fix this by returning the error code in variable 'error'; this also
allows the error code from a failed call to input_register_device to
be preserved and returned to the caller rather than just returning
a possibly inappropriate -ENOMEM.

Kudos to Dan Carpenter for the suggestion of an improved fix.
