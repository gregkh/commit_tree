drm/i915/gt: Remove local entries from GGTT on suspend

Across suspend/resume, we clear the entire GGTT and rebuild from
scratch. In particular, we want to only preserve the global entries for
use by the HW, and delay reinstating the local binds until required by
the user. This means that we can evict any local binds in the global GTT,
saving any time in preserving their state, as they will be rebound on
demand.
