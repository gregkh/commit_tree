clk: at91: sam9x60-pll: check fcore against ranges

According to datasheet the range of 600-1200MHz is for the
frequency generated by the fractional part of the PLL (namely
Fcorepllck according to datasheet). With this in mind the output
range of the PLL itself (fractional + div), taking into account
that the divider is 8 bits wide, is 600/256-1200Hz=2.3-1200MHz.
