mlxsw: spectrum_span: On policer_id_base_ref_count, use dec_and_test

When unsetting policer base, the SPAN code currently uses refcount_dec().
However that function splats when the counter reaches zero, because
reaching zero without actually testing is in general indicative of a
missing cleanup. There is no cleanup to be done here, but nonetheless, use
refcount_dec_and_test() as required.
