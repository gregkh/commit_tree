drivers/rapidio/rio-scan.c: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version in
order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

Also, while there, use the preferred form for passing a size of a struct.
The alternative form where struct name is spelled out hurts readability
and introduces an opportunity for a bug when the pointer variable type is
changed but the corresponding sizeof that is passed as argument is not.

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and fixed
manually.
