spi: spi-sun6i: sun6i_spi_drain_fifo(): remove not needed length argument

The function sun6i_spi_drain_fifo() is called with a length argument of
"sspi->fifo_depth" and "SUN6I_FIFO_DEPTH".

The driver reads the number of available bytes to read from the FIFO from the
hardware and uses the length argument to limit this value. This is not needed
as the FIFO can contain only the fifo depth number of bytes.

This patch removes the length argument and check.
