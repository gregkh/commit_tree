Documentation: locking: Describe seqlock design and usage

Proper documentation for the design and usage of sequence counters and
sequential locks does not exist. Complete the seqlock.h documentation as
follows:

  - Divide all documentation on a seqcount_t vs. seqlock_t basis. The
    description for both mechanisms was intermingled, which is incorrect
    since the usage constrains for each type are vastly different.

  - Add an introductory paragraph describing the internal design of, and
    rationale for, sequence counters.

  - Document seqcount_t writer non-preemptibility requirement, which was
    not previously documented anywhere, and provide a clear rationale.

  - Provide template code for seqcount_t and seqlock_t initialization
    and reader/writer critical sections.

  - Recommend using seqlock_t by default. It implicitly handles the
    serialization and non-preemptibility requirements of writers.

At seqlock.h:

  - Remove references to brlocks as they've long been removed from the
    kernel.

  - Remove references to gcc-3.x since the kernel's minimum supported
    gcc version is 4.9.
