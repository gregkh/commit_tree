powerpc/watchpoint: Fix DAWR exception constraint

Pedro Miraglia Franco de Carvalho noticed that on p8/p9, DAR value is
inconsistent with different type of load/store. Like for byte,word
etc. load/stores, DAR is set to the address of the first byte of
overlap between watch range and real access. But for quadword load/
store it's sometime set to the address of the first byte of real
access whereas sometime set to the address of the first byte of
overlap. This issue has been fixed in p10. In p10(ISA 3.1), DAR is
always set to the address of the first byte of overlap. Commit 27985b2a640e
("powerpc/watchpoint: Don't ignore extraneous exceptions blindly")
wrongly assumes that DAR is set to the address of the first byte of
overlap for all load/stores on p8/p9 as well. Fix that. With the fix,
we now rely on 'ea' provided by analyse_instr(). If analyse_instr()
fails, generate event unconditionally on p8/p9, and on p10 generate
event only if DAR is within a DAWR range.

Note: 8xx is not affected.
