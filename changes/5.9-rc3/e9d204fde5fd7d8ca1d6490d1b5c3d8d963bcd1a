net: dsa: qca8k: Add define for port VID

Rather than using a magic value of 1 when configuring the port VIDs add
a QCA8K_PORT_VID_DEF define and use that instead. Also fix up the
bitmask in the process; the top 4 bits are reserved so this wasn't a
problem, but only masking 12 bits is the correct approach.
