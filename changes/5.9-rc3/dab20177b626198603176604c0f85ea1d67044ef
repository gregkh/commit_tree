intel_idle: Eliminate redundant static variable

The value of the lapic_timer_always_reliable static variable in
the intel_idle driver reflects the boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_ARAT)
value and so it also reflects the static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_ARAT)
value.

Hence, the lapic_timer_always_reliable check in intel_idle() is
redundant and apart from this lapic_timer_always_reliable is only
used in two places in which boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_ARAT) can be
used directly.

Eliminate the lapic_timer_always_reliable variable in accordance
with the above observations.

No intentional functional impact.
