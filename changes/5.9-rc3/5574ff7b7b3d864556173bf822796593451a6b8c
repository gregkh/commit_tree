i40e: optimize AF_XDP Tx completion path

Improve the performance of the AF_XDP zero-copy Tx completion
path. When there are no XDP buffers being sent using XDP_TX or
XDP_REDIRECT, we do not have go through the SW ring to clean up any
entries since the AF_XDP path does not use these. In these cases, just
fast forward the next-to-use counter and skip going through the SW
ring. The limit on the maximum number of entries to complete is also
removed since the algorithm is now O(1). To simplify the code path, the
maximum number of entries to complete for the XDP path is therefore
also increased from 256 to 512 (the default number of Tx HW
descriptors). This should be fine since the completion in the XDP path
is faster than in the SKB path that has 256 as the maximum number.

This patch provides around 4% throughput improvement for the l2fwd
application in xdpsock on my machine.
