drm/mm/selftests: fix wrong return type casting

Function prepare_igt_frag() and get_insert_time() were casting
signed value to unsigned value before returning error.
So error check in igt_frag() would not work with unsigned
return value from get_insert_time() compared against negative
value.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0, no effect")
