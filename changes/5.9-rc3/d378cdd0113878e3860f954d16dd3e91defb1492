platform/chrome: cros_ec_debugfs: Control uptime information request

When EC does not support uptime command (EC_CMD_GET_UPTIME_INFO),
do not create the uptime sysfs entry point.
User space application will not probe the file needlessly.

The EC console log will not contain EC_CMD_GET_UPTIME_INFO anymore.
