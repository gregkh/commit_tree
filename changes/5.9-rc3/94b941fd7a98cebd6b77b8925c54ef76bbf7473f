xfs: only reserve quota blocks if we're mapping into a hole

When logging quota block count updates during a reflink operation, we
only log the /delta/ of the block count changes to the dquot.  Since we
now know ahead of time the extent type of both dmap and smap (and that
they have the same length), we know that we only need to reserve quota
blocks for dmap's blockcount if we're mapping it into a hole.
