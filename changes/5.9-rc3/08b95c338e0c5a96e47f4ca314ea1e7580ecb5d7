fanotify: remove event FAN_DIR_MODIFY

It was never enabled in uapi and its functionality is about to be
superseded by events FAN_CREATE, FAN_DELETE, FAN_MOVE with group
flag FAN_REPORT_NAME.

Keep a place holder variable name_event instead of removing the
name recording code since it will be used by the new events.
