checkpatch: Remove awareness of uninitialized_var() macro

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings
(e.g. "unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized,
either simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes.

In preparation for removing[2] the[3] macro[4], partially revert
commit 16b7f3c89907 ("checkpatch: avoid warning about uninitialized_var()")
and remove all remaining mentions of uninitialized_var().
