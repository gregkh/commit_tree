net/mlx5e: Enhance TX timeout recovery

Upon a TX timeout handle, if the TX reporter was not able to recover
from the error, reopen the channels. If tried to reopen channels, do not
loop over TX queues for timeout.

With that, the reporters state and separation will better
expose the driver's state.
