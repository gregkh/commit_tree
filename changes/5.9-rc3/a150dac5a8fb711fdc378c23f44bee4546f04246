irqchip: Revert modular support for drivers using IRQCHIP_PLATFORM_DRIVER helperse

It has become obvious that switching a number of irqchip drivers
to being platform drivers without considering the platform was a
mistake. We have multiple reports of end-point drivers not
probing because the irqchip driver isn't there yet, breaking
the expectations of the users.

This patch reverts:

920ecb8c35cb ("irqchip/mtk-cirq: Convert to a platform driver")
f97dbf48ca43 ("irqchip/mtk-sysirq: Convert to a platform driver")
5be57099d445 ("irqchip/qcom-pdc: Switch to using IRQCHIP_PLATFORM_DRIVER helper macros")
95bf9305d2e3 ("irqchip/qcom-pdc: Allow QCOM_PDC to be loadable as a permanent module")

and leave QCOM PDC, MTK sysrq and cirq drivers as built-in, special purpose
drivers for the time being until we have worked out a better solution.
