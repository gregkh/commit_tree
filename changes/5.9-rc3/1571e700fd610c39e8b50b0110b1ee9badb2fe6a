net: phylink: in-band pause mode advertisement update for PCS

Re-code the pause in-band advertisement update in light of the addition
of PCS support, so that we perform the minimum required; only the PCS
configuration function needs to be called in this case, followed by the
request to trigger a restart of negotiation if the programmed
advertisement changed.

We need to change the pcs_config() signature to pass whether resolved
pause should be passed to the MAC for setups such as mvneta and mvpp2
where doing so overrides the MAC manual flow controls.
