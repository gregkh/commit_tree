scsi: lpfc: Add support to display if adapter dumps are available

Currently, if there has been an issue whereby an adapter dump was taken,
there is nothing displayed to hint that it is present. Utilities must be
run and they must query for the status in order to then download the dump.

Add a message to the driver to query dump image presence when initializing
the SLI Port.
