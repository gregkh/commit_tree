powerpc/pseries: Use doorbells even if XIVE is available

KVM supports msgsndp in guests by trapping and emulating the
instruction, so it was decided to always use XIVE for IPIs if it is
available. However on PowerVM systems, msgsndp can be used and gives
better performance. On large systems, high XIVE interrupt rates can
have sub-linear scaling, and using msgsndp can reduce the load on
the interrupt controller.

So switch to using core local doorbells even if XIVE is available.
This reduces performance for KVM guests with an SMT topology by
about 50% for ping-pong context switching between SMT vCPUs. An
option vector (or dt-cpu-ftrs) could be defined to disable msgsndp
to get KVM performance back.
