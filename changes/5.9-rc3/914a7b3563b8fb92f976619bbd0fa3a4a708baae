i2c: rcar: in slave mode, clear NACK earlier

Currently, a NACK in slave mode is set/cleared when SCL is held low by
the IP core right before the bit is about to be pushed out. This is too
late for clearing and then a NACK from the previous byte is still used
for the current one. Now, let's clear the NACK right after we detected
the STOP condition following the NACK.
