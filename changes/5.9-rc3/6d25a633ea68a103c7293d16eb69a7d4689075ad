lib: Prepare zstd for preboot environment, improve performance

These changes are necessary to get the build to work in the preboot
environment, and to get reasonable performance:

- Remove a double definition of the CHECK_F macro when the zstd
  library is amalgamated.

- Switch ZSTD_copy8() to __builtin_memcpy(), because in the preboot
  environment on x86 gcc can't inline `memcpy()` otherwise.

- Limit the gcc hack in ZSTD_wildcopy() to the broken gcc version. See
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=81388.

ZSTD_copy8() and ZSTD_wildcopy() are in the core of the zstd hot loop.
So outlining these calls to memcpy(), and having an extra branch are very
detrimental to performance.
