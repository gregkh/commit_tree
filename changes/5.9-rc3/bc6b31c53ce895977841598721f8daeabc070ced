arm64: dts: allwinner: h5: bananapi-m2-plus-v1.2: Tie in CPU OPPs

The Bananapi M2 Plus H5 v1.2 can work with the standard H5 OPPs.
Tie them in to enable CPU frequency scaling.

The original Bananapi M2 Plus H5 is left out for now, as adding
the fixed regulator along with the enable pin seemed to cause some
glitching in Linux.
