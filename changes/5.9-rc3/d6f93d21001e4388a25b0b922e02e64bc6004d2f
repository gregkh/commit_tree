usb: chipidea: imx: get available runtime dr mode for wakeup setting

If runtime dr_mode is not dual-role, it doesn't need to enable ID
wakeup interrupt.
If runtime dr_mode is host, it doesn't need to enable VBUS
wakeup interrupt.
With these changes, the user will not get the unexpected wakeup
for single role use case. For example, the host-only use case at
Micro-AB port, the controller should not be waken up by only
plug in Micro-AB cable or the Micro-B cable with host.
