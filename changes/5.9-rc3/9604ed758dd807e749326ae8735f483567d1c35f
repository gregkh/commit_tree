iio: magnetometer: ak8975: Add gpio reset support

According to AK09911 datasheet, if reset gpio is provided then
deassert reset on ak8975_power_on() and assert reset on ak8975_power_off().

Without reset's deassertion during ak8975_power_on(), driver's probe fails
on ak8975_who_i_am() while checking for device identity for AK09911 chip.

AK09911 has an active low reset gpio to handle register's reset.
AK09911 datasheet says that, if not used, reset pin should be connected
to VID. This patch emulates this situation.
