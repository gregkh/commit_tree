KVM: X86: Go on updating other CPUID leaves when leaf 1 is absent

As handling of bits out of leaf 1 added over time, kvm_update_cpuid()
should not return directly if leaf 1 is absent, but should go on
updateing other CPUID leaves.

Keep the update of apic->lapic_timer.timer_mode_mask in a separate
wrapper, to minimize churn for code since it will be moved out of this
function in a future patch.
