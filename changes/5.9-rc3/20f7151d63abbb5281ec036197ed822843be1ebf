bus: fsl-mc: probe the allocatable objects first

Because the DPNIs are probed before DPMCPs and other objects that need
to be allocated, messages like "No more resources of type X left" are
printed by the fsl-mc bus driver. This patch resolves the issue by probing
the allocatable objects first and then any other object that may use
them.
