samples: bpf: Refactor BPF map performance test with libbpf

Previously, in order to set the numa_node attribute at the time of map
creation using "libbpf", it was necessary to call bpf_create_map_node()
directly (bpf_load approach), instead of calling bpf_object_load()
that handles everything on its own, including map creation. And because
of this problem, this sample had problems with refactoring from bpf_load
to libbbpf.

However, by commit 1bdb6c9a1c43 ("libbpf: Add a bunch of attribute
getters/setters for map definitions") added the numa_node attribute and
allowed it to be set in the map.

By using libbpf instead of bpf_load, the inner map definition has
been explicitly declared with BTF-defined format. Also, the element of
ARRAY_OF_MAPS was also statically specified using the BTF format. And
for this reason some logic in fixup_map() was not needed and changed
or removed.
