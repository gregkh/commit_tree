xfs: Modify xlog_ticket_alloc() to use kernel's MM API

xlog_ticket_alloc() is always called under NOFS context, except from
unmount path, which eitherway is holding many FS locks, so, there is no
need for its callers to keep passing allocation flags into it.

change xlog_ticket_alloc() to use default kmem_cache_zalloc(), remove
its alloc_flags argument, and always use GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOFAIL flags.
