fs: introduce SB_INLINECRYPT

Introduce SB_INLINECRYPT, which is set by filesystems that wish to use
blk-crypto for file content en/decryption. This flag maps to the
'-o inlinecrypt' mount option which multiple filesystems will implement,
and code in fs/crypto/ needs to be able to check for this mount option
in a filesystem-independent way.
