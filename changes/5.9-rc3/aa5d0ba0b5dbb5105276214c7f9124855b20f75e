xfs: only reserve quota blocks for bmbt changes if we're changing the data fork

Now that we've reworked xfs_reflink_remap_extent to remap only one
extent per transaction, we actually know if the extent being removed is
an allocated mapping.  This means that we now know ahead of time if
we're going to be touching the data fork.

Since we only need blocks for a bmbt split if we're going to update the
data fork, we only need to get quota reservation if we know we're going
to touch the data fork.
