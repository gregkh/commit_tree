selftests/bpf: Prevent runqslower from racing on building bpftool

runqslower's Makefile is building/installing bpftool into
$(OUTPUT)/sbin/bpftool, which coincides with $(DEFAULT_BPFTOOL). In practice
this means that often when building selftests from scratch (after `make
clean`), selftests are racing with runqslower to simultaneously build bpftool
and one of the two processes fail due to file being busy. Prevent this race by
explicitly order-depending on $(BPFTOOL_DEFAULT).
