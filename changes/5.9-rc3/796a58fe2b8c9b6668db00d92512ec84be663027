ASoC: q6routing: add dummy register read/write function

Most of the DAPM widgets for DSP ASoC components reuse reg field
of the widgets for its internal calculations, however these are not
real registers. So read/writes to these numbers are not really
valid. However ASoC core will read these registers to get default
state during startup.

With recent changes to ASoC core, every register read/write
failures are reported very verbosely. Prior to this fails to reads
are totally ignored, so we never saw any error messages.

To fix this add dummy read/write function to return default value.
