bpf: Add BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_RELEASE hook

Sometimes it's handy to know when the socket gets freed. In
particular, we'd like to try to use a smarter allocation of
ports for bpf_bind and explore the possibility of limiting
the number of SOCK_DGRAM sockets the process can have.

Implement BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_RELEASE hook that triggers on
inet socket release. It triggers only for userspace sockets
(not in-kernel ones) and therefore has the same semantics as
the existing BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE.
