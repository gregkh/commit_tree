perf/x86/intel/lbr: Use dynamic data structure for task_ctx

The type of task_ctx is hardcoded as struct x86_perf_task_context,
which doesn't apply for Architecture LBR. For example, Architecture LBR
doesn't have the TOS MSR. The number of LBR entries is variable. A new
struct will be introduced for Architecture LBR. Perf has to determine
the type of task_ctx at run time.

The type of task_ctx pointer is changed to 'void *', which will be
determined at run time.

The generic LBR optimization can be shared between Architecture LBR and
model-specific LBR. Both need to access the structure for the generic
LBR optimization. A helper task_context_opt() is introduced to retrieve
the pointer of the structure at run time.
