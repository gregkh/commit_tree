net: sched: sch_red: Add qevents "early_drop" and "mark"

In order to allow acting on dropped and/or ECN-marked packets, add two new
qevents to the RED qdisc: "early_drop" and "mark". Filters attached at
"early_drop" block are executed as packets are early-dropped, those
attached at the "mark" block are executed as packets are ECN-marked.

Two new attributes are introduced: TCA_RED_EARLY_DROP_BLOCK with the block
index for the "early_drop" qevent, and TCA_RED_MARK_BLOCK for the "mark"
qevent. Absence of these attributes signifies "don't care": no block is
allocated in that case, or the existing blocks are left intact in case of
the change callback.

For purposes of offloading, blocks attached to these qevents appear with
newly-introduced binder types, FLOW_BLOCK_BINDER_TYPE_RED_EARLY_DROP and
FLOW_BLOCK_BINDER_TYPE_RED_MARK.
