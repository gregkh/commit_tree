farsync: use generic power management

The .suspend() and .resume() callbacks are not defined for this driver.
Still, their power management structure follows the legacy framework. To
bring it under the generic framework, simply remove the binding of
callbacks from "struct pci_driver".

Change code indentation from space to tab in "struct pci_driver".
