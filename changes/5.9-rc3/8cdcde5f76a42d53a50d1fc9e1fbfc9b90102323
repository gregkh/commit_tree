powerpc/52xx: Fix comment about CONFIG_BDI*

There's a comment in lite5200_sleep.S that refers to "CONFIG_BDI*".

This confuses scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py, which thinks it should
be able to find CONFIG_BDI.

Change the comment to refer to CONFIG_BDI_SWITCH which is presumably
roughly what it was referring to. AFAICS there never has been a
CONFIG_BDI.
