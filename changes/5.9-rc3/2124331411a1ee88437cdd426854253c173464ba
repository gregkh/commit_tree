spi: spi-qcom-qspi: Avoid clock setting if not needed

As per recent changes to the spi-qcom-qspi, now when we set the clock
we'll call into the interconnect framework and also call the OPP API.
Those are expensive operations.  Let's avoid calling them if possible.
This has a big impact on getting transfer rates back up to where they
were (or maybe slightly better) before those patches landed.
