xdp: Prevent kernel-infoleak in xsk_getsockopt()

xsk_getsockopt() is copying uninitialized stack memory to userspace when
'extra_stats' is 'false'. Fix it. Doing '= {};' is sufficient since currently
'struct xdp_statistics' is defined as follows:

  struct xdp_statistics {
    __u64 rx_dropped;
    __u64 rx_invalid_descs;
    __u64 tx_invalid_descs;
    __u64 rx_ring_full;
    __u64 rx_fill_ring_empty_descs;
    __u64 tx_ring_empty_descs;
  };

When being copied to the userspace, 'stats' will not contain any uninitialized
'holes' between struct fields.
