vt: move rescan_last_byte label earlier

This removes duplicated initialization of variables (after reordering
'c' initialization).

It will also allow for eliminating whole translation into a separate
function in the next patch.

Note that vc_state, vc_utf etc. are checked with every rescan now. But
they are immutable for non-control characters where rescan might be
only necessary.
