dt-bindings: iio/adc: Convert ingenic-adc docs to YAML.

Convert the textual documentation of Device Tree bindings for the
Ingenic JZ47xx SoCs ADC controller to YAML.

The `interrupts` property is now explicitly listed and marked as
required. While missing from the previous textual documentation, this
property has been used with all the boards which probe this driver.
