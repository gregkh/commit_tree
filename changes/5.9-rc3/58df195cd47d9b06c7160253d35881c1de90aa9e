optee: use uuid for sysfs driver entry

With the evolving use-cases for TEE bus, now it's required to support
multi-stage enumeration process. But using a simple index doesn't
suffice this requirement and instead leads to duplicate sysfs entries.
So instead switch to use more informative device UUID for sysfs entry
like:
/sys/bus/tee/devices/optee-ta-<uuid>
