l2tp: cleanup difficult-to-read line breaks

Some l2tp code had line breaks which made the code more difficult to
read.  These were originally motivated by the 80-character line width
coding guidelines, but were actually a negative from the perspective of
trying to follow the code.

Remove these linebreaks for clearer code, even if we do exceed 80
characters in width in some places.
