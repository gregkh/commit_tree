KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Cleanup updates for kvm vcpu MMCR

Currently `kvm_vcpu_arch` stores all Monitor Mode Control registers
in a flat array in order: mmcr0, mmcr1, mmcra, mmcr2, mmcrs
Split this to give mmcra and mmcrs its own entries in vcpu and
use a flat array for mmcr0 to mmcr2. This patch implements this
cleanup to make code easier to read.
