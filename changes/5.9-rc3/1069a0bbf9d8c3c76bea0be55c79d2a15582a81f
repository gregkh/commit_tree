arm64: dts: ls1043a: update USB nodes status to match board config

ls1043a-rdb and ls1043a-qds board’s default HW config (such as
pin mux selection) would not enable some USB controllers’
data path, which causing over-current detected on those
controllers. This will hit the case of ‘xhci driver prevent bus suspend
if a root hub port detected over-current condition’, causing system
failed to be suspended. So disable them in device tree to resolve this
issue.
