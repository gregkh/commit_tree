lockdep: Split header file into lockdep and lockdep_types

There is a header file inclusion loop between asm-generic/bug.h
and linux/kernel.h.  This causes potential compile failurs depending
on the which file is included first.  One way of breaking this loop
is to stop spinlock_types.h from including lockdep.h.  This patch
splits lockdep.h into two files for this purpose.
