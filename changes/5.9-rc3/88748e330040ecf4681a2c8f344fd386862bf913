trace: events: rcu: Change description of rcu_dyntick trace event

The different strings used for describing the polarity are
Start, End and StillNonIdle. Since StillIdle is not used in any trace
point for rcu_dyntick, it can be removed and StillNonIdle can be added
in the description. Because StillNonIdle is used in a few tracepoints for
rcu_dyntick.

Similarly, USER, IDLE and IRQ are used for describing context in
the rcu_dyntick tracepoints. Since, "KERNEL" is not used for any
of the rcu_dyntick tracepoints, remove it from the description.
