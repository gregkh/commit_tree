iio: adc: rockchip_saradc: Add support iio buffers

Add the ability to also support access via (triggered) buffers
next to the existing direct mode.

Device in question is the Odroid Go Advance that connects a joystick
to two of the saradc channels for X and Y axis and the new (and still
pending) adc joystick driver of course wants to use triggered buffers
from the iio subsystem.
