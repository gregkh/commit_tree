spi: Prevent adding devices below an unregistering controller

CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC and CONFIG_ACPI allow adding SPI devices at runtime
using a DeviceTree overlay or DSDT patch.  CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE allows the
same via sysfs.

But there are no precautions to prevent adding a device below a
controller that's being removed.  Such a device is unusable and may not
even be able to unbind cleanly as it becomes inaccessible once the
controller has been torn down.  E.g. it is then impossible to quiesce
the device's interrupt.

of_spi_notify() and acpi_spi_notify() do hold a ref on the controller,
but otherwise run lockless against spi_unregister_controller().

Fix by holding the spi_add_lock in spi_unregister_controller() and
bailing out of spi_add_device() if the controller has been unregistered
concurrently.
