x86/fpu/xstate: Add helpers for LBR dynamic supervisor feature

The perf subsystem will only need to save/restore the LBR state.
However, the existing helpers save all supported supervisor states to a
kernel buffer, which will be unnecessary. Two helpers are introduced to
only save/restore requested dynamic supervisor states. The supervisor
features in XFEATURE_MASK_SUPERVISOR_SUPPORTED and
XFEATURE_MASK_SUPERVISOR_UNSUPPORTED mask cannot be saved/restored using
these helpers.

The helpers will be used in the following patch.
