scsi: lpfc: Fix LUN loss after cable pull

On devices that support FCP sequence error recovery, which attempts to
preserve the devices login across link bounce, adisc is used for device
validation. Turns out the device fc4 type is cleared as part of the link
bounce, but the ADISC handling doesn't restore the FC4 support as it
normally would with a PRLI. This caused situations where the device wasn't
reregistered with the transport thus scan logic and LUN discovery never
kicked in.

In the ADISC completion handling, reset the fc4 type so that transport port
reregistration occurs with the remote port.
