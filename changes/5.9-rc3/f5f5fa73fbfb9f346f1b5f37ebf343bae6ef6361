media: videobuf2: handle V4L2 buffer cache flags

Set video buffer cache management flags corresponding to V4L2 cache
flags.

Both ->prepare() and ->finish() cache management hints should be
passed during this stage (buffer preparation), because there is
no other way for user-space to tell V4L2 to avoid ->finish() cache
flush.
