nfs: define nfs_access_get_cached function

The only consumer of nfs_access_get_cached_rcu and nfs_access_cached
calls these static functions in order to first try RCU access, and
then locked access.

Combine them in to a single function, and call that. Make this function
available to the rest of the NFS code.
