interconnect: Mark all dummy functions as static inline

There are a few dummy stub functions that are not marked as static inline
yet. Currently this header file is not included in any other file outside
of drivers/interconnect/, but that might not be the case in the future.
If this file gets included and the framework is disabled, we will be see
warnings. Let's fix this in advance.
