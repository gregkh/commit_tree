selftests/bpf: Omit nodad flag when adding addresses to loopback

Setting IFA_F_NODAD flag for IPv6 addresses to add to loopback is
unnecessary. Duplicate Address Detection does not happen on loopback
device.

Also, passing 'nodad' flag to 'ip address' breaks libbpf CI, which runs in
an environment with BusyBox implementation of 'ip' command, that doesn't
understand this flag.
