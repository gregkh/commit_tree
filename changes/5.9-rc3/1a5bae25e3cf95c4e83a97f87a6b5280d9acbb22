mm/vmstat: add events for THP migration without split

Add following new vmstat events which will help in validating THP
migration without split.  Statistics reported through these new VM events
will help in performance debugging.

1. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS
2. THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE
3. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT

In addition, these new events also update normal page migration statistics
appropriately via PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAILURE.  While here,
this updates current trace event 'mm_migrate_pages' to accommodate now
available THP statistics.
