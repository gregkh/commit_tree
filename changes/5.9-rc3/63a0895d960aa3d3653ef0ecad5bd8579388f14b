compiler: Remove uninitialized_var() macro

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings
(e.g. "unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized,
either simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes.

As recommended[2] by[3] Linus[4], remove the macro. With the recent
change to disable -Wmaybe-uninitialized in v5.7 in commit 78a5255ffb6a
("Stop the ad-hoc games with -Wno-maybe-initialized"), this is likely
the best time to make this treewide change.
