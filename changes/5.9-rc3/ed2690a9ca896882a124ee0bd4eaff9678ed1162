drm/i915/selftest: Check that GPR are restored across noa_wait

Perf implements a GPU delay (noa_wait) by looping until the CS timestamp
has passed a certain point. This use MI_MATH and the general purpose
registers of the user's context, and since it is clobbering the user
state it must carefully save and restore the user's data around the
noa_wait. We can verify this by loading some values in the GPR that we
know will be clobbered by the noa_wait, and then inspecting the GPR after
the noa_wait completes and confirming that they have been restored.
