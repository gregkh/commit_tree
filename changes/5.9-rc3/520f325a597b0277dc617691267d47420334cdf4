crypto: ccree - adapt ccree essiv support to kcapi

The ESSIV support in ccree was added before the kernel
generic support and using a slightly different API.

Brings the ccree essiv interface into compliance with
kernel crypto api one.

Since CryptoCell only support 256 bit AES key for ESSIV,
also use a fallback if requested a smaller key size.
