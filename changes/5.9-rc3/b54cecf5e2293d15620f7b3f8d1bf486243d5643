fsnotify: pass dir argument to handle_event() callback

The 'inode' argument to handle_event(), sometimes referred to as
'to_tell' is somewhat obsolete.
It is a remnant from the times when a group could only have an inode mark
associated with an event.

We now pass an iter_info array to the callback, with all marks associated
with an event.

Most backends ignore this argument, with two exceptions:
1. dnotify uses it for sanity check that event is on directory
2. fanotify uses it to report fid of directory on directory entry
   modification events

Remove the 'inode' argument and add a 'dir' argument.
The callback function signature is deliberately changed, because
the meaning of the argument has changed and the arguments have
been documented.

The 'dir' argument is set to when 'file_name' is specified and it is
referring to the directory that the 'file_name' entry belongs to.
