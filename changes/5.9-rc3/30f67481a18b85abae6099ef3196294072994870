scsi: scsi_debug: Update documentation url and bump version

This driver maintains a version number which is cross-referenced in the
documentation (e.g. to indicate when features are added or changed) and
exposed through the responses to various SCSI commands. For example the
version number is use as the Product Revision number in standard SCSI
INQUIRY responses issued by this driver. The version date string is placed
in a vendor specific area in each standard SCSI INQUIRY response. This
patch bumps both.

Update the driver documentation URL that appears at the top of the driver
source file.
