misc: lkdtm: bugs: At least try to use popuated variable

The result may not be intereresting, but not using a set variable
is bad form and causes W=1 kernel builds to complain.

Fixes the following W=1 warning(s):

 drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c: In function ‘lkdtm_STACK_GUARD_PAGE_LEADING’:
 drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c:331:25: warning: variable ‘byte’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 331 | volatile unsigned char byte;
 | ^~~~
 drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c: In function ‘lkdtm_STACK_GUARD_PAGE_TRAILING’:
 drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c:345:25: warning: variable ‘byte’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 345 | volatile unsigned char byte;
 | ^~~~
