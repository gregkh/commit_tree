habanalabs: Extract ECC information from FW

ECC (Error Correcting Code) interrupts are going to be handled
by the FW. Hence, we define an interface in which the driver can
obtain the relevant ECC information.
This information is needed for monitoring and can also lead
to a hard reset if ECC error is not correctable.
