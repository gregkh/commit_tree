bpf, selftests: Use single cgroup helpers for both test_sockmap/progs

Nearly every user of cgroup helpers does the same sequence of API calls. So
push these into a single helper cgroup_setup_and_join. The cases that do
a bit of extra logic are test_progs which currently uses an env variable
to decide if it needs to setup the cgroup environment or can use an
existingi environment. And then tests that are doing cgroup tests
themselves. We skip these cases for now.
