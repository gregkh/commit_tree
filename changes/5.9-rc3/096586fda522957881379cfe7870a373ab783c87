KVM: nSVM: Correctly set the shadow NPT root level in its MMU role

Move the initialization of shadow NPT MMU's shadow_root_level into
kvm_init_shadow_npt_mmu() and explicitly set the level in the shadow NPT
MMU's role to be the TDP level.  This ensures the role and MMU levels
are synchronized and also initialized before __kvm_mmu_new_pgd(), which
consumes the level when attempting a fast PGD switch.
