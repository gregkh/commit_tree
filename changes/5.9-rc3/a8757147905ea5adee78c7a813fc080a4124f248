ip6_vti: not register vti_ipv6_handler twice

An xfrm6_tunnel object is linked into the list when registering,
so vti_ipv6_handler can not be registered twice, otherwise its
next pointer will be overwritten on the second time.

So this patch is to define a new xfrm6_tunnel object to register
for AF_INET.
