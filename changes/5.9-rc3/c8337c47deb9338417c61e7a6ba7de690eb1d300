s390/ap: rework crypto config info and default domain code

Rework of the QCI crypto info and how it is used.
This is only a internal rework but does not affect the way
how the ap bus acts with ap card and queue devices and
domain handling.

Tested on z15, z14, z12 (QCI support) and z196 (no QCI support).
