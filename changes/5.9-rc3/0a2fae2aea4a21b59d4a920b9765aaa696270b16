lib: update DEBUG_SHIRQ docs to match reality

There is no extra interrupt when registering a shared interrupt handler
since 2011. Update the Kconfig text to make it clear and to avoid wrong
assumptions when debugging issues found by it.

Fixes: 6d83f94db95c ("genirq: Disable the SHIRQ_DEBUG call in request_threaded_irq for now")
