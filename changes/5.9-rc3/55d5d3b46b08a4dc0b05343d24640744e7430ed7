leds: multicolor: Introduce a multicolor class definition

Introduce a multicolor class that groups colored LEDs
within a LED node.

The multicolor class groups monochrome LEDs and allows controlling two
aspects of the final combined color: hue and lightness. The former is
controlled via the intensity file and the latter is controlled
via brightness file.
