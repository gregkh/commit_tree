ice: add link lenient and default override support

Adds functions to check for link override firmware support and get
the override settings for a port. The previously supported/default link
mode was strict mode.

In strict mode link is configured based on get PHY capabilities PHY types
with media.

Lenient mode is now the default link mode. In lenient mode the link is
configured based on get PHY capabilities PHY types without media. This
allows the user to configure link that the media does not report. Limit the
minimum supported link mode to 25G for devices that support 100G, and 1G
for devices that support less than 100G.

Default override is only supported in lenient mode. If default override
is supported and enabled, then default override values are used for
configuring speed and FEC. Default override provide persistent link
settings in the NVM.
