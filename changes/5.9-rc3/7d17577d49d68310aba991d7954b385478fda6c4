iio: humidity: hts221: remove usage of iio_priv_to_dev()

We may want to get rid of the iio_priv_to_dev() helper. That's a bit
uncertain at this point. The reason is that we will hide some of the
members of the iio_dev structure (to prevent drivers from accessing them
directly), and that will also mean hiding the implementation of the
iio_priv_to_dev() helper inside the IIO core.

Hiding the implementation of iio_priv_to_dev() implies that some fast-paths
may not be fast anymore, so a general idea is to try to get rid of the
iio_priv_to_dev() altogether.

For this driver, removing the iio_priv_to_dev() helper means passing the
iio_dev object on hts221_allocate_buffers() & hts221_allocate_trigger().
