mm/vmalloc.c: remove BUG() from the find_va_links()

Get rid of BUG() macro, that should be used only when a critical situation
happens and a system is not able to function anymore.

Replace it with WARN() macro instead, dump some extra information about
start/end addresses of both VAs which overlap.  Such overlap data can help
to figure out what happened making further analysis easier.  For example
if both areas are identical it could mean a double free.

A recovery process consists of declining all further steps regarding
inserting of conflicting overlap range.  In that sense find_va_links() now
can return NULL, so its return value has to be checked by callers.

Side effect of such process is it can leak memory, but it is better than
just killing a machine for no good reason.  Apart of that a debugging
process can be done on alive system.
