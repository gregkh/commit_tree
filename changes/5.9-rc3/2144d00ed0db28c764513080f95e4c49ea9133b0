backlight: backlight: Introduce backlight_get_brightness()

Based on an idea from Emil Velikov, add a helper that checks
backlight_is_blank() and return 0 as brightness if display is blank or
the property value if not.

This allows us to simplify the update_status() implementation
in most of the backlight drivers.
