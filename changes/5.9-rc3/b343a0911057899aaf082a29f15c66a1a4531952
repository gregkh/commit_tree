mmc: sdhci-acpi: For amd device set driver type as MMC_SET_DRIVER_TYPE_A

HS400/HS200/eMMC HS doesn't have Preset Value register.
Hence, sdhci_set_ios function overrides the value set by fmw to
SDHCI_CTRL_DRV_TYPE_B.
This patch sets drv_type to MMC_SET_DRIVER_TYPE_A
so that host_control2 register gets updated with the required
strength value.
