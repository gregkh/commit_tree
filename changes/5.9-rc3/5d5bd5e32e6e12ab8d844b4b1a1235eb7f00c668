drm/amdgpu: restrict the hw sched jobs number to power of two

the module parameter sched_hw_submission is probably from user mode,
and the kernel need to check whether it is legal.

1. align hw sched jobs to power of 2 and set minimum number is 2.
2. use kernel api is_power_of_2() to simplify driver code.
