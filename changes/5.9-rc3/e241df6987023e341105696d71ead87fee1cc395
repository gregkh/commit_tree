gpu/drm: Remove debug info about CPU address

When I update the latest kernel, I see the following "____ptrval____" boot
messages.

[    1.872600] radeon 0000:01:05.0: fence driver on ring 0 use gpu addr 0x0000000048000c00 and cpu addr 0x(____ptrval____)
[    1.879095] radeon 0000:01:05.0: fence driver on ring 5 use gpu addr 0x0000000040056038 and cpu addr 0x(____ptrval____)

Both radeon_fence_driver_start_ring() and amdgpu_fence_driver_start_ring()
have the similar issue, there exists the following two methods to solve it:
(1) Use "%pK" instead of "%p" so that the CPU address can be printed when
the kptr_restrict sysctl is set to 1.
(2) Just completely drop the CPU address suggested by Christian, because
the CPU address was useful in the past, but isn't any more. We now have a
debugfs file to read the current fence values.

Since the CPU address is not much useful, just remove the debug info about
CPU address.
