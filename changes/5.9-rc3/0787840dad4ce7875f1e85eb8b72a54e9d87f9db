l2tp: cleanup netlink tunnel create address handling

When creating an L2TP tunnel using the netlink API, userspace must
either pass a socket FD for the tunnel to use (for managed tunnels),
or specify the tunnel source/destination address (for unmanaged
tunnels).

Since source/destination addresses may be AF_INET or AF_INET6, the l2tp
netlink code has conditionally compiled blocks to support IPv6.

Rather than embedding these directly into l2tp_nl_cmd_tunnel_create
(where it makes the code difficult to read and confuses checkpatch to
boot) split the handling of address-related attributes into a separate
function.
