RDMA/bnxt_re: introduce a function to allocate swq

The bnxt_re driver now allocates shadow sq and rq to maintain per wqe
wr_id and few other flags required to support variable wqe. Segregated the
allocation of shadow queue in a separate function and adjust the cqe
polling logic. The new polling logic is based on shadow queue indices.
