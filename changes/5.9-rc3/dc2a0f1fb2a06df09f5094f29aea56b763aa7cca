timers: Always keep track of next expiry

So far next expiry was only tracked while the CPU was in nohz_idle mode
in order to cope with missing ticks that can't increment the base->clk
periodically anymore.

This logic is going to be expanded beyond nohz in order to spare timer
softirqs so do it unconditionally.
