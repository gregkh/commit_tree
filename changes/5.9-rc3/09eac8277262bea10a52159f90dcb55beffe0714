drm/i915/tgl+: Fix TBT DPLL fractional divider for 38.4MHz ref clock

When the reference clock is 38.4MHz, using the current TBT PLL
fractional divider value results in a slightly off TBT link frequency.
This causes an endless loop of link training success followed by a bad
link signaling and retraining at least on a Dell WD19TB TBT dock.  The
workaround provided by the HW team is to divide the fractional divider
value by two. This fixed the link training problem on the ThinkPad dock.

The same workaround is needed on some EHL platforms and for combo PHY
PLLs, these will be addressed in a follow-up.
