vdpasim: support batch updating

The vDPA simulator support both set_map() and dma_map()/dma_unmap()
operations. But vhost-vdpa can only use one of them. So this patch
introduce a module parameter (batch_mapping) that let vpda_sim to
support only one of those dma operations. The batched mapping via
set_map() is enabled by default.
