PCI: Release IVRS table in AMD ACS quirk

The acpi_get_table() should be coupled with acpi_put_table() if the mapped
table is not used at runtime to release the table mapping.

In pci_quirk_amd_sb_acs(), IVRS table is just used for checking AMD IOMMU
is supported, not used at runtime, so put the table after using it.
