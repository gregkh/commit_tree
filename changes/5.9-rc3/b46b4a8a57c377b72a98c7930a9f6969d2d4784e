hv_utils: drain the timesync packets on onchannelcallback

There could be instances where a system stall prevents the timesync
packets to be consumed. And this might lead to more than one packet
pending in the ring buffer. Current code empties one packet per callback
and it might be a stale one. So drain all the packets from ring buffer
on each callback.
