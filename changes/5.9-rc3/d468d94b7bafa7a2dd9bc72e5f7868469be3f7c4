KVM: x86: Dynamically calculate TDP level from max level and MAXPHYADDR

Calculate the desired TDP level on the fly using the max TDP level and
MAXPHYADDR instead of doing the same when CPUID is updated.  This avoids
the hidden dependency on cpuid_maxphyaddr() in vmx_get_tdp_level() and
also standardizes the "use 5-level paging iff MAXPHYADDR > 48" behavior
across x86.
