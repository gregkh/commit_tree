lib: Add zstd support to decompress

- Add unzstd() and the zstd decompress interface.

- Add zstd support to decompress_method().

The decompress_method() and unzstd() functions are used to decompress
the initramfs and the initrd. The __decompress() function is used in
the preboot environment to decompress a zstd compressed kernel.

The zstd decompression function allows the input and output buffers to
overlap because that is used by x86 kernel decompression.
