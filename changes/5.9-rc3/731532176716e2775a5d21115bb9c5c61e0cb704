KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Change default outer cacheability for {PEND, PROP}BASER

PENDBASER and PROPBASER define the outer caching mode for LPI tables.
The memory backing them may not be outer sharable, so we mark them as nC
by default. This however, breaks Windows on ARM which only accepts
SameAsInner or RaWaWb as values for outer cachability.

We do today already allow the outer mode to be set to SameAsInner
explicitly, so the easy fix is to default to that instead of nC for
situations when an OS asks for a not fulfillable cachability request.

This fixes booting Windows in KVM with vgicv3 and ITS enabled for me.
