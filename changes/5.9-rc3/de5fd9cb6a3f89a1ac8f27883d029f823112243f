spi: altera: fix driver matching failure of the device ID "spi_altera"

The driver is expected to support device ID "spi_altera" for MMIO accessed
devices, device ID "subdev_spi_altera" for indirect accessed devices. But
the platform bus will not try driver name match anymore if the platform
driver has an id_table. So the "spi_altera" should also be added to
id_table.
