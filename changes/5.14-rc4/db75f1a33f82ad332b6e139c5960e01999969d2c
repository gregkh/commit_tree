KVM: arm64: vgic: move irq->get_input_level into an ops structure

We already have the option to attach a callback to an interrupt
to retrieve its pending state. As we are planning to expand this
facility, move this callback into its own data structure.

This will limit the size of individual interrupts as the ops
structures can be shared across multiple interrupts.
