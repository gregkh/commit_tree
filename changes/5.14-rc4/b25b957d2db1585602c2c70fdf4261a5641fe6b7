scsi: iscsi: Use system_unbound_wq for destroy_work

Use the system_unbound_wq for async session destruction. We don't need a
dedicated workqueue for async session destruction because:

 1. perf does not seem to be an issue since we only allow 1 active work.

 2. it does not have deps with other system works and we can run them in
    parallel with each other.
