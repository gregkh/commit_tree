usb: max-3421: Prevent corruption of freed memory

The MAX-3421 USB driver remembers the state of the USB toggles for a
device/endpoint. To save SPI writes, this was only done when a new
device/endpoint was being used. Unfortunately, if the old device was
removed, this would cause writes to freed memory.

To fix this, a simpler scheme is used. The toggles are read from
hardware when a URB is completed, and the toggles are always written to
hardware when any URB transaction is started. This will cause a few more
SPI transactions, but no causes kernel panics.
