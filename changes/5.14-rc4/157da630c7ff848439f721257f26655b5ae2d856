dt-bindings: add compatible vendor prefix for Forlinx

Baoding Forlinx Embedded Technology Co., Ltd. is the manufacturer of the
Allwinner R40/A40i-powered FETA40i-C SoM and the OKA40i-C dev/carrier board
based on it.

This patch adds the DT vendor prefix for Forlinx in preparation for a
further patch, which includes a devicetree for the OKA40i-C board.
