ARM: 9093/1: drivers: firmwapsci: Register with kernel restart handler

Register with kernel restart handler instead of setting arm_pm_restart
directly. This enables support for replacing the PSCI restart handler
with a different handler if necessary for a specific board.

Select a priority of 129 to indicate a higher than default priority, but
keep it as low as possible since PSCI reset is known to fail on some
boards.
