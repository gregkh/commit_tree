drm/i915/dsc: abstract helpers to get bigjoiner primary/secondary crtc

Add a single point of truth for figuring out the primary/secondary crtc
for bigjoiner instead of duplicating the magic pipe +/- 1 in multiple
places.

Also fix the pipe validity checks to properly take non-contiguous pipes
into account. The current checks may theoretically overflow
i915->pipe_to_crtc_mapping[pipe], albeit with a warning, due to fused
off pipes, as INTEL_NUM_PIPES() returns the actual number of pipes on
the platform, and the check is for INTEL_NUM_PIPES() == pipe + 1.

Prefer primary/secondary terminology going forward.

v2:
- Improved abstractions for pipe validity etc.
