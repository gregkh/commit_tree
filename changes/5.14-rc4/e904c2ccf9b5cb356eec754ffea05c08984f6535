mm: mmap_lock: fix disabling preemption directly

Commit 832b50725373 ("mm: mmap_lock: use local locks instead of
disabling preemption") fixed a bug by using local locks.

But commit d01079f3d0c0 ("mm/mmap_lock: remove dead code for
!CONFIG_TRACING configurations") changed those lines back to the
original version.

I guess it was introduced by fixing conflicts.
