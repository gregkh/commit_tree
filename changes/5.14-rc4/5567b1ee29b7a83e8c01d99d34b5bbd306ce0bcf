powerpc/64s: fix hash page fault interrupt handler

The early bad fault or key fault test in do_hash_fault() ends up calling
into ___do_page_fault without having gone through an interrupt handler
wrapper (except the initial _RAW one). This can end up calling local irq
functions while the interrupt has not been reconciled, which will likely
cause crashes and it trips up on a later patch that adds more assertions.

pkey_exec_prot from selftests causes this path to be executed.

There is no real reason to run the in_nmi() test should be performed
before the key fault check. In fact if a perf interrupt in the hash
fault code did a stack walk that was made to take a key fault somehow
then running ___do_page_fault could possibly cause another hash fault
causing problems. Move the in_nmi() test first, and then do everything
else inside the regular interrupt handler function.
