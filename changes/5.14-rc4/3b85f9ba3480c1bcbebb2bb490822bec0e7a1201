net: bridge: mcast: export multicast router presence adjacent to a port

To properly support routable multicast addresses in batman-adv in a
group-aware way, a batman-adv node needs to know if it serves multicast
routers.

This adds a function to the bridge to export this so that batman-adv
can then make full use of the Multicast Router Discovery capability of
the bridge.
