rtnetlink: add IFLA_PARENT_[DEV|DEV_BUS]_NAME

In some cases, for example in the upcoming WWAN framework changes,
there's no natural "parent netdev", so sometimes dummy netdevs are
created or similar. IFLA_PARENT_DEV_NAME is a new attribute intended to
contain a device (sysfs, struct device) name that can be used instead
when creating a new netdev, if the rtnetlink family implements it.

As suggested by Parav Pandit, we also introduce IFLA_PARENT_DEV_BUS_NAME
attribute in order to uniquely identify a device on the system (with
bus/name pair).

ip-link(8) support for the generic parent device attributes will help
us avoid code duplication, so no other link type will require a custom
code to handle the parent name attribute. E.g. the WWAN interface
creation command will looks like this:

$ ip link add wwan0-1 parent-dev wwan0 type wwan channel-id 1

So, some future subsystem (or driver) FOO will have an interface
creation command that looks like this:

$ ip link add foo1-3 parent-dev foo1 type foo bar-id 3 baz-type Y

Below is an example of dumping link info of a random device with these
new attributes:

$ ip --details link show wlp0s20f3
  4: wlp0s20f3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue
     state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
     ...
     parent_bus pci parent_dev 0000:00:14.3
