ACPI: scan: initialize local variable to avoid garbage being returned

In the unlikely event that there are no callback calls made in
acpi_walk_dep_device_list(), local variable ret will be returned as
an uninitialized value.

Clean up static analysis warnings by ensuring ret is initialized.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
