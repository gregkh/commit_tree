drm/amdgpu: flush TLB if valid PDE turns into PTE

Mapping huge page, 2MB aligned address with 2MB size, uses PDE0 as PTE.
If previously valid PDE0, PDE0.V=1 and PDE0.P=0 turns into PTE, this
requires TLB flush, otherwise page table walker will not read updated
PDE0.

Change page table update mapping to return table_freed flag to indicate
the previously valid PDE may have turned into a PTE if page table is
freed.
