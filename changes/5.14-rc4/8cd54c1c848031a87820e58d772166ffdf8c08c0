iov_iter: separate direction from flavour

Instead of having them mixed in iter->type, use separate ->iter_type
and ->data_source (u8 and bool resp.)  And don't bother with (pseudo-)
bitmap for the former - microoptimizations from being able to check
if the flavour is one of two values are not worth the confusion for
optimizer.  It can't prove that we never get e.g. ITER_IOVEC | ITER_PIPE,
so we end up with extra headache.
