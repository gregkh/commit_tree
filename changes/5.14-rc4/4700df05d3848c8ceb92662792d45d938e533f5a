watchdog: fix syntactic kernel-doc issues

The command 'find drivers/watchdog | xargs ./scripts/kernel-doc -none'
reports a number of kernel-doc warnings in the watchdog subsystem.

Address the kernel-doc warnings that were purely syntactic issues with
kernel-doc comments.

The remaining kernel-doc warnings are of type "Excess function parameter"
and "Function parameter or member not described". These warnings would
need to be addressed in a second pass with a bit more insight into the
APIs and purpose of the functions in the watchdog subsystem.
