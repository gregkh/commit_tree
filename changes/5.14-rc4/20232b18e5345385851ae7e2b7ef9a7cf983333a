s390/mcck: cleanup use of cleanup_sie_mcck

cleanup_sie_mcck label is called from a single location only
and thus does not need to be a subroutine. Move the labelled
code to the caller - by doing that the SIE critical section
checks appear next to each other and the SIE cleanup becomes
bit more readable.
