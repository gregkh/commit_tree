phy: Allow a NULL phy name for devm_phy_get()

For a single PHY, there's no reason to have a phy-names entry in DT.
The DT specific get functions allow for this already, but devm_phy_get()
WARNs in this case. Other subsystems also don't warn in their get
functions. Let's drop the WARN for DT case in devm_phy_get().
