mptcp: restrict values of 'enabled' sysctl

To avoid confusions, it seems better to parse this sysctl parameter as a
boolean. We use it as a boolean, no need to parse an integer and bring
confusions if we see a value different from 0 and 1, especially with
this parameter name: enabled.

It seems fine to do this modification because the default value is 1
(enabled). Then the only other interesting value to set is 0 (disabled).
All other values would not have changed the default behaviour.
