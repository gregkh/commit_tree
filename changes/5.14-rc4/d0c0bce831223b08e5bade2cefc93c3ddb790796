firmware: arm_ffa: Setup in-kernel users of FFA partitions

Parse the FFA nodes from the device-tree and register all the partitions
whose services will be used in the kernel.

In order to also enable in-kernel users of FFA interface, let us add
simple set of operations for such devices.

The in-kernel users are registered without the character device interface.
