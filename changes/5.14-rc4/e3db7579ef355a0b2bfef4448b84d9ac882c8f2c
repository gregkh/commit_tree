KVM: selftests: Add exception handling support for aarch64

Add the infrastructure needed to enable exception handling in aarch64
selftests. The exception handling defaults to an unhandled-exception
handler which aborts the test, just like x86. These handlers can be
overridden by calling vm_install_exception_handler(vector) or
vm_install_sync_handler(vector, ec). The unhandled exception reporting
from the guest is done using the ucall type introduced in a previous
commit, UCALL_UNHANDLED.

The exception handling code is inspired on kvm-unit-tests.
