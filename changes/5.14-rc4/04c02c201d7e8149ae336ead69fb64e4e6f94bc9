KVM: arm64: Document MTE capability and ioctl

A new capability (KVM_CAP_ARM_MTE) identifies that the kernel supports
granting a guest access to the tags, and provides a mechanism for the
VMM to enable it.

A new ioctl (KVM_ARM_MTE_COPY_TAGS) provides a simple way for a VMM to
access the tags of a guest without having to maintain a PROT_MTE mapping
in userspace. The above capability gates access to the ioctl.
