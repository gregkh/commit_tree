habanalabs: refactor init device cpu code

Replace multiple arguments to init device CPU function by passing
firmware loader managing structure that is initialized per ASIC with
the loader parameters.

In addition, the FW loader management structure is now part of the
habanalabs device, this way the loader parameters will be able to be
communicated across various boot stages.
