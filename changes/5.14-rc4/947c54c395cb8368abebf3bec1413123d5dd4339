net: ena: Use dev_alloc() in RX buffer allocation

Use dev_alloc() when allocating RX buffers instead of specifying the
allocation flags explicitly. This result in same behaviour with less
code.

Also move the page allocation and its DMA mapping into a function. This
creates a logical block, which may help understanding the code.
