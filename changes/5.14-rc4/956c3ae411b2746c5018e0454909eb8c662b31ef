net: hns3: fix a double shift bug

These flags are used to set and test bits like this:

	if (!test_bit(HCLGE_PTP_FLAG_TX_EN, &ptp->flags) ||

The issue is that test_bit() takes a bit number like 1, but we are
passing BIT(1) instead and it's testing BIT(BIT(1)).  This does not
cause a problem because it is always done consistently and the bit
values are very small.
