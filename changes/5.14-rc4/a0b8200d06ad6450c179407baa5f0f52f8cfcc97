kbuild: skip per-CPU BTF generation for pahole v1.18-v1.21

Commit "mm/page_alloc: convert per-cpu list protection to local_lock" will
introduce a zero-sized per-CPU variable, which causes pahole to generate
invalid BTF.  Only pahole versions 1.18 through 1.21 are impacted, as
before 1.18 pahole doesn't know anything about per-CPU variables, and 1.22
contains the proper fix for the issue.

Luckily, pahole 1.18 got --skip_encoding_btf_vars option disabling BTF
generation for per-CPU variables in anticipation of some unanticipated
problems.  So use this escape hatch to disable per-CPU var BTF info on
those problematic pahole versions.  Users relying on availability of
per-CPU var BTFs would need to upgrade to pahole 1.22+, but everyone won't
notice any regressions.
