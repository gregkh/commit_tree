loop: charge i/o to mem and blk cg

The current code only associates with the existing blkcg when aio is used
to access the backing file.  This patch covers all types of i/o to the
backing file and also associates the memcg so if the backing file is on
tmpfs, memory is charged appropriately.

This patch also exports cgroup_get_e_css and int_active_memcg so it can be
used by the loop module.
