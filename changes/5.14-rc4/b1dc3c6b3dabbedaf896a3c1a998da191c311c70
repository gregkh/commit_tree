arm64: dts: qcom: sm8150: Disable Adreno and modem by default

Components that rely on proprietary (not to mention signed!) firmware should
not be enabled by default, as lack of the aforementioned firmware could cause
various issues, from random errors to straight-up failing to boot.

Not enabling modem back on the HDK, as it uses a sa8150.

Also fixed a sorting mistake in both boards' dt while at it.
