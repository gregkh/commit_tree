gve: Add dqo descriptors

General description of rings and descriptors:

TX ring is used for sending TX packet buffers to the NIC. It has the
following descriptors:
- `gve_tx_pkt_desc_dqo` - Data buffer descriptor
- `gve_tx_tso_context_desc_dqo` - TSO context descriptor
- `gve_tx_general_context_desc_dqo` - Generic metadata descriptor

Metadata is a collection of 12 bytes. We define `gve_tx_metadata_dqo`
which represents the logical interpetation of the metadata bytes. It's
helpful to define this structure because the metadata bytes exist in
multiple descriptor types (including `gve_tx_tso_context_desc_dqo`),
and the device requires same field has the same value in all
descriptors.

The TX completion ring is used to receive completions from the NIC.
Having a separate ring allows for completions to be out of order. The
completion descriptor `gve_tx_compl_desc` has several different types,
most important are packet and descriptor completions. Descriptor
completions are used to notify the driver when descriptors sent on the
TX ring are done being consumed. The descriptor completion is only used
to signal that space is cleared in the TX ring. A packet completion will
be received when a packet transmitted on the TX queue is done being
transmitted.

In addition there are "miss" and "reinjection" completions. The device
implements a "flow-miss model". Most packets will simply receive a
packet completion. The flow-miss system may choose to process a packet
based on its contents. A TX packet which experiences a flow miss would
receive a miss completion followed by a later reinjection completion.
The miss-completion is received when the packet starts to be processed
by the flow-miss system and the reinjection completion is received when
the flow-miss system completes processing the packet and sends it on the
wire.

The RX buffer ring is used to send buffers to HW via the
`gve_rx_desc_dqo` descriptor.

Received packets are put into the RX queue by the device, which
populates the `gve_rx_compl_desc_dqo` descriptor. The RX descriptors
refer to buffers posted by the buffer queue. Received buffers may be
returned out of order, such as when HW LRO is enabled.

Important concepts:
- "TX" and "RX buffer" queues, which send descriptors to the device, use
  MMIO doorbells to notify the device of new descriptors.

- "RX" and "TX completion" queues, which receive descriptors from the
  device, use a "generation bit" to know when a descriptor was populated
  by the device. The driver initializes all bits with the "current
  generation". The device will populate received descriptors with the
  "next generation" which is inverted from the current generation. When
  the ring wraps, the current/next generation are swapped.

- It's the driver's responsibility to ensure that the RX and TX
  completion queues are not overrun. This can be accomplished by
  limiting the number of descriptors posted to HW.

- TX packets have a 16 bit completion_tag and RX buffers have a 16 bit
  buffer_id. These will be returned on the TX completion and RX queues
  respectively to let the driver know which packet/buffer was completed.

Bitfields are used to describe descriptor fields. This notation is more
concise and readable than shift-and-mask. It is possible because the
driver is restricted to little endian platforms.
