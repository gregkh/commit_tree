virtio_blk: cleanups: remove check obsoleted by CONFIG_LBDAF removal

Prior to 72deb455b5ec ("block: remove CONFIG_LBDAF"), it was optional if
the 32-bit kernel support block device and/or file sizes larger than 2 TiB
(considering the sector size is 512 bytes)
But now sector_t and blkcnt_t are always 64-bit in size.
