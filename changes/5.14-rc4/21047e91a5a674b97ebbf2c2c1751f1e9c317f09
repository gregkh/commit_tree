arm64: Check if GMID_EL1.BS is the same on all CPUs

The GMID_EL1.BS field determines the number of tags accessed by the
LDGM/STGM instructions (EL1 and up), used by the kernel for copying or
zeroing page tags.

Taint the kernel if GMID_EL1.BS differs between CPUs but only of
CONFIG_ARM64_MTE is enabled.
