ALSA: hda/realtek: Improve fixup for HP Spectre x360 15-df0xxx

On HP Spectre x360 15-df0xxx, after system boot with plugged headset, the
headset mic are not detected.
Moving pincfg and DAC's config to single fixup function fix this.

[ The actual bug in the original code was that it used a chain to
  ALC286_FIXUP_SPEAKER2_TO_DAC1, and it contains not only the DAC1
  route fix but also another chain to ALC269_FIXUP_THINKPAD_ACPI.
  I thought the latter one is harmless for non-Thinkpad, but it
  doesn't seem so; it contains again yet another chain to
  ALC269_FIXUP_SKI_IGNORE, and this might be bad for some machines,
  including this HP machine.  -- tiwai ]
