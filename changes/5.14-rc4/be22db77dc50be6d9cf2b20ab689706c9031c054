ALSA: usb-audio: Fix uninitialized variable at __uac_clock_find_source()

The cur variable indicating the currently selected clock source can be
theoretically used as uninitialized after the recent commit
481f17c41803 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Handle error for the current selector
gracefully").  For addressing it, initialize it before use.

Also, one place seems setting 0 to a wrong variable ret, instead of
cur; otherwise it makes little sense.  Since the initialization is
done beforehand, we can get rid of this line, too.
