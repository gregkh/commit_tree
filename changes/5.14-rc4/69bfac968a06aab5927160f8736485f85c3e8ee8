net: switchdev: add a context void pointer to struct switchdev_notifier_info

In the case where the driver asks for a replay of a certain type of
event (port object or attribute) for a bridge port that is a LAG, it may
do so because this port has just joined the LAG.

But there might already be other switchdev ports in that LAG, and it is
preferable that those preexisting switchdev ports do not act upon the
replayed event.

The solution is to add a context to switchdev events, which is NULL most
of the time (when the bridge layer initiates the call) but which can be
set to a value controlled by the switchdev driver when a replay is
requested. The driver can then check the context to figure out if all
ports within the LAG should act upon the switchdev event, or just the
ones that match the context.

We have to modify all switchdev_handle_* helper functions as well as the
prototypes in the drivers that use these helpers too, because these
helpers hide the underlying struct switchdev_notifier_info from us and
there is no way to retrieve the context otherwise.

The context structure will be populated and used in later patches.
