mips: ralink: convert to CONFIG_COMMON_CLK

ralink only has a very trivial clock implementation, with everything
being fixed clocks.

Convert it to CONFIG_COMMON_CLK to reduce the number of platforms
that rely on legacy clocks. Of course, the clocks really should
be read from the device tree instead, but this is a step into that
direction.

This adds about 50KB to the kernel image size, which is an unfortunate
increase, but not as bad as I had feared:
