tty: cumulate and document tty_struct::flow* members

Group the flow flags under a single struct called flow. The new struct
contains 'stopped' and 'tco_stopped' bools which used to be bits in a
bitfield. The struct also contains the lock protecting them to
potentially share the same cache line.

Note that commit c545b66c6922b (tty: Serialize tcflow() with other tty
flow control changes) added a padding to the original bitfield. It was
for the bitfield to occupy a whole 64b word to avoid interferring stores
on Alpha (cannot we evaporate this arch with weird implications to C
code yet?). But it doesn't work as expected as the padding
(tty_struct::unused) is aligned to a 8B boundary too and occupies some
bytes from the next word.

So make it reliable by:
1) setting __aligned of the struct -- that aligns the start, and
2) making 'unsigned long unused[0]' as the last member of the struct --
   pads the end.

This is also the perfect time to start the documentation of tty_struct
where all this lives. So we start by documenting what these bools
actually serve for. And why we do all the alignment dances. Only the few
up-to-date information from the Theodore's comment made it into this new
Kerneldoc comment.
