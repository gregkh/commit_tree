x86/kvm: fix vcpu-id indexed array sizes

KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID is the maximum vcpu-id of a guest, and not the number
of vcpu-ids. Fix array indexed by vcpu-id to have KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID+1
elements.

Note that this is currently no real problem, as KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID is
an odd number, resulting in always enough padding being available at
the end of those arrays.

Nevertheless this should be fixed in order to avoid rare problems in
case someone is using an even number for KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID.
