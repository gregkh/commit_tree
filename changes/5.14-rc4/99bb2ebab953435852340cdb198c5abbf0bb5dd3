net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: NET_DSA_MV88E6XXX_PTP should depend on NET_DSA_MV88E6XXX

Making global2 support mandatory removed the Kconfig symbol
NET_DSA_MV88E6XXX_GLOBAL2.  This symbol also served as an intermediate
symbol to make NET_DSA_MV88E6XXX_PTP depend on NET_DSA_MV88E6XXX.  With
the symbol removed, the user is always asked about PTP support for
Marvell 88E6xxx switches, even if the latter support is not enabled.

Fix this by reinstating the dependency.
