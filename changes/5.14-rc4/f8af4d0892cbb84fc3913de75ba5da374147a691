virtio_balloon: specify page reporting order if needed

The page reporting won't be triggered if the freeing page can't come up
with a free area, whose size is equal or bigger than the threshold (page
reporting order).  The default page reporting order, equal to
@pageblock_order, is too huge on some architectures to trigger page
reporting.  One example is ARM64 when 64KB base page size is used.

      PAGE_SIZE:          64KB
      pageblock_order:    13       (512MB)
      MAX_ORDER:          14

This specifies the page reporting order to 5 (2MB) for this specific case
so that page reporting can be triggered.
