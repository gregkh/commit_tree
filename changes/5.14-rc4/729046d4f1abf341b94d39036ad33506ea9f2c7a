arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: Update flash freq to match reality

This spi flash part is actually being clocked at 37.5MHz, not 25MHz,
because of the way the clk driver is rounding up the rate that is
requested to the nearest supported frequency. Let's update the frequency
here, and remove the TODO because this is the fastest frequency we're
going to be able to use here.
