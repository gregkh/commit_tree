arm64/mm: Rename ARM64_SWAPPER_USES_SECTION_MAPS

ARM64_SWAPPER_USES_SECTION_MAPS implies that a PMD level huge page mappings
are used for swapper, idmap and vmemmap. Lets make it PMD explicit removing
any possible confusion with generic memory sections and also bit generic as
it's applicable for idmap and vmemmap mappings as well. Hence rename it as
ARM64_KERNEL_USES_PMD_MAPS instead.
