pwm: Make of_pwm_xlate_with_flags() work with #pwm-cells = <2>

The two functions of_pwm_simple_xlate() and of_pwm_xlate_with_flags()
are quite similar. of_pwm_simple_xlate() only supports two-cell PWM
specifiers while of_pwm_xlate_with_flags() only supports PWM specifiers
with 3 or more cells. The latter can easily be modified to behave
identically to of_pwm_simple_xlate() for two-cell PWM specifiers. This
is implemented here and allows to drop of_pwm_simple_xlate() in the next
commit.

There is a small detail that is different now in the two-cell specifier
case in of_pwm_xlate_with_flags(): pwm->args.polarity is unconditionally
initialized to PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL in the latter. I didn't find a case
where this matters and doing that explicitly is the more robust
approach.
