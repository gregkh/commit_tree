fs: dlm: introduce proto values

Currently the dlm protocol values are that TCP is 0 and everything else
is SCTP. This makes it difficult to introduce possible other transport
layers. The only one user space tool dlm_controld, which I am aware of,
handles the protocol value 1 for SCTP. We change it now to handle SCTP
as 1, this will break user space API but it will fix it so we can add
possible other transport layers.
