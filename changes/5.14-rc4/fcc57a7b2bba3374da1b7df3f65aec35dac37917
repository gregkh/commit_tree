RDMA/core: Use refcount_t instead of atomic_t on refcount of iwpm_admin_data

The refcount_t API will WARN on underflow and overflow of a reference
counter, and avoid use-after-free risks. Increase refcount_t from 0 to 1 is
regarded as there is a risk about use-after-free. So it should be set to 1
directly during initialization.
