perf tools: Support pmu prefix for mem-load event

The perf_mem_events__name() can generate the mem-load event name.
It uses a variable 'mem_loads_name__init' to avoid generating the
event name every time (because perf_pmu__scan takes some time).

The perf_mem_events__name() assumes the pmu is "cpu" but it's not
correct for hybrid platform. For Alderlake, the pmu is "cpu_core" or
"cpu_atom"

Introduce a new parameter 'pmu_name' in perf_mem_events__name
to let the caller specify a pmu name.

Considering such event name is x86 specific, so move
perf_mem_events[] to arch/x86/util/mem-events.c.

We still keep the variable 'mem_loads_name__init' but it's only
used when pmu_name is NULL (compatible for original behavior). When
pmu_name is not NULL (e.g. "cpu_core"), this patch doesn't have
optimization. That can be implemented in follow up patch.
