crypto: qce - Make result dump optional

Qualcomm crypto engine allows for IV registers and status register
to be concatenated to the output. This option is enabled by setting the
RESULTS_DUMP field in GOPROC  register. This is useful for most of the
algorithms to either retrieve status of operation or in case of
authentication algorithms to retrieve the mac. But for ccm
algorithms, the mac is part of the output stream and not retrieved
from the IV registers, thus needing a separate buffer to retrieve it.
Make enabling RESULTS_DUMP field optional so that algorithms can choose
whether or not to enable the option.
Note that in this patch, the enabled algorithms always choose
RESULTS_DUMP to be enabled. But later with the introduction of ccm
algorithms, this changes.
