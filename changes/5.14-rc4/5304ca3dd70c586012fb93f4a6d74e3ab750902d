virtio-mem: simplify high-level unplug handling in Sub Block Mode

Let's simplify by introducing a new virtio_mem_sbm_unplug_any_sb(),
similar to virtio_mem_sbm_plug_any_sb(), to simplify high-level memory
block selection when unplugging in Sub Block Mode.

Rename existing virtio_mem_sbm_unplug_any_sb() to
virtio_mem_sbm_unplug_any_sb_raw().

The only change is that we now temporarily unlock the hotplug mutex around
cond_resched() when processing offline memory blocks, which doesn't
make a real difference as we already have to temporarily unlock in
virtio_mem_sbm_unplug_any_sb_offline() when removing a memory block.
