net: dsa: sja1105: parameterize the number of ports

The sja1105 driver will gain support for the next-gen SJA1110 switch,
which is very similar except for the fact it has more than 5 ports.

So we need to replace the hardcoded SJA1105_NUM_PORTS in this driver
with ds->num_ports. This patch is as mechanical as possible (save for
the fact that ds->num_ports is not an integer constant expression).
