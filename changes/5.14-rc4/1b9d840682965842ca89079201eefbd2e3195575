drm/i915/gt: replace gen use in intel_engine_cs

Start using the new fields graphics_version for the previous gen checks.
Here we rename the "gen" field and replace the comparisons using it to
start using the new GRAPHICS_VER(). Other uses of INTEL_GEN() were left
as is for automatic conversion later.
