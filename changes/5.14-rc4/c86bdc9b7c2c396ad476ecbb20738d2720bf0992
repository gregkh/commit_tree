btrfs: remove a stale comment for btrfs_decompress_bio()

Since commit 8140dc30a432 ("btrfs: btrfs_decompress_bio() could accept
compressed_bio instead"), btrfs_decompress_bio() accepts
"struct compressed_bio" other than open-coded parameter list.

Thus the comments for the parameter list is no longer needed.
