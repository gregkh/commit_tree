KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix CONFIG_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n crash

When running CPU_FTR_P9_TM_HV_ASSIST, HFSCR[TM] is set for the guest
even if the host has CONFIG_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n, which causes it to be
unprepared to handle guest exits while transactional.

Normal guests don't have a problem because the HTM capability will not
be advertised, but a rogue or buggy one could crash the host.
