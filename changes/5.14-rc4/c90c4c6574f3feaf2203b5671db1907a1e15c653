drm/i915: Reinstate the mmap ioctl for some platforms

Reinstate the mmap ioctl for all current integrated platforms.
The intention was really to have it disabled for discrete graphics
where we enforce a single mmap mode.

This was reported to break ADL-P with the media stack, which was not the
intention. Although longer term we do still plan to sunset this ioctl
even for integrated, in favour of using mmap_offset instead.
