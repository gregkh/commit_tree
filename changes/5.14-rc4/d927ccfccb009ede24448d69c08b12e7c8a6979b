f2fs: Prevent swap file in LFS mode

The kernel writes to swap files on f2fs directly without the assistance
of the filesystem. This direct write by kernel can be non-sequential
even when the f2fs is in LFS mode. Such non-sequential write conflicts
with the LFS semantics. Especially when f2fs is set up on zoned block
devices, the non-sequential write causes unaligned write command errors.

To avoid the non-sequential writes to swap files, prevent swap file
activation when the filesystem is in LFS mode.
