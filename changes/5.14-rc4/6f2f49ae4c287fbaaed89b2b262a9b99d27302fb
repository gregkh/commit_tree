media: venus: hfi_msgs.h: Replace one-element arrays with flexible-array members

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Use flexible-array members in struct hfi_msg_sys_property_info_pkt and
hfi_msg_session_property_info_pkt instead of one-element arrays, and
refactor the code accordingly.

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warnings:
