virtio/vsock: dequeue callback for SOCK_SEQPACKET

Callback fetches RW packets from rx queue of socket until whole record
is copied(if user's buffer is full, user is not woken up). This is done
to not stall sender, because if we wake up user and it leaves syscall,
nobody will send credit update for rest of record, and sender will wait
for next enter of read syscall at receiver's side. So if user buffer is
full, we just send credit update and drop data.
