dt-bindings: firmware: juno,scpi: Move to sram.yaml json schema

Commit a90b15e0ad72 ("Documentation: bindings: decouple juno specific
details from generic binding") moved the juno specific bindings into
separate file. Though there was no need for juno specific binding, it
has been used unfortunately for whatever stupid reason I added it for.

Let us move the same to the generic sram.yaml schema and remove the
old text format binding.
