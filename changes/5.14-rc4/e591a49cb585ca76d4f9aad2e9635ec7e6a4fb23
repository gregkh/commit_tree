habanalabs/gaudi: read GIC sts after FW is loaded

Reading of GIC privileged status will be done after F/W is loaded,
because privileged GIC capability is only available with the correct
ARMCP version, and after it's loaded.
Such versions necessarily support COMMS, so GIC alternatives (SP regs)
will be read directly from dynamic regs.

As well, initiation of DMA QMANs will occur after F/W is loaded
since it depends on GIC configuration.

In case F/W isn't loaded there's no problem since either way
there won't be any GIC IRQ handling.
