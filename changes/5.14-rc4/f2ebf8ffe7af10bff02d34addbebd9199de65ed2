perf trace: Free syscall->arg_fmt

ASan reports several memory leaks running:

  # perf test "88: Check open filename arg using perf trace + vfs_getname"

The second of these leaks is caused by the arg_fmt field of syscall not
being deallocated.

This patch adds a new function syscall__exit which is called on all
syscalls.table entries in trace__exit, which will free the arg_fmt
field.
