net: qualcomm: rmnet: IPv6 payload length is simple

We don't support any extension headers for IPv6 packets.  Extension
headers therefore contribute 0 bytes to the payload length.  As a
result we can just use the IPv6 payload length as the length used to
compute the pseudo header checksum for both UDP and TCP messages.
