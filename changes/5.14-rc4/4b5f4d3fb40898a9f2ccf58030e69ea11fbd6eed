RDMA: Split the alloc_hw_stats() ops to port and device variants

This is being used to implement both the port and device global stats,
which is causing some confusion in the drivers. For instance EFA and i40iw
both seem to be misusing the device stats.

Split it into two ops so drivers that don't support one or the other can
leave the op NULL'd, making the calling code a little simpler to
understand.
