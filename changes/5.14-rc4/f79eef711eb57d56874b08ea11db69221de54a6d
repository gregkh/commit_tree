ionic: catch no ptp support earlier

If PTP configuration is attempted on ports that don't support
it, such as VF ports, the driver will return an error status
-95, or EOPNOSUPP and print an error message
    enp98s0: hwstamp set failed: -95

Because some daemons can retry every few seconds, this can end
up filling the dmesg log and pushing out other more useful
messages.

We can catch this issue earlier in our handling and return
the error without a log message.
