HID: intel_ish-hid: HBM: Use connected standby state bit during suspend/resume

The individual sensor drivers implemented in the ISH firmware needs
capability to take special actions when there is a change in the system
standby state. The ISH core firmware passes this notification to
individual sensor drivers in response to the OS request via connected
standby bit in the SYSTEM_STATE_STATUS command.

This change sets CONNECTED_STANDBY_STATE_BIT bit to 1 during suspend
callback and clears during resume callback.
