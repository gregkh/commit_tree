bus: mhi: core: Validate channel ID when processing command completions

MHI reads the channel ID from the event ring element sent by the
device which can be any value between 0 and 255. In order to
prevent any out of bound accesses, add a check against the maximum
number of channels supported by the controller and those channels
not configured yet so as to skip processing of that event ring
element.
