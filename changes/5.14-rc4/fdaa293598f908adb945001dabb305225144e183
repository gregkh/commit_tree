KVM: x86/mmu: Get CR0.WP from MMU, not vCPU, in shadow page fault

Use the current MMU instead of vCPU state to query CR0.WP when handling
a page fault.  In the nested NPT case, the current CR0.WP reflects L2,
whereas the page fault is shadowing L1's NPT.  Practically speaking, this
is a nop a NPT walks are always user faults, but fix it up for
consistency.
