io_uring: don't block level reissue off completion path

Some setups, like SCSI, can throw spurious -EAGAIN off the softirq
completion path. Normally we expect this to happen inline as part
of submission, but apparently SCSI has a weird corner case where it
can happen as part of normal completions.

This should be solved by having the -EAGAIN bubble back up the stack
as part of submission, but previous attempts at this failed and we're
not just quite there yet. Instead we currently use REQ_F_REISSUE to
handle this case.

For now, catch it in io_rw_should_reissue() and prevent a reissue
from a bogus path.
