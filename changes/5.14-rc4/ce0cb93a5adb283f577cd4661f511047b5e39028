drm/rockchip: cdn-dp: fix sign extension on an int multiply for a u64 result

The variable bit_per_pix is a u8 and is promoted in the multiplication
to an int type and then sign extended to a u64. If the result of the
int multiplication is greater than 0x7fffffff then the upper 32 bits will
be set to 1 as a result of the sign extension. Avoid this by casting
tu_size_reg to u64 to avoid sign extension and also a potential overflow.
