btrfs: only clamp the first time we have to start flushing

We were clamping the threshold for preemptive reclaim any time we added
a ticket to wait on, which if we have a lot of threads means we'd
essentially max out the clamp the first time we start to flush.

Instead of doing this, simply do it every time we have to start
flushing, this will make us ramp up gradually instead of going to max
clamping as soon as we start needing to do flushing.
