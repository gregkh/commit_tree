libbpf: Restore errno return for functions that were already returning it

The update to streamline libbpf error reporting intended to change all
functions to return the errno as a negative return value if
LIBBPF_STRICT_DIRECT_ERRS is set. However, if the flag is *not* set, the
return value changes for the two functions that were already returning a
negative errno unconditionally: bpf_link__unpin() and perf_buffer__poll().

This is a user-visible API change that breaks applications; so let's revert
these two functions back to unconditionally returning a negative errno
value.
