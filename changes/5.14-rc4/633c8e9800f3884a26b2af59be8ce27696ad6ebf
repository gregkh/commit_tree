powerpc/pseries: Enable hardlockup watchdog for PowerVM partitions

PowerVM will not arbitrarily oversubscribe or stop guests, page out the
guest kernel text to a NFS volume connected by carrier pigeon to abacus
based storage, etc., as a KVM host might. So PowerVM guests are not
likely to be killed by the hard lockup watchdog in normal operation,
even with shared processor LPARs which still get a minimum allotment of
CPU time.

Enable the hard lockup detector by default on !KVM guests, which we will
assume is PowerVM. It has been useful in finding problems on bare metal
kernels.
