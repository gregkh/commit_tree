irqdomain: Reimplement irq_linear_revmap() with irq_find_mapping()

irq_linear_revmap() is supposed to be a fast path for domain
lookups, but it only exposes low-level details of the irqdomain
implementation, details which are better kept private.

The *overhead* between the two is only a function call and
a couple of tests, so it is likely that noone can show any
meaningful difference compared to the cost of taking an
interrupt.

Reimplement irq_linear_revmap() with irq_find_mapping()
in order to preserve source code compatibility, and
rename the internal field for a measure.
