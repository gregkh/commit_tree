mm: hugetlb: introduce CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE_FREE_VMEMMAP_DEFAULT_ON

When using HUGETLB_PAGE_FREE_VMEMMAP, the freeing unused vmemmap pages
associated with each HugeTLB page is default off.  Now the vmemmap is PMD
mapped.  So there is no side effect when this feature is enabled with no
HugeTLB pages in the system.  Someone may want to enable this feature in
the compiler time instead of using boot command line.  So add a config to
make it default on when someone do not want to enable it via command line.
