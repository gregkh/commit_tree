net: sched: fix memory leak in tcindex_partial_destroy_work

Syzbot reported memory leak in tcindex_set_parms(). The problem was in
non-freed perfect hash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work().

In tcindex_set_parms() new tcindex_data is allocated and some fields from
old one are copied to new one, but not the perfect hash. Since
tcindex_partial_destroy_work() is the destroy function for old
tcindex_data, we need to free perfect hash to avoid memory leak.
