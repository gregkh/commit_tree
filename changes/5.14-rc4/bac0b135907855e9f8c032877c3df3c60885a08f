KVM: selftests: change pthread_yield to sched_yield

With later GCC we get

 steal_time.c: In function ‘main’:
 steal_time.c:323:25: warning: ‘pthread_yield’ is deprecated: pthread_yield is deprecated, use sched_yield instead [-Wdeprecated-declarations]

Let's follow the instructions and use sched_yield instead.
