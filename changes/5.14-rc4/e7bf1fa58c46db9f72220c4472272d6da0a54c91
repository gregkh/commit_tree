regulator: bd9576: Support error reporting

BD9573 and BD9576 support set of "protection" interrupts for "fatal"
issues. Those lead to SOC reset as PMIC shuts the power outputs. Thus
there is no relevant IRQ handling for them.

Few "detection" interrupts were added to the BD9576 with the idea that
SOC could take some recovery-action before error gets unrecoverable.

Add support for over and under voltage detection for Vout1 ... Vout4
and VoutL1. Add over-current detection for VoutS1 and finally a
thermal warning (common for all regulators) which alerts 30 C
before temperature reaches the thermal shutdown point. This way
consumer drivers can build error-recovery mechanisms.

Unfortunately the BD9576 interrupt logic was not re-evaluated. IRQs
are not designed to be properly acknowleged - and IRQ line is kept
active for whole duration of error condition (in comparison to
informing only about state change).
