ima: Define new template fields iuid and igid

This patch defines the new template fields iuid and igid, which include
respectively the inode UID and GID. For idmapped mounts, still the original
UID and GID are provided.

These fields can be used to verify the EVM portable signature, if it was
included with the template fields sig or evmsig.
