platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Revert "add support for ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15"

The quirks added to asus-nb-wmi for the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 are
wrong, they tell the asus-wmi code to use the vendor specific WMI backlight
interface. But there is no such interface on these laptops.

As a side effect, these quirks stop the acpi_video driver to register since
they make acpi_video_get_backlight_type() return acpi_backlight_vendor,
leaving only the native AMD backlight driver in place, which is the one we
want. This happy coincidence is being replaced with a new quirk in
drivers/acpi/video_detect.c which actually sets the backlight_type to
acpi_backlight_native fixinf this properly. This reverts
commit 13bceda68fb9 ("platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: add support for ASUS ROG
Zephyrus G14 and G15").
