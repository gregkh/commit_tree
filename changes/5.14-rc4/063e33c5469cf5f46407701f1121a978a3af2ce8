drm/amdkfd: add xnack enabled flag to kfd_process

XNACK mode controls the SQ RETRY_DISABLE setting that determines,
whether recoverable page faults can be supported on GFXv9 hardware.
Only on Aldebaran we can support different processes running with
different XNACK modes. On older chips all processes must use the same
RETRY_DISABLE setting. However, processes not relying on recoverable
page faults can work with RETRY enabled. This means XNACK off is always
available as a fallback so we can use the same mode on all GPUs in a
process.
