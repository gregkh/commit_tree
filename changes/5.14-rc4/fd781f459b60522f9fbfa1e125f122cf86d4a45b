selinux: Remove redundant assignment to rc

Variable rc is set to '-EINVAL' but this value is never read as
it is overwritten or not used later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

security/selinux/ss/services.c:2103:3: warning: Value stored to 'rc' is
never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].

security/selinux/ss/services.c:2079:2: warning: Value stored to 'rc' is
never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].

security/selinux/ss/services.c:2071:2: warning: Value stored to 'rc' is

security/selinux/ss/policydb.c:2592:3: warning: Value stored to 'rc' is
