nvmet: change sn size and check validity

According to the NVM specification, the serial_number should be 20 bytes
(bytes 23:04 of the Identify Controller data structure), and should
contain only ASCII characters.

In accordance, the serial_number size is changed to 20 bytes and before
any attempt to store a new value in serial_number we check that the
input is valid - i.e. contains only ASCII characters, is not empty and
does not exceed 20 bytes.
