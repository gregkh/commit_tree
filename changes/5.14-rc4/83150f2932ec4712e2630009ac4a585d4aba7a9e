KVM: X86: Add functions that calculate the nested TSC fields

When L2 is entered we need to "merge" the TSC multiplier and TSC offset
values of 01 and 12 together.

The merging is done using the following equations:
  offset_02 = ((offset_01 * mult_12) >> shift_bits) + offset_12
  mult_02 = (mult_01 * mult_12) >> shift_bits

Where shift_bits is kvm_tsc_scaling_ratio_frac_bits.
