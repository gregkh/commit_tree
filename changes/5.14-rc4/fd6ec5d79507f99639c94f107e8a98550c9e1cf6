w1: ds2438: adding support for reading page1

Added a sysfs entry to support reading the page1 registers. This registers
contain Elapsed Time Meter (ETM) data, which shows for how long the chip is
on, as well as an Offset Register data, which can be used to calibrate the
current measurement of the chip.
