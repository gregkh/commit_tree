drm/msm/dpu: Drop unnecessary NULL checks after container_of in dpu_encoder

The result of container_of() operations is never NULL unless the embedded
element is the first element of the structure. This is not the case here.
The NULL checks on the result of container_of() are therefore unnecessary
and misleading. Remove them.

This change was made automatically with the following Coccinelle script.

@@
type t;
identifier v;
statement s;

<+...
(
  t v = container_of(...);
|
  v = container_of(...);
)
  ...
  when != v
- if (\( !v \| v == NULL \) ) s
...+>
