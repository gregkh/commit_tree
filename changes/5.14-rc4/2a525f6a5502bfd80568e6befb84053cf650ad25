perf inject: Add facility to do in place update

When there is a need to modify only timestamps, it is much simpler and
quicker to do it to the existing file rather than re-write all the
contents.

In preparation for that, add the ability to modify the input file in place.
In practice that just means making the file descriptor and mmaps writable.
