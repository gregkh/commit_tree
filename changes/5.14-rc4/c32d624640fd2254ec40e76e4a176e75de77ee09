Bluetooth: disable filter dup when scan for adv monitor

Disable duplicates filter when scanning for advertisement monitor for
the following reasons. The scanning includes active scan and passive
scan.

For HW pattern filtering (ex. MSFT), Realtek and Qualcomm controllers
ignore RSSI_Sampling_Period when the duplicates filter is enabled.

For SW pattern filtering, when we're not doing interleaved scanning, it
is necessary to disable duplicates filter, otherwise hosts can only
receive one advertisement and it's impossible to know if a peer is still
in range.
