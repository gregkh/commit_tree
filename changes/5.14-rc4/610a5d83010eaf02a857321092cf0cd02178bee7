clk: zynqmp: Use firmware specific common clock flags

Currently firmware passes CCF specific flags to ZynqMP clock driver.
So firmware needs to be updated if CCF flags are changed. The firmware
should have its own 'flag number space' that is distinct from the
common clk framework's 'flag number space'. So define and use ZynqMP
specific common clock flags instead of using CCF flags.
