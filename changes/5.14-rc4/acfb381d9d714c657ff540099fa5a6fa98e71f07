io_uring: simplify waking sqo_sq_wait

Going through submission in __io_sq_thread() and still having a full SQ
is rather unexpected, so remove a check for SQ fullness and just wake up
whoever wait on sqo_sq_wait. Also skip if it doesn't do submission in
the first place, likely may to happen for SQPOLL sharing and/or IOPOLL.
