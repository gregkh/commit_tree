Bluetooth: hci_qca: fix potential GPF

In qca_power_shutdown() qcadev local variable is
initialized by hu->serdev.dev private data, but
hu->serdev can be NULL and there is a check for it.

Since, qcadev is not used before

	if (!hu->serdev)
		return;

we can move its initialization after this "if" to
prevent GPF.
