arm64: tegra: Consolidate audio card names

The current scheme for audio card names is suboptimal because it causes
the automatically generated names (for ID and driver) to be truncated,
which in turn can cause conflicts.

Introduce a new scheme which reuses the board model for the names and
appends the "HDA" and "APE" suffixes for the HDA and APE, respectively.
As a side-effect these suffixes end up being used as the ID of the SoC
sound cards which makes it easy for users to select them when using the
ALSA command-line utilities, for example.

As a separate measure, the driver name for the cards is now set by the
corresponding audio driver (either tegra-hda or tegra-ape), making it a
more useful identifier than the currently normalized card name.
