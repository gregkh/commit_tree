soc: amlogic: meson-ee-pwrc: Rename "get_power" to "is_powered_off"

The name "get_power" is used within the Meson EE power controller driver
to indicate whether a power domain is turned on or off. With the
original "get_power" naming the result was:
- true = powered off
- false = powered on

Rename "get_power" to "is_powered_off" to make the naming consistent
with the third argument to pm_genpd_init. Also this naming is easier to
understand when reading the code without looking at the implementation
of "get_power".
