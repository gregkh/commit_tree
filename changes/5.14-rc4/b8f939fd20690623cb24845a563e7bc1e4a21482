iio: magn: rm3100: Fix alignment of buffer in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

Add __aligned(8) to ensure the buffer passed to
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() is suitable for the naturally
aligned timestamp that will be inserted.

Here an explicit structure is not used, because this buffer is used in
a non-trivial way for data repacking.
