cxl/acpi: Introduce the root of a cxl_port topology

While CXL builds upon the PCI software model for enumeration and
endpoint control, a static platform component is required to bootstrap
the CXL memory layout. Similar to how ACPI identifies root-level PCI
memory resources, ACPI data enumerates the address space and interleave
configuration for CXL Memory.

In addition to identifying host bridges, ACPI is responsible for
enumerating the CXL memory space that can be addressed by downstream
decoders. This is similar to the requirement for ACPI to publish
resources via the _CRS method for PCI host bridges. Specifically, ACPI
publishes a table, CXL Early Discovery Table (CEDT), which includes a
list of CXL Memory resources, CXL Fixed Memory Window Structures
(CFMWS).

For now, introduce the core infrastructure for a cxl_port hierarchy
starting with a root level anchor represented by the ACPI0017 device.

Follow on changes model support for the configurable decode capabilities
of cxl_port instances, i.e. CXL switch support.
