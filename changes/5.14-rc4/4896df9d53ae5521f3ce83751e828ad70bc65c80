selftests/sgx: remove checks for file execute permissions

The SGX selftests can fail for a bunch of non-obvious reasons
like 'noexec' permissions on /dev (which is the default *EVERYWHERE*
it seems).

A new test mistakenly also looked for +x permission on the
/dev/sgx_enclave.  File execute permissions really only apply to
the ability of execve() to work on a file, *NOT* on the ability
for an application to map the file with PROT_EXEC.  SGX needs to
mmap(PROT_EXEC), but doesn't need to execve() the device file.

Remove the check.
