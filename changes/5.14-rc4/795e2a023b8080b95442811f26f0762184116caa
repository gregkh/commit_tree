selftests/x86/syscall: Add tests under ptrace to syscall_numbering_64

Add tests running under ptrace for syscall_numbering_64. ptrace stopping on
syscall entry and possibly modifying the syscall number (regs.orig_rax) or
the default return value (regs.rax) can have different results than the
normal system call path.
