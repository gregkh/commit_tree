drm/amdgpu: Fix resource leak on probe error path

This reverts commit 4192f7b5768912ceda82be2f83c87ea7181f9980.

It is not true (as stated in the reverted commit changelog) that we never
unmap the BAR on failure; it actually does happen properly on
amdgpu_driver_load_kms() -> amdgpu_driver_unload_kms() ->
amdgpu_device_fini() error path.

What's worse, this commit actually completely breaks resource freeing on
probe failure (like e.g. failure to load microcode), as
amdgpu_driver_unload_kms() notices adev->rmmio being NULL and bails too
early, leaving all the resources that'd normally be freed in
amdgpu_acpi_fini() and amdgpu_device_fini() still hanging around, leading
to all sorts of oopses when someone tries to, for example, access the
sysfs and procfs resources which are still around while the driver is
gone.
