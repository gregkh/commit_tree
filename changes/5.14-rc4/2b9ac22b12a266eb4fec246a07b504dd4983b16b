loop: Fix missing discard support when using LOOP_CONFIGURE

Without calling loop_config_discard() the discard flag and parameters
aren't set/updated for the loop device and worst-case they could
indicate discard support when it isn't the case (ex: if the
LOOP_SET_STATUS ioctl was used with a different file prior to
LOOP_CONFIGURE).
