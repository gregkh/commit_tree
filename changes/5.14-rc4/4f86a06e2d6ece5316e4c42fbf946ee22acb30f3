irqdomain: Make normal and nomap irqdomains exclusive

Direct mappings are completely exclusive of normal mappings, meaning
that we can refactor the code slightly so that we can get rid of
the revmap_direct_max_irq field and use the revmap_size field
instead, reducing the size of the irqdomain structure.
