net: hns3: change the method of obtaining default ptp cycle

The ptp cycle is related to the hardware, so it may cause compatibility
issues if a fixed value is used in driver. Therefore, the method of
obtaining this value is changed to read from the register rather than
use a fixed value in driver.
