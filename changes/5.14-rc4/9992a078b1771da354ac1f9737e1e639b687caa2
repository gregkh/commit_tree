net: ip_tunnel: fix mtu calculation for ETHER tunnel devices

Commit 28e104d00281 ("net: ip_tunnel: fix mtu calculation") removed
dev->hard_header_len subtraction when calculate MTU for tunnel devices
as there is an overhead for device that has header_ops.

But there are ETHER tunnel devices, like gre_tap or erspan, which don't
have header_ops but set dev->hard_header_len during setup. This makes
pkts greater than (MTU - ETH_HLEN) could not be xmited. Fix it by
subtracting the ETHER tunnel devices' dev->hard_header_len for MTU
calculation.
