drm/msm/dpu: remove unused dpu_hw_blk features

Remove all unused dpu_hw_blk features and functions:
- dpu_hw_blk_get()/_put() and respective refcounting,
- global list of all dpu_hw_blk instances,
- dpu_hw_blk_ops and empty implementation inside each hw_blk subdriver.

This leaves dpu_hw_blk as a placeholder with just type and index.
