scsi: ufs-mediatek: Create reset control device_link

Mediatek UFS reset function relies on Reset Control provided by
reset-ti-syscon. To make Mediatek Reset Control work properly, select
reset-ti-syscon to ensure it is being built.

In addition, establish device_link to wait until reset-ti-syscon
initialization is complete during UFS probing.
