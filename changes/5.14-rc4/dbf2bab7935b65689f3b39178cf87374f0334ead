jbd2: simplify journal_clean_one_cp_list()

Now that __try_to_free_cp_buf() remove checkpointed buffer or transaction
when the buffer is not 'busy', which is only called by
journal_clean_one_cp_list(). This patch simplify this function by remove
__try_to_free_cp_buf() and invoke __cp_buffer_busy() directly.
