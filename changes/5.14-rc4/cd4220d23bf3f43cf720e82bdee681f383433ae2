KVM: selftests: do not require 64GB in set_memory_region_test

Unless the user sets overcommit_memory or has plenty of swap, the latest
changes to the testcase will result in ENOMEM failures for hosts with
less than 64GB RAM. As we do not use much of the allocated memory, we
can use MAP_NORESERVE to avoid this error.
