net/qla3xxx: fix schedule while atomic in ql_wait_for_drvr_lock and ql_adapter_reset

When calling the 'ql_wait_for_drvr_lock' and 'ql_adapter_reset', the driver
has already acquired the spin lock, so the driver should not call 'ssleep'
in atomic context.

This bug can be fixed by using 'mdelay' instead of 'ssleep'.
