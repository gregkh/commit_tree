ALSA: firewire-lib: transfer rx packets on-the-fly when replaying

Models in below series start transmission of packet after receiving the
sequence of packets:

 * Digidesign Digi00x family
 * RME Fireface series

Additionally, models in Tascam FireWire series start multiplexing PCM
frames into packets enough after receiving packets. It's required to
transfer packets on-the-fly for the above models according to nominal
sampling transfer frequency before starting sequence replay.

This commit allows drivers to decide whether the engine transfers packet
on-the-fly or not.
