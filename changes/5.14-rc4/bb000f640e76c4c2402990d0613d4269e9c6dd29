KVM: s390: restore old debugfs names

commit bc9e9e672df9 ("KVM: debugfs: Reuse binary stats descriptors")
did replace the old definitions with the binary ones. While doing that
it missed that some files are names different than the counters. This
is especially important for kvm_stat which does have special handling
for counters named instruction_*.
