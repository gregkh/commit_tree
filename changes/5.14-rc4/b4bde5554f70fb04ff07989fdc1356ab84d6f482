drm/i915/display: split DISPLAY_VER 9 and 10 in intel_setup_outputs()

Commit 5a9d38b20a5a ("drm/i915/display: hide workaround for broken vbt
in intel_bios.c") moved the workaround for broken or missing VBT to
intel_bios.c. However is_port_valid() only protects the handling of
different skus of the same display version. Since in
intel_setup_outputs() we share the code path with version 9, this would
also create port F for SKL/KBL, which does not exist.

Missing VBT can be reproduced when starting a headless QEMU with no
opregion available.

Avoid the issue by splitting versions 9 and 10 in intel_setup_outputs(),
which also makes it more clear what code path it's taking for each
version.

v2: move generic display version after Geminilake since that one has
a different set of outputs
