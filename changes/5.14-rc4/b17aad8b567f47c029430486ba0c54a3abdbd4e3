staging: rtl8188eu: remove RT_TRACE and DBG_88E prints from rtw_cmd.c

The rtl8188eu driver implements driver-specific debug prints which use
their own definitions for debug levels. By default, these prints are
disabled. You'd have to modify the code or set a module parameter to
enable them.

The rtl8723bs staging driver has already removed those prints. We should
do the same. Let's start with removing RT_TRACE and DBG_88E prints from
rtw_cmd.c.
