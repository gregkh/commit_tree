ima: Introduce template field evmsig and write to field sig as fallback

With the patch to accept EVM portable signatures when the
appraise_type=imasig requirement is specified in the policy, appraisal can
be successfully done even if the file does not have an IMA signature.

However, remote attestation would not see that a different signature type
was used, as only IMA signatures can be included in the measurement list.
This patch solves the issue by introducing the new template field 'evmsig'
to show EVM portable signatures and by including its value in the existing
field 'sig' if the IMA signature is not found.
