nvme-tcp-offload: Add device scan implementation

As part of create_ctrl(), it scans the registered devices and calls
the claim_dev op on each of them, to find the first devices that matches
the connection params. Once the correct devices is found (claim_dev
returns true), we raise the refcnt of that device and return that device
as the device to be used for ctrl currently being created.
