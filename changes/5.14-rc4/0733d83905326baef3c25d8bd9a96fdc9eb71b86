firmware: replace HOTPLUG with UEVENT in FW_ACTION defines

With commit 312c004d36ce ("[PATCH] driver core: replace "hotplug" by
"uevent"") already in the tree over a decade, update the name of
FW_ACTION defines to follow semantics, and reflect what the defines are
really meant for, i.e. whether or not generate user space event.
