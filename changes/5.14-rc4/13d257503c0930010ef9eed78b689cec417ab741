reiserfs: check directory items on read from disk

While verifying the leaf item that we read from the disk, reiserfs
doesn't check the directory items, this could cause a crash when we
read a directory item from the disk that has an invalid deh_location.

This patch adds a check to the directory items read from the disk that
does a bounds check on deh_location for the directory entries. Any
directory entry header with a directory entry offset greater than the
item length is considered invalid.
