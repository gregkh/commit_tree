staging: rtl8188eu: use standard kthread handling

The driver defines its own completion to wait until the command thread
is stopped. Use kthread_stop instead and check kthread_should_stop in
the thread's main loop. (For now, we keep the driver's "emergency exit"
via bDriverStopped/bSurpriseRemoved.)

To check if the command thread is running, the driver stores the thread's
task_struct and a boolean status variable. Remove this status and check the
task_struct directly.
