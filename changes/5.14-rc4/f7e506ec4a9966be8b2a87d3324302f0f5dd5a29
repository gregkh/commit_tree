platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix possible mem-leaks on tlmi_analyze() error-exit

Fix 2 possible memleaks on error-exits from tlmi_analyze():

1. If the kzalloc of pwd_power fails, then not only free the atributes,
   but also the allocated pwd_admin struct.

2. Freeing the attributes should also free the possible_values strings.
