ALSA: bebob: correct device entry for Mackie D.2 FireWire option card

For Mackie D.2 FireWire option card, 0x00000f is used for the value of
immediate entry for vendor in unit directory. The value comes from report
by FFADO user in below page:

 * http://subversion.ffado.org/wiki/AvcModels/MackieD.2.

However, it seems to be wrong. There are two causes; vendor's mistake to
decide value for GUID field in configuration ROM against standard, as
Stefan Richter mentioned in below post:

Another is implementation of libffado. The library doesn't print out the
value from immediate entry for vendor in unit directory. It just print out
the first 6 bytes of GUID as vendor ID.

This commit replaces with correct vendor OUI.
