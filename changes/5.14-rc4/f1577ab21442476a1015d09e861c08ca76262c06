KVM: SVM: svm_set_vintr don't warn if AVIC is active but is about to be deactivated

It is possible for AVIC inhibit and AVIC active state to be mismatched.
Currently we disable AVIC right away on vCPU which started the AVIC inhibit
request thus this warning doesn't trigger but at least in theory,
if svm_set_vintr is called at the same time on multiple vCPUs,
the warning can happen.
