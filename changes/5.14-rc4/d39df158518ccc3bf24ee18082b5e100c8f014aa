scsi: iscsi: Have abort handler get ref to conn

If SCSI midlayer is aborting a task when we are tearing down the conn we
could free the conn while the abort thread is accessing the conn. This has
the abort handler get a ref to the conn so it won't be freed from under it.

Note: this is not needed for device/target reset because we are holding the
eh_mutex when accessing the conn.
