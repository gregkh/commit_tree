octeontx2-af: Fix PKIND overlap between LBK and LMAC interfaces

Currently PKINDs are not assigned to LBK channels.
The default value of LBK_CHX_PKIND (channel to PKIND mapping) register
is zero, which is resulting in a overlap of pkind between LBK and CGX
LMACs. When KPU1 parser config is modified when PTP timestamping is
enabled on the CGX LMAC interface it is impacting traffic on LBK
interfaces as well.

This patch fixes the issue by reserving the PKIND#0 for LBK devices.
CGX mapped PF pkind starts from 1 and also fixes the max pkind available.
