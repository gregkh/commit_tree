bpf, sockmap: Zap ingress queues after stopping strparser

We don't want strparser to run and pass skbs into skmsg handlers when
the psock is null. We just sk_drop them in this case. When removing
a live socket from map it means extra drops that we do not need to
incur. Move the zap below strparser close to avoid this condition.

This way we stop the stream parser first stopping it from processing
packets and then delete the psock.
