netfilter: flowtable: Set offload timeouts according to proto values

Currently the aging period for tcp/udp connections is hard coded to
30 seconds. Aged tcp/udp connections configure a hard coded 120/30
seconds pickup timeout for conntrack.
This configuration may be too aggressive or permissive for some users.

Dynamically configure the nf flow table GC timeout intervals according
to the user defined values.
