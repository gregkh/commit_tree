f2fs: logging neatening

Update the logging uses that have unnecessary newlines as the f2fs_printk
function and so its f2fs_<level> macro callers already adds one.

This allows searching single line logging entries with an easier grep and
also avoids unnecessary blank lines in the logging.

Miscellanea:

o Coalesce formats
o Align to open parenthesis
