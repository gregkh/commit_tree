ALSA: hda: generic: Remove redundant assignment to dac

Variable dac is set to zero, but this value is never read as it is
overwritten or not used later on, hence it is a redundant assignment
and can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

sound/pci/hda/hda_generic.c:1436:4: warning: Value stored to 'dac' is
never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
