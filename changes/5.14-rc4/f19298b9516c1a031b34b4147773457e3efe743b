mm/vmstat: convert NUMA statistics to basic NUMA counters

NUMA statistics are maintained on the zone level for hits, misses, foreign
etc but nothing relies on them being perfectly accurate for functional
correctness.  The counters are used by userspace to get a general overview
of a workloads NUMA behaviour but the page allocator incurs a high cost to
maintain perfect accuracy similar to what is required for a vmstat like
NR_FREE_PAGES.  There even is a sysctl vm.numa_stat to allow userspace to
turn off the collection of NUMA statistics like NUMA_HIT.

This patch converts NUMA_HIT and friends to be NUMA events with similar
accuracy to VM events.  There is a possibility that slight errors will be
introduced but the overall trend as seen by userspace will be similar.
The counters are no longer updated from vmstat_refresh context as it is
unnecessary overhead for counters that may never be read by userspace.
Note that counters could be maintained at the node level to save space but
it would have a user-visible impact due to /proc/zoneinfo.
