tick/nohz: Only wake up a single target cpu when kicking a task

When adding a tick dependency to a task, its necessary to
wake up the CPU where the task resides to reevaluate tick
dependencies on that CPU.

However the current code wakes up all nohz_full CPUs, which
is unnecessary.

Switch to waking up a single CPU, by using ordering of writes
to task->cpu and task->tick_dep_mask.
