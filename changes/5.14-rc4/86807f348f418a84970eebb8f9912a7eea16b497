s390/mem_detect: fix diag260() program check new psw handling

The __diag260() inline asm temporarily changes the program check new
psw to redirect a potential program check on the diag instruction.
Restoring of the program check new psw is done in C code behind the
inline asm.

This can be problematic, especially if the function is inlined, since
the compiler can reorder instructions in such a way that a different
instruction, which may result in a program check, might be executed
before the program check new psw has been restored.

To avoid such a scenario move restoring into the inline asm. For
consistency reasons move also saving of the original program check new
psw into the inline asm.
