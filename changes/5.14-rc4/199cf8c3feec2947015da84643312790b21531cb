cxl/pci.c: Add a 'label_storage_size' attribute to the memdev

The 'Identify Device' mailbox command returns an 'lsa_size', which is
the size of the label storage area on the device. Export it as a sysfs
attribute so that userspace tooling to read/write the LSA can determine
the size without having to run an 'Identify Device' on their own.
