KVM: SVM: delay svm_vcpu_init_msrpm after svm->vmcb is initialized

Right now, svm_hv_vmcb_dirty_nested_enlightenments has an incorrect
dereference of vmcb->control.reserved_sw before the vmcb is checked
for being non-NULL.  The compiler is usually sinking the dereference
after the check; instead of doing this ourselves in the source,
ensure that svm_hv_vmcb_dirty_nested_enlightenments is only called
with a non-NULL VMCB.
