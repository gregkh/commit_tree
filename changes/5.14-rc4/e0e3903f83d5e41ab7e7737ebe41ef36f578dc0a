arm64: mm: decode xFSC in mem_abort_decode()

It would be helpful if mem_abort_decode() could decode the DFSC/IFSC, as
this can make it easier to identify common bugs (e.g. accesses which
trigger alignment faults) without having to manually decode the xFSC
value.

Decode the xFSC in mem_abort_decode().
