hugetlbfs: fix mount mode command line processing

In commit 32021982a324 ("hugetlbfs: Convert to fs_context") processing
of the mount mode string was changed from match_octal() to fsparam_u32.

This changed existing behavior as match_octal does not require octal
values to have a '0' prefix, but fsparam_u32 does.

Use fsparam_u32oct which provides the same behavior as match_octal.
