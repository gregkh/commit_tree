xfs: remove need_start_rec parameter from xlog_write()

The CIL push is the only call to xlog_write that sets this variable
to true. The other callers don't need a start rec, and they tell
xlog_write what to do by passing the type of ophdr they need written
in the flags field. The need_start_rec parameter essentially tells
xlog_write to to write an extra ophdr with a XLOG_START_TRANS type,
so get rid of the variable to do this and pass XLOG_START_TRANS as
the flag value into xlog_write() from the CIL push.
