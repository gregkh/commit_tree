media: i2c: max9271: Introduce wake_up() function

The MAX9271 chip manual prescribes a delay of 5 milliseconds
after the chip exits from low power state.

Add a new function to the max9271 library driver that wakes up the chip
with a dummy i2c transaction and implements the correct delay of 5
milliseconds after the chip exits from low power state.

Use the newly introduced function in the rdacm20 and rdacm21 camera
drivers. The former was not respecting the required delay while the
latter was waiting for a too-short timeout.
