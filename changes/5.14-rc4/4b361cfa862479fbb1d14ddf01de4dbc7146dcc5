mtd: core: add OTP nvmem provider support

Flash OTP regions can already be read via user space. Some boards have
their serial number or MAC addresses stored in the OTP regions. Add
support for them being a (read-only) nvmem provider.

The API to read the OTP data is already in place. It distinguishes
between factory and user OTP, thus there are up to two different
providers.
