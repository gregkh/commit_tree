rcu: Create an unrcu_pointer() to remove __rcu from a pointer

The xchg() and cmpxchg() functions are sometimes used to carry out RCU
updates.  Unfortunately, this can result in sparse warnings for both
the old-value and new-value arguments, as well as for the return value.
The arguments can be dealt with using RCU_INITIALIZER():

	old_p = xchg(&p, RCU_INITIALIZER(new_p));

But a sparse warning still remains due to assigning the __rcu pointer
returned from xchg to the (most likely) non-__rcu pointer old_p.

This commit therefore provides an unrcu_pointer() macro that strips
the __rcu.  This macro can be used as follows:

	old_p = unrcu_pointer(xchg(&p, RCU_INITIALIZER(new_p)));
