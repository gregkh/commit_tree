crypto: cavium/nitrox - Remove redundant initialization of 'sg'

Pointer 'sg' is being initialized however this value is never
read as 'sg' is assigned a same value in for_each_sg().
Remove the redundant assignment.

Cleans up clang warning:

drivers/crypto/cavium/nitrox/nitrox_reqmgr.c:161:22: warning: Value
stored to 'sg' during its initialization is never read
