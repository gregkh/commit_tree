iommu/iova: Put free_iova_mem() outside of spinlock iova_rbtree_lock

It is not necessary to put free_iova_mem() inside of spinlock/unlock
iova_rbtree_lock which only leads to more completion for the spinlock.
It has a small promote on the performance after the change. And also
rename private_free_iova() as remove_iova() because the function will not
free iova after that change.
