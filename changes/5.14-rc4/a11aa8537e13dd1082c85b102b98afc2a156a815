ALSA: usx2y: Avoid self-killing

The initialization os usx2y driver is multi-staged, and the PCM and
other device creations are done after the DSP is loaded and
initialized.  Upon the initialization, when an error happens, the
driver tries to call snd_card_free().  But this is dangerous, and in
general, the driver cannot kill itself during its operation.
Hence better to drop the snd_card_free() call from there.
