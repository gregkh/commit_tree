iio: accel: bmc150: Move struct bmc150_accel_data definition to bmc150-accel.h

Further patches to bmc150-accel-i2c.c need to store some extra info
(on top of the second_dev pointer) in the bmc150_accel_data struct,
rather then adding yet more accessor functions for this lets just
move the struct bmc150_accel_data definition to bmc150-accel.h.
