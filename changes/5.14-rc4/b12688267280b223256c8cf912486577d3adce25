libbpf: Change the order of data and text relocations.

In order to be able to generate loader program in the later
patches change the order of data and text relocations.
Also improve the test to include data relos.

If the kernel supports "FD array" the map_fd relocations can be processed
before text relos since generated loader program won't need to manually
patch ld_imm64 insns with map_fd.
But ksym and kfunc relocations can only be processed after all calls
are relocated, since loader program will consist of a sequence
of calls to bpf_btf_find_by_name_kind() followed by patching of btf_id
and btf_obj_fd into corresponding ld_imm64 insns. The locations of those
ld_imm64 insns are specified in relocations.
Hence process all data relocations (maps, ksym, kfunc) together after call relos.
