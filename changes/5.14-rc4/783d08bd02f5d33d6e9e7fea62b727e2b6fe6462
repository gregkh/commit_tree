Revert "clk: divider: Switch from .round_rate to .determine_rate by default"

This reverts commit db400ac1444b756030249ed4a35e53a68e557b59. We have
drivers that are still using the .round_rate ops from here. We could
implement both determine_rate and round_rate for these divider ops, but
for now let's just kick out the commit that tried to change it and
convert various drivers properly.
