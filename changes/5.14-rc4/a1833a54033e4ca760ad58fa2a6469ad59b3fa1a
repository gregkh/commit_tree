smpboot: fix duplicate and misplaced inlining directive

gcc doesn't care, but clang quite reasonably pointed out that the recent
commit e9ba16e68cce ("smpboot: Mark idle_init() as __always_inlined to
work around aggressive compiler un-inlining") did some really odd
things:

    kernel/smpboot.c:50:20: warning: duplicate 'inline' declaration specifier [-Wduplicate-decl-specifier]
    static inline void __always_inline idle_init(unsigned int cpu)
                       ^

which not only has that duplicate inlining specifier, but the new
__always_inline was put in the wrong place of the function definition.

We put the storage class specifiers (ie things like "static" and
"extern") first, and the type information after that.  And while the
compiler may not care, we put the inline specifier before the types.

So it should be just

    static __always_inline void idle_init(unsigned int cpu)

instead.
