io_uring: clean up check_overflow flag

There are no users of ->sq_check_overflow, only ->cq_check_overflow is
used. Combine it and move out of completion related part of struct
io_ring_ctx.

A not so obvious benefit of it is fitting all completion side fields
into a single cacheline. It was taking 2 lines before with 56B padding,
and io_cqring_ev_posted*() were still touching both of them.
