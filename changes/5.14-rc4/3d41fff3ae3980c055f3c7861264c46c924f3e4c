clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Drop unnecessary restore

The device is not losing context on CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ERROR. As we are only
saving and restoring context with cpu_pm, there is no need to restore the
context in case of an error.

Note that the unnecessary restoring of context does not cause issues, it's
just not needed.
