HID: apple: Add support for Keychron K1 wireless keyboard

The Keychron K1 wireless keyboard has a set of Apple-like function keys
and an Fn key that works like on an Apple bluetooth keyboard. It
identifies as an Apple Alu RevB ANSI keyboard (05ac:024f) over USB and
BT. Use hid-apple for it so the Fn key and function keys work correctly.
