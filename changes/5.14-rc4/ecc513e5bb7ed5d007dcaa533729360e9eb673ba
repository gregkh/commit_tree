KVM: x86: Drop "pre_" from enter/leave_smm() helpers

Now that .post_leave_smm() is gone, drop "pre_" from the remaining
helpers.  The helpers aren't invoked purely before SMI/RSM processing,
e.g. both helpers are invoked after state is snapshotted (from regs or
SMRAM), and the RSM helper is invoked after some amount of register state
has been stuffed.
