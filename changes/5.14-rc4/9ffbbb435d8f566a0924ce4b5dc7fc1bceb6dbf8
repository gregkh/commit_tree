block: introduce BIO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED bio flag

Introduce the BIO flag BIO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED to indicate that a BIO owns
the write lock of the zone it is targeting. This is the counterpart of
the struct request flag RQF_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED.

This new BIO flag is reserved for now for zone write locking control
for device mapper targets exposing a zoned block device. Since in this
case, the lock flag must not be propagated to the struct request that
will be used to process the BIO, a BIO private flag is used rather than
changing the RQF_ZONE_WRITE_LOCKED request flag into a common REQ_XXX
flag that could be used for both BIO and request. This avoids conflicts
down the stack with the block IO scheduler zone write locking
(in mq-deadline).
