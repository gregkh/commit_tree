KVM: arm64: vgic: Let an interrupt controller advertise lack of HW deactivation

The vGIC, as architected by ARM, allows a virtual interrupt to
trigger the deactivation of a physical interrupt. This allows
the following interrupt to be delivered without requiring an exit.

However, some implementations have choosen not to implement this,
meaning that we will need some unsavoury workarounds to deal with this.

On detecting such a case, taint the kernel and spit a nastygram.
We'll deal with this in later patches.
