platform/x86: amd-pmc: Fix SMU firmware reporting mechanism

It was lately understood that the current mechanism available in the
driver to get SMU firmware info works only on internal SMU builds and
there is a separate way to get all the SMU logging counters (addressed
in the next patch). Hence remove all the smu info shown via debugfs as it
is no more useful.
