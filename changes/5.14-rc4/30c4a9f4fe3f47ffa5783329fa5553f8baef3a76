nfp: flower-ct: implement action_merge check

Fill in code stub to check that the flow actions are valid for
merge. The actions of the flow X should not conflict with the
matches of flow X+1. For now this check is quite strict and
set_actions are very limited, will need to update this when
NAT support is added.
