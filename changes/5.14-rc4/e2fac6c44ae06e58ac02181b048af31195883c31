scsi: mpt3sas: Fix deadlock while cancelling the running firmware event

Do not cancel current running firmware event work if the event type is
different from MPT3SAS_REMOVE_UNRESPONDING_DEVICES.  Otherwise a deadlock
can be observed while cancelling the current firmware event work if a hard
reset operation is called as part of processing the current event.
