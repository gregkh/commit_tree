octeontx2-pf: Fix interface down flag on error

In the existing code while changing the number of TX/RX
queues using ethtool the PF/VF interface resources are
freed and reallocated (otx2_stop and otx2_open is called)
if the device is in running state. If any resource allocation
fails in otx2_open, driver free already allocated resources
and return. But again, when the number of queues changes
as the device state still running oxt2_stop is called.
In which we try to free already freed resources leading
to driver crash.
This patch fixes the issue by setting the INTF_DOWN flag on
error and free the resources in otx2_stop only if the flag is
not set.
