tty: cumulate and document tty_struct::ctrl* members

Group the ctrl members under a single struct called ctrl. The new struct
contains 'pgrp', 'session', 'pktstatus', and 'packet'. 'pktstatus' and
'packet' used to be bits in a bitfield. The struct also contains the
lock protecting them to share the same cache line.

Note that commit c545b66c6922b (tty: Serialize tcflow() with other tty
flow control changes) added a padding to the original bitfield. It was
for the bitfield to occupy a whole 64b word to avoid interferring stores
on Alpha (cannot we evaporate this arch with weird implications to C
code yet?). But it doesn't work as expected as the padding
(tty_struct::ctrl_unused) is aligned to a 8B boundary too and occupies
some bytes from the next word.

So make it reliable by:
1) setting __aligned of the struct -- that aligns the start, and
2) making 'unsigned long unused[0]' as the last member of the struct --
   pads the end.

Add a kerneldoc comment for this grouped members.
