hfs: add missing clean-up in hfs_fill_super

Patch series "hfs: fix various errors", v2.

This series ultimately aims to address a lockdep warning in
hfs_find_init reported by Syzbot [1].

The work done for this led to the discovery of another bug, and the
Syzkaller repro test also reveals an invalid memory access error after
clearing the lockdep warning.  Hence, this series is broken up into
three patches:

1. Add a missing call to hfs_find_exit for an error path in
   hfs_fill_super

2. Fix memory mapping in hfs_bnode_read by fixing calls to kmap

3. Add lock nesting notation to tell lockdep that the observed locking
   hierarchy is safe

This patch (of 3):

Before exiting hfs_fill_super, the struct hfs_find_data used in
hfs_find_init should be passed to hfs_find_exit to be cleaned up, and to
release the lock held on the btree.

The call to hfs_find_exit is missing from an error path.  We add it back
in by consolidating calls to hfs_find_exit for error paths.
