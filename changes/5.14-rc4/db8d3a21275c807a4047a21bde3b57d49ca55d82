HID: ft260: fix device removal due to USB disconnect

This commit fixes a functional regression introduced by the commit 82f09a637dd3
("HID: ft260: improve error handling of ft260_hid_feature_report_get()")
when upon USB disconnect, the FTDI FT260 i2c device is still available within
the /dev folder.

In my company's product, where the host USB to FT260 USB connection is
hard-wired in the PCB, the issue is not reproducible. To reproduce it, I used
the VirtualBox Ubuntu 20.04 VM and the UMFT260EV1A development module for the
FTDI FT260 chip:

Plug the UMFT260EV1A module into a USB port and attach it to VM.

The VM shows 2 i2c devices under the /dev:
    michael@michael-VirtualBox:~$ ls /dev/i2c-*
    /dev/i2c-0  /dev/i2c-1

The i2c-0 is not related to the FTDI FT260:
    michael@michael-VirtualBox:~$ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/name
    SMBus PIIX4 adapter at 4100

The i2c-1 is created by hid-ft260.ko:
    michael@michael-VirtualBox:~$ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-1/name
    FT260 usb-i2c bridge on hidraw1

Now, detach the FTDI FT260 USB device from VM. We expect the /dev/i2c-1
to disappear, but it's still here:
    michael@michael-VirtualBox:~$ ls /dev/i2c-*
    /dev/i2c-0  /dev/i2c-1

And the kernel log shows:
    [  +0.001202] usb 2-2: USB disconnect, device number 3
    [  +0.000109] ft260 0003:0403:6030.0002: failed to retrieve system status
    [  +0.000316] ft260 0003:0403:6030.0003: failed to retrieve system status

It happens because the commit 82f09a637dd3 changed the ft260_get_system_config()
return logic. This caused the ft260_is_interface_enabled() to exit with error
upon the FT260 device USB disconnect, which in turn, aborted the ft260_remove()
before deleting the FT260 i2c device and cleaning its sysfs stuff.

This commit restores the FT260 USB removal functionality and improves the
ft260_is_interface_enabled() code to handle correctly all chip modes defined
by the device interface configuration pins DCNF0 and DCNF1.
