pwm: imx1: Don't disable clocks at device remove time

The .remove() callback disables clocks that were not enabled in
.probe(). So just probing and then unbinding the driver results in a clk
enable imbalance.

So just drop the call to disable the clocks. (Which BTW was also in the
wrong order because the call makes the PWM unfunctional and so should
have come only after pwmchip_remove()).
