fs: move ramfs_aops to libfs

Move the ramfs aops to libfs and reuse them for kernfs and configfs.
Thosw two did not wire up ->set_page_dirty before and now get
__set_page_dirty_no_writeback, which is the right one for no-writeback
address_space usage.

Drop the now unused exports of the libfs helpers only used for ramfs-style
pagecache usage.
