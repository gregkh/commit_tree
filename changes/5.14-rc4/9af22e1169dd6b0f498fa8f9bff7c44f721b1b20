dt-binding: memory: pl353-smc: Fix the NAND controller node in the example

To be fully valid, the NAND controller node in the example should be
named nand-controller instead of flash, should be at the address @0,0
instead of @e1000000 and should have a couple of:
- #address-cells
- #size-cells
properties.

The label is being renamed nfc0 as well which is more usual than nand_0.
