bpf, devmap: Remove drops variable from bq_xmit_all()

As Colin pointed out, the first drops assignment after declaration will
be overwritten by the second drops assignment before using, which makes
it useless.

Since the drops variable will be used only once. Just remove it and
use "cnt - sent" in trace_xdp_devmap_xmit().

Fixes: cb261b594b41 ("bpf: Run devmap xdp_prog on flush instead of bulk enqueue")
