net: use %px to print skb address in trace_netif_receive_skb

The print format of skb adress in tracepoint class net_dev_template
is changed to %px from %p, because we want to use skb address
as a quick way to identify a packet.

Note, trace ring buffer is only accessible to privileged users,
it is safe to use a real kernel address here.
