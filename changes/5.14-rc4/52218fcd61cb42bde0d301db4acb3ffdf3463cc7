arm64: tlb: fix the TTL value of tlb_get_level

The TTL field indicates the level of page table walk holding the *leaf*
entry for the address being invalidated. But currently, the TTL field
may be set to an incorrent value in the following stack:

pte_free_tlb
    __pte_free_tlb
        tlb_remove_table
            tlb_table_invalidate
                tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly
                    tlb_flush

In this case, we just want to flush a PTE page, but the tlb->cleared_pmds
is set and we get tlb_level = 2 in the tlb_get_level() function. This may
cause some unexpected problems.

This patch set the TTL field to 0 if tlb->freed_tables is set. The
tlb->freed_tables indicates page table pages are freed, not the leaf
entry.
