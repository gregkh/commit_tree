kcsan: Refactor access_info initialization

In subsequent patches we'll want to split kcsan_report() into distinct
handlers for each report type. The largest bit of common work is
initializing the `access_info`, so let's factor this out into a helper,
and have the kcsan_report_*() functions pass the `aaccess_info` as a
parameter to kcsan_report().

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
