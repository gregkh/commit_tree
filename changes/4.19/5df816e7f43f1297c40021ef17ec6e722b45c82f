net/mlx5: Fix debugfs cleanup in the device init/remove flow

When initializing the device (procedure init_one), the driver
calls mlx5_pci_init to perform pci initialization. As part of this
initialization, mlx5_pci_init creates a debugfs directory.
If this creation fails, init_one aborts, returning failure to
the caller (which is the probe method caller).

The main reason for such a failure to occur is if the debugfs
directory already exists. This can happen if the last time
mlx5_pci_close was called, debugfs_remove (silently) failed due
to the debugfs directory not being empty.

Guarantee that such a debugfs_remove failure will not occur by
instead calling debugfs_remove_recursive in procedure mlx5_pci_close.
