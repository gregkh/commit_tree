x86/mm/pat: Make set_memory_np() L1TF safe

set_memory_np() is used to mark kernel mappings not present, but it has
it's own open coded mechanism which does not have the L1TF protection of
inverting the address bits.

Replace the open coded PTE manipulation with the L1TF protecting low level
PTE routines.

Passes the CPA self test.
