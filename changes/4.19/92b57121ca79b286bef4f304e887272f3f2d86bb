bpf: btf: export btf types and name by offset from lib

This patch introduces btf__resolve_type() function and exports two
existing functions from libbpf. btf__resolve_type follows modifier
types like const and typedef until it hits a type which actually takes
up memory, and then returns it. This function follows similar pattern
to btf__resolve_size but instead of computing size, it just returns
the type.

These  functions will be used in the followig patch which parses
information inside array of `struct btf_type *`. btf_name_by_offset is
used for printing variable names.
