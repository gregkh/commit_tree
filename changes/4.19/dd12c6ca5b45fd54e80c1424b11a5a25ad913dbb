drm/i915/execlists: Check for ce->state before destroy

As we may cancel the ce->state allocation during context pinning (but
crucially after we mark ce as operational), that means we may be asked
to destroy a nonexistent ce->state. Given the choice in handing a
complex error path on pinning, and just ignoring the lack of state in
destroy, choice the latter for simplicity.
