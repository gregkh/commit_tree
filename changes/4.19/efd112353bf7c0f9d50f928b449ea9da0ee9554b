arm64: svc: Ensure hardirq tracing is updated before return

We always run userspace with interrupts enabled, but with the recent
conversion of the syscall entry/exit code to C, we don't inform the
hardirq tracing code that interrupts are about to become enabled by
virtue of restoring the EL0 SPSR.

This patch ensures that trace_hardirqs_on() is called on the syscall
return path when we return to the assembly code with interrupts still
disabled.
