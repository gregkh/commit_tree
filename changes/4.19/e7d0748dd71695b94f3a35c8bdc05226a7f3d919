block: Switch struct packet_command to use struct scsi_sense_hdr

There is a lot of needless struct request_sense usage in the CDROM
code. These can all be struct scsi_sense_hdr instead, to avoid any
confusion over their respective structure sizes. This patch is a lot
of noise changing "sense" to "sshdr", but the final code is more
readable to distinguish between "sense" meaning "struct request_sense"
and "sshdr" meaning "struct scsi_sense_hdr".
