spi: add SPI controller driver for UniPhier SoC

Add SPI controller driver implemented in Socionext UniPhier SoCs.

UniPhier SoCs have two types SPI controllers; SCSSI supports a
single channel, and MCSSI supports multiple channels.
This driver supports SCSSI only.

This controller has 32bit TX/RX FIFO with depth of eight entry,
and supports the SPI master mode only.

This commit is implemented in PIO transfer mode, not DMA transfer.
