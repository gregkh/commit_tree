platform/x86: intel-hid: Add support for Device Specific Methods

In some of the recent platforms, it is possible that stand alone methods
for HEBC() or other methods used in this driver may not exist. In this
case intel-hid driver will fail to load and power button will not be
functional.

It is also possible that some quirks in this driver added for some
platforms may have same issue in loading intel-hid driver.

There is an update to the ACPI details for the HID event filter driver.
In the updated specification a _DSM is added, which has separate function
indexes for each of the previous stand alone methods.

This change brings in support for the _DSM and allows usage of function
index for corresponding stand alone methods.

Details of Device Specific Method:

Intel HID Event Filter Driver _DSM UUID:
eeec56b3-4442-408f-a792-4edd4d758054

• Function index 0: Returns a buffer with a bit-field representing the
supported function IDs.

Function Index	ASL Object
--------------------------------
1		BTNL
2		HDMM
3		HDSM
4		HDEM
5		BTNS
6		BTNE
7		HEBC
8		VGBS
9		HEBC

One significant change is to query the supported methods implemented on
the platform. So the previous HEBC() has two variants. HEBC v1 and
HEBC v2. The v2 version allowed further define which of the 5-button
are actually defined by the platform. HEBC v2 support is only available
via new DSM.

v1 Button details:
Bits [0] - Rotation Lock, Num Lock, Home, End, Page Up,
Page Down
Bits [1] - Wireless Radio Control
Bits [2] - System Power Down
Bits [3] - System Hibernate
Bits [4] - System Sleep/ System Wake
Bits [5] - Scan Next Track
Bits [6] - Scan Previous Track
Bits [7] - Stop
Bits [8] - Play/Pause
Bits [9] - Mute
Bits [10] - Volume Increment
Bits [11] - Volume Decrement
Bits [12] - Display Brightness Increment
Bits [13] - Display Brightness Decrement
Bits [14] - Lock Tablet
Bits [15] - Release Tablet
Bits [16] - Toggle Bezel
Bits [17] - 5 button array
Bits [18-31] - reserved

v2 Buttom details:
Bits [0-16] - Same as v1 version
Bits [17] - 5 button array
Bits [18] – Power Button
Bits [19] - W Home Button
Bits [20] - Volume Up Button
Bits [21] - Volume Down Button
Bits [22] – Rotation Lock Button
Bits [23-31] – reserved
