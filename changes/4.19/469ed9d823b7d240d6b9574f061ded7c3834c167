arm64: hugetlb: Fix handling of young ptes

In the contiguous bit hugetlb break-before-make code we assume that all
hugetlb pages are young.

In fact, remove_migration_pte is able to place an old hugetlb pte so
this assumption is not valid.

This patch fixes the contiguous hugetlb scanning code to preserve young
ptes.
