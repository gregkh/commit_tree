ipv6: defrag: drop non-last frags smaller than min mtu

don't bother with pathological cases, they only waste cycles.
IPv6 requires a minimum MTU of 1280 so we should never see fragments
smaller than this (except last frag).

v3: don't use awkward "-offset + len"
v2: drop IPv4 part, which added same check w. IPV4_MIN_MTU (68).
    There were concerns that there could be even smaller frags
    generated by intermediate nodes, e.g. on radio networks.
