staging:rtl8192u: Refactor enum dm_ratr_sta_e usage - Style

The enumerated type dm_ratr_sta_e was defined in the file
drivers/staging/rtl8192u/r8192U_dm.h but never actually used in that
file. The only variable which uses this enumerated type is 'ratr_state',
a member variable of the _rate_adaptive structure defined in the file
drivers/staging/rtl8192u/r8192U.h.

To clarify and place the enumerated type close to where it is used the
type was moved to the drivers/staging/rtl8192u/r8192U.h file.

In addition the member variable 'ratr_state' which uses the enumerated
constants was declared as being of type 'u8'. This negates any advantage
of the enumerated type, compiler type-checking, so that member variable's
type has been changed to being of the enumerated type.

The typedef from the enumerated type has been removed to clear the
checkpatch issue with defining new types. Additionally the name of the
type has been left as enum dynamic_ratr_state

This is a coding style change and should have no impact on runtime code
execution.
