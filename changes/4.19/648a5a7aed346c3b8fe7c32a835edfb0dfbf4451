net/smc: fix non-blocking connect problem

In state SMC_INIT smc_poll() delegates polling to the internal
CLC socket. This means, once the connect worker has finished
its kernel_connect() step, the poll wake-up may occur. This is not
intended. The wake-up should occur from the wake up call in
smc_connect_work() after __smc_connect() has finished.
Thus in state SMC_INIT this patch now calls sock_poll_wait() on the
main SMC socket.
