s390/mm: Add gmap pmd linking

Let's allow pmds to be linked into gmap for the upcoming s390 KVM huge
page support.

Before this patch we copied the full userspace pmd entry. This is not
correct, as it contains SW defined bits that might be interpreted
differently in the GMAP context. Now we only copy over all hardware
relevant information leaving out the software bits.
