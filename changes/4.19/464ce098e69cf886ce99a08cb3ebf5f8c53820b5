drm/vmwgfx: Stop using plane->fb in vmw_kms_helper_dirty()

Instead of plane->fb (which we're going to deprecate for atomic drivers)
we need to look at plane->state->fb. The maze of code leading to
vmw_kms_helper_dirty() wasn't particularly clear, but my analysis
concluded that the calls originating from vmw_*_primary_plane_atomic_update()
all pass in the crtc which means we'll never end up in this branch
of the function. All other callers use drm_modeset_lock_all() somewhere
higher up, which means accessing plane->state is safe.

v2: Drop the comment and make the code do what it did before (Thomas)
v3: Drop the bogus lockdep assert
