9p: Replace the fidlist with an IDR

The p9_idpool being used to allocate the IDs uses an IDR to allocate
the IDs ... which we then keep in a doubly-linked list, rather than in
the IDR which allocated them.  We can use an IDR directly which saves
two pointers per p9_fid, and a tiny memory allocation per p9_client.
