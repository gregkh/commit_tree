btrfs: do btrfs_free_stale_devices outside of device_list_add

btrfs_free_stale_devices() looks for device path reused for another
filesystem, and deletes the older fs_devices::device entry.

In preparation to handle locking in device_list_add, move
btrfs_free_stale_devices outside as these two functions serve a
different purpose.
