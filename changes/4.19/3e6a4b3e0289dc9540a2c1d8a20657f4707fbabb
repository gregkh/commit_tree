bpf/verifier: introduce BPF_PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE

BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGROUP_STORAGE maps are special in a way
that the access from the bpf program side is lookup-free.
That means the result is guaranteed to be a valid
pointer to the cgroup storage; no NULL-check is required.

This patch introduces BPF_PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE return type,
which is required to cause the verifier accept programs,
which are not checking the map value pointer for being NULL.
