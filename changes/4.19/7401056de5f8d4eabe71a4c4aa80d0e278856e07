drivers/firmware: psci_checker: stash and use topology_core_cpumask for hotplug tests

Commit 7f9545aa1a91 ("arm64: smp: remove cpu and numa topology
information when hotplugging out CPU") updates the cpu topology when
the CPU is hotplugged out. However the PSCI checker code uses the
topology_core_cpumask pointers for some of the cpu hotplug testing.
Since the pointer to the core_cpumask of the first CPU in the group
is used, which when that CPU itself is hotpugged out is just set to
itself, the testing terminates after that particular CPU is tested out.
But the intention of this tests is to cover all the CPU in the group.

In order to support that, we need to stash the topology_core_cpumask
before the start of the test and use that value instead of pointer to
a cpumask which will be updated on CPU hotplug.
