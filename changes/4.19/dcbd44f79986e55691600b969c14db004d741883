xfs: fix transaction leak on remote attr set/remove failure

The xattr remote value set/remove handlers both clear args.trans in
the error path without having cancelled the transaction. This leaks
the transaction, causes warnings around returning to userspace with
locks held and leads to system lockups or other general problems.

The higher level xfs_attr_[set|remove]() functions already detect
and cancel args.trans when set in the error path. Drop the NULL
assignments from the rmtval handlers and allow the callers to clean
up the transaction correctly.
