btrfs: scrub: Remove unused copy_nocow_pages and its callchain

Since commit ac0b4145d662a3b9e340 ("btrfs: scrub: Don't use inode pages
for device replace") the function is not used and we can remove all
functions down the call chain.

There was an optimization that reused inode pages to speed up device
replace, but broke when there was nodatasum and compressed page. The
potential performance gain is small so we don't loose much by removing
it and using scrub_pages same as the other pages.
