staging:rtl8192u: Refactor use of enum dm_dig_sta_e - Style

Refactor the use of the enumerated type dm_dig_sta_e, which is not
actually used for type checking by the compiler.

The typedef of dm_dig_sta_e is removed to clear the checkpatch issue
with defining new types, and the enumerated type is left with the name
enum dynamic_init_gain_state

The enumerated type defines values for the enumeration, which are used
by both dig_state and dig_highpwr_state, (members of the struct dig).
Both of those variables were defined as being of type u8. This negates
any usefulness of the use of the enumeration, (compiler type checking).

To make use of the compiler's type-checking the two member variables,
dig_state and dig_highpwr_state have been changed to being of type
enum dynamic_init_gain_state. The enumerated type has been moved above
the struct dig definition so that the enumeration is already defined
when the compiler reaches the two types using the enumerated type.

These changes, whilst convoluted, are purely coding style in nature and
should not impact runtime code execution.
