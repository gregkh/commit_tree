IB/uverbs: Remove the ib_uverbs_attr pointer from each attr

Memory in the bundle is valuable, do not waste it holding an 8 byte
pointer for the rare case of writing to a PTR_OUT. We can compute the
pointer by storing a small 1 byte array offset and the base address of the
uattr memory in the bundle private memory.

This also means we can access the kernel's copy of the ib_uverbs_attr, so
drop the copy of flags as well.

Since the uattr base should be private bundle information this also
de-inlines the already too big uverbs_copy_to inline and moves
create_udata into uverbs_ioctl.c so they can see the private struct
definition.
