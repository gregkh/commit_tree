mac80211: don't put null-data frames on the normal TXQ

Since (QoS) NDP frames shouldn't be put into aggregation nor are
assigned real sequence numbers, etc. it's better to treat them as
non-data packets and not put them on the normal TXQs, for example
when building A-MPDUs they need to be treated specially, and they
are more used for management (e.g. to see if the station is alive)
anyway.
