efi/arm: preserve early mapping of UEFI memory map longer for BGRT

The BGRT code validates the contents of the table against the UEFI
memory map, and so it expects it to be mapped when the code runs.

On ARM, this is currently not the case, since we tear down the early
mapping after efi_init() completes, and only create the permanent
mapping in arm_enable_runtime_services(), which executes as an early
initcall, but still leaves a window where the UEFI memory map is not
mapped.

So move the call to efi_memmap_unmap() from efi_init() to
arm_enable_runtime_services().
