xfs: don't use XFS_BMAPI_IGSTATE in xfs_map_blocks

We want to be able to use the extent state as a reliably indicator for
the type of I/O, and stop using the buffer head state.  For this we
need to stop using the XFS_BMAPI_IGSTATE so that we don't see merged
extents of different types.

Based on a patch from Dave Chinner.
