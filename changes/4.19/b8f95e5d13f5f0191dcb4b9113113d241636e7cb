fuse: umount should wait for all requests

fuse_abort_conn() does not guarantee that all async requests have actually
finished aborting (i.e. their ->end() function is called).  This could
actually result in still used inodes after umount.

Add a helper to wait until all requests are fully done.  This is done by
looking at the "num_waiting" counter.  When this counter drops to zero, we
can be sure that no more requests are outstanding.
