nvmet: add minimal ANA support

Add support for Asynchronous Namespace Access as specified in NVMe 1.3
TP 4004.

Just add a default ANA group 1 that is optimized on all ports.  This is
(and will remain) the default assignment for any namespace not epxlicitly
assigned to another ANA group.  The ANA state can be manually changed
through the configfs interface, including the change state.

Includes fixes and improvements from Hannes Reinecke.
