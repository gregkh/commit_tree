Input: pxrc - do not store USB device in private struct

The USB device is only needed during setup, so put it back after
initialization and do not store it in our private struct.

Also, the USB device is a parent of USB interface so our driver
model rules ensure that USB device should not disappear while
interface device is still there; there is no need to take reference
to the USB device.
