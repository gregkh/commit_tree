blk-mq: only attempt to merge bio if there is rq in sw queue

Only attempt to merge bio iff the ctx->rq_list isn't empty, because:

1) for high-performance SSD, most of times dispatch may succeed, then
there may be nothing left in ctx->rq_list, so don't try to merge over
sw queue if it is empty, then we can save one acquiring of ctx->lock

2) we can't expect good merge performance on per-cpu sw queue, and missing
one merge on sw queue won't be a big deal since tasks can be scheduled from
one CPU to another.
