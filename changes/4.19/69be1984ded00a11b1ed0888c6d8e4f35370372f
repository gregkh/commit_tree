drm: mali-dp: Call drm_crtc_vblank_reset on device init

Currently, if userspace calls drm_wait_vblank before the crtc is
activated the crtc vblank_enable hook is called, which in case of
malidp driver triggers some warninngs. This happens because on
device init we don't inform the drm core about the vblank state
by calling drm_crtc_vblank_on/off/reset which together with
drm_vblank_get have some magic that prevents calling drm_vblank_enable
when crtc is off.
