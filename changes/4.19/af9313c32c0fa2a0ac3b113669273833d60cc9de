dm cache: only allow a single io_mode cache feature to be requested

More than one io_mode feature can be requested when creating a dm cache
device (as is: last one wins).  The io_mode selections are incompatible
with one another, we should force them to be selected exclusively.  Add
a counter to check for more than one io_mode selection.
