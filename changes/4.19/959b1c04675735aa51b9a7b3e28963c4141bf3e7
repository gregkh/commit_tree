btrfs: close devices without offloading to a temporary list

Since commit 88c14590cdd6 ("btrfs: use RCU in btrfs_show_devname for
device list traversal") btrfs_show_devname no longer takes
device_list_mutex. As such the deadlock that 0ccd05285e7f ("btrfs: fix a
possible umount deadlock") aimed to fix no longer exists, we can free
the devices immediatelly and remove the code that does the pending work.
