rcu: Move grace-period pre-init delay after pre-init

The main race with the early part of grace-period initialization appears
to be with CPU hotplug.  To more fully open this race window, this commit
moves the rcu_gp_slow() from the beginning of the early initialization
loop to follow that loop, thus widening the race window, especially for
the rcu_node structures that are initialized last.  This commit also
expands rcutree.gp_preinit_delay from 3 to 12, giving the same overall
delay in the grace period, but concentrated in the spot where it will
do the most good.
