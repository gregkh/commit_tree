mtd: rawnand: denali: do not pass zero maxchips to nand_scan()

Commit 49aa76b16676 ("mtd: rawnand: do not execute nand_scan_ident()
if maxchips is zero") gave a new meaning for calling nand_scan_ident()
with maxchips=0.

It is a special usage for some drivers such as docg4, but actually
the Denali driver may pass maxchips=0 to nand_scan() when the driver
is enabled but no NAND chip is found on the board for some reasons.

If nand_scan_with_ids() is called with maxchips=0, nand_scan_ident()
is skipped, then nand_set_defaults() is skipped as well.  Thus, the
driver must set chip->controller beforehand.  Otherwise, nand_attach()
causes NULL pointer dereference.

In fact, the Denali controller knows the number of connected chips
before calling nand_scan_ident(); if DEVICE_RESET fails, there is no
chip in that chip select.  Then, denali_reset_banks() sets the maxchips
to the number of detected chips.  If no chip is found, maxchips is zero.

In this case, there is no point for calling nand_scan() because we know
it will fail for sure.  Let's make the probe function fail immediately.
