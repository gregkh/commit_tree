sch_cake: Add ingress mode

The ingress mode is meant to be enabled when CAKE runs downlink of the
actual bottleneck (such as on an IFB device). The mode changes the shaper
to also account dropped packets to the shaped rate, as these have already
traversed the bottleneck.

Enabling ingress mode will also tune the AQM to always keep at least two
packets queued *for each flow*. This is done by scaling the minimum queue
occupancy level that will disable the AQM by the number of active bulk
flows. The rationale for this is that retransmits are more expensive in
ingress mode, since dropped packets have to traverse the bottleneck again
when they are retransmitted; thus, being more lenient and keeping a minimum
number of packets queued will improve throughput in cases where the number
of active flows are so large that they saturate the bottleneck even at
their minimum window size.

This commit also adds a separate switch to enable ingress mode rate
autoscaling. If enabled, the autoscaling code will observe the actual
traffic rate and adjust the shaper rate to match it. This can help avoid
latency increases in the case where the actual bottleneck rate decreases
below the shaped rate. The scaling filters out spikes by an EWMA filter.
