powerpc/64s: Add support for software count cache flush

Some CPU revisions support a mode where the count cache needs to be
flushed by software on context switch. Additionally some revisions may
have a hardware accelerated flush, in which case the software flush
sequence can be shortened.

If we detect the appropriate flag from firmware we patch a branch
into _switch() which takes us to a count cache flush sequence.

That sequence in turn may be patched to return early if we detect that
the CPU supports accelerating the flush sequence in hardware.

Add debugfs support for reporting the state of the flush, as well as
runtime disabling it.

And modify the spectre_v2 sysfs file to report the state of the
software flush.
