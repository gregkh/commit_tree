pwm: meson: Fix mux clock names

Current clock name looks like this:
/soc/bus@ffd00000/pwm@1b000#mux0

This is bad because CCF uses the clock to create a directory in clk debugfs.
With such name, the directory creation (silently) fails and the debugfs
entry end up being created at the debugfs root.

With this change, the clock name will now be:
ffd1b000.pwm#mux0

This matches the clock naming scheme used in the ethernet and mmc driver.
It also fixes the problem with debugfs.
