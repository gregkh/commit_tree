s390/boot: block uncompressed vmlinux booting attempts

Since the plain vmlinux ELF file no longer carries all necessary parts
for starting up (like the entry point and decompressor), add a check
which would block boot process and encourage users to use bzImage or
arch/s390/boot/compressed/vmlinux instead.

The check relies on s390 linux entry point ABI definition, which is only
present in bzImage and arch/s390/boot/compressed/vmlinux.
