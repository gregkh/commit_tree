perf/x86/intel: Support PEBS on fixed counters

The Extended PEBS feature supports PEBS on fixed-function performance
counters as well as all four general purpose counters.

It has to change the order of PEBS and fixed counter enabling to make
sure PEBS is enabled for the fixed counters.

The change of the order doesn't impact the behavior of current code on
other platforms which don't support extended PEBS.
Because there is no dependency among those enable/disable functions.

Don't enable IRQ generation (0x8) for MSR_ARCH_PERFMON_FIXED_CTR_CTRL.
The PEBS ucode will handle the interrupt generation.
