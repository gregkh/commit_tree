staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page e Bit Mask definitions - Style

Remove the unused 'page e' Bit Mask definitions. These definitions will
fail the checkpatch CamelCase naming tests. As they are unused in code they
have simply been removed rather then renaming.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
