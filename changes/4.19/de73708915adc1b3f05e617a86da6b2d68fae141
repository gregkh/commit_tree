KVM: arm/arm64: Enable adaptative WFE trapping

Trapping blocking WFE is extremely beneficial in situations where
the system is oversubscribed, as it allows another thread to run
while being blocked. In a non-oversubscribed environment, this is
the complete opposite, and trapping WFE is just unnecessary overhead.

Let's only enable WFE trapping if the CPU has more than a single task
to run (that is, more than just the vcpu thread).
