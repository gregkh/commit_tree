nvme: use hw qid in trace events

We can not match a command to its completion based on the command
id alone. We need the submitting queue identifier to pair with the
completion, so this patch adds that to the trace buffer.

This patch is also collapsing the admin and IO submission traces into a
single one so we don't need to duplicate this and creating unnecessary
code branches: we know if the command is an admin vs IO based on the qid.

And since we're here, the patch fixes code formatting in the area.
