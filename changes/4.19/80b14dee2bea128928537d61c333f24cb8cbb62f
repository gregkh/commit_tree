net: Add a new socket option for a future transmit time.

This patch introduces SO_TXTIME. User space enables this option in
order to pass a desired future transmit time in a CMSG when calling
sendmsg(2). The argument to this socket option is a 8-bytes long struct
provided by the uapi header net_tstamp.h defined as:

struct sock_txtime {
	clockid_t 	clockid;
	u32		flags;
};

Note that new fields were added to struct sock by filling a 2-bytes
hole found in the struct. For that reason, neither the struct size or
number of cachelines were altered.
