net/mlx5e: Re-order fields of struct mlx5e_xdpsq

In the downstream patch that adds support to XDP_REDIRECT-out,
the XDP xmit frame function doesn't share the same run context as
the NAPI that polls the XDP-SQ completion queue.

Hence, need to re-order the XDP-SQ fields to avoid cacheline
false-sharing.

Take redirect_flush and doorbell out of DB, into separated
cachelines.

Add a cacheline breaker within the stats struct.
