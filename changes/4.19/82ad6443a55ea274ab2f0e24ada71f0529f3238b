drm/i915/gtt: Rename i915_hw_ppgtt base member

In the near future, I want to subclass gen6_hw_ppgtt as it contains a
few specialised members and I wish to add more. To avoid the ugliness of
using ppgtt->base.base, rename the i915_hw_ppgtt base member
(i915_address_space) as vm, which is our common shorthand for an
i915_address_space local.
