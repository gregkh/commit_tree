x86/KVM/VMX: Add L1D MSR based flush

336996-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channel-Mitigations.pdf defines a new MSR
(IA32_FLUSH_CMD aka 0x10B) which has similar write-only semantics to other
MSRs defined in the document.

The semantics of this MSR is to allow "finer granularity invalidation of
caching structures than existing mechanisms like WBINVD. It will writeback
and invalidate the L1 data cache, including all cachelines brought in by
preceding instructions, without invalidating all caches (eg. L2 or
LLC). Some processors may also invalidate the first level level instruction
cache on a L1D_FLUSH command. The L1 data and instruction caches may be
shared across the logical processors of a core."

Use it instead of the loop based L1 flush algorithm.
