rcu: Don't funnel-lock above leaf node if GP in progress

The old grace-period start code would acquire only the leaf's rcu_node
structure's ->lock if that structure believed that a grace period was
in progress.  The new code advances to the leaf's parent in this case,
needlessly acquiring then leaf's parent's ->lock.  This commit therefore
checks the grace-period state after marking the leaf with the need for
the specified grace period, and if the leaf believes that a grace period
is in progress, takes an early exit.
