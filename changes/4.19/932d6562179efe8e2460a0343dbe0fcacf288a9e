xen/gntdev: Add initial support for dma-buf UAPI

Add UAPI and IOCTLs for dma-buf grant device driver extension:
the extension allows userspace processes and kernel modules to
use Xen backed dma-buf implementation. With this extension grant
references to the pages of an imported dma-buf can be exported
for other domain use and grant references coming from a foreign
domain can be converted into a local dma-buf for local export.
Implement basic initialization and stubs for Xen DMA buffers'
support.
