perf evlist: Fix error out while applying initial delay and LBR

'perf record' will error out if both --delay and LBR are applied.

For example:

  # perf record -D 1000 -a -e cycles -j any -- sleep 2
  Error:
  dummy:HG: PMU Hardware doesn't support sampling/overflow-interrupts.
  Try 'perf stat'
  #

A dummy event is added implicitly for initial delay, which has the same
configurations as real sampling events. The dummy event is a software
event. If LBR is configured, perf must error out.

The dummy event will only be used to track PERF_RECORD_MMAP while perf
waits for the initial delay to enable the real events. The BRANCH_STACK
bit can be safely cleared for the dummy event.

After applying the patch:

  # perf record -D 1000 -a -e cycles -j any -- sleep 2
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 1.054 MB perf.data (828 samples) ]
