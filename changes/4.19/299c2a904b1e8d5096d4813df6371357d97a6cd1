drm/i915: Increase LSPCON timeout

100 ms is not enough time for the LSPCON adapter on Intel NUC devices to
settle. This causes dropped display modes at boot or screen reconfiguration.
Empirical testing can reproduce the error up to a timeout of 190 ms. Basic
boot and stress testing at 200 ms has not (yet) failed.

Increase timeout to 400 ms to get some margin of error.

Changes from v1:
The initial suggestion of 1000 ms was lowered due to concerns about delaying
valid timeout cases.
Update patch metadata.
