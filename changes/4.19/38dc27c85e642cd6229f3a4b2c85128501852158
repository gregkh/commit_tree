ARM: dts: uniphier: Add missing cooling device properties for CPUs

The cooling device properties, like "#cooling-cells" and
"dynamic-power-coefficient", should either be present for all the CPUs
of a cluster or none. If these are present only for a subset of CPUs of
a cluster then things will start falling apart as soon as the CPUs are
brought online in a different order. For example, this will happen
because the operating system looks for such properties in the CPU node
it is trying to bring up, so that it can register a cooling device.

Add such missing properties.
