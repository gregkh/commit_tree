ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add IN2 input mapping

During the recent cleanup series 3 of the 6 input mappings where removed
from the bytcr_rt5651 machine driver because testing showed that none of
them were used.

However some devices do actually have their internal mic on IN2 (and
only IN2, not IN1 and IN2), this did not show during previous tests
due to a bug in the userspace UCM input device switching code.

This commit re-adds the IN2 mapping for devices with the internal mic.
on IN2 and the headser mic on IN3 and enables this mapping on devices
with their internal mic on IN2.

This commit also changes the default internal mic input to IN2, because
all my 7 test devices have their mic there.
