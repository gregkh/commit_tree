torture: Make online/offline messages appear only for verbose=2

Some bugs reproduce quickly only at high CPU-hotplug rates, so the
rcutorture TREE03 scenario now has only 200 milliseconds spacing between
CPU-hotplug operations.  At this rate, the torture-test pair of console
messages per operation becomes a bit voluminous.  This commit therefore
converts the torture-test set of "verbose" kernel-boot arguments from
bool to int, and prints the extra console messages only when verbose=2.
The default is still verbose=1.
