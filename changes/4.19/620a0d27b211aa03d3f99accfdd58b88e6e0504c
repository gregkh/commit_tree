drm/amd/display: Implement backlight_ops.get_brightness

[Why]
This hook that is supposed to read the actual backlight value
is used in a few places throughout the kernel to setup or force
update on backlight

[How]
Create a dc function that calls the existing abm function, and
call that function from amdgpu
