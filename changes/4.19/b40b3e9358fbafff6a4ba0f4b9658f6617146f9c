mei: bus: type promotion bug in mei_nfc_if_version()

We accidentally removed the check for negative returns
without considering the issue of type promotion.
The "if_version_length" variable is type size_t so if __mei_cl_recv()
returns a negative then "bytes_recv" is type promoted
to a high positive value and treated as success.
