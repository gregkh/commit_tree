mmc: dw_mmc-exynos: fix potential external abort in resume_noirq()

dw_mci_exynos_resume_noirq() performs DWMMC register access without
ensuring that respective clocks are enabled. This might cause external
abort on some systems (observed on Exynos5433 based boards). Fix this
by forcing a PM runtime active state before register access. Using
SET_NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS allows also to cleanup conditional code
a bit.
