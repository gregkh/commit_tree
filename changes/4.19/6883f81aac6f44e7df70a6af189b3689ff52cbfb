pid: Implement PIDTYPE_TGID

Everywhere except in the pid array we distinguish between a tasks pid and
a tasks tgid (thread group id).  Even in the enumeration we want that
distinction sometimes so we have added __PIDTYPE_TGID.  With leader_pid
we almost have an implementation of PIDTYPE_TGID in struct signal_struct.

Add PIDTYPE_TGID as a first class member of the pid_type enumeration and
into the pids array.  Then remove the __PIDTYPE_TGID special case and the
leader_pid in signal_struct.

The net size increase is just an extra pointer added to struct pid and
an extra pair of pointers of an hlist_node added to task_struct.

The effect on code maintenance is the removal of a number of special
cases today and the potential to remove many more special cases as
PIDTYPE_TGID gets used to it's fullest.  The long term potential
is allowing zombie thread group leaders to exit, which will remove
a lot more special cases in the code.
