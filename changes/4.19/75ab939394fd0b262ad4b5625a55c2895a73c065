ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Add CPU regulator supplies for A83T boards

The OPPs for the A83T CPU cores were added in v4.17 in commit 2db639d8c166
("ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: add stable OPP tables and CPUfreq"), but board
level regulator supplies for the CPU clusters were only added for the
TBS-A711 tablet. This means the other A83T boards do not benefit from
voltage scaling, or worse, if the implementation does not scale the
frequency when the voltage is fixed, no benefit at all.

Add board level CPU cluster power supplies to all the A83T development
boards, so they can have proper dynamic CPU voltage and frequency scaling.
