drm/i915/gtt: Subclass gen6_hw_ppgtt

The legacy gen6 ppgtt needs a little more hand holding than gen8+, and
so requires a larger structure. As I intend to make this slightly more
complicated in the future, separate the gen6 from the core gen8 hw
struct by subclassing. This patch moves the gen6 only features out to
gen6_hw_ppgtt and pipes the new type everywhere that needs it.
