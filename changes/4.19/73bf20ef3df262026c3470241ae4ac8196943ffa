crypto: vmac - require a block cipher with 128-bit block size

The VMAC template assumes the block cipher has a 128-bit block size, but
it failed to check for that.  Thus it was possible to instantiate it
using a 64-bit block size cipher, e.g. "vmac(cast5)", causing
uninitialized memory to be used.

Add the needed check when instantiating the template.
