xen/gntdev: Make private routines/structures accessible

This is in preparation for adding support of DMA buffer
functionality: make map/unmap related code and structures, used
privately by gntdev, ready for dma-buf extension, which will re-use
these. Rename corresponding structures as those become non-private
to gntdev now.
