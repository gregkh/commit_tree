mtd: rawnand: qcom: fix null pointer access for erased page detection

parse_read_errors can be called with only oob_buf in which case
data_buf will be NULL.  If data_buf is NULL, then donâ€™t
treat this page as completely erased in case of ECC uncorrectable
error for RS ECC. For BCH ECC, the controller itself tells
regarding erased page in status register.
