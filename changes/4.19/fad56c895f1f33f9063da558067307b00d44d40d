ALSA: ctxfi: cthw20k2: Replace mdelay() with msleep() and usleep_range()

hw_pll_init(), hw_dac_stop(), hw_dac_start() and hw_adc_init()
are never called in atomic context.
They call mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
