ath10k: sdio: allocate correct size for RECV_1MORE_BLOCK rx packets

Without this, when receiving a packet that has this flag set
from firmware, we will read invalid trailer data from the packet,
which will be shown as various errors, e.g. "sdio mbox lookahead
is zero" or "invalid rx packet" or "payload length x exceeds max
htc length".
