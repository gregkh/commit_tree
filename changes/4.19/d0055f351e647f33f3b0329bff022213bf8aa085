x86/smp: fix non-SMP broken build due to redefinition of apic_id_is_primary_thread

The function has an inline "return false;" definition with CONFIG_SMP=n
but the "real" definition is also visible leading to "redefinition of
‘apic_id_is_primary_thread’" compiler error.

Guard it with #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
