staging: erofs: introduce error injection infrastructure

This patch introduces error injection infrastructure, with it, we can
inject error in any kernel exported common functions which erofs used,
so that it can force erofs running into error paths, it turns out that
tests can cover real rare paths more easily to find bugs.
