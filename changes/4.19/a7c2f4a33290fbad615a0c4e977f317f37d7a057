s390/qeth: add support for constrained HW headers

Some transmit modes require that the HW header is located in the same
page as the initial protocol headers in skb->data. Let callers specify
the size of this contiguous header range, and enforce it when building
the HW header.

While at it, apply some gentle renaming to the relevant L2 code so that
it matches the L3 code.
