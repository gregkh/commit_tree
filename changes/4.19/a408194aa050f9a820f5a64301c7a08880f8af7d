l2tp: define helper for parsing struct sockaddr_pppol2tp*

'sockaddr_len' is checked against various values when entering
pppol2tp_connect(), to verify its validity. It is used again later, to
find out which sockaddr structure was passed from user space. This
patch combines these two operations into one new function in order to
simplify pppol2tp_connect().

A new structure, l2tp_connect_info, is used to pass sockaddr data back
to pppol2tp_connect(), to avoid passing too many parameters to
l2tp_sockaddr_get_info(). Also, the first parameter is void* in order
to avoid casting between all sockaddr_* structures manually.
