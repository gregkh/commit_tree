scsi: mpt3sas: Fix for regression caused by sparse cleanups

Commit cf6bf9710cab ("scsi: mpt3sas: Bug fix for big endian systems") was
merged to address sparse warnings. However, the patch introduced a
regression on big endian since the code accidentally mixed I/O memory
accessors, which do endian swaps, and regular CPU loads and stores.

Do a partial revert of the offending commit.
