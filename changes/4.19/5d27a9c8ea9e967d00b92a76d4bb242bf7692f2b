spi: spi-mem: Extend the SPI mem interface to set a custom memory name

When porting (Q)SPI controller drivers from the MTD layer to the SPI
layer, the naming scheme for the memory devices changes. To be able
to keep compatibility with the old drivers naming scheme, a name
field is added to struct spi_mem and a hook is added to let controller
drivers set a custom name for the memory device.

Example for the FSL QSPI driver:

Name with the old driver: 21e0000.qspi,
or with multiple devices: 21e0000.qspi-0, 21e0000.qspi-1, ...

Name with the new driver without spi_mem_get_name: spi4.0
