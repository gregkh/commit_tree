ovl: Move some dir related ovl_lookup_single() code in else block

Move some directory related code in else block.  This is pure code
reorganization and no functionality change.

Next patch enables redirect processing on metacopy files and needs this
change.  By keeping non-functional changes in a separate patch, next patch
looks much smaller and cleaner.
