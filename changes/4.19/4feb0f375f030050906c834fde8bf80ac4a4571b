staging: bcm2835-audio: Check if workqueue allocation failed

Currently, if allocating a workqueue fails, the driver will probe
successfully but it will silently do nothing, which is rather silly.
So instead bail out with -ENOMEM in bcm2835_audio_open() if
alloc_workqueue() fails, and remove the now pointless checks for a NULL
workqueue.

While at it, get rid of the rather pointless one-line function
my_workqueue_init().
