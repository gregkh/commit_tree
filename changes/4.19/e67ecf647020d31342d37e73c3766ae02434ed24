arm64: topology: re-introduce numa mask check for scheduler MC selection

Commit 37c3ec2d810f ("arm64: topology: divorce MC scheduling domain from
core_siblings") selected the smallest of LLC, socket siblings, and NUMA
node siblings to ensure that the sched domain we build for the MC layer
isn't larger than the DIE above it or it's shrunk to the socket or NUMA
node if LLC exist acrosis NUMA node/chiplets.

Commit acd32e52e4e0 ("arm64: topology: Avoid checking numa mask for
scheduler MC selection") reverted the NUMA siblings checks since the
CPU topology masks weren't updated on hotplug at that time.

This patch re-introduces numa mask check as the CPU and NUMA topology
is now updated in hotplug paths. Effectively, this patch does the
partial revert of commit acd32e52e4e0.
