drm/i915/uc: Trivial s/dev_priv/i915 in intel_uc.c

Some functions already use i915 name instead of dev_priv.
Let's rename this param in all remaining functions, except
those that still use legacy macros.

v2: don't forget about function descriptions (Sagar)
v3: rebased
v4: rebased
v5: rebased, pulled out from the series
