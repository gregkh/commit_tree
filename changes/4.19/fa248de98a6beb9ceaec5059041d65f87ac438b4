xfs: don't assume a left rmap when allocating a new rmap

The original rmap code assumed that there would always be at least one
rmap in the rmapbt (the AG sb/agf/agi) and so errored out if it didn't
find one.  This assumption isn't true for the rmapbt repair function
(and it won't be true for realtime rmap either), so remove the check and
just deal with the situation.
