scsi: aacraid: stop using deprated get_seconds()

get_seconds() can overflow on 32-bit architectures and is deprecated
because of that. The use in the aacraid driver has the same problem due to
a limited firmware interface, it also overflows in the year 2106.

This changes all calls to get_seconds() to the non-deprecated
ktime_get_real_seconds(), which unfortunately doesn't solve that problem
but gets rid of one user of the deprecated interface.
