staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef and rename RX_TS_RECORD - Style

Remove the typedef from structure RX_TS_RECORD, this change clears the
checkpatch issue with creation of new types.

Additionally the structure is renamed from RX_TS_RECORD to rx_ts_record.
Whilst this is not raised as a checkpatch error structures are meant to
be named in lower case.

These changes are coding style changes which should have no impact on
runtime code execution.
