x86/cpu: Introduce INTEL_CPU_FAM*() helper macros

These macros are often used by drivers and there exists already a lot of
duplication as ICPU() macro across the drivers.

Provide a generic x86 macro for users.

Note, as Ingo Molnar pointed out this has a hidden issue when a driver
needs to preserve const qualifier. Though, it would be addressed
separately at some point.
