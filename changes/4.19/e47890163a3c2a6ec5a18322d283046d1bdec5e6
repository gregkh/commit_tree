crypto: sha512_generic - add cra_priority

sha512-generic and sha384-generic had a cra_priority of 0, so it wasn't
possible to have a lower priority SHA-512 or SHA-384 implementation, as
is desired for sha512_mb which is only useful under certain workloads
and is otherwise extremely slow.  Change them to priority 100, which is
the priority used for many of the other generic algorithms.
