drm/i915: Handle recursive shrinker for vma->last_active allocation

If we call into the shrinker for direct relcaim inside kmalloc, it will
retire the requests. If we retire the vma->last_active while processing a
new i915_vma_move_to_active() we can upset the delicate bookkeeping
required for the cache. After the possible invocation of the shrinker, we
need to double check the vma->last_active is still valid.
