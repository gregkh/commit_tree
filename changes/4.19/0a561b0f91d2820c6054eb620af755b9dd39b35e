staging: rtl8723bs: remove pointless if else in rtw_sdio_resume()

Whether any of the conditions is true or not, the return variable
is always set to rtw_resume_process(padapter). Replace the if else
construct with a single call to rtw_resume_process(). Also remove
the now unused local variable pwrpriv.
