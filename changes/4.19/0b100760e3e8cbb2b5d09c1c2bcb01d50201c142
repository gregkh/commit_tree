drm/i915/userptr: Enable read-only support on gen8+

On gen8 and onwards, we can mark GPU accesses through the ppGTT as being
read-only, that is cause any GPU write onto that page to be discarded
(not triggering a fault). This is all that we need to finally support
the read-only flag for userptr!

v2: Check default address space for read only support as a proxy for the
user context/ppgtt.
