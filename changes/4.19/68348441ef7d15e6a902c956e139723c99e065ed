IB/iser: set can_queue earlier to allow setting higher queue depth

We need to set can_queue earlier than when enabling the scsi host.
in a blk-mq enabled environment, the tagset allocation is taken
from can_queue which cannot be modified later. Also, pass an updated
.can_queue to iscsi_session_setup to have enough iscsi tasks allocated
in the session kfifo.
