usb: cdc-wdm: Fix a sleep-in-atomic-context bug in service_outstanding_interrupt()

wdm_in_callback() is a completion handler function for the USB driver.
So it should not sleep. But it calls service_outstanding_interrupt(),
which calls usb_submit_urb() with GFP_KERNEL.

To fix this bug, GFP_KERNEL is replaced with GFP_ATOMIC.

This bug is found by my static analysis tool DSAC.
