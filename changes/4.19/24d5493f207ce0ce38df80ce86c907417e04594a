block: simplify bio_check_pages_dirty

bio_check_pages_dirty currently inviolates the invariant that bv_page of
a bio_vec inside bi_vcnt shouldn't be zero, and that is going to become
really annoying with multpath biovecs.  Fortunately there isn't any
all that good reason for it - once we decide to defer freeing the bio
to a workqueue holding onto a few additional pages isn't really an
issue anymore.  So just check if there is a clean page that needs
dirtying in the first path, and do a second pass to free them if there
was none, while the cache is still hot.

Also use the chance to micro-optimize bio_dirty_fn a bit by not saving
irq state - we know we are called from a workqueue.
