net: mvpp2: use one RSS table per port

PPv2 Controller has 8 RSS Tables, of 32 entries each. A lookup in the
RXQ2RSS_TABLE is performed for each incoming packet, and the RSS Table
to be used is chosen according to the default rx queue that would be
used for the packet.

This default rx queue is set in the Lookup_id Table (also called
Decoding Table), and is equal to the port->first_rxq.

Since the Classifier itself isn't active at any time for the moment,
this doesn't have a direct effect, the default rx queue at the moment is
the one where all packets end-up into.
