libnvdimm: Export max available extent

The 'available_size' attribute showing the combined total of all
unallocated space isn't always useful to know how large of a namespace
a user may be able to allocate if the region is fragmented. This patch
will export the largest extent of unallocated space that may be allocated
to create a new namespace.
