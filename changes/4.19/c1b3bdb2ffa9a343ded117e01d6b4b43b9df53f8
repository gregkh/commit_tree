be2net: gather debug info and reset adapter (only for Lancer) on a tx-timeout

This patch handles a TX-timeout as follows:

1) This patch gathers and prints the following info that can
   help in diagnosing the cause of a TX-timeout.
   a) TX queue and completion queue entries.
   b) SKB and TCP/UDP header details.

2) For Lancer NICs (TX-timeout recovery is not supported for
   BE3/Skyhawk-R NICs), it recovers from the TX timeout as follows:

   a) On a TX-timeout, driver sets the PHYSDEV_CONTROL_FW_RESET_MASK
      bit in the PHYSDEV_CONTROL register. Lancer firmware goes into
      an error state and indicates this back to the driver via a bit
      in a doorbell register.
   b) Driver detects this and calls be_err_recover(). DMA is disabled,
      all pending TX skbs are unmapped and freed (be_close()). All rings
      are destroyed (be_clear()).
   c) The driver waits for the FW to re-initialize and re-creates all
      rings along with other data structs (be_resume())
