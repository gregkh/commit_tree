mm/sparse.c: add a static variable nr_present_sections

Patch series "mm/sparse: Optimize memmap allocation during
sparse_init()", v6.

In sparse_init(), two temporary pointer arrays, usemap_map and map_map
are allocated with the size of NR_MEM_SECTIONS.  They are used to store
each memory section's usemap and mem map if marked as present.  In
5-level paging mode, this will cost 512M memory though they will be
released at the end of sparse_init().  System with few memory, like
kdump kernel which usually only has about 256M, will fail to boot
because of allocation failure if CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y.

In this patchset, optimize the memmap allocation code to only use
usemap_map and map_map with the size of nr_present_sections.  This makes
kdump kernel boot up with normal crashkernel='' setting when
CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y.

This patch (of 5):

nr_present_sections is used to record how many memory sections are
marked as present during system boot up, and will be used in the later
patch.
