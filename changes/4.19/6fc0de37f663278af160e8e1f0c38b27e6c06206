x86/intel_rdt: Limit C-states dynamically when pseudo-locking active

Deeper C-states impact cache content through shrinking of the cache or
flushing entire cache to memory before reducing power to the cache.
Deeper C-states will thus negatively impact the pseudo-locked regions.

To avoid impacting pseudo-locked regions C-states are limited on
pseudo-locked region creation so that cores associated with the
pseudo-locked region are prevented from entering deeper C-states.
This is accomplished by requesting a CPU latency target which will
prevent the core from entering C6 across all supported platforms.
