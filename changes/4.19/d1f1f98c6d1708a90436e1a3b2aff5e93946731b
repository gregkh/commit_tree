sparc64: Set %l4 properly on trap return after handling signals.

If we did some signal processing, we have to reload the pt_regs
tstate register because it's value may have changed.

In doing so we also have to extract the %pil value contained in there
anre load that into %l4.

This value is at bit 20 and thus needs to be shifted down before we
later write it into the %pil register.

Most of the time this is harmless as we are returning to userspace
and the %pil is zero for that case.
