ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: drop GPIO lookup table for serio device

GPIO lookup table for ams-delta-serio device was introduced by commit
0486738928bf ("ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: add GPIO lookup tables").
Unfortunately, a follow up patch "Input: ams_delta_serio: use GPIO
lookup table" was not accepted by subystem maintainer who requested
conversion of the driver to a platform driver, replacepemnt of IRQ GPIO
pin with IRQ resource, replacement of GPIO pin providing keyboard power
with a regulator and removal of remaining GPIO pins from the driver as
not handled by it.

Let's start with removal of the no longer needed GPIO lookup table from
the board init file.
