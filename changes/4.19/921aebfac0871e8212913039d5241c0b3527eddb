lightnvm: pblk: fix read_bitmap for 32bit archs

If using pblk on a 32bit architecture, and there is a need to
perform a partial read, the partial read bitmap will only have
allocated 32 entries, where as 64 are needed.

Make sure that the read_bitmap is initialized to 64bits on 32bit
architectures as well.
