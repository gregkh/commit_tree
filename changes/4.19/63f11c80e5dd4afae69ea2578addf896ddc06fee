perf trace: Rename some syscall_tp methods to raw_syscall

Because raw_syscalls have the field for the syscall number as 'id' while
the syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}_NAME have it as __syscall_nr...

Since we want to support both for being able to enable just a
syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}_name instead of asking for
raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} plus filters, make the method names for
each kind of tracepoint more explicit.
