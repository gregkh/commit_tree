tracing: Fix synthetic event to accept unsigned modifier

Fix synthetic event to accept unsigned modifier for its field type
correctly.

Currently, synthetic_events interface returns error for "unsigned"
modifiers as below;

 # echo "myevent unsigned long var" >> synthetic_events
 sh: write error: Invalid argument

This is because argv_split() breaks "unsigned long" into "unsigned"
and "long", but parse_synth_field() doesn't expected it.

With this fix, synthetic_events can handle the "unsigned long"
correctly like as below;

 # echo "myevent unsigned long var" >> synthetic_events
 # cat synthetic_events
 myevent	unsigned long var
