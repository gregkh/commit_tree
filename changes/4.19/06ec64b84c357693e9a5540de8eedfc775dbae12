Kconfig: consolidate the "Kernel hacking" menu

Move the source of lib/Kconfig.debug and arch/$(ARCH)/Kconfig.debug to
the top-level Kconfig.  For two architectures that means moving their
arch-specific symbols in that menu into a new arch Kconfig.debug file,
and for a few more creating a dummy file so that we can include it
unconditionally.

Also move the actual 'Kernel hacking' menu to lib/Kconfig.debug, where
it belongs.
