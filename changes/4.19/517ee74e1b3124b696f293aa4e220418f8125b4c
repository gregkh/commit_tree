ASoC: wm_adsp: Correct algorithm list allocation size

Commit 6396bb221514 ("treewide: kzalloc() -> kcalloc()") was
overlooked when doing some refactoring to the algorithm list
handling, which lead to twice as much buffer being allocated
as required for reading the algorithm list. A kcalloc is no
longer appropriate since the allocation size is now in bytes
not registers, as such change back to kzalloc.
