init/: remove ineffective sparse disabling

Sparse checking used to be disabled on init/do_mounts.c and a few related
files because "Many of the syscalls used in this file expect some of the
arguments to be __user pointers not __kernel pointers".

However since 28128c61e ("kconfig.h: Include compiler types to avoid
missed struct attributes") the checks are, in fact, not disabled anymore
because of the more early include of "linux/compiler_types.h"

So remove the now ineffective #undefery that was done to disable these
warnings, as well as the associated comment.
