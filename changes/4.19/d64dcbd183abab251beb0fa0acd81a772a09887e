btrfs: make fs_devices a local variable in btrfs_parse_early_options

fs_devices is always passed to btrfs_scan_one_device which overrides it.
In the call stack below fs_devices is passed to btrfs_scan_one_device
from btrfs_mount_root.  In btrfs_mount_root the output fs_devices of
this call stack is not used.

btrfs_mount_root
  btrfs_parse_early_options
    btrfs_scan_one_device

So, it is not necessary to pass fs_devices from btrfs_mount_root, using
a local variable in btrfs_parse_early_options is enough.
