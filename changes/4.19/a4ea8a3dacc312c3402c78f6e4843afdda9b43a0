net: Add generic ndo_select_queue functions

This patch adds a generic version of the ndo_select_queue functions for
either returning 0 or selecting a queue based on the processor ID. This is
generally meant to just reduce the number of functions we have to change
in the future when we have to deal with ndo_select_queue changes.
