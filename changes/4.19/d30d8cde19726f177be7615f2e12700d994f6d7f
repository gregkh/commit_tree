net/mlx5e: Vxlan, replace ports radix-tree with hash table

The VXLAN database is accessed in the data path for each VXLAN TX skb in
order to check whether the UDP port is being offloaded or not.
The number of elements in the database is relatively small, we can
simplify the radix-tree to a hash table and speedup the lookup process.

Measuring mlx5e_vxlan_lookup_port execution time:

                  Radix Tree   Hash Table
 --------------- ------------ ------------
  Single Stream   161 ns       79  ns (51% improvement)
  Multi Stream    259 ns       136 ns (47% improvement)

Measuring UDP stream packet rate, single fully utilized TX core:
Radix Tree: 498,300 PPS
Hash Table: 555,468 PPS (11% improvement)
