perf stat: Get rid of extra clock display function

There's no reason to have separate function to display clock events.
It's only purpose was to convert the nanosecond value into microseconds.
We do that now in generic code, if the unit and scale values are
properly set, which this patch do for clock events.

The output differs in the unit field being displayed in its columns
rather than having it added as a suffix of the event name. Plus the
value is rounded into 2 decimal numbers as for any other event.

Before:

  # perf stat  -e cpu-clock,task-clock -C 0 sleep 3

   Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':

       3001.123137      cpu-clock (msec)          #    1.000 CPUs utilized
       3001.133250      task-clock (msec)         #    1.000 CPUs utilized

       3.001159813 seconds time elapsed

Now:

  # perf stat  -e cpu-clock,task-clock -C 0 sleep 3

   Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':

          3,001.05 msec cpu-clock                 #    1.000 CPUs utilized
          3,001.05 msec task-clock                #    1.000 CPUs utilized

       3.001077794 seconds time elapsed

There's a small difference in csv output, as we now output the unit
field, which was empty before. It's in the proper spot, so there's no
compatibility issue.

Before:

  # perf stat  -e cpu-clock,task-clock -C 0 -x, sleep 3
  3001.065177,,cpu-clock,3001064187,100.00,1.000,CPUs utilized
  3001.077085,,task-clock,3001077085,100.00,1.000,CPUs utilized

  # perf stat  -e cpu-clock,task-clock -C 0 -x, sleep 3
  3000.80,msec,cpu-clock,3000799026,100.00,1.000,CPUs utilized
  3000.80,msec,task-clock,3000799550,100.00,1.000,CPUs utilized

Add perf_evsel__is_clock to replace nsec_counter.
