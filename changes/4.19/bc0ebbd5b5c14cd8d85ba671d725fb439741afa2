ARM: imx: call imx6sx_cpuidle_init() conditionally for 6sll

The imx6sl platform has two different cpuidle implementations,
and fails to link if we only want one of the two:

arch/arm/mach-imx/mach-imx6sl.o: In function `imx6sl_init_late':
mach-imx6sl.c:(.init.text+0x12): undefined reference to `imx6sx_cpuidle_init'

This makes the call into reference conditional on the configuration.
