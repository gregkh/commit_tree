x86/microcode: Update the new microcode revision unconditionally

Handle the case where microcode gets loaded on the BSP's hyperthread
sibling first and the boot_cpu_data's microcode revision doesn't get
updated because of early exit due to the siblings sharing a microcode
engine.

For that, simply write the updated revision on all CPUs unconditionally.
