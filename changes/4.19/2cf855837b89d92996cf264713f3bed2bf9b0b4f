memcontrol: schedule throttling if we are congested

Memory allocations can induce swapping via kswapd or direct reclaim.  If
we are having IO done for us by kswapd and don't actually go into direct
reclaim we may never get scheduled for throttling.  So instead check to
see if our cgroup is congested, and if so schedule the throttling.
Before we return to user space the throttling stuff will only throttle
if we actually required it.
