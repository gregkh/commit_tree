blk-mq: issue directly if hw queue isn't busy in case of 'none'

In case of 'none' io scheduler, when hw queue isn't busy, it isn't
necessary to enqueue request to sw queue and dequeue it from
sw queue because request may be submitted to hw queue asap without
extra cost, meantime there shouldn't be much request in sw queue,
and we don't need to worry about effect on IO merge.

There are still some single hw queue SCSI HBAs(HPSA, megaraid_sas, ...)
which may connect high performance devices, so 'none' is often required
for obtaining good performance.

This patch improves IOPS and decreases CPU unilization on megaraid_sas,
per Kashyap's test.
