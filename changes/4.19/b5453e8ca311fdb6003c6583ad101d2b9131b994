ASoC: intel: Fix snd_pcm_format_t handling

As sparse warns, the PCM format type can't be dealt as integer as
found in Intel SST driver codes.

Fix them in the following two ways:

- The open code with snd_mask_set() and params->masks reference is
  replaced with params_set_format()

- The rest codes with snd_mask_set(fmt, SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_XXX) are
  replaced with the new helper, snd_mask_set_format().
