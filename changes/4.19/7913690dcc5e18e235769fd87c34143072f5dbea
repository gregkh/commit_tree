net/9p/client.c: version pointer uninitialized

The p9_client_version() does not initialize the version pointer. If the
call to p9pdu_readf() returns an error and version has not been allocated
in p9pdu_readf(), then the program will jump to the "error" label and will
try to free the version pointer. If version is not initialized, free()
will be called with uninitialized, garbage data and will provoke a crash.
