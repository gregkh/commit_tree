x86/speculation/l1tf: Increase l1tf memory limit for Nehalem+

On Nehalem and newer core CPUs the CPU cache internally uses 44 bits
physical address space. The L1TF workaround is limited by this internal
cache address width, and needs to have one bit free there for the
mitigation to work.

Older client systems report only 36bit physical address space so the range
check decides that L1TF is not mitigated for a 36bit phys/32GB system with
some memory holes.

But since these actually have the larger internal cache width this warning
is bogus because it would only really be needed if the system had more than
43bits of memory.

Add a new internal x86_cache_bits field. Normally it is the same as the
physical bits field reported by CPUID, but for Nehalem and newerforce it to
be at least 44bits.

Change the L1TF memory size warning to use the new cache_bits field to
avoid bogus warnings and remove the bogus comment about memory size.
