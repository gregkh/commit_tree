btrfs: Rename EXTENT_BUFFER_DUMMY to EXTENT_BUFFER_UNMAPPED

EXTENT_BUFFER_DUMMY is an awful name for this flag. Buffers which have
this flag set are not in any way dummy. Rather, they are private in the
sense that are not mapped and linked to the global buffer tree. This
flag has subtle implications to the way free_extent_buffer works for
example, as well as controls whether page->mapping->private_lock is held
during extent_buffer release. Pages for an unmapped buffer cannot be
under io, nor can they be written by a 3rd party so taking the lock is
unnecessary.
