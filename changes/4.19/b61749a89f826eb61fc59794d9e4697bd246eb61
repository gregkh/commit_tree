sound: enable interrupt after dma buffer initialization

In snd_hdac_bus_init_chip(), we enable interrupt before
snd_hdac_bus_init_cmd_io() initializing dma buffers. If irq has
been acquired and irq handler uses the dma buffer, kernel may crash
when interrupt comes in.

Fix the problem by postponing enabling irq after dma buffer
initialization. And warn once on null dma buffer pointer during the
initialization.
