ieee802154: hwsim: fix rcu handling

This patch adds missing rcu_assign_pointer()/rcu_dereference() to used rcu
pointers. There was already a previous commit c5d99d2b35da ("ieee802154:
hwsim: fix rcu address annotation"), but there was more which was
pointed out on my side by using newest sparse version.
