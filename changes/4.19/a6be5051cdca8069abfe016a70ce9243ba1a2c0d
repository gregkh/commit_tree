mtd: rawnand: fsl_ifc: Allow selection of this driver when COMPILE_TEST=y

It just makes maintainers' life easier by allowing them to compile-test
this driver without having FSL_SOC, ARCH_LAYERSCAPE or SOC_LS1021A
enabled.

We also need to add a dependency on HAS_IOMEM to make sure the
driver compiles correctly.
