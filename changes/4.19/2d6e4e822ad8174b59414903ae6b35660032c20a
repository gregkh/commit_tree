proc: fixup PDE allocation bloat

24074a35c5c975 ("proc: Make inline name size calculation automatic")
started to put PDE allocations into kmalloc-256 which is unnecessary as
~40 character names are very rare.

Put allocation back into kmalloc-192 cache for 64-bit non-debug builds.

Put BUILD_BUG_ON to know when PDE size has gotten out of control.
