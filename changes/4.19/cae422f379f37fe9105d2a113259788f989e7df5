net: sched: use reference counting action init

Change action API to assume that action init function always takes
reference to action, even when overwriting existing action. This is
necessary because action API continues to use action pointer after init
function is done. At this point action becomes accessible for concurrent
modifications, so user must always hold reference to it.

Implement helper put list function to atomically release list of actions
after action API init code is done using them.
