signal: Use PIDTYPE_TGID to clearly store where file signals will be sent

When f_setown is called a pid and a pid type are stored.  Replace the use
of PIDTYPE_PID with PIDTYPE_TGID as PIDTYPE_TGID goes to the entire thread
group.  Replace the use of PIDTYPE_MAX with PIDTYPE_PID as PIDTYPE_PID now
is only for a thread.

Update the users of __f_setown to use PIDTYPE_TGID instead of
PIDTYPE_PID.

For now the code continues to capture task_pid (when task_tgid would
really be appropriate), and iterate on PIDTYPE_PID (even when type ==
PIDTYPE_TGID) out of an abundance of caution to preserve existing
behavior.

Oleg Nesterov suggested using the test to ensure we use PIDTYPE_PID
for tgid lookup also be used to avoid taking the tasklist lock.
