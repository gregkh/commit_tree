net: hns3: fix return value error while hclge_cmd_csq_clean failed

While cleaning the command queue, the value of the HEAD register is not
in the range of next_to_clean and next_to_use, meaning that this value
is invalid. This also means that there is a hardware error and the
hardware will trigger a reset soon. At this time we should return an
error code instead of 0, and HCLGE_STATE_CMD_DISABLE needs to be set to
prevent sending command again.
