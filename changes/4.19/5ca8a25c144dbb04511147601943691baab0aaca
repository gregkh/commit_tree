net: sched: fix flush on non-existing chain

User was able to perform filter flush on chain 0 even if it didn't have
any filters in it. With the patch that avoided implicit chain 0
creation, this changed. So in case user wants filter flush on chain
which does not exist, just return success. There's no reason for non-0
chains to behave differently than chain 0, so do the same for them.
