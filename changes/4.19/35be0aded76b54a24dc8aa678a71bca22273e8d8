KVM: x86: SVM: Set EMULTYPE_NO_REEXECUTE for RSM emulation

Re-execution after an emulation decode failure is only intended to
handle a case where two or vCPUs race to write a shadowed page, i.e.
we should never re-execute an instruction as part of RSM emulation.

Add a new helper, kvm_emulate_instruction_from_buffer(), to support
emulating from a pre-defined buffer.  This eliminates the last direct
call to x86_emulate_instruction() outside of kvm_mmu_page_fault(),
which means x86_emulate_instruction() can be unexported in a future
patch.
