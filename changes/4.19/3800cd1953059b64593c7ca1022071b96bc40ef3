drm/i915/execlists: Stop storing the CSB read pointer in the mmio register

As we now never read back our current head position from the CSB
pointers register, and the HW itself doesn't use it to prevent
overwriting unread CSB entries, we do not need to keep updating the
register. As it turns out this register is not listed as being shadowed,
and so requires forcewake -- but we haven't been taking forcewake around
it so the writes has probably been regularly dropped. Fortuitously, we
only read the value after a reset where it did not matter, and zero was
the right answer (well, close enough).

Mika pointed out that this was how we used to do it (accidentally!)
before he fixed it in commit cc53699b25b5 ("drm/i915: Use masked write
for Context Status Buffer Pointer").
