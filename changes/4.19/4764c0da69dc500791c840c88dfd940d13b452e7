rxrpc: Trace packet transmission

Trace successful packet transmission (kernel_sendmsg() succeeded, that is)
in AF_RXRPC.  We can share the enum that defines the transmission points
with the trace_rxrpc_tx_fail() tracepoint, so rename its constants to be
applicable to both.

Also, save the internal call->debug_id in the rxrpc_channel struct so that
it can be used in retransmission trace lines.
