xfs: add firstblock field to xfs_trans

A firstblock var is typically allocated and initialized along with
xfs_defer_ops structures and passed around independent from the
associated transaction. To facilitate combining the two, add an
optional ->t_firstblock field to xfs_trans that can be used in place
of an on-stack variable.

The firstblock value follows the lifetime of the transaction, so
initialize it on allocation and when a transaction rolls.
