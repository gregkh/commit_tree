pinctrl: intel: Do pin translation in other GPIO operations as well

For some reason I thought GPIOLIB handles translation from GPIO ranges
to pinctrl pins but it turns out not to be the case. This means that
when GPIOs operations are performed for a pin controller having a custom
GPIO base such as Cannon Lake and Ice Lake incorrect pin number gets
used internally.

Fix this in the same way we did for lock/unlock IRQ operations and
translate the GPIO number to pin before using it.
