staging:rtl8192u: Remove proxy struct rtl819XMACPHY_Array_PG - Style

Remove the struct rtl819XMACPHY_Array_PG which is simply a proxy for
the struct Rtl8192UsbMACPHY_Array_PG. There appears to be no purpose
served by this implementation, other then to obscure the
Rtl8192UsbMACPHY_Array_PG structure.
