drm/i915: Refactor export_fence() after i915_vma_move_to_active()

Currently all callers are responsible for adding the vma to the active
timeline and then exporting its fence. Combine the two operations into
i915_vma_move_to_active() to move all the extra handling from the
callers to the single site.
