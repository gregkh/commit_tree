arm64: Fix mismatched cache line size detection

If there is a mismatch in the I/D min line size, we must
always use the system wide safe value both in applications
and in the kernel, while performing cache operations. However,
we have been checking more bits than just the min line sizes,
which triggers false negatives. We may need to trap the user
accesses in such cases, but not necessarily patch the kernel.

This patch fixes the check to do the right thing as advertised.
A new capability will be added to check mismatches in other
fields and ensure we trap the CTR accesses.
