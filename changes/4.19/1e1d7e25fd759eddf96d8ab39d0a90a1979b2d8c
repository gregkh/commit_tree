x86/cpu/AMD: Evaluate smp_num_siblings early

To support force disabling of SMT it's required to know the number of
thread siblings early. amd_get_topology() cannot be called before the APIC
driver is selected, so split out the part which initializes
smp_num_siblings and invoke it from amd_early_init().
