s390/qeth: allocate netdevice early

Allocation of the netdevice is currently delayed until a qeth card first
goes online. This complicates matters in several places, where we need
to cache values instead of applying them straight to the netdevice.

Improve on this by moving the allocation up to where the qeth card
itself is created. This is also one step in direction of eventually
placing the qeth card into netdev_priv().

In all subsequent code, remove the now redundant checks whether
card->dev is valid.
