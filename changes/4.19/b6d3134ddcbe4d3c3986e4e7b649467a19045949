arm64: dts: renesas: salvator-common: Add HSCIF1 device support

This patch adds pin control for HSCIF1, and supports connection with
Debug Serial-1 (CN26) on Salvator boards.

SCIF1 and HSCIF1 are sharing the pins connected to Debug Serial-1 (CN26)
on Salvator boards, and it is necessary to ensure that either SCIF1 or
HSCIF1 is enabled, not both.

As for the default of this DeviceTree, SCIF1 is connected.
