xen/balloon: fix balloon initialization for PVH Dom0

The current balloon code tries to calculate a delta factor for the
balloon target when running in HVM mode in order to account for memory
used by the firmware.

This workaround for memory accounting doesn't work properly on a PVH
Dom0, that has a static-max value different from the target value even
at startup. Note that this is not a problem for DomUs because guests are
started with a static-max value that matches the amount of RAM in the
memory map.

Fix this by forcefully setting target_diff for Dom0, regardless of
it's mode.
