staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused Rx Pseduo noise Bit Mask defs - Style

Remove the unused 'Rx Pseduo noise' Bit Mask definitions. These
definitions will fail the checkpatch CamelCase naming test. Since
the definitions are unused in code they have simply been removed,
rather then renaming.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
