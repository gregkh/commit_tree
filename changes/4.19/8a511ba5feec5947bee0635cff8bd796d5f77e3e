block, bfq: readd missing reset of parent-entity service

The received-service counter needs to be equal to 0 when an entity is
set in service. Unfortunately, commit "block, bfq: fix service being
wrongly set to zero in case of preemption" mistakenly removed the
resetting of this counter for the parent entities of the bfq_queue
being set in service. This commit fixes this issue by resetting
service for parent entities, directly on the expiration of the
in-service bfq_queue.
