iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: add support for position and pressure channels

This implements the support for position and pressure for the included
touchscreen support in the SAMA5D2 SOC ADC block.
Two position channels are added and one for pressure.
They can be read in raw format, or through a buffer.
A normal use case is for a consumer driver to register a callback buffer
for these channels.
When the touchscreen channels are in the active scan mask,
the driver will start the touchscreen sampling and push the data to the
buffer.

Some parts of this patch are based on initial original work by
Mohamed Jamsheeth Hajanajubudeen and Bandaru Venkateswara Swamy
