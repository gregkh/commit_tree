IB/ipoib: Get rid of the sysfs_mutex

This mutex was introduced to deal with the deadlock formed by calling
unregister_netdev from within the sysfs callback of a netdev.

Now that we have priv_destructor and needs_free_netdev we can switch
to the more targeted solution of running the unregister from a
work queue. This avoids the deadlock and gets rid of the mutex.

The next patch in the series needs this mutex eliminated to create
atomicity of unregisteration.
