fsnotify: pass connp and object type to fsnotify_add_mark()

Instead of passing inode and vfsmount arguments to fsnotify_add_mark()
and its _locked variant, pass an abstract object pointer and the object
type.

The helpers fsnotify_obj_{inode,mount} are added to get the concrete
object pointer from abstract object pointer.
