powerpc/mpic: Pass first free vector number to mpic_setup_error_int()

Update the comment to account for the spurious interrupt number. The
code was already accounting for it, but that was unclear because it
was achieved by mpic_setup_error_int() knowing that the number it was
passed was the last used vector, rather than the first free vector.

So change the meaning of the argument to the first free vector and
update the caller to pass 13, instead of 12, to achieve the same
result.
