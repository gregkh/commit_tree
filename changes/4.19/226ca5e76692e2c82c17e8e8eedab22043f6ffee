rcu: Identify grace period is in progress as we advance up the tree

There's no need to keep checking the same starting node for whether a
grace period is in progress as we advance up the funnel lock loop. Its
sufficient if we just checked it in the start, and then subsequently
checked the internal nodes as we advanced up the combining tree. This
also makes sense because the grace-period updates propogate from the
root to the leaf, so there's a chance we may find a grace period has
started as we advance up, lets check for the same.
