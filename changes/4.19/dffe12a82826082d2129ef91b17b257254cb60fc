gfs2: Fix gfs2_testbit to use clone bitmaps

Function gfs2_testbit is called in three places. Two of those places,
gfs2_alloc_extent and gfs2_unaligned_extlen, should be using the clone
bitmaps, not the "real" bitmaps. Function gfs2_unaligned_extlen is used
by the block reservations scheme to determine the length of an extent of
free blocks. Before this patch, it wasn't using the clone bitmap, which
means recently-freed blocks were treated as free blocks for the purposes
of an allocation.

This patch adds a new parameter to gfs2_testbit to indicate whether or
not the clone bitmaps should be used (if available).
