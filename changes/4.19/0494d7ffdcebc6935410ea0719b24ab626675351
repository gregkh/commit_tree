MIPS: Fix ISA virt/bus conversion for non-zero PHYS_OFFSET

isa_virt_to_bus() & isa_bus_to_virt() claim to treat ISA bus addresses
as being identical to physical addresses, but they fail to do so in the
presence of a non-zero PHYS_OFFSET.

Correct this by having them use virt_to_phys() & phys_to_virt(), which
consolidates the calculations to one place & ensures that ISA bus
addresses do indeed match physical addresses.
