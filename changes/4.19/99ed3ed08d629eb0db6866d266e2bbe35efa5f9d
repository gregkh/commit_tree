arm64: don't reload GPRs after apply_ssbd

Now that all of the syscall logic works on the saved pt_regs, apply_ssbd
can safely corrupt x0-x3 in the entry paths, and we no longer need to
restore them. So let's remove the logic doing so.

With that logic gone, we can fold the branch target into the macro, so
that callers need not deal with this. GAS provides \@, which provides a
unique value per macro invocation, which we can use to create a unique
label.
