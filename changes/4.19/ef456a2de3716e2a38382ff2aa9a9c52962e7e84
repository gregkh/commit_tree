i2c: imx: Simplify stopped state tracking

Always update the stopped state when busy status have been checked.
This is identical to what was done before, with the exception of error
handling.
Without this change, some errors cause the stopped state to be left in
incorrect state in i2c_imx_stop(), i2c_imx_dma_read(), i2c_imx_read() and
i2c_imx_xfer().
