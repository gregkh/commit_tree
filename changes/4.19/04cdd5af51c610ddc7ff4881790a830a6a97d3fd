clk: qcom: drop CLK_SET_RATE_GATE from sdc clocks

the mmci driver (drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c) does the following sequence:
* clk_prepare_enable()
* clk_set_rate()

on SDCx_clk which is a children of SDCx_src. SDCx_src has
CLK_SET_RATE_GATE so this sequence should not be allowed but this was not
enforced. IOW, the flag is ignored. Dropping the flag won't change
anything to the current behaviour of the platform.

CLK_SET_RATE_GATE is being fixed and enforced now. If the flag was kept,
the mmci driver would receive -EBUSY when calling clk_set_rate()
