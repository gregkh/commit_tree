checkpatch: fix SPDX license check with --root=<path>

checkpatch uses the in-kernel script spdxcheck.py to validate the specific
license in a file or script.

This check can currently fail for a couple reasons:

o spdxcheck.py assumes the existence of git tree that may not
  exist for a bare source tree from something like a tarball
o the spdxcheck.py must be run from the top level root directory

So add a git existence test and set the subprocess subdirectory.
