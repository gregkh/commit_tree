i2c: i801: Allow ACPI AML access I/O ports not reserved for SMBus

Commit 7ae81952cda ("i2c: i801: Allow ACPI SystemIO OpRegion to conflict
with PCI BAR") made it possible for AML code to access SMBus I/O ports
by installing custom SystemIO OpRegion handler and blocking i80i driver
access upon first AML read/write to this OpRegion.

However, while ThinkPad T560 does have SystemIO OpRegion declared under
the SMBus device, it does not access any of the SMBus registers:

    Device (SMBU)
    {
        ...

        OperationRegion (SMBP, PCI_Config, 0x50, 0x04)
        Field (SMBP, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
        {
            ,   5,
            TCOB,   11,
            Offset (0x04)
        }

        Name (TCBV, 0x00)
        Method (TCBS, 0, NotSerialized)
        {
            If ((TCBV == 0x00))
            {
            TCBV = (\_SB.PCI0.SMBU.TCOB << 0x05)
            }

            Return (TCBV) /* \_SB_.PCI0.SMBU.TCBV */
        }

        OperationRegion (TCBA, SystemIO, TCBS (), 0x10)
        Field (TCBA, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
        {
            Offset (0x04),
            ,   9,
            CPSC,   1
        }
    }

Problem with the current approach is that it blocks all I/O port access
and because this system has touchpad connected to the SMBus controller
after first AML access (happens during suspend/resume cycle) the
touchpad fails to work anymore.

Fix this so that we allow ACPI AML I/O port access if it does not touch
the region reserved for the SMBus.
