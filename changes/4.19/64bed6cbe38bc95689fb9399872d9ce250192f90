nfsd: fix leaked file lock with nfs exported overlayfs

nfsd and lockd call vfs_lock_file() to lock/unlock the inode
returned by locks_inode(file).

Many places in nfsd/lockd code use the inode returned by
file_inode(file) for lock manipulation. With Overlayfs, file_inode()
(the underlying inode) is not the same object as locks_inode() (the
overlay inode). This can result in "Leaked POSIX lock" messages
and eventually to a kernel crash as reported by Eddie Horng:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-unionfs&m=153086643202072&w=2

Fix all the call sites in nfsd/lockd that should use locks_inode().
This is a correctness bug that manifested when overlayfs gained
NFS export support in v4.16.
