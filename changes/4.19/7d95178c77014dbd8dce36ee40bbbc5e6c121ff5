ext4: check for NUL characters in extended attribute's name

Extended attribute names are defined to be NUL-terminated, so the name
must not contain a NUL character.  This is important because there are
places when remove extended attribute, the code uses strlen to
determine the length of the entry.  That should probably be fixed at
some point, but code is currently really messy, so the simplest fix
for now is to simply validate that the extended attributes are sane.
