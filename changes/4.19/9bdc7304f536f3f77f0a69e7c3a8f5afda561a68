xen/grant-table: Allow allocating buffers suitable for DMA

Extend grant table module API to allow allocating buffers that can
be used for DMA operations and mapping foreign grant references
on top of those.
The resulting buffer is similar to the one allocated by the balloon
driver in that proper memory reservation is made by
({increase|decrease}_reservation and VA mappings are updated if
needed).
This is useful for sharing foreign buffers with HW drivers which
cannot work with scattered buffers provided by the balloon driver,
but require DMAable memory instead.
