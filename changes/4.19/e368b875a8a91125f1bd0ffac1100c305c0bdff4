KVM: vmx: refactor segmentation code in vmx_save_host_state()

Use local variables in vmx_save_host_state() to temporarily track
the selector and base values for FS and GS, and reorganize the
code so that the 64-bit vs 32-bit portions are contained within
a single #ifdef.  This refactoring paves the way for future patches
to modify the updating of VMCS state with minimal changes to the
code, and (hopefully) simplifies resolving a likely conflict with
another in-flight patch[1] by being the whipping boy for future
patches.
