staging:rtl8192u: Refactor enum DM_CCK_Rx_Path_Method - Style

The enumerated type DM_CCK_Rx_Path_Method is used as a container for
constant definitions, rather then an enumerated type enabling compiler
type checking. To correct this, the variable which uses the constants,
defined by the enumeration, has had its type changed from a u8 to the
enumeration.

Additionally the type has been moved above the structure where the type
is used, to avoid compiler error. The typedef has been removed from the
enumerated type to clear the checkpatch issue with defining new types.
The name of the type has been changed to cck_rx_path_method to clear
the checkpatch issue with CamelCase naming. And the enumerated constant
CCK_Rx_Version_MAX has been removed, since it is never used in code.

The changes are all coding style in nature and so should have no
impact on runtime code execution.
