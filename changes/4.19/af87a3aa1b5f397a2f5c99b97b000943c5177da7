veth: Add ndo_xdp_xmit

This allows NIC's XDP to redirect packets to veth. The destination veth
device enqueues redirected packets to the napi ring of its peer, then
they are processed by XDP on its peer veth device.
This can be thought as calling another XDP program by XDP program using
REDIRECT, when the peer enables driver XDP.

Note that when the peer veth device does not set driver xdp, redirected
packets will be dropped because the peer is not ready for NAPI.

v4:
- Don't use xdp_ok_fwd_dev() because checking IFF_UP is not necessary.
  Add comments about it and check only MTU.

v2:
- Drop the part converting xdp_frame into skb when XDP is not enabled.
- Implement bulk interface of ndo_xdp_xmit.
- Implement XDP_XMIT_FLUSH bit and drop ndo_xdp_flush.
