xfs: remove the imap_valid flag

Simplify the way we check for a valid imap - we know we have a valid
mapping after xfs_map_blocks returned successfully, and we know we can
call xfs_imap_valid on any imap, as it will always fail on a
zero-initialized map.

We can also remove the xfs_imap_valid function and fold it into
xfs_map_blocks now.
