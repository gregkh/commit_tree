spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix per transfer cs_change handling

As of 92dc20d83adec565378254c0630e839ff5674e14, transfer->cs_change has
been supported for non-last transfers, but not for last transfer.

This change brings handling of cs_change in line with the specification in
spi.h, implementing handling of transfer->cs_change for all transfers.

The value for CMD FIFO is precalculated with transfer->cs_change field
taken into account, allowing for CS de-activate between transfers and
keeping CS activated after last transfer.
