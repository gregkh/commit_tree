samples: disable CONFIG_SAMPLES for UML

Some samples require headers installation, so commit 3fca1700c4c3
("kbuild: make samples really depend on headers_install") added
such dependency in the top Makefile. However, UML fails to build
with CONFIG_SAMPLES=y because UML does not support headers_install.
