ALSA: hda/realtek - Cannot adjust speaker's volume on Dell XPS 27 7760

The issue is the same as commit dd9aa335c880 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Can't
adjust speaker's volume on a Dell AIO"), the output requires to connect
to a node with Amp-out capability.

Applying the same fixup ALC298_FIXUP_SPK_VOLUME can fix the issue.
