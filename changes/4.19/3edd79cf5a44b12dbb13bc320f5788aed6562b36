regulator: Fix 'do-nothing' value for regulators without suspend state

Some regulators don't have all states defined and in such cases regulator
core should not assume anything. However in current implementation
of of_get_regulation_constraints() DO_NOTHING_IN_SUSPEND enable value was
set only for regulators which had suspend node defined, otherwise the
default 0 value was used, what means DISABLE_IN_SUSPEND. This lead to
broken system suspend/resume on boards, which had simple regulator
constraints definition (without suspend state nodes).

To avoid further mismatches between the default and uninitialized values
of the suspend enabled/disabled states, change the values of the them,
so default '0' means DO_NOTHING_IN_SUSPEND.
