ARM: dts: imx51-zii-rdu1: Make sure SD1_WP is low

Make sure that MX51_PAD_GPIO1_1 does not remain configure as
ALT0/SD1_WP (it is out of reset). This is needed because of external
pull-up resistor attached to that pad that, when left unchanged, will
drive SD1_WP high preventing eSDHC1/eMMC from working correctly.

To fix that add a pinmux configuration line configureing the pad to
function as a GPIO. While we are at it, add a corresponding
output-high GPIO hog in an effort to minimize current consumption.
