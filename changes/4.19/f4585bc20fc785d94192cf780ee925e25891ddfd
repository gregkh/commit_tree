apparmor: Fully initialize aa_perms struct when answering userspace query

Fully initialize the aa_perms struct in profile_query_cb() to avoid the
potential of using an uninitialized struct member's value in a response
to a query from userspace.

Detected by CoverityScan CID#1415126 ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
