mei: add support for variable length mei headers.

Remove header size knowledge from me and txe hw layers,
this requires to change the write handler to accept
header and its length as well as data and its length.

HBM messages are fixed to use basic header, hence we add mei_hbm2slots()
that converts HBM message length and mei message header,
while mei_data2slots() converts data length directly to the slots.
