ice: Set VLAN flags correctly

In the struct ice_aqc_vsi_props the field port_vlan_flags is an
overloaded term because it is used for both port VLANs (PVLANs) and
regular VLANs. This is an issue and is very confusing especially when
dealing with VFs because normal VLANs and port VLANs are not the same.
To fix this the field was renamed to vlan_flags and all of the #define's
labeled *_PVLAN_* were renamed to *_VLAN_* if they are not specific to
port VLANs.

Also in ice_vsi_manage_vlan_stripping, set the ICE_AQ_VSI_VLAN_MODE_ALL
bit to allow the driver to add a VLAN tag to all packets it sends.
