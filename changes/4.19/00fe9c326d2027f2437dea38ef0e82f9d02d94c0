bnxt_en: Do not adjust max_cp_rings by the ones used by RDMA.

Currently, the driver adjusts the bp->hw_resc.max_cp_rings by the number
of MSIX vectors used by RDMA.  There is one code path in open that needs
to check the true max_cp_rings including any used by RDMA.  This code
is now checking for the reduced max_cp_rings which will fail when the
number of cp rings is very small.

To fix this in a clean way, we don't adjust max_cp_rings anymore.
Instead, we add a helper bnxt_get_max_func_cp_rings_for_en() to get the
reduced max_cp_rings when appropriate.
