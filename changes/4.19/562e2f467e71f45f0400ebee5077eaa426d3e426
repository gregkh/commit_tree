net: mvneta: Improve the buffer allocation method for SWBM

With system having a small memory (around 256MB), the state "cannot
allocate memory to refill with new buffer" is reach pretty quickly.

By this patch we changed buffer allocation method to a better handling of
this use case by avoiding memory allocation issues.
