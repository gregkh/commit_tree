torture: Use a single build directory for torture scenarios

The torture scripting currently builds each kernel from a set of parallel
runs in its own build directory.  This can waste quite a bit of space when
running large numbers of concurrent scenarios, and pointlessly given that
the builds are run sequentially (albeit with a largish -j number passed to
"make").  This commit therefore places all build-command output in the
results directory, then does all builds in a single "b1" build directory.
