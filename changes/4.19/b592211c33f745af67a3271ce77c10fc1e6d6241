dm mpath: fix attached_handler_name leak and dangling hw_handler_name pointer

Commit e8f74a0f0011 ("dm mpath: eliminate need to use
scsi_device_from_queue") introduced 2 regressions:
1) memory leak occurs if attached_handler_name is not assigned to
   m->hw_handler_name
2) m->hw_handler_name can become a dangling pointer if the
   RETAIN_ATTACHED_HW_HANDLER flag is set and scsi_dh_attach() returns
   -EBUSY.

Fix both of these by clearing 'attached_handler_name' pointer passed to
setup_scsi_dh() after it is assigned to m->hw_handler_name.  And if
setup_scsi_dh() doesn't consume 'attached_handler_name' parse_path()
will kfree() it.
