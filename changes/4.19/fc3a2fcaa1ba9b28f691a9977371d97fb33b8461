mwifiex: use atomic bitops to represent adapter status variables

Driver is using boolean variables to maintain vairous status
information of adapter. These status variables are accessed by
multiple threads and there is a possibility of a race. To avoid
this, convert these variables to a set of bitops flags, to be
operated atomically.

Below variables of mwifiex_adapter are converted to bitop flags:
surprise_removed
is_cmd_timedout
is_suspended
is_hs_configured
hs_enabling
