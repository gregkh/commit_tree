staging:rtl8192u: Refactor union TSPEC_BODY - Style

The union TSPEC_BODY is never used as a union. The union comprises an
array of bytes and a bitfield structure, both of which are 55 bytes in
length, but the byte array is never used. As a result the union has
been truncated to the bitfield struct, which is actually used.

Additionally the typedef has been removed from the structure to clear
the checkpatch issue with defining new types. Additionally the name has
been changed to lowercase to comply with coding style.

These changes are all coding style changes which should have no impact
on runtime code execution.
