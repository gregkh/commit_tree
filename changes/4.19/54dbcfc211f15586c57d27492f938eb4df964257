powerpc/64s: Report SLB multi-hit rather than parity error

When we take an SLB multi-hit on bare metal, we see both the multi-hit
and parity error bits set in DSISR. The user manuals indicates this is
expected to always happen on Power8, whereas on Power9 it says a
multi-hit will "usually" also cause a parity error.

We decide what to do based on the various error tables in mce_power.c,
and because we process them in order and only report the first, we
currently always report a parity error but not the multi-hit, eg:

  Severe Machine check interrupt [Recovered]
    Initiator: CPU
    Error type: SLB [Parity]
      Effective address: c000000ffffd4300

Although this is correct, it leaves the user wondering why they got a
parity error. It would be clearer instead if we reported the
multi-hit because that is more likely to be simply a software bug,
whereas a true parity error is possibly an indication of a bad core.

We can do that simply by reordering the error tables so that multi-hit
appears before parity. That doesn't affect the error recovery at all,
because we flush the SLB either way.
