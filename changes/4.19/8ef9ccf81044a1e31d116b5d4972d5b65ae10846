fsi: master-gpio: Add missing release function

The embedded struct device needs a release function to be
able to successfully remove the driver.

We remove the devm_gpiod_put() as they are unnecessary
(the resources will be released automatically) and because
fsi_master_unregister() will cause the master structure to
be freed.
