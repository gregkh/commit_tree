bnxt_en: Fix VNIC reservations on the PF.

The enables bit for VNIC was set wrong when calling the HWRM_FUNC_CFG
firmware call to reserve VNICs.  This has the effect that the firmware
will keep a large number of VNICs for the PF, and having very few for
VFs.  DPDK driver running on the VFs, which requires more VNICs, may not
work properly as a result.

Fixes: 674f50a5b026 ("bnxt_en: Implement new method to reserve rings.")
