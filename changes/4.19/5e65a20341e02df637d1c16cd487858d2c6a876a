blk-wbt: wake up all when we scale up, not down

Tetsuo brought to my attention that I screwed up the scale_up/scale_down
helpers when I factored out the rq-qos code.  We need to wake up all the
waiters when we add slots for requests to make, not when we shrink the
slots.  Otherwise we'll end up things waiting forever.  This was a
mistake and simply puts everything back the way it was.
