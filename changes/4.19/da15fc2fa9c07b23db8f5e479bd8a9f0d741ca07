perf tools: Disable parallelism for 'make clean'

The Yocto build system does a 'make clean' when rebuilding due to
changed dependencies, and that consistently fails for me (causing the
whole BSP build to fail) with errors such as

| find: '[...]/perf/1.0-r9/perf-1.0/plugin_mac80211.so': No such file or directory
| find: '[...]/perf/1.0-r9/perf-1.0/plugin_mac80211.so': No such file or directory
| find: find: '[...]/perf/1.0-r9/perf-1.0/libtraceevent.a''[...]/perf/1.0-r9/perf-1.0/libtraceevent.a': No such file or directory: No such file or directory
|
[...]
| find: cannot delete '/mnt/xfs/devel/pil/yocto/tmp-glibc/work/wandboard-oe-linux-gnueabi/perf/1.0-r9/perf-1.0/util/.pstack.o.cmd': No such file or directory

Apparently (despite the comment), 'make clean' ends up launching
multiple sub-makes that all want to remove the same things - perhaps
this only happens in combination with a O=... parameter. In any case, we
don't lose much by explicitly disabling the parallelism for the clean
target, and it makes automated builds much more reliable.
