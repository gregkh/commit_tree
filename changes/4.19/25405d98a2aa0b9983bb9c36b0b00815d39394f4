IB/ipoib: Do not remove child devices from within the ndo_uninit

Switching to priv_destructor and needs_free_netdev created a subtle
ordering problem in ipoib_remove_one.

Now that unregister_netdev frees the netdev and priv we must ensure that
the children are unregistered before trying to unregister the parent,
or child unregister will use after free.

The solution is to unregister the children, then parent, in the same batch
all while holding the rtnl_lock. This closes all the races where a new
child could have been added and ensures proper ordering.
