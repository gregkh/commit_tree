s390: disable gcc plugins

The s390 build currently fails with the latent entropy plugin:

arch/s390/kernel/als.o: In function `verify_facilities':
als.c:(.init.text+0x24): undefined reference to `latent_entropy'
als.c:(.init.text+0xae): undefined reference to `latent_entropy'
make[3]: *** [arch/s390/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 1
make[2]: *** [arch/s390/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 2
make[1]: *** [bzImage] Error 2

This will be fixed with the early boot rework from Vasily, which
is planned for the 4.19 merge window.

For 4.18 the simplest solution is to disable the gcc plugins and
reenable them after the early boot rework is upstream.
