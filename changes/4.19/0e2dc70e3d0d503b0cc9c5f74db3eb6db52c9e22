bitfield: add tests

Add tests for the bitfield helpers. The constant ones will all
be folded to nothing by the compiler (if everything is correct
in the header file), and the variable ones do some tests against
open-coding the necessary shifts.

A few test cases that should fail/warn compilation are provided
under ifdef.
