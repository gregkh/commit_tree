net: pch_gbe: Remove sw_reset_phy HAL abstraction

For some reason the pch_gbe driver contains a struct pch_gbe_functions
with pointers used by a HAL abstraction layer, even though there is only
one implementation of each function.

This patch removes the sw_reset_phy abstraction, which it turns out is
never even used. Its one implementation, which is already called
directly within the same translation unit, can therefore be made static
and removed from the pch_gbe_phy.h header.
