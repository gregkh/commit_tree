tcp_bbr: in restart from idle, see if we should exit PROBE_RTT

This patch fix the case where BBR does not exit PROBE_RTT mode when
it restarts from idle. When BBR restarts from idle and if BBR is in
PROBE_RTT mode, BBR should check if it's time to exit PROBE_RTT. If
yes, then BBR should exit PROBE_RTT mode and restore the cwnd to its
full value.
