mm: clarify CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING and usage

The Kconfig text for CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING doesn't mention that it has to
be enabled explicitly.  This updates the documentation for that and adds a
note about CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING to the "page_poison" command line docs.
While here, change description of CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO too, as it's
not "random" data, but rather the fixed debugging value that would be used
when not zeroing.  Additionally removes a stray "bool" in the Kconfig.
