ASoC: meson: add axg fifo base driver

Amlogic's axg SoCs have two types of fifos which are the memory
interfaces of the audio subsystem. FRDDR provides the playback
interface while TODDR provides the capture interface.

The way these fifos operate is very similar. Only a few settings
are specific to each.

They implement the same pcm driver here and the specifics of each
will be dealt with the related DAI driver.
