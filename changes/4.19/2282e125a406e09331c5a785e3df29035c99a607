leds: triggers: let struct led_trigger::activate() return an error code

Given that activating a trigger can fail, let the callback return an
indication. This prevents to have a trigger active according to the
"trigger" sysfs attribute but not functional.

All users are changed accordingly to return 0 for now. There is no intended
change in behaviour.
