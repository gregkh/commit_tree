ovl: Use out_err instead of out_nomem

Right now we use goto out_nomem which assumes error code is -ENOMEM.  But
there are other errors returned like -ESTALE as well.  So instead of
out_nomem, use out_err which will do ERR_PTR(err).  That way one can put
error code in err and jump to out_err.

This just code reorganization and no change of functionality.

I am about to add more code and this organization helps laying more code
and error paths on top of it.
