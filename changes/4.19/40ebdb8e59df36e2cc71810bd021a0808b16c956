KVM: s390: Make huge pages unavailable in ucontrol VMs

We currently do not notify all gmaps when using gmap_pmdp_xchg(), due
to locking constraints. This makes ucontrol VMs, which is the only VM
type that creates multiple gmaps, incompatible with huge pages. Also
we would need to hold the guest_table_lock of all gmaps that have this
vmaddr maped to synchronize access to the pmd.

ucontrol VMs are rather exotic and creating a new locking concept is
no easy task. Hence we return EINVAL when trying to active
KVM_CAP_S390_HPAGE_1M and report it as being not available when
checking for it.
