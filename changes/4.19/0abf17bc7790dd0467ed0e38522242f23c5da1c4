sched/swait: Switch to full exclusive mode

Linus noted that swait basically implements exclusive mode -- because
swake_up() only wakes a single waiter. And because of that it should
take care to properly deal with the interruptible case.

In short, the problem is that swake_up() can race with a signal. In
this this case it is possible the swake_up() 'wakes' the waiter that
is already on the way out because it just got a signal and the wakeup
gets lost.

The normal wait code is very careful and avoids this situation, make
sure we do too.

Copy the exact exclusive semantics from wait.
