staging: android: ashmem: Shrink directly through shmem_fallocate

When ashmem_shrink is called from direct reclaim on a user thread, a
call to do_fallocate will check for permissions against the security
policy of that user thread.  It can thus fail by chance if called on a
thread that isn't permitted to modify the relevant ashmem areas.

Because we know that we have a shmem file underneath, call the shmem
implementation of fallocate directly instead of going through the
user-space interface for fallocate.
