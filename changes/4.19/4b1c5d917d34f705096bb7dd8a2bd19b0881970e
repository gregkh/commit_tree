bpf: btf: Fix end boundary calculation for type section

The end boundary math for type section is incorrect in
btf_check_all_metas().  It just happens that hdr->type_off
is always 0 for now because there are only two sections
(type and string) and string section must be at the end (ensured
in btf_parse_str_sec).

However, type_off may not be 0 if a new section would be added later.
This patch fixes it.
