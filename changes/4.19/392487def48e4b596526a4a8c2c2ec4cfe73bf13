x86/intel_rdt: Support restoration of subset of permissions

As the mode of a resource group changes, the operations it can support may
also change. One way in which the supported operations are managed is to
modify the permissions of the files within the resource group's resctrl
directory.

At the moment only two possible permissions are supported: the default
permissions or no permissions in support for when the operation is "locked
down". It is possible where an operation on a resource group may have more
possibilities. For example, if by default changes can be made to the
resource group by writing to a resctrl file while the current settings can
be obtained by reading from the file, then it may be possible that in
another mode it is only possible to read the current settings, and not
change them.

Make it possible to modify some of the permissions of a resctrl file in
support of a more flexible way to manage the operations on a resource
group. In this preparation work the original behavior is maintained where
all permissions are restored.
