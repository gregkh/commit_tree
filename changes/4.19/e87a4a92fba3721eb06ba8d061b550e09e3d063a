Revert "arm64: fix infinite stacktrace"

This reverts commit 7e7df71fd57ff2894d96abb0080922bf39460a79.

When unwinding out of the IRQ stack and onto the interrupted EL1 stack,
we cannot rely on the frame pointer being strictly increasing, as this
could terminate the backtrace early depending on how the stacks have
been allocated.
