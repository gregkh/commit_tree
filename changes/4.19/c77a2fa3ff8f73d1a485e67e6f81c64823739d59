scsi: qedi: Add the CRC size within iSCSI NVM image

The QED driver commit, 1ac4329a1cff ("qed: Add configuration information
to register dump and debug data"), removes the CRC length validation
causing nvm_get_image failure while loading qedi driver:

[qed_mcp_get_nvm_image:2700(host_10-0)]Image [0] is too big - 00006008 bytes
where only 00006004 are available
[qedi_get_boot_info:2253]:10: Could not get NVM image. ret = -12

Hence add and adjust the CRC size to iSCSI NVM image to read boot info at
qedi load time.
