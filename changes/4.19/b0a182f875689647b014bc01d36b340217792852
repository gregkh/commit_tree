x86/speculation/l1tf: Fix off-by-one error when warning that system has too much RAM

Two users have reported [1] that they have an "extremely unlikely" system
with more than MAX_PA/2 memory and L1TF mitigation is not effective. In
fact it's a CPU with 36bits phys limit (64GB) and 32GB memory, but due to
holes in the e820 map, the main region is almost 500MB over the 32GB limit:

[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000081effffff] usable

Suggestions to use 'mem=32G' to enable the L1TF mitigation while losing the
500MB revealed, that there's an off-by-one error in the check in
l1tf_select_mitigation().

l1tf_pfn_limit() returns the last usable pfn (inclusive) and the range
check in the mitigation path does not take this into account.

Instead of amending the range check, make l1tf_pfn_limit() return the first
PFN which is over the limit which is less error prone. Adjust the other
users accordingly.
