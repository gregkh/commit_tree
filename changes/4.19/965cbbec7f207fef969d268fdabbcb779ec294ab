net: mvneta: remove data pointer usage from device_node structure

On year ago Rob Herring wanted to remove the data pointer from the
device_node structure[1]. The mvneta driver seemed to be the only one
which used (abused ?) it. However, the proposal of Rob to remove this
pointer from the driver introduced a regression, and I tested and fixed an
alternative way, but it was never submitted as a proper patch.

Now here it is: Instead of using the device_node structure ->data
pointer, we store the BM private data as the driver data of the BM
platform_device. The core mvneta code can retrieve it by doing a lookup
on which platform_device corresponds to the BM device tree node using
of_find_device_by_node(), and get its driver data
