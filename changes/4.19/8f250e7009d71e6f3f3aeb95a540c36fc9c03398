ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add BYT_RT5651_HP_LR_SWAPPED quirk

One some models (Chuwi Vi8 Plus, Chuwi Hi8 Pro) the headphone output has
left and right swapped. This can be fixed in with special mixer settings
in the UCM profile, bit this requires these devices loading a different
UCM profile.

This commit adds a BYT_RT5651_HP_LR_SWAPPED quirk for this and postfixes
the longname with "-hp-swapped" if set, so that a different UCM profile
will be loaded.

We can safely do this without causing regressions (UCM profile not found
due to the longname change) as the UCM profiles are not in upstream
alsa-lib yet.
