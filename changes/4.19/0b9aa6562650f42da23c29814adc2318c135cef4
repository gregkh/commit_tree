x86/intel_rdt: Introduce test to determine if closid is in use

During CAT feature discovery the capacity bitmasks (CBMs) associated
with all the classes of service are initialized to all ones, even if the
class of service is not in use. Introduce a test that can be used to
determine if a class of service is in use. This test enables code
interested in parsing the CBMs to know if its values are meaningful or
can be ignored.

Temporarily mark the function as unused to silence compile warnings
until it is used.
