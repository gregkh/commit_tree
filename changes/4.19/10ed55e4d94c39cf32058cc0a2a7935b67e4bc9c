drm/i915: Initialize panel_pipe to INVALID_PIPE

We can always figure out which pipe is affected by the panel power
sequencer lockout mechanism. So no need for the pipe A fallback
anymore. The only case we may have to worry about is an invalid
port select in the power sequencer, but INVALID_PIPE is just fine
in that case. We'll get the WARN about the bogus pps port select
anyway.
