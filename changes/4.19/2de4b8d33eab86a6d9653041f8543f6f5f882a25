drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: allow active requests from wake TCS

Some RSCs may only have sleep and wake TCS, i.e, there is no dedicated
TCS for active mode request, but drivers may still want to make active
requests from these RSCs. In such cases re-purpose the wake TCS to send
active state requests.

The requirement for this is that the driver is aware that the wake TCS
is being repurposed to send active request, hence the sleep and wake
TCSes be invalidated before the active request is sent.
