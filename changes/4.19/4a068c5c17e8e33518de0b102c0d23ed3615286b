drm/sun4i: DW HDMI: Release nodes if error happens during CRTC search

If error happens in sun8i_dw_hdmi_find_possible_crtcs(), nodes are not
released with of_node_put() before returning.

Fix that by calling of_node_put() when necessary. While on it, clean up
the code by using of_graph_get_remote_node() which also lowers number of
cases where error handling has to be performed.
