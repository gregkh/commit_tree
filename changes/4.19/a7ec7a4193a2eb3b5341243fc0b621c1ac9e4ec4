hfsplus: fix NULL dereference in hfsplus_lookup()

An HFS+ filesystem can be mounted read-only without having a metadata
directory, which is needed to support hardlinks.  But if the catalog
data is corrupted, a directory lookup may still find dentries claiming
to be hardlinks.

hfsplus_lookup() does check that ->hidden_dir is not NULL in such a
situation, but mistakenly does so after dereferencing it for the first
time.  Reorder this check to prevent a crash.

This happens when looking up corrupted catalog data (dentry) on a
filesystem with no metadata directory (this could only ever happen on a
read-only mount).  Wen Xu sent the replication steps in detail to the
fsdevel list: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200297
