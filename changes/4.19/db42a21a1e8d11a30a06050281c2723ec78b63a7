tools: include reallocarray feature test in FEATURE_TESTS_BASIC

perf propagates its feature check results to libbpf.  This means
features for which perf probes must be a superset of libbpf's
required features.  perf depends on FEATURE_TESTS_BASIC for its list
of features.

commit 531b014e7a2f ("tools: bpf: make use of reallocarray") added
reallocarray use to libbpf, make perf also perform the reallocarray
feature check.
