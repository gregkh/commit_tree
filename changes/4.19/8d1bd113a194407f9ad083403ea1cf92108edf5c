ASoC: simple-card: move hp and mic detection to soc_card probe

This patch moves headphone and microphone detection to probe() of
snd_soc_card from init() of snd_soc_dai_link. This is because init()
is called (and an input device /dev/input/eventX is created too)
twice or above if simple card has two or more DAI links.
