btrfs: Exit gracefully when chunk map cannot be inserted to the tree

It's entirely possible that a crafted btrfs image contains overlapping
chunks.

Although we can't detect such problem by tree-checker, it's not a
catastrophic problem, current extent map can already detect such problem
and return -EEXIST.

We just only need to exit gracefully and fail the mount.
