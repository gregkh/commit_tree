fpga: dfl-pci: add enumeration for feature devices

The Device Feature List (DFL) is implemented in MMIO and features
are linked via the DFLs. This patch enables pcie driver to prepare
enumeration information (e.g. locations of all device feature lists
in MMIO) and use common APIs provided by the Device Feature List
framework to enumerate each feature device linked.
