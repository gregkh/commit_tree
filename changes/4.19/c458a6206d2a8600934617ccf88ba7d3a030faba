perf tools: Fix tracing_path_mount proper path

If there's no tracefs (RHEL7) support the tracing_path_mount
returns debugfs path which results in following fail:

  # perf probe sys_write
  kprobe_events file does not exist - please rebuild kernel with CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS.
  Error: Failed to add events.

In tracing_path_debugfs_mount function we need to return the
'tracing' path instead of just the mount to make it work:

  # perf probe sys_write
  Added new event:
    probe:sys_write      (on sys_write)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

          perf record -e probe:sys_write -aR sleep 1

Adding the 'return tracing_path;' also to tracing_path_tracefs_mount
function just for consistency with tracing_path_debugfs_mount.

Upstream keeps working, because it has the tracefs support.
