ARM: dts: imx7d-sdb: Restore pwm backlight support

This was removed in commit 5eaeaccdaedb ("ARM: dts: imx7d-sdb: Pass
'enable-gpios' and 'power-supply' properties") with a note claiming that
GPIO1_IO01 is connected to a pin labeled as "PWREN" on the connector.

Despite that label this pin does actually work as a PWM controlling
brightness. So restore pwm functionality.
