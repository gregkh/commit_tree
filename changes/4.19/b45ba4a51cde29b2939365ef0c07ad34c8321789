powerpc/lib: fix book3s/32 boot failure due to code patching

Commit 51c3c62b58b3 ("powerpc: Avoid code patching freed init
sections") accesses 'init_mem_is_free' flag too early, before the
kernel is relocated. This provokes early boot failure (before the
console is active).

As it is not necessary to do this verification that early, this
patch moves the test into patch_instruction() instead of
__patch_instruction().

This modification also has the advantage of avoiding unnecessary
remappings.
