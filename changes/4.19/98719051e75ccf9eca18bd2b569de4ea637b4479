xfs: refactor internal dfops initialization

The current transaction allocation code conditionally initializes
the ->t_dfops indirection pointer. Transaction commit/cancel check
the validity of the pointer to determine whether to finish/cancel
the internal dfops.

This disallows the ability to use the internal dfops list as a
temporary container (via xfs_trans_alloc_empty()). Refactor
transaction allocation to always initialize ->t_dfops and check
permanent reservation state on transaction commit/cancel.
