vhost_net: Avoid rx queue wake-ups during busypoll

We may run handle_rx() while rx work is queued. For example a packet can
push the rx work during the window before handle_rx calls
vhost_net_disable_vq().
In that case busypoll immediately exits due to vhost_has_work()
condition and enables vq again. This can lead to another unnecessary rx
wake-ups, so poll rx work instead of enabling the vq.
