fpga: region: add compat_id support

This patch introduces a compat_id pointer member and sysfs interface
for each fpga region, similar as compat_id for fpga manager, it allows
applications to read the per region compat_id for compatibility
checking before other actions on this fpga-region (e.g. PR).
