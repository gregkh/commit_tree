scsi: tcmu: simplify nl interface

Just return EBUSY if a nl request comes in while processing one. The upper
layers do not support sending multiple create/remove requests at the same
time (you cannot have a create and remove at the same time or do multiple
creates or removes at the same time) and doing a reconfig while a
create/remove is still executing does not make sense.
