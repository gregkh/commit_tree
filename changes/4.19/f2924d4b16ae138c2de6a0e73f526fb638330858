usb: cdc_acm: Do not leak URB buffers

When the ACM TTY port is disconnected, the URBs it uses must be killed, and
then the buffers must be freed. Unfortunately a previous refactor removed
the code freeing the buffers because it looked extremely similar to the
code killing the URBs.

As a result, there were many new leaks for each plug/unplug cycle of a
CDC-ACM device, that were detected by kmemleak.

Restore the missing code, and the memory leak is removed.
