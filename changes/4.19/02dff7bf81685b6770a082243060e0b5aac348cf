xfs: pull up dfops from xfs_itruncate_extents()

xfs_itruncate_extents[_flags]() uses a local dfops with a
transaction provided by the caller. It uses hacky ->t_dfops
replacement logic to avoid stomping over an already populated
->t_dfops.

The latter never occurs for current callers and the logic itself is
not really appropriate. Clean this up by updating all callers to
initialize a dfops and to use that down in xfs_itruncate_extents().
This more closely resembles the upcoming logic where dfops will be
embedded within the transaction. We can also replace the
xfs_defer_init() in the xfs_itruncate_extents_flags() loop with an
assert. Both dfops and firstblock should be in a valid state
after xfs_defer_finish() and the inode joined to the dfops is fixed
throughout the loop.
