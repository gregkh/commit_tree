staging:rtl8192u: Remove member reserved - Style

The structure dynamic_rx_path_sel contains a u8 member variable called
reserved. This member variable is never actually used in the code.

The naming suggests that the sizeof the structure is significant but
the only use of the structure is a local static in r8192U_dm.c:

static struct dynamic_rx_path_sel DM_RxPathSelTable;

There is no apparent significance to the sizeof the declared structure
DM_RxPathSelTable. As a result the reserved member variable has been
removed from the structure.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
