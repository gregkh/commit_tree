hwmon: (nct6775) Fix access to fan pulse registers

Not all fans have a fan pulse register. This can result in reading
beyond the end of REG_FAN_PULSES and FAN_PULSE_SHIFT arrays,
and was reported by smatch as possible error.

1672          for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(data->rpm); i++) {
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
			      This is a 7 element array.
...
1685                  data->fan_pulses[i] =
1686                    (nct6775_read_value(data, data->REG_FAN_PULSES[i])
1687                          >> data->FAN_PULSE_SHIFT[i]) & 0x03;
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
				 FAN_PULSE_SHIFT is either 5 or 6
				 elements.

To fix the problem, we have to ensure that all REG_FAN_PULSES and
FAN_PULSE_SHIFT have the appropriate length, and that REG_FAN_PULSES
is only read if the register actually exists.
