mei: fix ssize_t to int assignment in read and write ops.

Use ssize_t for rets variables in mei_write(), mei_read(), and
mei_cl_write() as well as change the return type of mei_cl_write()
to ssize_t, to prevent assignment of possible 64bit size_t
to int 32 bit variable.

As by product also eliminate warning
drivers/misc/mei/client.c:1702:11: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]
