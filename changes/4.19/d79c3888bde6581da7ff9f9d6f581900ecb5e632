net: ena: fix warning in rmmod caused by double iounmap

Memory mapped with devm_ioremap is automatically freed when the driver
is disconnected from the device. Therefore there is no need to
explicitly call devm_iounmap.

Fixes: 411838e7b41c ("net: ena: fix rare kernel crash when bar memory remap fails")
