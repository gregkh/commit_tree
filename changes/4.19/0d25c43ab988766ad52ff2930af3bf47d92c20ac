samples/bpf: extend xdp_rxq_info to read packet payload

There is a cost associated with reading the packet data payload
that this test ignored.  Add option --read to allow enabling
reading part of the payload.

This sample/tool helps us analyse an issue observed with a NIC
mlx5 (ConnectX-5 Ex) and an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v4.

With no_touch of data:

Running XDP on dev:mlx5p1 (ifindex:8) action:XDP_DROP options:no_touch
XDP stats       CPU     pps         issue-pps
XDP-RX CPU      0       14,465,157  0
XDP-RX CPU      1       14,464,728  0
XDP-RX CPU      2       14,465,283  0
XDP-RX CPU      3       14,465,282  0
XDP-RX CPU      4       14,464,159  0
XDP-RX CPU      5       14,465,379  0
XDP-RX CPU      total   86,789,992

When not touching data, we observe that the CPUs have idle cycles.
When reading data the CPUs are 100% busy in softirq.

With reading data:

Running XDP on dev:mlx5p1 (ifindex:8) action:XDP_DROP options:read
XDP stats       CPU     pps         issue-pps
XDP-RX CPU      0       9,620,639   0
XDP-RX CPU      1       9,489,843   0
XDP-RX CPU      2       9,407,854   0
XDP-RX CPU      3       9,422,289   0
XDP-RX CPU      4       9,321,959   0
XDP-RX CPU      5       9,395,242   0
XDP-RX CPU      total   56,657,828

The effect seen above is a result of cache-misses occuring when
more RXQs are being used.  Based on perf-event observations, our
conclusion is that the CPUs DDIO (Direct Data I/O) choose to
deliver packet into main memory, instead of L3-cache.  We also
found, that this can be mitigated by either using less RXQs or by
reducing NICs the RX-ring size.
