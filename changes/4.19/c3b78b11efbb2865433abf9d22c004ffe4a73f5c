mm, oom: describe task memory unit, larger PID pad

The default page memory unit of OOM task dump events might not be
intuitive and potentially misleading for the non-initiated when debugging
OOM events: These are pages and not kBs.  Add a small printk prior to the
task dump informing that the memory units are actually memory _pages_.

Also extends PID field to align on up to 7 characters.
