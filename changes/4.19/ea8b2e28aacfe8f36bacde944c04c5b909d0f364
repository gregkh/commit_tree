mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Implement priority setting for rules inserted to TCAM

For Spectrum-2, we need to insert priority to C-TCAM because HW
needs that info in order to correctly process scenarios where rules
are in both C-TCAM and A-TCAM.

So extend the mlxsw_sp_acl_ctcam_entry_add() args to accept indication
if priority needs to be filled up and implement the priority
computation and fill-up.
