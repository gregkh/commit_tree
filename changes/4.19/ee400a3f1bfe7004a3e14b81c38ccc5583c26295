e1000: ensure to free old tx/rx rings in set_ringparam()

In 'e1000_set_ringparam()', the tx_ring and rx_ring are updated with new value
and the old tx/rx rings are freed only when the device is up. There are resource
leaks on old tx/rx rings when the device is not up. This bug is reported by COD,
a tool for testing kernel module binaries I am building.

This patch fixes the bug by always calling 'kfree()' on old tx/rx rings in
'e1000_set_ringparam()'.
