drm: add support for DisplayPort CEC-Tunneling-over-AUX

This adds support for the DisplayPort CEC-Tunneling-over-AUX
feature that is part of the DisplayPort 1.3 standard.

Unfortunately, not all DisplayPort/USB-C to HDMI adapters with a
chip that has this capability actually hook up the CEC pin, so
even though a CEC device is created, it may not actually work.
