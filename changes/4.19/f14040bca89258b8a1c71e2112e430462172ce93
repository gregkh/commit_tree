KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix guest r11 corruption with POWER9 TM workarounds

When we come into the softpatch handler (0x1500), we use r11 to store
the HSRR0 for later use by the denorm handler.

We also use the softpatch handler for the TM workarounds for
POWER9. Unfortunately, in kvmppc_interrupt_hv we later store r11 out
to the vcpu assuming it's still what we got from userspace.

This causes r11 to be corrupted in the VCPU and hence when we restore
the guest, we get a corrupted r11. We've seen this when running TM
tests inside guests on P9.

This fixes the problem by only touching r11 in the denorm case.
