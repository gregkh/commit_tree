llc: set SOCK_RCU_FREE in llc_sap_add_socket()

WHen an llc sock is added into the sk_laddr_hash of an llc_sap,
it is not marked with SOCK_RCU_FREE.

This causes that the sock could be freed while it is still being
read by __llc_lookup_established() with RCU read lock. sock is
refcounted, but with RCU read lock, nothing prevents the readers
getting a zero refcnt.

Fix it by setting SOCK_RCU_FREE in llc_sap_add_socket().
