qed: Do not add VLAN 0 tag to untagged frames in multi-function mode.

In certain multi-function switch dependent modes, firmware adds vlan tag 0
to the untagged frames. This leads to double tagging for the traffic
if the dcbx is enabled, which is not the desired behavior. To avoid this,
driver needs to set "dcb_dont_add_vlan0" flag.
