xsk: do not call synchronize_net() under RCU read lock

The XSKMAP update and delete functions called synchronize_net(), which
can sleep. It is not allowed to sleep during an RCU read section.

Instead we need to make sure that the sock sk_destruct (xsk_destruct)
function is asynchronously called after an RCU grace period. Setting
the SOCK_RCU_FREE flag for XDP sockets takes care of this.
