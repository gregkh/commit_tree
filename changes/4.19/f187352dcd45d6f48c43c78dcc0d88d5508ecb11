media: i2c: Copy rj54n1cb0c soc_camera sensor driver

Copy the soc_camera based driver in v4l2 sensor driver directory.
This commit just copies the original file without modifying it.
No modification to KConfig and Makefile as soc_camera framework
dependencies need to be removed first in next commit.
