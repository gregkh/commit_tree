i40iw: Reorganize acquire/release of locks in i40iw_manage_apbvt

Commit f43c00c04bbf ("i40iw: Extend port reuse support for listeners")
introduces a sparse warning:

include/linux/spinlock.h:365:9: sparse: context imbalance in
'i40iw_manage_apbvt' - unexpected unlock

Fix this by reorganizing the acquire/release of locks in
i40iw_manage_apbvt and add a new function i40iw_cqp_manage_abvpt_cmd
to perform the CQP command. Also, use __clear_bit and __test_and_set_bit
as we do not need atomic versions.
