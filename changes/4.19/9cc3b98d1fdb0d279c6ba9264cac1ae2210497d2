sunrpc: remove redundant variables 'checksumlen','blocksize' and 'data'

Variables 'checksumlen','blocksize' and 'data' are being assigned,
but are never used, hence they are redundant and can be removed.

Fix the following warning:

  net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_krb5_wrap.c:443:7: warning: variable ‘blocksize’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_krb5_crypto.c:376:15: warning: variable ‘checksumlen’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/svc_rdma.c:97:9: warning: variable ‘data’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
