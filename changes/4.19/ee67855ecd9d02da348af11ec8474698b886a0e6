MIPS: vdso: Allow clang's --target flag in VDSO cflags

The MIPS VDSO code filters out a subset of known-good flags from
KBUILD_CFLAGS to use when building VDSO libraries. When we build using
clang we need to allow the --target flag through, otherwise we'll
generally attempt to build the VDSO for the architecture of the build
machine rather than for MIPS.
