drm/omap: gem: Fix mm_list locking

- None of the list walkings where protected.

- Switch to a mutex since the list walking at device resume time can
  sleep when pinning buffers through the tiler.

Only thing we need to be careful with here is that while we walk the
list we can't unreference any gem objects, since the final unref would
result in a recursive deadlock. But the only functions that walk the
list is the device resume and debugfs dumping, so all safe.
