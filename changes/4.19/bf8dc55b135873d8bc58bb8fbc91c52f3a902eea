xen/gntdev: Implement dma-buf import functionality

1. Import a dma-buf with the file descriptor provided and export
   granted references to the pages of that dma-buf into the array
   of grant references.

2. Add API to close all references to an imported buffer, so it can be
   released by the owner. This is only valid for buffers created with
   IOCTL_GNTDEV_DMABUF_IMP_TO_REFS.
