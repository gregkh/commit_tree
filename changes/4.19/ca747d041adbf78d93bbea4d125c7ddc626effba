media: dvb-frontends/tda18271c2dd: fix handling of DVB-T parameters

Add a break statement in set_params() for the SYS_DVBT(2).

As reported by gcc:

    drivers/media/dvb-frontends/tda18271c2dd.c:1144:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

There is a nested switch() inside the code with sets the tuner to
the right standard. Without the break, the code will always set to
DVB-C mode, with can be sub-optimal for DVB-T.
