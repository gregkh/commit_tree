ARM: OMAP1: Get rid of <mach/ams-delta-fiq.h>

Split the header file into two parts and move them to directories where
they belong.

Information on internal structure of FIQ buffer is moved to
<linux/platform_data/ams-delta-fiq.h> for ams-delta-serio driver use.

Other information used by ams-delta board init file and FIQ code is
made local to mach-omap1 root directory.
