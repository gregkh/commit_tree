NFC: Fix the number of pipes

According to ETSI TS 102 622 specification chapter 4.4 pipe identifier
is 7 bits long which allows for 128 unique pipe IDs. Because
NFC_HCI_MAX_PIPES is used as the number of pipes supported and not
as the max pipe ID, its value should be 128 instead of 127.

nfc_hci_recv_from_llc extracts pipe ID from packet header using
NFC_HCI_FRAGMENT(0x7F) mask which allows for pipe ID value of 127.
Same happens when NCI_HCP_MSG_GET_PIPE() is being used. With
pipes array having only 127 elements and pipe ID of 127 the OOB memory
access will result.
