drm/i915: Remove pci private pointer after destroying the device private

On an aborted module load, we unwind and free our device private - but
we left a dangling pointer to our privates inside the pci_device. After
the attempted aborted unload, we may still get a call to i915_pci_remove()
when the module is removed, potentially chasing stale data.
