ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Add DSP setup defaults for Recon3D

The Recon3D can use many of the same functions as the Recon3Di, so many
of the r3di prefix function remain the same, but change their names to
the more generic r3d prefix. This patch does this, and adds quirk checks
for things specific to the Recon3Di.
