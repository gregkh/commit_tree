MIPS: Loongson: Set Loongson32 to MIPS32R1

LS232 (Loonson 2-issue 32-bit, also called GS232 (Godson 2-issue 32-bit))
is the CPU core (microarchitecture) of Loongson 1A/1B/1C.

According to "LS232 用户手册 (LS232 User Manual)", LS232 implements the
MIPS32 Release 1 instruction set, and part of the MIPS32 Release 2
instruction set.

In the manual, LS232 implements all of the MIPS32R2 instruction set
except the FPU instructions, and LS232 also implements 5 FPU
instructions of the MIPS32R2 instruction set: CEIL.L.fmt, CVT.L.fmt,
FLOOR.L.fmt, TRUNC.L.fmt, and ROUND.L.fmt.

But a bug of the DI instruction has been found during tests, the DI
instruction can not disable interrupts in arch_local_irq_disable() with
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y and CFLAGS='-mno-branch-likely' in some cases.

[paul.burton@mips.com:
  - Remove the _MIPS_ISA redefinition to match the change made for the
    generic MIPSr1 CPUs by commit 344ebf09949c ("MIPS: Always use
    -march=<arch>, not -<arch> shortcuts").]
