x86/intel_rdt: Create character device exposing pseudo-locked region

After a pseudo-locked region is created it needs to be made
available to user space for usage.

A character device supporting mmap() is created for each pseudo-locked
region. A user space application can now use mmap() system call to map
pseudo-locked region into its virtual address space.
