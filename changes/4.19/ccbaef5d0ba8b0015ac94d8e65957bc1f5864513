misc: genwqe: remove several redundant variables

The variables val16, type, pci_dev and type are set but are never used
hence they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'type' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'val16' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'pci_dev' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'type' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
