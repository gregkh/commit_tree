xfs: zero posteof blocks when cloning above eof

When we're reflinking between two files and the destination file range
is well beyond the destination file's EOF marker, zero any posteof
speculative preallocations in the destination file so that we don't
expose stale disk contents.  The previous strategy of trying to clear
the preallocations does not work if the destination file has the
PREALLOC flag set.
