tls: Fix improper revert in zerocopy_from_iter

The current code is problematic because the iov_iter is reverted and
never advanced in the non-error case. This patch skips the revert in the
non-error case. This patch also fixes the amount by which the iov_iter
is reverted. Currently, iov_iter is reverted by size, which can be
greater than the amount by which the iter was actually advanced.
Instead, only revert by the amount that the iter was advanced.
