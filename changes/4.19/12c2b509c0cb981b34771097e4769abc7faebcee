remoteproc: qcom: fix Q6V5_WCSS dependencies

A new driver got added that depends on QCOM_SMD and fails to link
as built-in with CONFIG_QCOM_SMD=m:

drivers/remoteproc/qcom_common.o: In function `smd_subdev_stop':
qcom_common.c:(.text+0x674): undefined reference to `qcom_smd_unregister_edge'
drivers/remoteproc/qcom_common.o: In function `smd_subdev_start':
qcom_common.c:(.text+0x700): undefined reference to `qcom_smd_register_edge'

We've fixed the same thing several times before, so use the same
dependency here.
