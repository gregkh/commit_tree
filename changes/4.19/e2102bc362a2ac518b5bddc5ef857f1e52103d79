staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef of cmpk_set_cfg_t - Style

Remove the typedef from cmpk_set_cfg_t, leaving the structure as
struct cmd_pkt_set_configuration. This change clears the checkpatch
issue with defining new types. The change is purely a coding
style change which should have no impact on runtime code execution.
