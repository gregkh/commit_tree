arm64: fix erroneous warnings in page freeing functions

In pmd_free_pte_page() and pud_free_pmd_page() we try to warn if they
hit a present non-table entry. In both cases we'll warn for non-present
entries, as the VM_WARN_ON() only checks the entry is not a table entry.

This has been observed to result in warnings when booting a v4.19-rc2
kernel under qemu.

Fix this by bailing out earlier for non-present entries.
