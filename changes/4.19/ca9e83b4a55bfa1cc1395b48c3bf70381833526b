virtio-net: correctly update XDP_TX counters

Commit 5b8f3c8d30a6 ("virtio_net: Add XDP related stats") tries to
count TX XDP stats in virtnet_receive(). This will cause several
issues:

- virtnet_xdp_sq() was called without checking whether or not XDP is
  set. This may cause out of bound access when there's no enough txq
  for XDP.
- Stats were updated even if there's no XDP/XDP_TX.

Fixing this by reusing virtnet_xdp_xmit() for XDP_TX which can counts
TX XDP counter itself and remove the unnecessary tx stats embedded in
rx stats.
