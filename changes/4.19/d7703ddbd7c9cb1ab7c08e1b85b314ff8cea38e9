net: ena: fix rare bug when failed restart/resume is followed by driver removal

In a rare scenario when ena_device_restore() fails, followed by device
remove, an FLR will not be issued. In this case, the device will keep
sending asynchronous AENQ keep-alive events, even after driver removal,
leading to memory corruption.
