locking/lockdep: Delete unnecessary #include

Commit:

  c3bc8fd637a9 ("tracing: Centralize preemptirq tracepoints and unify their usage")

added the inclusion of <trace/events/preemptirq.h>.

liblockdep doesn't have a stub version of that header so now fails to build.

However, commit:

  bff1b208a5d1 ("tracing: Partial revert of "tracing: Centralize preemptirq tracepoints and unify their usage"")

removed the use of functions declared in that header. So delete the #include.
