btrfs: relocation: Only remove reloc rb_trees if reloc control has been initialized

Invalid reloc tree can cause kernel NULL pointer dereference when btrfs
does some cleanup of the reloc roots.

It turns out that fs_info::reloc_ctl can be NULL in
btrfs_recover_relocation() as we allocate relocation control after all
reloc roots have been verified.
So when we hit: note, we haven't called set_reloc_control() thus
fs_info::reloc_ctl is still NULL.
