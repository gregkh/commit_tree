spi: sh-msiof: Fix invalid SPI use during system suspend

If the SPI queue is running during system suspend, the system may lock
up.

Fix this by stopping/restarting the queue during system suspend/resume
by calling spi_master_suspend()/spi_master_resume() from the PM
callbacks.  In-kernel users will receive an -ESHUTDOWN error while
system suspend/resume is in progress.
