Revert "mm: always flush VMA ranges affected by zap_page_range"

There was a bug in Linux that could cause madvise (and mprotect?) system
calls to return to userspace without the TLB having been flushed for all
the pages involved.

This could happen when multiple threads of a process made simultaneous
madvise and/or mprotect calls.

This was noticed in the summer of 2017, at which time two solutions
were created:

  56236a59556c ("mm: refactor TLB gathering API")
  99baac21e458 ("mm: fix MADV_[FREE|DONTNEED] TLB flush miss problem")
and
  4647706ebeee ("mm: always flush VMA ranges affected by zap_page_range")

We need only one of these solutions, and the former appears to be a
little more efficient than the latter, so revert that one.

This reverts 4647706ebeee6e50 ("mm: always flush VMA ranges affected by
zap_page_range")
