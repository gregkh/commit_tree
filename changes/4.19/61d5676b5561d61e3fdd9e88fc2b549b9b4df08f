drm/i915/perf: fix ctx_id read with GuC & ICL

One thing we didn't really understand about the OA report is that the
ContextID field (dword 2) is copy of the context descriptor (dword 1).

On Gen8->10 and without using GuC we didn't notice the issue because
we only checked the 21bits of the ContextID field in the OA reports
which matches exactly the hw_id stored into the context descriptor.

When using GuC submission we have an issue of a non matching hw_id
because GuC uses bit 20 of the hw_id to signal proxy submission. This
change introduces a mask to compare only the relevant bits.

On ICL the context descriptor format has changed and we failed to
address this. On top of using a mask we also need to shift the bits
properly.

v2: Reuse lrc_desc rather than recomputing part of it (Chris/Michel)

v3: Always pin the context we're filtering with (Chris)
