MIPS: genvdso: Remove GOT checks

Our genvdso tool performs some rather paranoid checking that the VDSO
library isn't attempting to make use of a GOT by constraining the number
of entries that the GOT is allowed to contain to the minimum 2 entries
that are always generated by binutils.

Unfortunately lld prior to revision 334390 generates a third entry,
which is unused & thus harmless but falls foul of genvdso's checks &
causes the build to fail.

Since we already check that the VDSO contains no relocations it seems
reasonable to presume that it also doesn't contain use of a GOT, which
would involve relocations. Thus rather than attempting to work around
this issue by allowing 3 GOT entries when using lld, simply remove the
GOT checks which seem overly paranoid.
