mtd: rawnand: denali: fix a race condition when DMA is kicked

I thought the read-back of the DMA_ENABLE register was unnecessary
(at least it is working on my boards), then deleted it in commit
586a2c52909d ("mtd: nand: denali: squash denali_enable_dma() helper
into caller").  Sorry, I was wrong - it caused a timing issue on
Cyclone5 SoCFPGAs.

Revive the register read-back, commenting why this is necessary.
