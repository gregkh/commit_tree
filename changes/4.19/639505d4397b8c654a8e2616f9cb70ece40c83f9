net/mlx5: Fix SQ offset in QPs with small RQ

Correct the formula for calculating the RQ page remainder,
which should be in byte granularity.  The result will be
non-zero only for RQs smaller than PAGE_SIZE, as an RQ size
is a power of 2.

Divide this by the SQ stride (MLX5_SEND_WQE_BB) to get the
SQ offset in strides granularity.
