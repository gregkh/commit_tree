KVM: Switch 'requests' to be 64-bit (explicitly)

Switch 'requests' to be explicitly 64-bit and update BUILD_BUG_ON check to
use the size of "requests" instead of the hard-coded '32'.

That gives us a bit more room again for arch-specific requests as we
already ran out of space for x86 due to the hard-coded check.

The only exception here is ARM32 as it is still 32-bits.
