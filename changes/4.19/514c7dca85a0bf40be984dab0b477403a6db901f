btrfs: Check that each block group has corresponding chunk at mount time

A crafted btrfs image with incorrect chunk<->block group mapping will
trigger a lot of unexpected things as the mapping is essential.

Although the problem can be caught by block group item checker
added in "btrfs: tree-checker: Verify block_group_item", it's still not
sufficient.  A sufficiently valid block group item can pass the check
added by the mentioned patch but could fail to match the existing chunk.

This patch will add extra block group -> chunk mapping check, to ensure
we have a completely matching (start, len, flags) chunk for each block
group at mount time.

Here we reuse the original helper find_first_block_group(), which is
already doing the basic bg -> chunk checks, adding further checks of the
start/len and type flags.
