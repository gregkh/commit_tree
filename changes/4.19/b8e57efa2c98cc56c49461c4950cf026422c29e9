mm/vmscan.c: fix int overflow in callers of do_shrink_slab()

do_shrink_slab() returns unsigned long value, and the placing into int
variable cuts high bytes off.  Then we compare ret and 0xfffffffe (since
SHRINK_EMPTY is converted to ret type).

Thus a large number of objects returned by do_shrink_slab() may be
interpreted as SHRINK_EMPTY, if low bytes of their value are equal to
0xfffffffe.  Fix that by declaration ret as unsigned long in these
functions.
