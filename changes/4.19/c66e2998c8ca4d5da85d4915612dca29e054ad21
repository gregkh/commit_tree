nvme-rdma: centralize controller setup sequence

Centralize controller sequence to a single routine that correctly cleans
up after failures instead of having multiple apperances in several flows
(create, reset, reconnect).

One thing that we also gain here are the sanity/boundary checks also
when connecting back to a dynamic controller.
