crypto: dh - add public key verification test

According to SP800-56A section 5.6.2.1, the public key to be processed
for the DH operation shall be checked for appropriateness. The check
shall covers the full verification test in case the domain parameter Q
is provided as defined in SP800-56A section 5.6.2.3.1. If Q is not
provided, the partial check according to SP800-56A section 5.6.2.3.2 is
performed.

The full verification test requires the presence of the domain parameter
Q. Thus, the patch adds the support to handle Q. It is permissible to
not provide the Q value as part of the domain parameters. This implies
that the interface is still backwards-compatible where so far only P and
G are to be provided. However, if Q is provided, it is imported.

Without the test, the NIST ACVP testing fails. After adding this check,
the NIST ACVP testing passes. Testing without providing the Q domain
parameter has been performed to verify the interface has not changed.
