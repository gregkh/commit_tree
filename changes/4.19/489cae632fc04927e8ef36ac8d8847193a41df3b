include: Move ascii85 functions from i915 to linux/ascii85.h

The i915 DRM driver very cleverly used ascii85 encoding for their
GPU state file. Move the encode functions to a general header file to
support other drivers that might be interested in the same
functionality.

v4: Make the return value const char * as suggested by Chris Wilson
v3: Fix error_puts -> err_puts pointed out by the 01.org bot
v2: Update API to be cleaner for the caller as suggested by Chris Wilson
