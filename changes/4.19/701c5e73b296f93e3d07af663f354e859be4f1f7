serial: 8250_dw: add fractional divisor support

For Synopsys DesignWare 8250 uart which version >= 4.00a, there's a
valid divisor latch fraction register. The fractional divisor width is
4bits ~ 6bits.

Now the preparation is done, it's easy to add the feature support.
This patch firstly tries to get the fractional divisor width during
probe, then setups dw specific get_divisor() and set_divisor() hook.
