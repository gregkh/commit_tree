watchdog: Reduce message verbosity

Code is emitting the following error message during boot on systems
without PMU hardware support while probing NMI capability.

 NMI watchdog: Perf event create on CPU 0 failed with -2

This error is emitted as the perf subsystem returns -ENOENT due to lack of
PMUs in the system.

It is followed by the warning that NMI watchdog is disabled:

  NMI watchdog: Perf NMI watchdog permanently disabled

While NMI disabled information is useful for ordinary users, seeing a PERF
event create failed with error code -2 is not.

Reduce the message severity to debug so that if debugging is still possible
in case the error code returned by perf is required for analysis.
