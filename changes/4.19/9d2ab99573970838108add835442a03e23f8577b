ata: libahci_platform: add reset control support

Add support to get and control a list of resets for the device
as optional and shared. These resets must be kept de-asserted until
the device is enabled.

This is specified as shared because some SoCs like UniPhier series
have common reset controls with all ahci controller instances.

However, according to Thierry's view,
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ide/msg55357.html
some hardware-specific drivers already use their own resets,
and the common reset make a path to occur double controls of resets.

The ahci_platform_get_resources() can get and control the reset
only when the second argument includes AHCI_PLATFORM_GET_RESETS bit.
