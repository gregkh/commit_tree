ipv6: icmp: Updating pmtu for link local route

When a ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG is received from a link local address the pmtu will
be updated on a route with an arbitrary interface index. Subsequent packets
sent back to the same link local address may therefore end up not
considering the updated pmtu.

Current behavior breaks TAHI v6LC4.1.4 Reduce PMTU On-link. Referring to RFC
1981: Section 3: "Note that Path MTU Discovery must be performed even in
cases where a node "thinks" a destination is attached to the same link as
itself. In a situation such as when a neighboring router acts as proxy [ND]
for some destination, the destination can to appear to be directly
connected but is in fact more than one hop away."

Using the interface index from the incoming ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG when updating
the pmtu.
