rcu: Remove "inline" from rcu_torture_print_module_parms()

This function is in rcutorture.c, which is not an include file, so there
is no problem dropping the "inline", especially given that this function
is invoked only twice per rcutorture run.  This commit therefore delegates
the inlining decision to the compiler by dropping the "inline".
