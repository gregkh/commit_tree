tools/testing/selftests/vm/: add MAP_POPULATE test

As with many other projects, we use some shmalloc allocator.  At some
point we need to make a part of allocated pages back private to process.
And it should be populated straight away.  Check that (MAP_PRIVATE |
MAP_POPULATE) actually copies the private page.
