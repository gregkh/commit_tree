mmc: sunxi: remove output of virtual base address

Recent Linux versions refuse to print actual virtual kernel addresses,
to not give a hint about the location of the kernel in a randomized virtual
address space. This affects the output of the sunxi MMC controller
driver, which now produces the rather uninformative line:

[    1.482660] sunxi-mmc 1c0f000.mmc: base:0x(____ptrval____) irq:8

Since the virtual base address is not really interesting in the first
place, let's just drop this value. The same applies to Linux' notion of
the interrupt number, which is independent from the GIC SPI number.
We have the physical address as part of the DT node name, which is way
more useful for debugging purposes.
To keep a success message in the driver, we make this purpose explicit
with the word "initialized", plus print some information that is not too
obvious and that we learned while probing the device:
the maximum request size and whether it uses the new timing mode.
So the output turns into:
[    1.750626] sunxi-mmc 1c0f000.mmc: initialized, max. request size: 16384 KB, uses new timings mode
[    1.786699] sunxi-mmc 1c11000.mmc: initialized, max. request size: 2048 KB
