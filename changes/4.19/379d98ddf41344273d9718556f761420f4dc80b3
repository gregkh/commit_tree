x86: vdso: Use $LD instead of $CC to link

The vdso{32,64}.so can fail to link with CC=clang when clang tries to find
a suitable GCC toolchain to link these libraries with.

/usr/bin/ld: arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.o:
  access beyond end of merged section (782)

This happens because the host environment leaked into the cross compiler
environment due to the way clang searches for suitable GCC toolchains.

Clang is a retargetable compiler, and each invocation of it must provide
--target=<something> --gcc-toolchain=<something> to allow it to find the
correct binutils for cross compilation. These flags had been added to
KBUILD_CFLAGS, but the vdso code uses CC and not KBUILD_CFLAGS (for various
reasons) which breaks clang's ability to find the correct linker when cross
compiling.

Most of the time this goes unnoticed because the host linker is new enough
to work anyway, or is incompatible and skipped, but this cannot be reliably
assumed.

This change alters the vdso makefile to just use LD directly, which
bypasses clang and thus the searching problem. The makefile will just use
${CROSS_COMPILE}ld instead, which is always what we want. This matches the
method used to link vmlinux.

This drops references to DISABLE_LTO; this option doesn't seem to be set
anywhere, and not knowing what its possible values are, it's not clear how
to convert it from CC to LD flag.
