sysfs, kobject: allow creating kobject belonging to arbitrary users

Normally kobjects and their sysfs representation belong to global root,
however it is not necessarily the case for objects in separate namespaces.
For example, objects in separate network namespace logically belong to the
container's root and not global root.

This change lays groundwork for allowing network namespace objects
ownership to be transferred to container's root user by defining
get_ownership() callback in ktype structure and using it in sysfs code to
retrieve desired uid/gid when creating sysfs objects for given kobject.
