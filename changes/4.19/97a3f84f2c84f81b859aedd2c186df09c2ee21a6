net_sched: remove unnecessary ops->delete()

All ops->delete() wants is getting the tn->idrinfo, but we already
have tc_action before calling ops->delete(), and tc_action has
a pointer ->idrinfo.

More importantly, each type of action does the same thing, that is,
just calling tcf_idr_delete_index().

So it can be just removed.
