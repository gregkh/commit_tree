Fix cg_read_strcmp()

Fix a couple issues with cg_read_strcmp(), to improve correctness of
cgroup tests
- Fix cg_read_strcmp() always returning 0 for empty "needle" strings.
Previously, this function read to a size = 1 buffer when comparing
against empty strings, which would lead to cg_read_strcmp() comparing
two empty strings.
- Fix a memory leak in cg_read_strcmp()
