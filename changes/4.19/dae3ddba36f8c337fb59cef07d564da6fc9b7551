cdc-acm: do not reset notification buffer index upon urb unlinking

Resetting the write index of the notification buffer on urb unlink (e.g.
closing a cdc-acm device from userspace) may lead to wrong interpretation
of further received notifications, in case the index is not 0 when urb
unlink happens (i.e. when parts of a notification already have been
transferred). On the device side there is no "reset" of the notification
transimission and thus we would get out of sync with the device.
