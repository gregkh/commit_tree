mlxsw: spectrum_kvdl: Push out KVD linear management into ops

In Spectrum-2 there is a different implementation of KVD linear
management. Unlike in Spectrum where there is a single index space,
in Spectrum-2 the indexes are per-resource. Also there is need to
explicitly tell HW that an entry is no longer used.
So push out the existing implementation into spectrum1_kvdl.c and
prepare ops infrastructure to allow new implementation in a follow-up.
