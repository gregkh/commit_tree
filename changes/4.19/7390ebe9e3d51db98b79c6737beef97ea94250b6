staging:rtl8192u: Rename tspec_body members - Style

The member variables of the tspec_body have been renamed to clear the
checkpatch issue with CamelCase naming. As these member variables are
never used in the code the changes are combined into this single
patch.

These changes are coding style changes which should have no impact on
runtime code execution.
