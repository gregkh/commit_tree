net: allow fallback function to pass netdev

For most of these calls we can just pass NULL through to the fallback
function as the sb_dev. The only cases where we cannot are the cases where
we might be dealing with either an upper device or a driver that would
have configured things to support an sb_dev itself.

The only driver that has any significant change in this patch set should be
ixgbe as we can drop the redundant functionality that existed in both the
ndo_select_queue function and the fallback function that was passed through
to us.
