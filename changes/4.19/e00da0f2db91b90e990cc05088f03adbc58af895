powerpc/powernv: opal-kmsg use flush fallback from console code

Use the more refined and tested event polling loop from opal_put_chars
as the fallback console flush in the opal-kmsg path. This loop is used
by the console driver today, whereas the opal-kmsg fallback is not
likely to have been used for years.

Use WARN_ONCE rather than a printk when the fallback is invoked to
prepare for moving the console flush into a common function.
