x86/intel_rdt: Enable entering of pseudo-locksetup mode

The user can request entering pseudo-locksetup mode by writing
"pseudo-locksetup" to the mode file. Act on this request as well as
support switching from a pseudo-locksetup mode (before pseudo-locked
mode was entered). It is not supported to modify the mode once
pseudo-locked mode has been entered.

The schemata reflects the new mode by adding "uninitialized" to all
resources. The size resctrl file reports zero for all cache domains in
support of the uninitialized nature. Since there are no users of this
class of service its allocations can be ignored when searching for
appropriate default allocations for new resource groups. For the same
reason resource groups in pseudo-locksetup mode are not considered when
testing if new resource groups may overlap.
