blk-wbt: fix IO hang in wbt_wait()

On wbt invariant is that if one IO is tracked via WBT_TRACKED, rqw->inflight
should be updated for tracking this IO.

But commit c1c80384c8f ("block: remove external dependency on wbt_flags")
forgets to remove the early handling of !rwb_enabled(rwb) inside wbt_wait(),
then the inflight counter may not be increased in wbt_wait(), but decreased
in wbt_done() for this kind of IO, so this counter may become negative, then
wbt_wait() may wait forever.

This patch fixes the report in the following link:
