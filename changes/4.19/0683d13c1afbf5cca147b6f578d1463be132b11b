perf annotate: Get rid of annotation__scnprintf_samples_period()

We have more current function tto get the title for annotation,
which is hists__scnprintf_title. They both have same output as
far as the annotation's header line goes.

They differ in counting of the nr_samples, hists__scnprintf_title
provides more accurate number based on the setup of the
symbol_conf.filter_relative variable.

Plus it also displays any uid/thread/dso/socket filters/zooms
if there are set any, which annotation__scnprintf_samples_period
does not.
