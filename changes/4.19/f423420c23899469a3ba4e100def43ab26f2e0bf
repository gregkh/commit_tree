fat: propagate 64-bit inode timestamps

Now that we pass down 64-bit timestamps from VFS, we just need to convert
that correctly into on-disk timestamps.  To make that work correctly, this
changes the last use of time_to_tm() in the kernel to time64_to_tm(),
which also lets use remove that deprecated interfaces.

Similarly, the time_t use in fat_time_fat2unix() truncates the timestamp
on the way in, which can be avoided by using types that are wide enough to
hold the intermediate values during the conversion.
