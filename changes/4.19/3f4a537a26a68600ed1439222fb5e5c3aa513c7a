crypto: aead - remove useless setting of type flags

Some aead algorithms set .cra_flags = CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AEAD.  But this is
redundant with the C structure type ('struct aead_alg'), and
crypto_register_aead() already sets the type flag automatically,
clearing any type flag that was already there.  Apparently the useless
assignment has just been copy+pasted around.

So, remove the useless assignment from all the aead algorithms.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
