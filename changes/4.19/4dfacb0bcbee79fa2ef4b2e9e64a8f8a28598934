drm/i915: Switch to kernel context before idling at runtime

We can reduce our exposure to random neutrinos by resting on the kernel
context having flushed out the user contexts to system memory and
beyond. The corollary is that we then we require two passes through the
idle handler to go to sleep, which on a truly idle system involves an
extra pass through the slow and irregular retire work handler.
