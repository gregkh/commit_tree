s390/zcrypt: hex string mask improvements for apmask and aqmask.

The sysfs attributes /sys/bus/ap/apmask and /sys/bus/ap/aqmask
and the kernel command line arguments ap.apm and ap.aqm get
an improvement of the value parsing with this patch:

The mask values are bitmaps in big endian order starting with bit 0.
So adapter number 0 is the leftmost bit, mask is 0x8000... The sysfs
attributes and the kernel command line accept 2 different formats:
 - Absolute hex string starting with 0x like "0x12345678" does set
   the mask starting from left to right. If the given string is shorter
   than the mask it is padded with 0s on the right. If the string is
   longer than the mask an error comes back (EINVAL).
 - Relative format - a concatenation (done with ',') of the terms
   +<bitnr>[-<bitnr>] or -<bitnr>[-<bitnr>]. <bitnr> may be any
   valid number (hex, decimal or octal) in the range 0...255.
   Here are some examples:
     "+0-15,+32,-128,-0xFF"
     "-0-255,+1-16,+0x128"
