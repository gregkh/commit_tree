mm/vmscan.c: move check for SHRINKER_NUMA_AWARE to do_shrink_slab()

In case of shrink_slab_memcg() we do not zero nid, when shrinker is not
numa-aware.  This is not a real problem, since currently all memcg-aware
shrinkers are numa-aware too (we have two: super_block shrinker and
workingset shrinker), but something may change in the future.
