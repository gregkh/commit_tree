dt-bindings: serial: 8250_omap: Add compatible for AM654 UART controller

AM654 uses a UART controller that is only partially compatible with
existing 8250 UART. UART DMA integration is substantially different
and even a match against standard 8250 or omap4 would result in
non-working UART once DMA is enabled by default.

Introduce a specific compatible to help build up the differences in
follow on patches.
