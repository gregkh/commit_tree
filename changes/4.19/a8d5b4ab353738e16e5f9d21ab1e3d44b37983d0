xdp: Helper function to clear kernel pointers in xdp_frame

xdp_frame has kernel pointers which should not be readable from bpf
programs. When we want to reuse xdp_frame region but it may be read by
bpf programs later, we can use this helper to clear kernel pointers.
This is more efficient than calling memset() for the entire struct.
