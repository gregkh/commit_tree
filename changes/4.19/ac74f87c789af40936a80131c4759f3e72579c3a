net: 6lowpan: fix reserved space for single frames

This patch fixes patch add handling to take care tail and headroom for
single 6lowpan frames. We need to be sure we have a skb with the right
head and tailroom for single frames. This patch do it by using
skb_copy_expand() if head and tailroom is not enough allocated by upper
layer.
