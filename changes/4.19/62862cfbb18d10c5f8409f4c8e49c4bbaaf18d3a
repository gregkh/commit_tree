drm/arm/malidp: Modified the prototype of malidp irq de-initializers

Malidp uses two interrupts ie 1. se_irq - used for memory writeback.
 and 2. de_irq - used for display output.
'struct drm_device' is being replaced with 'struct malidp_hw_device'
as the function argument. The reason being the dependency of
malidp_de_irq_fini on 'struct drm_device' needs to be removed so as to
enable it to call from functions which receives 'struct malidp_hw_device'
as argument. Furthermore, there is no way to retrieve 'struct drm_device'
from 'struct malidp_hw_device'.
