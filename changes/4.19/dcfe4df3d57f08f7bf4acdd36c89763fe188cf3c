mm/page-writeback.c: update stale account_page_redirty() comment

Commit 93f78d882865 ("writeback: move backing_dev_info->bdi_stat[] into
bdi_writeback") replaced BDI_DIRTIED with WB_DIRTIED in
account_page_redirty().  Update comment to track that change.

  BDI_DIRTIED => WB_DIRTIED
  BDI_WRITTEN => WB_WRITTEN
