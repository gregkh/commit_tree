dm integrity: change 'suspending' variable from bool to int

Early alpha processors can't write a byte or short atomically - they
read 8 bytes, modify the byte or two bytes in registers and write back
8 bytes.

The modification of the variable "suspending" may race with
modification of the variable "failed".  Fix this by changing
"suspending" to an int.
