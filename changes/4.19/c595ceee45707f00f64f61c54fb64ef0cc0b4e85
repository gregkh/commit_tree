x86/KVM/VMX: Add L1D flush logic

Add the logic for flushing L1D on VMENTER. The flush depends on the static
key being enabled and the new l1tf_flush_l1d flag being set.

The flags is set:
 - Always, if the flush module parameter is 'always'

 - Conditionally at:
   - Entry to vcpu_run(), i.e. after executing user space

   - From the sched_in notifier, i.e. when switching to a vCPU thread.

   - From vmexit handlers which are considered unsafe, i.e. where
     sensitive data can be brought into L1D:

     - The emulator, which could be a good target for other speculative
       execution-based threats,

     - The MMU, which can bring host page tables in the L1 cache.
     
     - External interrupts

     - Nested operations that require the MMU (see above). That is
       vmptrld, vmptrst, vmclear,vmwrite,vmread.

     - When handling invept,invvpid

[ tglx: Split out from combo patch and reduced to a single flag ]
