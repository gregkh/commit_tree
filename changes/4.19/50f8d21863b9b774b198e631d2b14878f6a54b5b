drm/msm/adreno: Add a5xx specific registers for the GPU state

HLSQ, SP and TP registers are only accessible from a special
aperture and to make matters worse the aperture is blocked from
the CPU on targets that can support secure rendering. Luckily the
GPU hardware has its own purpose built register dumper that can
access the registers from the aperture. Add a5xx specific code
to program the crashdumper and retrieve the wayward registers
and dump them for the crash state.

Also, remove a block of registers the regular CPU accessible
list that aren't useful for debug which helps reduce the size
of the crash state file by a goodly amount.
