MIPS: Change definition of cpu_relax() for Loongson-3

Linux expects that if a CPU modifies a memory location, then that
modification will eventually become visible to other CPUs in the system.

Loongson 3 CPUs include a Store Fill Buffer (SFB) which sits between a
core & its L1 data cache, queueing memory accesses & allowing for faster
forwarding of data from pending stores to younger loads from the core.
Unfortunately the SFB prioritizes loads such that a continuous stream of
loads may cause a pending write to be buffered indefinitely. This is
problematic if we end up with 2 CPUs which each perform a store that the
other polls for - one or both CPUs may end up with their stores buffered
in the SFB, never reaching cache due to the continuous reads from the
poll loop. Such a deadlock condition has been observed whilst running
qspinlock code.

This patch changes the definition of cpu_relax() to smp_mb() for
Loongson-3, forcing a flush of the SFB on SMP systems which will cause
any pending writes to make it as far as the L1 caches where they will
become visible to other CPUs. If the kernel is not compiled for SMP
support, this will expand to a barrier() as before.

This workaround matches that currently implemented for ARM when
CONFIG_ARM_ERRATA_754327=y, which was introduced by commit 534be1d5a2da
("ARM: 6194/1: change definition of cpu_relax() for ARM11MPCore").

Although the workaround is only required when the Loongson 3 SFB
functionality is enabled, and we only began explicitly enabling that
functionality in v4.7 with commit 1e820da3c9af ("MIPS: Loongson-3:
Introduce CONFIG_LOONGSON3_ENHANCEMENT"), existing or future firmware
may enable the SFB which means we may need the workaround backported to
earlier kernels too.

  - Reword commit message & comment.
  - Limit stable backport to v3.15+ where we support Loongson 3 CPUs.]
