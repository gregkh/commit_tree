blk-cgroup: increase number of supported policies

After merging the iolatency policy, we potentially now have 4 policies
being registered, but only support 3. This causes one of them to fail
loading. Takashi reports that BFQ no longer works for him, because it
fails to load due to policy registration failure.

Bump to 5 policies, and also add a warning for when we have exceeded
the global amount. If we have to touch this again, we should switch
to a dynamic scheme instead.
