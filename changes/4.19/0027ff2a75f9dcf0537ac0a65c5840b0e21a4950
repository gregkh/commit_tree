KVM: VMX: fixes for vmentry_l1d_flush module parameter

Two bug fixes:

1) missing entries in the l1d_param array; this can cause a host crash
if an access attempts to reach the missing entry. Future-proof the get
function against any overflows as well.  However, the two entries
VMENTER_L1D_FLUSH_EPT_DISABLED and VMENTER_L1D_FLUSH_NOT_REQUIRED must
not be accepted by the parse function, so disable them there.

2) invalid values must be rejected even if the CPU does not have the
bug, so test for them before checking boot_cpu_has(X86_BUG_L1TF)

... and a small refactoring, since the .cmd field is redundant with
the index in the array.
