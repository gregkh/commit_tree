PCI: Whitelist Thunderbolt ports for runtime D3

Thunderbolt controllers can be runtime suspended to D3cold to save ~1.5W.
This requires that runtime D3 is allowed on its PCIe ports, so whitelist
them.

The 2015 BIOS cutoff that we've instituted for runtime D3 on PCIe ports
is unnecessary on Thunderbolt because we know that even the oldest
controller, Light Ridge (2010), is able to suspend its ports to D3 just
fine -- specifically including its hotplug ports.  And the power saving
should be afforded to machines even if their BIOS predates 2015.
