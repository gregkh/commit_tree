rcu: Add comment to the last sleep in the rcu tasks loop

At the end of rcu_tasks_kthread() there's a lonely
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible() call with no apparent rationale for
its existence. But there is. It is to keep the thread from going into
a tight loop if there's some anomaly. That really needs a comment.
