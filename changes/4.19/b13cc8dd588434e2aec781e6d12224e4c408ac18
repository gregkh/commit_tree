drm: writeback: Add out-fences for writeback connectors

Add the WRITEBACK_OUT_FENCE_PTR property to writeback connectors, to
enable userspace to get a fence which will signal once the writeback is
complete. It is not allowed to request an out-fence without a
framebuffer attached to the connector.

A timeline is added to drm_writeback_connector for use by the writeback
out-fences.

In the case of a commit failure or DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY, the fence
is set to -1.

Changes from v2:
 - Rebase onto Gustavo Padovan's v9 explicit sync series
 - Change out_fence_ptr type to s32 __user *
 - Set *out_fence_ptr to -1 in drm_atomic_connector_set_property
 - Store fence in drm_writeback_job
 Gustavo Padovan:
 - Move out_fence_ptr out of connector_state
 - Signal fence from drm_writeback_signal_completion instead of
   in driver directly

Changes from v3:
 - Rebase onto commit 7e9081c5aac7 ("drm/fence: fix memory overwrite
   when setting out_fence fd") (change out_fence_ptr to s32 __user *,
   for real this time.)
 - Update documentation around WRITEBACK_OUT_FENCE_PTR
