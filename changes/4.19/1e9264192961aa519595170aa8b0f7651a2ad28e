mm/hmm.c: remove unused variables align_start and align_end

Variables align_start and align_end are being assigned but are never
used hence they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
  warning: variable 'align_start' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  warning: variable 'align_size' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
