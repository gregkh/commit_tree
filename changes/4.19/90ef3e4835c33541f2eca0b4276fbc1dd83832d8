crypto: sha1_generic - add cra_priority

sha1-generic had a cra_priority of 0, so it wasn't possible to have a
lower priority SHA-1 implementation, as is desired for sha1_mb which is
only useful under certain workloads and is otherwise extremely slow.
Change it to priority 100, which is the priority used for many of the
other generic algorithms.
