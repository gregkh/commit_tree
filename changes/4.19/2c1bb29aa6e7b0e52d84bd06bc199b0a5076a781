firewire: use 64-bit time_t based interfaces

32-bit CLOCK_REALTIME timestamps overflow in year 2038, so all such
interfaces are deprecated now.  For the FW_CDEV_IOC_GET_CYCLE_TIMER2
ioctl, we already support 64-bit timestamps, but the implementation
still uses timespec.

This changes the code to use timespec64 instead with the appropriate
accessor functions.
