isdn: hisax: config: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL

hisax_cs_new() and hisax_cs_setup() are never called in atomic context.
They call kmalloc() and kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
