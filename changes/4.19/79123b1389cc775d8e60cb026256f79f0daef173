kconfig: create directories needed for syncconfig by itself

'make syncconfig' creates some files such as include/config/auto.conf,
include/generate/autoconf.h, etc. but the necessary directory creation
relies on scripts/kconfig/Makefile.

To make Kconfig self-contained, create directories as needed in
conf_write_autoconf().

This change allows scripts/kconfig/Makefile cleanups; syncconfig can
be merged into simple-targets.
