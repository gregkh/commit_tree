drm/amd/display: Read AUX channel even if only status byte is returned

[Why]
get_channel_status() can return 0 in returned_bytes, and report a
successful operation result. This is because it prunes the first status
byte out. This was preventing read_channel_reply() from being called
(due to the faulty condition), and consequently preventing the AUX
reply status from being set.

[How]
Fix the conditional so that it accounts for when get_channel_status()
returns 0 bytes read.

[Fixes]
Fixes possible edid read failures during S3 resume, where we are now
relying on DRM's DP AUX handling. This was an regression introduced by:
