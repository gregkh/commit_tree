PCI: pciehp: Declare pciehp_enable/disable_slot() static

No callers of pciehp_enable/disable_slot() outside of pciehp_ctrl.c
remain, so declare the functions static.  For now this requires forward
declarations.  Those can be eliminated by reshuffling functions once the
ongoing effort to refactor the driver has settled.
