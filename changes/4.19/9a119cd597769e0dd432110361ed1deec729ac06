RDMA/uverbs: Get rid of the & in method specifications

Hide it inside the macros. The & is confusing and interferes with using
this as a generic DSL in later patches.

Since this also touches almost every line, also run the specs through
clang-format (with 'BinPackParameters: false') to make the maintenance
easier.
