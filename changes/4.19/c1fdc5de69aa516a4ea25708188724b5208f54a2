staging:rtl8192u: Rename TsCommonInfo - Style

Rename the member variable TsCommonInfo in two structures, both
tx_ts_record and RX_TS_RECORD. This member variable is used in both
structures and in both cases causes a checkpatch issue with CamelCase
naming.

The changes are purely coding style and should not impact runtime
code execution.
