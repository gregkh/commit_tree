ALSA: hda - Sleep for 10ms after entering D3 on Conexant codecs

On rare occasions, we are still noticing that the internal speaker
spitting out spurious noises even after adding the problematic codec
to the list.

Adding a 10ms artificial delay before rebooting fixes the issue entirely.

Patch for Realtek codecs also adds the same amount of delay after
entering D3.
