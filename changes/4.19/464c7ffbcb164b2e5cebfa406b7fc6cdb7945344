mm/hugetlb: filter out hugetlb pages if HUGEPAGE migration is not supported.

When scanning for movable pages, filter out Hugetlb pages if hugepage
migration is not supported.  Without this we hit infinte loop in
__offline_pages() where we do

	pfn = scan_movable_pages(start_pfn, end_pfn);
	if (pfn) { /* We have movable pages */
		ret = do_migrate_range(pfn, end_pfn);
		goto repeat;
	}

Fix this by checking hugepage_migration_supported both in
has_unmovable_pages which is the primary backoff mechanism for page
offlining and for consistency reasons also into scan_movable_pages
because it doesn't make any sense to return a pfn to non-migrateable
huge page.

This issue was revealed by, but not caused by 72b39cfc4d75 ("mm,
memory_hotplug: do not fail offlining too early").
