efi/x86: Add missing NULL initialization in UGA draw protocol discovery

The UGA draw protocol discovery routine looks for a EFI handle that has
both the UGA draw protocol and the PCI I/O protocol installed. It checks
for the latter by calling handle_protocol() and pass it a PCI I/O
protocol pointer variable by reference, but fails to initialize it to
NULL, which means the non-NULL check later on in the code could produce
false positives, given that the return code of the handle_protocol() call
is ignored entirely. So add the missing initialization.
