udp6: fix encap return code for resubmitting

The commit eb63f2964dbe ("udp6: add missing checks on edumux packet
processing") used the same return code convention of the ipv4 counterpart,
but ipv6 uses the opposite one: positive values means resubmit.

This change addresses the issue, using positive return value for
resubmitting. Also update the related comment, which was broken, too.
