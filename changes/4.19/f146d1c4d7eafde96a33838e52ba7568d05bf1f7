HID: multitouch: Store per collection multitouch data

Currently, hid-multitouch can only handle one multitouch collection at
a time. This is an issue for the Dell Canvas, as the Totem (a dial tool)
is also using a multitouch-like collection.

Factor out the multitouch collection data in their own struct.
