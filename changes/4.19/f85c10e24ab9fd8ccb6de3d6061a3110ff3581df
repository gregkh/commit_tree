gfs2: eliminate rs_inum and reduce the size of gfs2 inodes

Before this patch, block reservations kept track of the inode
number. At one point, that was a valid thing to do. However, since
we made the reservation a part of the inode (rather than a pointer
to a separate allocated object) the reservation can determine the
inode number by using container_of. This saves us a little memory
in our inode.
