s390/decompressor: rename entry point to startup_decompressor

Rename the decompressor entry point to startup_decompressor to
avoid confusion, leaving startup_continue as the entry point of the
uncompressed image.

Also remove obsolete comment, as the decompressor code is
unconditionally called from boot/head.S now.
