RDS: IB: Use DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED for rds_ib_stats

Clang warns when two declarations' section attributes don't match.

The initial definition was added in commit ec16227e1414 ("RDS/IB:
Infiniband transport") and the cache aligned definition was added in
commit e6babe4cc4ce ("RDS/IB: Stats and sysctls") right after. The
definition probably should have been updated in net/rds/ib.h, which is
what this patch does.
