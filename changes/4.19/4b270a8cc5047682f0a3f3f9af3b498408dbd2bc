f2fs: try grabbing node page lock aggressively in sync scenario

In synchronous scenario, like in checkpoint(), we are going to flush
dirty node pages to device synchronously, we can easily failed
writebacking node page due to trylock_page() failure, especially in
condition of intensive lock competition, which can cause long latency
of checkpoint(). So let's use lock_page() in synchronous scenario to
avoid this issue.
