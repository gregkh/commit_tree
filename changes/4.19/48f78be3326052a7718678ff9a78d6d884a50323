nvme: remove ns sibling before clearing path

The code had been clearing a namespace being deleted as the current
path while that namespace was still in the path siblings list. It is
possible a new IO could set that namespace back to the current path
since it appeared to be an eligable path to select, which may result in
a use-after-free error.

This patch ensures a namespace being removed is not eligable to be reset
as a current path prior to clearing it as the current path.
