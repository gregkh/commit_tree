net: core: fix uses-after-free in list processing

In netif_receive_skb_list_internal(), all of skb_defer_rx_timestamp(),
 do_xdp_generic() and enqueue_to_backlog() can lead to kfree(skb).  Thus,
 we cannot wait until after they return to remove the skb from the list;
 instead, we remove it first and, in the pass case, add it to a sublist
 afterwards.
In the case of enqueue_to_backlog() we have already decided not to pass
 when we call the function, so we do not need a sublist.
