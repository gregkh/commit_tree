ASoC: q6routing: initialize data correctly

Some of the router data fields are left as default zeros which are
valid dai ids, so initialize these to invalid value of -1.

Without intializing these correctly get_session_from_id() can return
incorrect session resulting in not closing the opened copp and messing
up with the copp ref count.
