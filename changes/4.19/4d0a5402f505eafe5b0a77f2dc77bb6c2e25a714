mm/zsmalloc.c: make several functions and a struct static

The functions zs_page_isolate, zs_page_migrate, zs_page_putback,
lock_zspage, trylock_zspage and structure zsmalloc_aops are local to
source and do not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
  symbol 'zs_page_isolate' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'zs_page_migrate' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'zs_page_putback' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'zsmalloc_aops' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'lock_zspage' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'trylock_zspage' was not declared. Should it be static?
