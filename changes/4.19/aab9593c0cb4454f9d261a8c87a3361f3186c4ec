efi/x86: Replace references to efi_early->is64 with efi_is_64bit()

There are a couple of places in the x86 EFI stub code where we select
between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the support routines based on
the value of efi_early->is64. Referencing that field directly is a
bad idea, since it prevents the compiler from inferring that this
field can never be true on a 32-bit build, and can only become false
on a 64-bit build if support for mixed mode is compiled in. This
results in dead code to be retained in the uncompressed part of the
kernel image, which is wasteful.

So switch to the efi_is_64bit() helper, which will resolve to a
constant boolean unless building for 64-bit with mixed mode support.
