drm/i915/execlists: Disable submission tasklet upon wedging

If we declare the driver wedged before the GPU truly is, then we may see
the GPU complete some CS events following our cancellation. This leaves
us quite confused as we deleted all the bookkeeping and thus complain
about the inconsistent state.

We can just ignore the remaining events and let the GPU idle by not
feeding it, and so avoid trying to racily overwrite shared state. We
rely on there being a full GPU reset before unwedging, giving us the
opportunity to reset the shared state.
