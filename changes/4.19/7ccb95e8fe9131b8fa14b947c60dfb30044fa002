gcc-plugins: Regularize Makefile.gcc-plugins

The layout of Makefile.gcc-plugins had uneven tabs, and the long names
of things made this file a bit hard to quickly visually parse. This
breaks lines and moves options to the same tab depth. While we're at
it, this also adds some comments about the various sections.
