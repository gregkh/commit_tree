powerpc/mm/tlbflush: update the mmu_gather page size while iterating address range

This patch makes sure we update the mmu_gather page size even if we are
requesting for a fullmm flush. This avoids triggering VM_WARN_ON in code
paths like __tlb_remove_page_size that explicitly check for removing range page
size to be same as mmu gather page size.
