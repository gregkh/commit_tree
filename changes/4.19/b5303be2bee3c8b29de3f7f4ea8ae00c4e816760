9p: Change p9_fid_create calling convention

Return NULL instead of ERR_PTR when we can't allocate a FID.  The ENOSPC
return value was getting all the way back to userspace, and that's
confusing for a userspace program which isn't expecting read() to tell it
there's no space left on the filesystem.  The best error we can return to
indicate a temporary failure caused by lack of client resources is ENOMEM.

Maybe it would be better to sleep until a FID is available, but that's
not a change I'm comfortable making.
