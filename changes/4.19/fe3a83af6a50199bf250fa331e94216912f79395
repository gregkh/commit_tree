declance: Fix continuation with the adapter identification message

Fix a commit 4bcc595ccd80 ("printk: reinstate KERN_CONT for printing
continuation lines") regression with the `declance' driver, which caused
the adapter identification message to be split between two lines, e.g.:

declance.c: v0.011 by Linux MIPS DECstation task force
tc6: PMAD-AA
, addr = 08:00:2b:1b:2a:6a, irq = 14
tc6: registered as eth0.

Address that properly, by printing identification with a single call,
making the messages now look like:

declance.c: v0.011 by Linux MIPS DECstation task force
tc6: PMAD-AA, addr = 08:00:2b:1b:2a:6a, irq = 14
tc6: registered as eth0.
