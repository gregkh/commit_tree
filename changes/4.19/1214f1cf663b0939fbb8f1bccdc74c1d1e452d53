xfs: replace dop_low with transaction flag

The dop_low field enables the low free space allocation mode when a
previous allocation has detected difficulty allocating blocks. It
has historically been part of the xfs_defer_ops structure, which
means if enabled, it remains enabled across a set of transactions
until the deferred operations have completed and the dfops is reset.

Now that the dfops is embedded in the transaction, we can save a bit
more space by using a transaction flag rather than a standalone
boolean. Drop the ->dop_low field and replace it with a transaction
flag that is set at the same points, carried across rolling
transactions and cleared on completion of deferred operations. This
essentially emulates the behavior of ->dop_low and so should not
change behavior.
