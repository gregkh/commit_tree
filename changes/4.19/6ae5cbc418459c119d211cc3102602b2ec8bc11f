net: nvidia: forcedeth: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in nv_probe()

nv_probe() is never called in atomic context.
It calls dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
