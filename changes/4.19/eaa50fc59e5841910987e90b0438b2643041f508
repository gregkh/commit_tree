qed: Prevent a possible deadlock during driver load and unload

The MFW manages an internal lock to prevent concurrent hardware
(de)initialization of different PFs.
This, together with the busy-waiting for the MFW's responses for commands,
might lead to a deadlock during concurrent load or unload of PFs.
This patch adds the option to sleep within the busy-waiting, and uses it
for the (un)load requests (which are not sent from an interrupt context) to
prevent the possible deadlock.
