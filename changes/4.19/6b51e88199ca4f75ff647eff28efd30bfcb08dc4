mm/list_lru: introduce list_lru_shrink_walk_irq()

Provide list_lru_shrink_walk_irq() and let it behave like
list_lru_walk_one() except that it locks the spinlock with
spin_lock_irq().  This is used by scan_shadow_nodes() because its lock
nests within the i_pages lock which is acquired with IRQ.  This change
allows to use proper locking promitives instead hand crafted
lock_irq_disable() plus spin_lock().

There is no EXPORT_SYMBOL provided because the current user is in-kernel
only.

Add list_lru_shrink_walk_irq() which acquires the spinlock with the
proper locking primitives.
