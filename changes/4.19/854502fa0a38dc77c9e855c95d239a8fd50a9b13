drm/vkms: Add basic CRTC initialization

This commit adds the essential infrastructure for around CRTCs which
is composed of: a new data struct for output data information, a
function for creating planes, and a simple encoder attached to the
connector. Finally, due to the introduction of a new initialization
function, connectors were moved from vkms_drv.c to vkms_display.c.
