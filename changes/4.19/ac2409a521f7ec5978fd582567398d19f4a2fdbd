integrity: silence warning when CONFIG_SECURITYFS is not enabled

When CONFIG_SECURITYFS is not enabled, securityfs_create_dir returns
-ENODEV which throws the following error:
	"Unable to create integrity sysfs dir: -19"

However, if the feature is disabled, it can't be warning and hence
we need to silence the error. This patch checks for the error -ENODEV
which is returned when CONFIG_SECURITYFS is disabled to stop the error
being thrown.
