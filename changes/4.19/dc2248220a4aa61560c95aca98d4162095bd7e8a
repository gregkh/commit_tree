veth: Avoid drops by oversized packets when XDP is enabled

Oversized packets including GSO packets can be dropped if XDP is
enabled on receiver side, so don't send such packets from peer.

Drop TSO and SCTP fragmentation features so that veth devices themselves
segment packets with XDP enabled. Also cap MTU accordingly.

v4:
- Don't auto-adjust MTU but cap max MTU.
