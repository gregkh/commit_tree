mac80211_hwsim: Fix possible Spectre-v1 for hwsim_world_regdom_custom

User controls @idx which to be used as index of hwsim_world_regdom_custom.
So, It can be exploited via Spectre-like attack. (speculative execution)

This kind of attack leaks address of hwsim_world_regdom_custom,
It leads an attacker to bypass security mechanism such as KASLR.

So sanitize @idx before using it to prevent attack.

I leveraged strategy [1] to find and exploit this gadget.
