mailbox: ti-msgmgr: Add support for Secure Proxy

Secure Proxy is another communication scheme in Texas Instrument's
devices intended to provide an unique communication path from various
processors in the System on Chip(SoC) to a central System Controller.

Secure proxy is, in effect, an evolution of current generation Message
Manager hardware block found in K2G devices. However the following
changes have taken place:

Secure Proxy instance exposes "threads" or "proxies" which is
primary representation of "a" communication channel. Each thread is
preconfigured by System controller configuration based on SoC usage
requirements. Secure proxy by itself represents a single "queue" of
communication but allows the proxies to be independently operated.

Each Secure proxy thread can uniquely have their own error and threshold
interrupts allowing for more fine control of IRQ handling.

Provide the driver support for Secure Proxy and thread instances.

NOTE: Secure proxy configuration is only done by System Controller,
hence these are assumed to be pre-configured instances.
