arm64: use {COMPAT,}SYSCALL_DEFINE0 for sigreturn

We don't currently annotate our various sigreturn functions as syscalls,
as we need to do to use pt_regs syscall wrappers.

Let's mark them as real syscalls.

For compat_sys_sigreturn and compat_sys_rt_sigreturn, this changes the
return type from int to long, matching the prototypes in sys32.c.
