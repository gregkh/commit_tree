ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: hide unused r8a7779_platform_cpu_kill

After the cleanup in r8a7779_smp_prepare_cpus(), the only remaining caller of
r8a7779_platform_cpu_kill() is in an ifdef, which leads to a build warning
without CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU:

arch/arm/mach-shmobile/smp-r8a7779.c:26:12: error: 'r8a7779_platform_cpu_kill' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This moves the function inside of that #ifdef to avoid the warning.
