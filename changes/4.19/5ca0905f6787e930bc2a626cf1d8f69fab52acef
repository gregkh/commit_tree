rcu: Fix cpustart tracepoint gp_seq number

The "cpustart" trace event shows a stale gp_seq. This is because it uses
rdp->gp_seq, which is updated only at the end of the __note_gp_changes()
function. This commit therefore instead uses rnp->gp_seq.

An alternative fix would be to update rdp->gp_seq earlier, but this would
break RCU's detection of the beginning of a new-to-this-CPU grace period.
