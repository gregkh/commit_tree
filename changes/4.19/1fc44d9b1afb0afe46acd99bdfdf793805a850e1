drm/i915: Store a pointer to intel_context in i915_request

To ease the frequent and ugly pointer dance of
&request->gem_context->engine[request->engine->id] during request
submission, store that pointer as request->hw_context. One major
advantage that we will exploit later is that this decouples the logical
context state from the engine itself.

v2: Set mock_context->ops so we don't crash and burn in selftests.
