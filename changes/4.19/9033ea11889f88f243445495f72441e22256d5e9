cpufreq/schedutil: Take time spent in interrupts into account

The time spent executing IRQ handlers can be significant but it is not reflected
in the utilization of CPU when deciding to choose an OPP. Now that we have
access to this metric, schedutil can take it into account when selecting
the OPP for a CPU.

RQS utilization don't see the time spend under interrupt context and report
their value in the normal context time window. We need to compensate this when
adding interrupt utilization

The CPU utilization is:

  IRQ util_avg + (1 - IRQ util_avg / max capacity ) * /Sum rq util_avg

A test with iperf on hikey (octo arm64) gives the following speedup:

 iperf -c server_address -r -t 5

 w/o patch		w/ patch
 Tx 276 Mbits/sec	304 Mbits/sec +10%
 Rx 299 Mbits/sec	328 Mbits/sec  +9%

 8 iterations
 stdev is lower than 1%

Only WFI idle state is enabled (shallowest idle state).
