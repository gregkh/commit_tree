smb3: enumerating snapshots was leaving part of the data off end

When enumerating snapshots, the last few bytes of the final
snapshot could be left off since we were miscalculating the
length returned (leaving off the sizeof struct SRV_SNAPSHOT_ARRAY)
See MS-SMB2 section 2.2.32.2. In addition fixup the length used
to allow smaller buffer to be passed in, in order to allow
returning the size of the whole snapshot array more easily.

Sample userspace output with a kernel patched with this
(mounted to a Windows volume with two snapshots).
Before this patch, the second snapshot would be missing a
few bytes at the end.
