PCI: dwc: Fix EP link notification implementation

Move specific features settings from EP shared code
(pcie-designware-ep.c) to the driver (pcie-designware-plat.c).

Previous implementation disables the EP link notification
by default for all SoCs that uses EP DesignWare IP, which affects
directly the dra7xx and artpec6 SoCs.
