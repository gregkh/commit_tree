drm/panel: p079zca: Add variable unprepare_delay properties

When panel power down, p079zca need delay between reset and disable
power supply, but p097pfg does not need it. Similarly p097zca needs
a delay after entering panel sleep mode. So add two delay properties,
so we can meet these two panel power down sequence.
