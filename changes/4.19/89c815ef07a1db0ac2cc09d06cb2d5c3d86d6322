drm/ttm: Introduce ttm_bo_get() and ttm_bo_put() for ref counting

The TTM buffer-object interface provides ttm_bo_reference() and
ttm_bo_unref() for managing reference counts. Replacing them with
ttm_bo_get() and ttm_bo_put() aligns the API with conventions used
throughout the Linux kernel.

The implementation of ttm_bo_unref() clears the supplied pointer
to NULL. This leads to workarounds where the caller saves the
pointer's value before de-referencing the BO. ttm_bo_put() does
not clear the supplied pointer.
