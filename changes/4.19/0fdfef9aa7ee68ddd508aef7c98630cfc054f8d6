smb3: simplify code by removing CONFIG_CIFS_SMB311

We really, really want to be encouraging use of secure dialects,
and SMB3.1.1 offers useful security features, and will soon
be the recommended dialect for many use cases. Simplify the code
by removing the CONFIG_CIFS_SMB311 ifdef so users don't disable
it in the build, and create compatibility and/or security issues
with modern servers - many of which have been supporting this
dialect for multiple years.

Also clarify some of the Kconfig text for cifs.ko about
SMB3.1.1 and current supported features in the module.
