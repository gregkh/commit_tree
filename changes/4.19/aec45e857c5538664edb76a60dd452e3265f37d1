s390/qeth: use vzalloc for QUERY OAT buffer

qeth_query_oat_command() currently allocates the kernel buffer for
the SIOC_QETH_QUERY_OAT ioctl with kzalloc. So on systems with
fragmented memory, large allocations may fail (eg. the qethqoat tool by
default uses 132KB).

Solve this issue by using vzalloc, backing the allocation with
non-contiguous memory.
