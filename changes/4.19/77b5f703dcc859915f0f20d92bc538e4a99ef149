powerpc/powernv/opal: Use standard interrupts property when available

For (bad) historical reasons, OPAL used to create a non-standard pair
of properties "opal-interrupts" and "opal-interrupts-names" for
representing the list of interrupts it wants Linux to request on its
behalf.

Among other issues, the opal-interrupts doesn't have a way to carry
the type of interrupts, and they were assumed to be all level
sensitive.

This is wrong on some recent systems where some of them are edge
sensitive causing warnings in the XIVE code and possible misbehaviours
if they need to be retriggered (typically the NPU2 TCE error
interrupts).

This makes Linux switch to using the standard "interrupts" and
"interrupt-names" properties instead when they are available, using
standard of_irq helpers, which can carry all the desired type
information.

Newer versions of OPAL will generate those properties in addition to
the legacy ones.
