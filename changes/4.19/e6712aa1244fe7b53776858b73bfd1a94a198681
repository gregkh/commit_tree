ath10k: remove redundant pointers 'dev' and 'noa'

Pointers dev and noa are being assigned but are never used hence they
are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'dev' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'noa' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
