btrfs: use after free in btrfs_quota_enable

The issue here is that btrfs_commit_transaction() frees "trans" on both
the error and the success path.  So the problem would be if
btrfs_commit_transaction() succeeds, and then qgroup_rescan_init()
fails.  That means that "ret" is non-zero and "trans" is non-NULL and it
leads to a use after free inside the btrfs_end_transaction() macro.
