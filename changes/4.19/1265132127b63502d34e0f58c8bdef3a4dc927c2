arm64: don't zero DIT on signal return

Currently valid_user_regs() treats SPSR_ELx.DIT as a RES0 bit, causing
it to be zeroed upon exception return, rather than preserved. Thus, code
relying on DIT will not function as expected, and may expose an
unexpected timing sidechannel.

Let's remove DIT from the set of RES0 bits, such that it is preserved.
At the same time, the related comment is updated to better describe the
situation, and to take into account the most recent documentation of
SPSR_ELx, in ARM DDI 0487C.a.
