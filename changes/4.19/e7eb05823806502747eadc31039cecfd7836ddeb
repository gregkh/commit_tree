tipc: queue socket protocol error messages into socket receive buffer

In tipc_sk_filter_rcv(), when we detect protocol messages with error we
call tipc_sk_conn_proto_rcv() and let it reset the connection and notify
the socket by calling sk->sk_state_change().

However, tipc_sk_filter_rcv() may have been called from the function
tipc_backlog_rcv(), in which case the socket lock is held and the socket
already awake. This means that the sk_state_change() call is ignored and
the error notification lost. Now the receive queue will remain empty and
the socket sleeps forever.

In this commit, we convert the protocol message into a connection abort
message and enqueue it into the socket's receive queue. By this addition
to the above state change we cover all conditions.
