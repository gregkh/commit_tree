selftests: forwarding: gre_multipath: Drop IPv6 tests

Support for device-only IPv6 multipath next hops was dropped in
commit 33bd5ac54dc4 ("net/ipv6: Revert attempt to simplify route replace
and append") and as of commit b5d2d75e079a ("net/ipv6: Do not allow
device only routes via the multipath API"), attempts to add a next hop
like that yield an explicit diagnostic.

Correspondingly, drop the IPv6 parts of GRE multipath test that are
supposed to test that code.
