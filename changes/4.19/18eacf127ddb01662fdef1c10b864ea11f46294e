staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused Zebra1 definitions - Style

Remove unused 'Zebra1' definitions. These definitions fail the checkpatch
CamelCase test, rather then rename, these unused definitions have simply
been removed. This is a coding style change which should have not impact
on runtime code execution.
