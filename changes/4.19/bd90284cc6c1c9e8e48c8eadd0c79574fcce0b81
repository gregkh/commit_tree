powerpc/powernv: opal_put_chars partial write fix

The intention here is to consume and discard the remaining buffer
upon error. This works if there has not been a previous partial write.
If there has been, then total_len is no longer total number of bytes
to copy. total_len is always "bytes left to copy", so it should be
added to written bytes.

This code may not be exercised any more if partial writes will not be
hit, but this is a small bugfix before a larger change.
