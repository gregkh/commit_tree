qed: Avoid constant logical operation warning in qed_vf_pf_acquire

Clang warns when a constant is used in a boolean context as it thinks a
bitwise operation may have been intended.

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_vf.c:415:27: warning: use of logical
'&&' with constant operand [-Wconstant-logical-operand]
        if (!p_iov->b_pre_fp_hsi &&
                                 ^
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_vf.c:415:27: note: use '&' for a
bitwise operation
        if (!p_iov->b_pre_fp_hsi &&
                                 ^~
                                 &
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_vf.c:415:27: note: remove constant
to silence this warning
        if (!p_iov->b_pre_fp_hsi &&
                                ~^~
1 warning generated.

This has been here since commit 1fe614d10f45 ("qed: Relax VF firmware
requirements") and I am not entirely sure why since 0 isn't a special
case. Just remove the statement causing Clang to warn since it isn't
required.
