KVM: s390: Add huge page enablement control

General KVM huge page support on s390 has to be enabled via the
kvm.hpage module parameter. Either nested or hpage can be enabled, as
we currently do not support vSIE for huge backed guests. Once the vSIE
support is added we will either drop the parameter or enable it as
default.

For a guest the feature has to be enabled through the new
KVM_CAP_S390_HPAGE_1M capability and the hpage module
parameter. Enabling it means that cmm can't be enabled for the vm and
disables pfmf and storage key interpretation.

This is due to the fact that in some cases, in upcoming patches, we
have to split huge pages in the guest mapping to be able to set more
granular memory protection on 4k pages. These split pages have fake
page tables that are not visible to the Linux memory management which
subsequently will not manage its PGSTEs, while the SIE will. Disabling
these features lets us manage PGSTE data in a consistent matter and
solve that problem.
