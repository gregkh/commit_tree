r8169: set RX_MULTI_EN bit in RxConfig for 8168F-family chips

It has been reported that since
commit 05212ba8132b42 ("r8169: set RxConfig after tx/rx is enabled for RTL8169sb/8110sb devices")
at least RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_38 NICs work erratically after a resume from
suspend.
The problem has been traced to a missing RX_MULTI_EN bit in the RxConfig
register.
We already set this bit for RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_35 NICs of the same 8168F
chip family so let's do it also for its other siblings: RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_36
and RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_38.

Curiously, the NIC seems to work fine after a system boot without having
this bit set as long as the system isn't suspended and resumed.
