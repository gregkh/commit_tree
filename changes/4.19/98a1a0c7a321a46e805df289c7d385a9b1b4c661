usb: typec: unlock dp->lock on error exit path, and also zero ret if successful

One of the error handling paths forgets to unlock dp->lock on the error
exit path leading to a potential lock-up.  Also the return path for a
successful call to the function configuration_store can return an
uninitialized error return code if dp->alt->active is false, so ensure
ret is zeroed on the successful exit path to avoid garbage being returned.
