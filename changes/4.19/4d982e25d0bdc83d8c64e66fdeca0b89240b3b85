ext4: avoid divide by zero fault when deleting corrupted inline directories

A specially crafted file system can trick empty_inline_dir() into
reading past the last valid entry in a inline directory, and then run
into the end of xattr marker. This will trigger a divide by zero
fault.  Fix this by using the size of the inline directory instead of
dir->i_size.

Also clean up error reporting in __ext4_check_dir_entry so that the
message is clearer and more understandable --- and avoids the division
by zero trap if the size passed in is zero.  (I'm not sure why we
coded it that way in the first place; printing offset % size is
actually more confusing and less useful.)
