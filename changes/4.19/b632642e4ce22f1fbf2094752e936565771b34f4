fsi/fsi-master-gpio: Reduce dpoll clocks

FSI_GPIO_DPOLL_CLOCKS is the number of clocks before sending
a DPOLL command after receiving a BUSY status. It should be
at least tSendDelay (16 clocks).

According to comments in the code, it needs to also be at least
21 clocks due to HW issues.

It's currently 100 clocks which impacts performances negatively
in some cases. Reduces it in half to 50 clocks which seems to
still be solid.
