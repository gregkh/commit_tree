checkpatch: improve runtime execution speed a little

checkpatch repeatedly uses a runtime minimum version check that validates
the minimum perl version required for a regex match by using a "$^V ge
5.10.0" runtime string match.

Only perform that minimum version test once and store the result to reduce
string matching time.

This reduces runtime execution time for patches or files with high line
counts.

An example runtime improvement:

new: $ time ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_main.c > /dev/null

real	0m11.856s
user	0m11.831s
sys	0m0.025s

old: $ time ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_main.c > /dev/null

real	0m13.330s
user	0m13.282s
sys	0m0.049s
