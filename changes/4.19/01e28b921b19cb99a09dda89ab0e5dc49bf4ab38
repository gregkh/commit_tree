l2tp: split l2tp_session_get()

l2tp_session_get() is used for two different purposes. If 'tunnel' is
NULL, the session is searched globally in the supplied network
namespace. Otherwise it is searched exclusively in the tunnel context.

Callers always know the context in which they need to search the
session. But some of them do provide both a namespace and a tunnel,
making the semantic of the call unclear.

This patch defines l2tp_tunnel_get_session() for lookups done in a
tunnel and restricts l2tp_session_get() to namespace searches.
