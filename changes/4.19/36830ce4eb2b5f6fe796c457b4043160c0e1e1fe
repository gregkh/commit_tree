drm/panel: otm8009a: Fix glitches by moving backlight enable to otm8009a_enable()

The backlight 1st update was in the otm8009a_prepare() function for a
bad reason: backlight was not working in video mode and the
otm8009a_prepare() is in command mode for the init sequence. As the
backlight is now fixed (no low-power mode), it is good to put it back
in the otm8009a_enable() function, avoiding also image glitches visible
on some "slow" devices.
