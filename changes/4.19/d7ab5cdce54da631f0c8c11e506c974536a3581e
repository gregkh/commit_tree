sctp: update dst pmtu with the correct daddr

When processing pmtu update from an icmp packet, it calls .update_pmtu
with sk instead of skb in sctp_transport_update_pmtu.

However for sctp, the daddr in the transport might be different from
inet_sock->inet_daddr or sk->sk_v6_daddr, which is used to update or
create the route cache. The incorrect daddr will cause a different
route cache created for the path.

So before calling .update_pmtu, inet_sock->inet_daddr/sk->sk_v6_daddr
should be updated with the daddr in the transport, and update it back
after it's done.

The issue has existed since route exceptions introduction.
