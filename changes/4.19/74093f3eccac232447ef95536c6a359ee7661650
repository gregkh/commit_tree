drm/i915: Drop posting reads to flush master interrupts

We do not need to do a posting read of our uncached mmio write to
re-enable the master interrupt lines after handling an interrupt, so
don't. This saves us a slow UC read before we can process the interrupt,
most noticeable in execlists where any stalls imposes extra latency on
GPU command execution.
