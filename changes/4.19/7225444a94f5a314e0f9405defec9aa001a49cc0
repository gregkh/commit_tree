staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page d definitions - Style

Remove the unused 'page d' definitions. These definitions fail the
checkpatch CamelCase naming test. Rather then renaming unused
definitions they have simply been removed. This change is a coding
style change and should have no impact on runtime code execution.
