mm, hugetlbfs: rename address to haddr in hugetlb_cow()

To take better advantage of general huge page copying optimization, the
target subpage address will be passed to hugetlb_cow(), then
copy_user_huge_page().  So we will use both target subpage address and
huge page size aligned address in hugetlb_cow().  To distinguish between
them, "haddr" is used for huge page size aligned address to be
consistent with Transparent Huge Page naming convention.

Now, only huge page size aligned address is used in hugetlb_cow(), so
the "address" is renamed to "haddr" in hugetlb_cow() in this patch.
Next patch will use target subpage address in hugetlb_cow() too.

The patch is just code cleanup without any functionality changes.
