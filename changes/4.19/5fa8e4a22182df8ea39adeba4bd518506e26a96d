drm/panel: Make of_drm_find_panel() return an ERR_PTR() instead of NULL

Right now, the DRM panel logic returns NULL when a panel pointing to
the passed OF node is not present in the list of registered panels.

Most drivers interpret this NULL value as -EPROBE_DEFER, but we are
about to modify the semantic of of_drm_find_panel() and let the
framework return -ENODEV when the device node we're pointing to has
a status property that is not equal to "okay" or "ok".

Let's first patch the of_drm_find_panel() implementation to return
ERR_PTR(-EPROBE_DEFER) instead of NULL and patch all callers to replace
the '!panel' check by an 'IS_ERR(panel)' one.
