x86/intel_rdt: Introduce the Cache Pseudo-Locking modes

The two modes used to manage Cache Pseudo-Locked regions are introduced.  A
resource group is assigned "pseudo-locksetup" mode when the user indicates
that this resource group will be used for a Cache Pseudo-Locked
region. When the Cache Pseudo-Locked region has been set up successfully
after the user wrote the requested schemata to the "schemata" file, then
the mode will automatically changed to "pseudo-locked".  The user is not
able to modify the mode to "pseudo-locked" by writing "pseudo-locked" to
the "mode" file directly.
