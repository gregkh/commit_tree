KVM: vmx: skip VMWRITE of HOST_{FS,GS}_BASE when possible

The host's FS.base and GS.base rarely change, e.g. ~0.1% of host/guest
swaps on my system.  Cache the last value written to the VMCS and skip
the VMWRITE to the associated VMCS fields when loading host state if
the value hasn't changed since the last VMWRITE.
