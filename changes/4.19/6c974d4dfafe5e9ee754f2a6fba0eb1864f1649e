EDAC, i7core: Fix memleaks and use-after-free on probe and remove

Make sure to free and deregister the addrmatch and chancounts devices
allocated during probe in all error paths. Also fix use-after-free in a
probe error path and in the remove success path where the devices were
being put before before deregistration.
