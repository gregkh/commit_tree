x86/intel_rdt: Provide pseudo-locking hooks within rdt_mount

Stephen Rothwell reported that the Cache Pseudo-Locking enabling and the
kernfs support for mounting with fs_context are conflicting.

In preparation for a conflict-free merge between the two repos some no-op
hooks are created within the RDT mount function being changed by the two
features. The goal is for this commit to be placed on a minimal no-rebase
branch to be consumed by both features.
