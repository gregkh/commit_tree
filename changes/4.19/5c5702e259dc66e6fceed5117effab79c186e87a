RDMA/core: Set right entry state before releasing reference

Currently add_modify_gid() for IB link layer has followong issue
in cache update path.

When GID update event occurs, core releases reference to the GID
table without updating its state and/or entry pointer.

                                        which has refcnt = 0.
                                   	This is incorrect.

GID entry state and entry pointer is provides the accurate GID enty
state. Such fields must be updated with rwlock to protect against
readers and, such fields must be in sane state before refcount can drop
to zero. Otherwise above race condition can happen leading to
use-after-free situation.

Following backtrace has been observed when cache update for an IB port
is triggered while IPoIB ULP is creating an AH.

Therefore, when updating GID entry, first mark a valid entry as invalid
through state and set the barrier so that no callers can acquired
the GID entry, followed by release reference to it.

refcount_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.
