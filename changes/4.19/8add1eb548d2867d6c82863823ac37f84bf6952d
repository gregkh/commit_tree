staging:rtl8192u: Remove debug member from structures - Style

Two structures, (struct dig and struct dynamic_rx_path_sel) contain
a u8 member variable representing debug setting. In the file r8192U_dm.c
these member variables, for both structures, are initialised to an
enumerated constant 'DM_DBG_OFF'. The member variables are never
assigned another value, other then off. Later in code the member
variables are tested to for equality to 'DM_DBG_OFF' and if that is the
case an assignment statement is executed.

Since the value of the variables is always off the test is redundant and
the conditional branch can just be executed without the test. Since the
member variables are then actually used both have been removed, along
with the enumerated type which defines debug status, on/off.

These are coding style changes to remove unused or redundant code, there
should be no impact on runtime code execution.
