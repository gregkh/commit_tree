drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau: Use pm_runtime_get_noresume() in connector_detect()

It's true we can't resume the device from poll workers in
nouveau_connector_detect(). We can however, prevent the autosuspend
timer from elapsing immediately if it hasn't already without risking any
sort of deadlock with the runtime suspend/resume operations. So do that
instead of entirely avoiding grabbing a power reference.
