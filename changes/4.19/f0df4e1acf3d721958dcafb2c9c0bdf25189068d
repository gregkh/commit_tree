x86/intel_rdt: Fix incorrect loop end condition

A loop is used to check if a CAT resource's CBM of one CLOSID
overlaps with the CBM of another CLOSID of the same resource. The loop
is run over all CLOSIDs supported by the resource.

The problem with running the loop over all CLOSIDs supported by the
resource is that its number of supported CLOSIDs may be more than the
number of supported CLOSIDs on the system, which is the minimum number of
CLOSIDs supported across all resources.

Fix the loop to only consider the number of system supported CLOSIDs,
not all that are supported by the resource.
