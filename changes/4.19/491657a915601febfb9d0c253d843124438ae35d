drm/vc4: Make DSI call into the bridge after the DSI link is enabled.

This allows panels or bridges that need to send DSI commands during
pre_enable() to successfully send them.  We delay DISP0 (aka the
actual display) enabling until after pre_enable so that pixels aren't
streaming before then.

v2: Just clear out the encoder->bridge value to disable the midlayer
    calls (idea by Andrzej Hajda).
