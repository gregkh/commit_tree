drm/i915: Start returning an error from i915_vma_move_to_active()

Handling such a late error in request construction is tricky, but to
accommodate future patches which may allocate here, we potentially could
err. To handle the error after already adjusting global state to track
the new request, we must finish and submit the request. But we don't
want to use the request as not everything is being tracked by it, so we
opt to cancel the commands inside the request.
