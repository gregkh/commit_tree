tracepoint: Fix tracepoint array element size mismatch

commit 46e0c9be206f ("kernel: tracepoints: add support for relative
references") changes the layout of the __tracepoint_ptrs section on
architectures supporting relative references. However, it does so
without turning struct tracepoint * const into const int elsewhere in
the tracepoint code, which has the following side-effect:

Setting mod->num_tracepoints is done in by module.c:

    mod->tracepoints_ptrs = section_objs(info, "__tracepoints_ptrs",
                                         sizeof(*mod->tracepoints_ptrs),
                                         &mod->num_tracepoints);

Basically, since sizeof(*mod->tracepoints_ptrs) is a pointer size
(rather than sizeof(int)), num_tracepoints is erroneously set to half the
size it should be on 64-bit arch. So a module with an odd number of
tracepoints misses the last tracepoint due to effect of integer
division.

So in the module going notifier:

        for_each_tracepoint_range(mod->tracepoints_ptrs,
                mod->tracepoints_ptrs + mod->num_tracepoints,
                tp_module_going_check_quiescent, NULL);

the expression (mod->tracepoints_ptrs + mod->num_tracepoints) actually
evaluates to something within the bounds of the array, but miss the
last tracepoint if the number of tracepoints is odd on 64-bit arch.

Fix this by introducing a new typedef: tracepoint_ptr_t, which
is either "const int" on architectures that have PREL32 relocations,
or "struct tracepoint * const" on architectures that does not have
this feature.

Also provide a new tracepoint_ptr_defer() static inline to
encapsulate deferencing this type rather than duplicate code and
ugly idefs within the for_each_tracepoint_range() implementation.

This issue appears in 4.19-rc kernels, and should ideally be fixed
before the end of the rc cycle.
