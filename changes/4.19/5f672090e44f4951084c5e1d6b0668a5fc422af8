qed: Fix shmem structure inconsistency between driver and the mfw.

The structure shared between driver and the management FW (mfw) differ in
sizes. This would lead to issues when driver try to access the structure
members which are not-aligned with the mfw copy e.g., data_ptr usage in the
case of mfw_tlv request.
Align the driver structure with mfw copy, add reserved field(s) to driver
structure for the members not used by the driver.
