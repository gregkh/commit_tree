l2tp: remove pppol2tp_tunnel_ioctl()

Handle PPPIOCGL2TPSTATS in pppol2tp_ioctl() if the socket represents a
tunnel. This one is a bit special because the caller may use the tunnel
socket to retrieve statistics of one of its sessions. If the session_id
is set, the corresponding session's statistics are returned, instead of
those of the tunnel. This is handled by the new
pppol2tp_tunnel_copy_stats() helper function.

Set ->tunnel_id and ->using_ipsec out of the conditional, so
that it can be used by the 'else' branch in the following patch.
We cannot do that for ->session_id, because tunnel sockets have to
report the value that was originally passed in 'stats.session_id',
while session sockets have to report their own session_id.
