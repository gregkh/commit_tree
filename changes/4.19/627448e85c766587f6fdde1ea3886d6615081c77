tpm: separate cmd_ready/go_idle from runtime_pm

Fix tpm ptt initialization error:
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (378) occurred get tpm pcr allocation.

We cannot use go_idle cmd_ready commands via runtime_pm handles
as with the introduction of localities this is no longer an optional
feature, while runtime pm can be not enabled.
Though cmd_ready/go_idle provides a power saving, it's also a part of
TPM2 protocol and should be called explicitly.
This patch exposes cmd_read/go_idle via tpm class ops and removes
runtime pm support as it is not used by any driver.

When calling from nested context always use both flags:
TPM_TRANSMIT_UNLOCKED and TPM_TRANSMIT_RAW. Both are needed to resolve
tpm spaces and locality request recursive calls to tpm_transmit().
TPM_TRANSMIT_RAW should never be used standalone as it will fail
on double locking. While TPM_TRANSMIT_UNLOCKED standalone should be
called from non-recursive locked contexts.

New wrappers are added tpm_cmd_ready() and tpm_go_idle() to
streamline tpm_try_transmit code.

tpm_crb no longer needs own power saving functions and can drop using
tpm_pm_suspend/resume.

This patch cannot be really separated from the locality fix.
