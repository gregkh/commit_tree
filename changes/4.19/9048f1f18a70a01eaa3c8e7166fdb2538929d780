iio: accel: adxl345: convert address field usage in iio_chan_spec

Currently the address field in iio_chan_spec is filled with an accel
data register address for the corresponding axis.

In preparation for adding calibration offset support, this sets the
address field to the index of accel data registers instead of the actual
register address.

This change makes it easier to access both accel registers and
calibration offset registers with fewer lines of code as these are
located in X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis order.
