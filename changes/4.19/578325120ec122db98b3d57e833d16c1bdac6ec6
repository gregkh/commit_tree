HID: wacom: Move handling of HID quirks into a dedicated function

We want to keep device-specific quirks as contained as possible so that the
the code remains maintainable. Our 'wacom_setup_device_quirks' function is
the usual place for this, but some quirks need to be applied to the HID
descriptor as it is parsed. This commit introduces a new function which is
called for each usage so that any HID-specific quirks can be applied. The
function now houses quirks that were being done in 'wacom_feature_mapping'
and 'wacom_usage_mapping'.
