drm/armada: convert overlay plane to atomic state

The overlay plane support updates asynchronously to the request, but the
drm_plane_helper_update() transitional helper waits for a vblank event
before releasing the framebuffer.  Using the transitional helper would
make the call block, which would introduce a performance regression.

Convert the overlay plane update to use the atomic state structures and
methods for the plane, but implement our own legacy update method
rather than the transitional helper.
