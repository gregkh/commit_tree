mac80211: fix TX status reporting for ieee80211s

TX status reporting to ieee80211s is through ieee80211s_update_metric.
There are two problems about ieee80211s_update_metric:

1. The purpose is to estimate the fail probability
to a specific link. No need to restrict to data frame.

2. Current implementation does not work if wireless driver does not
pass tx_status with skb.

Fix this by removing ieee80211_is_data condition, passing
ieee80211_tx_status directly to ieee80211s_update_metric, and
putting it in both __ieee80211_tx_status and ieee80211_tx_status_ext.
