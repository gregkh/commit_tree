spi: Fix double IDR allocation with DT aliases

If the SPI bus number is provided by a DT alias, idr_alloc() is called
twice, leading to:

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at drivers/spi/spi.c:2179 spi_register_controller+0x11c/0x5d8
    couldn't get idr

Fix this by moving the handling of fixed SPI bus numbers up, before the
DT handling code fills in ctlr->bus_num.
