arm64: dts: Fix various entry-method properties to reflect documentation

The idle-states binding documentation[1] mentions that the
'entry-method' property is required on 64-bit platforms and must be
set to "psci".

commit a13f18f59d26 ("Documentation: arm: Fix typo in the idle-states
bindings examples") attempted to fix this earlier but clearly more is
needed.

Fix the cpu-capacity.txt documentation that uses the incorrect value so
we don't get copy-paste errors like these. Clarify the language in
idle-states.txt by removing the reference to the psci bindings that
might be causing this confusion.

Finally, fix devicetrees of various boards to reflect current
documentation.
