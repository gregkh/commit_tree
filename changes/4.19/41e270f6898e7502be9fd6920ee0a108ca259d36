Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use get/put_cpu() in vmbus_connect()

With CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y, I always see this warning:
BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]

Fix the false warning by using get/put_cpu().

Here vmbus_connect() sends a message to the host and waits for the
host's response. The host will deliver the response message and an
interrupt on CPU msg->target_vcpu, and later the interrupt handler
will wake up vmbus_connect(). vmbus_connect() doesn't really have
to run on the same cpu as CPU msg->target_vcpu, so it's safe to
call put_cpu() just here.
