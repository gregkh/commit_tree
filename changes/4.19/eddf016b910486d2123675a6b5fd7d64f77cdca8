net: ipmr: fix unresolved entry dumps

If the skb space ends in an unresolved entry while dumping we'll miss
some unresolved entries. The reason is due to zeroing the entry counter
between dumping resolved and unresolved mfc entries. We should just
keep counting until the whole table is dumped and zero when we move to
the next as we have a separate table counter.
