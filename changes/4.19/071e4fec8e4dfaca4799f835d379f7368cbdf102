IB/hfi1: Reorg ctxtdata and rightsize fields

Many fields in ctxtdata are incorrectly sized and the organization of the
fields within the structure is a jumble.

Fix by:
- Correcting oversize fields.
- Putting fields common to all contexts at the top with hot fields
  at the top.
- Moving PSM fields to the bottom of the structure.
