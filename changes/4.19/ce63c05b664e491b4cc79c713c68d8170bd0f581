tpm: migrate tpm2_get_random() to use struct tpm_buf

In order to make struct tpm_buf the first class object for constructing
TPM commands, migrate tpm2_get_random() to use it. In addition, removed
remaining references to struct tpm2_cmd. All of them use it to acquire
the length of the response, which can be achieved by using
tpm_buf_length().
