afs: Fix cell proc list

Access to the list of cells by /proc/net/afs/cells has a couple of
problems:

 (1) It should be checking against SEQ_START_TOKEN for the keying the
     header line.

 (2) It's only holding the RCU read lock, so it can't just walk over the
     list without following the proper RCU methods.

Fix these by using an hlist instead of an ordinary list and using the
appropriate accessor functions to follow it with RCU.

Since the code that adds a cell to the list must also necessarily change,
sort the list on insertion whilst we're at it.
