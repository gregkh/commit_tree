iio: chemical: Add support for Bosch BME680 sensor

Bosch BME680 is a 4-in-1 sensor with temperature, pressure, humidity
and gas sensing capability. It supports both I2C and SPI communication
protocol for effective data communication.

The device supports two modes:

1. Sleep mode
2. Forced mode

The measurements only takes place when forced mode is triggered and a
single TPHG cycle is performed by the sensor. The sensor automatically
goes to sleep after afterwards.

The device has various calibration constants/parameters programmed into
devices' non-volatile memory(NVM) during production and can't be altered
by the user. These constants are used in the compensation functions to
get the required compensated readings along with the raw data. The
compensation functions/algorithms are provided by Bosch Sensortec GmbH
via their API[1]. As these don't change during the measurement cycle,
therefore we read and store them at the probe. The default configs
supplied by Bosch are also set at probe.

0-day tested with build success.

Note from Jonathan: The compensation functions are 'interesting' and
could do with a tidy up in future.  However, they work so we can leave that
for another day.
