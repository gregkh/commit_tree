net: ena: fix NULL dereference due to untimely napi initialization

napi poll functions should be initialized before running request_irq(),
to handle a rare condition where there is a pending interrupt, causing
the ISR to fire immediately while the poll function wasn't set yet,
causing a NULL dereference.
