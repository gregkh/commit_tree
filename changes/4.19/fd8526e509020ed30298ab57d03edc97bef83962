drm/i915/execlists: Trust the CSB

Now that we use the CSB stored in the CPU friendly HWSP, we do not need
to track interrupts for when the mmio CSB registers are valid and can
just check where we read up to last from the cached HWSP. This means we
can forgo the atomic bit tracking from interrupt, and in the next patch
it means we can check the CSB at any time.

v2: Change the splitting inside reset_prepare, we only want to lose
testing the interrupt in this patch, the next patch requires the change
in locking
