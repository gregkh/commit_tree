coresight: Introduce support for Coresight Address Translation Unit

Add the initial support for Coresight Address Translation Unit, which
augments the TMC in Coresight SoC-600 by providing an improved Scatter
Gather mechanism. CATU is always connected to a single TMC-ETR and
converts the AXI address with a translated address (from a given SG
table with specific format). The CATU should be programmed in pass
through mode and enabled even if the ETR doesn't use the translation
by CATU.

This patch provides mechanism to enable/disable the CATU always in the
pass through mode.

We reuse the existing ports mechanism to link the TMC-ETR to the
connected CATU.

i.e, TMC-ETR:output_port0 -> CATU:input_port0

Reference manual for CATU component is avilable in version r2p0 of :
"Arm Coresight System-on-Chip SoC-600 Technical Reference Manual".
