fscache: Fix incomplete initialisation of inline key space

The inline key in struct rxrpc_cookie is insufficiently initialized,
zeroing only 3 of the 4 slots, therefore an index_key_len between 13 and 15
bytes will end up hashing uninitialized memory because the memcpy only
partially fills the last buf[] element.

Fix this by clearing fscache_cookie objects on allocation rather than using
the slab constructor to initialise them.  We're going to pretty much fill
in the entire struct anyway, so bringing it into our dcache writably
shouldn't incur much overhead.

This removes the need to do clearance in fscache_set_key() (where we aren't
doing it correctly anyway).

Also, we don't need to set cookie->key_len in fscache_set_key() as we
already did it in the only caller, so remove that.
