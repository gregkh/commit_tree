RDMA/uverbs: Check existence of create_flow callback

In the accepted series "Refactor ib_uverbs_write path", we presented the
roadmap to get rid of uverbs_cmd_mask and uverbs_ex_cmd_mask fields in
favor of simple check of function pointer. So let's put NULL check of
create_flow function callback despite the fact that uverbs_ex_cmd_mask
still exists.
