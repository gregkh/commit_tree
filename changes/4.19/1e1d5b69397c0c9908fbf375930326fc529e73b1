MAINTAINERS: Remove the AT91 clk driver entry

I've stopped actively maintaining this driver for quite some time
already, and at91 maintainers are doing a good job at maintaining it.
Remove the AT91 clk driver entry so that the driver automatically
falls under the "ARM/Microchip (AT91) SoC support" entry.
