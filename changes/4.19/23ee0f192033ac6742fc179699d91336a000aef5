pinctrl: actions: fix unsigned less than zero comparison

The check to see if platform_get_irq failed is performed on the
unsigned value of pctrl->irq[i] and the check is never true because
an unsigned cannot be less than zero.  Fix this by assinging the
signed int ret to the return of platform_get_irq and checking ret
instead.
