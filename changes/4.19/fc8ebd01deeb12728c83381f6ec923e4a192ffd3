block, bfq: return nbytes and not zero from struct cftype .write() method

The value that struct cftype .write() method returns is then directly
returned to userspace as the value returned by write() syscall, so it
should be the number of bytes actually written (or consumed) and not zero.

Returning zero from write() syscall makes programs like /bin/echo or bash
spin.
