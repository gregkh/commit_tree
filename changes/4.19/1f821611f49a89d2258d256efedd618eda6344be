lwt_bpf: remove unnecessary rcu_read_lock in run_lwt_bpf

run_lwt_bpf is called by bpf_{input/output/xmit}.
These functions are already protected by rcu_read_lock.
because lwtunnel_{input/output/xmit} holds rcu_read_lock
and then calls bpf_{input/output/xmit}.
So that rcu_read_lock in the run_lwt_bpf is unnecessary.
