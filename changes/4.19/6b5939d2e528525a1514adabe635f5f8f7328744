MIPS: AR7: Normalize clk API

Coldfire still provides its own variant of the clk API rather than using
the generic COMMON_CLK API.  This generally works, but it causes some
link errors with drivers using the clk_round_rate(), clk_set_rate(),
clk_set_parent(), or clk_get_parent() functions when a platform lacks
those interfaces.

This adds empty stub implementations for each of them, and I don't even
try to do something useful here but instead just print a WARN() message
to make it obvious what is going on if they ever end up being called.

The drivers that call these won't be used on these platforms (otherwise
we'd get a link error today), so the added code is harmless bloat and
will warn about accidental use.

Based on commit bd7fefe1f06ca6cc ("ARM: w90x900: normalize clk API").
