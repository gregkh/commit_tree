RISC-V: Don't use a global include guard for uapi/asm/syscalls.h

This file is expected to be included multiple times in the same file in
order to allow the __SYSCALL macro to generate system call tables.  With
a global include guard we end up missing __NR_riscv_flush_icache in the
syscall table, which results in icache flushes that escape the vDSO call
to not actually do anything.

The fix is to move to per-#define include guards, which allows the
system call tables to actually be populated.  Thanks to Macrus Comstedt
for finding and fixing the bug!
