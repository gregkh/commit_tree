staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef of u32 to QOS_MODE - Style

The typedef of QOS_MODE as a u32 is contrary to coding standard and fails
the checkpatch tests for defining new types in code. Definitions of type
QOS_MODE have simply been replaced with a u32 type.

This is a coding style change which should not impact runtime execution.
