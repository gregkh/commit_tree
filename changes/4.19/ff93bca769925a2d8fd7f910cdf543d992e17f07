ila: make lockdep happy again

Previously, alloc_ila_locks() and bucket_table_alloc() call
spin_lock_init() separately, therefore they have two different
lock names and lock class keys. However, after commit b893281715ab
("ila: Call library function alloc_bucket_locks") they both call
helper alloc_bucket_spinlocks() which now only has one lock
name and lock class key. This causes a few bogus lockdep warnings
as reported by syzbot.

Fix this by making alloc_bucket_locks() a macro and pass declaration
name as lock name and a static lock class key inside the macro.

Fixes: b893281715ab ("ila: Call library function alloc_bucket_locks")
