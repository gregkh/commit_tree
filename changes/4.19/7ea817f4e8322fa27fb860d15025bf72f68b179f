tipc: check session number before accepting link protocol messages

In some virtual environments we observe a significant higher number of
packet reordering and delays than we have been used to traditionally.

This makes it necessary with stricter checks on incoming link protocol
messages' session number, which until now only has been validated for
RESET messages.

Since the other two message types, ACTIVATE and STATE messages also
carry this number, it is easy to extend the validation check to those
messages.

We also introduce a flag indicating if a link has a valid peer session
number or not. This eliminates the mixing of 32- and 16-bit arithmethics
we are currently using to achieve this.
