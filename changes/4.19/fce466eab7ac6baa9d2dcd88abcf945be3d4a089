btrfs: tree-checker: Verify block_group_item

A crafted image with invalid block group items could make free space cache
code to cause panic.

We could detect such invalid block group item by checking:
1) Item size
   Known fixed value.
2) Block group size (key.offset)
   We have an upper limit on block group item (10G)
3) Chunk objectid
   Known fixed value.
4) Type
   Only 4 valid type values, DATA, METADATA, SYSTEM and DATA|METADATA.
   No more than 1 bit set for profile type.
5) Used space
   No more than the block group size.

This should allow btrfs to detect and refuse to mount the crafted image.
