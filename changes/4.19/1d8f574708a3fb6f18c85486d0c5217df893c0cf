arm/arm64: smccc-1.1: Make return values unsigned long

An unfortunate consequence of having a strong typing for the input
values to the SMC call is that it also affects the type of the
return values, limiting r0 to 32 bits and r{1,2,3} to whatever
was passed as an input.

Let's turn everything into "unsigned long", which satisfies the
requirements of both architectures, and allows for the full
range of return values.
