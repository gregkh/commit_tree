btrfs: Deduplicate extent_buffer init code

When a new extent buffer is allocated there are a few mandatory fields
which need to be set in order for the buffer to be sane: level,
generation, bytenr, backref_rev, owner and FSID/UUID. Currently this
is open coded in the callers of btrfs_alloc_tree_block, meaning it's
fairly high in the abstraction hierarchy of operations. This patch
solves this by simply moving this init code in btrfs_init_new_buffer,
since this is the function which initializes a newly allocated
extent buffer. No functional changes.
