block: Track DISCARD statistics and output them in stat and diskstat

Add tracking of REQ_OP_DISCARD ios to the partition statistics and
append them to the various stat files in /sys as well as
/proc/diskstats.  These are tracked with the same four stats as reads
and writes:

Number of discard ios completed.
Number of discard ios merged
Number of discard sectors completed
Milliseconds spent on discard requests

This is done via adding a new STAT_DISCARD define to genhd.h and then
using it to index that stat field for discard requests.

tj: Refreshed on top of v4.17 and other previous updates.
