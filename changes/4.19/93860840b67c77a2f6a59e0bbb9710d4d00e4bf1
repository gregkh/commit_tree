staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused RTL8258 definitions - Style

Remove the unused RTL8258 definitions. These definitions fail the checkpatch
CamelCase naming test, rather then renaming, as the definitions are unused
they have simply been removed. This is a coding style change which should
not impact runtime code execution.
