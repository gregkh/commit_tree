drm/i915/execlists: Pull the w/a LRI emission into a helper

Having the w/a registers as an open-coded table leaves a trap for the
unwary; it would be easy to miss incrementing the LRI counter when
adding a new register to the list. Instead, pull the list of registers
into a table, so that we only need add new registers to that table
rather than try and remember important side-effects of earlier chunks of
GPU instructions.
