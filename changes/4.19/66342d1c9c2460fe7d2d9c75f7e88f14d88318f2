platform/mellanox: mlxreg-hotplug: Improve mechanism of ASIC health discovery

Simplify the logic of ASIC health discovery.
ASIC device can indicate its health state as a good, booting or dormant.
During ASIC reset the device is dropped to dormant state and should get to
the stable good health state through the intermediate booting state.
The sequence for getting to the steady state health after reset is:
(dormant -> booting -> good)+.
Initial implementation assumes that ?good? within this sequence is always
repeated twice and device is getting steady state only after the second
?good?. This patch removes this dependency, since the second ?good? is
received because of the noise on line and can be ignored. Device reaches
steady state after the first ?good? is received.
