bpf, sockmap: fix sock_hash_alloc and reject zero-sized keys

Currently, it is possible to create a sock hash map with key size
of 0 and have the kernel return a fd back to user space. This is
invalid for hash maps (and kernel also hasn't been tested for zero
key size support in general at this point). Thus, reject such
configuration.
