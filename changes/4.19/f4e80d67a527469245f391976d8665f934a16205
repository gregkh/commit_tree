x86/intel_rdt: Resctrl files reflect pseudo-locked information

Information about resources as well as resource groups are contained in a
variety of resctrl files. Now that pseudo-locked regions can be created the
files can be updated to present appropriate information to the user.

Update the resource group's schemata file to show only the information of
the pseudo-locked region.

Update the resource group's size file to show the size in bytes of only the
pseudo-locked region.

Update the bit_usage file to use the letter 'P' for all pseudo-locked
regions.
