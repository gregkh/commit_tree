mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Split TCAM handling 3 ways

To allow easy and clean Spectrum-2 implementation for things that differ
from Spectrum, split the existing ACL TCAM code 3 ways:
1) common code that calls Spectrum/Spectrum-2 specific ops
2) Spectrum ops implementations
3) common C-TCAM code that is going to be shared between Spectrum and
   Spectrum-2 implementations
