r8169: don't use MSI-X on RTL8168g

There have been two reports that network doesn't come back on resume
from suspend when using MSI-X. Both cases affect the same chip version
(RTL8168g - version 40), on different systems. Falling back to MSI
fixes the issue.
Even though we don't really have a proof yet that the network chip
version is to blame, let's disable MSI-X for this version.
