staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page a definitions - Style

Remove unused 'page a' definitions. These definitions fail the checkpatch
CamelCase naming test, rather then renaming these unused definitions they
have simply been removed. This is a coding style change only, and should
have no impact on runtime code execution.
