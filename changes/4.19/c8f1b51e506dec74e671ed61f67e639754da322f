iwlwifi: allow different csr flags for different device families

Different device families may have different flag values
for passing a message to the fw (i.e. SW_RESET).
In order to keep the code readable, and avoid conditioning
upon the family, store a value for each flag, which indicates
the bit that needs to be enabled.

Additionally, support 22560 device csr flags and addresses.
