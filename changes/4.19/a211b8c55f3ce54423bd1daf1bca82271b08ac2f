ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabreauto: Add sensors

The following sensors are on I2C3 on the baseboard:
* isil,isl29023 light sensor
* fsl,mag3110 magnetometer
* fsl,mma8451 accelerometer

Added under i2cmux/i2c@1 because they're not otherwise accessible.

These are all supported by iio with following configs:
* CONFIG_SENSORS_ISL29018
* CONFIG_MAG3110
* CONFIG_MMA8452

Tested with raw reads from iio sysfs.
