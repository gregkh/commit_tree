powerpc/powernv: move opal console flushing to udbg

OPAL console writes do not have to synchronously flush firmware /
hardware buffers unless they are going through the udbg path.

Remove the unconditional flushing from opal_put_chars. Flush if
there was no space in the buffer as an optimisation (callers loop
waiting for success in that case). udbg flushing is moved to
udbg_opal_putc.
