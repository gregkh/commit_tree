sch_cake: Add overhead compensation support to the rate shaper

This commit adds configurable overhead compensation support to the rate
shaper. With this feature, userspace can configure the actual bottleneck
link overhead and encapsulation mode used, which will be used by the shaper
to calculate the precise duration of each packet on the wire.

This feature is needed because CAKE is often deployed one or two hops
upstream of the actual bottleneck (which can be, e.g., inside a DSL or
cable modem). In this case, the link layer characteristics and overhead
reported by the kernel does not match the actual bottleneck. Being able to
set the actual values in use makes it possible to configure the shaper rate
much closer to the actual bottleneck rate (our experience shows it is
possible to get with 0.1% of the actual physical bottleneck rate), thus
keeping latency low without sacrificing bandwidth.

The overhead compensation has three tunables: A fixed per-packet overhead
size (which, if set, will be accounted from the IP packet header), a
minimum packet size (MPU) and a framing mode supporting either ATM or PTM
framing. We include a set of common keywords in TC to help users configure
the right parameters. If no overhead value is set, the value reported by
the kernel is used.
