shmem: use monotonic time for i_generation

get_seconds() is deprecated because it will lead to a 32-bit overflow in
2038 or 2106.  We don't need the i_generation to be strictly monotonic
anyway, and other file systems like ext4 and xfs just use prandom_u32(),
so let's use the same one here.

If this is considered too slow, we could also use ktime_get_seconds() or
ktime_get_real_seconds() to keep the previous behavior.  Both of these
return a time64_t and are not deprecated, but only return a unique value
once per second, and are predictable.
