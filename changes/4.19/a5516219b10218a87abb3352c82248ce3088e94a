of/platform: Initialise default DMA masks

When of_dma_configure() was first born in 591c1ee465ce ("of: configure
the platform device dma parameters"), everything DMA-related was
factored out of of_platform_device_create_pdata() as seemed appropriate
at the time. However, now that of_dma_configure() has grown into the
generic handler for processing DMA-related properties from DT for all
kinds of devices, it is no longer an appropriate place to be doing
OF-platform-specific business. Since there are still plenty of platform
drivers not setting their own masks and depending on the bus default,
let's reinstate that inialisation in the OF-platform code itself, and
restore the long-standing status quo from 0589342c2794 ("of: set
dma_mask to point to coherent_dma_mask")
