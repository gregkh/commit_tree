netfilter: fix memory leaks on netlink_dump_start error

Shaochun Chen points out we leak dumper filter state allocations
stored in dump_control->data in case there is an error before netlink sets
cb_running (after which ->done will be called at some point).

In order to fix this, add .start functions and move allocations there.

Same pattern as used in commit 90fd131afc565159c9e0ea742f082b337e10f8c6
("netfilter: nf_tables: move dumper state allocation into ->start").
