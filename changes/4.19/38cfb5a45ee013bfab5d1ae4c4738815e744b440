blk-wbt: improve waking of tasks

We have two potential issues:

1) After commit 2887e41b910b, we only wake one process at the time when
   we finish an IO. We really want to wake up as many tasks as can
   queue IO. Before this commit, we woke up everyone, which could cause
   a thundering herd issue.

2) A task can potentially consume two wakeups, causing us to (in
   practice) miss a wakeup.

Fix both by providing our own wakeup function, which stops
__wake_up_common() from waking up more tasks if we fail to get a
queueing token. With the strict ordering we have on the wait list, this
wakes the right tasks and the right amount of tasks.

Based on a patch from Jianchao Wang <jianchao.w.wang@oracle.com>.
