audit: rename FILTER_TYPE to FILTER_EXCLUDE

The AUDIT_FILTER_TYPE name is vague and misleading due to not describing
where or when the filter is applied and obsolete due to its available
filter fields having been expanded.

Userspace has already renamed it from AUDIT_FILTER_TYPE to
AUDIT_FILTER_EXCLUDE without checking if it already exists.  The
userspace maintainer assures that as long as it is set to the same value
it will not be a problem since the userspace code does not treat
compiler warnings as errors.  If this policy changes then checks if it
already exists can be added at the same time.
