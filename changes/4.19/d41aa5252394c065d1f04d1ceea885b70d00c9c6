mm: madvise(MADV_DODUMP): allow hugetlbfs pages

Reproducer, assuming 2M of hugetlbfs available:

Hugetlbfs mounted, size=2M and option user=testuser

  # mount | grep ^hugetlbfs
  hugetlbfs on /dev/hugepages type hugetlbfs (rw,pagesize=2M,user=dan)
  # sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=1
  vm.nr_hugepages = 1
  # grep Huge /proc/meminfo
  AnonHugePages:         0 kB
  ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
  HugePages_Total:       1
  HugePages_Free:        1
  HugePages_Rsvd:        0
  HugePages_Surp:        0
  Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
  Hugetlb:            2048 kB

Code:

  #include <sys/mman.h>
  #include <stddef.h>
  #define SIZE 2*1024*1024
  int main()
  {
    void *ptr;
    ptr = mmap(NULL, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_HUGETLB | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    madvise(ptr, SIZE, MADV_DONTDUMP);
    madvise(ptr, SIZE, MADV_DODUMP);
  }

Compile and strace:

  mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_HUGETLB, -1, 0) = 0x7ff7c9200000
  madvise(0x7ff7c9200000, 2097152, MADV_DONTDUMP) = 0
  madvise(0x7ff7c9200000, 2097152, MADV_DODUMP) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

hugetlbfs pages have VM_DONTEXPAND in the VmFlags driver pages based on
author testing with analysis from Florian Weimer[1].

The inclusion of VM_DONTEXPAND into the VM_SPECIAL defination was a
consequence of the large useage of VM_DONTEXPAND in device drivers.

A consequence of [2] is that VM_DONTEXPAND marked pages are unable to be
marked DODUMP.

A user could quite legitimately madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP) their hugetlbfs
memory for a while and later request that madvise(MADV_DODUMP) on the same
memory.  We correct this omission by allowing madvice(MADV_DODUMP) on
hugetlbfs pages.
