ALSA: update dell-wmi mic-mute registration to new world order

Commit c647f806b8c2 ("ALSA: hda - Allow multiple ADCs for mic mute LED
controls") changed the return value of the snd_hda_gen_add_micmute_led()
without actually updating the callers.

Admittedly, almost no callers actually cared about the return value.
But one call site very much did: the Dell wmi code.  It would see the
registration return zero, which _used_ to mean "failed" but now means
"success", and clear the dell_micmute_led_set_func pointer.

End result: the successful registration would end up calling the Dell
code that thought it had all failed, and call through a NULL pointer.

To make matters worse, it ends up being a tail-call, and with the
retpoline sequence you don't even see the caller (dell_micmute_update())
in the stack trace, so the error ended up way less obvious than it
should have been.
