mtd: rawnand: mxc: remove __init qualifier from mxcnd_probe_dt

Using the sysfs unbind, bind nodes, mxcnd_probe and mxcnd_probe_dt can
potentially be called at any time. After the __init functions are cleaned,
mxcnd_probe_dt is no longer available. Calling it anyway causes a crash.

mxcnd_probe used to be marked as __init, this was removed years ago.
Remove the __init qualifier from from mxcnd_probe_dt as well.
