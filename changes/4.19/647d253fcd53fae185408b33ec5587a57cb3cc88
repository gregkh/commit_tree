ovl: Add helper ovl_dentry_lowerdata() to get lower data dentry

Now we have the notion of data dentry and metacopy dentry.
ovl_dentry_lower() will return uppermost lower dentry, but it could be
either data or metacopy dentry.  Now we support metacopy dentries in lower
layers so it is possible that lowerstack[0] is metacopy dentry while
lowerstack[1] is actual data dentry.

So add an helper which returns lowest most dentry which is supposed to be
data dentry.
