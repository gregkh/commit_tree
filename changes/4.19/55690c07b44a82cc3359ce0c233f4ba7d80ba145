pktcdvd: Fix possible Spectre-v1 for pkt_devs

User controls @dev_minor which to be used as index of pkt_devs.
So, It can be exploited via Spectre-like attack. (speculative execution)

This kind of attack leaks address of pkt_devs, [1]
It leads an attacker to bypass security mechanism such as KASLR.

So sanitize @dev_minor before using it to prevent attack.
