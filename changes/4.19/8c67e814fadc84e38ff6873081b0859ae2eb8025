staging: wilc1000: remove extra enums defined for ieee80211_eid

Cleanup patch to make use of existing enum 'ieee80211_eid' instead of
adding new enum in WILC for element ID's.

The below mapping is same to remove extra enum in WILC.

SUPP_RATES_IE   	-> WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES
EXT_SUPP_RATES_IE	-> WLAN_EID_EXT_SUPP_RATES
HT_CAPABILITY_IE	-> WLAN_EID_HT_CAPABILITY
RSN_IE			-> WLAN_EID_RSN
WPA_IE			-> WLAN_EID_VENDOR_SPECIFIC
WMM_IE			-> WLAN_EID_VENDOR_SPECIFIC
P2P_IE			-> WLAN_EID_VENDOR_SPECIFIC

Also remove enum 'info_element_id' as its same as 'ieee80211_eid', below
the mapping of elements of enums which are used.

ITIM -> WLAN_EID_TIM
IDSPARMS -> WLAN_EID_DS_PARAMS
