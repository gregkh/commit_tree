xfs: remove xfs_defer_init() firstblock param

All but one caller of xfs_defer_init() passes in the ->t_firstblock
of the associated transaction. The one outlier is
xlog_recover_process_intents(), which simply passes a dummy value
because a valid pointer is required. This firstblock variable can
simply be removed.

At this point we could remove the xfs_defer_init() firstblock
parameter and initialize ->t_firstblock directly. Even that is not
necessary, however, because ->t_firstblock is automatically
reinitialized in the new transaction on a transaction roll. Since
xfs_defer_init() should never occur more than once on a particular
transaction (since the corresponding finish will roll it), replace
the reinit from xfs_defer_init() with an assert that verifies the
transaction has a NULLFSBLOCK firstblock.
