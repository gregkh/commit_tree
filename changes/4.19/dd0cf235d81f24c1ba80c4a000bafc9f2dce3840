drm/i915: Speed up idle detection by kicking the tasklets

We rely on ksoftirqd to run in a timely fashion in order to drain the
execlists queue. Quite frequently, it does not. In some cases we may see
latencies of over 200ms triggering our idle timeouts and forcing us to
declare the driver wedged!

Thus we can speed up idle detection by bypassing ksoftirqd in these
cases and flush our tasklet to confirm if we are indeed still waiting
for the ELSP to drain.

v2: Put the execlists.first check back; it is required for handling
reset!
