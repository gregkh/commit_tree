RDMA/uverbs: Store the specs_root in the struct ib_uverbs_device

The specs are required to operate the uverbs file, so they belong inside
the ib_uverbs_device, not inside the ib_device. The spec passed in the
ib_device is just a communication from the driver and should not be used
during runtime.

This also changes the lifetime of the spec memory to match the
ib_uverbs_device, however at this time the spec_root can still contain
driver pointers after disassociation, so it cannot be used if ib_dev is
NULL. This is preparation for another series.
