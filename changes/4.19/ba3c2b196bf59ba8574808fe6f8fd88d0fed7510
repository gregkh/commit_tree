btrfs: Add graceful handling of V0 extents

Following the removal of the v0 handling code let's be courteous and
print an error message when such extents are handled. In the cases
where we have a transaction just abort it, otherwise just call
btrfs_handle_fs_error. Both cases result in the FS being re-mounted RO.

In case the error handling would be too intrusive, leave the BUG_ON in
place, like extent_data_ref_count, other proper handling would catch
that earlier.
