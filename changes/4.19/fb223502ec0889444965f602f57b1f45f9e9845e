tcp: add SNMP counter for zero-window drops

It will be helpful if we could display the drops due to zero window or no
enough window space.
So a new SNMP MIB entry is added to track this behavior.
This entry is named LINUX_MIB_TCPZEROWINDOWDROP and published in
/proc/net/netstat in TcpExt line as TCPZeroWindowDrop.
