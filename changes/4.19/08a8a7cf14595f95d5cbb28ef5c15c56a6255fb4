HID: core: do not upper bound the collection stack

Looks like 4 was sufficient until now. However, the Surface Dial needs
a stack of 5 and simply fails at probing.
Dynamically add HID_COLLECTION_STACK_SIZE to the size of the stack if
we hit the upper bound.

Checkpatch complains about bare unsigned, so converting those to
'unsigned int' in struct hid_parser
