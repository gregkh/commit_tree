MIPS: Always specify -EB or -EL when using clang

When building using clang, always specify -EB or -EL in order to ensure
we target the desired endianness.

Since clang cross compiles using a single compiler build with multiple
targets, our -dumpmachine tests which don't specify clang's --target
argument check output based upon the build machine rather than the
machine our build will target. This means our detection of whether to
specify -EB fails miserably & we never do. Providing the endianness flag
unconditionally for clang resolves this issue & simplifies the clang
path somewhat.
