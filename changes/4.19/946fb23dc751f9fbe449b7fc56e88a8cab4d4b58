staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused RF Zebra1 Bit Mask definitions - Style

Remove the unused 'RF Zebra1' bit mask definitions. These definitions
fail the checkpatch CamelCase naming tests. Since the definitions are
unused in code they have simply been removed, rather then renaming.

This is a coding style change which will have no impact on runtime code
execution.
