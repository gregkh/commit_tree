tools: libbpf: restore the ability to load programs from .text section

libbpf used to be able to load programs from the default section
called '.text'.  It's not very common to leave sections unnamed,
but if it happens libbpf will fail to load the programs reporting
-EINVAL from the kernel.  The -EINVAL comes from bpf_obj_name_cpy()
because since 48cca7e44f9f ("libbpf: add support for bpf_call")
libbpf does not resolve program names for programs in '.text',
defaulting to '.text'.  '.text', however, does not pass the
(isalnum(*src) || *src == '_') check in bpf_obj_name_cpy().

With few extra lines of code we can limit the pseudo call
assumptions only to objects which actually contain code relocations.
