tty: serial: lpuart: avoid leaking struct tty_struct

The function tty_port_tty_get() gets a reference to the tty. Since
the code is not using tty_port_tty_set(), the reference is kept
even after closing the tty.

Avoid using tty_port_tty_get() by directly access the tty instance.
Since lpuart_start_rx_dma() is called from the .startup() and
.set_termios() callback, it is safe to assume the tty instance is
valid.
