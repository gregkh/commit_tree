qed: Add Multi-TC RoCE support

RoCE qps use a pair of physical queues (pq) received from the Queue Manager
(QM) - an offload queue (OFLD) and a low latency queue (LLT). The QM block
creates a pq for each TC, and allows RoCE qps to ask for a pq with a
specific TC. As a result, qps with different VLAN priorities can be mapped
to different TCs, and employ features such as PFC and ETS.
