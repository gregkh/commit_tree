KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Add core support for Group0 SGIs

Although vgic-v3 now supports Group0 interrupts, it still doesn't
deal with Group0 SGIs. As usually with the GIC, nothing is simple:

- ICC_SGI1R can signal SGIs of both groups, since GICD_CTLR.DS==1
  with KVM (as per 8.1.10, Non-secure EL1 access)

- ICC_SGI0R can only generate Group0 SGIs

- ICC_ASGI1R sees its scope refocussed to generate only Group0
  SGIs (as per the note at the bottom of Table 8-14)

We only support Group1 SGIs so far, so no material change.
