inet: make sure to grab rcu_read_lock before using ireq->ireq_opt

Timer handlers do not imply rcu_read_lock(), so my recent fix
triggered a LOCKDEP warning when SYNACK is retransmit.

Lets add rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() pairs around ireq->ireq_opt
usages instead of guessing what is done by callers, since it is
not worth the pain.

Get rid of ireq_opt_deref() helper since it hides the logic
without real benefit, since it is now a standard rcu_dereference().
