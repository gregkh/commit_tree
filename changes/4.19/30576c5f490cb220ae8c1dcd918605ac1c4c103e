HID: microsoft: support the Surface Dial

The tool works nicely with hid-generic, but it ends up creating 9
different input nodes with most of them only having ABS_MISC set.

Filter the axis out, which reduces the amount of devices to 2. One is
the proper System Multi-axis collection, the other exported device
seems to provide SLEEP and POWER Key, not sure how one can trigger
those events though.

Filtering the ABS_X and ABS_Y axes also prevents udev to detect this as
a touchscreen.
