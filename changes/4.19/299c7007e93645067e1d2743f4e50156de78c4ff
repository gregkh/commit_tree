media: dw2102: Fix memleak on sequence of probes

Each call to dw2102_probe() allocates memory by kmemdup for structures
p1100, s660, p7500 and s421, but there is no their deallocation.
dvb_usb_device_init() copies the corresponding structure into
dvb_usb_device->props, so there is no use of original structure after
dvb_usb_device_init().

The patch moves structures from global scope to local and adds their
deallocation.
