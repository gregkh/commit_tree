s390/cio: ensure that a chpid is registered only once

Improve locking in chp_new to make sure that we don't register
the same chpid twice. Chpid registration was synchronized via
the machine check handler thread but we also have codepaths to
look for new chpids triggered independent of that thread (during
IPL or resume from hibernate).
