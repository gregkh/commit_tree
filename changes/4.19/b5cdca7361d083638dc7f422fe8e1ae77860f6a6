Kbuild: Makefile.modbuiltin: include auto.conf and tristate.conf mandatory

The files auto.conf and tristate.conf are mandatory for building
modules.builtin files, therefore include them as such.

Usually, the top-level Makefile ensures that those files exist but we
want to make sure we get noticed if they are missing for whatever
reason.
