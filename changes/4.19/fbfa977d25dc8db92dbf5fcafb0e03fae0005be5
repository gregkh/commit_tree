xfs: use transaction for intent recovery instead of raw dfops

Log intent recovery is the last user of an external (on-stack)
dfops. The pattern exists because the dfops is used to collect
additional deferred operations queued during the whole recovery
sequence. The dfops is finished with a new transaction after intent
recovery completes.

We already have a mechanism to create an empty, container-like
transaction to support the scrub infrastructure. We can reuse that
mechanism here to drop the final user of external dfops. This
facilitates folding dfops state (i.e., dop_low) into the
transaction, the elimination of now unused external dfops support
and also eliminates the only caller of __xfs_defer_cancel().

Replace the on-stack dfops with an empty transaction and pass it
around to the various helpers that queue and finish deferred
operations during intent recovery.
