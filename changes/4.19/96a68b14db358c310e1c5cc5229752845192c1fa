MIPS: Remove nabi_no_regargs

Our sigreturn functions make use of a macro named nabi_no_regargs to
declare 8 dummy arguments to a function, forcing the compiler to expect
a pt_regs structure on the stack rather than in argument registers. This
is an ugly hack which unnecessarily causes these sigreturn functions to
need to care about the calling convention of the ABI the kernel is built
for. Although this is abstracted via nabi_no_regargs, it's still ugly &
unnecessary.

Remove nabi_no_regargs & the struct pt_regs argument from sigreturn
functions, and instead use current_pt_regs() to find the struct pt_regs
on the stack, which works cleanly regardless of ABI.
