media: arch: sh: ap325rxa: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver

Use the new renesas-ceu camera driver in ap325rxa board file instead of
the soc_camera based sh_mobile_ceu_camera driver.

Get rid of soc_camera specific components, and register CEU0 with a single
video sensor (ov7725).

Memory for the CEU video buffers is now reserved with membocks APIs
and need to be declared as dma_coherent during machine initialization to
remove that architecture specific part from CEU driver.

The ap325rxa board file registers another camera (ncm03j) for which I found no
driver in mainline kernel version, and that was configured/probed by sending
i2c messages (of 'magic blobs) from the board file itself. I removed the
sensor registration from this new version as it used soc_camera components
that will be later removed.

While at there update license to SPDX header and sort headers alphabetically.

Compile tested only.
