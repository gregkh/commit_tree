y2038: Provide aliases for compat helpers

As part of the system call rework for 64-bit time_t, we are restructuring
the way that compat syscalls deal with 32-bit time_t, reusing the
implementation for 32-bit architectures. Christoph Hellwig suggested a
rename of the associated types and interfaces to avoid the confusing usage
of the 'compat' prefix for 32-bit architectures.

To prepare for doing that in linux-4.20, add a set of macros that allows to
convert subsystems separately to the new names and avoids some of the
nastier merge conflicts.
