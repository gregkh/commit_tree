net: Add support for subordinate device traffic classes

This patch is meant to provide the basic tools needed to allow us to create
subordinate device traffic classes. The general idea here is to allow
subdividing the queues of a device into queue groups accessible through an
upper device such as a macvlan.

The idea here is to enforce the idea that an upper device has to be a
single queue device, ideally with IFF_NO_QUQUE set. With that being the
case we can pretty much guarantee that the tc_to_txq mappings and XPS maps
for the upper device are unused. As such we could reuse those in order to
support subdividing the lower device and distributing those queues between
the subordinate devices.

In order to distinguish between a regular set of traffic classes and if a
device is carrying subordinate traffic classes I changed num_tc from a u8
to a s16 value and use the negative values to represent the subordinate
pool values. So starting at -1 and running to -32768 we can encode those as
pool values, and the existing values of 0 to 15 can be maintained.
