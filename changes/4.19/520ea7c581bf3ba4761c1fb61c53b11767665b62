drm/i915: Prepare for non-object vma

In order to allow ourselves to use VMA to wrap other entities other than
GEM objects, we need to allow for the vma->obj backpointer to be NULL.
In most cases, we know we are operating on a GEM object and its vma, but
we need the core code (such as i915_vma_pin/insert/bind/unbind) to work
regardless of the innards.

The remaining eyesore here is vma->obj->cache_level and related (but
less of an issue) vma->obj->gt_ro. With a bit of care we should mirror
those on the vma itself.
