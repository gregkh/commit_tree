powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Reduce upper limit for DMA window size

We use PHB in mode1 which uses bit 59 to select a correct DMA window.
However there is mode2 which uses bits 59:55 and allows up to 32 DMA
windows per a PE.

Even though documentation does not clearly specify that, it seems that
the actual hardware does not support bits 59:55 even in mode1, in other
words we can create a window as big as 1<<58 but DMA simply won't work.

This reduces the upper limit from 59 to 55 bits to let the userspace know
about the hardware limits.
