drivers: qcom: rpmh: add support for batch RPMH request

Platform drivers need make a lot of resource state requests at the same
time, say, at the start or end of an usecase. It can be quite
inefficient to send each request separately. Instead they can give the
RPMH library a batch of requests to be sent and wait on the whole
transaction to be complete.

rpmh_write_batch() is a blocking call that can be used to send multiple
RPMH command sets. Each RPMH command set is set asynchronously and the
API blocks until all the command sets are complete and receive their
tx_done callbacks.
