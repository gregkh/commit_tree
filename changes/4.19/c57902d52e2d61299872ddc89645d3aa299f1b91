macintosh/via-pmu: Enhance state machine with new 'uninitialized' state

On 68k Macs, the via/vias pointer can't be used to determine whether
the PMU driver has been initialized. For portability, add a new state
to indicate that via_find_pmu() succeeded.

After via_find_pmu() executes, testing vias == NULL is equivalent to
testing via == NULL. Replace these tests with pmu_state == uninitialized
which is simpler and more consistent. No functional change.
