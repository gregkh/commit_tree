staging: erofs: introduce a customized LZ4 decompression

We have to reduce the memory cost as much as possible,
so we don't want to decompress more data beyond
the output buffer size, however "LZ4_decompress_safe_partial"
doesn't guarantee to stop at the arbitary end position,
but stop just after its current LZ4 "sequence" is completed.

Therefore, I hacked the LZ4 decompression logic by hand,
probably NOT the fastest approach, and hope for better
implementation.
