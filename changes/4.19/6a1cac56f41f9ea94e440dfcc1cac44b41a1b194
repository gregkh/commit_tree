x86/kvm: Use __bss_decrypted attribute in shared variables

The recent removal of the memblock dependency from kvmclock caused a SEV
guest regression because the wall_clock and hv_clock_boot variables are
no longer mapped decrypted when SEV is active.

Use the __bss_decrypted attribute to put the static wall_clock and
hv_clock_boot in the .bss..decrypted section so that they are mapped
decrypted during boot.

In the preparatory stage of CPU hotplug, the per-cpu pvclock data pointer
assigns either an element of the static array or dynamically allocated
memory for the pvclock data pointer. The static array are now mapped
decrypted but the dynamically allocated memory is not mapped decrypted.
However, when SEV is active this memory range must be mapped decrypted.

Add a function which is called after the page allocator is up, and
allocate memory for the pvclock data pointers for the all possible cpus.
Map this memory range as decrypted when SEV is active.
