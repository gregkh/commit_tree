docs/core-api: split memory management API to a separate file

This is basically copy-paste of the memory management section from
kernel-api.rst with some minor adjustments:

* The "User Space Memory Access" is moved to the beginning
* The get_user_pages_fast reference is now a part of "User Space Memory
  Access"
* And, of course, headings are adjusted with section being promoted to
  chapters
