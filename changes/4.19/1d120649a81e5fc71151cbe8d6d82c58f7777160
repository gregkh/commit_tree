media: m2m-deinterlace: Implement wait_prepare and wait_finish

This driver is currently specifying a video_device lock,
which means it is protecting all the ioctls (including
queue ioctls) with a single mutex.

It's therefore straightforward to implement wait_prepare
and wait_finish, by explicitly setting the vb2_queue lock.

Having these callbacks releases the queue lock while blocking,
which improves latency by allowing for example streamoff
or qbuf operations while waiting in dqbuf.
