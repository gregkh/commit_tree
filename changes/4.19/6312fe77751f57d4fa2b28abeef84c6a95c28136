net: limit each hash list length to MAX_GRO_SKBS

After commit 07d78363dcff ("net: Convert NAPI gro list into a small hash
table.")' there is 8 hash buckets, which allows more flows to be held for
merging.  but MAX_GRO_SKBS, the total held skb for merging, is 8 skb still,
limit the hash table performance.

keep MAX_GRO_SKBS as 8 skb, but limit each hash list length to 8 skb, not
the total 8 skb
