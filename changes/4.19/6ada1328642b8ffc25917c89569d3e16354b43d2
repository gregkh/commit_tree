gpu: drm: omapdrm: Adding new typedef vm_fault_t

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler. For
now, this is just documenting that the function returns
a VM_FAULT value rather than an errno. Once all instances
are converted, vm_fault_t will become a distinct type.

Ref-> commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

Previously vm_insert_mixed() returns err which driver
mapped into VM_FAULT_* type. Also return value of
vm_insert_mixed() not handled correctly and 0 was
returned inside fault_2d() as default. The new function
vmf_insert_mixed() will replace this inefficiency by
returning correct VM_FAULT_* type.

vmf_error() is the newly introduce inline function
in 4.17-rc6.
