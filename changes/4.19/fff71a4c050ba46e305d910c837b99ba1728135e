ALSA: vx222: Fix invalid endian conversions

The endian conversions used in vx2_dma_read() and vx2_dma_write() are
superfluous and even wrong on big-endian machines, as inl() and outl()
already do conversions.  Kill them.

Spotted by sparse, a warning like:
  sound/pci/vx222/vx222_ops.c:278:30: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different base types)
