memory: tegra: Correct driver probe order

The Reset Controller should be registered in the end of probe, otherwise
Memory Controller device goes away if IRQ requesting fails and the Reset
Controller stays registered. To avoid having to unwind the MC probing in
a case of SMMU probe failure, let's simply print the error message without
failing the MC probe. This allows us to just move the Reset Controller
registering before the SMMU registration, reducing code churning. Also
let's not fail MC probe in a case of Reset Controller registration failure
as it doesn't prevent the MC driver to work.
