staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page 8 definitions - Style

Remove page 8 definitions which are never used in code.

Many of these definitions, if not all, fail the checkpatch CamelCase
checks. To avoid the effort of renaming unused definitions they have
been removed. This is a style change which should have no impact on
runtime execution.
