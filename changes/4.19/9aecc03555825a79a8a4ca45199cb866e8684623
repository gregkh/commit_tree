media: rockchip/rga: Fix broken .start_streaming

Currently, rga_buf_start_streaming() is expecting
pm_runtime_get_sync to return zero on success, which
is wrong.

As per the documentation, pm_runtime_get_sync increments
the device's usage counter and return its result.
This means it will typically return a positive integer
on success and a negative error code.

Therefore, rockchip-rga driver is currently unusable
failing to start_streaming in most cases. Fix it and
while here, cleanup the buffer return-to-core logic.
