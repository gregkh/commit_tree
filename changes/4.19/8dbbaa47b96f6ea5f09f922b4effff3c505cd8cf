spi: rspi: Fix interrupted DMA transfers

When interrupted, wait_event_interruptible_timeout() returns
-ERESTARTSYS, and the SPI transfer in progress will fail, as expected:

    m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -512
    spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue

However, as the underlying DMA transfers may not have completed, all
subsequent SPI transfers may start to fail:

    spi_master spi0: receive timeout
    qspi_transfer_out_in() returned -110
    m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -110
    spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue

Fix this by calling dmaengine_terminate_all() not only for timeouts, but
also for errors.

This can be reproduced on r8a7991/koelsch, using "hd /dev/mtd0" followed
by CTRL-C.
