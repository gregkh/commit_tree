ARM: dts: imx23-evk: Convert to the new display bindings

imx23-evk board has a Seiko 43WVF1G parallel display.

Instead of hardcoding the display timings in the device tree, use
the "sii,43wvf1g" compatible instead.

This aligns with the new mxsfb bindings scheme documented at:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/mxsfb.txt
