smb3: display stats counters for number of slow commands

When CONFIG_CIFS_STATS2 is enabled keep counters for slow
commands (ie server took longer than 1 second to respond)
by SMB2/SMB3 command code.  This can help in diagnosing
whether performance problems are on server (instead of
client) and which commands are causing the problem.

Sample output (the new lines contain words "slow responses ...")

$ cat /proc/fs/cifs/Stats
