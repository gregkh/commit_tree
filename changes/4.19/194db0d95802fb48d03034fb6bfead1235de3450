selftests/bpf: Test for get_socket_cookie

Add test to use get_socket_cookie() from BPF programs of types
BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS and BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR.

The test attaches two programs to cgroup, runs TCP server and client in
the cgroup and checks that two operations are done properly on client
socket when user calls connect(2):

1. In BPF_CGROUP_INET6_CONNECT socket cookie is used as the key to write
   new value in a map for client socket.

2. In BPF_CGROUP_SOCK_OPS (BPF_SOCK_OPS_TCP_CONNECT_CB callback) the
   value written in "1." is found by socket cookie, since it's the same
   socket, and updated.

Finally the test verifies the value in the map.
