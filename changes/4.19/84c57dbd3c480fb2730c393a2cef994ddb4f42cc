arm64: kernel: arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo() should depend on CONFIG_CRASH_CORE

Since commit 23c85094fe18 ("proc/kcore: add vmcoreinfo note to /proc/kcore")
the kernel has exported the vmcoreinfo PT_NOTE on /proc/kcore as well
as /proc/vmcore.

arm64 only exposes it's additional arch information via
arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo() if built with CONFIG_KEXEC, as kdump was
previously the only user of vmcoreinfo.

Move this weak function to a separate file that is built at the same
time as its caller in kernel/crash_core.c. This ensures values like
'kimage_voffset' are always present in the vmcoreinfo PT_NOTE.
