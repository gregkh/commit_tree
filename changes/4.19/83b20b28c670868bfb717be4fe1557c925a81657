KVM: x86: don't reset root in kvm_mmu_setup()

Here is the code path which shows kvm_mmu_setup() is invoked after
kvm_mmu_create(). Since kvm_mmu_setup() is only invoked in this code path,
this means the root_hpa and prev_roots are guaranteed to be invalid. And
it is not necessary to reset it again.

    kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu()
        kvm_arch_vcpu_create()
            vmx_create_vcpu()
                kvm_vcpu_init()
                    kvm_arch_vcpu_init()
                        kvm_mmu_create()
        kvm_arch_vcpu_setup()
            kvm_mmu_setup()
                kvm_init_mmu()

This patch set reset_roots to false in kmv_mmu_setup().
