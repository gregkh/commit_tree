xfs: do not set the page uptodate in xfs_writepage_map

We already track the page uptodate status based on the buffer uptodate
status, which is updated whenever reading or zeroing blocks.

This code has been there since commit a ptool commit in 2002, which
claims to:

    "merge" the 2.4 fsx fix for block size < page size to 2.5.  This needed
    major changes to actually fit.

and isn't present in other writepage implementations.
