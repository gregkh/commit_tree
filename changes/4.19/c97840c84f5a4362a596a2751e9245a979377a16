scsi: tcmu: do not set max_blocks if data_bitmap has been setup

This patch prevents a bug where data_bitmap is allocated in
tcmu_configure_device, userspace changes the max_blocks setting, the device
is mapped to a LUN, then we try to access the data_bitmap based on the new
max_blocks limit which may now be out of range.

To prevent this, we just check if data_bitmap has been setup. If it has
then we fail the max_blocks update operation.
