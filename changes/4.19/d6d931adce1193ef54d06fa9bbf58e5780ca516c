fuse: use kvmalloc to allocate array of pipe_buffer structs.

The amount of pipe->buffers is basically controlled by userspace by
fcntl(... F_SETPIPE_SZ ...) so it could be large. High order allocations
could be slow (if memory is heavily fragmented) or may fail if the order
is larger than PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER.

Since the 'bufs' doesn't need to be physically contiguous, use
the kvmalloc_array() to allocate memory. If high order
page isn't available, the kvamalloc*() will fallback to 0-order.
