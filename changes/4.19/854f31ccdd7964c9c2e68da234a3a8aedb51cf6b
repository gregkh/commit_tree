block: fix deadline elevator drain for zoned block devices

When the deadline scheduler is used with a zoned block device, writes
to a zone will be dispatched one at a time. This causes the warning
message:

deadline: forced dispatching is broken (nr_sorted=X), please report this

to be displayed when switching to another elevator with the legacy I/O
path while write requests to a zone are being retained in the scheduler
queue.

Prevent this message from being displayed when executing
elv_drain_elevator() for a zoned block device. __blk_drain_queue() will
loop until all writes are dispatched and completed, resulting in the
desired elevator queue drain without extensive modifications to the
deadline code itself to handle forced-dispatch calls.
