xfs: remove unused btree cursor bc_private.a.dfops field

The xfs_btree_cur.bc_private.a.dfops field is only ever initialized
by the refcountbt cursor init function. The only caller of that
function with a non-NULL dfops is from deferred completion context,
which already has attached to ->t_dfops.

In addition to that, the only actual reference of a.dfops is the
cursor duplication function, which means the field is effectively
unused.

Remove the dfops field from the bc_private.a union. Any future users
can acquire the dfops from the transaction. This patch does not
change behavior.
