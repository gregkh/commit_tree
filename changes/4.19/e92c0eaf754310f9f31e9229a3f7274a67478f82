rbd: support cloning across namespaces

If parent_get class method is not supported by the OSDs, fall back to
the legacy class method and assume that the parent is in the default
(i.e. "") namespace.  The "use the child's image namespace" workaround
is no longer needed because creating images within namespaces will
require parent_get aware OSDs.
