x86/KVM/VMX: Move the l1tf_flush_l1d test to vmx_l1d_flush()

Currently, vmx_vcpu_run() checks if l1tf_flush_l1d is set and invokes
vmx_l1d_flush() if so.

This test is unncessary for the "always flush L1D" mode.

Move the check to vmx_l1d_flush()'s conditional mode code path.

Notes:
- vmx_l1d_flush() is likely to get inlined anyway and thus, there's no
  extra function call.
  
- This inverts the (static) branch prediction, but there hadn't been any
  explicit likely()/unlikely() annotations before and so it stays as is.
