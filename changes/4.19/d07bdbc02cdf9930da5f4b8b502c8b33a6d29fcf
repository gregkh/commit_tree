i2c: designware: Add debug print for bus speed

Trivial added debug print for dev->clk_freq doesn't necessarily tell the
actual bus speed or mode the controller is operating. For instance it
may indicate 1 MHz Fast Mode Plus or 3.4 MHz High Speed but driver ends up
using 400 kHz Fast Mode due missing timing parameters or missing support
from HW.

Add a debug print that prints the bus speed based on the validated speed
that gets programmed into a HW.
