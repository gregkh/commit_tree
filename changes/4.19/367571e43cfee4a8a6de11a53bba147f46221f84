crypto: inside-secure - add multiple processing engine support

So far a single processing engine (PE) was configured and used in the
Inside Secure SafeXcel cryptographic engine driver. Some versions have
more than a single PE. This patch rework the driver's initialization to
take this into account and to allow configuring more than one PE.
