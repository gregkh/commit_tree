scsi: Check sense buffer size at build time

To avoid introducing problems like those fixed in commit f7068114d45e
("sr: pass down correctly sized SCSI sense buffer"), this creates a macro
wrapper for scsi_execute() that verifies the size of the sense buffer
similar to what was done for command string sizes in commit 3756f6401c30
("exec: avoid gcc-8 warning for get_task_comm").

Another solution could be to add a length argument to scsi_execute(),
but this function already takes a lot of arguments and Jens was not fond
of that approach.

Additionally, this moves the SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE definition into
scsi_device.h, and removes a redundant include for scsi_device.h from
scsi_cmnd.h.
