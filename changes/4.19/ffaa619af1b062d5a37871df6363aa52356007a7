printk: Fix warning about unused suppress_message_printing

suppress_message_printing() is not longer called in console_unlock().
Therefore it is not longer needed with disabled CONFIG_PRINTK.

This fixes the warning:

kernel/printk/printk.c:2033:13: warning: ‘suppress_message_printing’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
 static bool suppress_message_printing(int level) { return false; }
