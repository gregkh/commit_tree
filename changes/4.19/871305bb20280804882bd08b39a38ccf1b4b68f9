mm: /proc/pid/*maps remove is_pid and related wrappers

Patch series "cleanups and refactor of /proc/pid/smaps*".

The recent regression in /proc/pid/smaps made me look more into the code.
Especially the issues with smaps_rollup reported in [1] as explained in
Patch 4, which fixes them by refactoring the code.  Patches 2 and 3 are
preparations for that.  Patch 1 is me realizing that there's a lot of
boilerplate left from times where we tried (unsuccessfuly) to mark thread
stacks in the output.

Originally I had also plans to rework the translation from
/proc/pid/*maps* file offsets to the internal structures.  Now the offset
means "vma number", which is not really stable (vma's can come and go
between read() calls) and there's an extra caching of last vma's address.
My idea was that offsets would be interpreted directly as addresses, which
would also allow meaningful seeks (see the ugly seek_to_smaps_entry() in
tools/testing/selftests/vm/mlock2.h).  However loff_t is (signed) long
long so that might be insufficient somewhere for the unsigned long
addresses.

So the result is fixed issues with skewed /proc/pid/smaps_rollup results,
simpler smaps code, and a lot of unused code removed.

This patch (of 4):

Commit b76437579d13 ("procfs: mark thread stack correctly in
proc/<pid>/maps") introduced differences between /proc/PID/maps and
/proc/PID/task/TID/maps to mark thread stacks properly, and this was
also done for smaps and numa_maps.  However it didn't work properly and
was ultimately removed by commit b18cb64ead40 ("fs/proc: Stop trying to
report thread stacks").

Now the is_pid parameter for the related show_*() functions is unused
and we can remove it together with wrapper functions and ops structures
that differ for PID and TID cases only in this parameter.
