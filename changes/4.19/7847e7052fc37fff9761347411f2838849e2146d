RISC-V: Define sys_riscv_flush_icache when SMP=n

This would be necessary to make non-SMP builds work, but there is
another error in the implementation of our syscall linkage that actually
just causes sys_riscv_flush_icache to never build.  I've build tested
this on allnoconfig and allnoconfig+SMP=y, as well as defconfig like
normal.
