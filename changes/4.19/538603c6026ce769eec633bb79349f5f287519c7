dmaengine: sh: rcar-dmac: avoid to write CHCR.TE to 1 if TCR is set to 0

This patch fixes an issue that unexpected retransfering happens
if TCR is set to 0 before rcar_dmac_sync_tcr() writes DE bit to
the CHCR register. For example, sh-sci driver can reproduce this
issue like below:

 In rx_timer_fn():		/* CHCR DE bit may be set to 1 */
  dmaengine_tx_status()
   rcar_dmac_tx_status()
    rcar_dmac_chan_get_residue()
     rcar_dmac_sync_tcr()	/* TCR is possible to be set to 0 */

According to the description of commit 73a47bd0da66 ("dmaengine:
rcar-dmac: use TCRB instead of TCR for residue"), "this buffered data
will be transferred if CHCR::DE bit was cleared". So, this patch
doesn't need to check TCRB register.
