selftests: forwarding: lib: Extract interface-init functions

The function simple_if_init() does two things: it creates a VRF, then
moves an interface into this VRF and configures addresses. The latter
comes in handy when adding more interfaces into a VRF later on. The
situation is similar for simple_if_fini().

Therefore split the interface remastering and address de/initialization
logic to a new pair of helpers __simple_if_init() / __simple_if_fini(),
and defer to these helpers from simple_if_init() and simple_if_fini().
