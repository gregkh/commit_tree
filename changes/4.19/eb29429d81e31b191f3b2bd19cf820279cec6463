bpf, sockmap: fix sock hash count in alloc_sock_hash_elem

When we try to allocate a new sock hash entry and the allocation
fails, then sock hash map fails to reduce the map element counter,
meaning we keep accounting this element although it was never used.
Fix it by dropping the element counter on error.
