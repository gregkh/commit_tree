drivers: qcom: rpmh: fix unwanted error check for get_tcs_of_type()

The patch fixes the bug reported by Dan Carpenter.
It removes the unnecessary err check for ‘tcs’ reported by
static checker warning:

drivers/soc/qcom/rpmh-rsc.c:111 tcs_invalidate()
warn: 'tcs' isn't an ERR_PTR

an ERR_PTR
drivers/soc/qcom/rpmh-rsc.c:180 get_tcs_for_msg() warn: 'tcs' isn't
an ERR_PTR
