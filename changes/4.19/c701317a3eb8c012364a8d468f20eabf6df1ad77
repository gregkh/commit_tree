dma-fence: Make ->enable_signaling optional

Many drivers have a trivial implementation for ->enable_signaling.
Let's make it optional by assuming that signalling is already
available when the callback isn't present.

v2: Don't do the trick to set the ENABLE_SIGNAL_BIT
unconditionally, it results in an expensive spinlock take for
everyone. Instead just check if the callback is present. Suggested by
Maarten.

Also move misplaced kerneldoc hunk to the right patch.
