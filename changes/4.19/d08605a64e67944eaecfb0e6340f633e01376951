ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: move late devices back to init_machine

Initialization of several Amstrad Delta devices was once moved to
late_initcall by commit f7519d8c8290 ("ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: register
latch dependent devices later").  The purpose of that move was to allow
smooth conversion of Amstrad Delta latches to GPIO.

After successful conversion only ams_delta_serio driver was moved back
to device_initcall by commit 8d09a1bb3147 ("input: serio: ams-delta:
toggle keyboard power over GPIO").  Registration of ams-delta-nand and
lcd_ams_delta devices was kept in late_initcall in order to avoid
corrupt data reported by the serio driver on boot.  Registration of
cx20442-codec device was kept there for it to be probed after a
regulator on which it depended was ready.

The issue of "keybrd_dataout" GPIO pin not initilized to GPIO_OUT_LOW
before other latch2 pins causing the corruption have been apparently
fixed by commit 5322c19b117a ("ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Hog
"keybrd_dataout" GPIO pin").  In turn, the issue of missing regulator
has been fixed by commit 50c678772a0b ("ASoC: cx20442: Don't ignore
regulator_get() errors.").

Simplify the board init code by moving registration of those devices
back to init_machine.
