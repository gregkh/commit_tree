media: ov772x: avoid accessing registers under power saving mode

The set_fmt() in subdev pad ops, the s_ctrl() for subdev control handler,
and the s_frame_interval() in subdev video ops could be called when the
device is under power saving mode.  These callbacks for ov772x driver
cause updating H/W registers that will fail under power saving mode.

This avoids it by not apply any changes to H/W if the device is not powered
up.  Instead the changes will be restored right after power-up.
