ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: Select CONFIG_DRM_PANEL_SEIKO_43WVF1G

imx6sl-evk, imx6sll-evk and imx6sx-sdb boards use a Seiko 43WVF1G panel.

Now that the DRM mxsfb driver is the one selected by default, let's
also select CONFIG_DRM_PANEL_SEIKO_43WVF1G so that these boards continue
to have a working display by default.
