PCI: Check for PCIe Link downtraining

When both ends of a PCIe Link are capable of a higher bandwidth than is
currently in use, the Link is said to be "downtrained".  A downtrained Link
may indicate hardware or configuration problems in the system, but it's
hard to identify such Links from userspace.

Refactor pcie_print_link_status() so it continues to always print PCIe
bandwidth information, as several NIC drivers desire.

Add a new internal __pcie_print_link_status() to emit a message only when a
device's bandwidth is constrained by the fabric and call it from the PCI
core for all devices, which identifies all downtrained Links.  It also
emits messages for a few cases that are technically not downtrained, such
as a x4 device in an open-ended x1 slot.
