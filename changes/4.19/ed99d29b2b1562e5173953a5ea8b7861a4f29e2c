platform/x86: asus-wmi: Add keyboard backlight toggle support

Some ASUS laptops like UX550GE has hotkey (Fn+F7) for keyboard
backlight toggle which would emit the scan code 0xc7 each keypress.
On the UX550GE, the max keyboard brightness level is 3 so the
toggle would not be simply on/off the led but need to be cyclic.
Per ASUS spec, it should increment the brightness for each keypress,
then toggle(off) the LED when it already reached the max level.
