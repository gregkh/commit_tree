PCI: hotplug: Delete skeleton driver

Ten years ago, commit 58319b802a61 ("PCI: Hotplug core: remove 'name'")
dropped the name element from struct hotplug_slot but neglected to update
the skeleton driver.

That same year, commit f46753c5e354 ("PCI: introduce pci_slot") raised the
number of arguments to pci_hp_register() from one to four.

Fourteen years ago, historic commit 7ab60fc1b8e7 ("PCI Hotplug skeleton:
final cleanups") removed all usages of the retval variable from
pcihp_skel_init() but not the variable itself, provoking a compiler
warning: https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/7ab60fc1b8e7

It seems fair to assume the driver hasn't been used as a template for a new
driver in a while.  Per Bjorn's and Christoph's preference, delete it.
