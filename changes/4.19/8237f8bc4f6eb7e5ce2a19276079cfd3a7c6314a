irqchip: add a SiFive PLIC driver

Add a driver for the SiFive implementation of the RISC-V Platform Level
Interrupt Controller (PLIC).  The PLIC connects global interrupt sources
to the local interrupt controller on each hart.

This driver is based on the driver in the RISC-V tree from Palmer Dabbelt,
but has been almost entirely rewritten since, and includes many fixes
from Atish Patra.
