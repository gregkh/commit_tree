fsi: Don't use device_unregister() in fsi_master_register()

In the error path of fsi_master_register(), we currently
use device_unregister(). This will cause the last reference
to the structure to be dropped, thus freeing the enclosing
structure, which isn't what the callers want.

Use device_del() instead so that we return to the caller
with a refcount of 1. The caller can then assume that it
must use put_device() after a call to fsi_master_register()
regardless of whether the latter suceeded or failed.
