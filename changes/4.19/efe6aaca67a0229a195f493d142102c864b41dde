net: ipv4: fix list processing on L3 slave devices

If we have an L3 master device, l3mdev_ip_rcv() will steal the skb, but
 we were returning NET_RX_SUCCESS from ip_rcv_finish_core() which meant
 that ip_list_rcv_finish() would keep it on the list.  Instead let's
 move the l3mdev_ip_rcv() call into the caller, so that our response to
 a steal can be different in the single packet path (return
 NET_RX_SUCCESS) and the list path (forget this packet and continue).
