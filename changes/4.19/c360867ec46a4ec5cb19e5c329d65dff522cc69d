mlxsw: spectrum: Delete RIF when VLAN device is removed

In commit 602b74eda813 ("mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Do not leak RIFs
when removing bridge") I handled the case where RIFs created for VLAN
devices were not properly cleaned up when their real device (a bridge)
was removed.

However, I forgot to handle the case of the VLAN device itself being
removed. Do so now when the VLAN device is being unlinked from its real
device.
