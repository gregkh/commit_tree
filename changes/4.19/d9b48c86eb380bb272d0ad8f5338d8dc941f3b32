x86/intel_rdt: Display resource groups' allocations' size in bytes

The schemata file displays the allocations associated with each domain of
each resource. The syntax of this file reflects the capacity bitmask (CBM)
of the actual allocation. In order to determine the actual size of an
allocation the user needs to dig through three different files to query the
variables needed to compute it (the cache size, the CBM length, and the
schemata).

Introduce a new file "size" associated with each resource group that will
mirror the schemata file syntax and display the size in bytes of each
allocation.
