dt-bindings: new binding for Ilitek ILI9341 display panels

This adds a new binding for Ilitek ILI9341 display panels. It includes
a compatible string for one display (more can be added in the future).

The YX240QV29-T panel[1] is found, for example, in an Adafruit breakout
board[2] and in Mindsensors' PiStorms[3].

The vendor prefix "adafruit" is used because the actual vendor is not
known, but Adafruit is the most common source for a product that
contains this panel.
