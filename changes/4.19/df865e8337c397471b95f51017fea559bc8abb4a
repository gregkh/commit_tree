fs/proc/kcore.c: use __pa_symbol() for KCORE_TEXT list entries

elf_kcore_store_hdr() uses __pa() to find the physical address of
KCORE_RAM or KCORE_TEXT entries exported as program headers.

This trips CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL's checks, as the KCORE_TEXT entries are
not in the linear map.

Handle these two cases separately, using __pa_symbol() for the KCORE_TEXT
entries.
