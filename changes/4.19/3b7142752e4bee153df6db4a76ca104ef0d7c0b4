arm64: convert native/compat syscall entry to C

Now that the syscall invocation logic is in C, we can migrate the rest
of the syscall entry logic over, so that the entry assembly needn't look
at the register values at all.

The SVE reset across syscall logic now unconditionally clears TIF_SVE,
but sve_user_disable() will only write back to CPACR_EL1 when SVE is
actually enabled.
