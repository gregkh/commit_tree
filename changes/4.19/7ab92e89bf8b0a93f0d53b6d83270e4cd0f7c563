PCI/AER: Clear only ERR_FATAL status bits during fatal recovery

During recovery from fatal errors, we previously called
pci_cleanup_aer_uncorrect_error_status(), which cleared *all* uncorrectable
error status bits (both ERR_FATAL and ERR_NONFATAL).

Instead, call a new pci_aer_clear_fatal_status() that clears only the
ERR_FATAL bits (as indicated by the PCI_ERR_UNCOR_SEVER register).
