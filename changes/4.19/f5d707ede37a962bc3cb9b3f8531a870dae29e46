ACPI: fix menuconfig presentation of ACPI submenu

My fix for a recursive Kconfig dependency caused another issue where the
ACPI specific options end up in the top-level menu in 'menuconfig'. This
was an unintended side-effect of having a silent option between
'menuconfig ACPI' and 'if ACPI'.

Moving the ARCH_SUPPORTS_ACPI symbol ahead of the ACPI menu solves that
problem and restores the previous presentation.
