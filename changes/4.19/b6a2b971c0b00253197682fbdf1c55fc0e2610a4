net: sched: act_csum: remove dependency on rtnl lock

Use tcf lock to protect csum action struct private data from concurrent
modification in init and dump. Use rcu swap operation to reassign params
pointer under protection of tcf lock. (old params value is not used by
init, so there is no need of standalone rcu dereference step)

Remove rtnl assertion that is no longer necessary.
