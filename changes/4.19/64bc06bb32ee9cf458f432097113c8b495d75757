gfs2: iomap buffered write support

With the traditional page-based writes, blocks are allocated separately
for each page written to.  With iomap writes, we can allocate a lot more
blocks at once, with a fraction of the allocation overhead for each
page.

Split calculating the number of blocks that can be allocated at a given
position (gfs2_alloc_size) off from gfs2_iomap_alloc: that size
determines the number of blocks to allocate and reserve in the journal.
