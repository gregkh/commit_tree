perf auxtrace: Support for perf report -D for s390

Add initial support for s390 auxiliary traces using the CPU-Measurement
Sampling Facility.

Support and ignore PERF_REPORT_AUXTRACE_INFO records in the perf data
file. Later patches will show the contents of the auxiliary traces.

Setup the auxtrace queues and data structures for s390.  A raw dump of
the perf.data file now does not show an error when an auxtrace event is
encountered.

Output before:

  [root@s35lp76 perf]# ./perf report -D -i perf.data.auxtrace
  0x128 [0x10]: failed to process type: 70
  Error:
  failed to process sample

  0x128 [0x10]: PERF_RECORD_AUXTRACE_INFO type: 0
  [root@s35lp76 perf]#

Output after:

implementation, provided by Hendrik Brueckner (see Link: below).

=============================================================================

The CPU-Measurement Facility (CPU-MF) provides a set of functions to obtain
performance information on the mainframe.  Basically, it was introduced
with System z10 years ago for the z/Architecture, that means, 64-bit.
For Linux, there are two facilities of interest, counter facility and sampling
facility.  The counter facility provides hardware counters for instructions,
cycles, crypto-activities, and many more.

The sampling facility is a hardware sampler that when started will write
samples at a particular interval into a sampling buffer.  At some point,
for example, if a sample block is full, it generates an interrupt to collect
samples (while the sampler continues to run).

Few years ago, I started to provide the a perf PMU to use the counter
and sampling facilities.  Recently, the device driver was updated to also
"export" the sampling buffer into the AUX area.  Thomas now completed the
related perf work to interpret and process these AUX data.

If people are more interested in the sampling facility, they can have a
look into:

and to learn how-to use it for Linux on Z, have look at chapter 54,
