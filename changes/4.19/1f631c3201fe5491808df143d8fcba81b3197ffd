mac80211: mesh: fix HWMP sequence numbering to follow standard

IEEE 802.11-2016 14.10.8.3 HWMP sequence numbering says:
If it is a target mesh STA, it shall update its own HWMP SN to
maximum (current HWMP SN, target HWMP SN in the PREQ element) + 1
immediately before it generates a PREP element in response to a
PREQ element.
