qlge: Fix netdev features configuration.

qlge_fix_features() is not supposed to modify hardware or
driver state, rather it is supposed to only fix requested
fetures bits. Currently qlge_fix_features() also goes for
interface down and up unnecessarily if there is not even
any change in features set.

This patch changes/fixes following -

1) Move reload of interface or device re-config from
   qlge_fix_features() to qlge_set_features().
2) Reload of interface in qlge_set_features() only if
   relevant feature bit (NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_RX) is changed.
3) Get rid of qlge_fix_features() since driver is not really
   required to fix any features bit.
