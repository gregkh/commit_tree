media: imx274: simplify imx274_write_table()

imx274_write_table() is a mere wrapper (and the only user) to
imx274_regmap_util_write_table_8(). Remove this useless indirection by
merging the two functions into one.

Also get rid of the wait_ms_addr and end_addr parameters since it does
not make any sense to give them any values other than
IMX274_TABLE_WAIT_MS and IMX274_TABLE_END.
