ALSA: hda/realtek - Apply PRE_PROBE fixup after ALC269 codec variant setups

Currently patch_alc269() calls the fixup with HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE
before setting up the codec model-specific setups (e.g. setting
codec_variant or mixer_nid setup).  This is rather confusing as others
do call the *_PRE_PROBE fixup after such a setup.  Due to this
disorder, we have to override spec->shutup not at the usual
HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE but the unusual HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PROBE time.

This patch corrects the fixup call orders in patch_alc269(), and also
corrects the action to set up spec->shutup accordingly.

No functional changes but just refactoring.
