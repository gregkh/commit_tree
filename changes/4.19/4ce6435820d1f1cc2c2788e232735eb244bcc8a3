PCI: hotplug: Don't leak pci_slot on registration failure

If addition of sysfs files fails on registration of a hotplug slot, the
struct pci_slot as well as the entry in the slot_list is leaked.  The
issue has been present since the hotplug core was introduced in 2002:
https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/a8a2069f432c

Perhaps the idea was that even though sysfs addition fails, the slot
should still be usable.  But that's not how drivers use the interface,
they abort probe if a non-zero value is returned.
