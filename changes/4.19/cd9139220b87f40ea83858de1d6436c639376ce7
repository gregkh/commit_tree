xen: don't use privcmd_call() from xen_mc_flush()

Using privcmd_call() for a singleton multicall seems to be wrong, as
privcmd_call() is using stac()/clac() to enable hypervisor access to
Linux user space.

Even if currently not a problem (pv domains can't use SMAP while HVM
and PVH domains can't use multicalls) things might change when
PVH dom0 support is added to the kernel.
