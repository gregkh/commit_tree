ALSA: usb-audio: Unify virtual type units type to UAC3 values

The Audio Control interface descriptor subtypes do not match
across all the UAC versions. That makes reusability of the
"virtual type" (Mixer, Processors, Selectors, etc) terminals
difficult. It also makes the mixer get the default names for
the virtual terminals wrong due to the overlap.

This patch proposes an unified approach by always using the most
comprehensive spec version to define them all (in this case UAC3).
