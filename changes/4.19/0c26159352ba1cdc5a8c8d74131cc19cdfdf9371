nfp: bpf: xdp_adjust_tail support

Add support for adjust_tail.  There are no FW changes needed but add
a FW capability just in case there would be any issue with previously
released FW, or we will have to change the ABI in the future.

The helper is trivial and shouldn't be used too often so just inline
the body of the function.  We add the delta to locally maintained
packet length register and check for overflow, since add of negative
value must overflow if result is positive.  Note that if delta of 0
would be allowed in the kernel this trick stops working and we need
one more instruction to compare lengths before and after the change.
