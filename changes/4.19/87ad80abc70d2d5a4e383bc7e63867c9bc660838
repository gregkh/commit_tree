IB/uverbs: Consolidate uobject destruction

There are several flows that can destroy a uobject and each one is
minimized and sprinkled throughout the code base, making it difficult to
understand and very hard to modify the destroy path.

Consolidate all of these into uverbs_destroy_uobject() and call it in all
cases where a uobject has to be destroyed.

This makes one change to the lifecycle, during any abort (eg when
alloc_commit is not called) we always call out to alloc_abort, even if
remove_commit needs to be called to delete a HW object.

This also renames RDMA_REMOVE_DURING_CLEANUP to RDMA_REMOVE_ABORT to
clarify its actual usage and revises some of the comments to reflect what
the life cycle is for the type implementation.
