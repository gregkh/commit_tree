perf util: Fix bad memory access in trace info.

In the write to the output_fd in the error condition of
record_saved_cmdline(), we are writing 8 bytes from a memory location on
the stack that contains a primitive that is only 4 bytes in size.
Change the primitive to 8 bytes in size to match the size of the write
in order to avoid reading unknown memory from the stack.
