sched/irq: Add IRQ utilization tracking

interrupt and steal time are the only remaining activities tracked by
rt_avg. Like for sched classes, we can use PELT to track their average
utilization of the CPU. But unlike sched class, we don't track when
entering/leaving interrupt; Instead, we take into account the time spent
under interrupt context when we update rqs' clock (rq_clock_task).
This also means that we have to decay the normal context time and account
for interrupt time during the update.

That's also important to note that because:

  rq_clock == rq_clock_task + interrupt time

and rq_clock_task is used by a sched class to compute its utilization, the
util_avg of a sched class only reflects the utilization of the time spent
in normal context and not of the whole time of the CPU. The utilization of
interrupt gives an more accurate level of utilization of CPU.

The CPU utilization is:

  avg_irq + (1 - avg_irq / max capacity) * /Sum avg_rq

Most of the time, avg_irq is small and neglictible so the use of the
approximation CPU utilization = /Sum avg_rq was enough.
