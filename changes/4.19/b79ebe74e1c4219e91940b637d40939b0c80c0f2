drm/i915/ddi: Simplify get_encoder_power_domains()

We can simplify the encoder's get_power_domains() hook by calling it
only if the encoder is active. That way the hook can return its power
domains unconditionally without checking the active state by calling
encoder::get_hw_state(). This get_hw_state() query is in fact
redundant since it's already done by intel_modeset_readout_hw_state()
setting the encoder's crtc or leaving it NULL accordingly. Let's use
this fact to decide if the encoder is active.

While at it clarify the comment in intel_ddi_get_power_domains() about
primary vs. fake MST encoders and make sure we never do an incorrect
encoder->dig_port cast for fake MST encoders.
