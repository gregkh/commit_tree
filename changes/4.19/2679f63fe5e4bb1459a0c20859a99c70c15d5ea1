selftests/powerpc/64: Test exception cases in copy_tofrom_user

This adds a set of test cases to test the behaviour of
copy_tofrom_user when exceptions are encountered accessing the
source or destination.  Currently, copy_tofrom_user does not always
copy as many bytes as possible when an exception occurs on a store
to the destination, and that is reflected in failures in these tests.

Based on a test program from Anton Blanchard.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - test all three paths, wrote commit description,
