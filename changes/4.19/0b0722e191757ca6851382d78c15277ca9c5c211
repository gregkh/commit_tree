ASoC: compress: make BE and FE order inline with dpcm

For some reason order of startup/hw_params/prepare are reversed
in dynamic compress usecase when compared to dpcm usecase. This is
a issue with platforms like QCOM where it expects the BE to be
initialized before FE.

Interestingly the compress trigger callback order is inline with dpcm.

Am not 100% sure why the compress audio case has been reversed.
This patch is making the order inline with dpcm.

If the reverse ordering is just co-incendental then this change
makes sense and will avoid inventing some new mechanism to cope
with ordering.
