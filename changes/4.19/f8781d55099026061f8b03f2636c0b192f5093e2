usb: dwc2: Turn on uframe_sched on "stm32f4x9_fsotg" platforms

There's no reason to have the uframe scheduler off on dwc2.  Running
with uframe_sched = False is equivalent to saying "I don't want to run
the correct code, I want to run the old and incorrect code".

The uframe scheduler has been off on stm32f4x9_fsotg since commit
e35b135055e2 ("usb: dwc2: Add support for STM32F429/439/469 USB OTG
HS/FS in FS mode (internal PHY)").  That commit is pretty recent, so
it's unclear to me why the uframe scheduler was left off.  Hopefully
it's because someone copied it from other parameters and didn't think
to try it?

Presumably if everyone is good w/ the uframe_sched turned back on we
can kill all the old and crufty non-uframe sched code.
