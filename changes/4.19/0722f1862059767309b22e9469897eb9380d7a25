fs/afs: use new return type vm_fault_t

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler in struct
vm_operations_struct.  For now, this is just documenting that the
function returns a VM_FAULT value rather than an errno.  Once all
instances are converted, vm_fault_t will become a distinct type.

See 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t") for reference.
