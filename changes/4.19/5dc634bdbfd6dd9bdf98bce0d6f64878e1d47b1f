drm: Add puts callback for the coredump printer

Add a puts function for the coredump printer to bypass printf()
for constant strings for a speed boost. Reorganize the
coredump printf callback to share as much code as possible.

v2: Try to reuse code between print and puts as suggested by
    Chris Wilson
