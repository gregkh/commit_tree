drm/msm/adreno: Add power management functions for system sleep

When a msm8016 based system is woken up from suspend, the firmware in
the adreno device hangs.

[   83.903416] qcom-iommu-ctx 1f09000.iommu-ctx: Unhandled context fault: fsr=0x202, iova=0x0000000000000000, fsynr=0x2, cb=1

Fix this by adding pm_runtime_force_suspend/pm_runtime_force_resume
as sleep ops.
