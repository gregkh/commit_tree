drm/i915/selftests: Destroy partial tiling vma after use

As we keep VMA around until the object is destroyed, when testing
partial tiling we instantiate many, many VMA (as the object is huge
allowing for many different partial regions). We test elsewhere our
handling of populating large objects with a full set of VMA and checking
we can retrieve them afterwards, but in this test we incur the cost of
flushing all VMA after every GTT write, dramatically slowing down the
test.
