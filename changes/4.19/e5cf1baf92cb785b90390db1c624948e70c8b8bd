act_mirred: use TC_ACT_REINSERT when possible

When mirred is invoked from the ingress path, and it wants to redirect
the processed packet, it can now use the TC_ACT_REINSERT action,
filling the tcf_result accordingly, and avoiding a per packet
skb_clone().

Overall this gives a ~10% improvement in forwarding performance for the
TC S/W data path and TC S/W performances are now comparable to the
kernel openvswitch datapath.

v1 -> v2: use ACT_MIRRED instead of ACT_REDIRECT
v2 -> v3: updated after action rename, fixed typo into the commit
	message
v3 -> v4: updated again after action rename, added more comments to
	the code (JiriP), skip the optimization if the control action
	need to touch the tcf_result (Paolo)
v4 -> v5: fix sparse warning (kbuild bot)
