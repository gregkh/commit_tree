media: arch: sh: ms7724se: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver

Use the new renesas-ceu camera driver is ms7724se board file instead of
the soc_camera based sh_mobile_ceu_camera driver.

Get rid of soc_camera specific components, and register CEU0 and CEU1 with
no active video subdevices.

Memory for the CEU video buffers is now reserved with membocks APIs
and need to be declared as dma_coherent during machine initialization to
remove that architecture specific part from CEU driver.

While at there update license to SPDX header and sort headers
alphabetically.

No need to udapte the clock source names, as
commit c2f9b05fd5c1 ("media: arch: sh: ecovec: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver")
already updated it to the new ceu driver name for all SH7724 boards
(possibly breaking ms7724se before this commit).

Compile tested only.
