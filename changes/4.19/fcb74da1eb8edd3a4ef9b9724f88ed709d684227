drm: udl: Destroy framebuffer only if it was initialized

This fixes a NULL pointer dereference that can happen if the UDL
driver is unloaded before the framebuffer is initialized. This can
happen e.g. if the USB device is unplugged right after it was plugged
in.

As explained by StÃ©phane Marchesin:

It happens when fbdev is disabled (which is the case for Chrome OS).
Even though intialization of the fbdev part is optional (it's done in
udlfb_create which is the callback for fb_probe()), the teardown isn't
optional (udl_driver_unload -> udl_fbdev_cleanup ->
udl_fbdev_destroy).

Note that udl_fbdev_cleanup *tries* to be conditional (you can see it
does if (!udl->fbdev)) but that doesn't work, because udl->fbdev is
always set during udl_fbdev_init.
