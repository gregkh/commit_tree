dax: remove VM_MIXEDMAP for fsdax and device dax

This patch is reworked from an earlier patch that Dan has posted:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10131727/

VM_MIXEDMAP is used by dax to direct mm paths like vm_normal_page() that
the memory page it is dealing with is not typical memory from the linear
map.  The get_user_pages_fast() path, since it does not resolve the vma,
is already using {pte,pmd}_devmap() as a stand-in for VM_MIXEDMAP, so we
use that as a VM_MIXEDMAP replacement in some locations.  In the cases
where there is no pte to consult we fallback to using vma_is_dax() to
detect the VM_MIXEDMAP special case.

Now that we have explicit driver pfn_t-flag opt-in/opt-out for
get_user_pages() support for DAX we can stop setting VM_MIXEDMAP.  This
also means we no longer need to worry about safely manipulating vm_flags
in a future where we support dynamically changing the dax mode of a
file.

DAX should also now be supported with madvise_behavior(), vma_merge(),
and copy_page_range().

This patch has been tested against ndctl unit test.  It has also been
tested against xfstests commit: 625515d using fake pmem created by
memmap and no additional issues have been observed.
