nfp: move repr handling on RX path

Representor packets are received on PF queues with special metadata tag
for demux.  There is no reason to resolve the representor ID -> netdev
after the skb has been allocated.  Move the code, this will allow us to
handle special FW messages without SKB allocation overhead.
