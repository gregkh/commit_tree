IB/mad: Use IDR for agent IDs

Allocate agent IDs from a global IDR instead of an atomic variable.
This eliminates the possibility of reusing an ID which is already in
use after 4 billion registrations.  We limit the assigned ID to be less
than 2^24 as the mlx4 driver uses the most significant byte of the agent
ID to store the slave number.  Users unlucky enough to see a collision
between agent numbers and slave numbers see messages like:

 mlx4_ib: egress mad has non-null tid msb:1 class:4 slave:0

and the MAD layer stops working.

We look up the agent under protection of the RCU lock, which means we
have to free the agent using kfree_rcu, and only increment the reference
counter if it is not 0.
