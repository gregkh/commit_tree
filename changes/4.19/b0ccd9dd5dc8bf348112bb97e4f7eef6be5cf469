PCI: pciehp: Stop blinking on slot enable failure

If the attention button is pressed to power on the slot AND the user
powers on the slot via sysfs before 5 seconds have elapsed AND powering
on the slot fails because either the slot is unoccupied OR the latch is
open, we neglect turning off the green LED so it keeps on blinking.

That's because the error path of pciehp_sysfs_enable_slot() doesn't call
pciehp_green_led_off(), unlike pciehp_power_thread() which does.
The bug has been present since 2004 when the driver was introduced.

Fix by deduplicating common code in pciehp_sysfs_enable_slot() and
pciehp_power_thread() into a wrapper function pciehp_enable_slot() and
renaming the existing function to __pciehp_enable_slot().  Same for
pciehp_disable_slot().  This will also simplify the upcoming rework of
pciehp's event handling.
