KVM: vmx: rename __vmx_load_host_state() and vmx_save_host_state()

Now that the vmx_load_host_state() wrapper is gone, i.e. the only
time we call the core functions is when we're actually about to
switch between guest/host, rename the functions that handle lazy
state switching to vmx_prepare_switch_to_{guest,host}_state() to
better document the full extent of their functionality.
