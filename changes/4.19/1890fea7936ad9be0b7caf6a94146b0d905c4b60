rxrpc: Fix a missing rxrpc_put_peer() in the error_report handler

Fix a missing call to rxrpc_put_peer() on the main path through the
rxrpc_error_report() function.  This manifests itself as a ref leak
whenever an ICMP packet or other error comes in.

In commit f334430316e7, the hand-off of the ref to a work item was removed
and was not replaced with a put.
