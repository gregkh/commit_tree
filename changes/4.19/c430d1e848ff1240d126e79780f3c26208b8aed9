userfaultfd: use fault_wqh lock

The userfaultfd code currently uses the unlocked waitqueue helpers for
managing fault_wqh, but instead of holding the waitqueue lock for this
waitqueue around these calls, it the waitqueue lock of
fault_pending_wq, which is a different waitqueue instance.  Given that
the waitqueue is not exposed to the rest of the kernel this actually
works ok at the moment, but prevents the userfaultfd locking rules from
being enforced using lockdep.

Switch to the internally locked waitqueue helpers instead.  This means
that the lock inside fault_wqh now nests inside the fault_pending_wqh
lock, but that's not a problem since it was entirely unused before.
