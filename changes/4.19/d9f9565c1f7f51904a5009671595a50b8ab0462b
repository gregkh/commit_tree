drm/panel: otm8009a: Fix backlight updates

Backlight updates was not working anymore since the good implementation
of the DSI low-power mode in the DSI host driver. After a longer
analysis, the backlight updates in DSI video mode require the DSI high-
speed mode.

Note: it is important to keep the DSI low-power mode for the rest of the
driver as init sequence, sleep in/out... DSI commands work in low-power
mode.
