sysfs: Fix internal_create_group() for named group updates

There are a couple of problems with named group updates in the code
today:

* sysfs_update_group() will always fail for a named group, because
  internal_create_group() will try to create a new sysfs directory
  unconditionally, which will ofcourse fail with -EEXIST.

* We can leak the kernfs_node for grp->name if some one tries to:
  - rename a group (change grp->name), or
  - update a named group, to an unnamed group

It appears that the whole purpose of sysfs_update_group() was to
allow changing the permissions or visibility of attributes and not
the names. So make it clear in the comments, and allow it to update
an existing named group.
