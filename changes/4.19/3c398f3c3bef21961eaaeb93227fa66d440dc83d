mmc: omap_hsmmc: fix wakeirq handling on removal

after unbinding mmc I get things like this:
[  185.294067] mmc1: card 0001 removed
[  185.305206] omap_hsmmc 480b4000.mmc: wake IRQ with no resume: -13

The wakeirq stays in /proc-interrupts

rebinding shows this:
[  289.795959] genirq: Flags mismatch irq 112. 0000200a (480b4000.mmc:wakeup) vs. 0000200a (480b4000.mmc:wakeup)
[  289.808959] omap_hsmmc 480b4000.mmc: Unable to request wake IRQ
[  289.815338] omap_hsmmc 480b4000.mmc: no SDIO IRQ support, falling back to polling

That bug seems to be introduced by switching from devm_request_irq()
to generic wakeirq handling.

So let us cleanup at removal.
