ALSA: lola: Proper endian notations

The BDL entries in lola driver are little-endian while we code them as
u32.  This leads to sparse warnings like:
  sound/pci/lola/lola.c:105:40: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
  sound/pci/lola/lola.c:105:40:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] <noident>
  sound/pci/lola/lola.c:105:40:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>

This patch fixes the declarations to the proper __le32 type.

Also, there was a typo in the original code, where __user was used
that was intended as __iomem.  This was caused also by sparse:
  sound/pci/lola/lola_mixer.c:132:27: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
Fixed in this patch as well.
