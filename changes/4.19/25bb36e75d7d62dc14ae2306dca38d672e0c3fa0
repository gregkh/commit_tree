IB/mlx5: Expose dump and fill memory key

MLX5 IB HCA offers the memory key, dump_fill_mkey to boost
performance, when used in a send or receive operations.

It is used to force local HCA operations to skip the PCI bus access,
while keeping track of the processed length in the ibv_sge handling.

Meaning, instead of a PCI write access the HCA leaves the target
memory untouched, and skips filling that packet section. Similar
behavior is done upon send, the HCA skips data in memory relevant
to this key and saves PCI bus access.

This functionality saves PCI read/write operations.
