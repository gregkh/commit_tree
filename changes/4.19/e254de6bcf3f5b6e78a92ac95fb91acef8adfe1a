md/raid5-cache: disable reshape completely

We don't support reshape yet if an array supports log device. Previously we
determine the fact by checking ->log. However, ->log could be NULL after a log
device is removed, but the array is still marked to support log device. Don't
allow reshape in this case too. User can disable log device support by setting
'consistency_policy' to 'resync' then do reshape.
