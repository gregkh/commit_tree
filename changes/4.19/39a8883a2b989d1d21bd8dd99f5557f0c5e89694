random: add a config option to trust the CPU's hwrng

This gives the user building their own kernel (or a Linux
distribution) the option of deciding whether or not to trust the CPU's
hardware random number generator (e.g., RDRAND for x86 CPU's) as being
correctly implemented and not having a back door introduced (perhaps
courtesy of a Nation State's law enforcement or intelligence
agencies).

This will prevent getrandom(2) from blocking, if there is a
willingness to trust the CPU manufacturer.
