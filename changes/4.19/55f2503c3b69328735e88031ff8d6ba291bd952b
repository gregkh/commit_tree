PM / reboot: Eliminate race between reboot and suspend

At present, "systemctl suspend" and "shutdown" can run in parrallel. A
system can suspend after devices_shutdown(), and resume. Then the shutdown
task goes on to power off. This causes many devices are not really shut
off. Hence replacing reboot_mutex with system_transition_mutex (renamed
from pm_mutex) to achieve the exclusion. The renaming of pm_mutex as
system_transition_mutex can be better to reflect the purpose of the mutex.
