serial: sh-sci: Add support for R7S9210

Add support for a "RZ_SCIFA" which is different than a traditional
SCIFA. It looks like a normal SCIF with FIFO data, but with a
compressed address space. Also, the break out of interrupts
are different then traditinal SCIF: ERI/BRI, RXI, TXI, TEI, DRI.
The R7S9210 (RZ/A2) contains this type of SCIF.
