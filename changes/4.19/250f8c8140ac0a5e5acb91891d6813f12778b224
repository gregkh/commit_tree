drm/i915/gtt: Read-only pages for insert_entries on bdw+

Hook up the flags to allow read-only ppGTT mappings for gen8+

v2: Include a selftest to check that writes to a readonly PTE are
dropped
v3: Don't duplicate cpu_check() as we can just reuse it, and even worse
don't wholesale copy the theory-of-operation comment from igt_ctx_exec
without changing it to explain the intention behind the new test!
v4: Joonas really likes magic mystery values
