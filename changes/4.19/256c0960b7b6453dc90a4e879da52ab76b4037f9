kvm/arm: use PSR_AA32 definitions

Some code cares about the SPSR_ELx format for exceptions taken from
AArch32 to inspect or manipulate the SPSR_ELx value, which is already in
the SPSR_ELx format, and not in the AArch32 PSR format.

To separate these from cases where we care about the AArch32 PSR format,
migrate these cases to use the PSR_AA32_* definitions rather than
COMPAT_PSR_*.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.

Note that arm64 KVM does not support a compat KVM API, and always uses
the SPSR_ELx format, even for AArch32 guests.
