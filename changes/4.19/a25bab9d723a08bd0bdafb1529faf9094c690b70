batman-adv: Fix segfault when writing to sysfs elp_interval

The per hardif sysfs file "batman_adv/elp_interval" is using the generic
functions to store/show uint values. The helper __batadv_store_uint_attr
requires the softif net_device as parameter to print the resulting change
as info text when the users writes to this file. It uses the helper
function batadv_info to add it at the same time to the kernel ring buffer
and to the batman-adv debug log (when CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG is enabled).

The function batadv_info requires as first parameter the batman-adv softif
net_device. This parameter is then used to find the private buffer which
contains the debug log for this batman-adv interface. But
batadv_store_throughput_override used as first argument the slave
net_device. This slave device doesn't have the batadv_priv private data
which is access by batadv_info.

Writing to this file with CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG enabled can either lead
to a segfault or to memory corruption.
