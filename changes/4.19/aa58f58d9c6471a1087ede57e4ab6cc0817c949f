drm/i915/guc: Remove USES_GUC_SUBMISSION for ads programming

In the guc_ctl_debug_flags, the ads struct is programmed only
when USES_GUC_SUBMISSION is satisfied. But, this has to be
programmed for all suspend/resume cases.
Remove the condition and program the ads struct for
both huc loading and guc submission.

This issue was noticed when CI threw errors for enable_guc=2
(load huc; disable submission)

v2:
- Change commit title.
- Correct the shifts. (Daniele)
