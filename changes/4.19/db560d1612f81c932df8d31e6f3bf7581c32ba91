selftests: forwarding: mirror_lib: Tighten up VLAN capture

The function do_test_span_vlan_dir_ips() is used for testing whether
mirrored packets are VLAN-encapsulated. But since it only considers
VLAN encapsulation, it may end up matching unmirrored ARP traffic as
well. One consequence is a rare failure of mirror_gre_vlan_bridge_1q's
test_gretap_untagged_egress. Decreasing ping cadence in mirror_test()
makes the problem easily reproducible.

Therefore tighten up the match criterion to only count those 802.1q
packets where the next header is IP.
