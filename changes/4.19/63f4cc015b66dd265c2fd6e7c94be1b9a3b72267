drm: Add drm_puts() to complement drm_printf()

Add drm_puts() for a much faster path to print constant strings
into a drm_printer object with memcpy and friends. This can
have seconds off of really large outputs such as GPU dumps.

If the drm_printer object supports a custom puts function then
use that otherwise fall back to the slower legacy printf call.

v2: Add documentation for drm_puts() per Daniel Vetter
