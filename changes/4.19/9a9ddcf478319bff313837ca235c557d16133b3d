kconfig: suppress "configuration written to .config" for syncconfig

The top-level Makefile invokes "make syncconfig" when necessary.
Then, Kconfig displays the following message when .config is updated.

  #
  # configuration written to .config
  #

It is distracting because "make syncconfig" happens during the build
stage, and does nothing important in most cases.
