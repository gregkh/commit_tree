iio: adc: xilinx: limit pcap clock frequency value

This patch limits the xadc pcap clock frequency value to be less than
200MHz. This fixes the issue when zynq is booted at higher frequency
values, pcap crosses the maximum limit of 200MHz(Fmax) as it is derived
from IOPLL.
If this limit is crossed it is required to alter the WEDGE and REDGE
bits of XADC_CFG register to make timings better in the interface. So to
avoid alteration of these bits every time, the pcap value should not
cross the Fmax limit.
