scsi: tcmu: use match_int for dev params

Instead of doing strdup and kstrto* just use match_int for dev params.

It will be ok to use int instead of unsigned long in tcmu_set_dev_attrib
because that is only being used for max sectors and block size and the
supported values for them are well under the max possible integer value.
