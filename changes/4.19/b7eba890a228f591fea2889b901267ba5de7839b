gfs2: Eliminate redundant ip->i_rgd

GFS2 remembers the last rgrp used for allocations in ip->i_rgd.
However, block allocations are made by way of a reservations structure,
ip->i_res, which keeps the last rgrp in ip->i_res.rs_rgd, and ip->i_res
is kept in sync with ip->i_res.rs_rgd, so it's redundant.  Get rid of
ip->i_rgd and just use ip->i_res.rs_rgd in its place.

Based on patches by Robert Peterson.
