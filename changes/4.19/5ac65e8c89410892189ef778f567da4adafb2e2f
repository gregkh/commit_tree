ACPI/IORT: Support address size limit for root complexes

IORT revision D allows PCI root complex nodes to specify a memory
address size limit equivalently to named components, to help describe
straightforward integrations which don't really warrant a full-blown
_DMA method. Now that our headers are up-to-date, plumb it in.

If both _DMA and an address size limit are present, we would always
expect the former to be a more specific subset of the latter (since it
makes little sense for a _DMA range to involve bits which IORT says
aren't wired up), thus we can save calculating an explicit intersection
of the two effective masks and simply use short-circuit logic instead.
