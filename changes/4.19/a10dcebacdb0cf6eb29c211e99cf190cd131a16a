fs/ntfs/aops.c: don't disable interrupts during kmap_atomic()

ntfs_end_buffer_async_read() disables interrupts around kmap_atomic().
This is a leftover from the old kmap_atomic() implementation which
relied on fixed mapping slots, so the caller had to make sure that the
same slot could not be reused from an interrupting context.

kmap_atomic() was changed to dynamic slots long ago and commit
1ec9c5ddc17a ("include/linux/highmem.h: remove the second argument of
k[un]map_atomic()") removed the slot assignements, but the callers were
not checked for now redundant interrupt disabling.

Remove the conditional interrupt disable.
