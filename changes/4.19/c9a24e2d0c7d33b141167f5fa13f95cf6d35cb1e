rcu: Make quiescent-state reporting use ->gp_seq

This commit switches the functions reporting quiescent states from
use of ->gpnum to ->gp_seq.  In either case, the point is to handle
races where a given grace period ends before a quiescent state can
be reported.  Failing to catch these races would result in too-short
grace periods, hence the checking.
