ALSA: hda/via - Use standard verb containers

In this patch, the remaining static init verbs in VIA codec driver are
converted to the standard snd_hda_add_verbs() calls.  The conversion
is straightforward, but one change to be noted is the place of calls:
since these verbs are supposed to be executed at the beginning of the
init / resume procedure, we need to add snd_hda_add_verbs() calls
before calling the other parsers.

This is merely a cleanup, no functional changes.
