iommu: Remove IOMMU_OF_DECLARE

Now that we use the driver core to stop deferred probe for missing
drivers, IOMMU_OF_DECLARE can be removed.

This is slightly less optimal than having a list of built-in drivers in
that we'll now defer probe twice before giving up. This shouldn't have a
significant impact on boot times as past discussions about deferred
probe have given no evidence of deferred probe having a substantial
impact.
