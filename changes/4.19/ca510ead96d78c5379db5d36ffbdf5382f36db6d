drm/i2c: tda998x: Remove VLA usage

There's an ongoing effort to remove VLAs[1] from the kernel to eventually
turn on -Wvla. The vla in reg_write_range is based on the length of data
passed. The one use of a non-constant size for this range is bounded by
the size buffer passed to hdmi_infoframe_pack which is a fixed size.
Switch to this upper bound.
