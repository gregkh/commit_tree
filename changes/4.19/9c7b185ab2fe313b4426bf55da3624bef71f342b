powernv/cpuidle: Parse dt idle properties into global structure

Device-tree parsing happens twice, once while deciding idle state to be
used for hotplug and once during cpuidle init. Hence, parsing the device
tree and caching it will reduce code duplication. Parsing code has been
moved to pnv_parse_cpuidle_dt() from pnv_probe_idle_states(). In addition
to the properties in the device tree the number of available states is
also required.
