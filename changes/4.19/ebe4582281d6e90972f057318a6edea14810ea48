intel_th: Fix resource handling for ACPI glue layer

The core of the driver expects the resource array from the glue layer
to be indexed by even numbers, as is the case for 64-bit PCI resources.
This doesn't hold true for others, ACPI in this instance, which leads
to an out-of-bounds access and an ioremap() on whatever address that
access fetches.

This patch fixes the problem by reading resource array differently based
on whether the 64-bit flag is set, which would indicate PCI glue layer.
