r8169: don't use MSI-X on RTL8106e

Found the ethernet network on ASUS X441UAR doesn't come back on resume
from suspend when using MSI-X.  The chip is RTL8106e - version 39.

Here is the ethernet controller in detail:

Ethernet controller [1043:200f]
	Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16
	I/O ports at e000 [size=256]
	Memory at ef100000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]

Falling back to MSI fixes the issue.
