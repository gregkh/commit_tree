drm/amd/display: Read back max backlight value at boot

[Why]
If there is no program explicitly setting the backlight
brightness (for example, during a minimal install of linux), the
hardware defaults to maximum brightness but the backlight_device
defaults to 0 value.  Thus, settings displays the wrong brightness
value.

[How]
When creating the backlight device, set brightness to max
