r8169: fix NAPI handling under high load

rtl_rx() and rtl_tx() are called only if the respective bits are set
in the interrupt status register. Under high load NAPI may not be
able to process all data (work_done == budget) and it will schedule
subsequent calls to the poll callback.
rtl_ack_events() however resets the bits in the interrupt status
register, therefore subsequent calls to rtl8169_poll() won't call
rtl_rx() and rtl_tx() - chip interrupts are still disabled.

Fix this by calling rtl_rx() and rtl_tx() independent of the bits
set in the interrupt status register. Both functions will detect
if there's nothing to do for them.
