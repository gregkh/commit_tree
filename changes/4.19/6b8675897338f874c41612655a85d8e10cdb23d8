xdp: don't make drivers report attachment mode

prog_attached of struct netdev_bpf should have been superseded
by simply setting prog_id long time ago, but we kept it around
to allow offloading drivers to communicate attachment mode (drv
vs hw).  Subsequently drivers were also allowed to report back
attachment flags (prog_flags), and since nowadays only programs
attached will XDP_FLAGS_HW_MODE can get offloaded, we can tell
the attachment mode from the flags driver reports.  Remove
prog_attached member.
