s390/pci: fix out of bounds access during irq setup

During interrupt setup we allocate interrupt vectors, walk the list of msi
descriptors, and fill in the message data. Requesting more interrupts than
supported on s390 can lead to an out of bounds access.

When we restrict the number of interrupts we should also stop walking the
msi list after all supported interrupts are handled.
