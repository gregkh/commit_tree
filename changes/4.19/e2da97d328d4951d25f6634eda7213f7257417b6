arm_pmu: Add support for 64bit event counters

Each PMU has a set of 32bit event counters. But in some
special cases, the events could be counted using counters
which are effectively 64bit wide.

e.g, Arm V8 PMUv3 has a 64 bit cycle counter which can count
only the CPU cycles. Also, the PMU can chain the event counters
to effectively count as a 64bit counter.

Add support for tracking the events that uses 64bit counters.
This only affects the periods set for each counter in the core
driver.
