x86/cpufeatures: Add EPT_AD feature bit

Some Intel processors have an EPT feature whereby the accessed & dirty bits
in EPT entries can be updated by HW. MSR IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP exposes the
presence of this capability.

There is no point in trying to use that new feature bit in the VMX code as
VMX needs to read the MSR anyway to access other bits, but having the
feature bit for EPT_AD in place helps virtualization management as it
exposes "ept_ad" in /proc/cpuinfo/$proc/flags if the feature is present.
