ASoC: soc-pcm: DPCM cares BE channel constraint

Current DPCM is caring only FE channel configuration. Sometimes
it will be trouble if user selects channel which isn't supported
by BE.

This patch adds new .dpcm_merged_chan on struct snd_soc_dai_link.
DPCM will use FE / BE merged channel if struct snd_soc_dai_link
has it.
