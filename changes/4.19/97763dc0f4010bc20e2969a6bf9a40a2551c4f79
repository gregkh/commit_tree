net_sched: reject unknown tcfa_action values

After the commit 802bfb19152c ("net/sched: user-space can't set
unknown tcfa_action values"), unknown tcfa_action values are
converted to TC_ACT_UNSPEC, but the common agreement is instead
rejecting such configurations.

This change also introduces a helper to simplify the destruction
of a single action, avoiding code duplication.

v1 -> v2:
 - helper is now static and renamed according to act_* convention
 - updated extack message, according to the new behavior
