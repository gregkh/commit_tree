serial: sh-sci: Fix use-after-free on subsequent port startup

sci_request_irq() checks port->irqstr[j] for a NULL pointer, to decide
if a fallback interrupt name string should be allocated or not.

While this string is freed during port shutdown, the pointer is not
zeroed.  Hence on a subsequent startup of the port, it will still be
pointing to the freed memory, leading to e.g.

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 404 at fs/proc/generic.c:388 __proc_create+0xbc/0x260
    name len 0

or to a crash (the latter is more likely with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y, due
to the poisoning of freed memory).

Instead of zeroeing the pointer at multiple places, preinitialize
port->irqstr[j] to zero to fix this.
