crypto: hisilicon - SEC security accelerator driver

This accelerator is found inside hisilicon hip06 and hip07 SoCs.
Each instance provides a number of queues which feed a different number of
backend acceleration units.

The queues are operating in an out of order mode in the interests of
throughput. The silicon does not do tracking of dependencies between
multiple 'messages' or update of the IVs as appropriate for training.
Hence where relevant we need to do this in software.
