HID: i2c-hid: Remove RESEND_REPORT_DESCR quirk and its handling

Commit 52cf93e63ee6 ("HID: i2c-hid: Don't reset device upon system resume")
removes the need for the RESEND_REPORT_DESCR quirk for Raydium devices, but
kept it for the SIS device id 10FB touchscreens, as the author of that
commit could not determine if the quirk is still necessary there.

I've tested suspend/resume on a Toshiba Click Mini L9W-B which is the
device for which this quirk was added in the first place and with the
"Don't reset device upon system resume" fix the quirk is no longer
necessary, so this commit removes it.

Note even better I also had some other devices with SIS touchscreens which
suspend/resume issues, where the RESEND_REPORT_DESCR quirk did not help.

I've also tested these devices with the "Don't reset device upon system
resume" fix and I'm happy to report that that fix also fixes touchscreen
resume on the following devices:

Asus T100HA
Asus T200TA
Peaq C1010
