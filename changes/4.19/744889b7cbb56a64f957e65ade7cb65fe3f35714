block: don't deal with discard limit in blkdev_issue_discard()

blk_queue_split() does respect this limit via bio splitting, so no
need to do that in blkdev_issue_discard(), then we can align to
normal bio submit(bio_add_page() & submit_bio()).

More importantly, this patch fixes one issue introduced in a22c4d7e34402cc
("block: re-add discard_granularity and alignment checks"), in which
zero discard bio may be generated in case of zero alignment.

Fixes: a22c4d7e34402ccdf3 ("block: re-add discard_granularity and alignment checks")
