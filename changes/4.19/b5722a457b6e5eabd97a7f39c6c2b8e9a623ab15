x86/build/vdso: Remove unused vdso-syms.lds

This file contains symbol values, and was originally linked into
vmlinux, but I have no idea what it was actually used for.

Since the following commit:

  827880ec260b ("x86/um: thin archives build fix")

it is not even linked.  Now it is completely orphan, and no problem has
been reported.  It is a proof that this file was not needed in the
first place.
