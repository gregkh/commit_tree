drivers: base: initcall_debug logs for driver probe times

Add initcall_debug logs for each driver device probe call, for example:

   probe of a3800000.ramoops returned 1 after 3007 usecs

This replaces the previous code added to report times for deferred
probes.  It also reports OF platform bus device creates that were
formerly lumped together in a single entry for function
of_platform_default_populate_init, as well as helping to annotate other
initcalls that involve device probing.

Remove restriction on printing probe times only during initcalls, since
initcall_debug now continues to show driver timing info past the boot
phase.
