RDMA: Convert drivers to use sgid_attr instead of sgid_index

The core code now ensures that all driver callbacks that receive an
rdma_ah_attrs will have a sgid_attr's pointer if there is a GRH present.

Drivers can use this pointer instead of calling a query function with
sgid_index. This simplifies the drivers and also avoids races where a
gid_index lookup may return different data if it is changed.
