net: sched: atomically check-allocate action

Implement function that atomically checks if action exists and either takes
reference to it, or allocates idr slot for action index to prevent
concurrent allocations of actions with same index. Use EBUSY error pointer
to indicate that idr slot is reserved.

Implement cleanup helper function that removes temporary error pointer from
idr. (in case of error between idr allocation and insertion of newly
created action to specified index)

Refactor all action init functions to insert new action to idr using this
API.
