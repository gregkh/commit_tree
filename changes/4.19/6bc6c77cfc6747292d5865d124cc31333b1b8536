tracing/kprobes: Fix within_notrace_func() to check only notrace functions

Fix within_notrace_func() to check only notrace functions and to ignore the
kprobe-event which can not solve symbol addresses.

within_notrace_func() returns true if the given kprobe events probe point
seems to be out-of-range. But that is not the correct place to check for it,
it should be done in kprobes afterwards.

kprobe-events allow users to define a probe point on "currently unloaded
module" so that it can trace the event during module load. In this case, the
user will put a probe on a symbol which is not in kallsyms yet and it hits
the within_notrace_func().  As a result, kprobe-events always refuses if
user defines a probe on a "currenly unloaded module".

Fixes: commit 45408c4f9250 ("tracing: kprobes: Prohibit probing on notrace function")
