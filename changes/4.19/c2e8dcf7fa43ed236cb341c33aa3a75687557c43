bcache: avoid unncessary cache prefetch bch_btree_node_get()

In bch_btree_node_get() the read-in btree node will be partially
prefetched into L1 cache for following bset iteration (if there is).
But if the btree node read is failed, the perfetch operations will
waste L1 cache space. This patch checkes whether read operation and
only does cache prefetch when read I/O succeeded.
