crypto: ahash - remove useless setting of type flags

Many ahash algorithms set .cra_flags = CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AHASH.  But this
is redundant with the C structure type ('struct ahash_alg'), and
crypto_register_ahash() already sets the type flag automatically,
clearing any type flag that was already there.  Apparently the useless
assignment has just been copy+pasted around.

So, remove the useless assignment from all the ahash algorithms.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
