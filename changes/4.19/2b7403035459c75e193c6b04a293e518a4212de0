mm: Change return type int to vm_fault_t for fault handlers

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler.  For now, this is just
documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT value rather than an
errno.  Once all instances are converted, vm_fault_t will become a
distinct type.

Ref-> commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

The aim is to change the return type of finish_fault() and
handle_mm_fault() to vm_fault_t type.  As part of that clean up return
type of all other recursively called functions have been changed to
vm_fault_t type.

The places from where handle_mm_fault() is getting invoked will be
change to vm_fault_t type but in a separate patch.

vmf_error() is the newly introduce inline function in 4.17-rc6.
