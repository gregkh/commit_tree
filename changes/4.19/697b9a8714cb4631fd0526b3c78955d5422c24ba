drm/i915: Make closing request flush mandatory

For symmetry, simplicity and ensuring the request is always truly idle
upon its completion, always emit the closing flush prior to emitting the
request breadcrumb. Previously, we would only emit the flush if we had
started a user batch, but this just leaves all the other paths open to
speculation (do they affect the GPU caches or not?) With mm switching, a
key requirement is that the GPU is flushed and invalidated before hand,
so for absolute safety, we want that closing flush be mandatory.
