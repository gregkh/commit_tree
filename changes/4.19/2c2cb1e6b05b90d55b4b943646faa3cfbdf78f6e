PM / devfreq: Init user limits from OPP limits, not viceversa

Commit ab8f58ad72c4 ("PM / devfreq: Set min/max_freq when adding
the devfreq device") introduced the initialization of the user
limits min/max_freq from the lowest/highest available OPPs. Later
commit f1d981eaecf8 ("PM / devfreq: Use the available min/max
frequency") added scaling_min/max_freq, which actually represent
the frequencies of the lowest/highest available OPP. scaling_min/
max_freq are initialized with the values from min/max_freq, which
is totally correct in the context, but a bit awkward to read.

Swap the initialization and assign scaling_min/max_freq with the
OPP freqs and then the user limts min/max_freq with scaling_min/
max_freq.

Needless to say that this change is a NOP, intended to improve
readability.
