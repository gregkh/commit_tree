bpf: add End.DT6 action to bpf_lwt_seg6_action helper

The seg6local LWT provides the End.DT6 action, which allows to
decapsulate an outer IPv6 header containing a Segment Routing Header
(SRH), full specification is available here:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming-05

This patch adds this action now to the seg6local BPF
interface. Since it is not mandatory that the inner IPv6 header also
contains a SRH, seg6_bpf_srh_state has been extended with a pointer to
a possible SRH of the outermost IPv6 header. This helps assessing if the
validation must be triggered or not, and avoids some calls to
ipv6_find_hdr.

v3: s/1/true, s/0/false for boolean values
v2: - changed true/false -> 1/0
    - preempt_enable no longer called in first conditional block
