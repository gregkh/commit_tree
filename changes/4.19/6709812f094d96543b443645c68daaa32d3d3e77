x86/entry/64: Add two more instruction suffixes

Sadly, other than claimed in:

  a368d7fd2a ("x86/entry/64: Add instruction suffix")

... there are two more instances which want to be adjusted.

As said there, omitting suffixes from instructions in AT&T mode is bad
practice when operand size cannot be determined by the assembler from
register operands, and is likely going to be warned about by upstream
gas in the future (mine does already).

Add the other missing suffixes here as well.
