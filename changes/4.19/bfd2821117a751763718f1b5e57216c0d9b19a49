rxrpc: Don't need to take the RCU read lock in the packet receiver

We don't need to take the RCU read lock in the rxrpc packet receive
function because it's held further up the stack in the IP input routine
around the UDP receive routines.

Fix this by dropping the RCU read lock calls from rxrpc_input_packet().
This simplifies the code.
