xfrm: Extend the output_mark to support input direction and masking.

We already support setting an output mark at the xfrm_state,
unfortunately this does not support the input direction and
masking the marks that will be applied to the skb. This change
adds support applying a masked value in both directions.

The existing XFRMA_OUTPUT_MARK number is reused for this purpose
and as it is now bi-directional, it is renamed to XFRMA_SET_MARK.

An additional XFRMA_SET_MARK_MASK attribute is added for setting the
mask. If the attribute mask not provided, it is set to 0xffffffff,
keeping the XFRMA_OUTPUT_MARK existing 'full mask' semantics.
