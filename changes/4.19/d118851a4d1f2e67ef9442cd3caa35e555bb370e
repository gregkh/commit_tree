USB: serial: kl5kusb105: remove KLSI device id

This driver was apparently never tested with an actual KLSI device. In
fact, even the device-id entry which was supposed to allow for this had
a typo in it.

Tests now reveal that the predicted firmware differences with the
PalmConnect adapters are real and that the driver does not support KLSI
devices with PID 0x000c, so let's remove the broken entry.
