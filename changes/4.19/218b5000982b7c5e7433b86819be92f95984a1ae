drm/i915: drop one bit on the hw_id when using guc

We currently using GuC as a proxy to the hardware. When Guc is used in
such mode, it consumes the bit 20 of the hw_id to indicate that the
workload was submitted by proxy.

So far we probably haven't seen the issue because we need to allocate
1048576+ contexts to hit this issue. Still, we should avoid allocating
the hw_id on that bit and restriction to bits [0:19] (i.e 20bits
instead of 21).

v2: Leave the max hw_id computation in i915_gem_context.c (Michel)

v3: Be consistent on if/else usage (Chris)
