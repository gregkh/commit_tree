ARM: net: bpf: remove is_on_stack() and sstk/dstk

The decision about whether a BPF register is on the stack or in a CPU
register is detected at the top BPF insn processing level, and then
percolated throughout the remainder of the code.  Since we now use
negative register values to represent stacked registers, we can detect
where a BPF register is stored without restoring to carrying this
additional metadata through all code paths.
