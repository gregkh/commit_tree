xen/gntdev: don't dereference a null gntdev_dmabuf on allocation failure

Currently when the allocation of gntdev_dmabuf fails, the error exit
path will call dmabuf_imp_free_storage and causes a null pointer
dereference on gntdev_dmabuf.  Fix this by adding an error exit path
that won't free gntdev_dmabuf.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1472124 ("Dereference after null check")
