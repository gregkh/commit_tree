powerpc/64s: Fix page table fragment refcount race vs speculative references

The page table fragment allocator uses the main page refcount racily
with respect to speculative references. A customer observed a BUG due
to page table page refcount underflow in the fragment allocator. This
can be caused by the fragment allocator set_page_count stomping on a
speculative reference, and then the speculative failure handler
decrements the new reference, and the underflow eventually pops when
the page tables are freed.

Fix this by using a dedicated field in the struct page for the page
table fragment allocator.
