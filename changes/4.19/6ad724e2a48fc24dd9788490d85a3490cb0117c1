checkpatch: check for space after "else" keyword

Current checkpatch implementation permits notation like

	} else{

in kernel code.  It looks like oversight and inconsistency in checkpatch
rules (e.g.  instruction like 'do' is tested).

Add regex for checking space after 'else' keyword and trigger error if
space is not present.
