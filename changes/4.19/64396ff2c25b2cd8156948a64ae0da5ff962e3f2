xfs: remove xfs_alloc_arg firstblock field

The xfs_alloc_arg.firstblock field is used to control the starting
agno for an allocation. The structure already carries a pointer to
the transaction, which carries the current firstblock value.

Remove the field and access ->t_firstblock directly in the
allocation code.
