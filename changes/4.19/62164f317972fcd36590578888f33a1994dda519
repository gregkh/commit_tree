NFS add support for asynchronous COPY

Change xdr to always send COPY asynchronously.

Keep the list copies send in a list under a server structure.
Once copy is sent, it waits on a completion structure that will
be signalled by the callback thread that receives CB_OFFLOAD.

If CB_OFFLOAD returned an error and even if it returned partial
bytes, ignore them (as we can't commit without a verifier to
match) and return an error.
