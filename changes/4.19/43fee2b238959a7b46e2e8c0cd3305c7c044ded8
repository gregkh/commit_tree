kbuild: do not redirect the first prerequisite for filechk

Currently, filechk unconditionally opens the first prerequisite and
redirects it as the stdin of a filechk_* rule.  Hence, every target
using $(call filechk,...) must list something as the first prerequisite
even if it is unneeded.

'< $<' is actually unneeded in most cases.  Each rule can explicitly
adds it if necessary.
