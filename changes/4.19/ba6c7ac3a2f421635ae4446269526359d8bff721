mmc: core: more fine-grained hooks for HS400 tuning

This adds two new HS400 tuning operations:
* hs400_downgrade
* hs400_complete

These supplement the existing HS400 operation:
* prepare_hs400_tuning

This is motivated by a requirement of Renesas SDHI for the following:
1. Disabling SCC before selecting to HS if selection of HS400 has occurred.
   This can be done in an implementation of prepare_hs400_tuning_downgrade
2. Updating registers after switching to HS400
   This can be done in an implementation of complete_hs400_tuning

If hs400_downgrade or hs400_complete are not implemented then they are not
called. Thus means there should be no affect for existing drivers as none
implemt these ops.
