cachefiles: fix the race between cachefiles_bury_object() and rmdir(2)

the victim might've been rmdir'ed just before the lock_rename();
unlike the normal callers, we do not look the source up after the
parents are locked - we know it beforehand and just recheck that it's
still the child of what used to be its parent.  Unfortunately,
the check is too weak - we don't spot a dead directory since its
->d_parent is unchanged, dentry is positive, etc.  So we sail all
the way to ->rename(), with hosting filesystems _not_ expecting
to be asked renaming an rmdir'ed subdirectory.

The fix is easy, fortunately - the lock on parent is sufficient for
making IS_DEADDIR() on child safe.
