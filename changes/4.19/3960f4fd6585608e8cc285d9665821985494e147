bpf: fix rcu annotations in compute_effective_progs()

The progs local variable in compute_effective_progs() is marked
as __rcu, which is not correct. This is a local pointer, which
is initialized by bpf_prog_array_alloc(), which also now
returns a generic non-rcu pointer.

The real rcu-protected pointer is *array (array is a pointer
to an RCU-protected pointer), so the assignment should be performed
using rcu_assign_pointer().
