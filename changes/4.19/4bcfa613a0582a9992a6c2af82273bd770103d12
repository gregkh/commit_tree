xfs: use ->t_dfops for all xfs_bunmapi() callers

Use ->t_dfops for all remaining xfs_bunmapi() callers. This prepares
the latter to no longer require a dfops parameter.

Note that xfs_itruncate_extents_flags() associates a local dfops
with a transaction provided from the caller. Since there are
multiple callers, set and reset ->t_dfops before the function
returns to avoid exposure of stack memory to the caller.
