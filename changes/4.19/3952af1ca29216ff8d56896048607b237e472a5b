ARM: davinci: da830: add new clock init using common clock framework

This adds the new board-specific clock init in mach-davinci/da830.c
using the new common clock framework drivers.

The #ifdefs are needed to prevent compile errors until the entire
ARCH_DAVINCI is converted.

Also clean up the #includes since we are adding some here.
