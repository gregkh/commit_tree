arm64: KVM: Only force FPEXC32_EL2.EN if trapping FPSIMD

If trapping FPSIMD in the context of an AArch32 guest, it is critical
to set FPEXC32_EL2.EN to 1 so that the trapping is taken to EL2 and
not EL1.

Conversely, it is just as critical *not* to set FPEXC32_EL2.EN to 1
if we're not going to trap FPSIMD, as we then corrupt the existing
VFP state.

Moving the call to __activate_traps_fpsimd32 to the point where we
know for sure that we are going to trap ensures that we don't set that
bit spuriously.
