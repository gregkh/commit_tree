paride: remove redundant variable n

Variable n is being assigned but is never used hence it is redundant
and can be removed. Also put spacing between variables in declaration
to clean up checkpatch warnings.

Cleans up clang warning:
warning: variable 'n' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
