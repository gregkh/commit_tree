staging: rtl8723bs: drop test

The test selects between two identical values, so it doesn't look useful.
It turns out that the tested expression can only be true anyway, so drop
the test, the corresponding parameter, and the corresponding argument at
the only call site.

The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:

expression e,e1;

* e ? e1 : e1
// </smpl>
