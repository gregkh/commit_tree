lib/test_printf.c: accept "ptrval" as valid result for plain 'p' tests

If the test_printf module is loaded before the crng is initialized, the
plain 'p' tests will fail because the printed address will not be hashed
and the buffer will contain "(____ptrval____)" or "(ptrval)" instead
(64-bit vs 32-bit).
Since we cannot wait for the crng to be initialized for an undefined
time, both plain 'p' tests now accept the strings "(____ptrval____)" or
"(ptrval)" as a valid result and print a warning message.
