net: socionext: Use descriptor info instead of MMIO reads on Rx

MMIO reads for remaining packets in queue occur (at least)twice per
invocation of netsec_process_rx(). We can use the packet descriptor to
identify if it's owned by the hardware and break out, avoiding the more
expensive MMIO read operations. This has a ~2% increase on the pps of the
Rx path when tested with 64byte packets
