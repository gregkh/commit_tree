devlink: Add support for creating region snapshots

Each device address region can store multiple snapshots,
each snapshot is identified using a different numerical ID.
This ID is used when deleting a snapshot or showing an address
region specific snapshot. This patch exposes a callback to add
a new snapshot to an address region.
The snapshot will be deleted using the destructor function
when destroying a region or when a snapshot delete command
from devlink user tool.
