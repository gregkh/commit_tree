gpio: Add API to explicitly name a consumer

The GPIO (descriptor) API registers a "label" naming what is
currently using the GPIO line. Typically this is taken from
things like the device tree node, so "reset-gpios" will result
in he line being labeled "reset".

The technical effect is pretty much zero: the use is for
debug and introspection, such as "lsgpio" and debugfs files.

However sometimes the user want this cuddly feeling of
listing all GPIO lines and seeing exactly what they are for
and it gives a very fulfilling sense of control. Especially
in the cases when the device tree node doesn't provide a
good name, or anonymous GPIO lines assigned just to
"gpios" in the device tree because the usage is implicit.

For these cases it may be nice to be able to label the
line directly and explicitly.
