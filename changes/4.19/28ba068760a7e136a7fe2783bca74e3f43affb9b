samples/bpf: extend test_cgrp2_attach2 test to use cgroup storage

The test_cgrp2_attach test covers bpf cgroup attachment code well,
so let's re-use it for testing allocation/releasing of cgroup storage.

The extension is pretty straightforward: the bpf program will use
the cgroup storage to save the number of transmitted bytes.

Expected output:
  $ ./test_cgrp2_attach2
  Attached DROP prog. This ping in cgroup /foo should fail...
  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
  Attached DROP prog. This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should fail...
  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
  Attached PASS prog. This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should pass...
  Detached PASS from /foo/bar while DROP is attached to /foo.
  This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should fail...
  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
  Attached PASS from /foo/bar and detached DROP from /foo.
  This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should pass...
  ### override:PASS
  ### multi:PASS
