Partially revert "locks: fix file locking on overlayfs"

This partially reverts commit c568d68341be7030f5647def68851e469b21ca11.

Overlayfs files will now automatically get the correct locks, no need to
hack overlay support in VFS.

It is a partial revert, because it leaves the locks_inode() calls in place
and defines locks_inode() to file_inode().  We could revert those as well,
but it would be unnecessary code churn and it makes sense to document that
we are getting the inode for locking purposes.

Don't revert MS_NOREMOTELOCK yet since that has been part of the userspace
API for some time (though not in a useful way).  Will try to remove
internal flags later when the dust around the new mount API settles.
