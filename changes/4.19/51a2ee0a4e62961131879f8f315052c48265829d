staging: rtl8188eu/rtl8723bs: fix character encoding

drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/include/odm.h uses an incorrect encoding
for the '...' character in two comments, which makes it one of the
few non-UTF-8 source files.

This removes the odd characters and uses the same ASCII representation
that we have in the regular rtlwifi driver. The second instance
of drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/hal/odm.h is garbled in a different way,
so I change it to be the same as well even though it is already
plain ASCII.
