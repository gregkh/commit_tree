partitions/aix: append null character to print data from disk

Even if properly initialized, the lvname array (i.e., strings)
is read from disk, and might contain corrupt data (e.g., lack
the null terminating character for strings).

So, make sure the partition name string used in pr_warn() has
the null terminating character.
