drm/i915: Pull the context->pin_count dec into the common intel_context_unpin

As all backends implement the same pin_count mechanism and do a
dec-and-test as their first step, pull that into the common
intel_context_unpin(). This also pulls into the caller, eliminating the
indirect call in the usual steady state case. The intel_context_pin()
side is a little more complicated as it combines the lookup/alloc as
well as pinning the state, and so is left for a later date.
