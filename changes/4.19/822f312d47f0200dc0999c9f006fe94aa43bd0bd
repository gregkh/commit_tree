kvm: x86: make kvm_{load|put}_guest_fpu() static

The functions
	kvm_load_guest_fpu()
	kvm_put_guest_fpu()

are only used locally, make them static. This requires also that both
functions are moved because they are used before their implementation.
Those functions were exported (via EXPORT_SYMBOL) before commit
e5bb40251a920 ("KVM: Drop kvm_{load,put}_guest_fpu() exports").
