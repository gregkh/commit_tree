gfs2: Fix iomap buffered write support for journaled files

Commit 64bc06bb32ee broke buffered writes to journaled files (chattr
+j): we'll try to journal the buffer heads of the page being written to
in gfs2_iomap_journaled_page_done.  However, the iomap code no longer
creates buffer heads, so we'll BUG() in gfs2_page_add_databufs.  Fix
that by creating buffer heads ourself when needed.
