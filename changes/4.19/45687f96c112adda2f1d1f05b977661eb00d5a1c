PCI/AER: Don't clear AER bits if error handling is Firmware-First

If the platform requests Firmware-First error handling, firmware is
responsible for reading and clearing AER status bits.  If OSPM also clears
them, we may miss errors.  See ACPI v6.2, sec 18.3.2.5 and 18.4.

This race is mostly of theoretical significance, as it is not easy to
reasonably demonstrate it in testing.
