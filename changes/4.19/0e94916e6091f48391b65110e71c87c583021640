PCI: pciehp: Handle events synchronously

Up until now, pciehp's IRQ handler schedules a work item for each event,
which in turn schedules a work item to enable or disable the slot.  This
double indirection was necessary because sleeping wasn't allowed in the
IRQ handler.

However it is now that pciehp has been converted to threaded IRQ handling
and polling, so handle events synchronously in pciehp_ist() and remove
the work item infrastructure (with the exception of work items to handle
a button press after the 5 second delay).

For link or presence change events, move the register read to determine
the current link or presence state behind acquisition of the slot lock
to prevent it from becoming stale while the lock is contended.
