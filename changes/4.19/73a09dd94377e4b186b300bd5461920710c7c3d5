introduce FMODE_CREATED and switch to it

Parallel to FILE_CREATED, goes into ->f_mode instead of *opened.
NFS is a bit of a wart here - it doesn't have file at the point
where FILE_CREATED used to be set, so we need to propagate it
there (for now).  IMA is another one (here and everywhere)...

Note that this needs do_dentry_open() to leave old bits in ->f_mode
alone - we want it to preserve FMODE_CREATED if it had been already
set (no other bit can be there).
