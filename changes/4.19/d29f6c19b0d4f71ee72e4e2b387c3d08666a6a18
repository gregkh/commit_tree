Revert "staging: gasket: page table: hold references to device and pci_dev"

gasket_free_dev() is called only from driver PCI probe and remove
function. It is guaranteed that that pci_dev structure is not going
anywhere during that time; there is no need to take this additional
reference.

This reverts commit dd9d1502feea3c23d412f289aad79e1d4e86d45d.
