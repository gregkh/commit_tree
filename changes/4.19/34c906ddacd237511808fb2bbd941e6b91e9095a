ASoC: rt5651: Allow disabling jack-detect by calling set_jack(NULL)

Allow the machine driver to disable jack-detect over a suspend/resume by
calling snd_soc_component_set_jack(NULL).

Note this renames rt5651_set_jack, where all the jack-enable work was done
to rt5651_enable_jack_detect. This function can now no longer fail as it
does not request the IRQ anymore. It can still be passed an invalid jack
source, but that should never happen, so this is now logged and treated as
no jack source.
