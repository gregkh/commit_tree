Raise the minimum required gcc version to 4.6

Various architectures fail to build properly with older versions of the
gcc compiler.

An example from Guenter Roeck in thread [1]:

So update the minimum required version of gcc to 4.6.

Miscellanea:

 - Update Documentation/process/changes.rst

 - Remove and consolidate version test blocks in compiler-gcc.h for
   versions lower than 4.6
