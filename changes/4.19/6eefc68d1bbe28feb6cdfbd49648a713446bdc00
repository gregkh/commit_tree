serial: sh-sci: Stop using deprecated dmaengine_terminate_all()

As of commit b36f09c3c441a6e5 ("dmaengine: Add transfer termination
synchronization support"), dmaengine_terminate_all() is deprecated.

Replace calls to dmaengine_terminate_all() in DMA release code by calls
to dmaengine_terminate_sync(), as the latter waits until all running
completion callbacks have finished.

Replace calls to dmaengine_terminate_all() in DMA failure paths by calls
to dmaengine_terminate_async(), as these are usually done in atomic
context.
