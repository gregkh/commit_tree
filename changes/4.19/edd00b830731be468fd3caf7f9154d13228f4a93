powerpc/tm: Remove struct thread_info param from tm_reclaim_thread()

Since commit dc3106690b20 ("powerpc: tm: Always use fp_state and
vr_state to store live registers") tm_reclaim_thread() doesn't use the
parameter anymore, both callers have to bother getting it as they have
no need for a struct thread_info either.

Just remove it and adjust the callers.
