drm/i915: Promote .format_mod_supported() to the lead role

Up to now we've used the plane's modifier list as the primary
source of information for which modifiers are supported by a
given plane. In order to allow auxiliary metadata to be embedded
within the bits of the modifier we need to stop doing that.

Thus we have to make .format_mod_supported() aware of the plane's
capabilities and gracefully deal with any modifier being passed
in directly from userspace.

v2: Rebase after NV12
    Simplify
