x86/tsc: Initialize cyc2ns when tsc frequency is determined

cyc2ns converts tsc to nanoseconds, and it is handled in a per-cpu data
structure.

Currently, the setup code for c2ns data for every possible CPU goes through
the same sequence of calculations as for the boot CPU, but is based on the
same tsc frequency as the boot CPU, and thus this is not necessary.

Initialize the boot cpu when tsc frequency is determined. Copy the
calculated data from the boot CPU to the other CPUs in tsc_init().

In addition do the following:

 - Remove unnecessary zeroing of c2ns data by removing cyc2ns_data_init()

 - Split set_cyc2ns_scale() into two functions, so set_cyc2ns_scale() can be
   called when system is up, and wraps around __set_cyc2ns_scale() that can
   be called directly when system is booting but avoids saving restoring
   IRQs and going and waking up from idle.
