drm/i915/execlists: Process one CSB update at a time

In the next patch, we will process the CSB events directly from the
submission path, rather than only after a CS interrupt. Hence, we will
no longer have the need for a loop until the has-interrupt bit is clear,
and in the meantime can remove that small optimisation.

v2: Tvrtko pointed out it was safer to unconditionally kick the tasklet
after each irq, when assuming that the tasklet is called for each irq.
