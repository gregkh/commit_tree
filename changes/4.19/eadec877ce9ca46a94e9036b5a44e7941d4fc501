net: Add support for subordinate traffic classes to netdev_pick_tx

This change makes it so that we can support the concept of subordinate
device traffic classes to the core networking code. In doing this we can
start pulling out the driver specific bits needed to support selecting a
queue based on an upper device.

The solution at is currently stands is only partially implemented. I have
the start of some XPS bits in here, but I would still need to allow for
configuration of the XPS maps on the queues reserved for the subordinate
devices. For now I am using the reference to the sb_dev XPS map as just a
way to skip the lookup of the lower device XPS map for now as that would
result in the wrong queue being picked.
