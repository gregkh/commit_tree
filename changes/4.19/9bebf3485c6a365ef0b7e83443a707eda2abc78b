thermal: ti-soc-thermal: remove dead code

Majority of this code (i.e. functions from ti-bandgap.c) has been
introduced in May 2013 by commit eb982001dbd8 ("thermal: introduce TI
SoC thermal driver"). Just remove it altogether (in case it is needed
it can be easily resurrected from git repo).

While at it fix incorrect "not used" comments.
