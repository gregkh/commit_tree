x86/intel_rdt: Associate mode with each RDT resource group

Each RDT resource group is associated with a mode that will reflect
the level of sharing of its allocations. The default, shareable, will be
associated with each resource group on creation since it is zero and
resource groups are created with kzalloc. The managing of the mode of a
resource group will follow. The default resource group always remain
though so ensure that it is reset to the default mode when the resctrl
filesystem is unmounted.

Also introduce a utility that can be used to determine the mode of a
resource group when it is searched for based on its class of service.
