nvme: move init of keep_alive work item to controller initialization

Currently, the code initializes the keep alive work item whenever
nvme_start_keep_alive() is called. However, this routine is called
several times while reconnecting, etc. Although it's hoped that keep
alive is always disabled and not scheduled when start is called,
re-initing if it were scheduled or completing can have very bad
side effects. There's no need for re-initialization.

Move the keep_alive work item and cmd struct initialization to
controller init.
