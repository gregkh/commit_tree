mm/memblock.c: replace u64 with phys_addr_t where appropriate

Most functions in memblock already use phys_addr_t to represent a
physical address with __memblock_free_late() being an exception.

This patch replaces u64 with phys_addr_t in __memblock_free_late() and
switches several format strings from %llx to %pa to avoid casting from
phys_addr_t to u64.
