ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add support for externar amplifier enable GPIO

The rt5651 does not have a built-in speaker amplifier, so it is often
used together with an external amplifier. On Cherry Trail boards this
external amplifier's enable pin is driven through a GPIO, which is
given as the first GPIO in the ACPI resources of the codec fwnode.

This commit adds support to the bytcr_rt5651 for this GPIO, fixing
the speaker not working on CHT devices with a rt5651 codec.
