sctp: add support for SCTP_REUSE_PORT sockopt

This feature is actually already supported by sk->sk_reuse which can be
set by socket level opt SO_REUSEADDR. But it's not working exactly as
RFC6458 demands in section 8.1.27, like:

  - This option only supports one-to-one style SCTP sockets
  - This socket option must not be used after calling bind()
    or sctp_bindx().

Besides, SCTP_REUSE_PORT sockopt should be provided for user's programs.
Otherwise, the programs with SCTP_REUSE_PORT from other systems will not
work in linux.

To separate it from the socket level version, this patch adds 'reuse' in
sctp_sock and it works pretty much as sk->sk_reuse, but with some extra
setup limitations that are needed when it is being enabled.

"It should be noted that the behavior of the socket-level socket option
to reuse ports and/or addresses for SCTP sockets is unspecified", so it
leaves SO_REUSEADDR as is for the compatibility.

Note that the name SCTP_REUSE_PORT is somewhat confusing, as its
functionality is nearly identical to SO_REUSEADDR, but with some
extra restrictions. Here it uses 'reuse' in sctp_sock instead of
'reuseport'. As for sk->sk_reuseport support for SCTP, it will be
added in another patch.

Thanks to Neil to make this clear.

v1->v2:
  - add sctp_sk->reuse to separate it from the socket level version.
v2->v3:
  - improve changelog according to Marcelo's suggestion.
