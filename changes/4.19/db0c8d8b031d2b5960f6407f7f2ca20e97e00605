x86/gpu: reserve ICL's graphics stolen memory

ICL changes the registers and addresses to 64 bits.

I also briefly looked at implementing an u64 version of the PCI config
read functions, but I concluded this wouldn't be trivial, so it's not
worth doing it for a single user that can't have any racing problems
while reading the register in two separate operations.

v2:
 - Scrub the development (non-public) changelog (Joonas).
 - Remove the i915.ko bits so this can be easily backported in order
   to properly avoid stolen memory even on machines without i915.ko
   (Joonas).
 - CC stable for the reasons above.
