drm/amd/display: Check if clock source in use before disabling

[why]
We are disabling clock source while other pipes are still using
it, because we don't verify the number of pipes that share it.

[how]
- Adding a function in resources to return the number of pipes
sharing the clock source.
- Checking that no one is sharing the clock source before disabling
