sched/numa: Set preferred_node based on best_cpu

Currently preferred node is set to dst_nid which is the last node in the
iteration whose group weight or task weight is greater than the current
node. However it doesn't guarantee that dst_nid has the numa capacity
to move. It also doesn't guarantee that dst_nid has the best_cpu which
is the CPU/node ideal for node migration.

Lets consider faults on a 4 node system with group weight numbers
in different nodes being in 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 proportion. Consider the task
is running on 3 and 0 is its preferred node but its capacity is full.
Consider nodes 1, 2 and 3 have capacity. Then the task should be
migrated to node 1. Currently the task gets moved to node 2. env.dst_nid
points to the last node whose faults were greater than current node.

Modify to set the preferred node based of best_cpu. Earlier setting
preferred node was skipped if nr_active_nodes is 1. This could result in
the task being moved out of the preferred node to a random node during
regular load balancing.

Also while modifying task_numa_migrate(), use sched_setnuma to set
preferred node. This ensures out numa accounting is correct.
