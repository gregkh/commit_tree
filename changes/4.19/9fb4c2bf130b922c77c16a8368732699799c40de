ASoC: soc-pcm: Use delay set in component pointer function

Take into account the base delay set in pointer callback.

There are cases where a pointer function populates
runtime->delay, such as:
./sound/pci/hda/hda_controller.c
./sound/soc/intel/atom/sst-mfld-platform-pcm.c

This delay was getting lost and was overwritten by delays
from codec or cpu dai delay function if exposed.

Now,
Total delay = base delay + cpu_dai delay + codec_dai delay
