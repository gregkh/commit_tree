tracing: Add -mcount-nop option support

-mcount-nop gcc option generates the calls to the profiling functions
as nops which allows to avoid patching mcount jump with NOP instructions
initially.

-mcount-nop gcc option will be activated if platform selects
HAVE_NOP_MCOUNT and gcc actually supports it.
In addition to that CC_USING_NOP_MCOUNT is defined and could be used by
architectures to adapt ftrace patching behavior.
