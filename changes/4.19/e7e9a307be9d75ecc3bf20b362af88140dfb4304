staging: erofs: introduce workstation for decompression

This patch introduces another concept used by the unzip
subsystem called 'workstation'. It can be seen as a sparse
array that stores pointers pointed to data structures
related to the corresponding physical blocks.

All lookup cases are protected by RCU read lock. Besides,
reference count and spin_lock are also introduced to
manage its lifetime and serialize all update operations.

'workstation' is currently implemented on the in-kernel
radix tree approach for backward compatibility.
With the evolution of linux kernel, it could be migrated
into XArray implementation in the future.
