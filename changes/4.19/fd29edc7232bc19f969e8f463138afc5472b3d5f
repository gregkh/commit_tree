staging: speakup: Replace strncpy with memcpy

gcc 8.1.0 generates the following warnings.

drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c: In function 'punc_store':
drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:522:2: warning:
	'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul
	copying as many bytes from a string as its length
drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:504:6: note: length computed here

drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c: In function 'synth_store':
drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:391:2: warning:
	'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul
	copying as many bytes from a string as its length
drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:388:8: note: length computed here

Using strncpy() is indeed less than perfect since the length of data to
be copied has already been determined with strlen(). Replace strncpy()
with memcpy() to address the warning and optimize the code a little.
