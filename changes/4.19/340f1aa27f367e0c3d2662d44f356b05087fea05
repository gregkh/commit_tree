btrfs: qgroups: Move transaction management inside btrfs_quota_enable/disable

Commit 5d23515be669 ("btrfs: Move qgroup rescan on quota enable to
btrfs_quota_enable") not only resulted in an easier to follow code but
it also introduced a subtle bug. It changed the timing when the initial
transaction rescan was happening:

- before the commit: it would happen after transaction commit had occured
- after the commit: it might happen before the transaction was committed

This results in failure to correctly rescan the quota since there could
be data which is still not committed on disk.

This patch aims to fix this by moving the transaction creation/commit
inside btrfs_quota_enable, which allows to schedule the quota commit
after the transaction has been committed.
