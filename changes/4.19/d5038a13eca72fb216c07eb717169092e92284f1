scsi: core: switch to scsi-mq by default

It has been more than one year since we tried to change the default from
legacy to multi queue in SCSI with commit c279bd9e406 ("scsi: default to
scsi-mq"). But due to issues with suspend/resume and performance problems
it had been reverted again with commit cbe7dfa26eee ("Revert "scsi: default
to scsi-mq"").

In the meantime there have been a substantial amount of performance
improvements and suspend/resume got fixed as well, thus we can re-enable
scsi-mq without a significant performance penalty.
