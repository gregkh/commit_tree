tools: bpftool: allow users to specify program type for prog load

Sometimes program section names don't match with libbpf's expectation.
In particular XDP's default section names differ between libbpf and
iproute2.  Allow users to pass program type on command line.  Name
the types like the libbpf expected section names.
