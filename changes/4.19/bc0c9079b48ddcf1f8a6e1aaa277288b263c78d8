NFS handle COPY reply CB_OFFLOAD call race

It's possible that server replies back with CB_OFFLOAD call and
COPY reply at the same time such that client will process
CB_OFFLOAD before reply to COPY. For that keep a list of pending
callback stateids received and then before waiting on completion
check the pending list.

Cleanup any pending copies on the client shutdown.
