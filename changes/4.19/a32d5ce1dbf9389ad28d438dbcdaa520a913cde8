ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta FIQ: Keep serio input GPIOs requested

From the very beginning, input GPIO pins of ams-delta serio port have
been used by FIQ handler, not serio driver.

Don't request those pins from the ams-delta-serio driver any longer,
instead keep them requested and initialized by the FIQ initialization
routine which already requests them and releases while identifying GPIO
IRQs.
