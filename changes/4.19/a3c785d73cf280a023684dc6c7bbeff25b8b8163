net/mlx5e: Vxlan, rename from mlx5e to mlx5

Rename vxlan functions from mlx5e_vxlan_* to mlx5_vxlan_*.
Rename mlx5e_vxlan_db to mlx5_vxlan and move it from en.h to vxlan.c
since it is not related to mlx5e anymore.

Allocate mlx5_vxlan structure dynamically in order to make it easier to
move later to core driver and to make it private in vxlan.c.

This is in preparation to move vxlan API to mlx5 core.
