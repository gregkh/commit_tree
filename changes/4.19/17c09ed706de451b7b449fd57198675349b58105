mtd: rawnand: fsmc: Allow selection of this driver when COMPILE_TEST=y

It just makes NAND maintainers' life easier by allowing them to
compile-test this driver without having PLAT_SPEAR, ARCH_NOMADIK,
ARCH_U8500 or MACH_U300 enabled.

We also need to add a dependency on HAS_IOMEM to make sure the driver
compiles correctly.
