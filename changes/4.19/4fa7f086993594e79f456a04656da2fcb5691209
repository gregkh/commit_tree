audit: simplify audit_enabled check in audit_watch_log_rule_change()

Check the audit_enabled flag and bail immediately.  This does not change
the functionality, but brings the code format in line with similar
checks in audit_tree_log_remove_rule(), audit_mark_log_rule_change(),
and elsewhere in the audit code.
