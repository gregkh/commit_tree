ovl: Store lower data inode in ovl_inode

Right now ovl_inode stores inode pointer for lower inode.  This helps with
quickly getting lower inode given overlay inode (ovl_inode_lower()).

Now with metadata only copy-up, we can have metacopy inode in middle layer
as well and inode containing data can be different from ->lower.  I need to
be able to open the real file in ovl_open_realfile() and for that I need to
quickly find the lower data inode.

Hence store lower data inode also in ovl_inode.  Also provide an helper
ovl_inode_lowerdata() to access this field.
