net: sched: add 'delete' function to action ops

Extend action ops with 'delete' function. Each action type to implements
its own delete function that doesn't depend on rtnl lock.

Implement delete function that is required to delete actions without
holding rtnl lock. Use action API function that atomically deletes action
only if it is still in action idr. This implementation prevents concurrent
threads from deleting same action twice.
