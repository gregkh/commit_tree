usb: dwc2: Turn on uframe_sched on "bcm" platforms

There's no reason to have the uframe scheduler off on dwc2.  Running
with uframe_sched = False is equivalent to saying "I don't want to run
the correct code, I want to run the old and incorrect code".

The uframe scheduler has been off on Broadcom since commit
58b179dcf28c ("staging: dwc2: disable uframe_sched on the bcm2835").
Since then there have been many many improvements, notably the commit
9f9f09b048f5 ("usb: dwc2: host: Totally redo the microframe
scheduler")

Presumably if everyone is good w/ the uframe_sched turned back on we
can kill all the old and crufty non-uframe sched code.
