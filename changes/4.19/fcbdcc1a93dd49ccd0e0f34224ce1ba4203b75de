ALSA: hda/via - Rewrite with error goto

Currently VIA codec driver invokes via_free() at each place of the
error path.  Move the error handling to the end of each function
commonly and do goto-error as a standard idiom.

This is a preliminary patch for the further cleanups, and no
functional changes.
