parisc: Drop architecture-specific ENOTSUP define

parisc is the only Linux architecture which has defined a value for ENOTSUP.
All other architectures #define ENOTSUP as EOPNOTSUPP in their libc headers.

Having an own value for ENOTSUP which is different than EOPNOTSUPP often gives
problems with userspace programs which expect both to be the same.  One such
example is a build error in the libuv package, as can be seen in
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=900237.

Since we dropped HP-UX support, there is no real benefit in keeping an own
value for ENOTSUP. This patch drops the parisc value for ENOTSUP from the
kernel sources. glibc needs no patch, it reuses the exported headers.
