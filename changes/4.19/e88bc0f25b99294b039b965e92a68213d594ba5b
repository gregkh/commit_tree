selftests: forwarding: Allow importing dependent libraries

The next patch introduces a new mlxsw-specific test that uses
mirror_gre_lib.sh and mirror_gre_topo_lib.sh.

However when sourcing their own deps, these libraries assume that the
test that's running is in the same directory. That's not the case for
driver-specific tests.

So change the libraries to source their deps through $relative_path.
That variable is set up by lib.sh, which should be imported by the test
in question in any case.
