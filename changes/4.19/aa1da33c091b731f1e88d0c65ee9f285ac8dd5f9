ARM: davinci: da8xx: add new sata_refclk init using common clock framework

This adds the new SATA REFCLK clock init in mach-davinci/devices-da8xx.c
using the new common clock framework drivers.

The #ifdefs are needed to prevent compile errors until the entire
ARCH_DAVINCI is converted.

Also, the #includes are sorted since we are adding some here.
