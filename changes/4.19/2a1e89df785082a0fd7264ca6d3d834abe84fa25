net: socionext: clear rx irq correctly

commit 63ae7949e94a ("net: socionext: Use descriptor info instead of MMIO reads on Rx")
removed constant mmio reads from the driver and started using a descriptor
field to check if packet should be processed.
This lead the napi rx handler being constantly called while no packets
needed processing and ksoftirq getting 100% cpu usage. Issue one mmio read
to clear the irq correcty after processing packets
