scsi: target: Simplify transport_generic_free_cmd() (2/2)

Since target_wait_free_cmd() skips TMFs with no associated LUN, it is safe
to call that function for such commands. Use this to simplify
transport_generic_free_cmd(). The only functional change in this patch is
that CMD_T_FABRIC_STOP gets set for TMFs with no associated LUN by
transport_generic_free_cmd().
