dt-bindings: arm: ti: Add bindings for AM654 SoC

The AM654 SoC is a lead device of the K3 Multicore SoC architecture
platform, targeted for broad market and industrial control with aim to
meet the complex processing needs of modern embedded products.

Some highlights of this SoC are:
* Quad ARMv8 A53 cores split over two clusters
* GICv3 compliant GIC500
* Configurable L3 Cache and IO-coherent architecture
* Dual lock-step capable R5F uC for safety-critical applications
* High data throughput capable distributed DMA architecture under NAVSS
* Three Gigabit Industrial Communication Subsystems (ICSSG), each with dual
  PRUs and dual RTUs
* Hardware accelerator block containing AES/DES/SHA/MD5 called SA2UL
* Centralized System Controller for Security, Power, and Resource
  management.
* Dual ADCSS, eQEP/eCAP, eHRPWM, dual CAN-FD
* Flash subsystem with OSPI and Hyperbus interfaces
* Multimedia capability with CAL, DSS7-UL, SGX544, McASP
* Peripheral connectivity including USB3, PCIE, MMC/SD, GPMC, I2C, SPI,
  GPIO
