reiserfs: change j_timestamp type to time64_t

This uses the deprecated time_t type but is write-only, and could be
removed, but as Jeff explains, having a timestamp can be usefule for
post-mortem analysis in crash dumps.

In order to remove one of the last instances of time_t, this changes the
type to time64_t, same as j_trans_start_time.
