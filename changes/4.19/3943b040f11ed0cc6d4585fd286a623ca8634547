bcache: release dc->writeback_lock properly in bch_writeback_thread()

The writeback thread would exit with a lock held when the cache device
is detached via sysfs interface, fix it by releasing the held lock
before exiting the while-loop.

Fixes: fadd94e05c02 (bcache: quit dc->writeback_thread when BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is set)
