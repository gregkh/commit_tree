Input: elan_i2c_smbus - cast sizeof to int for comparison

Comparing an int to a size, which is unsigned, causes the int to become
unsigned, giving the wrong result.  i2c_smbus_read_block_data can return the
result of i2c_smbus_xfer, whih can return a negative error code.

A simplified version of the semantic match that finds this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
int x;
expression e,e1;
identifier f;
@@

*x = f(...);
... when != x = e1
    when != if (x < 0 || ...) { ... return ...; }
*x < sizeof(e)
// </smpl>
