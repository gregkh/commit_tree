Drivers: hv: vmbus: Cleanup synic memory free path

clk_evt memory is not being freed when the synic is shutdown
or when there is an allocation error.  Add the appropriate
kfree() call, along with a comment to clarify how the memory
gets freed after an allocation error.  Make the free path
consistent by removing checks for NULL since kfree() and
free_page() already do the check.
