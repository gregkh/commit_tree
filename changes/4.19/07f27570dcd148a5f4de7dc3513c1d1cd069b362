rcu: Improve rcu_note_voluntary_context_switch() reporting

We expect a quiescent state of TASKS_RCU when cond_resched_tasks_rcu_qs()
is called, no matter whether it actually be scheduled or not. However,
it currently doesn't report the quiescent state when the task enters
into __schedule() as it's called with preempt = true. So make it report
the quiescent state unconditionally when cond_resched_tasks_rcu_qs() is
called.

And in TINY_RCU, even though the quiescent state of rcu_bh also should
be reported when the tick interrupt comes from user, it doesn't. So make
it reported.

Lastly in TREE_RCU, rcu_note_voluntary_context_switch() should be
reported when the tick interrupt comes from not only user but also idle,
as an extended quiescent state.
