devlink: Add support for region snapshot read command

Add support for DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_READ_GET used for both reading
and dumping region data. Read allows reading from a region specific
address for given length. Dump allows reading the full region.
If only snapshot ID is provided a snapshot dump will be done.
If snapshot ID, Address and Length are provided a snapshot read
will done.

This is used for both snapshot access and will be used in the same
way to access current data on the region.
