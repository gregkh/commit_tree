atomics/treewide: Make conditional inc/dec ops optional

The conditional inc/dec ops differ for atomic_t and atomic64_t:

- atomic_inc_unless_positive() is optional for atomic_t, and doesn't exist for atomic64_t.
- atomic_dec_unless_negative() is optional for atomic_t, and doesn't exist for atomic64_t.
- atomic_dec_if_positive is optional for atomic_t, and is mandatory for atomic64_t.

Let's make these consistently optional for both. At the same time, let's
clean up the existing fallbacks to use atomic_try_cmpxchg().

The instrumented atomics are updated accordingly.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
