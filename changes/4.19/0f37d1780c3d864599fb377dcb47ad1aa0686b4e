xfs: pass transaction to xfs_defer_add()

The majority of remaining references to struct xfs_defer_ops in XFS
are associated with xfs_defer_add(). At this point, there are no
more external xfs_defer_ops users left. All instances of
xfs_defer_ops are embedded in the transaction, which means we can
safely pass the transaction down to the dfops add interface.

Update xfs_defer_add() to receive the transaction as a parameter.
Various subsystems implement wrappers to allocate and construct the
context specific data structures for the associated deferred
operation type. Update these to also carry the transaction down as
needed and clean up unused dfops parameters along the way.

This removes most of the remaining references to struct
xfs_defer_ops throughout the code and facilitates removal of the
structure.
