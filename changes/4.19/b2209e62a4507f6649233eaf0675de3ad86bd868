drm/i915/execlists: Reset the CSB head tracking on reset/sanitization

We can avoid the mmio read of the CSB pointers after reset based on the
knowledge that the HW always start writing at entry 0 in the CSB buffer.
We need to reset our CSB head tracking after GPU reset (and on
sanitization after resume) so that we are expecting to read from entry
0, hence we reset our head tracking back to the entry before (the last
entry in the ring).
