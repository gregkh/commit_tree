nvmet: support configuring ANA groups

Allow creating non-default ANA groups (group ID > 1).  Groups are created
either by assigning the group ID to a namespace, or by creating a configfs
group object under a specific port.  All namespaces assigned to a group
that doesn't have a configfs object for a given port are marked as
inaccessible.

Allow changing the ANA state on a per-port basis by creating an
ana_groups directory under each port, and another directory with an
ana_state file in it.  The default ANA group 1 directory is created
automatically for each port.

For all changes in ANA configuration the ANA change AEN is sent.  We only
keep a global changecount instead of additional per-group changecounts to
keep the implementation as simple as possible.
