of: fix phandle cache creation for DTs with no phandles

With commit 0b3ce78e90fc ("of: cache phandle nodes to reduce cost of
of_find_node_by_phandle()"), a G3 PowerMac fails to boot. The root cause
is the DT for this system has no phandle properties when booted with
BootX. of_populate_phandle_cache() does not handle the case of no
phandles correctly. The problem is roundup_pow_of_two() for 0 is
undefined. The implementation subtracts 1 underflowing and then things
are in the weeds.
