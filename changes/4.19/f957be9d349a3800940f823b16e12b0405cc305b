netfilter: conntrack: remove ctnetlink callbacks from l3 protocol trackers

handle everything from ctnetlink directly.

After all these years we still only support ipv4 and ipv6, so it
seems reasonable to remove l3 protocol tracker support and instead
handle ipv4/ipv6 from a common, always builtin inet tracker.

Step 1: Get rid of all the l3proto->func() calls.

Start with ctnetlink, then move on to packet-path ones.
