x86/cpufeatures: Add detection of L1D cache flush support.

336996-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channel-Mitigations.pdf defines a new MSR
(IA32_FLUSH_CMD) which is detected by CPUID.7.EDX[28]=1 bit being set.

This new MSR "gives software a way to invalidate structures with finer
granularity than other architectual methods like WBINVD."
