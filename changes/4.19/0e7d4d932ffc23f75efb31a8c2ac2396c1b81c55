crypto: sharah - Unregister correct algorithms for SAHARA 3

This patch fixes two typos related to unregistering algorithms supported by
SAHARAH 3. In sahara_register_algs the wrong algorithms are unregistered
in case of an error. In sahara_unregister_algs the wrong array is used to
determine the iteration count.
