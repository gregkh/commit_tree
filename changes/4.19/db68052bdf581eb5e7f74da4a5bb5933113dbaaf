wlcore: Fix timout errors after recovery

After enabling runtime PM, if we force hardware reset multiple times with:

# echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/wlcore/start_recovery

We will after few tries get the following error:

wlcore: ERROR timeout waiting for the hardware to complete initialization

And then wlcore is unable to reconnect until after the wlcore related modules
are reloaded.

Let's fix this by moving pm_runtime_put() earlier before we restart the hardware.
And let's use the sync version to make sure we're done before we restart.

Note that we still will get -EBUSY warning from wl12xx_sdio_set_power() but let's
fix that separately once we know exactly why we get the warning.
