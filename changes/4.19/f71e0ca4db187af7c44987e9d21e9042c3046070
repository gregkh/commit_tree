net: sched: Avoid implicit chain 0 creation

Currently, chain 0 is implicitly created during block creation. However
that does not align with chain object exposure, creation and destruction
api introduced later on. So make the chain 0 behave the same way as any
other chain and only create it when it is needed. Since chain 0 is
somehow special as the qdiscs need to hold pointer to the first chain
tp, this requires to move the chain head change callback infra to the
block structure.
