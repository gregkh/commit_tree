drm/i915/dsi: rename the current DSI files based on first platform

Starting from ICL or gen 11 we have a new DSI block which requires
completely different programming from the current implementation. Having
them in the same file would be confusing. Rename the current DSI and DSI
PLL implementation files as vlv_dsi.c and vlv_dsi_pll.c.

No functional changes.

v2: use "gen7" prefix.

v3: use "vlv" prefix.
