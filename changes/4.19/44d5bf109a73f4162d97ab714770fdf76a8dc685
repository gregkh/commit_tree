ovl: Copy up only metadata during copy up where it makes sense

If it makes sense to copy up only metadata during copy up, do it.  This is
done for regular files which are not opened for WRITE.

Right now ->metacopy is set to 0 always.  Last patch in the series will
remove the hard coded statement and enable metacopy feature.
