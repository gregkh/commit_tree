ARM: spectre-v1: use get_user() for __get_user()

Fixing __get_user() for spectre variant 1 is not sane: we would have to
add address space bounds checking in order to validate that the location
should be accessed, and then zero the address if found to be invalid.

Since __get_user() is supposed to avoid the bounds check, and this is
exactly what get_user() does, there's no point having two different
implementations that are doing the same thing.  So, when the Spectre
workarounds are required, make __get_user() an alias of get_user().
