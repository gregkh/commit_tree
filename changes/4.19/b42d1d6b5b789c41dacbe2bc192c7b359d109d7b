jbd2: replace current_kernel_time64 with ktime equivalent

jbd2 is one of the few callers of current_kernel_time64(), which
is a wrapper around ktime_get_coarse_real_ts64(). This calls the
latter directly for consistency with the rest of the kernel that
is moving to the ktime_get_ family of time accessors.
