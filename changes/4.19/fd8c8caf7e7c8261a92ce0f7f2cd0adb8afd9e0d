f2fs: let checkpoint flush dnode page of regular

Fsyncer will wait on all dnode pages of regular writeback before flushing,
if there are async dnode pages blocked by IO scheduler, it may decrease
fsync's performance.

In this patch, we choose to let f2fs_balance_fs_bg() to trigger checkpoint
to flush these dnode pages of regular, so async IO of dnode page can be
elimitnated, making fsyncer only need to wait for sync IO.
