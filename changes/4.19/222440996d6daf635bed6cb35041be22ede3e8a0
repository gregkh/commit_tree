net/af_iucv: drop inbound packets with invalid flags

Inbound packets may have any combination of flag bits set in their iucv
header. If we don't know how to handle a specific combination, drop the
skb instead of leaking it.

To clarify what error is returned in this case, replace the hard-coded
0 with the corresponding macro.
