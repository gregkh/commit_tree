s390: ebcdic: convert comments to UTF-8

The ebcdic.c file contains tables for converting between ebcdic and PC
codepage 437.  I could however not identify which encoding was used for
the comments.  This seems to be some variation of ISO_8859-1 with
non-UTF-8 escape characters.

I have converted this to UTF-8 by manually removing the escape
characters and then running it through recode, to get the same encoding
that we use for the rest of the kernel.
