console: Replace #if 0 with atomic var 'ignore_console_lock_warning'

The macro WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED prints a warning when a thread enters
the console's critical section without having acquired the console
lock. The console lock can be ignored when debugging the console using
printk, but this makes WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED generate unnecessary
warnings.

The variable ignore_console_lock_warning temporarily disables
WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED. Developers interested in debugging the console's
critical sections should increment it before entering the CS and
decrement it after leaving the CS. Setting ignore_console_lock_warning
is only for debugging. Regular operation should not manipulate it.

Acknoledgements: This patch is based on an earlier version by Steven
Rostedt. The use of atomic increment/decrement was suggested by Petr
Mladek.
