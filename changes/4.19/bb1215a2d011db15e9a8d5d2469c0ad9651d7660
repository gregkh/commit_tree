ide: remove redundant variables queue_run_ms and left

Variable queue_run_ms is not being used and is redundant and hence can
be removed. Removing this also means that variable left can also be
removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
warning: variable ‘queue_run_ms’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
