asm-generic: io: Fix ioport_map() for !CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP && CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO

The !CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP version of ioport_map uses MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT to
prevent users from making I/O accesses outside the expected I/O range -
however it erroneously treats MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT as a mask which is
contradictory to its other users.

The introduction of CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO, which subtracts an arbitrary
amount from IO_SPACE_LIMIT to form MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT, results in ioport_map
mangling the given port rather than capping it.

We address this by aligning more closely with the CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP
implementation of ioport_map by using the comparison operator and
returning NULL where the port exceeds MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT. Though note that
we preserve the existing behavior of masking with IO_SPACE_LIMIT such that
we don't break existing buggy drivers that somehow rely on this masking.
