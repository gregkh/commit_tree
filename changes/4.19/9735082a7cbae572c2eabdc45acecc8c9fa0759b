Input: xpad - add support for Xbox1 PDP Camo series gamepad

The "Xbox One PDP Wired Controller - Camo series" has a different
product-id than the regular PDP controller and the PDP stealth series,
but it uses the same initialization sequence. This patch adds the
product-id of the camo series to the structures that handle the other
PDP Xbox One controllers.
