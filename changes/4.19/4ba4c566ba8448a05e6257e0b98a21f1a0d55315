net/ipv6: Fix index counter for unicast addresses in in6_dump_addrs

The loop wants to skip previously dumped addresses, so loops until
current index >= saved index. If the message fills it wants to save
the index for the next address to dump - ie., the one that did not
fit in the current message.

Currently, it is incrementing the index counter before comparing to the
saved index, and then the saved index is off by 1 - it assumes the
current address is going to fit in the message.

Change the index handling to increment only after a succesful dump.
