bpf: btf: add pretty print for hash/lru_hash maps

Commit a26ca7c982cb ("bpf: btf: Add pretty print support to
the basic arraymap") added pretty print support to array map.
This patch adds pretty print for hash and lru_hash maps.
The following example shows the pretty-print result of
a pinned hashmap:

    struct map_value {
            int count_a;
            int count_b;
    };

    cat /sys/fs/bpf/pinned_hash_map:

    87907: {87907,87908}
    57354: {37354,57355}
    76625: {76625,76626}
    ...
