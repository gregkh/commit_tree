drm/omap: Implement workaround for DRA7 errata ID:i932

Description of DRA7 Errata i932:

In rare circumstances DPLL_VIDEO1 and DPLL_VIDEO2 PLL's may not lock on
the first attempt during DSS initialization. When this occurs, a
subsequent attempt to relock the PLL will result in PLL successfully
locking.

This patch does the following as per the errata recommendation:

- retries locking the PLL upto 20 times.

- The time to wait for a PLL lock set to 1000 REFCLK cycles. We use
usleep_range to wait for 1000 REFCLK cycles in the us range. This tight
constraint is imposed as a lock later than 1000 REFCLK cycles may have
high jitter.

- Criteria for PLL lock is extended from check on just the PLL_LOCK bit
to check on 6 PLL_STATUS bits.

Silicon Versions Impacted:
DRA71, DRA72, DRA74, DRA76 - All silicon revisions
AM57x - All silicon revisions

OMAP4/5 are not impacted by this errata
