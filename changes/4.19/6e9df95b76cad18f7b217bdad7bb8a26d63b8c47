livepatch: Validate module/old func name length

livepatch module author can pass module name/old function name with more
than the defined character limit. With obj->name length greater than
MODULE_NAME_LEN, the livepatch module gets loaded but waits forever on
the module specified by obj->name to be loaded. It also populates a /sys
directory with an untruncated object name.

In the case of funcs->old_name length greater then KSYM_NAME_LEN, it
would not match against any of the symbol table entries. Instead loop
through the symbol table comparing them against a nonexisting function,
which can be avoided.

The same issues apply, to misspelled/incorrect names. At least gatekeep
the modules with over the limit string length, by checking for their
length during livepatch module registration.
