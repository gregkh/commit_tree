bitmap: Add bitmap_alloc(), bitmap_zalloc() and bitmap_free()

A lot of code become ugly because of open coding allocations for bitmaps.

Introduce three helpers to allow users be more clear of intention
and keep their code neat.

Note, due to multiple circular dependencies we may not provide
the helpers as inliners. For now we keep them exported and, perhaps,
at some point in the future we will sort out header inclusion and
inheritance.
