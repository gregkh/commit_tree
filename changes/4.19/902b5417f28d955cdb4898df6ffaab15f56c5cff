selftests: pmtu: maximum MTU for vti4 is 2^16-1-20

Since commit 82612de1c98e ("ip_tunnel: restore binding to ifaces with a
large mtu"), the maximum MTU for vti4 is based on IP_MAX_MTU instead of
the mysterious constant 0xFFF8.  This makes this selftest fail.

Fixes: 82612de1c98e ("ip_tunnel: restore binding to ifaces with a large mtu")
