drm: add missing ctx argument to plane transitional helpers

In commits:
34a2ab5e0689 ("drm: Add acquire ctx parameter to ->update_plane")
1931529448bc ("drm: Add acquire ctx parameter to ->plane_disable")

a pointer to a drm_modeset_acquire_ctx structure was added as an
argument to the method prototypes.  The transitional helpers are
supposed to be directly plugged in as implementations of these
methods, but doing so generates a warning.  Add the missing
argument.

A number of buggy users were added for drm_plane_helper_disable()
which need to be fixed up for this change, which we do by passing
a NULL ctx argument.
