x86/intel_rdt: Fix invalid mode warning when multiple resources are managed

When multiple resources are managed by RDT, the number of CLOSIDs used
is the minimum of the CLOSIDs supported by each resource. In the function
rdt_bit_usage_show(), the annotated bitmask is created to depict how the
CAT supporting caches are being used. During this annotated bitmask
creation, each resource group is queried for its mode that is used as a
label in the annotated bitmask.

The maximum number of resource groups is currently assumed to be the
number of CLOSIDs supported by the resource for which the information is
being displayed. This is incorrect since the number of active CLOSIDs is
the minimum across all resources.

If information for a cache instance with more CLOSIDs than another is
being generated we thus encounter a warning like:

invalid mode for closid 8
WARNING: CPU: 88 PID: 1791 at [SNIP]/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_rdt_rdtgroup.c
:827 rdt_bit_usage_show+0x221/0x2b0

Fix this by ensuring that only the number of supported CLOSIDs are
considered.
