drm/i915: Stop parking the signaler around reset

We cannot call kthread_park() from softirq context, so let's avoid it
entirely during the reset. We wanted to suspend the signaler so that it
would not mark a request as complete at the same time as we marked it as
being in error. Instead of parking the signaling, stop the engine from
advancing so that the GPU doesn't emit the breadcrumb for our chosen
"guilty" request.

v2: Refactor setting STOP_RING so that we don't have the same code thrice
