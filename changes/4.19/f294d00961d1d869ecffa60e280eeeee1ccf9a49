misc: sram: fix resource leaks in probe error path

Make sure to disable clocks and deregister any exported partitions
before returning on late probe errors.

Note that since commit ee895ccdf776 ("misc: sram: fix enabled clock leak
on error path"), partitions are deliberately exported before enabling
the clock so we stick to that logic here. A follow up patch will address
this.
