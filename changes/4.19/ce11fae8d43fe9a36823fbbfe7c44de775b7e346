rcu: Use the proper lockdep annotation in dump_blkd_tasks()

Sparse reported this:

| kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:814:9: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different modifiers)
| kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:814:9:    expected struct lockdep_map const *lock
| kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:814:9:    got struct lockdep_map [noderef] *<noident>

This is caused by using vanilla lockdep annotations on rcu_node::lock,
and that requires accessing ->lock of rcu_node directly. However we need
to keep rcu_node::lock __private to avoid breaking its extra ordering
guarantee. And we have a dedicated lockdep annotation for
rcu_node::lock, so use it.
