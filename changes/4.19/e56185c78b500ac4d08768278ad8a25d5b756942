net: sched: add tcf_proto_op to offload a rule

Create a new tcf_proto_op called 'reoffload' that generates a new offload
message for each node in a tcf_proto. Pointers to the tcf_proto and
whether the offload request is to add or delete the node are included.
Also included is a callback function to send the offload message to and
the option of priv data to go with the cb.
