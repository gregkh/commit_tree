KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Let userspace opt-in to writable v2 IGROUPR

Simply letting IGROUPR be writable from userspace would break
migration from old kernels to newer kernels, because old kernels
incorrectly report interrupt groups as group 1.  This would not be a big
problem if userspace wrote GICD_IIDR as read from the kernel, because we
could detect the incompatibility and return an error to userspace.
Unfortunately, this is not the case with current userspace
implementations and simply letting IGROUPR be writable from userspace for
an emulated GICv2 silently breaks migration and causes the destination
VM to no longer run after migration.

We now encourage userspace to write the read and expected value of
GICD_IIDR as the first part of a GIC register restore, and if we observe
a write to GICD_IIDR we know that userspace has been updated and has had
a chance to cope with older kernels (VGICv2 IIDR.Revision == 0)
incorrectly reporting interrupts as group 1, and therefore we now allow
groups to be user writable.
