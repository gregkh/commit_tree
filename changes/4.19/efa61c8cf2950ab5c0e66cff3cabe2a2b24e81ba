ptp: fix Spectre v1 vulnerability

pin_index can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading
to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

drivers/ptp/ptp_chardev.c:253 ptp_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue
'ops->pin_config' [r] (local cap)

Fix this by sanitizing pin_index before using it to index
ops->pin_config, and before passing it as an argument to
function ptp_set_pinfunc(), in which it is used to index
info->pin_config.

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
