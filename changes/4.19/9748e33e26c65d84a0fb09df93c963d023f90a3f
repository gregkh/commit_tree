mips: mm: Create UCA-based ioremap_wc() method

Modern MIPS cores (like P5600/6600, M5150/6520, end so on) which
got L2-cache on chip also can enable a special type Cache-Coherency
attribute (CCA) named UnCached Accelerated attribute (UCA). In this
way uncached accelerated accesses are treated the same way as
non-accelerated uncached accesses, but uncached stores are gathered
together for more efficient bus utilization. So to speak this CCA
enables uncached transactions to better utilize bus bandwidth via
burst transactions.

This is exactly why ioremap_wc() method has been introduced in Linux.
Alas MIPS-platform code hasn't implemented it so far, instead default
one has been used which was an alias to ioremap_nocache. In order to
fix this we added MIPS-specific ioremap_wc() macro substituted by
generic __ioremap_mode() method call with writecombine CPU-info
field passed. It shall create real ioremap_wc() method if CPU-cache
supports UCA feature and fall-back to _CACHE_UNCACHED attribute
if one doesn't. Additionally platform-specific io.h shall declare
ARCH_HAS_IOREMAP_WC macro as indication of architectural definition
of ioremap_wc() (similar to x86/powerpc).
