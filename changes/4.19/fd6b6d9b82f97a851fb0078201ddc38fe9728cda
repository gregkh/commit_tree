KVM: VMX: check for existence of secondary exec controls before accessing

Return early from vmx_set_virtual_apic_mode() if the processor doesn't
support VIRTUALIZE_APIC_ACCESSES or VIRTUALIZE_X2APIC_MODE, both of
which reside in SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL.  This eliminates warnings
due to VMWRITEs to SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL (VMCS field 401e) failing
on processors without secondary exec controls.

Remove the similar check for TPR shadowing as it is incorporated in the
flexpriority_enabled check and the APIC-related code in
vmx_update_msr_bitmap() is further gated by VIRTUALIZE_X2APIC_MODE.
