ip: use rb trees for IP frag queue.

Similar to TCP OOO RX queue, it makes sense to use rb trees to store
IP fragments, so that OOO fragments are inserted faster.

Tested:

- a follow-up patch contains a rather comprehensive ip defrag
  self-test (functional)
- ran neper `udp_stream -c -H <host> -F 100 -l 300 -T 20`:
    netstat --statistics
    Ip:
        282078937 total packets received
        0 forwarded
        0 incoming packets discarded
        946760 incoming packets delivered
        18743456 requests sent out
        101 fragments dropped after timeout
        282077129 reassemblies required
        944952 packets reassembled ok
        262734239 packet reassembles failed
   (The numbers/stats above are somewhat better re:
    reassemblies vs a kernel without this patchset. More
    comprehensive performance testing TBD).
