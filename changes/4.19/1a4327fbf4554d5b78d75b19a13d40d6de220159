spi: fix IDR collision on systems with both fixed and dynamic SPI bus numbers

On systems where some controllers get a dynamic ID assigned and some have
a fixed number (e.g. from ACPI tables), the current implementation might
run into an IDR collision: in case of a fixed bus number is gotten by a
driver (but not marked busy in IDR tree) and a driver with dynamic bus
number gets the same ID and predictably fails.

Fix this by means of checking-in fixed IDsin IDR as far as dynamic ones
at the moment of the controller registration.
