vmw_balloon: do not use 2MB without batching

If the hypervisor sets 2MB batching is on, while batching is cleared,
the balloon code breaks. In this case the legacy mechanism is used with
2MB page. The VM would report a 2MB page is ballooned, and the
hypervisor would only take the first 4KB.

While the hypervisor should not report such settings, make the code more
robust by not enabling 2MB support without batching.
