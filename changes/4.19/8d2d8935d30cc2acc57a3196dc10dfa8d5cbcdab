mei: ignore not found client in the enumeration

Some of the ME clients are available only for BIOS operation and are
removed during hand off to an OS. However the removal is not instant.
A client may be visible on the client list when the mei driver requests
for enumeration, while the subsequent request for properties will be
answered with client not found error value. The default behavior
for an error is to perform client reset while this error is harmless and
the link reset should be prevented. This issue started to be visible due to
suspend/resume timing changes. Currently reported only on the Haswell
based system.
