sparc: Fix single-pcr perf event counter management.

It is important to clear the hw->state value for non-stopped events
when they are added into the PMU.  Otherwise when the event is
scheduled out, we won't read the counter because HES_UPTODATE is still
set.  This breaks 'perf stat' and similar use cases, causing all the
events to show zero.

This worked for multi-pcr because we make explicit sparc_pmu_start()
calls in calculate_multiple_pcrs().  calculate_single_pcr() doesn't do
this because the idea there is to accumulate all of the counter
settings into the single pcr value.  So we have to add explicit
hw->state handling there.

Like x86, we use the PERF_HES_ARCH bit to track truly stopped events
so that we don't accidently start them on a reload.

Related to all of this, sparc_pmu_start() is missing a userpage update
so add it.
