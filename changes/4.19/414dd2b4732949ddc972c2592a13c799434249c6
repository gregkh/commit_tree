x86/intel_rdt: Introduce new "exclusive" mode

At the moment all allocations are shareable. There is no way for a user to
designate that an allocation associated with a resource group cannot be
shared by another.

Introduce the new mode "exclusive". When a resource group is marked as such
it implies that no overlap is allowed between its allocation and that of
another resource group.
