s390/kdump: Fix memleak in nt_vmcoreinfo

The vmcoreinfo of a crashed system is potentially fragmented. Thus the
crash kernel has an intermediate step where the vmcoreinfo is copied into a
temporary, continuous buffer in the crash kernel memory. This temporary
buffer is never freed. Free it now to prevent the memleak.

While at it replace all occurrences of "VMCOREINFO" by its corresponding
macro to prevent potential renaming issues.
