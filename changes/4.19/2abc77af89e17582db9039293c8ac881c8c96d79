new helper: open_with_fake_path()

open a file by given inode, faking ->f_path.  Use with shitloads
of caution - at the very least you'd damn better make sure that
some dentry alias of that inode is pinned down by the path in
question.  Again, this is no general-purpose interface and I hope
it will eventually go away.  Right now overlayfs wants something
like that, but nothing else should.

Any out-of-tree code with bright idea of using this one *will*
eventually get hurt, with zero notice and great delight on my part.
I refuse to use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), especially in situations when
it's really EXPORT_SYMBOL_DONT_USE_IT(), but don't take that export
as "you are welcome to use it".
