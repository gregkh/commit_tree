s390/mm: Abstract gmap notify bit setting

Currently we use the software PGSTE bits PGSTE_IN_BIT and
PGSTE_VSIE_BIT to notify before an invalidation occurs on a prefix
page or a VSIE page respectively. Both bits are pgste specific, but
are used when protecting a memory range.

Let's introduce abstract GMAP_NOTIFY_* bits that will be realized into
the respective bits when gmap DAT table entries are protected.
