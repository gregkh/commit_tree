sched/numa: Migrate pages to local nodes quicker early in the lifetime of a task

Automatic NUMA Balancing uses a multi-stage pass to decide whether a page
should migrate to a local node. This filter avoids excessive ping-ponging
if a page is shared or used by threads that migrate cross-node frequently.

Threads inherit both page tables and the preferred node ID from the
parent. This means that threads can trigger hinting faults earlier than
a new task which delays scanning for a number of seconds. As it can be
load balanced very early in its lifetime there can be an unnecessary delay
before it starts migrating thread-local data. This patch migrates private
pages faster early in the lifetime of a thread using the sequence counter
as an identifier of new tasks.

With this patch applied, STREAM performance is the same as 4.17 even though
processes are not spread cross-node prematurely. Other workloads showed
a mix of minor gains and losses. This is somewhat expected most workloads
are not very sensitive to the starting conditions of a process.
