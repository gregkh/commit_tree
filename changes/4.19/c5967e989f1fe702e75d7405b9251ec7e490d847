checkpatch: add __ro_after_init to known $Attribute

__ro_after_init is a specific __attribute__ that checkpatch does currently
not understand.

Add it to the known $Attribute types so that code that uses variables
declared with __ro_after_init are not thought to be a modifier type.

This appears as a defect in checkpatch output of code like:

static bool trust_cpu __ro_after_init = IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU);
[...]
       if (trust_cpu && arch_init) {

where checkpatch reports:

ERROR: space prohibited after that '&&' (ctx:WxW)
	if (trust_cpu && arch_init) {
