net: ipv4: Control SKB reprioritization after forwarding

After IPv4 packets are forwarded, the priority of the corresponding SKB
is updated according to the TOS field of IPv4 header. This overrides any
prioritization done earlier by e.g. an skbedit action or ingress-qos-map
defined at a vlan device.

Such overriding may not always be desirable. Even if the packet ends up
being routed, which implies this is an L3 network node, an administrator
may wish to preserve whatever prioritization was done earlier on in the
pipeline.

Therefore introduce a sysctl that controls this behavior. Keep the
default value at 1 to maintain backward-compatible behavior.
