perf trace: Allow setting up a syscall_tp struct without a format_field

To avoid having to ask libtraceevent to find a field by name when
handling each tracepoint event, we setup a struct syscall_tp with
a tp_field struct having an extractor function + the offset for the
"id", "args" and "ret" raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} tracepoints.

Now that we want to do the same with syscalls:sys_{entry,exit}_NAME
individual syscall tracepoints, where we have "id" as "__syscall_nr" and
"args" as the actual series of per syscall parameters, we need more
flexibility from the routines that set up these pre-looked up syscall
tracepoint arg fields.

The next cset will use it.
