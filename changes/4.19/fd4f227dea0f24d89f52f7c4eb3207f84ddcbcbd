bpf: offload: allow program and map sharing per-ASIC

Allow programs and maps to be re-used across different netdevs,
as long as they belong to the same struct bpf_offload_dev.
Update the bpf_offload_prog_map_match() helper for the verifier
and export a new helper for the drivers to use when checking
programs at attachment time.
