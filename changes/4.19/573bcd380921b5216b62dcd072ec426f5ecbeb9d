MAINTAINERS: Remove obsolete drivers/pci pattern from ACPI section

Prior to 256a45937093 ("PCI/AER: Squash aerdrv_acpi.c into aerdrv.c"),
drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_acpi.c contained code to parse the ACPI HEST
table.  That code now lives in drivers/pci/pcie/aer.c.

Remove the "F: drivers/pci/*/*/*acpi*" pattern because it matches nothing.

We could add a "F: drivers/pci/pcie/aer.c" pattern to the ACPI APEI
section, but that file sees a lot of changes, almost none of which are of
interest to the ACPI folks.
