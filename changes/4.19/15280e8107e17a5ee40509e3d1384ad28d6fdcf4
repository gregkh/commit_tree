sparc64: add reads{b,w,l}/writes{b,w,l}

Some drivers need these for compile-testing. On most architectures
they come from asm-generic/io.h, but not on sparc64, which has its
own definitions.

Since we already have ioread*_rep()/iowrite*_rep() that have the
same behavior on sparc64 (i.e. all PCI I/O space is memory mapped),
we can rename the existing helpers and add macros to define them
to the same implementation.
