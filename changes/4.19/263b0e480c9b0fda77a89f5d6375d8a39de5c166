s390/kdump: Make elfcorehdr size calculation ABI compliant

There are two ways to pass the vmcoreinfo to the crash kernel 1) via the
os_info mechanism and 2) via the lowcore->vmcore_info field. In the Linux
kernel only the second way is used. However, the first way is ABI for
stand-alone kdump. So other OSes use it to pass additional debug info. Make
the elfcorehdr size calculation aware of both possible ways.
