net/mlx4_core: Add health buffer address capability

Health buffer address is a 32 bit PCI address offset provided by
the FW. This offset is used for reading FW health debug data
located on the shared CR space. Cr space is accessible in both
driver and FW and allows for different queries and configurations.
Health buffer size is always 64B of readable data followed by a
lock which is used to block volatile CR space access.
