iio: ad9523: Fix return value for ad952x_store()

A sysfs write callback function needs to either return the number of
consumed characters or an error.

The ad952x_store() function currently returns 0 if the input value was "0",
this will signal that no characters have been consumed and the function
will be called repeatedly in a loop indefinitely. Fix this by returning
number of supplied characters to indicate that the whole input string has
been consumed.
