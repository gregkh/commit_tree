powerpc/mm: Check memblock_add against MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS range

With SPARSEMEM config enabled, we make sure that we don't add sections beyond
MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS range. This results in not building vmemmap mapping for
range beyond max range. But our memblock layer looks the device tree and create
mapping for the full memory range. Prevent this by checking against
MAX_PHSYSMEM_BITS when doing memblock_add.

We don't do similar check for memeblock_reserve_range. If reserve range is beyond
MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS we expect that to be configured with 'nomap'. Any other
reserved range should come from existing memblock ranges which we already
filtered while adding.

This avoids crash as below when running on a system with system ram config above
MAX_PHSYSMEM_BITS
