linux/compiler.h: don't use bool

Appararently, it's possible to have a non-trivial TU include a few
headers, including linux/build_bug.h, without ending up with
linux/types.h.  So the 0day bot sent me

config: um-x86_64_defconfig (attached as .config)

>> include/linux/compiler.h:316:3: error: unknown type name 'bool'; did you mean '_Bool'?
      bool __cond = !(condition);    \

for something I'm working on.

Rather than contributing to the #include madness and including
linux/types.h from compiler.h, just use int.
