orangefs: Adding new return type vm_fault_t

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler. For now,
this is just documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT
value rather than an errno. Once all instances are converted,
vm_fault_t will become a distinct type.

See the following
commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

Fixed checkpatch.pl warning.
