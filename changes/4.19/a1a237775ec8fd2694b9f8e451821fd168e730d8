sunrpc: Enable the kernel to specify the hostname part of service principals

A multi-homed NFS server may have more than one "nfs" key in its
keytab. Enable the kernel to pick the key it wants as a machine
credential when establishing a GSS context.

This is useful for GSS-protected NFSv4.0 callbacks, which are
required by RFC 7530 S3.3.3 to use the same principal as the service
principal the client used when establishing its lease.

A complementary modification to rpc.gssd is required to fully enable
this feature.
