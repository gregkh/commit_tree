iwlwifi: mvm: configure multi RX queue

Currently multi-queue is disabled for 22000 devices.

This was since driver isn't supposed to write to prph
registers anymore, and FW needs to configure the RFH.

Now that FW added support for the API - use it and remove
the 22000 multi RX queue disablement.

Bump min API version to avoid compatibility issues.
