ocfs2: make several functions and variables static (and some const)

There are a variety of functions and variables that are local to the
source and do not need to be in global scope, so make them static.  Also
make a couple of char arrays static const.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
  symbol 'o2hb_heartbeat_mode_desc' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'o2hb_heartbeat_mode' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'o2hb_dependent_users' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'o2hb_region_dec_user' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'o2nm_fence_method_desc' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'lockdep_keys' was not declared. Should it be static?
