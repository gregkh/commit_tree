block: don't account for split bio's size in cgroup stats

We need to check in blkcg_bio_issue_check if the bio is flagged as
QUEUE_ENTERED, because if it is then we've already accounted for the
size of the IO in the cgroup stats.  We can still however account for
the extra IO since it'll be another request.
