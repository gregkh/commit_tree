ARM: net: bpf: improve 64-bit store implementation

Improve the 64-bit store implementation from:

  ldr     r6, [fp, #-8]
  str     r8, [r6]
  ldr     r6, [fp, #-8]
  mov     r7, #4
  add     r7, r6, r7
  str     r9, [r7]

to:

  ldr     r6, [fp, #-8]
  str     r8, [r6]
  str     r9, [r6, #4]

We leave the store as two separate STR instructions rather than using
STRD as the store may not be aligned, and STR can handle misalignment.
