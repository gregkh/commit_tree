xfs: refactor buffer submission into a common helper

Sync and async buffer submission both do generally similar things
with a couple odd exceptions. Refactor the core buffer submission
code into a common helper to isolate buffer submission from
completion handling of synchronous buffer I/O.

This patch does not change behavior. It is a step towards support
for using synchronous buffer I/O via synchronous delwri queue
submission.
