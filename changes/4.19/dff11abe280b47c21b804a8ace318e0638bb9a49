hugetlb: take PMD sharing into account when flushing tlb/caches

When fixing an issue with PMD sharing and migration, it was discovered via
code inspection that other callers of huge_pmd_unshare potentially have an
issue with cache and tlb flushing.

Use the routine adjust_range_if_pmd_sharing_possible() to calculate worst
case ranges for mmu notifiers.  Ensure that this range is flushed if
huge_pmd_unshare succeeds and unmaps a PUD_SUZE area.
