drm/amdkfd: Change the control stack MTYPE from UC to NC on GFX9

CWSR fails on Raven if the control stack is MTYPE_UC, which is used
for regular GART mappings. As a workaround we map it using MTYPE_NC.

The MEC firmware expects the control stack at one page offset from the
start of the MQD so it is part of the MQD allocation on GFXv9. AMDGPU
added a memory allocation flag just for this purpose.
