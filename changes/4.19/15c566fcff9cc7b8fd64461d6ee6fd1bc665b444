i2c: designware: Add SPDX license tag

Replace short statement in comment with proper SPDX license tag.

Note, for i2c-desingware-slave.c the identifier is chosen
in accordance with MODULE_LICENSE() macro since it is visible to user.
Another point to this choice is that the header seems to be copy'n'paste
from the other file of this very driver.
