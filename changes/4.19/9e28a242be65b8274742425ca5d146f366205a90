xfs: drop unnecessary xfs_defer_finish() dfops parameter

Every caller of xfs_defer_finish() now passes the transaction and
its associated ->t_dfops. The xfs_defer_ops parameter is therefore
no longer necessary and can be removed.

Since most xfs_defer_finish() callers also have to consider
xfs_defer_cancel() on error, update the latter to also receive the
transaction for consistency. The log recovery code contains an
outlier case that cancels a dfops directly without an available
transaction. Retain an internal wrapper to support this outlier case
for the time being.
