fsi/gpio: Use relative-addressing commands

FSI CFAMs support shorter commands that use a relative (or same) address
as the last. This change introduces a last_addr to the master state, and
uses it for subsequent reads/writes, and performs relative addressing
when a subsequent read/write is in range.
