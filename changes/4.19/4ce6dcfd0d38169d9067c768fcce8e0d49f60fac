dt: thermal: tsens: Document the fallback DT property for v2 of TSENS IP

We want to create common code for v2 of the TSENS IP block that is used in
a large number of Qualcomm SoCs. "qcom,tsens-v2" should be able to handle
most of the common functionality start with a common get_temp() function.

It is also necessary to split out the memory regions for the TM and SROT
register banks because their offsets are not constant across SoC families.
