drm/i915: Track the last-active inside the i915_vma

Using a VMA on more than one timeline concurrently is the exception
rather than the rule (using it concurrently on multiple engines). As we
expect to only use one active tracker, store the most recently used
tracker inside the i915_vma itself and only fallback to the rbtree if
we need a second or more concurrent active trackers.

v2: Comments on how we overwrite any existing last_active cache.
v3: __list_del_entry() before list_replace_init() is confusing and, much
more important, entirely redundant.
v4: Note that both last_active and the rbtree may be simultaneously
tracking this timeline, albeit with different requests, and so the vma
may be retired twice for the same timeline.
v5: No, that list_del is required!
