pids: Move the pgrp and session pid pointers from task_struct to signal_struct

To access these fields the code always has to go to group leader so
going to signal struct is no loss and is actually a fundamental simplification.

This saves a little bit of memory by only allocating the pid pointer array
once instead of once for every thread, and even better this removes a
few potential races caused by the fact that group_leader can be changed
by de_thread, while signal_struct can not.
