mmc: block: Fix unsupported parallel dispatch of requests

The mmc block driver does not support parallel dispatch of requests. In
normal circumstances, all requests are anyway funneled through a single
work item, so parallel dispatch never happens. However it can happen if
there is no elevator.

Fix that by detecting if a dispatch is in progress and returning busy
(BLK_STS_RESOURCE) in that case
