RDMA/uverbs: Simplify UVERBS_ATTR family of macros

Instead of using a complex cascade of macros, just directly provide the
initializer list each of the declarations is trying to create.

Now that the macros are simplified this also reworks the uverbs_attr_spec
to be friendly to older compilers by eliminating any unnamed
structures/unions inside, and removing the duplication of some fields. The
structure size remains at 16 bytes which was the original motivation for
some of this oddness.
