x86/boot: Fix kexec booting failure in the SEV bit detection code

Commit

  1958b5fc4010 ("x86/boot: Add early boot support when running with SEV active")

can occasionally cause system resets when kexec-ing a second kernel even
if SEV is not active.

That's because get_sev_encryption_bit() uses 32-bit rIP-relative
addressing to read the value of enc_bit - a variable which caches a
previously detected encryption bit position - but kexec may allocate
the early boot code to a higher location, beyond the 32-bit addressing
limit.

In this case, garbage will be read and get_sev_encryption_bit() will
return the wrong value, leading to accessing memory with the wrong
encryption setting.

Therefore, remove enc_bit, and thus get rid of the need to do 32-bit
rIP-relative addressing in the first place.
