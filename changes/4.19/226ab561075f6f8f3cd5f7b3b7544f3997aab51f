device-dax: Convert to vmf_insert_mixed and vm_fault_t

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault and huge_fault handler. For
now, this is just documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT value
rather than an errno.  Once all instances are converted, vm_fault_t will
become a distinct type.

Commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

Previously vm_insert_mixed() returned an error code which driver mapped into
VM_FAULT_* type. The new function vmf_insert_mixed() will replace this
inefficiency by returning VM_FAULT_* type.
