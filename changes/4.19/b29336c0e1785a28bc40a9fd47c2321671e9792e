powerpc/powernv/opal-dump : Use IRQ_HANDLED instead of numbers in interrupt handler

Fixes: 8034f715f ("powernv/opal-dump: Convert to irq domain")

Converts all the return explicit number to a more proper IRQ_HANDLED,
which looks proper incase of interrupt handler returning case.

Here, It also removes error message like "nobody cared" which was
getting unveiled while returning -1 or 0 from handler.
