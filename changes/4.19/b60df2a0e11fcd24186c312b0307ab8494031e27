tools: libbpf: expose the prog type guessing from section name logic

libbpf can guess program type based on ELF section names.  As libbpf
becomes more popular its association between section name strings and
types becomes more of a standard.  Allow libbpf users to use the same
logic for matching strings to types, e.g. when the string originates
from command line.
