mtdchar: fix overflows in adjustment of `count`

The first checks in mtdchar_read() and mtdchar_write() attempt to limit
`count` such that `*ppos + count <= mtd->size`. However, they ignore the
possibility of `*ppos > mtd->size`, allowing the calculation of `count` to
wrap around. `mtdchar_lseek()` prevents seeking beyond mtd->size, but the
pread/pwrite syscalls bypass this.

I haven't found any codepath on which this actually causes dangerous
behavior, but it seems like a sensible change anyway.
