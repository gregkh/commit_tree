cpufreq: pcc-cpufreq: Disable dynamic scaling on many-CPU systems

The firmware interface used by the pcc-cpufreq driver is
fundamentally not scalable and using it for dynamic CPU performance
scaling on systems with many CPUs leads to degraded performance.

For this reason, disable dynamic CPU performance scaling on systems
with pcc-cpufreq where the number of CPUs present at the driver init
time is greater than 4.  Also make the driver print corresponding
complaints to the kernel log.
