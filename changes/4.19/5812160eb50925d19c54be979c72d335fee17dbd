Revert "Revert "ovl: get_write_access() in truncate""

This reverts commit 31c3a7069593b072bd57192b63b62f9a7e994e9a.

Re-add functionality dealing with i_writecount on truncate to overlayfs.
This patch shouldn't have any observable effects, since we just re-assert
the writecout that vfs_truncate() already got for us.

This is in preparation for moving overlay functionality out of the VFS.
