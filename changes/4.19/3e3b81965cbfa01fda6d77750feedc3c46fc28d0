usb: typec: mux: Take care of driver module reference counting

Functions typec_mux_get() and typec_switch_get() already
make sure that the mux device reference count is
incremented, but the same must be done to the driver module
as well to prevent the drivers from being unloaded in the
middle of operation.

This fixes a potential "BUG: unable to handle kernel paging
request at ..." from happening.
