PCI: aardvark: Remove PCIe outbound window configuration

Outbound window is used to translate CPU space addresses to PCIe space
addresses when the CPU initiates PCIe transactions.

According to the suggestion of the HW designers, the recommended
solution is to use the default outbound parameters, even though the
current outbound window setting does not cause any known functional
issue.

This patch doesn't address any known functional issue, but aligns to
HW design guidelines, and removes code that isn't needed.
