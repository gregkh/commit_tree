bus: add bus driver for accessing Allwinner A64 DE2

The "Display Engine 2.0" (usually called DE2) on the Allwinner A64 SoC
is different from the ones on other Allwinner SoCs. It requires a SRAM
region to be claimed, otherwise all DE2 subblocks won't be accessible.

Add a bus driver for the Allwinner A64 DE2 part which claims the SRAM
region when probing.
