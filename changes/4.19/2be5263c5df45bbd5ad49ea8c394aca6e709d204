dt-bindings: fsi: Document binding for the fsi-master-ast-cf "device"

This isn't per-se a real device, it's a pseudo-device that
represents the use of the Aspeed built-in ColdFire to
implement the FSI protocol by bitbanging the GPIOs instead
of doing it from the ARM core.

Thus it's a drop-in replacement for the existing
fsi-master-gpio pseudo-device for use on systems based
on the Aspeed chips. It has most of the same properties,
plus some more needed to operate the coprocessor.
