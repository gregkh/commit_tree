PCI: pciehp: Drop unnecessary NULL pointer check

pciehp_disable_slot() checks if the ctrl attribute of the slot is NULL
and bails out if so.  However the function is not called prior to the
attribute being set in pcie_init_slot(), and pcie_init_slot() is not
called if ctrl is NULL.  So the check is unnecessary.  Drop it.

It has been present ever since the driver was introduced in 2004, but it
was already unnecessary back then:
