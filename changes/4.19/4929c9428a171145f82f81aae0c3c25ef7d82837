tcp: expose both send and receive intervals for rate sample

Congestion control algorithms, which access the rate sample
through the tcp_cong_control function, only have access to the maximum
of the send and receive interval, for cases where the acknowledgment
rate may be inaccurate due to ACK compression or decimation. Algorithms
may want to use send rates and receive rates as separate signals.
