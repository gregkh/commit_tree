x86/entry/64: Further improve paranoid_entry comments

Commit:

  16561f27f94e ("x86/entry: Add some paranoid entry/exit CR3 handling comments")

... added some comments.  This improves them a bit:

 - When I first read the new comments, it was unclear to me whether
   they were referring to the case where paranoid_entry interrupted
   other entry code or where paranoid_entry was itself interrupted.
   Clarify it.

 - Remove the EBX comment.  We no longer use EBX as a SWAPGS
   indicator.
