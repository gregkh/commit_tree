drm/i915: Declare the driver wedged if hangcheck makes no progress

Hangcheck is our back up in case the GPU or the driver gets stuck. It
detects when the GPU is not making any progress and issues a GPU reset.
However, if the driver is failing to make any progress, we can get
ourselves into a situation where we continually try resetting the GPU to
no avail. Employ a second timeout such that if we continue to see the
same seqno (the stalled engine has made no progress at all) over the
course of several hangchecks, declare the driver wedged and attempt to
start afresh.
