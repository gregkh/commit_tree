gfs2: Further iomap cleanups

In gfs2_iomap_alloc, set the type of newly allocated extents to
IOMAP_MAPPED so that iomap_to_bh will set the bh states correctly:
otherwise, the bhs would not be marked as mapped, confusing
__mpage_writepage.  This means that we need to check for the IOMAP_F_NEW
flag in fallocate_chunk now.

Further clean up gfs2_iomap_get and implement gfs2_stuffed_iomap here
directly.  For reads beyond the end of the file, return holes instead of
failing with -ENOENT so that we can get rid of that special case in
gfs2_block_map.
