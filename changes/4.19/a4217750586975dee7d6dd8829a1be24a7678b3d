mac80211: use BIT_ULL for NL80211_STA_INFO_* attribute types

The BIT macro uses unsigned long which some architectures handle as 32 bit
and therefore might cause macro's shift to overflow when used on a value
equals or larger than 32 (NL80211_STA_INFO_RX_DURATION and afterwards).

Since 'filled' member in station_info changed to u64, BIT_ULL macro
should be used with all NL80211_STA_INFO_* attribute types instead of BIT
to prevent future possible bugs when one will use BIT macro for higher
attributes by mistake.

This commit cleans up all usages of BIT macro with the above field
in mac80211 by changing it to BIT_ULL instead.
