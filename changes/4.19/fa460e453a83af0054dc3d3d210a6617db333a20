drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: write sleep/wake requests to TCS

Sleep and wake requests are sent when the application processor
subsystem of the SoC is entering deep sleep states like in suspend.
These requests help lower the system power requirements when the
resources are not in use.

Sleep and wake requests are written to the TCS slots but are not
triggered at the time of writing. The TCS are triggered by the firmware
after the last of the CPUs has executed its WFI. Since these requests
may come in different batches of requests, it is the job of this
controller driver to find and arrange the requests into the available
TCSes.
