nvmet: track and limit the number of namespaces per subsystem

TP 4004 introduces a new 'Maximum Number of Allocated Namespaces' field
in the Identify controller data to help the host size resources.  Put
an upper limit on the supported namespaces to be able to support this
value as supporting 32-bits worth of namespaces would lead to very
large buffers.  The limit is completely arbitrary at this point.
