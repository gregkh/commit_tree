pinctrl: Support stopping deferred probe after initcalls

Pinctrl drivers are a common dependency which can prevent a system
booting even if the default or bootloader configured settings can work.
If a pinctrl node in DT indicates that the default pin setup can be used
with the 'pinctrl-use-default' property, then only defer probe until
initcalls are done. If the deferred probe timeout is enabled or loadable
modules are disabled, then we'll stop deferring probe regardless of the
DT property. This gives platforms the option to work without their
pinctrl driver being enabled.

Dropped the pinctrl specific deferring probe message as the driver core
can print deferred probe related messages if needed.
