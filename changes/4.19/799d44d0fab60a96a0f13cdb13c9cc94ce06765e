scsi: target/tcm_loop: Avoid that static checkers warn about dead code

The code under the "release:" label can only be reached after se_cmd has
been set to a non-NULL value. Hence remove the if (se_cmd) test.  Keep the
else-part since calling transport_generic_free_cmd() is not necessary for a
command that has not been submitted to the core.
