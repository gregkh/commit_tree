crypto: ahash - remove useless setting of cra_type

Some ahash algorithms set .cra_type = &crypto_ahash_type.  But this is
redundant with the C structure type ('struct ahash_alg'), and
crypto_register_ahash() already sets the .cra_type automatically.
Apparently the useless assignment has just been copy+pasted around.

So, remove the useless assignment from all the ahash algorithms.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
