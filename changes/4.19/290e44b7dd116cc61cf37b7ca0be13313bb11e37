audit: use ktime_get_coarse_real_ts64() for timestamps

Commit c72051d5778a ("audit: use ktime_get_coarse_ts64() for time
access") converted audit's use of current_kernel_time64() to the
new ktime_get_coarse_ts64() function.  Unfortunately this resulted
in incorrect timestamps, e.g. events stamped with the year 1969
despite it being 2018.  This patch corrects this by using
ktime_get_coarse_real_ts64() just like the current_kernel_time64()
wrapper.
