dm thin metadata: try to avoid ever aborting transactions

Committing a transaction can consume some metadata of it's own, we now
reserve a small amount of metadata to cover this.  Free metadata
reported by the kernel will not include this reserve.

If any of the reserve has been used after a commit we enter a new
internal state PM_OUT_OF_METADATA_SPACE.  This is reported as
PM_READ_ONLY, so no userland changes are needed.  If the metadata
device is resized the pool will move back to PM_WRITE.

These changes mean we never need to abort and rollback a transaction due
to running out of metadata space.  This is particularly important
because there have been a handful of reports of data corruption against
DM thin-provisioning that can all be attributed to the thin-pool having
ran out of metadata space.
