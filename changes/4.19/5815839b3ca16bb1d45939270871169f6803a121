blk-mq: introduce new lock for protecting hctx->dispatch_wait

Now hctx->lock is only acquired when adding hctx->dispatch_wait to
one wait queue, but not held when removing it from the wait queue.

IO hang can be observed easily if SCHED RESTART is disabled, that means
now RESTART exits just for fixing the issue in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait().

This patch fixes the issue by introducing hctx->dispatch_wait_lock and
holding it for removing hctx->dispatch_wait in blk_mq_dispatch_wake(),
since we need to avoid acquiring hctx->lock in irq context.
