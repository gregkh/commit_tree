drivers/base: stop new probing during shutdown

There is a race window in device_shutdown(), which may cause
-1. parent device shut down before child or
-2. no shutdown on a new probing device.

For 1st, taking the following scenario:
         device_shutdown                        new plugin device
  list_del_init(parent_dev);
  spin_unlock(list_lock);
                                                  device_add(child)
                                                  probe child
  shutdown parent_dev
       --> now child is on the tail of devices_kset

For 2nd, taking the following scenario:
         device_shutdown                        new plugin device
                                                  device_add(dev)
  device_lock(dev);
  ...
  device_unlock(dev);
                                                  probe dev
       --> now, the new occurred dev has no opportunity to shutdown

To fix this race issue, just prevent the new probing request. With this
logic, device_shutdown() is more similar to dpm_prepare().
