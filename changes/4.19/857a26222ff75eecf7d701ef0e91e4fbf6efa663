fpga: dfl: afu: add afu sub feature support

User Accelerated Function Unit sub feature exposes the MMIO region of
the AFU. After valid PR bitstream is programmed and the port is enabled,
then this MMIO region could be accessed.

This patch adds support to enumerate the AFU MMIO region and expose it
to userspace via mmap file operation. Below interfaces are exposed to user:

Sysfs interface:
* /sys/class/fpga_region/<regionX>/<dfl-port.x>/afu_id
  Read-only. Indicate which PR bitstream is programmed to this AFU.

Ioctl interfaces:
* DFL_FPGA_PORT_GET_INFO
  Provide info to userspace on the number of supported region.
  Only UAFU region is supported now.

* DFL_FPGA_PORT_GET_REGION_INFO
  Provide region information, including access permission, region size,
  offset from the start of device fd.
