firmware: arm_scmi: fix divide by zero when sustained_perf_level is zero

Firmware can provide zero as values for sustained performance level and
corresponding sustained frequency in kHz in order to hide the actual
frequencies and provide only abstract values. It may endup with divide
by zero scenario resulting in kernel panic.

Let's set the multiplication factor to one if either one or both of them
(sustained_perf_level and sustained_freq) are set to zero.
