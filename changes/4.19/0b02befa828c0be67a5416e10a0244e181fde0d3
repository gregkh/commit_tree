drm/i915/execlists: Pull submit after dequeue under timeline lock

In the next patch, we will begin processing the CSB from inside the
submission path (underneath an irqsoff section, and even from inside
interrupt handlers). This means that updating the execlists->port[] will
no longer be serialised by the tasklet but needs to be locked by the
engine->timeline.lock instead. Pull dequeue and submit under the same
lock for protection. (An alternate future plan is to keep the in/out
arrays separate for concurrent processing and reduced lock coverage.)
