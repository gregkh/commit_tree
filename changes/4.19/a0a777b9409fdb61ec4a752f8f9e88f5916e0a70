mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Start using A-TCAM

Now that all the pieces are in place we can start using the A-TCAM
instead of only using the C-TCAM. This allows for much higher scale and
better performance (to be improved further by follow-up patch sets).

Perform the integration with the A-TCAM and the eRP core by reverting
the changes introduced by "mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Enable C-TCAM only mode
in eRP core" and add calls from the C-TCAM code into the eRP core.
