drm/i915/icl: Define PORT_CL_DW_10 register

This register used to power down individual lanes for
DDI/DSI ports. Bitfields to power up/down various
combinations of lanes are also added in this patch.

v2: Review comments from Jani N
    - Use override instead of "override" for bitfields
    - Define mask for override bitfield
    - Define PWR_DOWN_LN* macros shifted in place
v3: Correct PWR_DOWN_LN_MASK value (Jani N)
