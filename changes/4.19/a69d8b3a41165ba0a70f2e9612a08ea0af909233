MAINTAINERS: Update SRP entries

Reflect the acquisition of SanDisk by Western Digital in my e-mail
address. Remove the reference to David Dillow's git tree since SRP patches
are queued by Doug and Jason. Remove the reference to the OpenFabrics
website since the srp_daemon source code has been moved from that website
into the rdma-core project. Add an entry for the SRP target driver.
