powerpc/fadump: merge adjacent memory ranges to reduce PT_LOAD segements

With dynamic memory allocation support for crash memory ranges array,
there is no hard limit on the no. of crash memory ranges kernel could
export, but program headers count could overflow in the /proc/vmcore
ELF file while exporting each memory range as PT_LOAD segment. Reduce
the likelihood of a such scenario, by folding adjacent crash memory
ranges which minimizes the total number of PT_LOAD segments.
