drm/i915/guc: Keep guc submission permanently engaged

We make a decision at module load whether to use the GuC backend or not,
but lose that setup across set-wedge. Currently, the guc doesn't
override the engine->set_default_submission hook letting execlists sneak
back in temporarily on unwedging leading to an unbalanced park/unpark.

v2: Remove comment about switching back temporarily to execlists on
guc_submission_disable(). We currently only call disable on shutdown,
and plan to also call disable before suspend and reset, in which case we
will either restore guc submission or mark the driver as wedged, making
the reset back to execlists pointless.
v3: Move reset.prepare across
