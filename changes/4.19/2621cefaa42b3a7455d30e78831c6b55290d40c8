drm/i915: Provide a timeout to i915_gem_wait_for_idle() on setup

With a broken GPU we expect it to fail during the initial
GPU setup where do a couple of context switches to record the defaults.
This is a task that takes a few milliseconds even on the slowest of
devices, but we may have to wait 60s for hangcheck to give in and
declare the machine inoperable. In this a case where any gpu hang is
unacceptable, both from a timeliness and practical standpoint.

We can therefore set a timeout on our wait-for-idle that is shorter than
the hangcheck (which may be up to 60s for a declaring a wedged driver)
and so detect the broken GPU much more quickly during driver load (and
so prevent stalling userspace for ages).
