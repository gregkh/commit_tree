PCI: Skip MPS logic for Virtual Functions (VFs)

PCIe r4.0, sec 9.3.5.4, "Device Control Register", shows both
Max_Payload_Size (MPS) and Max_Read_request_Size (MRRS) to be 'RsvdP' for
VFs.  Just prior to the table it states:

  "PF and VF functionality is defined in Section 7.5.3.4 except where
   noted in Table 9-16.  For VF fields marked 'RsvdP', the PF setting
   applies to the VF."

All of which implies that with respect to Max_Payload_Size Supported
(MPSS), MPS, and MRRS values, we should not be paying any attention to the
VF's fields, but rather only to the PF's.  Only looking at the PF's fields
also logically makes sense as it's the sole physical interface to the PCIe
bus.
