net/sched: cls_api: add missing validation of netlink attributes

Similarly to what has been done in 8b4c3cdd9dd8 ("net: sched: Add policy
validation for tc attributes"), fix classifier code to add validation of
TCA_CHAIN and TCA_KIND netlink attributes.

tested with:
 # ./tdc.py -c filter

v2: Let sch_api and cls_api share nla_policy they have in common, thanks
    to David Ahern.
v3: Avoid EXPORT_SYMBOL(), as validation of those attributes is not done
    by TC modules, thanks to Cong Wang.
    While at it, restore the 'Delete / get qdisc' comment to its orginal
    position, just above tc_get_qdisc() function prototype.
