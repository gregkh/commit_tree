netns: get more entropy from net_hash_mix()

struct net are effectively allocated from order-1 pages on x86,
with one object per slab, meaning that the 13 low order bits
of their addresses are zero.

Once shifted by L1_CACHE_SHIFT, this leaves 7 zero-bits,
meaning that net_hash_mix() does not help spreading
objects on various hash tables.

For example, TCP listen table has 32 buckets, meaning that
all netns use the same bucket for port 80 or port 443.
