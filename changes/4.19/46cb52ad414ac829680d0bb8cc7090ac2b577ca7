ata: ftide010: Add a quirk for SQ201

The DMA is broken on this specific device for some unknown
reason (probably badly designed or plain broken interface
electronics) and will only work with PIO. Other users of
the same hardware does not have this problem.

Add a specific quirk so that this Gemini device gets
DMA turned off. Also fix up some code around passing the
port information around in probe while we're at it.
