block: Add part_stat_read_accum to read across field entries.

Add a part_stat_read_accum macro to genhd.h to read and sum across
field entries.  For example to sum up the number read and write
sectors completed.  In addition to being ar reasonable cleanup by
itself this will make it easier to add new stat fields in the future.

tj: Refreshed on top of v4.17.
