sched/rt: Add rt_rq utilization tracking

schedutil governor relies on cfs_rq's util_avg to choose the OPP when CFS
tasks are running. When the CPU is overloaded by CFS and RT tasks, CFS tasks
are preempted by RT tasks and in this case util_avg reflects the remaining
capacity but not what CFS want to use. In such case, schedutil can select a
lower OPP whereas the CPU is overloaded. In order to have a more accurate
view of the utilization of the CPU, we track the utilization of RT tasks.
Only util_avg is correctly tracked but not load_avg and runnable_load_avg
which are useless for rt_rq.

rt_rq uses rq_clock_task and cfs_rq uses cfs_rq_clock_task but they are
the same at the root group level, so the PELT windows of the util_sum are
aligned.
