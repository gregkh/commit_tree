ovl: Do not expose metacopy only dentry from d_real()

Metacopy dentry/inode is internal to overlay and is never exposed outside
of it.  Exception is metacopy upper file used for fsync().  Modify d_real()
to look for dentries/inode which have data, but also allow matching upper
inode without data for the fsync case.
