mtd: rawnand: micron: Fix on-die ECC detection logic

Basing the "mandatory on-die" detection on ID byte 2 does not work,
because Micron has plenty of NANDs using the same device ID code, and
not all of them have forcibly enabled on-die ECC.

Since the "Array Operation" feature does not provide the "ECC
enabled/disabled" bit when the ECC can't be disabled, let's try to use
the "ECC enabled/disabled" bit in the READ_ID bytes.

It seems that this bit is dynamically updated on NANDs where on-die ECC
can freely be enabled/disabled, so let's hope it stays at one when we
have a NAND with on-die ECC forcibly enabled.
