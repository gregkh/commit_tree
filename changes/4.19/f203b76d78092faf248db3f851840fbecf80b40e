xfrm: Add virtual xfrm interfaces

This patch adds support for virtual xfrm interfaces.
Packets that are routed through such an interface
are guaranteed to be IPsec transformed or dropped.
It is a generic virtual interface that ensures IPsec
transformation, no need to know what happens behind
the interface. This means that we can tunnel IPv4 and
IPv6 through the same interface and support all xfrm
modes (tunnel, transport and beet) on it.
