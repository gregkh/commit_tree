platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Add CNP SLPS0 debug registers

Adds debugfs access to registers in the Cannon Point PCH PMC that are
useful for debugging #SLP_S0 signal assertion and other low power relate
activities. Device pm states are latched in these registers whenever the
package enters C10 and can be read from slp_s0_debug_status. The pm
states may also be latched by writing 1 to slp_s0_dbg_latch which will
immediately capture the current state on the next read of
slp_s0_debug_status.
