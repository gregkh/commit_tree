btrfs: Get rid of the confusing btrfs_file_extent_inline_len

We used to call btrfs_file_extent_inline_len() to get the uncompressed
data size of an inlined extent.

However this function is hiding evil, for compressed extent, it has no
choice but to directly read out ram_bytes from btrfs_file_extent_item.
While for uncompressed extent, it uses item size to calculate the real
data size, and ignoring ram_bytes completely.

In fact, for corrupted ram_bytes, due to above behavior kernel
btrfs_print_leaf() can't even print correct ram_bytes to expose the bug.

Since we have the tree-checker to verify all EXTENT_DATA, such mismatch
can be detected pretty easily, thus we can trust ram_bytes without the
evil btrfs_file_extent_inline_len().
