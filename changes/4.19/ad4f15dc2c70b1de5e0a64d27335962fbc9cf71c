xen/netfront: don't bug in case of too many frags

Commit 57f230ab04d291 ("xen/netfront: raise max number of slots in
xennet_get_responses()") raised the max number of allowed slots by one.
This seems to be problematic in some configurations with netback using
a larger MAX_SKB_FRAGS value (e.g. old Linux kernel with MAX_SKB_FRAGS
defined as 18 instead of nowadays 17).

Instead of BUG_ON() in this case just fall back to retransmission.
