drm: Consider drivers setting DRIVER_ATOMIC as atomic.

Drivers such as vc4 don't initialize mode_config.funcs until later in
initialization, but we know they're atomic since they've got the flag
set.  This avoids oopsing on dereferencing funcs in the new atomic
methods sanity checks.

I moved the atomic check function down below the core flag check, to
avoid needing a prototype.
