btrfs: Reword dodgy comments in alloc_extent_buffer

Commit eb14ab8ed24a ("Btrfs: fix page->private races") fixed a genuine
race between extent buffer initialisation and btree_releasepage.
Unfortunately as the code has evolved the comments weren't changed which
made them slightly wrong and they weren't very clear in the fist place.
Fix this by (hopefully) rewording them in a more approachable manner.
