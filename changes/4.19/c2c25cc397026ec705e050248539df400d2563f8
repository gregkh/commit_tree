spi: dw-mmio: add MSCC Ocelot support

Because the SPI controller deasserts the chip select when the TX fifo is
empty (which may happen in the middle of a transfer), the CS should be
handled by linux. Unfortunately, some or all of the first four chip
selects are not muxable as GPIOs, depending on the SoC.

There is a way to bitbang those pins by using the SPI boot controller so
use it to set the chip selects.

At init time, it is also necessary to give control of the SPI interface to
the Designware IP.
