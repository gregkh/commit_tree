ACPI / EC: Add another entry for Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th

Commit 2c4d6baf1bc4 (ACPI / EC: Use ec_no_wakeup on more Thinkpad X1
Carbon 6th systems) changed the DMI table to match all systems where
DMI product family is "Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th". However, the system I
have here has this string written differently (ThinkPad vs. Thinkpad)
which makes the match fail.

In addition to that, after BIOS upgrade Robin now has the same string
than my system has (perhaps newer BIOS has changed the string).

In any case add another DMI entry to acpi_ec_no_wakeup[] table hopefully
covering all the X1 Carbon 6th systems out there.
