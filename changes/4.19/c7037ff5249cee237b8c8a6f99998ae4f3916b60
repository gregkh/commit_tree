rcu: Clarify and correct the rcu_preempt_qs() header comment

The rcu_preempt_qs() function only applies to the CPU, not the task.
A task really is allowed to invoke this function while in an RCU-preempt
read-side critical section, but only if it has first added itself to
some leaf rcu_node structure's ->blkd_tasks list.
