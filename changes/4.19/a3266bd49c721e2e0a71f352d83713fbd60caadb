mm: provide a fallback for PAGE_KERNEL_RO for architectures

Some architectures do not define certain PAGE_KERNEL_* flags, this is
either because:

 a) The way to implement some of these flags is *not yet ported*, or
 b) The architecture *has no way* to describe them

Over time we have accumulated a few PAGE_KERNEL_* fallback workarounds
for architectures in the kernel which do not define them using
*relatively safe* equivalents.  Move these scattered fallback hacks into
asm-generic.

We start off with PAGE_KERNEL_RO using PAGE_KERNEL as a fallback.  This
has been in place on the firmware loader for years.  Move the fallback
into the respective asm-generic header.
