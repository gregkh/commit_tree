drm/amdgpu: rework suspend and resume to deal with atomic changes

Use the newly split ip suspend functions to do suspend displays
first (to deal with atomic so that FBs can be unpinned before
attempting to evict vram), then evict vram, then suspend the
other IPs.  Also move the non-DC pinning code to only be
called in the non-DC cases since atomic should take care of
DC.
