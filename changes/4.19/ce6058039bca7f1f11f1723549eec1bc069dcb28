drm/arm/malidp: Add modifier definitions for describing Arm Framebuffer Compression (AFBC).

AFBC is a proprietary lossless image compression protocol and format.
It provides fine-grained random access and minimizes the amount of data
transferred between IP blocks.
AFBC has several features which may be supported and/or used, which are
represented using bits in the modifier. Not all combinations are valid,
and different devices or use-cases may support different combinations.
