xen/netfront: fix waiting for xenbus state change

Commit 822fb18a82aba ("xen-netfront: wait xenbus state change when load
module manually") added a new wait queue to wait on for a state change
when the module is loaded manually. Unfortunately there is no wakeup
anywhere to stop that waiting.

Instead of introducing a new wait queue rename the existing
module_unload_q to module_wq and use it for both purposes (loading and
unloading).

As any state change of the backend might be intended to stop waiting
do the wake_up_all() in any case when netback_changed() is called.
