auxdisplay: charlcd: delete mdelay in long_sleep

The function long_sleep() calls mdelay() when in an interrupt handler.
But only charlcd_clear_display() and charlcd_init_display calls
long_sleep(), and my tool finds that the two functions
are never called in an interrupt handler.
Thus mdelay() and in_interrupt() are not necessary.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
