ovl: Do not do metacopy only for ioctl modifying file attr

ovl_copy_up() by default will only do metadata only copy up (if enabled).
That means when ovl_real_ioctl() calls ovl_real_file(), it will still get
the lower file (as ovl_real_file() opens data file and not metacopy).  And
that means "chattr +i" will end up modifying lower inode.

There seem to be two ways to solve this.
A. Open metacopy file in ovl_real_ioctl() and do operations on that
B. Force full copy up when FS_IOC_SETFLAGS is called.

I am resorting to option B for now as it feels little safer option.  If
there are performance issues due to this, we can revisit it.
