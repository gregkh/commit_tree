ARM: dts: imx6qdl-colibri: move card detect to module device tree

Muxing the card detect only in the carrier board device tree
overwrites the USDHC muxing in the module level device tree.
Move card detect to the module level device tree since this
is also a default pinout of the Colibri standard. If a carrier
board requires a different setting it still can overwrite the
nodes in the carrier board specific device tree.
