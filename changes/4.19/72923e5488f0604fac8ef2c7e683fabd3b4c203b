Revert "pinctrl: intel: Do pin translation when lock IRQ"

This reverts commit 55aedef50d4d810670916d9fce4a40d5da2079e7.

Commit 55aedef50d4d ("pinctrl: intel: Do pin translation when lock IRQ")
added special translation from GPIO number to hardware pin number to
irq_reqres/relres hooks to avoid failure when IRQs are requested. The
actual failure happened inside gpiochip_lock_as_irq() because it calls
gpiod_get_direction() and pinctrl-intel.c::intel_gpio_get_direction()
implementation originally missed the translation so the two hooks made
it work by skipping the ->get_direction() call entirely (it overwrote
the default GPIOLIB provided functions).

The proper fix that adds translation to GPIO callbacks was merged with
commit 96147db1e1df ("pinctrl: intel: Do pin translation in other GPIO
operations as well"). This allows us to use the default GPIOLIB provided
functions again.

In addition as find out by Benjamin Tissoires the two functions
(intel_gpio_irq_reqres()/intel_gpio_irq_relres()) now cause problems of
their own because they operate on pin numbers and pass that pin number
to gpiochip_lock_as_irq() which actually expects a GPIO number.
