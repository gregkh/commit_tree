xen/spinlock: Don't use pvqspinlock if only 1 vCPU

On a VM with only 1 vCPU, the locking fast paths will always be
successful. In this case, there is no need to use the the PV qspinlock
code which has higher overhead on the unlock side than the native
qspinlock code.

The xen_pvspin veriable is also turned off in this 1 vCPU case to
eliminate unneeded pvqspinlock initialization in xen_init_lock_cpu()
which is run after xen_init_spinlocks().
