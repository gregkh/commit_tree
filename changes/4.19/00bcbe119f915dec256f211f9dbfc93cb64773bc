pNFS: Don't update the stateid when replying NFS4ERR_DELAY to a layout recall

RFC5661 doesn't state directly that the client should update the layout
stateid if it returns NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT in response to a recall,
however it does state that this error will "cleanly indicate completion"
on par with returning the layout. For this reason, we assume that the
client should update the layout stateid. The Linux pNFS server definitely
does expect this behaviour.

However, if the client replies NFS4ERR_DELAY, then it is stating that
the recall was not processed, so it would be very wrong to update the
layout stateid.
