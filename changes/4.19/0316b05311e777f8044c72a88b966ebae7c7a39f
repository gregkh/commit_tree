MIPS: ath79: get PCIe controller out of reset

The ar724x pci driver expects the PCIe controller to be brought out of
reset by the bootloader.

At least the AVM Fritz 300E bootloader doesn't take care of releasing
the different PCIe controller related resets which causes an endless
hang as soon as either the PCIE Reset register (0x180f0018) or the PCI
Application Control register (0x180f0000) is read from.

Do the full "PCIE Root Complex Initialization Sequence" if the PCIe
host controller is still in reset during probing.

The QCA u-boot sleeps 10ms after the PCIE Application Control bit is
set to ready. It has been shown that 10ms might not be enough time if
PCIe should be used right after setting the bit. During my tests it
took up to 20ms till the link was up. Giving the link up to 100ms
should work for all cases.
