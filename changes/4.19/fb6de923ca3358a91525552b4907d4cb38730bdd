regulator: fix crash caused by null driver data

dev_set_drvdata() needs to be called before device_register()
exposes device to userspace. Otherwise kernel crashes after it
gets null pointer from dev_get_drvdata() when userspace tries
to access sysfs entries.

[Removed backtrace for length -- broonie]
