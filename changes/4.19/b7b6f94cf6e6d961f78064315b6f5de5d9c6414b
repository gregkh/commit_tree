rculist: Improve documentation for list_for_each_entry_from_rcu()

Unfortunately the patch for adding list_for_each_entry_from_rcu()
wasn't the final patch after all review.  It is functionally
correct but the documentation was incomplete.

This patch adds this missing documentation which includes an update to
the documentation for list_for_each_entry_continue_rcu() to match the
documentation for the new list_for_each_entry_from_rcu(), and adds
list_for_each_entry_from_rcu() and the already existing
hlist_for_each_entry_from_rcu() to section 7 of whatisRCU.txt.
