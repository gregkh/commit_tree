ASoC: dmaengine: Fix missing __user prefix in copy_user callback

It seems that __user prefix was forgotten to be added to
dmaengine_copy_user callback while we refactored the user-copy PCM
core.

This patch adds the missing prefix, remove the superfluous cast, and
add the needed cast (__force is needed for downgrading from user
pointer to kernel pointer), too.

Spotted by a sparse warning like:
  sound/soc/soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.c:397:27: warning: incorrect type in initializer (incompatible argument 4 (different address spaces))
