fbcon: Do not takeover the console from atomic context

Taking over the console involves allocating mem with GFP_KERNEL, talking
to drm drivers, etc. So this should not be done from an atomic context.

But the console-output trigger deferred console takeover may happen from an
atomic context, which leads to "BUG: sleeping function called from invalid
context" errors.

This commit fixes these errors by doing the deferred takeover from a
workqueue.
