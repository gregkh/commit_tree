block: don't warn when doing fsync on read-only devices

It is possible to call fsync on a read-only handle (for example, fsck.ext2
does it when doing read-only check), and this call results in kernel
warning.

The patch b089cfd95d32 ("block: don't warn for flush on read-only device")
attempted to disable the warning, but it is buggy and it doesn't
(op_is_flush tests flags, but bio_op strips off the flags).
