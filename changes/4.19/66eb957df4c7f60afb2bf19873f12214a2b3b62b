riscv: Delete asm/compat.h

riscv does not enable CONFIG_COMPAT in default configurations:
defconfig, allmodconfig and allnoconfig.
Remove the asm/compat.h as it does not seem to add any value to
the architecture without CONFIG_COMPAT.

Now that time compat syscalls are being reused in non CONFIG_COMPAT
modes, asm-generic/compat.h provides definitions for riscv 32 bit
mode.
