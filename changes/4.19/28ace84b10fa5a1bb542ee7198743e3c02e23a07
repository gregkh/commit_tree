be2net: move rss_flags field in rss_info to ensure proper alignment

The current position of .rss_flags field in struct rss_info causes
that fields .rsstable and .rssqueue (both 128 bytes long) crosses
cache-line boundaries. Moving it at the end properly align all fields.

Before patch:
struct rss_info {
        u64                        rss_flags;            /*     0     8 */
        u8                         rsstable[128];        /*     8   128 */
        /* --- cacheline 2 boundary (128 bytes) was 8 bytes ago --- */
        u8                         rss_queue[128];       /*   136   128 */
        /* --- cacheline 4 boundary (256 bytes) was 8 bytes ago --- */
        u8                         rss_hkey[40];         /*   264    40 */
};

After patch:
struct rss_info {
        u8                         rsstable[128];        /*     0   128 */
        /* --- cacheline 2 boundary (128 bytes) --- */
        u8                         rss_queue[128];       /*   128   128 */
        /* --- cacheline 4 boundary (256 bytes) --- */
        u8                         rss_hkey[40];         /*   256    40 */
        u64                        rss_flags;            /*   296     8 */
};
