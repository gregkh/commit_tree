igb: Use dma_wmb() instead of wmb() before doorbell writes

igb writes to doorbells to post transmit and receive descriptors;
after writing descriptors to memory but before writing to doorbells,
use dma_wmb() rather than wmb(). wmb() is more heavyweight than
necessary before doorbell writes.

On x86, this avoids SFENCEs before doorbell writes in both the
tx and rx refill paths.
