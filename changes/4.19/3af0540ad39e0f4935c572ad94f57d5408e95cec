usb: dwc2: Turn on uframe_sched on "amlogic" platforms

There's no reason to have the uframe scheduler off on dwc2.  Running
with uframe_sched = False is equivalent to saying "I don't want to run
the correct code, I want to run the old and incorrect code".

The uframe scheduler has been off on Amlogic since commit f94310ac076e
("usb: dwc2: add support for Meson8b and GXBB SoCs").  While this was
after most of the recent improvements, notably the commit 9f9f09b048f5
("usb: dwc2: host: Totally redo the microframe scheduler"), presumably
the parameters were copied from another platform and the uframe
scheduler wasn't tried.

Presumably if everyone is good w/ the uframe_sched turned back on we
can kill all the old and crufty non-uframe sched code.
