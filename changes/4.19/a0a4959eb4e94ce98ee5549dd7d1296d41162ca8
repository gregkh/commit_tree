ALSA: usb-audio: Operate UAC3 Power Domains in PCM callbacks

Make use of UAC3 Power Domains associated to an Audio Streaming
path within the PCM's logic. This means, when there is no audio
being transferred (pcm is closed), the host will set the Power Domain
associated to that substream to state D1. When audio is being transferred
(from hw_params onwards), the Power Domain will be set to D0 state.

This is the way the host lets the device know which Terminal
is going to be actively used and it is for the device to
manage its own internal resources on that UAC3 Power Domain.

Note the resume method now sets the Power Domain to D1 state as
resuming the device doesn't mean audio streaming will occur.
