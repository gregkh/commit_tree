binfmt_elf: Respect error return from `regset->active'

The regset API documented in <linux/regset.h> defines -ENODEV as the
result of the `->active' handler to be used where the feature requested
is not available on the hardware found.  However code handling core file
note generation in `fill_thread_core_info' interpretes any non-zero
result from the `->active' handler as the regset requested being active.
Consequently processing continues (and hopefully gracefully fails later
on) rather than being abandoned right away for the regset requested.

Fix the problem then by making the code proceed only if a positive
result is returned from the `->active' handler.
