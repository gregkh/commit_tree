vt: unicode fallback for scrollback

There is currently no provision for scrollback content in the core code,
leaving that to backend video drivers where this can be highly optimized.
There is currently no common method for those drivers to tell the core
what part of the scrollback is actually displayed and what size the
scrollback buffer is either. Because of that, the unicode screen buffer
has no provision for any scrollback.

At least we can provide backtranslated glyph values when the scrollback
is active which should be plenty good enough for now.
