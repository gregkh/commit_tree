PCI: shpchp: Separate existence of SHPC and permission to use it

The shpchp driver registers for all PCI bridge devices.  Its probe method
should fail if either (1) the bridge doesn't have an SHPC or (2) the OS
isn't allowed to use it (the platform firmware may be operating the SHPC
itself).

Separate these two tests into:

  - A new shpc_capable() that looks for the SHPC hardware and is applicable
    on all systems (ACPI and non-ACPI), and

  - A simplified acpi_get_hp_hw_control_from_firmware() that we call only
    when we already know an SHPC exists and there may be ACPI methods to
    either request permission to use it (_OSC) or transfer control to the
    OS (OSHP).

acpi_get_hp_hw_control_from_firmware() is implemented when CONFIG_ACPI=y,
but does nothing if the current platform doesn't support ACPI.
