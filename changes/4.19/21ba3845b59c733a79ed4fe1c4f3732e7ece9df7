smb3: fill in statfs fsid and correct namelen

Fil in the correct namelen (typically 255 not 4096) in the
statfs response and also fill in a reasonably unique fsid

of the volume).

In the case of the POSIX statfs all fields are now filled in,
and in the case of non-POSIX mounts, all fields are filled
in which can be.
