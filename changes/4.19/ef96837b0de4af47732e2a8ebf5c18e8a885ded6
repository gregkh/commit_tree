ima: add build time policy

IMA by default does not measure, appraise or audit files, but can be
enabled at runtime by specifying a builtin policy on the boot command line
or by loading a custom policy.

This patch defines a build time policy, which verifies kernel modules,
firmware, kexec image, and/or the IMA policy signatures.  This build time
policy is automatically enabled at runtime and persists after loading a
custom policy.
