rcu: Fix an obsolete ->qsmaskinit comment

Back in the old days, when grace-period initialization blocked CPU
hotplug, the ->qsmaskinit mask was indeed updated at the time that
a given CPU went offline.  However, with the deferral of these updates
until the beginning of the next grace period in commit 0aa04b055e71
("rcu: Process offlining and onlining only at grace-period start"),
it is instead ->qsmaskinitnext that gets updated at that time.

This commit therefore updates the obsolete comment.  It also fixes
punctuation while on the topic of comments mentioning ->qsmaskinit.
