cnic: remove redundant pointer req and variable func

Pointer req and variable func are being assigned but are never used
hence they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'req' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'func' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
