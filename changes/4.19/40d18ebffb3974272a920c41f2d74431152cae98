mm/hugetlb: remove gigantic page support for HIGHMEM

This reverts ee8f248d266e ("hugetlb: add phys addr to struct
huge_bootmem_page").

At one time powerpc used this field and supporting code.  However that
was removed with commit 79cc38ded1e1 ("powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Add support
for reserving gigantic huge pages via kernel command line").

There are no users of this field and supporting code, so remove it.
