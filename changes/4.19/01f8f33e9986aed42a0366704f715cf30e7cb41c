drm/i915: Always retire residual requests before suspend

If the driver is wedged, we skip idling the GPU. However, we may still
have a few requests still not retired following the wedging (since they
will be waiting for a background worker trying to acquire struct_mutex).
As we hold the struct_mutex, always do a quick request retirement in
order to flush the wedged path.
