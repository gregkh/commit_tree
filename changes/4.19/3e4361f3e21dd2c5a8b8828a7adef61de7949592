staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page c Bit Mask definitions - Style

Remove the unused 'page c' Bit Mask definitions. These definitions will
fail the checkpatch CamelCase naming test. Rather then renaming, as the
definitions are unused in code, they have simply been removed.

The change is a coding style change which should not impact runtime
code execution.
