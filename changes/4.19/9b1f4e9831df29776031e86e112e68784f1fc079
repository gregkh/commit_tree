xfs: cancel dfops on xfs_defer_finish() error

The current semantics of xfs_defer_finish() require the caller to
call xfs_defer_cancel() on error. This is slightly inconsistent with
transaction commit error handling where a failed commit cleans up
the transaction before returning.

More significantly, the only requirement for exposure of
->dop_pending outside of xfs_defer_finish() is so that
xfs_defer_cancel() can drain it on error. Since the only recourse of
xfs_defer_finish() errors is cancellation, mirror the transaction
logic and cancel remaining dfops before returning from
xfs_defer_finish() with an error.

Beside simplifying xfs_defer_finish() semantics, this ensures that
xfs_defer_finish() always returns with an empty ->dop_pending and
thus facilitates removal of the list from xfs_defer_ops.
