h8300: Don't include linux/kernel.h in asm/atomic.h

linux/kernel.h isn't needed by asm/atomic.h and will result in circular
dependencies when the asm-generic atomic bitops are built around the
tomic_long_t interface.

Remove the broad include and replace it with linux/compiler.h for
READ_ONCE etc and asm/irqflags.h for arch_local_irq_save etc.
