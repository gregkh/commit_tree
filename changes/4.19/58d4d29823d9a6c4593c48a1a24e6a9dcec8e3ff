drm/sun4i: fix build failure with CONFIG_DRM_SUN8I_MIXER=m

Having DRM_SUN4I built-in but DRM_SUN8I_MIXER as a loadable module results in
a link error, as we try to access a symbol from the sun8i_tcon_top.ko module:

ERROR: "sun8i_tcon_top_of_table" [drivers/gpu/drm/sun4i/sun8i-drm-hdmi.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "sun8i_tcon_top_of_table" [drivers/gpu/drm/sun4i/sun4i-drm.ko] undefined!

This solves the problem by adding a silent symbol for the tcon_top module,
building it as a separate module in exactly the cases that we need it,
but in a way that it is reachable by the other modules.
