tls: zero the crypto information from tls_context before freeing

This contains key material in crypto_send_aes_gcm_128 and
crypto_recv_aes_gcm_128.

Introduce union tls_crypto_context, and replace the two identical
unions directly embedded in struct tls_context with it. We can then
use this union to clean up the memory in the new tls_ctx_free()
function.
