x86/intel_rdt: Add utility to restrict/restore access to resctrl files

When a resource group is used for Cache Pseudo-Locking then the region of
cache ends up being orphaned with no class of service referring to it. The
resctrl files intended to manage how the classes of services are utilized
thus become irrelevant.

The fact that a resctrl file is not relevant can be communicated to the
user by setting all of its permissions to zero. That is, its read, write,
and execute permissions are unset for all users.

Introduce two utilities, rdtgroup_kn_mode_restrict() and
rdtgroup_kn_mode_restore(), that can be used to restrict and restore the
permissions of a file or directory belonging to a resource group.
