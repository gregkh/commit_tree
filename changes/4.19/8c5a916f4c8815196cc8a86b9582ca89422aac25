ARM: OMAP2+: sleep33/43xx: Add RTC-Mode support

Add support for RTC mode to low level suspend code. This includes
providing the rtc base address for the assembly code to configuring the
PMIC_PWR_EN line late in suspend to enter RTC+DDR mode.

Note: This patch also fold in left out space parameter for
am33xx_emif_sram_table and am43xx_emif_sram_table
