ASoC: arizona: Set compressed IRQ to a wake source

The current code is not setting the compressed IRQ as a wake
source.  Normally this doesn't cause any issues as the CODEC
IRQ is set as a wake source by the jack detection code and the
CODEC only produces a single IRQ line. However if the system
is not using jack detection the compressed audio IRQ should
still function as a wake source, as such directly set the
compressed audio IRQ as a wake source.
