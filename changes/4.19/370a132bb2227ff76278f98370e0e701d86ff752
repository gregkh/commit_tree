x86/microcode: Make sure boot_cpu_data.microcode is up-to-date

When preparing an MCE record for logging, boot_cpu_data.microcode is used
to read out the microcode revision on the box.

However, on systems where late microcode update has happened, the microcode
revision output in a MCE log record is wrong because
boot_cpu_data.microcode is not updated when the microcode gets updated.

But, the microcode revision saved in boot_cpu_data's microcode member
should be kept up-to-date, regardless, for consistency.

Make it so.
