ovl: Treat metacopy dentries as type OVL_PATH_MERGE

Right now OVL_PATH_MERGE is used only for merged directories.  But
conceptually, a metacopy dentry (backed by a lower data dentry) is a merged
entity as well.

So mark metacopy dentries as OVL_PATH_MERGE and ovl_rename() makes use of
this property later to set redirect on a metacopy file.
