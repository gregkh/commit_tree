ALSA: seq: Minor cleanup of MIDI event parser helpers

snd_midi_event_encode_byte() can never fail, and it can return rather
true/false.  Change the return type to bool, adjust the argument to
receive a MIDI byte as unsigned char, and adjust the comment
accordingly.  This allows callers to drop error checks, which
simplifies the code.

Meanwhile, snd_midi_event_encode() helper is used only in seq_midi.c,
and it can be better folded into it.  This will reduce the total
amount of lines in the end.
