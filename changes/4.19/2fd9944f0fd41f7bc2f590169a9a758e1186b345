autofs: fix inconsistent use of now variable

The global variable "now" in fs/autofs/expire.c is used in an inconsistent
way, sometimes using jiffies directly, and sometimes using the "now"
variable, and setting it isn't done consistently either.

But the autofs dentry info last_used field is only updated during path
walks or during expire so jiffies can be used directly and the global
variable "now" removed.
