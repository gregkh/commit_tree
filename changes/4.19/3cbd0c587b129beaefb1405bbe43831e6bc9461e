drm/omap: gem: Replace struct_mutex usage with omap_obj private lock

The DRM device struct_mutex is used to protect against concurrent GEM
object operations that deal with memory allocation and pinning. All
those operations are local to a GEM object and don't need to be
serialized across different GEM objects. Replace the struct_mutex with
a local omap_obj.lock or drop it altogether where not needed.
