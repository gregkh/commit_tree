r8169: Get and enable optional ether_clk clock

On some boards a platform clock is used as clock for the r8169 chip,
this commit adds support for getting and enabling this clock (assuming
it has an "ether_clk" alias set on it).

This is related to commit d31fd43c0f9a ("clk: x86: Do not gate clocks
enabled by the firmware") which is a previous attempt to fix this for some
x86 boards, but this causes all Cherry Trail SoC using boards to not reach
there lowest power states when suspending.

This commit (together with an atom-pmc-clk driver commit adding the alias)
fixes things properly by making the r8169 get the clock and enable it when
it needs it.
