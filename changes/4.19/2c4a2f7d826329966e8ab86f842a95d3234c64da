virtio_net: Make drop counter per-queue

Since when XDP was introduced, drop counter has been able to be updated
much more frequently than before, as XDP_DROP increments the counter.
Thus for performance analysis per-queue drop counter would be useful.

Also this avoids cache contention and race on updating the counter. It
is currently racy because napi handlers read-modify-write it without any
locks.

There are more counters in dev->stats that are racy, but I left them
per-device, because they are rarely updated and does not worth being
per-queue counters IMHO. To fix them we need atomic ops or some kind of
locks.
