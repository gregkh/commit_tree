rcu: Record ->gp_state for both phases of grace-period initialization

Grace-period initialization first processes any recent CPU-hotplug
operations, and then initializes state for the new grace period.  These
two phases of initialization are currently not distinguished in debug
prints, but the distinction is valuable in a number of debug situations.
This commit therefore introduces two new values for ->gp_state,
RCU_GP_ONOFF and RCU_GP_INIT, in order to make this distinction.
