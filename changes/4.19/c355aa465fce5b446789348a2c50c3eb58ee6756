ubi: expose the volume CRC check skip flag

Now that we have the logic for skipping CRC check for static UBI volumes
in the core, let's expose it to users.

This makes use of a padding byte in the volume description data
structure as a flag. This flag only tell for now whether we should skip
the CRC check of a volume.

This checks the UBI volume for which we are trying to skip the CRC check
is static.

Let's also make sure that the flags passed to verify_mkvol_req are
valid.

We voluntarily do not take into account the skip_check flag in
vol_cdev_write() as we want to make sure what we wrote was correctly
written.
