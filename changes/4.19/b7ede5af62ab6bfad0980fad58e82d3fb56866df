ASoC: wm_adsp: Take prefix into account in control name length

Currently when creating ALSA control names for the DSP the length of any
prefix applied to the CODEC is not taken into account. Whilst this is
mostly harmless it does result in ALSA doing the truncation of the
control names and printing a warning. It is better to have the driver do
the truncation so it can truncate from the start of parameter name
itself to give a greater chance of the result maintain a unique name.
