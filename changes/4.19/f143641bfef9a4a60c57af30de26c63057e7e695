tracing: Do not call start/stop() functions when tracing_on does not change

Currently, when one echo's in 1 into tracing_on, the current tracer's
"start()" function is executed, even if tracing_on was already one. This can
lead to strange side effects. One being that if the hwlat tracer is enabled,
and someone does "echo 1 > tracing_on" into tracing_on, the hwlat tracer's
start() function is called again which will recreate another kernel thread,
and make it unable to remove the old one.
