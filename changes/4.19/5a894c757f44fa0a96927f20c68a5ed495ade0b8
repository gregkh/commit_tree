staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page-9 Bit Mask definitions - Style

Remove the unused page-9 Bit Mask definitions. These definitions fail
the checkpatch CamelCase naming tests. Since the definitions are unused
in code they have simply been removed, rather then renaming. The change
is purely a coding style change and should not impact runtime code
execution.
