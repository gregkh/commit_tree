drm/amd/display: properly turn autocal off

[why]
Currently we do not turn off autocal when scaling is in bypass.
In case vbios enalbes auto scale and our first mode set is a non-scaled
mode we have autocal on causing screen corruption.

[how]
moves turning autocal off to be first thing done during scaler setup
