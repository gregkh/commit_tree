tpm: Implement tpm_default_chip() to find a TPM chip

Implement tpm_default_chip() to find the first TPM chip and return it to
the caller while increasing the reference count on its device. This
function can be used by other subsystems, such as IMA, to find the system's
default TPM chip and use it for all subsequent TPM operations.
