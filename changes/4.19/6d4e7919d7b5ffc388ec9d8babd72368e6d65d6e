media: dt-bindings: media: Define "rotation" property for sensors

Sensors are occasionally mounted upside down to systems such as mobile
phones or tablets. In order to use such a sensor without having to turn
every image upside down, most camera sensors support reversing the readout
order by setting both horizontal and vertical flipping.

This patch documents the "rotation" property for camera sensors, mirroring
what is defined for displays in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/panel.txt .
