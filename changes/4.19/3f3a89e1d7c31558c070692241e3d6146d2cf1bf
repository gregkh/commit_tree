i2c: remove i2c_lock_adapter and use i2c_lock_bus directly

The i2c_lock_adapter name is ambiguous since it is unclear if it
refers to the root adapter or the adapter you name in the argument.
The natural interpretation is the adapter you name in the argument,
but there are historical reasons for that not being the case; it
in fact locks the root adapter. Just remove the function and force
users to spell out the I2C_LOCK_ROOT_ADAPTER name to indicate what
is really going on. Also remove i2c_unlock_adapter, of course.

This patch was generated with

git grep -l 'i2c_\(un\)\?lock_adapter' \
| xargs sed -i 's/i2c_\(un\)\?lock_adapter(\([^)]*\))/'\
'i2c_\1lock_bus(\2, I2C_LOCK_ROOT_ADAPTER)/g'

followed by white-space touch-up.
