drm/amd/display: Honor pplib stutter mask for all ASICs in DC

[Why]
We were only setting this mask for DCN, but should really use it
universally for all ASICs.

[How]
Move the assignment out of the Raven switch statement for all ASICs
other than Stoney and Carrizo.

v2: Keep stutter always on for Carrizo and Stoney (Alex)
