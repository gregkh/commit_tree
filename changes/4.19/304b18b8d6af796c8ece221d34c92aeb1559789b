fs/epoll: loosen irq safety in epoll_insert() and epoll_remove()

Both functions are similar to the context of ep_modify(), called via
epoll_ctl(2).  Just like ep_modify(), saving and restoring interrupts is
an overkill in these calls as it will never be called with irqs disabled.
While ep_remove() can be called directly from EPOLL_CTL_DEL, it can also
be called when releasing the file, but this also complies with the above.
