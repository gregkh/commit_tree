drm/amdgpu: Update power state at the end of smu hw_init.

For SI/Kv, the power state is managed by function
amdgpu_pm_compute_clocks.

when dpm enabled, we should call amdgpu_pm_compute_clocks
to update current power state instand of set boot state.

this change can fix the oops when kfd driver was enabled on Kv.
