arm64: topology: refactor reset_cpu_topology to add support for removing topology

Currently reset_cpu_topology clears all the CPU topology information
and resets to default values. However we may need to just clear the
information when we hotplug out the CPU. In preparation to add the
support the same, let's refactor reset_cpu_topology to just reset
the information and move clearing out the topology information to
clear_cpu_topology.
