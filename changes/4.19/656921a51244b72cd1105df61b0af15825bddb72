drm/i915: Fix psr sink status report.

First of all don't try to read dpcd if PSR is not even supported.

But also, if read failed return -EIO instead of reporting via a
backchannel.

v2: fix dev_priv: At this level m->private is the connector. (CI/DK)
    don't convert dpcd read errors to EIO. (DK)
