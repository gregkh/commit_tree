mtd: rawnand: davinci: convert driver to nand_scan()

Two helpers have been added to the core to do all kind of controller
side configuration/initialization between the detection phase and the
final NAND scan. Implement these hooks so that we can convert the driver
to just use nand_scan() instead of the nand_scan_ident() +
nand_scan_tail() pair.

Also change the unused "struct device *dev" parameter of the driver
structure into a platform device to reuse it in the ->attach_chip()
hook.
