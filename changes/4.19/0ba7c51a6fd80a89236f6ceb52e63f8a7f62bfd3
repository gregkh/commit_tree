drm/i915: Fix hotplug irq ack on i965/g4x

Just like with PIPESTAT, the edge triggered IIR on i965/g4x
also causes problems for hotplug interrupts. To make sure
we don't get the IIR port interrupt bit stuck low with the
ISR bit high we must force an edge in ISR. Unfortunately
we can't borrow the PIPESTAT trick and toggle the enable
bits in PORT_HOTPLUG_EN as that act itself generates hotplug
interrupts. Instead we just have to loop until we've cleared
PORT_HOTPLUG_STAT, or we just give up and WARN.

v2: Don't frob with PORT_HOTPLUG_EN
