hv/netvsc: Fix NULL dereference at single queue mode fallback

The recent commit 916c5e1413be ("hv/netvsc: fix handling of fallback
to single queue mode") tried to fix the fallback behavior to a single
queue mode, but it changed the function to return zero incorrectly,
while the function should return an object pointer.  Eventually this
leads to a NULL dereference at the callers that expect non-NULL
value.

Fix it by returning the proper net_device object.
