drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau: Fix bogus drm_kms_helper_poll_enable() placement

Turns out this part is my fault for not noticing when reviewing
9a2eba337cace ("drm/nouveau: Fix drm poll_helper handling"). Currently
we call drm_kms_helper_poll_enable() from nouveau_display_hpd_work().
This makes basically no sense however, because that means we're calling
drm_kms_helper_poll_enable() every time we schedule the hotplug
detection work. This is also against the advice mentioned in
drm_kms_helper_poll_enable()'s documentation:

 Note that calls to enable and disable polling must be strictly ordered,
 which is automatically the case when they're only call from
 suspend/resume callbacks.

Of course, hotplugs can't really be ordered. They could even happen
immediately after we called drm_kms_helper_poll_disable() in
nouveau_display_fini(), which can lead to all sorts of issues.

Additionally; enabling polling /after/ we call
drm_helper_hpd_irq_event() could also mean that we'd miss a hotplug
event anyway, since drm_helper_hpd_irq_event() wouldn't bother trying to
probe connectors so long as polling is disabled.

So; simply move this back into nouveau_display_init() again. The race
condition that both of these patches attempted to work around has
already been fixed properly in
