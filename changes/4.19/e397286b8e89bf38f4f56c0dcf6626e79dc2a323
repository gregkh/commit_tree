r8169: remove TBI 1000BaseX support

The very first version of RTL8169 from 2002 (and only this one) has
support for a TBI 1000BaseX fiber interface. The TBI support in the
driver makes switching to phylib tricky, so best would be to get
rid of it. I found no report from anybody using a device with RTL8169
and fiber interface, also the vendor driver doesn't support this mode
(any longer).
So remove TBI support and bail out with a message if a card with
activated TBI is detected. If there really should be any user of it
out there, we could add a stripped-down version of the driver
supporting chip version 01 and TBI only (and maybe move it to
staging).
