ceph: add new field max_file_size in ceph_fs_client

In order to not bother to VFS and other specific filesystems,
we decided to do offset validation inside ceph kernel client,
so just simply set sb->s_maxbytes to MAX_LFS_FILESIZE so that
it can successfully pass VFS check. We add new field max_file_size
in ceph_fs_client to store real file size limit and doing proper
check based on it.
