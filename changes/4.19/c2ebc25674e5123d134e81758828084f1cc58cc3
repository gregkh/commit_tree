l2tp: fix unused function warning

Removing one of the callers of pppol2tp_session_get_sock caused a harmless
warning in some configurations:

net/l2tp/l2tp_ppp.c:142:21: 'pppol2tp_session_get_sock' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Rather than adding another #ifdef here, using a proper IS_ENABLED()
check makes the code more readable and avoids those warnings while
letting the compiler figure out for itself which code is needed.

This adds one pointer for the unused show() callback in struct
l2tp_session, but that seems harmless.
