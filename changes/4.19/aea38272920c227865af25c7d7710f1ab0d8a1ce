mt76: fix beacon timer drift

The beacon timer drifts by 1 microsecond every TBTT. After 20 minutes
with a beacon interval of 100, the drift will be almost 12 ms, enough to
cause weird issues for devices in powersave mode.

Since the beacon timer is configured in units of 1/16 TU (64 us), we
need to adjust it once every 64 beacons and only for one beacon.
