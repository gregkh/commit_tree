gnss: add driver for u-blox receivers

Add driver for serial-connected u-blox GNSS receivers.

Note that the driver uses the generic GNSS serial implementation and
therefore essentially only manages power abstracted into three power
states: ACTIVE, STANDBY, and OFF.

For u-blox receivers with a main supply and no enable-gpios, this simply
means that the main supply is disabled in STANDBY and OFF (the optional
backup supply is kept enabled while the driver is bound).

Note that timepulse-support is not yet implemented.
