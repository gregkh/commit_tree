timekeeping: Prevent false warning when persistent clock is not available

On arches with no persistent clock a message like this is printed during
boot:

[    0.000000] Persistent clock returned invalid value

The value is not invalid: Zero means that no persistent clock is available
and the absence of persistent clock should be quietly accepted.
