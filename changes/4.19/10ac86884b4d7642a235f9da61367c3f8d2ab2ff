fbcon: introduce for_each_registered_fb() helper

Following pattern is often used:

 for (i = 0; i < FB_MAX; i++) {
        if (registered_fb[i]) {
                ...
        }
 }

Therefore, as Andy's suggestion, for_each_registered_fb() helper can
be introduced to make the code easier to read and write by reducing
indentation level. It also saves few lines of code in each occurrence.

This patch convert all part here at the same time.
