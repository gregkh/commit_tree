module: make it clear when we're handling the module copy in info->hdr

In load_module(), it's not always clear whether we're handling the
temporary module copy in info->hdr (which is freed at the end of
load_module()) or if we're handling the module already allocated and
copied to it's final place. Adding an info->mod field and using it
whenever we're handling the temporary copy makes that explicitly clear.
