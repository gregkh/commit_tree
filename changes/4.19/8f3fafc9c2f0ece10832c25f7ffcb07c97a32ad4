cdrom: Fix info leak/OOB read in cdrom_ioctl_drive_status

Like d88b6d04: "cdrom: information leak in cdrom_ioctl_media_changed()"

There is another cast from unsigned long to int which causes
a bounds check to fail with specially crafted input. The value is
then used as an index in the slot array in cdrom_slot_status().
