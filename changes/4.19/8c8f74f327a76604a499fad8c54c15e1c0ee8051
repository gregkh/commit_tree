mfd: 88pm860x-i2c: switch to i2c_lock_bus(..., I2C_LOCK_SEGMENT)

Locking the root adapter for __i2c_transfer will deadlock if the
device sits behind a mux-locked I2C mux. Switch to the finer-grained
i2c_lock_bus with the I2C_LOCK_SEGMENT flag. If the device does not
sit behind a mux-locked mux, the two locking variants are equivalent.
