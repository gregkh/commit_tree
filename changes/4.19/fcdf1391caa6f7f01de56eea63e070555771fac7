ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Remove IN2 input mappings

BYT_RT5651_IN2_MAP was introduced in commit 39712db878a4 ("SoC: intel: byt:
Introduce new custom IN2 map"), uses in commit 2fe30129b0a6 ("ASoC: intel:
byt: Enable IN2 map quirk for a KIANO laptop"), only to be replaced by a
new BYT_RT5651_IN1_IN2_MAP quirk in commit ea261bd02a67 ("ASoC: intel:
byt: Introduce new map for dual mics") quickly afterwards, because the
KIANO laptop has 2 internal mics on IN1 and IN2 and the headset mic is
not in IN1 where the BYT_RT5651_IN2_MAP maps it, but on IN3.

Now that the KIANO quirk entry uses BYT_RT5651_IN1_IN2_MAP, there are no
users of BYT_RT5651_IN2_MAP left. This makes sense since the headset mic
seems to always be connected to IN3, so BYT_RT5651_IN2_MAP is not useful.

To deal with BYT_RT5651_IN2_MAP wrongly mapping the headset mic to IN1,
BYT_RT5651_IN2_HS_IN3_MAP was added in commit f026e0631780 ("ASoC: Intel:
bytcr_rt5651: Add new IN2_HS_IN3 input map and a quirk using it"). This
was based on the assumption then some devices have the internal mic
connected to IN2 only. Further testing has shown that this is wrong and the
internal mic is always connected to IN1 and sometimes to both IN1 and IN2.

TL;DR: Both BYT_RT5651_IN2_MAP and BYT_RT5651_IN2_HS_IN3_MAP are based on
on wrong assumptions from the past and are no longer useful now, so they
can both be removed.
