net: ena: fix driver when PAGE_SIZE == 64kB

The buffer length field in the ena rx descriptor is 16 bit, and the
current driver passes a full page in each ena rx descriptor.
When PAGE_SIZE equals 64kB or more, the buffer length field becomes
zero.
To solve this issue, limit the ena Rx descriptor to use 16kB even
when allocating 64kB kernel pages. This change would not impact ena
device functionality, as 16kB is still larger than maximum MTU.
