nfp: add support for simultaneous driver and hw XDP

Split handling of offloaded and driver programs completely.  Since
offloaded programs always come with XDP_FLAGS_HW_MODE set in reality
there could be no sharing, anyway, programs would only be installed
in driver or in hardware.  Splitting the handling allows us to install
programs in HW and in driver at the same time.
