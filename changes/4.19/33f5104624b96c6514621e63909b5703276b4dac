clk: Add driver for MAX9485

This patch adds a driver for MAX9485, a programmable audio clock generator.

The device requires a 27.000 MHz clock input. It can provide a gated
buffered output of its input clock and two gated outputs of a PLL that can
generate one out of 16 discrete frequencies. There is only one PLL however,
so the two gated outputs will always have the same frequency but they can
be switched individually.

The driver for this device exposes 4 clocks in total:

- MAX9485_MCLKOUT:      A gated, buffered output of the input clock
- MAX9485_CLKOUT:       A PLL that can be configured to 16 different
			discrete frequencies
- MAX9485_CLKOUT[1,2]:  Two gated outputs for MAX9485_CLKOUT

Some PLL output frequencies can be achieved with different register
settings. The driver will select the one with lowest jitter in such cases.
