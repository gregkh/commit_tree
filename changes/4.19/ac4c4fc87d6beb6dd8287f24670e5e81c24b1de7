s390/cmm: avoid add_timer on concurrently used timer

cmm_set_timer could be called concurrently from cmm_thread, cmm proc
handler, upon cmm smsg receive and timer function itself. To avoid
potential race condition and hitting BUG_ON in add_timer on already
pending timer simply reuse mod_timer which is according to
documentation "the only safe way to modify the timeout" with multiple
unserialized concurrent users. mod_timer can handle both active and
inactive timers which allows to carry out minor code simplification as
well.
