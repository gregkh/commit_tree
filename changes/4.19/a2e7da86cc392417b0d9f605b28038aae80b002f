fsi: Add mechanism to set the tSendDelay and tEchoDelay values

Those values control the amount of "dummy" clocks between commands and
between a command and its response.

This adds a way to configure them from sysfs (to be later extended to
defaults in the device-tree). The default remains 16 (the HW default).

This is only supported if the backend supports the new link_config()
callback to configure the generation of those delays.
