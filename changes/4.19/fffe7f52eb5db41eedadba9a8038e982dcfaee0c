regulator: qcom_spmi: Fix warning Bad of_node_put()

For of_find_node_by_name(), you typically pass what the previous call
returned. Therefore, of_find_node_by_name() increases the refcount of
the returned node, and decreases the refcount of the node passed as the
first argument.

of_find_node_by_name() is incorrectly used, and produces a warning.
Fix the warning by using the more suitable function
of_get_child_by_name().

Also add a missing of_node_put() for the returned value, since this was
previously being leaked.
