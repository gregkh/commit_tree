staging: r8822be: Copy existing btcoexist code into staging

The RTL8822BE, an 802.11ac wireless network card, is now appearing in
new computers. Its driver is being placed in staging to reduce the time
that users of this new card will have access to in-kernel drivers.

This commit copies the existing routines from .../rtlwifi/btcoexist/
into staging. There are no changes other than removing all EXPORT
statements, and the fixing of checkpatch messages. The latter will
be backported to the wireless tree.
