drm/i915: Drain the device workqueue on unload

Workers on the i915->wq may rearm themselves so for completeness we need
to replace our flush_workqueue() with a call to drain_workqueue() before
unloading the device.

v2: Reinforce the drain_workqueue with an preceding rcu_barrier() as a
few of the tasks that need to be drained may first be armed by RCU.
