drm/i915: fix backlight invert for non-zero minimum brightness

When we started following the backlight minimum brightness in
6dda730e55f4 ("drm/i915: respect the VBT minimum backlight brightness")
we overlooked the brightness invert quirk. Even if we invert the
brightness, we need to take the min limit into account. We probably
missed this because the invert has only been required on gen4 for proper
operation.
