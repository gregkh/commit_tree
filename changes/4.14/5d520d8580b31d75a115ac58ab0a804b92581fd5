xen/pvcalls: implement the ioworker functions

We have one ioworker per socket. Each ioworker goes through the list of
outstanding read/write requests. Once all requests have been dealt with,
it returns.

We use one atomic counter per socket for "read" operations and one
for "write" operations to keep track of the reads/writes to do.

We also use one atomic counter ("io") per ioworker to keep track of how
many outstanding requests we have in total assigned to the ioworker. The
ioworker finishes when there are none.
