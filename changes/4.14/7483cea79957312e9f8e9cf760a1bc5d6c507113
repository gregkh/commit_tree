ipv6: fib: Unlink replaced routes from their nodes

When a route is deleted its node pointer is set to NULL to indicate it's
no longer linked to its node. Do the same for routes that are replaced.

This will later allow us to test if a route is still in the FIB by
checking its node pointer instead of its reference count.
