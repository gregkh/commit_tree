atm: nicstar: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  22781	    464	    128	  23373	   5b4d	drivers/atm/nicstar.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  22845	    400	    128	  23373	   5b4d	drivers/atm/nicstar.o
