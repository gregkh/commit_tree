media: rc: simplify ir_raw_event_store_edge()

Since commit 12749b198fa4 ("[media] rc: saa7134: add trailing space for
timely decoding"), the workaround of inserting reset events is no
longer needed.

Note that the initial reset is not needed either; other rc-core drivers
that don't use ir_raw_event_store_edge() never call this at all.

Verified on a HVR-1150 and Raspberry Pi.
