netvsc: no need to allocate send/receive on numa node

The send and receive buffers are both per-device (not per-channel).
The associated NUMA node is a property of the CPU which is per-channel
therefore it makes no sense to force the receive/send buffer to be
allocated on a particular node (since it is a shared resource).
