drm/i915/gen10: implement gen 10 watermarks calculations

They're slightly different than the gen 9 calculations.

v2: Remove TODO comment. Code matches recent spec.
v3: Rebase on top of latest skl code using new fp16.16 and
    fixing a logic issue. Auto rebase bot has apparently
    made some bad decisions that changed the logic of the
    code. (Noticed by Manesh, updated by Rodrigo).
