PCI: Mark Broadcom HT2100 Root Port Extended Tags as broken

Per PCIe r3.1, sec 2.2.6.2 and 7.8.4, a Requester may not use 8-bit Tags
unless its Extended Tag Field Enable is set, but all Receivers/Completers
must handle 8-bit Tags correctly regardless of their Extended Tag Field
Enable.

Some devices do not handle 8-bit Tags as Completers, so add a quirk for
them.  If we find such a device, we disable Extended Tags for the entire
hierarchy to make peer-to-peer DMA possible.

The Broadcom HT2100 seems to have issues with handling 8-bit tags.  Mark it
as broken.

The pci_walk_bus() in the quirk handles devices we've enumerated in the
past, and pci_configure_device() handles devices we enumerate in the
future.
