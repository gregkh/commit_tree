ASoC: compress: Set reasonable compress id string

For dynamic compress rtd, the codec_dai may not have any actual
meaning(like snd-soc-dummy-dai), so compress id can just use the
value of dai_link->stream_name. But for others, its codec_dai
has actual meaning, so compress id can include codec_dai name.
