platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Fix warning about deprecated hwmon_device_register

Use hwmon_device_register_with_groups instead of deprecated
hwmon_device_register and fix a dmesg warning.

This patch however changes the userspace API.
hwmon_device_register_with_groups takes `hwmon' name as an argument and
creates a name file in the `hwmon' device, not in the `platform_device'.
This allows us to remove custom `name' device attribute, but in order to
make lm-sensors happy we also have to move fans and thermal attributes
to the `hwmon' device.

Even though this patch changes userspace API, it's still compatible with
the lm-sensors. Starting with lm-sensors 3.0 (circa 2007), it looks at
both hwmon and the backing device for the name and other attributes.
