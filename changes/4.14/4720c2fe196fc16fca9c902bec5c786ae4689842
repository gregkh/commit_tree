ASoC: samsung: i2s: Support more resolution rates

This driver can support more frequencies over 96KHz. There are no reasons
to limit the frequency range below 96KHz. If codecs/amps or something else
can't support higher resolution rates, the constraints would be set rates
properly because each drivers have its own limits.

I added the 'pcm_rates' field to the dai_data to be set rates by the
compatibilities. As a result, rates will be set each devices respectively.
For example of exynos5433, rates will be set from 8KHz to 192KHz.
