IB/core: Set RoCEv2 MGID according to spec

RoCEv2 Annex states that for RoCEv2 over IPv4, the corresponding
IPv4 address is encoded into the GID according to the following rule:
GID= :ffff:<IPv4 address>

Remove the 0xff0e prefix for RoCEv2 packets with IPv4 and leave it
zeroed and change rdma_is_multicast_addr() to consider the new logic.
