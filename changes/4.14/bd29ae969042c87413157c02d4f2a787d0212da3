ASoC: jack: Manage gpios via devres

Let's be lazy -- this patch adds the devres code to
snd_soc_jack_add_gpios() for releasing the gpio resources at device
removal automagically.  After this patch, you don't have to call
snd_soc_jack_free_gpios() manually as long as it's managed from the
machine driver.

What about the gpios assigned in other levels?  Well, you might still
need to free the resources manually, depending on how the component
unbind works.
