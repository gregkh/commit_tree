sctp: remove the typedef sctp_unrecognized_param_t

This patch is to remove the typedef sctp_unrecognized_param_t, and
replace with struct sctp_unrecognized_param in the places where it's
using this typedef.

It is also to fix some indents in sctp_sf_do_unexpected_init() and
sctp_sf_do_5_1B_init().
