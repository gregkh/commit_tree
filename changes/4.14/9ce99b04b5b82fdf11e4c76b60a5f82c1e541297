staging: r8822be: Add phydm mini driver

The RTL8822BE, an 802.11ac wireless network card, is now appearing in
new computers. Its driver is being placed in staging to reduce the time
that users of this new card will have access to in-kernel drivers.

New Realtek wireless devices have a new method for PHY control and
dynamic management. The RTL8822BE is the first of these devices, thus
there is additional code required.

In the final version, this code will be a separate module; however,
it is combined with the r8822be driver to minimize the interference
with the drivers in the wireless tree.
