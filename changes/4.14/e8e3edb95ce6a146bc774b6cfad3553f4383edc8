mtd: create per-device and module-scope debugfs entries

Several MTD devices are using debugfs entries created in the root.
This commit provides the means for a standardized subtree, creating
one "mtd" entry at root, and one entry per device inside it, named
after the device.
The tree is registered in add_mtd_device, and released in
del_mtd_device.
Devices docg3, mtdswap and nandsim were updated to use this subtree
instead of custom ones, and their entries were prefixed with the
drivers' names.
