driver core: platform: Don't read past the end of "driver_override" buffer

When printing the driver_override parameter when it is 4095 and 4094 bytes
long, the printing code would access invalid memory because we need count+1
bytes for printing.

Reject driver_override values of these lengths in driver_override_store().

This is in close analogy to commit 4efe874aace5 ("PCI: Don't read past the
end of sysfs "driver_override" buffer") from Sasha Levin.
