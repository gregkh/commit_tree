powerpc: Fix emulation of the isel instruction

The case added for the isel instruction was added inside a switch
statement which uses the 10-bit minor opcode field in the 0x7fe
bits of the instruction word.  However, for the isel instruction,
the minor opcode field is only the 0x3e bits, and the 0x7c0 bits
are used for the "BC" field, which indicates which CR bit to use
to select the result.

Therefore, for the isel emulation to work correctly when BC != 0,
we need to match on ((instr >> 1) & 0x1f) == 15).  To do this, we
pull the isel case out of the switch statement and put it in an
if statement of its own.
