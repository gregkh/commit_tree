sched/fair: Call cpufreq update util handlers less frequently on UP

For SMP systems, update_load_avg() calls the cpufreq update util
handlers only for the top level cfs_rq (i.e. rq->cfs).

But that is not the case for UP systems. update_load_avg() calls util
handler for any cfs_rq for which it is called. This would result in way
too many calls from the scheduler to the cpufreq governors when
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED is enabled.

Reduce the frequency of these calls by copying the behavior from the SMP
case, i.e. Only call util handlers for the top level cfs_rq.
