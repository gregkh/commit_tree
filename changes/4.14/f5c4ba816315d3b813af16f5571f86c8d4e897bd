cifs: release auth_key.response for reconnect.

There is a race that cause cifs reconnect in cifs_mount,
- cifs_mount
  - cifs_get_tcp_session
    - [ start thread cifs_demultiplex_thread
      - cifs_read_from_socket: -ECONNABORTED
        - DELAY_WORK smb2_reconnect_server ]
  - cifs_setup_session
  - [ smb2_reconnect_server ]

auth_key.response was allocated in cifs_setup_session, and
will release when the session destoried. So when session re-
connect, auth_key.response should be check and released.

Tested with my system:
CIFS VFS: Free previous auth_key.response = ffff8800320bbf80

A simple auth_key.response allocation call trace:
- cifs_setup_session
- SMB2_sess_setup
- SMB2_sess_auth_rawntlmssp_authenticate
- build_ntlmssp_auth_blob
- setup_ntlmv2_rsp
