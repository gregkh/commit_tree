hv_netvsc: fix send buffer failure on MTU change

If MTU is changed the host would reject the send buffer change.
This problem is result of recent change to allow changing send
buffer size.

Every time we change the MTU, we store the previous net_device section
count before destroying the buffer, but we donâ€™t store the previous
section size. When we reinitialize the buffer, its size is calculated
by multiplying the previous count and previous size. Since we
continuously increase the MTU, the host returns us a decreasing count
value while the section size is reinitialized to 1728 bytes every
time.

This eventually leads to a condition where the calculated buf_size is
so small that the host rejects it.
