iio: adc: Fix polling of INA219 conversion ready flag

While the INA226 has a conversion ready flag (CVRF) in the R/W Mask/Enable
register with read-to-clear semantics, the corresponding bit of the INA219
(CNVR) is part of the bus voltage register. The flag is cleared by reading
the power register.
