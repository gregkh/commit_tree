mmc: mmci: stop building qcom dml as module

It does not make sense for qcom dml code to be a seperate module, as
this has just 2 helper functions specific to qcom, and used directly by
mmci driver, so just compile this along with main mmci driver.

This would also fix issues arrising due to Kconfig combinations between
mmci and qcom dml.
