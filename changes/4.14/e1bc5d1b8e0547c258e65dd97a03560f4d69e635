arm64: Handle trapped DC CVAP

Cache clean to PoP is subject to the same access controls as to PoC, so
if we are trapping userspace cache maintenance with SCTLR_EL1.UCI, we
need to be prepared to handle it. To avoid getting into complicated
fights with binutils about ARMv8.2 options, we'll just cheat and use the
raw SYS instruction rather than the 'proper' DC alias.
