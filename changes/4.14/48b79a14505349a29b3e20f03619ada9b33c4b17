PCI: shpchp: Enable bridge bus mastering if MSI is enabled

An SHPC may generate MSIs to notify software about slot or controller
events (SHPC spec r1.0, sec 4.7).  A PCI device can only generate an MSI if
it has bus mastering enabled.

Enable bus mastering if the bridge contains an SHPC that uses MSI for event
notifications.
