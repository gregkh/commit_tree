apparmor: Fix an error code in aafs_create()

We accidentally forgot to set the error code on this path.  It means we
return NULL instead of an error pointer.  I looked through a bunch of
callers and I don't think it really causes a big issue, but the
documentation says we're supposed to return error pointers here.
