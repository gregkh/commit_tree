i40e: Fix memory leak related filter programming status

It looks like we weren't correctly placing the pages from buffers that had
been used to return a filter programming status back on the ring. As a
result they were being overwritten and tracking of the pages was lost.

This change works to correct that by incorporating part of
i40e_put_rx_buffer into the programming status handler code. As a result we
should now be correctly placing the pages for those buffers on the
re-allocation list instead of letting them stay in place.
