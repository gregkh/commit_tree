scsi: aacraid: Fix controller initialization failure

This is a fix to an issue where the driver sends its periodic WELLNESS
command to the controller after the driver shut it down.This causes the
controller to crash. The window where this can happen is small, but it
can be hit at around 4 hours of constant resets.
