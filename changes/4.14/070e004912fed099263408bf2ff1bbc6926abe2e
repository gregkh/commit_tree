powerpc/4xx: Fix compile error with 64K pages on 40x, 44x

The mmu context on the 40x, 44x does not define pte_frag entry. This
causes gcc abort the compilation due to:

  setup-common.c: In function ‘setup_arch’:
  setup-common.c:908: error: ‘mm_context_t’ has no ‘pte_frag’

This patch fixes the issue by removing the pte_frag initialization in
setup-common.c.

This is possible, because the compiler will do the initialization,
since the mm_context is a sub struct of init_mm. init_mm is declared
in mm_types.h as external linkage.

According to C99 6.2.4.3:
  An object whose identifier is declared with external linkage
  [...] has static storage duration.

C99 defines in 6.7.8.10 that:
  If an object that has static storage duration is not
  initialized explicitly, then:
  - if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer
