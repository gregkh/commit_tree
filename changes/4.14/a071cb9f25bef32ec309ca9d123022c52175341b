net/mlx5e: Non-atomic RQ state indicator for UMR WQE in progress

The indication for a UMR WQE in progress is needed only within
the NAPI context, and hence no races possible and no need for
the use of atomic operations.
The only place the flag is read outside of NAPI context is
in closure flow, after RQ is disabled flag is no more accessed
in NAPI.
Use a boolean instead of a bit in ring state, so that its
non-atomic set operations do not race with the atomic sets of
the other bits.
