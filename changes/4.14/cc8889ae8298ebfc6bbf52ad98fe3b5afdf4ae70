doc: document MSG_ZEROCOPY

Documentation for this feature was missing from the patchset.
Copied a lot from the netdev 2.1 paper, addressing some small
interface changes since then.

Changes
  v1 -> v2
    - change email discussion URL format
    - clarify that u32 counter is per-syscall, unsigned and
      wraps after UINT_MAX calls
    - describe errno on send failure specific to MSG_ZEROCOPY
    - a few very minor rewordings
