media: fix warning on v4l2_subdev_call() result interpreted as bool

v4l2_subdev_call is a macro returning whatever the callback return
type is, usually 'int'. With gcc-7 and ccache, this can lead to
many wanings like:

media/platform/pxa_camera.c: In function 'pxa_mbus_build_fmts_xlate':
media/platform/pxa_camera.c:766:27: error: ?: using integer constants in boolean context [-Werror=int-in-bool-context]
  while (!v4l2_subdev_call(subdev, pad, enum_mbus_code, NULL, &code)) {
media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/atomisp_cmd.c: In function 'atomisp_s_ae_window':
media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/atomisp_cmd.c:6414:52: error: ?: using integer constants in boolean context [-Werror=int-in-bool-context]
  if (v4l2_subdev_call(isp->inputs[asd->input_curr].camera,

The problem here is that after preprocessing, we the compiler
sees a variation of

	if (a ? 0 : 2)

that it thinks is suspicious.

This replaces the ?: operator with an different expression that
does the same thing in a more easily readable way that cannot
tigger the warning
