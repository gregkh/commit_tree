iio: adc: ti-ads1015: enable conversion when CONFIG_PM is not set

The ADS1015 device have two operating modes, continuous conversion mode
and single-shot mode.  This driver assumes that the continuous conversion
mode is selected by runtime resume callback when the ADC result is
requested.

If CONFIG_PM is disabled, the device is always in the default single-shot
mode and no one begins a single conversion.  So the conversion register
doesn't contain valid ADC result.  Fix it by changing the continuous mode
in probe function.
