drm/doc: Improve ioctl/fops docs a bit more

I spotted a markup issue, plus adding the descriptions in drm_driver.
Plus a few more links while at it.

I'm still mildly unhappy with the split between fops and ioctls, but I
still think having the ioctls in the uapi chapter makes more sense. Oh
well ...

v2: Rebase.

v3: Move misplace hunk to the right patch.
