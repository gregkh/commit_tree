mm, page_alloc: do not set_cpu_numa_mem on empty nodes initialization

__build_all_zonelists reinitializes each online cpu local node for
CONFIG_HAVE_MEMORYLESS_NODES.  This makes sense because previously
memory less nodes could gain some memory during memory hotplug and so
the local node should be changed for CPUs close to such a node.  It
makes less sense to do that unconditionally for a newly creaded NUMA
node which is still offline and without any memory.

Let's also simplify the cpu loop and use for_each_online_cpu instead of
an explicit cpu_online check for all possible cpus.
