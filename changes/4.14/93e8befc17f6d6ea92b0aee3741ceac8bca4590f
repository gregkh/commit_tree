xfs: handle error if xfs_btree_get_bufs fails

Jason reported that a corrupted filesystem failed to replay
the log with a metadata block out of bounds warning:

XFS (dm-2): _xfs_buf_find: Block out of range: block 0x80270fff8, EOFS 0x9c40000

_xfs_buf_find() and xfs_btree_get_bufs() return NULL if
that happens, and then when xfs_alloc_fix_freelist() calls
xfs_trans_binval() on that NULL bp, we oops with:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000000f8

We don't handle _xfs_buf_find errors very well, every
caller higher up the stack gets to guess at why it failed.
But we should at least handle it somehow, so return
EFSCORRUPTED here.
