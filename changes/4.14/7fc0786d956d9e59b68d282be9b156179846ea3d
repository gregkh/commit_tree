KEYS: fix key refcount leak in keyctl_read_key()

In keyctl_read_key(), if key_permission() were to return an error code
other than EACCES, we would leak a the reference to the key.  This can't
actually happen currently because key_permission() can only return an
error code other than EACCES if security_key_permission() does, only
SELinux and Smack implement that hook, and neither can return an error
code other than EACCES.  But it should still be fixed, as it is a bug
waiting to happen.
