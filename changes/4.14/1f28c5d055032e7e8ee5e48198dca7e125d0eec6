autofs: remove unused AUTOFS_IOC_EXPIRE_DIRECT/INDIRECT

These are not used by either kernel or userspace, although
AUTOFS_IOC_EXPIRE_DIRECT once seems to have been used by userspace in
around 2006-2008, which was technically just an alias of the existing
ioctl AUTOFS_IOC_EXPIRE_MULTI.

ioctls for autofs are already complicated enough that they could be
removed unless these are staying here to be able to compile userspace code
of certain period of time from a decade ago.

Edit: raven@themaw.net
Yes, this is indeed very old and anything that still uses must
be updated becuase it will be using broken functionality.
