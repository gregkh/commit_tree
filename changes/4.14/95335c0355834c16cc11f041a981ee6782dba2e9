rcu: Check for NOCB CPUs and empty lists earlier in CB migration

The current CPU-hotplug RCU-callback-migration code checks
for the source (newly offlined) CPU being a NOCBs CPU down in
rcu_send_cbs_to_orphanage().  This commit simplifies callback migration a
bit by moving this check up to rcu_migrate_callbacks().  This commit also
adds a check for the source CPU having no callbacks, which eases analysis
of the rcu_send_cbs_to_orphanage() and rcu_adopt_orphan_cbs() functions.
