media: s5p-jpeg: Clear JPEG_CODEC_ON bits in sw reset function

Bits EXYNOS4_DEC_MODE and EXYNOS4_ENC_MODE do not get cleared
on software reset. These bits need to be cleared explicitly.

Even though the bits in question are already cleared in interrupt
service routine, the reset should also clear them in case when
e.g. bootloader uses the codec and leaves it in a bad state.
