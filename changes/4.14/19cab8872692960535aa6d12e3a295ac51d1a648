net: ethtool: Add back transceiver type

Commit 3f1ac7a700d0 ("net: ethtool: add new ETHTOOL_xLINKSETTINGS API")
deprecated the ethtool_cmd::transceiver field, which was fine in
premise, except that the PHY library was actually using it to report the
type of transceiver: internal or external.

Use the first word of the reserved field to put this __u8 transceiver
field back in. It is made read-only, and we don't expect the
ETHTOOL_xLINKSETTINGS API to be doing anything with this anyway, so this
is mostly for the legacy path where we do:

ethtool_get_settings()
-> dev->ethtool_ops->get_link_ksettings()
   -> convert_link_ksettings_to_legacy_settings()

to have no information loss compared to the legacy get_settings API.
