ip_gre: set tunnel hlen properly in erspan_tunnel_init

According to __gre_tunnel_init, tunnel->hlen should be set as the
headers' length between inner packet and outer iphdr.

It would be used especially to calculate a proper mtu when updating
mtu in tnl_update_pmtu. Now without setting it, a bigger mtu value
than expected would be updated, which hurts performance a lot.

This patch is to fix it by setting tunnel->hlen with:
   tunnel->tun_hlen + tunnel->encap_hlen + sizeof(struct erspanhdr)
