net: bonding: fix tlb_dynamic_lb default value

Commit 8b426dc54cf4 ("bonding: remove hardcoded value") changed the
default value for tlb_dynamic_lb which lead to either broken ALB mode
(since tlb_dynamic_lb can be changed only in TLB) or setting TLB mode
with tlb_dynamic_lb equal to 0.
The first issue was recently fixed by setting tlb_dynamic_lb to 1 always
when switching to ALB mode, but the default value is still wrong and
we'll enter TLB mode with tlb_dynamic_lb equal to 0 if the mode is
changed via netlink or sysfs. In order to restore the previous behaviour
and default value simply remove the mode check around the default param
initialization for tlb_dynamic_lb which will always set it to 1 as
before.
