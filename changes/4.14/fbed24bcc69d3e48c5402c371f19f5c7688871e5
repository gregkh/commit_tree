inet: fix improper empty comparison

When doing my reuseport rework I screwed up and changed a

if (hlist_empty(&tb->owners))

to

if (!hlist_empty(&tb->owners))

This is obviously bad as all of the reuseport/reuse logic was reversed,
which caused weird problems like allowing an ipv4 bind conflict if we
opened an ipv4 only socket on a port followed by an ipv6 only socket on
the same port.
