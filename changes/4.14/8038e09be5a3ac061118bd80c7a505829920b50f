drm/crc: Only open CRC on atomic drivers when the CRTC is active.

Commit e8fa5671183c ("drm: crc: Wait for a frame before returning
from open()") adds a wait for CRC frame, but with the CRTC off
this will never be generated. For atomic drivers we know if a CRTC
is active through crtc_state->active, so when inactive reject the
open with -EIO.

Just like with the previous patch changing debugfs opening semantics,
this patch has been tested against igt.
