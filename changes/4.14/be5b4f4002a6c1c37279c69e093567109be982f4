ath10k: push peer type to target for TDLS peers

WMI interface for all the firmwares(except QCA6174) does not include the
type of peer(default/bss/tdls) requested during peer creation, therefore
target creates a default peer.

TDLS implementation on 10.4 firmware requires host to configure the
peer type(tdls) for TDLS peers. This patch adds peer type parameter to the
existing WMI interface for peer creation to accommodate this requirement.

Tested this change on QCA9888(10.4-3.5.1-00018) and QCA988x(10.2.4.70.9-2)
with ping tests for AP/STA modes.
