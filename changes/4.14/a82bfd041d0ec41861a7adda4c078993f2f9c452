perf ui progress: Fix progress update

We currently update the 'next' variable only with a single step value.
But it's possible the 'adv' update is bigger than single 'step' value.
This would leave 'next' value under counted and force unnecessary
ui_progress__ops->update calls.

Calculate the amount of steps we need for 'adv' update and increase the
'next' with that amounts of steps.
