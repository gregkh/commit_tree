xprtrdma: Refactor rpcrdma_reply_handler()

Refactor the reply handler's transport header decoding logic to make
it easier to understand and update.

Convert some of the handler to use xdr_streams, which will enable
stricter validation of input data and enable the eventual addition
of support for new combinations of chunks, such as "Write + Reply"
or "PZRC + normal Read".
