PM / OPP: OF: Use pr_debug() instead of pr_err() while adding OPP table

Some platforms add the OPPs dynamically from platform specific drivers
instead of getting them statically from DT. The cpufreq-dt driver
already ignores the return value of dev_pm_opp_of_cpumask_add_table() to
not error out for such cases, but we still end up printing error message
from that routine. That's not nice.

Convert the print message to use pr_debug() instead.
