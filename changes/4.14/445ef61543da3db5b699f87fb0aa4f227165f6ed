usb: musb: Check for host-mode using is_host_active() on reset interrupt

The sunxi musb has a bug where sometimes it will generate a babble
error on device disconnect instead of a disconnect IRQ. When this
happens the musb controller switches from host mode to device mode
(it clears MUSB_DEVCTL_HM/MUSB_DEVCTL_SESSION and sets
MUSB_DEVCTL_BDEVICE) and gets stuck in this state.

The babble error is misdetected as a bus reset because MUSB_DEVCTL_HM
was cleared.

To fix this, use is_host_active() rather than (devctl & MUSB_DEVCTL_HM)
to detect babble error so that sunxi musb babble recovery can handle it
by restoring the mode. This information is provided by the driver logic
and does not rely on register contents.
