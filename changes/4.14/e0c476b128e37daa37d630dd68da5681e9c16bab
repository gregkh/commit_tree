btrfs: backref, cleanup __ namespace abuse

We typically use __ to indicate a helper routine that shouldn't be
called directly without understanding the proper context required
to do so.  We use static functions to indicate that a function is
private to a particular C file.  The backref code uses static
function and __ prefixes on nearly everything, which makes the code
difficult to read and establishes a pattern for future code that
shouldn't be followed.  This patch drops all the unnecessary prefixes.
