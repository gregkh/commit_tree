mmc: dw_mmc: move controller reset before driver init

This commit modifies dw_mci_probe(), it moves reset assertion before
drv_data->init(host)

Some driver needs to access controller registers in its .init() ops. So,
in order to make such access safe, we should do controller reset before
.init() being called.
