v4l: vsp1: Add support for the BRS entity

The Blend/ROP Sub Unit (BRS) is a stripped-down version of the BRU found
in several VSP2 instances. Compared to a regular BRU, it supports two
inputs only, and thus has no ROP unit.

Add support for the BRS by modelling it as a new entity type, but reuse
the vsp1_bru object underneath. Chaining the BRU and BRS entities seems
to be supported by the hardware but isn't implemented yet as it isn't
the primary use case for the BRS.
