staging: lustre: uapi: move lu_fid, ost_id funcs out of lustre_idl.h

Move lu_fid functions into lustre/lustre_fid.h
Move ost_id functions into lustre/lustre_ostid.h
Fix indenting, include new headers as needed.

Several inline functions in the header lustre_ostid.h
are using debug macros instead of returning proper errors.
Remove the debug macros and properly handle the returned
error codes. Place both UAPI headers lustre_fid.h and
lustre_ostid.h into the uapi directory.
