ASoC: qcom: Remove useless function call

The function platform_set_drvdata(pdev, data) copies the value of
the variable data to pdev->dev.driver_data,but when calling
snd_soc_register_card,the function dev_set_drvdata(card->dev, card)
will override it, so i think that the former copy operation is
useless and can be removed.
