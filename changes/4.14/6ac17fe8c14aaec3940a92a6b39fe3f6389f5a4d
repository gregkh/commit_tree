mailbox: bcm-flexrm-mailbox: Set IRQ affinity hint for FlexRM ring IRQs

This patch set IRQ affinity hint for FlexRM ring IRQ at time of
enabling ring (i.e. flexrm_startup()). The IRQ affinity hint will
allow FlexRM driver to distribute FlexRM ring IRQs across online
CPUs so that all FlexRM ring IRQs don't land in CPU0 by default.
