drm/atomic: initial support for asynchronous plane update

In some cases, like cursor updates, it is interesting to update the
plane in an asynchronous fashion to avoid big delays. The current queued
update could be still waiting for a fence to signal and thus block any
subsequent update until its scan out. In cases like this if we update the
cursor synchronously through the atomic API it will cause significant
delays that would even be noticed by the final user.

This patch creates a fast path to jump ahead the current queued state and
do single planes updates without going through all atomic steps in
drm_atomic_helper_commit(). We take this path for legacy cursor updates.

For now only single plane updates are supported, but we plan to support
multiple planes updates and async PageFlips through this interface as well
in the near future.

v6:	- move check code to drm_atomic_helper.c (Daniel Vetter)

v5:
	- improve comments (Eric Anholt)

v4:
	- fix state->crtc NULL check (Archit Taneja)

v3:
	- fix iteration on the wrong crtc state
	- put back code to forbid updates if there is a queued update for
	the same plane (Ville Syrjälä)
	- move size checks back to drivers (Ville Syrjälä)
	- move ASYNC_UPDATE flag addition to its own patch (Ville Syrjälä)

v2:
	- allow updates even if there is a queued update for the same
	plane.
