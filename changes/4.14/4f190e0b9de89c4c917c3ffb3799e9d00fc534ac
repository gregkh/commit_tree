USB: musb: fix session-bit runtime-PM quirk

The current session-bit quirk implementation does not prevent the retry
counter from underflowing, something which could break runtime PM and
keep the device active for a very long time (about 2^32 seconds) after a
disconnect.

This notably breaks the B-device timeout case, but could potentially
cause problems also when the controller is operating as an A-device.
