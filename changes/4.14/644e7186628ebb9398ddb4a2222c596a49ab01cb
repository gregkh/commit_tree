clk: si5351: expand compatible strings in documentation

checkpatch.pl doesn't know how to expand "silabs,si5351{a,a-msop,b,c}"
and so generates warnings about si5351-compatible devices appearing to
be un-documented. Resolve this by documenting the compatible options
supported by the clk-si5351 driver individually.
