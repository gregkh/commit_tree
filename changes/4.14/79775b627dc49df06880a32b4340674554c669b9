drm/amdkfd: Consolidate and clean up log commands

Consolidate log commands so that dev_info(NULL, "Error...") uses the more
accurate pr_err, remove the module name from the log (can be seen via
dynamic debugging with +m), and the function name (can be seen via
dynamic debugging with +f). We also don't need debug messages saying
what function we're in. Those can be added by devs when needed

Don't print vendor and device ID in error messages. They are typically
the same for all GPUs in a multi-GPU system. So this doesn't add any
value to the message.

Lastly, remove parentheses around %d, %i and 0x%llX.
According to kernel.org:
"Printing numbers in parentheses (%d) adds no value and should be
avoided."
