drm/fb-helper: pass physical dimensions to fbdev

The fbdev subsystem has a place for physical dimensions (width and height
in mm) that is readable by userspace. Since DRM also knows these
dimensions, pass this information to the fbdev device.

This has to be done in drm_setup_crtcs_fb() instead of drm_setup_crtcs()
because fb_helper->fbdev may be NULL in drm_setup_crtcs().
