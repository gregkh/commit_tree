ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix DSP core ref count for init failure

During dsp init failure, the ref count is not incremented and dsp is
powered down. But as the skl driver calls put_core for the init failure it
decrements the dsp core ref count and ref count becomes unbalanced.

This results in dsp core powered up in further runtime suspend/resume
cycles and never powered down.

So increment the ref count before dsp core powerup and for any failure,
decrement in put_core will be balanced.
