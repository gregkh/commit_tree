powerpc/oops: Print the kernel's endian in the oops

Although the MSR tells you what endian you're in it's possible that
isn't the same endian the kernel was built for, and if that happens
you're usually having a very bad day. So print a marker to make
it 100% clear which endian the kernel was built for.
