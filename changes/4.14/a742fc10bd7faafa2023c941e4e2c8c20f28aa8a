thermal: int340x_thermal: Constify attribute_group structures.

attribute_groups are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_groups provided by <linux/sysfs.h> work
with const attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   3152	   1096	      8	   4256	   10a0	processor_thermal_device.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   3216	   1032	      8	   4256	   10a0	processor_thermal_device.o
