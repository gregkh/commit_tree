tracing: Erase irqsoff trace with empty write

One convenient way to erase trace is "echo > trace". However, this
is currently broken if the current tracer is irqsoff tracer. This
is because irqsoff tracer use max_buffer as the default trace
buffer.

Set the max_buffer as the one to be cleared when it's the trace
buffer currently in use.
