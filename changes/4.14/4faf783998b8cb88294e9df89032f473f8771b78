tcp: fix cwnd undo in Reno and HTCP congestion controls

Using ssthresh to revert cwnd is less reliable when ssthresh is
bounded to 2 packets. This patch uses an existing variable in TCP
"prior_cwnd" that snapshots the cwnd right before entering fast
recovery and RTO recovery in Reno.  This fixes the issue discussed
in netdev thread: "A buggy behavior for Linux TCP Reno and HTCP"
