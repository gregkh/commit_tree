irqchip/gic-v3-its: Move pending doorbell after VMOVP

After moving a VPE from a redistributor to another, we're still left
with a potential pending doorbell interrupt on the old redistributor.
That interrupt should be moved to the new one to be either cleared
or take, depending on what the hypervisor wishes to do.

So let's move it right after having execited VMOVP. This doesn't
add much cost in the !DirectLPI case (we trade a DISCARD for a MOVI),
and the cost of the DIRECTLPI case should be minimal (two extra MMIO
accesses).
