drm/msm: Handle drm_atomic_helper_swap_state failure

drm_atomic_helper_swap_state() will be changed to interruptible waiting
in the next few commits, so all drivers have to be changed to handling
failure.

MSM has its own busy tracking, which means the swap_state call can be
done with stall = false, in which case it should never return an error.
Handle failure with BUG_ON for this reason.
