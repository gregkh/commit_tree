bpf: remove mark access for SK_SKB program types

The skb->mark field is a union with reserved_tailroom which is used
in the TCP code paths from stream memory allocation. Allowing SK_SKB
programs to set this field creates a conflict with future code
optimizations, such as "gifting" the skb to the egress path instead
of creating a new skb and doing a memcpy.

Because we do not have a released version of SK_SKB yet lets just
remove it for now. A more appropriate scratch pad to use at the
socket layer is dev_scratch, but lets add that in future kernels
when needed.
