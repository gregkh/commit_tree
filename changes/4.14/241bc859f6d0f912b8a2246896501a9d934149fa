mlxsw: spectrum_router: Set abort trap in all virtual routers

When the abort mechanism is invoked a default route directing packets to
the CPU is programmed in all the virtual routers currently in use. This
can result in packet loss in case a new VRF is configured.

Upon abort, program the default route in all virtual routers, whether
they are in use or not.

The patch is directed at net-next since post-abort fixes aren't critical
and packet loss due to a missing default route will be insignificant
compared to packet loss caused by the CPU port policer.
