net_sched: get rid of tcfa_rcu

gen estimator has been rewritten in commit 1c0d32fde5bd
("net_sched: gen_estimator: complete rewrite of rate estimators"),
the caller is no longer needed to wait for a grace period.
So this patch gets rid of it.

This also completely closes a race condition between action free
path and filter chain add/remove path for the following patch.
Because otherwise the nested RCU callback can't be caught by
rcu_barrier().

Please see also the comments in code.
