l2tp: check ps->sock before running pppol2tp_session_ioctl()

When pppol2tp_session_ioctl() is called by pppol2tp_tunnel_ioctl(),
the session may be unconnected. That is, it was created by
pppol2tp_session_create() and hasn't been connected with
pppol2tp_connect(). In this case, ps->sock is NULL, so we need to check
for this case in order to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.
