net/mlx5: Add CONFIG_MLX5_ESWITCH Kconfig

Allow to selectively build the driver with or without sriov eswitch, VF
representors and TC offloads.

Also remove the need of two ndo ops structures (sriov & basic)
and keep only one unified ndo ops, compile out VF SRIOV ndos when not
needed (MLX5_ESWITCH=n), and for VF netdev calling those ndos will result
in returning -EPERM.
