ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb: nanopi-k2: add card regulator settle times

Changing the card voltage on the nanopi-k2 is not instantaneous,
especially when switching from 3.3v to 1.8v.

It take at least 3ms for the regulator to go from 3.3v to 1.8v. Add
margin to that to make sure we don't upset the sdcard during the voltage
switch
