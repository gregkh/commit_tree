drm: omapdrm: hdmi: Configure the PHY from the HDMI core version

The OMAP4 and OMAP5 HDMI PHYs have different properties that require
specific handling in the HDMI PHY driver. This needs knowledge of the
PHY version, which is currently inferred from the DSS version. As part
of the effort to remove usage of the DSS version, use the HDMI
controller version instead.
