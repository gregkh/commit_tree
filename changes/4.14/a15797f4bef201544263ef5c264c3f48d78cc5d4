libnvdimm, nfit: export an 'ecc_unit_size' sysfs attribute

When the nfit driver initializes it runs an ARS (Address Range Scrub)
operation across every pmem range. Part of that process involves
determining the ARS capabilities of a given address range. One of the
capabilities that is reported is the 'Clear Uncorrectable Error Range
Length Unit Size' (see: ACPI 6.2 section 9.20.7.4 Function Index 1 -
Query ARS Capabilities). This property is of interest to userspace
software as it indicates the boundary at which the NVDIMM may need to
perform read-modify-write cycles to maintain ECC blocks.
