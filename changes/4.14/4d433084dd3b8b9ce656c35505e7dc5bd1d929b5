i40e: fix odd formatting and indent

The compiler warned on an oddly indented bit of code, and when
investigating that, noted that the functions themselves had
an odd flow. The if condition was checked, and would exclude
a call to AQ, but then the aq_ret would be checked unconditionally
which just looks really weird, and is likely to cause objections.
