percpu: fix starting offset for chunk statistics traversal

This patch fixes the starting offset used when scanning chunks to
compute the chunk statistics. The value start_offset (and end_offset)
are managed in bytes while the traversal occurs over bits. Thus for the
reserved and dynamic chunk, it may incorrectly skip over the initial
allocations.
