KVM: x86: fix use of L1 MMIO areas in nested guests

There is currently some confusion between nested and L1 GPAs.  The
assignment to "direct" in kvm_mmu_page_fault tries to fix that, but
it is not enough.  What this patch does is fence off the MMIO cache
completely when using shadow nested page tables, since we have neither
a GVA nor an L1 GPA to put in the cache.  This also allows some
simplifications in kvm_mmu_page_fault and FNAME(page_fault).

The EPT misconfig likewise does not have an L1 GPA to pass to
kvm_io_bus_write, so that must be skipped for guest mode.
