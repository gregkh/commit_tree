media: ddbridge: bump ddbridge code to version 0.9.29

This huge patch bumps the ddbridge driver to version 0.9.29. Compared to
the vendor driver package, DD OctoNET including GTL link support, and all
DVB-C Modulator card support has been removed since this requires large
changes to the underlying DVB core API, which should eventually be done
separately, and, after that, the functionality/device support can be added
back rather easy.

While the diff is rather large, the bump is mostly a big refactor of all
data structures. Yet, the MSI support (message signaled interrupts) is
greatly improved, also all currently available CI single/duo bridge cards
are fully supported.

More changes compared to the upstream driver:
 - the DDB_USE_WORKER flag/define was removed, kernel worker functionality
   will be used.
 - coding style is properly fixed (zero complaints from checkpatch)
 - all (not much though) CamelCase has been fixed to kernel_case
 - (private) IOCTLs temporarily removed (which are mainly used to provide
   rarely-used FPGA update functionality)

Great care has been taken to keep all previous changes and fixes (e.g.
kernel logging via dev_*(), pointer annotations and such) intact.

Permission to reuse and mainline the driver code was formally granted by
Ralph Metzler <rjkm@metzlerbros.de>.
