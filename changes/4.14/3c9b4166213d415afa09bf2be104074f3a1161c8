MIPS: CPS: Cluster support for topology functions

Modify the functions we use to read information about the topology of
the system (the number of cores, VPs & IOCUs that it contains) in order
to take into account multiple clusters, and provide a new function to
determine the number of clusters in the system.

Users of these functions are modified only such that they continue to
build successfully - having them actually handle multiple clusters is
left to further patches.
