KVM: VMX: cache secondary exec controls

Currently, secondary execution controls are divided in three groups:

- static, depending mostly on the module arguments or the processor
  (vmx_secondary_exec_control)

- static, depending on CPUID (vmx_cpuid_update)

- dynamic, depending on nested VMX or local APIC state

Because walking CPUID is expensive, prepare_vmcs02 is using only
the first group.  This however is unnecessarily complicated.  Just
cache the static secondary execution controls, and then prepare_vmcs02
does not need to compute them every time.  Computation of all static
secondary execution controls is now kept in a single function,
vmx_compute_secondary_exec_control.
