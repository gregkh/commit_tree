jump_label: Fix concurrent static_key_enable/disable()

static_key_enable/disable are trying to cap the static key count to
0/1.  However, their use of key->enabled is outside jump_label_lock
so they do not really ensure that.

Rewrite them to do a quick check for an already enabled (respectively,
already disabled), and then recheck under the jump label lock.  Unlike
static_key_slow_inc/dec, a failed check under the jump label lock does
not modify key->enabled.
