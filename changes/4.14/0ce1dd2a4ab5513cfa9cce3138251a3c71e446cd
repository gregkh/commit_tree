btrfs: Remove redundant setting of uuid in btrfs_block_header

btrfs_alloc_dev_extent currently unconditionally sets the uuid in the
leaf block header the function is working with. This is unnecessary
since this operation is peformed by the core btree handling code
(splitting a node, allocating a new btree block etc). So let's remove
it.
