irqchip: mips-gic: Inline __gic_init()

The __gic_init() function is only called from gic_of_init() now that the
non-DT path has been removed. In order to simplify the code & aid
readability, fold __gic_init() into gic_of_init().

This provides us with the ability to return an error code, which
__gic_init() was previously unable to do. As such the irq_domain_add_*()
error paths are modified to print & return an error rather than panic().
