ACPI: Make acpi_dma_configure() DMA regions aware

Current ACPI DMA configuration set-up device DMA capabilities through
kernel defaults that do not take into account platform specific DMA
configurations reported by firmware.

By leveraging the ACPI acpi_dev_get_dma_resources() API, add code
in acpi_dma_configure() to retrieve the DMA regions to correctly
set-up PCI devices DMA parameters.

Rework the ACPI IORT kernel API to make sure they can accommodate
the DMA set-up required by firmware. By making PCI devices DMA set-up
ACPI IORT specific, the kernel is shielded from unwanted regressions
that could be triggered by parsing DMA resources on arches that were
previously ignoring them (ie x86/ia64), leaving kernel behaviour
unchanged on those arches.
