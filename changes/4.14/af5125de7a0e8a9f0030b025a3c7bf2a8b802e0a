drm/stm: drv: Rename platform driver name

Rename the platform driver name from "stm" to "stm32-display"
for a better readability in /sys/bus/platform/drivers entries.

Note: We keep "stm" as drm_driver.name because it is better
when using "modetest -M stm ..." (even if recent modetest patch
avoids using -M).
