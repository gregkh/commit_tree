hv_sock: add locking in the open/close/release code paths

Without the patch, when hvs_open_connection() hasn't completely established
a connection (e.g. it has changed sk->sk_state to SS_CONNECTED, but hasn't
inserted the sock into the connected queue), vsock_stream_connect() may see
the sk_state change and return the connection to the userspace, and next
when the userspace closes the connection quickly, hvs_release() may not see
the connection in the connected queue; finally hvs_open_connection()
inserts the connection into the queue, but we won't be able to purge the
connection for ever.
