scsi: esp_scsi: Clean up control flow and dead code

This patch improves readability. There are no functional changes.

Since this touches on a questionable ESP_INTR_DC conditional, add some
commentary to help others who may (as I did) find themselves chasing an
"Invalid Command" error after the device flags this condition.

This cleanup also eliminates a warning from "make W=1":
drivers/scsi/esp_scsi.c: In function 'esp_finish_select':
drivers/scsi/esp_scsi.c:1233:5: warning: variable 'orig_select_state' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  u8 orig_select_state;
