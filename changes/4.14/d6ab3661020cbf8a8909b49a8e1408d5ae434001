quota: Acquire dqio_sem for reading in vfs_load_quota_inode()

vfs_load_quota_inode() needs dqio_sem only for reading. In fact dqio_sem
is not needed there at all since the function can be called only during
quota on when quota file cannot be modified but let's leave the
protection there since it is logical and the path is in no way
performance critical.
