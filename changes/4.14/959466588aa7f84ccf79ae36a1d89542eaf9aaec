net_sched: call qlen_notify only if child qdisc is empty

This callback is used for deactivating class in parent qdisc.
This is cheaper to test queue length right here.

Also this allows to catch draining screwed backlog and prevent
second deactivation of already inactive parent class which will
crash kernel for sure. Kernel with print warning at destruction
of child qdisc where no packets but backlog is not zero.
