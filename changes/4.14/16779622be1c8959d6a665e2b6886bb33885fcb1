spi: spi-ep93xx: add spi master prepare_transfer_hardware()

This driver currently enables the hardware at the start of every
message and disabled it when the message is complete. Make it a
bit smarter by adding the prepare_transfer_hardware() and
unprepare_transfer_hardware() callbacks so that the core can
enable/disable the hardware based on spi message queue.
