atm: ambassador: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  13372	    408	      4	  13784	   35d8	drivers/atm/ambassador.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  13484	    296	      4	  13784	   35d8	drivers/atm/ambassador.o
