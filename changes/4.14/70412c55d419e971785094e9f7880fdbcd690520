powerpc/64: Fix watchdog configuration regressions

This fixes a couple more bits of fallout from the new hard lockup watchdog
patch.

It restores the required hw_nmi_get_sample_period() function for the
perf watchdog, and removes some function declarations on 64e that are only
defined for 64s. This fixes the 64e build when the hardlockup detector is
enabled.

It restores the default behaviour of disabling the perf watchdog, and also
fixes disabling the 64s watchdog when running as a guest.
