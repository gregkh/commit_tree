powerpc/perf/imc: Fix nest events on muti socket system

In a multi node system with discontiguous node ids, nest event values
are not showing up properly. eg. lscpu output:

  NUMA node0 CPU(s): 0-15
  NUMA node8 CPU(s): 16-31

Nest event values on such systems can be counted on CPUs <= 15:

  $./perf stat -e 'nest_powerbus0_imc/PM_PB_CYC/' -C 0-14 -I 1000 sleep 1000
  #           time             counts unit events
       1.000294577    30,17,24,42,880 nest_powerbus0_imc/PM_PB_CYC/

But not on CPUs >= 16:

  $./perf stat -e 'nest_powerbus0_imc/PM_PB_CYC/' -C 16-28 -I 1000 sleep 1000
  #           time             counts unit events
       1.000049902    <not supported> nest_powerbus0_imc/PM_PB_CYC/

This is because, when fetching the reference count, the node id (which
may be sparse) is used as the array index, not the node number (which
is 0 based and contiguous).

Fix it by using the node number as the array index.

  $./perf stat -e 'nest_powerbus0_imc/PM_PB_CYC/' -C 16-28 -I 1000 sleep 1000
  #           time             counts unit events
       1.000241961    26,12,35,28,704 nest_powerbus0_imc/PM_PB_CYC/
