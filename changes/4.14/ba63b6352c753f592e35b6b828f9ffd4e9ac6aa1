drm: omapdrm: hdmi: Configure the PLL from the HDMI core version

The OMAP4 and OMAP5 PLLs have different properties that require specific
handling in the HDMI PLL driver. This needs knowledge of the PLL
version, which is currently inferred from the DSS version. AS part of
the effort to remove usage of the DSS version, use the HDMI controller
version instead.
