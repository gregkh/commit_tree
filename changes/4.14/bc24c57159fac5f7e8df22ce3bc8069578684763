iommu/vt-d: Don't free parent pagetable of the PTE we're adding

When adding a large scatterlist entry that covers more than the L3
superpage size (1GB) but has an alignment such that we must use L2
superpages (2MB) , we give dma_pte_free_level() a range that causes it
to free the L3 pagetable we're about to populate. We fix this by telling
dma_pte_free_pagetable() about the pagetable level we're about to populate
to prevent freeing it.

For example, mapping a scatterlist with entry lengths 854MB and 1194MB
at IOVA 0xffff80000000 would, when processing the 2MB-aligned second
entry, cause pfn_to_dma_pte() to create a L3 directory to hold L2
superpages for the mapping at IOVA 0xffffc0000000. We would previously
call dma_pte_free_pagetable(domain, 0xffffc0000, 0xfffffffff), which
would free the L3 directory pfn_to_dma_pte() just created for IO PFN
0xffffc0000. Telling dma_pte_free_pagetable() to retain the L3
directories while using L2 superpages avoids the erroneous free.
