brcmfmac: Add check for short event packets

The length of the data in the received skb is currently passed into
brcmf_fweh_process_event() as packet_len, but this value is not checked.
event_packet should be followed by DATALEN bytes of additional event
data.  Ensure that the received packet actually contains at least
DATALEN bytes of additional data, to avoid copying uninitialized memory
into event->data.
