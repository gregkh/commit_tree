drm/syncobj: add sync obj wait interface. (v8)

This interface will allow sync object to be used to back
Vulkan fences. This API is pretty much the vulkan fence waiting
API, and I've ported the code from amdgpu.

v2: accept relative timeout, pass remaining time back
to userspace.
v3: return to absolute timeouts.
v4: absolute zero = poll,
    rewrite any/all code to have same operation for arrays
    return -EINVAL for 0 fences.
v4.1: fixup fences allocation check, use u64_to_user_ptr
v5: move to sec/nsec, and use timespec64 for calcs.
v6: use -ETIME and drop the out status flag. (-ETIME
is suggested by ickle, I can feel a shed painting)
v7: talked to Daniel/Arnd, use ktime and ns everywhere.
v8: be more careful in the timeout calculations
    use uint32_t for counter variables so we don't overflow
    graciously handle -ENOINT being returned from dma_fence_wait_timeout
