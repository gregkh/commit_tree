proto_ops: Add locked held versions of sendmsg and sendpage

Add new proto_ops sendmsg_locked and sendpage_locked that can be
called when the socket lock is already held. Correspondingly, add
kernel_sendmsg_locked and kernel_sendpage_locked as front end
functions.

These functions will be used in zero proxy so that we can take
the socket lock in a ULP sendmsg/sendpage and then directly call the
backend transport proto_ops functions.
