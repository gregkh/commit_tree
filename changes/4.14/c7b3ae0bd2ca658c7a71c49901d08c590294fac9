tracing: Ignore mmiotrace from kernel commandline

The mmiotrace tracer cannot be enabled with ftrace=mmiotrace in kernel
commandline. With this patch, noboot is added to the tracer struct,
and when system boot with a tracer that has noboot=true, it will print
out a warning message and continue booting.
