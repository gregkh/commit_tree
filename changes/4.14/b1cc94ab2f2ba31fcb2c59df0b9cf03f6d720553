shmem: shmem_charge: verify max_block is not exceeded before inode update

Patch series "userfaultfd: enable zeropage support for shmem".

These patches enable support for UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE for shared memory.

The first two patches are not strictly related to userfaultfd, they are
just minor refactoring to reduce amount of code duplication.

This patch (of 7):

Currently we update inode and shmem_inode_info before verifying that
used_blocks will not exceed max_blocks.  In case it will, we undo the
update.  Let's switch the order and move the verification of the blocks
count before the inode and shmem_inode_info update.
