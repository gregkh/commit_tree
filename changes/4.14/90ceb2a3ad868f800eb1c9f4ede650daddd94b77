kernel/params.c: fix the maximum length in param_get_string

The length parameter of strlcpy() is supposed to reflect the size of the
target buffer, not of the source string.  Harmless in this case as the
buffer is PAGE_SIZE long and the source string is always much shorter than
this, but conceptually wrong, so let's fix it.
