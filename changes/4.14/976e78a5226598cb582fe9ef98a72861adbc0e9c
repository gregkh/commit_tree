ARC: [plat-axs10x] sdio: Temporary fix of sdio ciu frequency

DW sdio controller has external ciu clock divider controlled
via register in SDIO IP. It divides sdio_ref_clk
(which comes from CGU) by 16 for default. So default mmcclk
clock (which comes to sdk_in) is 25000000 Hz.

So fix wrong current value (50000000 Hz) to actual 25000000 Hz.

Note this is a preventive fix, in line with similar change for HSDK
where this was actually needed. see:
