Btrfs: remove BUG_ON in __add_tree_block

The BUG_ON() can be triggered when the caller is processing an invalid
extent inline ref, e.g.

a shared data ref is offered instead of an extent data ref, such that
it tries to find a non-existent tree block and then btrfs_search_slot
returns 1 for no such item.

This replaces the BUG_ON() with a WARN() followed by calling
btrfs_print_leaf() to show more details about what's going on and
returning -EINVAL to upper callers.
