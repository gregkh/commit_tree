drm/atomic-helper: Simplify commit tracking locking

The crtc->commit_lock only protects commit_list and commit_entry. If
we chase the pointer from the drm_atomic_state update structure, then
we don't need any locks (since we hold a reference already).

Simplify the locking accordingly.

Noticed while reviewing a patch from Boris.
