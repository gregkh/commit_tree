Btrfs: fix kernel oops while reading compressed data

The kernel oops happens at

kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:2104!
...
RIP: clean_io_failure+0x263/0x2a0 [btrfs]

It's showing that read-repair code is using an improper mirror index.
This is due to the fact that compression read's endio hasn't recorded
the failed mirror index in %cb->orig_bio.

With this, btrfs's read-repair can work properly on reading compressed
data.
