perf annotate browser: Circulate percent, total-period and nr-samples view

Using the existing 't' hotkey, support the three views: percent, total
period and number of samples on the annotate TUI browser, circulating
them like below:

  Percent -> Total Period -> Nr Samples -> Percent ...

Committer notes:

Removed new 'e' hotkey, should be resubmitted as a separate patch, with
proper justification for its inclusion.
