drm: rcar-du: Repair vblank for DRM page flips using the VSP

The driver recently switched from handling page flip completion in the
DU vertical blanking handler to the VSP frame end handler to fix a race
condition. This unfortunately resulted in incorrect timestamps in the
vertical blanking events sent to userspace as vertical blanking is now
handled after sending the event.

To fix this we must reverse the order of the two operations. The easiest
way is to handle vertical blanking in the VSP frame end handler before
sending the event. The VSP frame end interrupt occurs approximately 50Âµs
earlier than the DU frame end interrupt, but this should not cause any
undue harm.

As we need to handle vertical blanking even when page flip completion is
delayed, the VSP driver now needs to call the frame end completion
callback unconditionally, with a new argument to report whether page
flip has completed.

With this new scheme the DU vertical blanking interrupt isn't needed
anymore, so we can stop enabling it.
