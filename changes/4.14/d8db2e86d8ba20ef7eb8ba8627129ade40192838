rcu: Add TPS() protection for _rcu_barrier_trace strings

The _rcu_barrier_trace() function is a wrapper for trace_rcu_barrier(),
which needs TPS() protection for strings passed through the second
argument.  However, it has escaped prior TPS()-ification efforts because
it _rcu_barrier_trace() does not start with "trace_".  This commit
therefore adds the needed TPS() protection
