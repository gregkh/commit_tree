dma-buf/sw_sync: clean up list before signaling the fence

If userspace already dropped its own reference by closing the sw_sync
fence fd we might end up in a deadlock where
dma_fence_is_signaled_locked() will trigger the release of the fence and
thus try to hold the lock to remove the fence from the list.

dma_fence_is_signaled_locked() tries to release/free the fence and hold
the lock in the process.

We fix that by changing the order operation and clean up the list and
rb-tree first.
