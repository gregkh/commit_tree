net: Add module reference to FIB notifiers

When a listener registers to the FIB notification chain it receives a
dump of the FIB entries and rules from existing address families by
invoking their dump operations.

While we call into these modules we need to make sure they aren't
removed. Do that by increasing their reference count before invoking
their dump operations and decrease it afterwards.
