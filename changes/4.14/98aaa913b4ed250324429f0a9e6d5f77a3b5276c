tcp: Extend SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE to TCP recvmsg

When SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE is enabled for tcp sockets, return the
timestamp corresponding to the highest sequence number data returned.

Previously the skb->tstamp is overwritten when a TCP packet is placed
in the out of order queue.  While the packet is in the ooo queue, save the
timestamp in the TCB_SKB_CB.  This space is shared with the gso_*
options which are only used on the tx path, and a previously unused 4
byte hole.

When skbs are coalesced either in the sk_receive_queue or the
out_of_order_queue always choose the timestamp of the appended skb to
maintain the invariant of returning the timestamp of the last byte in
the recvmsg buffer.
