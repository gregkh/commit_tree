drm/i915: Look for active requests earlier in the reset path

And store the active request so that we only search for it once.

v2: Check for request completion inside _prepare_engine, don't use
ECANCELED, remove unnecessary null checks (Chris).

v3: Capture active requests during reset_prepare and store it the
engine hangcheck obj.

v4: Rename commit, change i915_gem_reset_request to just confirm the
active_request is still incomplete, instead of engine_stalled (Chris).

v5: With style; pass the active request to gem_reset_engine, keep single
return in reset_prepare_engine (Chris).

v6: Moved before reset-engine code appears (Chris)
