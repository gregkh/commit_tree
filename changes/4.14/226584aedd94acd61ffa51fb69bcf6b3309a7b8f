spi: fix IDR collision on systems with both fixed and dynamic SPI bus numbers

On systems where some controllers get a dynamic ID assigned and some have
a fixed number from DT, the current implemention might run into an IDR
collision if the dynamic controllers gets probed first and get an IDR number,
which is later requested by the controller with the fixed numbering. When
this happens the fixed controller will fail to register with the SPI core.

Fix this by skipping all known alias numbers when assigning the dynamic IDs.
