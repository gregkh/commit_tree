mm: oom: let oom_reap_task and exit_mmap run concurrently

This is purely required because exit_aio() may block and exit_mmap() may
never start, if the oom_reap_task cannot start running on a mm with
mm_users == 0.

At the same time if the OOM reaper doesn't wait at all for the memory of
the current OOM candidate to be freed by exit_mmap->unmap_vmas, it would
generate a spurious OOM kill.

If it wasn't because of the exit_aio or similar blocking functions in
the last mmput, it would be enough to change the oom_reap_task() in the
case it finds mm_users == 0, to wait for a timeout or to wait for
__mmput to set MMF_OOM_SKIP itself, but it's not just exit_mmap the
problem here so the concurrency of exit_mmap and oom_reap_task is
apparently warranted.

It's a non standard runtime, exit_mmap() runs without mmap_sem, and
oom_reap_task runs with the mmap_sem for reading as usual (kind of
MADV_DONTNEED).

The race between the two is solved with a combination of
tsk_is_oom_victim() (serialized by task_lock) and MMF_OOM_SKIP
(serialized by a dummy down_write/up_write cycle on the same lines of
the ksm_exit method).

If the oom_reap_task() may be running concurrently during exit_mmap,
exit_mmap will wait it to finish in down_write (before taking down mm
structures that would make the oom_reap_task fail with use after free).

If exit_mmap comes first, oom_reap_task() will skip the mm if
MMF_OOM_SKIP is already set and in turn all memory is already freed and
furthermore the mm data structures may already have been taken down by
free_pgtables.
