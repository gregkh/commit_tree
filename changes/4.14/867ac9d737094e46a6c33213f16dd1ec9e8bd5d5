objtool: Fix gcov check for older versions of GCC

Objtool tries to silence 'unreachable instruction' warnings when it
detects gcov is enabled, because gcov produces a lot of unreachable
instructions and they don't really matter.

However, the 0-day bot is still reporting some unreachable instruction
warnings with CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=y on GCC 4.6.4.

As it turns out, objtool's gcov detection doesn't work with older
versions of GCC because they don't create a bunch of symbols with the
'gcov.' prefix like newer versions of GCC do.

Move the gcov check out of objtool and instead just create a new
'--no-unreachable' flag which can be passed in by the kernel Makefile
when CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL is defined.

Also rename the 'nofp' variable to 'no_fp' for consistency with the new
'no_unreachable' variable.
