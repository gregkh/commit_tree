net: dsa: User per-cpu 64-bit statistics

During testing with a background iperf pushing 1Gbit/sec worth of
traffic and having both ifconfig and ethtool collect statistics, we
could see quite frequent deadlocks. Convert the often accessed DSA slave
network devices statistics to per-cpu 64-bit statistics to remove these
deadlocks and provide fast efficient statistics updates.
