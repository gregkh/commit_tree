qtnfmac: updates for regulatory support

On startup driver obtains regulatory rules from firmware and
enables them during wiphy registration. Later on regulatory
domain change can be requested by host. In this case firmware
is notified about the upcoming changes. If the change is valid,
then firmware updates hardware channel configuration and host
driver receives updated channel info for each band.
