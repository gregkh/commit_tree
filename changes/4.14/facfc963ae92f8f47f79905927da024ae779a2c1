scsi: g_NCR5380: Two DTC436 PDMA workarounds

Limit PDMA send to 512 B to avoid data corruption on DTC3181E. The
corruption is always the same: one byte missing at the beginning of a
128 B block. It happens only with slow Quantum LPS 240 drive, not with
faster IBM DORS-32160. It's not clear what causes this. Documentation
for the DTC436 chip has not been made available.
