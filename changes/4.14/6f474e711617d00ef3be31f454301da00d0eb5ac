xen/pvcalls: implement accept command

Implement the accept command by calling inet_accept. To avoid blocking
in the kernel, call inet_accept(O_NONBLOCK) from a workqueue, which get
scheduled on sk_data_ready (for a passive socket, it means that there
are connections to accept).

Use the reqcopy field to store the request. Accept the new socket from
the delayed work function, create a new sock_mapping for it, map
the indexes page and data ring, and reply to the other end. Allocate an
ioworker for the socket.

Only support one outstanding blocking accept request for every socket at
any time.

Add a field to sock_mapping to remember the passive socket from which an
active socket was created.
