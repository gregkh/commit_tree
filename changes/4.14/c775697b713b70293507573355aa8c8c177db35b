microblaze/PCI: Remove pcibios_setup_bus_{self/devices} dead code

01cf9d524ff0 ("microblaze/PCI: Support generic Xilinx AXI PCIe Host Bridge
IP driver") removed pcibios calls to:

  pcibios_setup_bus_self()
  pcibios_setup_bus_devices()

Given that pcibios_fixup_bus() was the only caller of those functions they
have now become dead code (along with the functions they were calling in
turn), so they can be removed.
