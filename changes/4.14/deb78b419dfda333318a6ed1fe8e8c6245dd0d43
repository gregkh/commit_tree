nullb: emulate cache

Software must flush disk cache to guarantee data safety. To check if
software correctly does disk cache flush, we must know the behavior of
disk. But physical disk behavior is uncontrollable. Even software
doesn't do the flush, the disk probably does the flush. This patch tries
to emulate a cache in the test disk.

All write will go to a cache first, when the cache is full, we then
flush some data to disk storage. A flush request will flush all data of
the cache to disk storage. A FUA write will write to memory store
directly and revalidate data in cache. If there is a power failure (by
writing to power attribute, 'echo 0 > disk_name/power'), we discard all
data in the cache, but preserve the data in disk storage. Later we can
power on the disk again as usual (write 1 to 'power' attribute), then we
can check data integrity and very if software does everything correctly.

A new attribute 'cache_size' (in MB) is added to configure cache size.
