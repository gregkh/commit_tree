sched/numa: Slow down scan rate if shared faults dominate

The comment above update_task_scan_period() says the scan period should
be increased (scanning slows down) if the majority of memory accesses
are on the local node, or if the majority of the page accesses are
shared with other tasks.

However, with the current code, all a high ratio of shared accesses
does is slow down the rate at which scanning is made faster.

This patch changes things so either lots of shared accesses or
lots of local accesses will slow down scanning, and numa scanning
is sped up only when there are lots of private faults on remote
memory pages.
