i40e: Update state variable for adminq subtask

During NVM update, state machine gets into unrecoverable state because
i40e_clean_adminq_subtask can get scheduled after the admin queue
command but before other state variables are updated. This causes
incorrect input to i40e_nvmupd_check_wait_event and state transitions
don't happen.

This fix updates the state variables so that adminq_subtask will have
accurate information whenever it gets scheduled.
