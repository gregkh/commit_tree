ACPI: Prepare for constifying acpi_get_next_subnode() fwnode argument

Make local variables const (head) or add new variables; adev was used for
two purposes: to refer the root device node and its children. The two
purposes are separated by this patch.

This is preparation for making fwnode arguments const for fwnode ops.
Don't constify the argument itself quite yet as this is used as a callback
function.
