net/ncsi: Configure VLAN tag filter

Make use of the ndo_vlan_rx_{add,kill}_vid callbacks to have the NCSI
stack process new VLAN tags and configure the channel VLAN filter
appropriately.
Several VLAN tags can be set and a "Set VLAN Filter" packet must be sent
for each one, meaning the ncsi_dev_state_config_svf state must be
repeated. An internal list of VLAN tags is maintained, and compared
against the current channel's ncsi_channel_filter in order to keep track
within the state. VLAN filters are removed in a similar manner, with the
introduction of the ncsi_dev_state_config_clear_vids state. The maximum
number of VLAN tag filters is determined by the "Get Capabilities"
response from the channel.
