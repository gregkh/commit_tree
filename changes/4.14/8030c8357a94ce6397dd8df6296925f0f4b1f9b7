RDMA/core: Add iterator over ib_devices

The coming nldev needs to iterate over all IB devices in the system
and in order to not expose the ib_devices list outside the devices.c,
it is necessary to provide function iterator.

Current version is written explicitly for nldev callback to avoid
over-engineering at this stage, but it can be easily extended for
other types.
