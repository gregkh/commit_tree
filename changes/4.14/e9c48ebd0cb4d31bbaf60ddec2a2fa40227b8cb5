IB/hfi1: Remove atomic SDMA_REQ_HAS_ERROR bit operation

Atomic bit tests are used to single errors and the
completion of request submissions. These operations
don't need to be atomic and show to be expensive on
the profile.

Replace each atomic bit operation with a bool type
and a READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE pairing.
