USB: gadgetfs: fix copy_to_user while holding spinlock

The gadgetfs driver as a long-outstanding FIXME, regarding a call of
copy_to_user() made while holding a spinlock.  This patch fixes the
issue by dropping the spinlock and using the dev->udc_usage mechanism
introduced by another recent patch to guard against status changes
while the lock isn't held.
