MIPS: CM: Add cluster & block args to mips_cm_lock_other()

With CM >= 3.5 we have the notion of multiple clusters & can access
their CM, CPC & GIC registers via the apporpriate redirect/other
register blocks. In order to allow for this introduce cluster & block
arguments to mips_cm_lock_other() which configures the redirect/other
region to point at the appropriate cluster, core, VP & register block.

Since we now have 4 arguments to mips_cm_lock_other() & a common use is
likely to be to target the cluster, core & VP corresponding to a
particular Linux CPU number we also add a new mips_cm_lock_other_cpu()
helper function which handles that without the caller needing to
manually pull out the cluster, core & VP numbers.
