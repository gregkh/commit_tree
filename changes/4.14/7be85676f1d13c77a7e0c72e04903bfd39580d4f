IB/hfi1: Don't remove RB entry when not needed.

An RB tree is used for the SDMA pinning cache. Cache
entries are extracted and reinserted from the tree
in case the address range for it changes. However,
if the address range for the entry doesn't change,
deleting the entry from the RB tree is not necessary.

This affects performance since the tree needs to be
rebalanced for each insertion, and this happens in
the hot path. Optimize RB search by not removing
entries when it's not needed.
