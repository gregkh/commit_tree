x86/fpu: Rename fpu::fpstate_active to fpu::initialized

The x86 FPU code used to have a complex state machine where both the FPU
registers and the FPU state context could be 'active' (or inactive)
independently of each other - which enabled features like lazy FPU restore.

Much of this complexity is gone in the current code: now we basically can
have FPU-less tasks (kernel threads) that don't use (and save/restore) FPU
state at all, plus full FPU users that save/restore directly with no laziness
whatsoever.

But the fpu::fpstate_active still carries bits of the old complexity - meanwhile
this flag has become a simple flag that shows whether the FPU context saving
area in the thread struct is initialized and used, or not.

Rename it to fpu::initialized to express this simplicity in the name as well.
