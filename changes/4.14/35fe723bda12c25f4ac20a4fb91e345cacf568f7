rcu/tracing: Set disable_rcu_irq_enter on rcu_eqs_exit()

Set disable_rcu_irq_enter on not only rcu_eqs_enter_common() but also
rcu_eqs_exit(), since rcu_eqs_exit() suffers from the same issue as was
fixed for rcu_eqs_enter_common() by commit 03ecd3f48e57 ("rcu/tracing:
Add rcu_disabled to denote when rcu_irq_enter() will not work").
