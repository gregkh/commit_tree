drm/i915: wire up shrinkctl->nr_scanned

shrink_slab() allows us to report back the number of objects we
successfully scanned (out of the target shrinkctl->nr_to_scan).  As
report the number of pages owned by each GEM object as a separate item
to the shrinker, we cannot precisely control the number of shrinker
objects we scan on each pass; and indeed may free more than requested.
If we fail to tell the shrinker about the number of objects we process,
it will continue to hold a grudge against us as any objects left
unscanned are added to the next reclaim -- and so we will keep on
"unfairly" shrinking our own slab in comparison to other slabs.
