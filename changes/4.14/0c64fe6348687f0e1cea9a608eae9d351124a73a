MIPS: math-emu: <MADDF|MSUBF>.<D|S>: Fix some cases of infinite inputs

Fix the cases of <MADDF|MSUBF>.<D|S> when any of two multiplicands is
infinity. The correct behavior in such cases is affected by the nature
of third input. Cases of addition of infinities with opposite signs
and subtraction of infinities with same signs may arise and must be
handles separately. Also, the value od flags argument (that determines
whether the instruction is MADDF or MSUBF) affects the outcome.

Relevant examples:

MADDF.S fd,fs,ft:
  If fs contains +inf, ft contains +inf, and fd contains -inf, fd is
  going to contain indef (without this patch, it used to contain
  -inf).

MSUBF.S fd,fs,ft:
  If fs contains +inf, ft contains 1.0, and fd contains +0.0, fd is
  going to contain -inf (without this patch, it used to contain +inf).

Fixes: 83d43305a1df ("MIPS: math-emu: Add support for the MIPS R6 MSUBF FPU instruction")
