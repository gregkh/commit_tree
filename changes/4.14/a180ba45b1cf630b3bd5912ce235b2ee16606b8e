ASoC: codecs: add const to snd_soc_codec_driver structures

Declare snd_soc_codec_driver structures as const as they are only passed
as an argument to the function snd_soc_register_codec. This argument is
of type const, so declare the structures with this property as const.
In file codecs/sn95031.c, snd_soc_codec_driver structure is also used in
a copy operation along with getting passed to snd_soc_register_codec.
So, it can be made const too.
Done using Coccinelle:

@match disable optional_qualifier@
identifier s;
position p;
@@
static struct snd_soc_codec_driver s@p={...};

@good1@
identifier match.s;
position p;
@@
snd_soc_register_codec(...,&s@p,...)

@bad@
identifier match.s;
position p!={match.p,good1.p};

@depends on !bad disable optional_qualifier@
identifier match.s;
@@
static
+const
struct snd_soc_codec_driver s={...};
