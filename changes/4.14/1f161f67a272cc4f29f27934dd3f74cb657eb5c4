x86/microcode: Do the family check first

On CPUs like AMD's Geode, for example, we shouldn't even try to load
microcode because they do not support the modern microcode loading
interface.

However, we do the family check *after* the other checks whether the
loader has been disabled on the command line or whether we're running in
a guest.

So move the family checks first in order to exit early if we're being
loaded on an unsupported family.
