NFS: nfs_lock_and_join_requests and nfs_scan_commit_list can deadlock

Since the commit list is not ordered, it is possible for nfs_scan_commit_list
to hold a request that nfs_lock_and_join_requests() is waiting for, while
at the same time trying to grab a request that nfs_lock_and_join_requests
already holds.
