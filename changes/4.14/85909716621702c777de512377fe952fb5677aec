drm: armada: make of_device_ids const.

of_device_ids are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with of_device_ids provided by <linux/of.h> work with const
of_device_ids. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   8836	    744	      0	   9580	   256c	drivers/gpu/drm/armada/armada_crtc.o

File size after constify armada_lcd_of_match:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   9220	    328	      0	   9548	   254c	drivers/gpu/drm/armada/armada_crtc.o
