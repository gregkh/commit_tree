RDMA/netlink: Add and implement doit netlink callback

The .doit callback is used by netlink core to differentiate
between get and set operations. Common convention is to use
that call for command operations like (SET, ADD, e.t.c.) and/or
access without NLF_M_DUMP flag.

This commit adds proper declaration and implementation
to RDMA netlink.
