ACPICA: linuxize: cleanup typedef definitions

ACPICA commit 894e49ef22db354eb1685cdb6f5f991766351d3c

acpisrc now has capability to convert both the followings:
1. Form 1:
  typedef struct/union foo {         struct/union foo {
     ....                       -->      ...
  } FOO;                             }
2. Form 2:
  typedef struct/union foo FOO; -->  typedef struct/union foo foo;
It becomes unable to handle the following:
3. Form3:
  typedef struct/union foo { /* comment */
      ...
  } FOO;
    -->
  strut/union foo { /* comment */
      ...
  };

As:
1. The purpose of acpisrc is to convert formatted code (ACPICA coding
   style) into linux coding style,
2. acpisrc is a very simple tool that doesn't fully handle C language.
This commit changes the definitions side in order not to regress and we
shall make "no comments in struct/union line" as a new ACPICA coding style
rule. Lv Zheng.
