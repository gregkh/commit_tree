gianfar: Fix Tx flow control deactivation

The wrong register is checked for the Tx flow control bit,
it should have been maccfg1 not maccfg2.
This went unnoticed for so long probably because the impact is
hardly visible, not to mention the tangled code from adjust_link().
First, link flow control (i.e. handling of Rx/Tx link level pause frames)
is disabled by default (needs to be enabled via 'ethtool -A').
Secondly, maccfg2 always returns 0 for tx_flow_oldval (except for a few
old boards), which results in Tx flow control remaining always on
once activated.
