powerpc/perf: Factor out PPMU_ONLY_COUNT_RUN check code from power8

There are some hardware events on Power systems which only count when
the processor is not idle, and there are some fixed-function counters
which count such events. For example, the "run cycles" event counts
cycles when the processor is not idle. If the user asks to count
cycles, we can use "run cycles" if this is a per-task event, since the
processor is running when the task is running, by definition. We can't
use "run cycles" if the user asks for "cycles" on a system-wide
counter.

Currently in power8 this check is done using PPMU_ONLY_COUNT_RUN flag
in power8_get_alternatives() function. Based on the flag, events are
switched if needed. This function should also be enabled in power9, so
factor out the code to isa207_get_alternatives().
