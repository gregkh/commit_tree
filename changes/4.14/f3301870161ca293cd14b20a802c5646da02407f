(IB, net)/mlx4: Add resource utilization support

Adding visibility of resource usage of QPs, CQs and counters used by
virtual functions. This feature will be used to give the PF administrator
more data while debugging VF status. Usage info was added to ALLOC_RES
command, to notify the PF if the resource which is being reserved or
allocated for the VF will be used by kernel driver or by user verbs.

Updated reservation and allocation functions of QP, CQ and counter with
additional usage parameter.
