selftests: lib.mk: change RUN_TESTS to print messages in TAP13 format

Change common RUN_TESTS to print messages in user friendly TAP13 format.
This change add TAP13 header at the start of RUN_TESTS target run, and
prints the resulting pass/fail messages with test number information in
the TAP 13 format for each test in the run tests list.

This change covers test scripts as well as test programs. Test programs
have an option to use ksft_ API, however test scripts won't be able to.
With this change, test scripts can print TAP13 format output without any
changes to individual scripts.

Test programs can provide TAP13 format output as needed as some tests
already do. Tests that haven't been converted will benefit from this
change. Tests that are converted benefit from the test counts for all
the tests in each test directory.

Running firmware tests:
make --silent -C tools/testing/selftests/firmware/ run_tests

Before the change:

modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'test_firmware': Operation not

CONFIG_TEST_FIRMWARE=y

modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'test_firmware': Operation not
permitted
