ARC: [plat-eznps] Handle user memory error same in simulation and silicon

On ARC700 (and nSIM), user mode memory error triggers an L2 interrupt
which is handled gracefully by kernel (or it tries to despite this being
imprecise, and error could get charged to kernel itself). The offending
task is killed and kernel moves on.

NPS hardware however raises a Machine Check exception for same error
which is NOT recoverable by kernel.

This patch aligns kernel handling for nSIM case, to same as hardware by
overriding the default user space bus error handler.
