media: vidioc-querycap: use a more realistic value for KERNEL_VERSION

In the past, V4L2 versions were 0.x.y, but that changed years
ago. Since Kernel 3.1, however, the numbering schema was changed
to match the Kernel version.

However, the presented example still uses the old numerating
schema, with is a misleading information.

So, update it to the new schema.
