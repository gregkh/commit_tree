coresight tmc etr: Add capabilitiy information

With new version of TMC ETR, there are differing set of
features supported by the TMC. Add the capability of a
given TMC ETR for making safer decisions at runtime.

The device configuration register of the TMC (DEVID) lists
some of the capabilities. So, we can detect some of them at
probe. However, some of the features (or changes in behavior)
are not advertised and we have to depend on the PID to infer
the features. So we use a static description of the "unadvertised"
capabilities attached to the PID. Combining both, the static
and the dynamic capabilities, we maintain a bitmask of the
available features which can be later checked to take
appropriate actions.
