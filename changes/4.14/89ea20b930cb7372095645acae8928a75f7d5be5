drm/i915/gvt: Factor out scan and shadow from workload dispatch

To perform the workload scan and shadow in ELSP writing stage for
performance consideration, the workload scan and shadow stuffs
should be factored out from dispatch_workload().

v2:Put context pin before i915_add_request;
   Refine the comments;
   Rename some APIs;

v3:workload->status should set only when error happens.
v4:i915_add_request is must to have after i915_gem_request_alloc.
