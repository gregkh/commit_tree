dt-bindings: pinctrl: add most other IPQ4019 pin functions and groups

This patch adds the remaining pin functions and mux groups.
All unknown and debug functions are omitted. Existing functions
for qpic, sdio, rgmii, rmii, wifi/d are squashed together as
much as possible. And only in case of a clash, the individually
named functions have been kept. The exceptions are:
	led0-11
	i2s_rx, i2s_tx, i2s_td, i2s_spdif_in, i2s_spdif_out,
	smart0-3
