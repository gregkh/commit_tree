spmi: pmic-arb: remove the read/write access checks

The access mode checks for peripheral ownership for read/write
permissions should not be required. Every peripheral enabled for
this master is expected to have a read/write permissions. If there
is any such invalid access due to wrong configuration in boot loader
or device tree files, then it should be fixed in those locations.
Hence, remove the access mode checks from the driver.
