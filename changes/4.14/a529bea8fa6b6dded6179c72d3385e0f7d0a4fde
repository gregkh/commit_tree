timekeeping: Use proper timekeeper for debug code

When CONFIG_DEBUG_TIMEKEEPING is enabled the timekeeping_check_update()
function will update status like last_warning and underflow_seen on the
timekeeper.

If there are issues found this state is used to rate limit the warnings
that get printed.

This rate limiting doesn't really really work if stored in real_tk as
the shadow timekeeper is overwritten onto real_tk at the end of every
update_wall_time() call, resetting last_warning and other statuses.

Fix rate limiting by using the shadow_timekeeper for
timekeeping_check_update().
