net: hns3: Add support of HNS3 Ethernet Driver for hip08 SoC

This patch adds the support of Hisilicon Network Subsystem 3
Ethernet driver to hip08 family of SoCs.

This driver includes basic Rx/Tx functionality. It also includes
the client registration code with the HNAE3(Hisilicon Network
Acceleration Engine 3) framework.

This work provides the initial support to the hip08 SoC and
would incrementally add features or enhancements.
