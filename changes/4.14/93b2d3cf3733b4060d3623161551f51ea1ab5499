powerpc: Correct instruction code for xxlor instruction

The instruction code for xxlor that commit 0016a4cf5582 ("powerpc:
Emulate most Book I instructions in emulate_step()", 2010-06-15)
added is actually the code for xxlnor.  It is used in get_vsr()
and put_vsr() and the effect of the error is that if emulate_step
is used to emulate a VSX load or store from any register other
than vsr0, the bitwise complement of the correct value will be
loaded or stored.  This corrects the error.
