rtnetlink: bring NETDEV_POST_TYPE_CHANGE event process back in rtnetlink_event

As I said in patch 'rtnetlink: bring NETDEV_CHANGEMTU event process back
in rtnetlink_event', removing NETDEV_POST_TYPE_CHANGE event was not the
right fix for the redundant notifications issue.

So bring this event process back to rtnetlink_event and the old redundant
notifications issue would be fixed in the later patch 'rtnetlink: check
DO_SETLINK_NOTIFY correctly in do_setlink'.
