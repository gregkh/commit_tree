x86/mm: Disable branch profiling in mem_encrypt.c

Some routines in mem_encrypt.c are called very early in the boot process,
e.g. sme_encrypt_kernel(). When CONFIG_TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING=y is defined
the resulting branch profiling associated with the check to see if SME is
active results in a kernel crash. Disable branch profiling for
mem_encrypt.c by defining DISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING before including any
header files.
