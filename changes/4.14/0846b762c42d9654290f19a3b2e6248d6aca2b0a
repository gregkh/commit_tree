tty: synclink_gt: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  41180	    480	    185	  41845	   a375	drivers/tty/synclink_gt.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  41340	    320	    185	  41845	   a375	drivers/tty/synclink_gt.o
