powerpc/perf: Fix IMC allocation routine

When setting nr_cpus=1, we observed a crash in IMC code during boot
due to a missing allocation: basically, IMC code is taking the number
of threads into account in imc_mem_init() and if we manually set
nr_cpus for a value that is not multiple of the number of threads per
core, an integer division in that function will discard the decimal
portion, leading IMC to not allocate one mem_info struct. This causes
a NULL pointer dereference later, on is_core_imc_mem_inited().

This patch just rounds that division up, fixing the bug.
