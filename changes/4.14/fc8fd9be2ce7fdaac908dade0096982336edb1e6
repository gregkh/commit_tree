pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7795: Rename CS1# pin function definitions

This patch renames the pin function macro definitions of the GPSR1 and
IPSR4 registers value for the CS1# pin.

This is a correction because GPSR and IPSR register specification for
R8A7795 ES2.0 SoC was changed in R-Car Gen3 Hardware User's Manual
Rev.0.54E.
