platform/x86: peaq-wmi: silence a static checker warning

There is a harmless static checker warning here that unsigned values are
always >= 0.  The code looks like:

	if (peaq_ignore_events_counter && --peaq_ignore_events_counter >= 0)

The first part of the condition ensures that we never wrap around so the
code works as intended.  I've tweaked it slightly to avoid the warning.
