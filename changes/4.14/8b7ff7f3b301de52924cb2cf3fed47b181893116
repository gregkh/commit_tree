IB/mlx5: Enable UMR for MRs created with reg_create

This patch is the first step in decoupling UMR usage and
allocation from the MR cache. The only functional change
in this patch is to enables UMR for MRs created with
reg_create.

This change fixes a bug where ODP memory regions that
were not allocated from the MR cache did not have UMR
enabled.
