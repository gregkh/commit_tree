ARM: dts: imx: Correct B850v3 clock assignment

The IPU that drives HDMI must have its pre_sel set to pll2_pfd_396m
to avoid stepping on the LVDS output's toes, as the PLL can't be clocked
to the pixel clock and to the LVDS serial clock (3.5*pixel clock) at the
same time.

As we are using ipu1_di0 and ipu2_di0, ensure both are switched to
to pll2_pfd2_396m to avoid issues. The LDB driver will switch the
required IPU to ldb_di1 when it uses it to drive LVDS.
