crypto: arm/ghash - add NEON accelerated fallback for vmull.p64

Implement a NEON fallback for systems that do support NEON but have
no support for the optional 64x64->128 polynomial multiplication
instruction that is part of the ARMv8 Crypto Extensions. It is based
on the paper "Fast Software Polynomial Multiplication on ARM Processors
Using the NEON Engine" by Danilo Camara, Conrado Gouvea, Julio Lopez and
Ricardo Dahab (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01506572)

On a 32-bit guest executing under KVM on a Cortex-A57, the new code is
not only 4x faster than the generic table based GHASH driver, it is also
time invariant. (Note that the existing vmull.p64 code is 16x faster on
this core).
