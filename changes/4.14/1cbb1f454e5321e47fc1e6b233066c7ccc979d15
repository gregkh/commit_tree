btrfs: struct-funcs, constify readers

We have reader helpers for most of the on-disk structures that use
an extent_buffer and pointer as offset into the buffer that are
read-only.  We should mark them as const and, in turn, allow consumers
of these interfaces to mark the buffers const as well.

No impact on code, but serves as documentation that a buffer is intended
not to be modified.
