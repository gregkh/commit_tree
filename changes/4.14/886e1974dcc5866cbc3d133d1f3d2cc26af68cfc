s390/qeth: don't access skb after transmission

After transmitting a skb via send_packet[_fast](), the statistics
code accesses the skb once more to account for transmitted page frags.
This has a (theoretical?) race against the TX completion - if the TX
completion is processed and frees the skb before hard_start_xmit()
gets to the statistics part, we access random memory.

Fix this by caching the # of page frags, before the skb is transmitted.
