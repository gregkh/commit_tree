l2tp: fix race between l2tp_session_delete() and l2tp_tunnel_closeall()

There are several ways to remove L2TP sessions:

  * deleting a session explicitly using the netlink interface (with
    L2TP_CMD_SESSION_DELETE),
  * deleting the session's parent tunnel (either by closing the
    tunnel's file descriptor or using the netlink interface),
  * closing the PPPOL2TP file descriptor of a PPP pseudo-wire.

In some cases, when these methods are used concurrently on the same
session, the session can be removed twice, leading to use-after-free
bugs.

This patch adds a 'dead' flag, used by l2tp_session_delete() and
l2tp_tunnel_closeall() to prevent them from stepping on each other's
toes.

The session deletion path used when closing a PPPOL2TP file descriptor
doesn't need to be adapted. It already has to ensure that a session
remains valid for the lifetime of its PPPOL2TP file descriptor.
So it takes an extra reference on the session in the ->session_close()
callback (pppol2tp_session_close()), which is eventually dropped
in the ->sk_destruct() callback of the PPPOL2TP socket
(pppol2tp_session_destruct()).
Still, __l2tp_session_unhash() and l2tp_session_queue_purge() can be
called twice and even concurrently for a given session, but thanks to
proper locking and re-initialisation of list fields, this is not an
issue.
