ath10k: extend wmi service map to accommodate new services

Though there is room to accommodate 512 services in wmi service
ready event, target uses only first 4-bits of each 32-bit word for
advertising wmi services thereby limiting max wmi services to 64.

TDLS implementation for 10.4 firmwares introduces new wmi services by
making use of remaining unused bits of each 32-bit word, therefore the
wmi service mapping in host needs to be extended.

This patch adds the logic to extend the wmi SVCMAP to accommodate new
wmi services.
