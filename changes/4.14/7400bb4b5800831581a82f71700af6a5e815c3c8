netfilter: nf_reject_ipv4: Fix use-after-free in send_reset

niph is not updated after pskb_expand_head changes the skb head. It
still points to the freed data, which is then used to update tot_len and
checksum. This could cause use-after-free poison crash.

Update niph, if ip_route_me_harder does not fail.

This only affects the interaction with REJECT targets and br_netfilter.
