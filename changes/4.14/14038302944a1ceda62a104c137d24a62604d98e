fs, proc: unconditional cond_resched when reading smaps

If there are large numbers of hugepages to iterate while reading
/proc/pid/smaps, the page walk never does cond_resched().  On archs
without split pmd locks, there can be significant and observable
contention on mm->page_table_lock which cause lengthy delays without
rescheduling.

Always reschedule in smaps_pte_range() if necessary since the pagewalk
iteration can be expensive.
