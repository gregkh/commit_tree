drm/exynos: Fix locking in the suspend/resume paths

Commit 48a92916729b ("drm/exynos: use drm_for_each_connector_iter()")
replaced unsafe drm_for_each_connector() with drm_for_each_connector_iter()
and removed surrounding drm_modeset_lock calls. However, that lock was
there not only to protect unsafe drm_for_each_connector(), but it was also
required to be held by the dpms code which was called from the loop body.
This patch restores those drm_modeset_lock calls to fix broken suspend
and resume of Exynos DRM subsystem in v4.13 kernel.
