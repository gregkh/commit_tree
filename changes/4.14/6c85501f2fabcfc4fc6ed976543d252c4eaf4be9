fix infoleak in waitid(2)

kernel_waitid() can return a PID, an error or 0.  rusage is filled in the first
case and waitid(2) rusage should've been copied out exactly in that case, *not*
whenever kernel_waitid() has not returned an error.  Compat variant shares that
braino; none of kernel_wait4() callers do, so the below ought to fix it.
