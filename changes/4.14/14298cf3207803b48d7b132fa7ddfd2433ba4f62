scsi: megaraid_sas: Call megasas_complete_cmd_dpc_fusion every 1 second while there are pending commands

megasas_wait_for_outstanding_fusion checks for pending commands every 1
second. But megasas_complete_cmd_dpc_fusion is only called every 5
seconds.  If the commands are already completed by firmware, there is an
additional delay of 5 seconds before driver will process completion for
these commands.
