powerpc/powernv: Move GET_FIELD/SET_FIELD to vas.h

Move the GET_FIELD and SET_FIELD macros to vas.h as VAS and other
users of VAS, including NX-842 can use those macros.

There is a lot of related code between the VAS/NX kernel drivers
and skiboot. For consistency, switch the order of parameters in
SET_FIELD to match the order in skiboot.
