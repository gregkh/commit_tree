arm64: Convert __inval_cache_range() to area-based

__inval_cache_range() is already the odd one out among our data cache
maintenance routines as the only remaining range-based one; as we're
going to want an invalidation routine to call from C code for the pmem
API, let's tweak the prototype and name to bring it in line with the
clean operations, and to make its relationship with __dma_inv_area()
neatly mirror that of __clean_dcache_area_poc() and __dma_clean_area().
The loop clearing the early page tables gets mildly massaged in the
process for the sake of consistency.
