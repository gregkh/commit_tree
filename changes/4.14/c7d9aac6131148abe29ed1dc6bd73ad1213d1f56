x86/intel_rdt/cqm: Add mkdir support for RDT monitoring

Resource control groups can be created using mkdir in resctrl
fs(rdtgroup). In order to extend the resctrl interface to support
monitoring the control groups, extend the current mkdir to support
resource monitoring also.

This allows the rdtgroup created under the root directory to be able to
both control and monitor resources (ctrl_mon group). The ctrl_mon groups
are associated with one CLOSID like the legacy rdtgroups and one
RMID(Resource monitoring ID) as well. Hardware uses RMID to track the
resource usage. Once either of the CLOSID or RMID are exhausted, the
mkdir fails with -ENOSPC. If there are RMIDs in limbo list but not free
an -EBUSY is returned. User can also monitor a subset of the ctrl_mon
rdtgroup's tasks/cpus using the monitor groups. The monitor groups are
created using mkdir under the "mon_groups" directory in every ctrl_mon
group.

[Merged Tony's code: Removed a lot of common mkdir code, a fix to handling
of the list of the child rdtgroups and some cleanups in list
traversal. Also the changes to have similar alloc and free for CLOS/RMID
and return -EBUSY when RMIDs are in limbo and not free]
