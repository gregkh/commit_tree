ARM: dts: imx6qdl-apalis: imx6q-apalis-ixora: use i2c from dwc hdmi

Migrate to using functionally-reduced I2C master contained in the DWC
HDMI. Therefore drop the GPIO bitbanging based i2cddc definition and
modify resp. pinctrl.

While at it re-order the I2C aliases to start with the generic, followed
by the camera and concluded by the power I2C one.
