iio: accel: bmc150: Add support for BOSC0200 ACPI device id

Add support for the BOSC0200 ACPI device id used on some x86 tablets.
note driver_data is not set to a specific model, driver_data is not
used anyways (instead detection is done on the chip_id reg) and the
2 tablets with a BOSC0200 ACPI device id I've have 2 different chips,
one has a BMA250E, the other a BMA222E.
