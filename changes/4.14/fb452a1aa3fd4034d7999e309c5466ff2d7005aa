Revert "net: use lib/percpu_counter API for fragmentation mem accounting"

This reverts commit 6d7b857d541ecd1d9bd997c97242d4ef94b19de2.

There is a bug in fragmentation codes use of the percpu_counter API,
that can cause issues on systems with many CPUs.

The frag_mem_limit() just reads the global counter (fbc->count),
without considering other CPUs can have upto batch size (130K) that
haven't been subtracted yet.  Due to the 3MBytes lower thresh limit,
this become dangerous at >=24 CPUs (3*1024*1024/130000=24).

The correct API usage would be to use __percpu_counter_compare() which
does the right thing, and takes into account the number of (online)
CPUs and batch size, to account for this and call __percpu_counter_sum()
when needed.

We choose to revert the use of the lib/percpu_counter API for frag
memory accounting for several reasons:

1) On systems with CPUs > 24, the heavier fully locked
   __percpu_counter_sum() is always invoked, which will be more
   expensive than the atomic_t that is reverted to.

Given systems with more than 24 CPUs are becoming common this doesn't
seem like a good option.  To mitigate this, the batch size could be
decreased and thresh be increased.

2) The add_frag_mem_limit+sub_frag_mem_limit pairs happen on the RX
   CPU, before SKBs are pushed into sockets on remote CPUs.  Given
   NICs can only hash on L2 part of the IP-header, the NIC-RXq's will
   likely be limited.  Thus, a fair chance that atomic add+dec happen
   on the same CPU.

Revert note that commit 1d6119baf061 ("net: fix percpu memory leaks")
removed init_frag_mem_limit() and instead use inet_frags_init_net().
After this revert, inet_frags_uninit_net() becomes empty.
