of/device: Prevent buffer overflow in of_device_modalias()

As of_device_get_modalias() returns the number of bytes that would have
been written to the target string, regardless of how much did fit in the
buffer, it's possible that the returned index points beyond the buffer
passed to of_device_modalias() - causing memory beyond the buffer to be
null terminated.
