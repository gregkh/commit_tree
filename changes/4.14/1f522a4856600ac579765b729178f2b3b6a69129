selftests/memfd: add memfd_create hugetlbfs selftest

With the addition of hugetlbfs support in memfd_create, the memfd
selftests should verify correct functionality with hugetlbfs.

Instead of writing a separate memfd hugetlbfs test, modify the
memfd_test program to take an optional argument 'hugetlbfs'.  If the
hugetlbfs argument is specified, basic memfd_create functionality will
be exercised on hugetlbfs.  If hugetlbfs is not specified, the current
functionality of the test is unchanged.

Note that many of the tests in memfd_test test file sealing operations.
hugetlbfs does not support file sealing, therefore for hugetlbfs all
sealing related tests are skipped.

In order to test on hugetlbfs, there needs to be preallocated huge
pages.  A new script (run_tests) is added.  This script will first run
the existing memfd_create tests.  It will then, attempt to allocate the
required number of huge pages before running the hugetlbfs test.  At the
end of testing, it will release any huge pages allocated for testing
purposes.
