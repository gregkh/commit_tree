net: sched: fix use-after-free in tcf_action_destroy and tcf_del_walker

Recent commit d7fb60b9cafb ("net_sched: get rid of tcfa_rcu") removed
freeing in call_rcu, which changed already existing hard-to-hit
race condition into 100% hit:

[  598.599825] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000030
[  598.607782] IP: tcf_action_destroy+0xc0/0x140

Or:

[   40.858924] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000030
[   40.862840] IP: tcf_generic_walker+0x534/0x820

Fix this by storing the ops and use them directly for module_put call.
