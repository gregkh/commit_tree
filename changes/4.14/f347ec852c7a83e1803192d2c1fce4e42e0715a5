netfilter: nf_tables: fib: use skb_header_pointer

This is a preparatory patch for adding fib support to the netdev family.

The netdev family receives the packets from ingress hook. At this point
we have no guarantee that the ip header is linear. So this patch
replaces ip_hdr with skb_header_pointer in order to address that
possible situation.
