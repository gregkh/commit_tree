staging: lustre: uapi: move obd_ioctl_is_invalid() to linux-module.c

The inline function obd_ioctl_is_invalid() is no longer needed by
userland and also the function was pretty bug for a inline function.
Since this is the case we can move this kernel only code to the
linux-module.c which is the only place it is used.
