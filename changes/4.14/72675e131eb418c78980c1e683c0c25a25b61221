mm, memory_hotplug: drop zone from build_all_zonelists

build_all_zonelists gets a zone parameter to initialize zone's pagesets.
There is only a single user which gives a non-NULL zone parameter and
that one doesn't really need the rest of the build_all_zonelists (see
commit 6dcd73d7011b ("memory-hotplug: allocate zone's pcp before
onlining pages")).

Therefore remove setup_zone_pageset from build_all_zonelists and call it
from its only user directly.  This will also remove a pointless zonlists
rebuilding which is always good.
