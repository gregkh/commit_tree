ACPICA: Divergences: reduce access size definitions

The following commit introduces definition of access width to ACPICA.
  Commit: 2bece49394872d36bbc5767fd643deac05920c55
  Subject: ACPI: SPCR: Use access width to determine mmio usage

Actually the access bit width can be calculated via access width. It
would be better to define a macro calculating bit width rather than
defining fixed values. This patch thus cleans up the definitions to
reduce divergences.
