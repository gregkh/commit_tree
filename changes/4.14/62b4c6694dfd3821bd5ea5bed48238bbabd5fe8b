i40e: Add programming descriptors to cleaned_count

This patch updates the i40e driver to include programming descriptors in
the cleaned_count. Without this change it becomes possible for us to leak
memory as we don't trigger a large enough allocation when the time comes to
allocate new buffers and we end up overwriting a number of rx_buffers equal
to the number of programming descriptors we encountered.
