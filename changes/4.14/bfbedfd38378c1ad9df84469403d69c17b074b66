net/smc: terminate link group if out-of-sync is received

An out-of-sync condition can just be detected by the client.
If the server receives a CLC DECLINE message indicating an out-of-sync
condition for the link groups, the server must clean up the out-of-sync
link group.
There is no need for an extra third parameter in smc_clc_send_decline().
