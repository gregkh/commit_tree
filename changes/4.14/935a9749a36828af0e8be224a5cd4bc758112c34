ip_gre: get key from session_id correctly in erspan_rcv

erspan only uses the first 10 bits of session_id as the key to look
up the tunnel. But in erspan_rcv, it missed 'session_id & ID_MASK'
when getting the key from session_id.

If any other flag is also set in session_id in a packet, it would
fail to find the tunnel due to incorrect key in erspan_rcv.

This patch is to add 'session_id & ID_MASK' there and also remove
the unnecessary variable session_id.
