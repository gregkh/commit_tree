ALSA: timer: Add missing mutex lock for compat ioctls

The races among ioctl and other operations were protected by the
commit af368027a49a ("ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls") and
later fixes, but one code path was forgotten in the scenario: the
32bit compat ioctl.  As syzkaller recently spotted, a very similar
use-after-free may happen with the combination of compat ioctls.

The fix is simply to apply the same ioctl_lock to the compat_ioctl
callback, too.
