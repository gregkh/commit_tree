drm/amd/powerplay: rv: Use designated initializers

As done for vega10 in commit 3ddd396f6b57 ("drm/amd/powerplay: Use
designated initializers") mark other tableFunction entries with designated
initializers. The randstruct plugin requires designated initializers for
structures that are entirely function pointers.
