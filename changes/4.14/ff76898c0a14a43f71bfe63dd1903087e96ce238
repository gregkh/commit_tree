cpufreq: dt-platdev: Add some missing platforms to the blacklist

Commit edeec420de24 (cpufreq: dt-platdev: Automatically create cpufreq
device with OPP v2) missed adding few platforms to the blacklist which
create the cpufreq-dt device from their own drivers, after some
dependencies are sorted out.

And for those platforms, both the platform specific driver and the
cpufreq-dt-platdev driver try to create the cpufreq-dt device now.

Fix that by including those platforms in the blacklist. This doesn't include
the TI platforms, for which there is a separate patch.
