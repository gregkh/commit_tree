drm/i915: Fix bad comparison in skl_compute_plane_wm, v2.

ddb_allocation && ddb_allocation / blocks_per_line >= 1 is the same
as ddb_allocation >= blocks_per_line, so use the latter to simplify
this.

This fixes the following compiler warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:4467]: (warning) Comparison of a
boolean expression with an integer other than 0 or 1.

Changes since v1:
- Rebase, was missing the changes to the macro names.
