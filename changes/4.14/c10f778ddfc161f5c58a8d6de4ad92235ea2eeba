fs: fix performance regression in clean_bdev_aliases()

Commit e64855c6cfaa ("fs: Add helper to clean bdev aliases under a bh
and use it") added a wrapper for clean_bdev_aliases() that invalidates
bdev aliases underlying a single buffer head.

However this has caused a performance regression for bonnie++ benchmark
on ext4 filesystem when delayed allocation is turned off (ext3 mode) -
average of 3 runs:

  Hmean SeqOut Char  164787.55 (  0.00%) 107189.06 (-34.95%)
  Hmean SeqOut Block 219883.89 (  0.00%) 168870.32 (-23.20%)

The reason for this regression is that clean_bdev_aliases() is slower
when called for a single block because pagevec_lookup() it uses will end
up iterating through the radix tree until it finds a page (which may
take a while) but we are only interested whether there's a page at a
particular index.

Fix the problem by using pagevec_lookup_range() instead which avoids the
needless iteration.
