string.h: un-fortify memcpy_and_pad

The way I'd implemented the new helper memcpy_and_pad  with
__FORTIFY_INLINE caused compiler warnings for certain kernel
configurations.

This helper is only used in a single place at this time, and thus
doesn't benefit much from fortification. So simplify the code
by dropping fortification support for now.
