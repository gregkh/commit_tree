rds: reduce memory footprint for RDS when transport is RDMA

RDS over IB does not use multipath RDS, so the array
of additional rds_conn_path structures is always superfluous
in this case. Reduce the memory footprint of the rds module
by making this a dynamic allocation predicated on whether
the transport is mp_capable.
