drm: rcar-du: Use the VBK interrupt for vblank events

When implementing support for interlaced modes, the driver switched from
reporting vblank events on the vertical blanking (VBK) interrupt to the
frame end interrupt (FRM). This incorrectly divided the reported refresh
rate by two. Fix it by moving back to the VBK interrupt.
