lib/interval_tree: fast overlap detection

Allow interval trees to quickly check for overlaps to avoid unnecesary
tree lookups in interval_tree_iter_first().

As of this patch, all interval tree flavors will require using a
'rb_root_cached' such that we can have the leftmost node easily
available.  While most users will make use of this feature, those with
special functions (in addition to the generic insert, delete, search
calls) will avoid using the cached option as they can do funky things
with insertions -- for example, vma_interval_tree_insert_after().
