mlxsw: spectrum_router: Only handle IPv4 and IPv6 events

The driver doesn't support events from address families other than IPv4
and IPv6, so ignore them. Otherwise, we risk queueing a work item before
it's initialized.

This can happen in case a VRF is configured when MROUTE_MULTIPLE_TABLES
is enabled, as the VRF driver will try to add an l3mdev rule for the
IPMR family.
