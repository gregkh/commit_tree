rcu: Add warning to rcu_idle_enter() for irqs enabled

All current callers of rcu_idle_enter() have irqs disabled, and
rcu_idle_enter() relies on this, but doesn't check.  This commit
therefore adds a RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN() to add some verification to the trust.
While we are there, pass "true" rather than "1" to rcu_eqs_enter().
