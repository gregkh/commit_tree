Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix rescind handling issues

This patch handles the following issues that were observed when we are
handling racing channel offer message and rescind message for the same
offer:

1. Since the host does not respond to messages on a rescinded channel,
in the current code, we could be indefinitely blocked on the vmbus_open() call.

2. When a rescinded channel is being closed, if there is a pending interrupt on the
channel, we could end up freeing the channel that the interrupt handler would run on.
