ARC: [plat-hsdk] initial port for HSDK board

This initial port adds support of ARC HS Development Kit board with some
basic features such serial port, USB, SD/MMC and Ethernet.

Essentially we run Linux kernel on all 4 cores (i.e. utilize SMP) and
heavily use IO Coherency for speeding-up DMA-aware peripherals.

Note as opposed to other ARC boards we link Linux kernel to
0x9000_0000 intentionally because cores 1 and 3 configured with DCCM
situated at our more usual link base 0x8000_0000. We still can use
memory region starting at 0x8000_0000 as we reallocate DCCM in our
platform code.

Note that PAE remapping for DMA clients does not work due to an RTL bug,
so CREG_PAE register must be programmed to all zeroes, otherwise it will
cause problems with DMA to/from peripherals even if PAE40 is not used.
