spi: spi-ep93xx: use 32-bit read/write for all registers

All the EP93xx SSP registers are 32-bit. Since most of the upper bits
are unused, this driver tries to be tricky and uses 8 or 16-bit I/O to
access the registers. This really just adds a bit of confusion.

Simplify the I/O by using 32-bit read/write's for all of the registers.
