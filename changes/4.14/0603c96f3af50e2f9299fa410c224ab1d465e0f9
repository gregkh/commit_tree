SMB: Validate negotiate (to protect against downgrade) even if signing off

As long as signing is supported (ie not a guest user connection) and
connection is SMB3 or SMB3.02, then validate negotiate (protect
against man in the middle downgrade attacks).  We had been doing this
only when signing was required, not when signing was just enabled,
but this more closely matches recommended SMB3 behavior and is
better security.  Suggested by Metze.
