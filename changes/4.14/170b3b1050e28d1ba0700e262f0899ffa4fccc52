tracing: Apply trace_clock changes to instance max buffer

Currently trace_clock timestamps are applied to both regular and max
buffers only for global trace. For instance trace, trace_clock
timestamps are applied only to regular buffer. But, regular and max
buffers can be swapped, for example, following a snapshot. So, for
instance trace, bad timestamps can be seen following a snapshot.
Let's apply trace_clock timestamps to instance max buffer as well.
