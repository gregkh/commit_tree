media: isl6421: add checks for current overflow

This Kaffeine's BZ:
	https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374693

affects SkyStar S2 PCI DVB-S/S2 rev 3.3 device. It could be due to
a Kernel bug.

While checking the Isil 6421, comparing with its manual, available at:

	http://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/isl6/isl6421a.pdf

It was noticed that, if the output load is highly capacitive, a different approach
is recomended when energizing the LNBf.

Also, it is possible to detect if a current overload is happening, by checking an
special flag.

Add support for it.

Tested on Skystar S2. Changes respect override_or option so should still work fine
on cx88 based cards which disable dynamic current limit.

Changes since v1:
v2 - fixed incorrect checking of i2c return values
v3 - fix if logic to check if dcl needs re-enabling
   - respect override_or values which aim to disable dcl
   - only do long sleep on overload if dcl enabled
   - add short sleep before re-enabling dcl
   - only check overload and potentially return EINVAL if device is on
v4 - revert v3 sleep logic changes to remove tuning delays
