x86/io: Make readq() / writeq() API consistent

Despite the following commit:

  93093d099e5d ("x86: provide readq()/writeq() on 32-bit too, complete")

which says:

  ...Also, map all the APIs to the strongest ordering variant. It's way
  too easy to mess such details up in drivers and the difference between
  "memory" and "" constrained asm() constructs is in the noise range.

... we have for now only one user of this API (i.e. writeq_relaxed() in
drivers/hwtracing/intel_th/sth.c) on x86 and it does care about
"relaxed" part of it.

Moreover 32-bit support has been removed from that header, though appeared
later in specific headers that emphasizes its non-atomic context.

The rest should keep in mind a consistent picture of the __raw_IO() vs. IO()
vs. IO_relaxed() API.
