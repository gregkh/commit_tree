IB/mlx5: Expose software parsing for Raw Ethernet QP

Software parsing (SWP) is a feature that can be used to instruct the
device to stop using its internal parser and to parse packets on the
transmit path according to offsets set for each packets.

Through this feature, the device allows the handling of checksum and
LSO by the hardware according to the location of IP and TCP/UDP
headers.

Enable SW parsing on Raw Ethernet send queue by default if firmware
supports it and report these capabilities to user space.
