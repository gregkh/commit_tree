powerpc/time: refactor MFTB() to limit number of ifdefs

The 8xx cannot access the TBL and TBU registers using mfspr/mtspr
It must be accessed using mftb/mftbu

Due to this, there is a number of places with #ifdef CONFIG_8xx

This patch defines new macros MFTBL(x) and MFTBU(x) on the same model
as MFTB(x) and tries to make use of them as much as possible.

In arch/powerpc/include/asm/timex.h, we also remove the ifdef
for the asm() operands as the compiler doesn't mind unused operands
