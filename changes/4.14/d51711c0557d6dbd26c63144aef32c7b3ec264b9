ip_gre: ipgre_tap device should keep dst

Without keeping dst, the tunnel will not update any mtu/pmtu info,
since it does not have a dst on the skb.

Reproducer:
  client(ipgre_tap1 - eth1) <-----> (eth1 - ipgre_tap1)server

After reducing eth1's mtu on client, then perforamnce became 0.

This patch is to netif_keep_dst in gre_tap_init, as ipgre does.
