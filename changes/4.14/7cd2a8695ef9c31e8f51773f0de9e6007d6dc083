powerpc/mm: Properly invalidate when setting process table base

The host process table base is stored in the partition table by calling
the function native_register_process_table(). Currently this just sets
the entry in memory and is missing a subsequent cache invalidation
instruction. Any update to the partition table should be followed by a
cache invalidation instruction specifying invalidation of the caching of
any partition table entries (RIC = 2, PRS = 0).

We already have a function to update the partition table with the
required cache invalidation instructions - mmu_partition_table_set_entry().
Update the native_register_process_table() function to call
mmu_partition_table_set_entry(), this ensures all appropriate
invalidation will be performed.
