ACPICA: Dispatch active GPEs at init time

In some cases GPEs are already active when they are enabled by
acpi_ev_initialize_gpe_block() and whatever happens next may depend
on the result of handling the events signaled by them, so the
events should not be discarded (which is what happens currently) and
they should be handled as soon as reasonably possible.

For this reason, modify acpi_ev_initialize_gpe_block() to
dispatch GPEs with the status flag set in-band right after
enabling them.
