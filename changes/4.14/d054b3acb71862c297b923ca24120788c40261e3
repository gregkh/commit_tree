tty: amba-pl011: constify vendor_data structures

These vendor_data structures are only stored in the vendor field of
the uart_amba_port structure, as defined in the same file, and this
field is declared as const.  Thus the vendor_data structures can be
const too.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
