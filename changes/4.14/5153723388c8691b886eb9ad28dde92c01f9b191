KVM: x86: fix clang build

Clang resolves __builtin_constant_p() to false even if the expression is
constant in the end.  The only purpose of that expression was to
differentiate a case where the following expression couldn't be checked
at compile-time, so we can just remove the check.

Clang handles the following two correctly.  Turn it into BUG_ON if there
are any more problems with this.
