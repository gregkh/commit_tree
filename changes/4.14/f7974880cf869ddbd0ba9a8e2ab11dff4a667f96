sync_file: Return consistent status in SYNC_IOC_FILE_INFO

sync_file_ioctl_fence_info has a race between filling the status
of the underlying fences and the overall status of the sync_file.
If fence transitions in the time frame between its sync_fill_fence_info
and the later dma_fence_is_signaled for the sync_file, the returned
information is inconsistent showing non-signaled underlying fences but
an overall signaled state.

This patch changes sync_file_ioctl_fence_info to track what has been
encoded and using that as the overall sync_file status.
