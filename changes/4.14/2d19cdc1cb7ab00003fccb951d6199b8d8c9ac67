usb: gadget: f_midi: Use snd_card_free_when_closed with refcount

Currenly, f_midi_free uses snd_card_free, which will wait
until the user has released the sound card before
returning. However, if the user doesn't release the sound
card, then f_midi_free can block for an arbitrary amount
of time, which also blocks any gadget operations on that
thread.

Instead, we can use snd_card_free_when_closed which returns
before all handles are released. Since f_midi can be
accessed through rmidi if usb_put_function is called before
release_card_device, add refcounting to f_midi_free and
have rawmidi's private free call it. The f_midi memory
is only kfreed when usb_put_function and release_card_device
have both been called.
