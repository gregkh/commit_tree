usb: phy: tegra: Fix phy suspend for UDC

Commit dfebb5f43a78 ("usb: chipidea: Add support for Tegra20/30/114/124")
added UDC support for Tegra but with UDC support enabled, is was found
that Tegra30, Tegra114 and Tegra124 would hang on entry to suspend.

The hang occurred during the suspend of the USB PHY when the Tegra PHY
driver attempted to disable the PHY clock. The problem is that before
the Tegra PHY driver is suspended, the chipidea driver already disabled
the PHY clock and when the Tegra PHY driver suspended, it could not read
DEVLC register and caused the device to hang.

The Tegra USB PHY driver is used by both the Tegra EHCI driver and now
the chipidea UDC driver and so simply removing the disabling of the PHY
clock from the USB PHY driver would not work for the Tegra EHCI driver.
Fortunately, the status of the USB PHY clock can be read from the
USB_SUSP_CTRL register and therefore, to workaround this issue, simply
poll the register prior to disabling the clock in USB PHY driver to see
if clock gating has already been initiated. Please note that it can take
a few uS for the clock to disable and so simply reading this status
register once on entry is not sufficient.

Similarly when turning on the PHY clock, it is possible that the clock
is already enabled or in the process of being enabled, and so check for
this when enabling the PHY.

Please note that no issues are seen with Tegra20 because it has a slightly
different PHY to Tegra30/114/124.
