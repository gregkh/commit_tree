netvsc: propagate MAC address change to VF slave

If VF is slaved to synthetic device, then any change to netvsc
MAC address should be propagated to the slave device.

If slave device doesn't support MAC address change then it
should also be an error to attempt to change synthetic NIC MAC
address.

It also fixes the error unwind in the original code.
If give a bad address, the old code would change the device
MAC address anyway.
