i40e: separate hw_features from runtime changing flags

The number of flags found in pf->flags has grown quite large, and there
are a lot of different types of flags. Most of the flags are simply
hardware features which are enabled on some firmware or some MAC types.
Other flags are dynamic run-time flags which enable or disable certain
features of the driver.

Separate these two types of flags into pf->hw_features and pf->flags.
The hw_features list will contain a set of features which are enabled at
init time. This will not contain toggles or otherwise dynamically
changing features. These flags should not need atomic protections, as
they will be set once during init and then be essentially read only.

Everything else will remain in the flags variable. These flags may be
modified at any time during run time. A future patch may wish to convert
these flags into set_bit/clear_bit/test_bit or similar approach to
ensure atomic correctness.

The I40E_FLAG_MFP_ENABLED flag may be a good fit for hw_features but
currently is used by ethtool in the private flags settings, and thus has
been left as part of flags.

Additionally, I40E_FLAG_DCB_CAPABLE may be a good fit for the
hw_features but this patch has not tried to untangle it yet.
