staging: lustre: uapi: return error code for ostid_set_id

Currently the function ostid_set_id() just logs an error
and just keeps going. This function is also used by user
land tools so having special lustre kernel debugging
code is not desired. So instead just return an error
code and have the calling kernel code print the error
instead.
