MIPS: VDSO: Drop gic_get_usm_range() usage

We don't really need gic_get_usm_range() to abstract discovery of the
address of the GIC user-visible section now that we have access to its
base address globally.

Switch to calculating it ourselves, which will allow us to stop
requiring the irqchip driver to care about a counter exposed to userland
for use via the VDSO.
