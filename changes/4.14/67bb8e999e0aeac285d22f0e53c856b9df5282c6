x86/mm: Disable various instrumentations of mm/mem_encrypt.c and mm/tlb.c

Some routines in mem_encrypt.c are called very early in the boot process,
e.g. sme_enable().  When CONFIG_KCOV=y is defined the resulting code added
to sme_enable() (and others) for KCOV instrumentation results in a kernel
crash.  Disable the KCOV instrumentation for mem_encrypt.c by adding
KCOV_INSTRUMENT_mem_encrypt.o := n to arch/x86/mm/Makefile.

In order to avoid other possible early boot issues, model mem_encrypt.c
after head64.c in regards to tools. In addition to disabling KCOV as
stated above and a previous patch that disables branch profiling, also
remove the "-pg" CFLAG if CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER is enabled and set
KASAN_SANITIZE to "n", each of which are done on a file basis.
