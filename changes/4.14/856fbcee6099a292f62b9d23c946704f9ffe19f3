MIPS: Store core & VP IDs in GlobalNumber-style variable

This patch modifies the way we store core & VP IDs such that we store
them in a single 32 bit integer whose format matches that of the MIPSr6
GlobalNumber register. Whereas we have previously stored core & VP IDs
in separate fields, storing them in a single GlobalNumber-like field:

  1) Reduces the size of struct cpuinfo_mips by 4 bytes, and will allow
     it to not grow when cluster support is added.

  2) Gives us a natural place to store cluster number, which matches up
     with what the architecture provides.

  3) Will be useful in the future as a parameter to the MIPSr6 GINVI
     instruction to specify a target CPU whose icache that instruction
     should operate on.

The cpu_set*() accessor functions are moved out of the asm/cpu-info.h
header in order to allow them to use the WARN_ON macro, which is
unusable in asm/cpu-info.h due to include ordering.
