powerpc/44x: Move 44x machine check handlers into platforms/44x

We have several 44x machine check handlers defined in traps.c. It would
be preferable if they were split out with the platforms that use them.
Do that.

In the process, drop get_mc_reason() and instead just open code the
lookup of reason from regs->dsisr. This avoids a pointless layer of
abstraction.

We know to use regs->dsisr because 44x enables BOOKE which enables
PPC_ADV_DEBUG_REGS, and FSL_BOOKE is not enabled on 44x builds.
