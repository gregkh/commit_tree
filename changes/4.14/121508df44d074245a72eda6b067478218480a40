cgroup: export fhandle info for a cgroup

Add an API to export cgroup fhandle info. We don't export a full 'struct
file_handle', there are unrequired info. Sepcifically, cgroup is always
a directory, so we don't need a 'FILEID_INO32_GEN_PARENT' type fhandle,
we only need export the inode number and generation number just like
what generic_fh_to_dentry does. And we can avoid the overhead of getting
an inode too, since kernfs_node_id (ino and generation) has all the info
required.
