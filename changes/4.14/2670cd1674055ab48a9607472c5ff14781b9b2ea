doc, block, bfq: better describe how to properly configure bfq

Many users have reported the lack of an HOWTO for properly configuring
bfq as a function of the goal one wants to achieve (max
responsiveness, max throughput, ...). In fact, all needed details are
already provided in the documentation file bfq-iosched.txt. Yet the
document lacks guidance on which parameter descriptions to look
at. This commit adds some simple direction.
