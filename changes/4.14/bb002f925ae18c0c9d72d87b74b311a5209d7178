ASoC: rsnd: rsnd_ssi_can_output_clk() macro

For example SSI0/SSI1 case, SSI1 can share pin with SSI0.
And then, SSI1 needs SSI0's clock.
This clock controlling is very picky and difficult to understand
in current code.

This patch adds new rsnd_ssi_can_output_clk() macro,
the code will be more understandable.
