drm/i915: Always perform internal fixed16 division in 64 bits

This patch combines fixed_16_16_div & fixed_16_16_div_u64 wrappers.
And new fixed_16_16_div wrapper always performs division operation in
u64 internally, to avoid any data loss which was happening in earlier
version of wrapper.
earlier wrapper was converting u32 to fixed16 in 32 bit so we were
losing 16-MSB data.
