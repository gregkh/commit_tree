of: provide inline helper for of_find_device_by_node

The ipmmu-vmsa driver fails in compile-testing on non-OF platforms:

drivers/iommu/ipmmu-vmsa.o: In function `ipmmu_of_xlate':
ipmmu-vmsa.c:(.text+0x740): undefined reference to `of_find_device_by_node'

It would be reasonable to assume that this interface works but
returns failure on non-OF builds, like it does on machines that
have been booted in another way, so this adds another inline
function helper.
