gso: fix payload length when gso_size is zero

When gso_size reset to zero for the tail segment in skb_segment(), later
in ipv6_gso_segment(), __skb_udp_tunnel_segment() and gre_gso_segment()
we will get incorrect results (payload length, pcsum) for that segment.
inet_gso_segment() already has a check for gso_size before calculating
payload.

The issue was found with LTP vxlan & gre tests over ixgbe NIC.
