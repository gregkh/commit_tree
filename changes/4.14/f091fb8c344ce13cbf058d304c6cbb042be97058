scsi: scsi_transport_fc: Also check for NOTPRESENT in fc_remote_port_add()

During failover there is a small race window between fc_remote_port_add()
and fc_timeout_deleted_rport(); the latter drops the lock after setting the
port to NOTPRESENT, so if fc_remote_port_add() is called right at that time
it will fail to detect the existing rport and happily adding a new
structure, causing rports to get registered twice.
