ext4: reduce lock contention in __ext4_new_inode

While running number of creating file threads concurrently,
we found heavy lock contention on group spinlock:

most of cpu time blames to _raw_spin_lock, here is some testing
numbers with/without patch.

Test environment:
Server : SuperMicro Sever (2 x E5-2690 v3@2.60GHz, 128GB 2133MHz
         DDR4 Memory, 8GbFC)
Storage : 2 x RAID1 (DDN SFA7700X, 4 x Toshiba PX02SMU020 200GB
          Read Intensive SSD)

format command:
        mkfs.ext4 -J size=4096

test command:
        mpirun -np 48 mdtest -n 30000 -d /ext4/mdtest.out -F -C \
                -r -i 1 -v -p 10 -u #first run to load inode

        mpirun -np 48 mdtest -n 30000 -d /ext4/mdtest.out -F -C \
                -r -i 3 -v -p 10 -u

Kernel version: 4.13.0-rc3

Test  1,440,000 files with 48 directories by 48 processes:

Without patch:

File Creation   File removal
79,033          289,569 ops/per second
81,463          285,359
79,875          288,475

With patch:
File Creation   File removal
810669		301694
812805		302711
813965		297670

Creation performance is improved more than 10X with large
journal size. The main problem here is we test bitmap
and do some check and journal operations which could be
slept, then we test and set with lock hold, this could
be racy, and make 'inode' steal by other process.

However, after first try, we could confirm handle has
been started and inode bitmap journaled too, then
we could find and set bit with lock hold directly, this
will mostly gurateee success with second try.
