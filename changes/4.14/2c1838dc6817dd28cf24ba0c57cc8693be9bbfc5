binder: protect binder_ref with outer lock

Use proc->outer_lock to protect the binder_ref structure.
The outer lock allows functions operating on the binder_ref
to do nested acquires of node and inner locks as necessary
to attach refs to nodes atomically.

Binder refs must never be accesssed without holding the
outer lock.
