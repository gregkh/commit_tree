xen/pvcalls: implement release command

Release both active and passive sockets. For active sockets, make sure
to avoid possible conflicts with the ioworker reading/writing to those
sockets concurrently. Set map->release to let the ioworker know
atomically that the socket will be released soon, then wait until the
ioworker finishes (flush_work).

Unmap indexes pages and data rings.
