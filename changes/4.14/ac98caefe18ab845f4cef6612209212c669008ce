mmc: sunxi: Add support for A83T eMMC (MMC2)

The third MMC controller (MMC2) on the Allwinner A83T SoC is slightly
different. It supports a wider 8-bit bus, has a dedicated controllable
reset pin for eMMC, and a "new timing mode" which is supposed to deliver
better signals and thus better performance.

Add a compatible for this one to use the new timing mode not found in the
other controllers.
