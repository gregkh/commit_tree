net/mlx5e: Fix erroneous freeing of encap header buffer

In case the neighbour for the tunnel destination isn't valid,
we send a neighbour update request but we free the encap
header buffer. This is wrong, because we still need it for
allocating a HW encap entry once the neighbour is available.

Fix that by skipping freeing it if we wait for neighbour.
