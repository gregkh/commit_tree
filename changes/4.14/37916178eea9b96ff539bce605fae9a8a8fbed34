MIPS: CPS: Read GIC_VL_IDENT directly, not via irqchip driver

Rather than calling the gic_read_local_vp_id() function from the GIC
irqchip driver, call read_gic_vl_ident() to read the GIC_VL_IDENT
register directly. This will allow us to remove gic_read_local_vp_id()
from the irqchip driver in a further patch, since that driver doesn't
actually care about the register's value.
