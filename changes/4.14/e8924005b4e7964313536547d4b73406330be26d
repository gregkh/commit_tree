mfd: Add STM32 LPTimer driver

STM32 Low-Power Timer hardware block can be used for:
- PWM generation
- IIO trigger (in sync with PWM)
- IIO quadrature encoder counter
PWM and IIO timer configuration are mixed in the same registers so
we need a multi fonction driver to be able to share those registers.
