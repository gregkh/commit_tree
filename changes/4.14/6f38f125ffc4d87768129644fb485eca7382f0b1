spi: qup: hide warning for uninitialized variable

The added conditionals in this function apparently confused
gcc to the point that it no longer sees the code is safe and
instead shows a false-positive warning:

drivers/spi/spi-qup.c: In function 'spi_qup_transfer_one':
drivers/spi/spi-qup.c:507:28: error: 'tx_nents' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/spi/spi-qup.c:464:17: note: 'tx_nents' was declared here
drivers/spi/spi-qup.c:505:28: error: 'rx_nents' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/spi/spi-qup.c:464:7: note: 'rx_nents' was declared here

This moves the initialization to a place that makes it obvious
to the compiler.
