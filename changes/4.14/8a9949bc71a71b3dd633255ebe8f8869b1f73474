x86/xen/64: Rearrange the SYSCALL entries

Xen's raw SYSCALL entries are much less weird than native.  Rather
than fudging them to look like native entries, use the Xen-provided
stack frame directly.

This lets us eliminate entry_SYSCALL_64_after_swapgs and two uses of
the SWAPGS_UNSAFE_STACK paravirt hook.  The SYSENTER code would
benefit from similar treatment.

This makes one change to the native code path: the compat
instruction that clears the high 32 bits of %rax is moved slightly
later.  I'd be surprised if this affects performance at all.
