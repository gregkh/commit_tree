arm64: mm: Use READ_ONCE when dereferencing pointer to pte table

On kernels built with support for transparent huge pages, different CPUs
can access the PMD concurrently due to e.g. fast GUP or page_vma_mapped_walk
and they must take care to use READ_ONCE to avoid value tearing or caching
of stale values by the compiler. Unfortunately, these functions call into
our pgtable macros, which don't use READ_ONCE, and compiler caching has
been observed to cause the following crash during ext4 writeback:

PC is at check_pte+0x20/0x170
LR is at page_vma_mapped_walk+0x2e0/0x540

This is because page_vma_mapped_walk loads the PMD twice before calling
pte_offset_map: the first time without READ_ONCE (where it gets all zeroes
due to a concurrent pmdp_invalidate) and the second time with READ_ONCE
(where it sees a valid table pointer due to a concurrent pmd_populate).
However, the compiler inlines everything and caches the first value in
a register, which is subsequently used in pte_offset_phys which returns
a junk pointer that is later dereferenced when attempting to access the
relevant pte.

This patch fixes the issue by using READ_ONCE in pte_offset_phys to ensure
that a stale value is not used. Whilst this is a point fix for a known
failure (and simple to backport), a full fix moving all of our page table
accessors over to {READ,WRITE}_ONCE and consistently using READ_ONCE in
page_vma_mapped_walk is in the works for a future kernel release.
