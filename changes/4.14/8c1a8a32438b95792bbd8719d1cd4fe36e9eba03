KVM: arm64: its: Fix missing dynamic allocation check in scan_its_table

We currently allocate an entry dynamically, but we never check if the
allocation actually succeeded.  We actually don't need a dynamic
allocation, because we know the maximum size of an ITS table entry, so
we can simply use an allocation on the stack.
