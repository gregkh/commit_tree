ixgbe: Enable LASI interrupts for X552 devices

Enable LASI interrupts on X552 devices in order to receive notifications of
link configurations of the external PHY and support the configuration of
the internal iXFI link since iXFI does not support auto-negotiation.  This
is not required for X553 devices; add a check to avoid enabling LASI
interrupts for X553 devices.
