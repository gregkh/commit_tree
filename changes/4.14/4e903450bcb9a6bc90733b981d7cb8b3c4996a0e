clk: sunxi: fix uninitialized access

gcc-8 reports an uninitialized variable access in a code path
that we would see with incorrect DTB input:

drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sun8i-bus-gates.c: In function 'sun8i_h3_bus_gates_init':
drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sun8i-bus-gates.c:85:27: error: 'clk_parent' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This works around by skipping invalid input and printing a warning
instead if it ever happens. The problem was apparently part of the
initiali driver submission, but older compilers don't notice it.
