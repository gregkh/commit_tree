netvsc: change order of steps in setting queues

This fixes the error unwind logic for incorrect number of queues.
If netif_set_real_num_XX_queues failed then rndis_filter_device_add
would have been called twice. Since input arguments are already
ranged checked this is a hypothetical only problem, not possible
in actual code.
