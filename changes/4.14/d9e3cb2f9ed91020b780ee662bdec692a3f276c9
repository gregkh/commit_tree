alpha: math-emu: Fix modular build

Commit 00fc0e0dda62 ("alpha: move exports to actual definitions") also
removed the exports of the math emulator hooks, which are defined in C
code.  In case anyone cares about the option of CONFIG_MATHEMU=m, add
exports next to those definitions.  Also add a MODULE_LICENSE.
