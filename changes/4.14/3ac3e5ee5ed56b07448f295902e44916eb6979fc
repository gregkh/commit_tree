iommu/amd: Copy old trans table from old kernel

Here several things need be done:
- If iommu is pre-enabled in a normal kernel, just disable it and print
  warning.

- If any one of IOMMUs is not pre-enabled in kdump kernel, just continue
  as it does in normal kernel.

- If failed to copy dev table of old kernel, continue to proceed as
  it does in normal kernel.

- Only if all IOMMUs are pre-enabled and copy dev table is done well, free
  the dev table allocated in early_amd_iommu_init() and make amd_iommu_dev_table
  point to the copied one.

- Disable and Re-enable event/cmd buffer,  install the copied DTE table
  to reg, and detect and enable guest vapic.

- Flush all caches
