ibmvnic: Check for transport event on driver resume

On resume, the ibmvnic driver will fail to resume normal operation.
The main crq gets closed on suspend by the vnic server and doesn't get
reopened again as the interrupt for the transport event that would reset
the main crq comes in after the driver has been suspended.

This patch resolves the issue by removing the calls to kick the receive
interrupts handlers and instead directly invoking the main crq interrupt
handler. This will ensure that we see the transport event necessary to
properly resume the driver.
