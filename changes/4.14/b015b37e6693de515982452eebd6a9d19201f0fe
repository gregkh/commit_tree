PCI: artpec6: Stop enabling writes to DBI read-only registers

Previously we enabled writes to the DBI read-only registers so the Class
Code fix in dw_pcie_setup_rc() would work.  But now dw_pcie_setup_rc()
enables write permission itself, so we don't need to do it here.

Stop enabling writes to the DBI read-only registers.
