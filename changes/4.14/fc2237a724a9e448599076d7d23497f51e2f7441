HID: introduce hid_is_using_ll_driver

Although HID itself is transport-agnostic, occasionally a driver may
want to interact with the low-level transport that a device is connected
through. To do this, we need to know what kind of bus is in use. The
first guess may be to look at the 'bus' field of the 'struct hid_device',
but this field may be emulated in some cases (e.g. uhid).

More ideally, we can check which ll_driver a device is using. This
function introduces a 'hid_is_using_ll_driver' function and makes the
'struct hid_ll_driver' of the four most common transports accessible
through hid.h.
