net_sched: refactor notification code for RTM_DELTFILTER

It is confusing to use 'unsigned long fh' as both a handle
and a pointer, especially commit 9ee7837449b3
("net sched filters: fix notification of filter delete with proper handle").

This patch introduces tfilter_del_notify() so that we can
pass it as a pointer as before, and we don't need to check
RTM_DELTFILTER in tcf_fill_node() any more.

This prepares for the next patch.
