sched: sfq: drop packets after root qdisc lock is released

The commit 520ac30f4551 ("net_sched: drop packets after root qdisc lock
is released) made a big change of tc for performance. But there are
some points which are not changed in SFQ enqueue operation.
1. Fail to find the SFQ hash slot;
2. When the queue is full;

Now use qdisc_drop instead free skb directly.
