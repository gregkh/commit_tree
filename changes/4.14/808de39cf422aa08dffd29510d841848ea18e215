rcutorture: Add task's CPU for rcutorture writer stalls

It appears that at least some of the rcutorture writer stall messages
coincide with unusually long CPU-online operations, for example, no
fewer than 205 seconds in a recent test.  It is of course possible that
the writer stall is not unrelated to this unusually long CPU-hotplug
operation, and so this commit adds the rcutorture writer task's CPU to
the stall message to gain more information about this possible connection.
