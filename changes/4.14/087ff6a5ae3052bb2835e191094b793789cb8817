powerpc/pseries: Fix "OF: ERROR: Bad of_node_put() on /cpus" during DLPAR

Commit 215ee763f8cb ("powerpc: pseries: remove dlpar_attach_node
dependency on full path") reworked dlpar_attach_node() to no longer
look up the parent node "/cpus", but instead to have the parent node
passed by the caller in the function parameter list.

As a result dlpar_attach_node() is no longer responsible for freeing
the reference to the parent node. However, commit 215ee763f8cb failed
to remove the of_node_put(parent) call in dlpar_attach_node(), or to
take into account that the reference to the parent in the caller
dlpar_cpu_add() needs to be held until after dlpar_attach_node()
returns.

As a result doing repeated cpu add/remove dlpar operations will
eventually result in the following error:

  OF: ERROR: Bad of_node_put() on /cpus

Fix the issue by removing the of_node_put(parent) call from
dlpar_attach_node(), and ensuring that the reference to the parent
node is properly held and released by the caller dlpar_cpu_add().
