spmi: pmic-arb: Move the ownership check to irq_chip callback

Check the irq ownership in the irq_request_resources callback
instead of checking it during the irq mapping. This can prevent
installing the flow handler for the interrupt that is not owned by the EE
and allow the irq translation during the gpio driver probe.
