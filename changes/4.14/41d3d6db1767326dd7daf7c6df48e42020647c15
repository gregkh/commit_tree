perf vendor events: Add Skylake server uncore event list

Add JSON uncore events for Skylake Server to perf.

Based on JSON list V1.01

This is a much fuller list than with earlier uncores, including
more low level (but also harder to understand) events. It does not
include the "experimential" events. The previous
high level metric (LLC_* etc.) are still available when applicable.
C state power events are not included at this point.
