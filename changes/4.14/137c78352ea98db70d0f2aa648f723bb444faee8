ACPICA: Resources: Allow _DMA method in walk resources

ACPICA commit af661c00afac7aa481a961fa48c6540a99ad64a6

The _DMA object contains a resource template, this change
adds support for the walk resources function so that ACPI
devices containing a _DMA object can actually parse it to
detect DMA ranges for the respective bus.
