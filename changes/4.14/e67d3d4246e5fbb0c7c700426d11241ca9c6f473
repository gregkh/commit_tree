xfs: add log recovery tracepoint for head/tail

Torn write detection and tail overwrite detection can shift the log
head and tail respectively in the event of CRC mismatch or
corruption errors. Add a high-level log recovery tracepoint to dump
the final log head/tail and make those values easily attainable in
debug/diagnostic situations.
