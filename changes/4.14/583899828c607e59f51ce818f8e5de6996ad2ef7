media: rc: mtk-cir: add support for MediaTek MT7622 SoC

This patch adds driver for CIR controller on MT7622 SoC. It has similar
handling logic as the previously MT7623 does, but there are some
differences in the register and field definition. So for ease portability
and maintenance, those differences all are being kept inside the platform
data as other drivers usually do. Currently testing successfully on NEC
and SONY remote controller.
