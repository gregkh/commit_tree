net: switchdev: Remove bridge bypass support from switchdev

Currently the bridge port flags, vlans, FDBs and MDBs can be offloaded
through the bridge code, making the switchdev's SELF bridge bypass
implementation to be redundant. This implies several changes:
- No need for dump infra in switchdev, DSA's special case is handled
  privately.
- Remove obj_dump from switchdev_ops.
- FDBs are removed from obj_add/del routines, due to the fact that they
  are offloaded through the bridge notification chain.
- The switchdev_port_bridge_xx() and switchdev_port_fdb_xx() functions
  can be removed.
