iio: ad7793: Fix the serial interface reset

The serial interface can be reset by writing 32 consecutive 1s to the device.
'ret' was initialized correctly but its value was overwritten when
ad7793_check_platform_data() was called. Since a dedicated reset function
is present now, it should be used instead.
