ACPI / processor: make function acpi_processor_check_duplicates() static

The function acpi_processor_check_duplicates() is local to the source
and does not need to be in global scope, so make it static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'acpi_processor_check_duplicates' was not declared. Should it
be static?
