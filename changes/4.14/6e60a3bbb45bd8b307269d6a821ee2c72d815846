nbd: fix -ERESTARTSYS handling

Christoph made it so that if we return'ed BLK_STS_RESOURCE whenever we
got ERESTARTSYS from sending our packets we'd return BLK_STS_OK, which
means we'd never requeue and just hang.  We really need to return the
right value from the upper layer.

Fixes: fc17b6534eb8 ("blk-mq: switch ->queue_rq return value to blk_status_t")
