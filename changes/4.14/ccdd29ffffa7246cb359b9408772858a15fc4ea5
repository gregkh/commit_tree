rcu: Create reasonable API for do_exit() TASKS_RCU processing

Currently, the exit-time support for TASKS_RCU is open-coded in do_exit().
This commit creates exit_tasks_rcu_start() and exit_tasks_rcu_finish()
APIs for do_exit() use.  This has the benefit of confining the use of the
tasks_rcu_exit_srcu variable to one file, allowing it to become static.
