net: rtnetlink: fix info leak in RTM_GETSTATS call

When RTM_GETSTATS was added the fields of its header struct were not all
initialized when returning the result thus leaking 4 bytes of information
to user-space per rtnl_fill_statsinfo call, so initialize them now. Thanks
to Alexander Potapenko for the detailed report and bisection.
