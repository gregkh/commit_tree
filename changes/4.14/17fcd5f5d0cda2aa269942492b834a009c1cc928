media: ov13858: Limit vblank to permissible range

Previously, vblank range given to user was too big, falling outside
of permissible range for a given resolution. Sometimes, too low vblank
resulted in errors.

Now, limit vblank to only permissible range for a given resolution.
This change limits lower-bounds of vblank, doesn't affect upper bounds.
