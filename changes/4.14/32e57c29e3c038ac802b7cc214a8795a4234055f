include/linux/fs.h: fix comment about struct address_space

Before commit 9c5d760b8d22 ("mm: split gfp_mask and mapping flags into
separate fields") the private_* fields of struct adrress_space were
grouped together and using "ditto" in comments describing the last
fields was correct.

With introduction of gpf_mask between private_lock and private_list
"ditto" references the wrong description.

Fix it by using the elaborate description.
