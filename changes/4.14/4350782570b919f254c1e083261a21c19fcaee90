serial: sprd: clear timeout interrupt only rather than all interrupts

On Spreadtrum's serial device, nearly all of interrupts would be cleared
by hardware except timeout interrupt.  This patch removed the operation
of clearing all interrupt in irq handler, instead added an if statement
to check if the timeout interrupt is supposed to be cleared.

Wrongly clearing timeout interrupt would lead to uart data stay in rx
fifo, that means the driver cannot read them out anymore.
