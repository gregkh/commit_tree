mtd: mtdswap: remove unused variables 'dev' and 'gd'

This was changed recently (commit e8e3edb95ce6 ("mtd: create per-device
and module-scope debugfs entries")) and some compilers are complaining:

   drivers//mtd/mtdswap.c: In function 'mtdswap_add_debugfs':
>> drivers//mtd/mtdswap.c:1317: warning: unused variable 'dev'

And once we kill 'dev', 'gd' is also unused.
