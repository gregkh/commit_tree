watchdog: renesas_wdt: apply better precision

The error margin of the clks_per_second variable was too large and
caused offsets when used with clock frequencies which left a remainder
after applying the dividers. Now we always calculate directly using the
clock rate and the divider using some helper macros. That also means
that DIV_ROUND_UP moves from probe to the multiplication macro. In
probe, we don't need to ensure anymore that 'clks_per_sec' would go too
fast but rather ensure that the lower limit is really at least 1 to
certainly get a full cycle.
