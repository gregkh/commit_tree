staging: ccree: move FIPS support to kernel infrastructure

The ccree driver had its own FIPS support, complete with
a test harness comparable to crypto testmgr and an
implementation which disables crypto functionality on
FIPS test error detection, either in Linux or from TEE.

This patch removes the duplication, while reimplementing
the handling of TEE reported FIPS errors according to the
kernel policy of inducing a panic in such an event.
