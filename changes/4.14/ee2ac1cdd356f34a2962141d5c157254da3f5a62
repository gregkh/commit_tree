iio: adc: stm32: add optional st,min-sample-time-nsecs

STM32 ADC allows each channel to be sampled with a different sampling time,
by setting SMPR registers. Basically, value depends on local electrical
properties. Selecting correct value for sampling time highly depends on
analog source impedance. There is a manual that may help in this process:
'How to get the best ADC accuracy in STM32...'

This patch allows to configure minimum sampling time via device tree,
either for:
- all channels at once:
  st,min-sample-time-nsecs = <10000>;

- independently for each channel (must match "st,adc-channels" list):
  st,adc-channels = <0 1>;
  st,min-sample-time-nsecs = <5000 10000>;
