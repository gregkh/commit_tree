drm/gma500: fix potential NULL pointer dereference dereference

NULL check at line 528: if (!sender || !data_out || !len_out) {, implies
that pointer _sender_ might be NULL.

Move pointer _sender_ dereference after NULL check in order to avoid a
potential NULL pointer dereference.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
