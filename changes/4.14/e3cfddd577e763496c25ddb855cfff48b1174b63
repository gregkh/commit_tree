bridge: add tracepoint in br_fdb_update

This extends bridge fdb table tracepoints to also cover
learned fdb entries in the br_fdb_update path. Note that
unlike other tracepoints I have moved this to when the fdb
is modified because this is in the datapath and can generate
a lot of noise in the trace output. br_fdb_update is also called
from added_by_user context in the NTF_USE case which is already
traced ..hence the !added_by_user check.
