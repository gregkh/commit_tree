ARC: [plat-eznps] handle extra aux regs #2: kernel/entry exit

Preserve eflags and gpa1 aux during entry/exit into kernel as these
could be modified by kernel mode

These registers used by compare exchange instructions.
  - GPA1 is used for compare value,
  - EFLAGS got bit reflects atomic operation response.

EFLAGS is zeroed for each new user task so it won't get its
parent value.
