ARM64: dts: marvell: armada-37xx: Fix GIC maintenance interrupt

The GIC-500 integrated in the Armada-37xx SoCs is compliant with
the GICv3 architecture, and thus provides a maintenance interrupt
that is required for hypervisors to function correctly.

With the interrupt provided in the DT, KVM now works as it should.
Tested on an Espressobin system.

a development board")
