net: hns3: Fix for setting rss_size incorrectly

rss_size is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, but acutal tc queue
size can be any u16 less than 128. If tc queue size is 5, we
set the rss_size to 8, indirection table will be used to limit
the size of actual queue size.
It may cause dropping of receiving packet in hardware if
rss_size is not set correctly.
For now, each TC has the same rss size.
