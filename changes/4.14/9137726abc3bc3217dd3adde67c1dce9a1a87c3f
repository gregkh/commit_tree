drm/i915/gen9+: Remove redundant state check during power well toggling

Atm we enable/disable a power well only if it wasn't already
enabled/disabled respectively. The only reason for this I can think of
is to save the extra MMIO writes. Since the HW state matches the power
well's usage counter most of the time the overhead due to these MMIOs is
insignificant. Let's simplify the code by making the writes
unconditional.
