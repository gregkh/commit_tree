sfp: add SFP module support

Add support for SFP hotpluggable modules via sfp-bus and phylink.
This supports both copper and optical SFP modules, which require
different Serdes modes in order to properly negotiate the link.

Optical SFP modules typically require the Serdes link to be talking
1000BaseX mode - this is the gigabit ethernet mode defined by the
802.3 standard.

Copper SFP modules typically integrate a PHY in the module to convert
from Serdes to copper, and the PHY will be configured by the vendor
to either present a 1000BaseX Serdes link (for fixed 1000BaseT) or a
SGMII Serdes link.  However, this is vendor defined, so we instead
detect the PHY, switch the link to SGMII mode, and use traditional
PHY based negotiation.
