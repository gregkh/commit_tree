iio: adc: mcp320x: Fix readout of negative voltages

Commit f686a36b4b79 ("iio: adc: mcp320x: Add support for mcp3301")
returns a signed voltage from mcp320x_adc_conversion() but neglects that
the caller interprets a negative return value as failure.  Only mcp3301
(and the upcoming mcp3550/1/3) is affected as the other chips are
incapable of measuring negative voltages.

Fix and while at it, add mcp3301 to the list of supported chips at the
top of the file.
