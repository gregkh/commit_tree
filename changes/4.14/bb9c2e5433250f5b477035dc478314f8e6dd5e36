xfs: move more RT specific code under CONFIG_XFS_RT

Various utility functions and interfaces that iterate internal
devices try to reference the realtime device even when RT support is
not compiled into the kernel.

Make sure this code is excluded from the CONFIG_XFS_RT=n build,
and where appropriate stub functions to return fatal errors if
they ever get called when RT support is not present.
