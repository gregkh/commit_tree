mm/memory_hotplug: define find_{smallest|biggest}_section_pfn as unsigned long

find_{smallest|biggest}_section_pfn()s find the smallest/biggest section
and return the pfn of the section.  But the functions are defined as int.
So the functions always return 0x00000000 - 0xffffffff.  It means if
memory address is over 16TB, the functions does not work correctly.

To handle 64 bit value, the patch defines
find_{smallest|biggest}_section_pfn() as unsigned long.
