video/console: Add dmi quirk table for x86 systems which need fbcon rotation

Some x86 clamshell design devices use portrait tablet screens and a
display engine which cannot rotate in hardware, so we need to rotate
the fbcon to compensate.

This commit adds a DMI based quirk table which is initially populated with
4 such devices: The Asus T100HA, GPD Pocket, the GPD win and the I.T.Works
TW891, so that the console comes up in the right orientation on these
devices OOTB.

Unfortunately these (cheap) devices also typically have quite generic DMI
data, so we match on a combination of DMI data, screen resolution and a
list of known BIOS dates to avoid false positives.
