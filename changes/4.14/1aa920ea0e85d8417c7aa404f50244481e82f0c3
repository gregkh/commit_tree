drm/i915: add register macro definition style guide

This is not to try to force a new style; this is my interpretation of
what the most common existing style is.

With hopes I don't need to answer so many questions about style going
forward.

Start a new style section in the i915 document to bolt the register
style guide into.

v2: vertical alignment, incorporate to kernel-doc, and more
