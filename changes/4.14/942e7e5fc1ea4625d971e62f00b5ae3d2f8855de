net/mlx4_core: fix incorrect size allocation for dev->caps.spec_qps

The current allocation for dev->caps.spec_qps is for the size of the
pointer and not the size of the actual  mlx4_spec_qps structure.  Fix
this by using the correct size.   Also splint allocation over a few
lines to make it cppcheck clean on overly wide lines.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1455222 ("Wrong sizeof argument")
