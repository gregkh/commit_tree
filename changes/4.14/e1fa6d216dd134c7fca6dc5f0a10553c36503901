rtnetlink: call rtnl_calcit directly

There is only a single place in the kernel that regisers the "calcit"
callback (to determine min allocation for dumps).

This is in rtnetlink.c for PF_UNSPEC RTM_GETLINK.
The function that checks for calcit presence at run time will first check
the requested family (which will always fail for !PF_UNSPEC as no callsite
registers this), then falls back to checking PF_UNSPEC.

Therefore we can just check if type is RTM_GETLINK and then do a direct
call.  Because of fallback to PF_UNSPEC all RTM_GETLINK types used this
regardless of family.

This has the advantage that we don't need to allocate space for
the function pointer for all the other families.

A followup patch will drop the calcit function pointer from the
rtnl_link callback structure.
