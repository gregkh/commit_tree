devlink: Add support for dynamic table size

Up until now the dpipe table's size was static and known at registration
time. The host table does not have constant size and it is resized in
dynamic manner. In order to support this behavior the size is changed
to be obtained dynamically via an op.

This patch also adjust the current dpipe table for the new API.
