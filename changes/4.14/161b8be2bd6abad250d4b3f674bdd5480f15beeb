nvme-pci: initialize queue memory before interrupts

A spurious interrupt before the nvme driver has initialized the completion
queue may inadvertently cause the driver to believe it has a completion
to process. This may result in a NULL dereference since the nvmeq's tags
are not set at this point.

The patch initializes the host's CQ memory so that a spurious interrupt
isn't mistaken for a real completion.
