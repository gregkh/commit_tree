perf/core: Avoid freeing static PMU contexts when PMU is unregistered

Since commit:

  1fd7e4169954 ("perf/core: Remove perf_cpu_context::unique_pmu")

... when a PMU is unregistered then its associated ->pmu_cpu_context is
unconditionally freed. Whilst this is fine for dynamically allocated
context types (i.e. those registered using perf_invalid_context), this
causes a problem for sharing of static contexts such as
perf_{sw,hw}_context, which are used by multiple built-in PMUs and
effectively have a global lifetime.

Whilst testing the ARM SPE driver, which must use perf_sw_context to
support per-task AUX tracing, unregistering the driver as a result of a
module unload resulted in:

 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000038
 Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
 Modules linked in: [last unloaded: arm_spe_pmu]

 do_execveat_common.isra.14+0x540/0x618
 SyS_execve+0x38/0x48

since the software context has been freed and the ctx.pmu->pmu_disable_count
field has been set to NULL.

This patch fixes the problem by avoiding the freeing of static PMU contexts
altogether. Whilst the sharing of dynamic contexts is questionable, this
actually requires the caller to share their context pointer explicitly
and so the burden is on them to manage the object lifetime.
