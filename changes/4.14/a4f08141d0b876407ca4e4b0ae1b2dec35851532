drivers/ata: Replace spin_unlock_wait() with lock/unlock pair

There is no agreed-upon definition of spin_unlock_wait()'s semantics,
and it appears that all callers could do just as well with a lock/unlock
pair.  This commit therefore eliminates the spin_unlock_wait() call and
associated else-clause and hoists the then-clause's lock and unlock out of
the "if" statement.  This should be safe from a performance perspective
because according to Tejun there should be few if any drivers that don't
set their own error handler.
