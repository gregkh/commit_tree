quota: Do more fine-grained locking in dquot_acquire()

We need dqio_sem held just for reading when calling ->read_dqblk() in
dquot_acquire(). Also dqio_sem is not needed when setting DQ_READ_B and
DQ_ACTIVE_B as concurrent reads and dquot activations are serialized by
dq_lock. So acquire and release dqio_sem closer to the place where it is
needed. This reduces lock hold time and will make locking changes
easier.
