ARM: shmobile: rcar-gen2: Obtain jump stub region from DT

Add support for obtaining from DT the SRAM region to store the jump stub
for CPU core bringup, according to the renesas,smp-sram DT bindings.

If no region is specified in DT, the code falls back to hardcoded ICRAM1
as before, to maintain backwards compatibility.
