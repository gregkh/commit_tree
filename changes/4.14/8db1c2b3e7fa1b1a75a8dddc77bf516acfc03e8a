scsi: lpfc: Fix handling of FCP and NVME FC4 types in Pt2Pt topology

After link bounce in a NVME Pt2Pt config, the driver managed to map the
same nport twice, resulting in multiple device nodes for the same
namespace.

In Pt2Pt, the driver must send PRLI's for both (scsi) FCP and NVME
rather than using fabric aids. The driver was inconsistent on handling
various PRLI completions, especially rejects, which had reject codes
cross the different protocol PRLI completions.

Fixed to perform the following: if nvmet mode (fc port can only be a
nvme target) - rejects all unsolicitly FCP PRLI's. Never issues a FCP
PRLI.

The multiple protocol PRLI's are sent simultaneously. However, driver
will now only state transition after both PRLI's are complete. New flags
were added to aid tracking the responses from the different PRLI's.
