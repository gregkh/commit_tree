RDMA/core: make ib_device.add method optional

ib_clients can indeed fill .add to NULL, but then they will not see
any device removal notifications. The reason is that that
ib_register_client and ib_register_device checked existence of .add
before adding the creating a corresponding client_data and adding
it to the list. Simple condition reverse fixes the issue.
