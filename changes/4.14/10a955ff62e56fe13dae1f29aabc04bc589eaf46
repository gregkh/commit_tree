i40e: Detect ATR HW Evict NVM issue and disable the feature

This patch fixes a problem with the HW ATR eviction feature where the
NVM setting was incorrect.  This patch detects the issue on X720
adapters and disables the feature if the NVM setting is incorrect.

Without this patch, HW ATR Evict feature does not work on broken NVMs
and is not detected either.  If the HW ATR Evict feature is disabled
the SW Eviction feature will take effect.
