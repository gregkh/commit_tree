powerpc/mm: Rename find_linux_pte_or_hugepte()

Add newer helpers to make the function usage simpler. It is always
recommended to use find_current_mm_pte() for walking the page table.
If we cannot use find_current_mm_pte(), it should be documented why
the said usage of __find_linux_pte() is safe against a parallel THP
split.

For now we have KVM code using __find_linux_pte(). This is because kvm
code ends up calling __find_linux_pte() in real mode with MSR_EE=0 but
with PACA soft_enabled = 1. We may want to fix that later and make
sure we keep the MSR_EE and PACA soft_enabled in sync. When we do that
we can switch kvm to use find_linux_pte().
