powerpc/sstep: Avoid used uninitialized error

Older compilers think val may be used uninitialized:

  arch/powerpc/lib/sstep.c: In function 'emulate_loadstore':
  arch/powerpc/lib/sstep.c:2758:23: error: 'val' may be used uninitialized in this function

We know better, but initialise val to 0 to avoid breaking the build.
