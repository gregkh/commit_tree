sctp: fix a type cast warnings that causes a_rwnd gets the wrong value

These warnings were found by running 'make C=2 M=net/sctp/'.

Commit d4d6fb5787a6 ("sctp: Try not to change a_rwnd when faking a
SACK from SHUTDOWN.") expected to use the peers old rwnd and add
our flight size to the a_rwnd. But with the wrong Endian, it may
not work as well as expected.

So fix it by converting to the right value.
