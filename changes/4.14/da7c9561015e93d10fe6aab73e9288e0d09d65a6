packet: only test po->has_vnet_hdr once in packet_snd

Packet socket option po->has_vnet_hdr can be updated concurrently with
other operations if no ring is attached.

Do not test the option twice in packet_snd, as the value may change in
between calls. A race on setsockopt disable may cause a packet > mtu
to be sent without having GSO options set.
