net: xdp: support xdp generic on virtual devices

XDP generic allows users to test XDP programs and/or run them with
degraded performance on devices that do not yet support XDP. For
testing I typically test eBPF programs using a set of veth devices.
This allows testing topologies that would otherwise be difficult to
setup especially in the early stages of development.

This patch adds a xdp generic hook to the netif_rx_internal()
function which is called from dev_forward_skb(). With this addition
attaching XDP programs to veth devices works as expected! Also I
noticed multiple drivers using netif_rx(). These devices will also
benefit and generic XDP will work for them as well.
