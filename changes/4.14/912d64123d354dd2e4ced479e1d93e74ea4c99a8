drm/i915/psr: Preserve SRD_CTL bit 29 on PSR init

Bit 29 of SRD_CTL needs to have its value preserved according to the
B-Spec, so right before we write out the register we go ahead and read
the register and preserve the value of that bit before we write out
the configured register value.

v2: Spaces => tabs, minor name change, and commit message wording (Rodrigo)
