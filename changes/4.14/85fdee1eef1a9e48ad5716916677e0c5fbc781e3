ovl: fix regression caused by exclusive upper/work dir protection

Enforcing exclusive ownership on upper/work dirs caused a docker
regression: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34672.

Euan spotted the regression and pointed to the offending commit.
Vivek has brought the regression to my attention and provided this
reproducer:

Terminal 1:

  mount -t overlay -o workdir=work,lowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper none
        merged/

Terminal 2:

  unshare -m

Terminal 1:

  umount merged
  mount -t overlay -o workdir=work,lowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper none
        merged/
  mount: /root/overlay-testing/merged: none already mounted or mount point
         busy

To fix the regression, I replaced the error with an alarming warning.
With index feature enabled, mount does fail, but logs a suggestion to
override exclusive dir protection by disabling index.
Note that index=off mount does take the inuse locks, so a concurrent
index=off will issue the warning and a concurrent index=on mount will fail.

Documentation was updated to reflect this change.
