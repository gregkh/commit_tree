scsi: lpfc: Fix relative offset error on large nvmet target ios

If the nvmet_fc transport breaks an io into multiple sequences, the
driver will improperly set the relative offset on the 2nd through N
sequences.

Correct by properly formatting the hw cmd so the relative offset is
picked up from the hw cmd.
