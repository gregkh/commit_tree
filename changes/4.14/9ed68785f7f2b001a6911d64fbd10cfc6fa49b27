ARC: mm: Decouple RAM base address from kernel link address

	[Needed for HSDK]

Currently the first page of system (hence RAM base) is assumed to be
@ CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE, where kernel itself is linked.

However is case of HSDK platform, for reasons explained in that patch,
this is not true. kernel needs to be linked @ 0x9000_0000 while DDR
is still wired at 0x8000_0000. To properly account for this 256M of RAM,
we need to introduce a new option and base page frame accountiing off of
it.
