KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't access XIVE PIPR register using byte accesses

The XIVE interrupt controller on POWER9 machines doesn't support byte
accesses to any register in the thread management area other than the
CPPR (current processor priority register).  In particular, when
reading the PIPR (pending interrupt priority register), we need to
do a 32-bit or 64-bit load.
