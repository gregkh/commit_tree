drm/i915: Implement .get_format_info() hook for CCS

SKL+ display engine can scan out certain kinds of compressed surfaces
produced by the render engine. This involved telling the display engine
the location of the color control surfae (CCS) which describes which
parts of the main surface are compressed and which are not. The location
of CCS is provided by userspace as just another plane with its own offset.

By providing our own format information for the CCS formats, we should
be able to make framebuffer_check() do the right thing for the CCS
surface as well.

Note that we'll return the same format info for both Y and Yf tiled
format as that's what happens with the non-CCS Y vs. Yf as well. If
desired, we could potentially return a unique pointer for each
pixel_format+tiling+ccs combination, in which case we immediately be
able to tell if any of that stuff changed by just comparing the
pointers. But that does sound a bit wasteful space wise.

v2: Drop the 'dev' argument from the hook
v3: Include the description of the CCS surface layout
v4: Pretend CCS tiles are regular 128 byte wide Y tiles (Jason)
v5: Re-drop 'dev', fix commit message, add missing drm_fourcc.h
    description of CCS layout. (daniels)
