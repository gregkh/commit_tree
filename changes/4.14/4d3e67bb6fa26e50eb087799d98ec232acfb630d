drm/i915/gvt: Refine the intel_vgpu_reset_gtt reset function

When doing the VGPU reset, we don't need to do the gtt/ppgtt reset.
This will make the GVT to do the ppgtt shadow every time for
a workload and caused really bad performance after a VGPU reset.
This patch will make sure ppgtt clean only happen at device module
level reset to fix this.
