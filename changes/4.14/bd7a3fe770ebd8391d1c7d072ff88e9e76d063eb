USB: fix out-of-bounds in usb_set_configuration

Andrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for a USB interface
association descriptor.  He writes:
	It seems there's no proper size check of a USB_DT_INTERFACE_ASSOCIATION
	descriptor. It's only checked that the size is >= 2 in
	usb_parse_configuration(), so find_iad() might do out-of-bounds access
	to intf_assoc->bInterfaceCount.

And he's right, we don't check for crazy descriptors of this type very well, so
resolve this problem.  Yet another issue found by syzkaller...
