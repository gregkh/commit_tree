Btrfs: add skeleton code for compression heuristic

Add skeleton code for compresison heuristics. Now it iterates over all
the pages, but in the end always says "yes, compress please", ie it does
not change the current behaviour.

In the future we're going to add various heuristics to analyze the data.
This patch can be used as a baseline for measuring if the effectivness
and performance.
