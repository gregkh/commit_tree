MIPS: PCI: Move map_irq() hooks out of initdata

04c81c7293df ("MIPS: PCI: Replace pci_fixup_irqs() call with host bridge
IRQ mapping hooks") moved the PCI IRQ fixup to the new host bridge
map/swizzle_irq() hooks mechanism. Those hooks can also be called after
boot, when all the __init/__initdata/__initconst sections have been freed.
Therefore, functions called by them (and the data they refer to) must not
be marked as __init/__initdata/__initconst lest compilation trigger section
mismatch warnings.

Fix all the board files map_irq() hooks by simply removing the respective
__init/__initdata/__initconst section markers and by adding another
persistent hook IRQ map for the txx9 board files.
