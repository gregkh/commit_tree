perf buildid-cache: Cache debuginfo

If a stripped binary is placed in the cache, the user is in a situation
where there's a cached elf file present, but it doesn't have any symtab
to use for name resolution.  Grab the debuginfo for binaries that don't
end in .ko.  This yields a better chance of resolving symbols from older
traces.
