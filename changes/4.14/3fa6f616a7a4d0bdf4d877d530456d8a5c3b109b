net: ipv4: add second dif to inet socket lookups

Add a second device index, sdif, to inet socket lookups. sdif is the
index for ingress devices enslaved to an l3mdev. It allows the lookups
to consider the enslaved device as well as the L3 domain when searching
for a socket.

TCP moves the data in the cb. Prior to tcp_v4_rcv (e.g., early demux) the
ingress index is obtained from IPCB using inet_sdif and after the cb move
in  tcp_v4_rcv the tcp_v4_sdif helper is used.
