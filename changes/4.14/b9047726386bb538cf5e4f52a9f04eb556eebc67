ipc: mqueue: Replace timespec with timespec64

struct timespec is not y2038 safe. Replace
all uses of timespec by y2038 safe struct timespec64.

Even though timespec is used here to represent timeouts,
replace these with timespec64 so that it facilitates
in verification by creating a y2038 safe kernel image
that is free of timespec.

The syscall interfaces themselves are not changed as part
of the patch. They will be part of a different series.
