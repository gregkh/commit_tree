MIPS: CPS: Detect CPUs in secondary clusters

As a first step towards supporting multi-cluster systems, detect cores &
VPs in secondary clusters & record their cluster information in the
cpu_data array. The "VP topology" line printed during boot is extended
to display multiple clusters. On a single cluster it shows output like
the following:

  VP topology: {4,4}

This would indicate a system with 2 cores which each contain 4 VPs. We
extend this to cover multiple clusters in a natural way:

  VP topology: {4,4},{2,2}

This would indicate a system with 2 clusters. The first cluster contains
2 cores which each contain 4 VPs. The second cluster contains 2 cores
which each contain 2 VPs.

Actually booting these cores & VPs is left to further patches once other
pieces are in place.
