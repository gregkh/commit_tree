drm: rename, adjust and export drm_atomic_replace_property_blob

The function has little to do with atomic, it's just where it has so
far been needed. So, rename it to drm_property_replace_blob, move it
to drm_property.c and export it.

Change the semantics to return whether the blob was replaced instead
of using an extra argument for that.
