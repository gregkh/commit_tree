powerpc/pci: Remove OF node back pointer from pci_dn

The check_req() helper uses pci_get_pdn() to get an OF node pointer.
pci_get_pdn() returns a pci_dn pointer which either:
1) from the OF node returned by pci_device_to_OF_node();
2) from the parent child_list where entries don't have OF node pointers.
Since check_req() does not care about 2), it can call
pci_device_to_OF_node() directly, hence the change.

The find_pe_dn() helper uses embedded pci_dn to get an OF node which is
also stored in edev->pdev so let's take a shortcut and call
pci_device_to_OF_node() directly.

With these 2 changes, we can finally get rid of the OF node back pointer.
