irqchip: mips-gic: Move various definitions to the driver

Move the definitions of macros used to convert between hardware IRQ
numbers & shared or local interrupt numbers into the irqchip driver,
which is all that should ever need to care about them.

Remove GIC_CPU_TO_VEC_OFFSET() in the process since it's never used.
