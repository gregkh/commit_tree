drm/i915: Simplify eb_lookup_vmas()

Since the introduction of being able to perform a lockless lookup of an
object (i915_gem_object_get_rcu() in fbbd37b36fa5 ("drm/i915: Move object
release to a freelist + worker") we no longer need to split the
object/vma lookup into 3 phases and so combine them into a much simpler
single loop.
