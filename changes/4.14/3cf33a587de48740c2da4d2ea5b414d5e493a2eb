xen/pvcalls: implement poll command

Implement poll on passive sockets by requesting a delayed response with
mappass->reqcopy, and reply back when there is data on the passive
socket.

Poll on active socket is unimplemented as by the spec, as the frontend
should just wait for events and check the indexes on the indexes page.

Only support one outstanding poll (or accept) request for every passive
socket at any given time.
