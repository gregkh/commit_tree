dt-bindings: Remove "status" from examples

Pretty much any node can have a status property, so it doesn't need to
be in examples.

Converted with the following command and removed examples with SoC and
board specific splits:

git grep -l -E 'status.*=.*' Documentation/devicetree/ | xargs sed -i -E '/\sstatus.*=.*"(disabled|ok|okay)/d'
