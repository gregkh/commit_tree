mm, swap: use page-cluster as max window of VMA based swap readahead

When the VMA based swap readahead was introduced, a new knob

  /sys/kernel/mm/swap/vma_ra_max_order

was added as the max window of VMA swap readahead.  This is to make it
possible to use different max window for VMA based readahead and
original physical readahead.  But Minchan Kim pointed out that this will
cause a regression because setting page-cluster sysctl to zero cannot
disable swap readahead with the change.

To fix the regression, the page-cluster sysctl is used as the max window
of both the VMA based swap readahead and original physical swap
readahead.  If more fine grained control is needed in the future, more
knobs can be added as the subordinate knobs of the page-cluster sysctl.

The vma_ra_max_order knob is deleted.  Because the knob was introduced
in v4.14-rc1, and this patch is targeting being merged before v4.14
releasing, there should be no existing users of this newly added ABI.
