firmware: Restore support for built-in firmware

Commit 5620a0d1aac ("firmware: delete in-kernel firmware") removed the
entire firmware directory.  Unfortunately it thereby also removed the
support for built-in firmware.

This restores the ability to build firmware directly into the kernel by
pruning the original Makefile to the necessary minimum.  The default for
EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR is now the standard directory /lib/firmware/.
