perf symbols: Fix memory corruption because of zero length symbols

Perf top is often crashing at very random locations on powerpc.  After
investigating, I found the crash only happens when sample is of zero
length symbol. Powerpc kernel has many such symbols which does not
contain length details in vmlinux binary and thus start and end
addresses of such symbols are same.

Structure

  struct sym_hist {
        u64                   nr_samples;
        u64                   period;
        struct sym_hist_entry addr[0];
  };

has last member 'addr[]' of size zero. 'addr[]' is an array of addresses
that belongs to one symbol (function). If function consist of 100
instructions, 'addr' points to an array of 100 'struct sym_hist_entry'
elements. For zero length symbol, it points to the *empty* array, i.e.
no members in the array and thus offset 0 is also invalid for such
array.

  static int __symbol__inc_addr_samples(...)
  {
        ...
        offset = addr - sym->start;
        h = annotation__histogram(notes, evidx);
        h->nr_samples++;
        h->addr[offset].nr_samples++;
        h->period += sample->period;
        h->addr[offset].period += sample->period;
        ...
  }

Here, when 'addr' is same as 'sym->start', 'offset' becomes 0, which is
valid for normal symbols but *invalid* for zero length symbols and thus
updating h->addr[offset] causes memory corruption.

Fix this by adding one dummy element for zero length symbols.
