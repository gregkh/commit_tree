IB/mlx5: Add raw ethernet local loopback support

Currently, unicast/multicast loopback raw ethernet
(non-RDMA) packets are sent back to the vport.
A unicast loopback packet is the packet with destination
MAC address the same as the source MAC address.
For multicast, the destination MAC address is in the
vport's multicast filter list.

Moreover, the local loopback is not needed if
there is one or none user space context.

After this patch, the raw ethernet unicast and multicast
local loopback are disabled by default. When there is more
than one user space context, the local loopback is enabled.

Note that when local loopback is disabled, raw ethernet
packets are not looped back to the vport and are forwarded
to the next routing level (eswitch, or multihost switch,
or out to the wire depending on the configuration).
