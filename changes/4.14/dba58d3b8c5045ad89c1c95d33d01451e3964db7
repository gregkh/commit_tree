mm/mremap: fail map duplication attempts for private mappings

mremap will attempt to create a 'duplicate' mapping if old_size == 0 is
specified.  In the case of private mappings, mremap will actually create
a fresh separate private mapping unrelated to the original.  This does
not fit with the design semantics of mremap as the intention is to
create a new mapping based on the original.

Therefore, return EINVAL in the case where an attempt is made to
duplicate a private mapping.  Also, print a warning message (once) if
such an attempt is made.
