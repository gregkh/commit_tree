cpuset: Make nr_cpusets private

Any use of key->enabled (that is static_key_enabled and static_key_count)
outside jump_label_lock should handle its own serialization.  In the case
of cpusets_enabled_key, the key is always incremented/decremented under
cpuset_mutex, and hence the same rule applies to nr_cpusets.  The rule
*is* respected currently, but the mutex is static so nr_cpusets should
be static too.
