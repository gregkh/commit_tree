perf/core, x86: Add PERF_SAMPLE_PHYS_ADDR

For understanding how the workload maps to memory channels and hardware
behavior, it's very important to collect address maps with physical
addresses. For example, 3D XPoint access can only be found by filtering
the physical address.

Add a new sample type for physical address.

perf already has a facility to collect data virtual address. This patch
introduces a function to convert the virtual address to physical address.
The function is quite generic and can be extended to any architecture as
long as a virtual address is provided.

 - For kernel direct mapping addresses, virt_to_phys is used to convert
   the virtual addresses to physical address.

 - For user virtual addresses, __get_user_pages_fast is used to walk the
   pages tables for user physical address.

 - This does not work for vmalloc addresses right now. These are not
   resolved, but code to do that could be added.

The new sample type requires collecting the virtual address. The
virtual address will not be output unless SAMPLE_ADDR is applied.

For security, the physical address can only be exposed to root or
privileged user.
