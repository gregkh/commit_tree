s390/cpcmd,vmcp: avoid GFP_DMA allocations

According to the CP Programming Services manual Diagnose Code 8
"Virtual Console Function" can be used in all addressing modes. Also
the input and output buffers do not have a limitation which specifies
they need to be below the 2GB line.

This is true at least since z/VM 5.4.

Therefore remove the sam31/64 instructions and allow for simple
GFP_KERNEL allocations. This makes it easier to allocate a 1MB page
if the user requested such a large return buffer.
