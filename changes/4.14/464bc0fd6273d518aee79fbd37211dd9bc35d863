bpf: convert sockmap field attach_bpf_fd2 to type

In the initial sockmap API we provided strparser and verdict programs
using a single attach command by extending the attach API with a the
attach_bpf_fd2 field.

However, if we add other programs in the future we will be adding a
field for every new possible type, attach_bpf_fd(3,4,..). This
seems a bit clumsy for an API. So lets push the programs using two
new type fields.

   BPF_SK_SKB_STREAM_PARSER
   BPF_SK_SKB_STREAM_VERDICT

This has the advantage of having a readable name and can easily be
extended in the future.

Updates to samples and sockmap included here also generalize tests
slightly to support upcoming patch for multiple map support.
