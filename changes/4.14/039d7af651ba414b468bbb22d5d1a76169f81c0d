EDAC, sb_edac: Classify memory mirroring modes

Basically, there are full memory mirroring and address range partial
memory mirroring (supported by Haswell EX and Broadwell EX) modes.

a) In full memory mirroring, the memory behind each memory controller
   is mirrored, i.e. the memory is split into two identical mirrors
   (primary and secondary), half of the memory is reserved for redundancy.

b) In address range partial memory mirroring, the memory size (range)
   of primary and secondary behind each memory controller can be user
   defined by the TAD0 register. The rest of memory ranges defined by
   TAD1/TAD2/... in that memory controller are non-mirrored.

For more detail on memory mirroring, see the following link written by Tony Luck:

  https://01.org/lkp/blogs/tonyluck/2016/address-range-partial-memory-mirroring-linux

Currently the sb_edac driver only supports address decoding in full
memory mirroring and non-mirroring modes. In address range partial
memory mirroring mode, it may fail to decode an address that falls in a
non-mirroring area (the following was one of this kind of failed logs).

Therefore, classify memory mirroring modes and make the address decoding
in address range partial memory mode correct.
