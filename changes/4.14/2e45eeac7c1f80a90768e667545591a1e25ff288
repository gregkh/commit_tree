drm: Only lastclose on unload for legacy drivers

The only thing modern drivers are supposed to do in lastclose is
restore the fb emulation state. Which is entirely optional, and
there's really no reason to do that. So restrict it to legacy drivers
(where the driver cleanup essentially happens in lastclose).

This will also allow us to share the unregister function with
drm_dev_unplug().

Quoting my reply to Alex on dri-devel:

So I think there's 3 cases:
- Trying to unload the module. You can't do that while anyone has the
fd still open, so lastclose is guaranteeed to run.
- Forcefully unbinding the driver through sysfs. Not any better, since
the can_switch stuff checks for the open count, and so will delay the
delayed switch no matter what.
- Actual hotremoval: a) not implemented since none of the drivers
taking part in vgaswitcheroo correctly unplug the drm device and b)
you can't hotremove a chip from a laptop.

v2: Extend commit message with m-l discussion.
