bpf/verifier: track signed and unsigned min/max values

Allows us to, sometimes, combine information from a signed check of one
 bound and an unsigned check of the other.
We now track the full range of possible values, rather than restricting
 ourselves to [0, 1<<30) and considering anything beyond that as
 unknown.  While this is probably not necessary, it makes the code more
 straightforward and symmetrical between signed and unsigned bounds.
