ACPICA: Tables: Add sanity check in acpi_put_table()

ACPICA commit 73512384c9eb1e7f1b28d0a7372df26a3732f96b

To avoid caller to trigger unexpected warning messages (Link #1):
  ACPI Warning: Table ffffffffbb461d20, Validation count is zero before decrement
Which is reported from acpi_tb_put_table(). When the table is validated, the
pointer must be non-zero. Thus the message is not suitable for invalidated
tables. This patch fixes the callee side based on this fact. Reported by
Cristian Aravena Romero, Fixed by Lv Zheng.
