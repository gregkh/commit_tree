ACPI / PM: Prefer suspend-to-idle over S3 on some systems

Modify the ACPI system sleep support setup code to select
suspend-to-idle as the default system sleep state if
(1) the ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0 flag is set in the FADT and
(2) the Low Power Idle S0 _DSM interface has been discovered and
(3) the default sleep state was not selected from the kernel command
line.

The main motivation for this change is that systems where the (1) and
(2) conditions are met typically ship with OSes that don't exercise
the S3 path in the platform firmware which remains untested and turns
out to be non-functional at least in some cases.
