tty: synclinkmp: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  44660	    432	    104	  45196	   b08c	drivers/tty/synclinkmp.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  44756	    336	    104	  45196	   b08c	drivers/tty/synclinkmp.o
