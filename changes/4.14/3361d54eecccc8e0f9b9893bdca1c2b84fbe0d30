media: solo6x10: fix detection of TW2864B chips

This patch enables support for non-Bluecherry labeled solo6110
based PCI cards which have 3 x TW2864B chips and one TW2865.
These cards are displayed by lspci -nn as

"Softlogic Co., Ltd. SOLO6110 H.264 Video encoder/decoder [9413:6110]"

Bluecherry cards have 4 x TW2864A. According to datasheet register 0xFF
of TW2864B chips contains value 0x6A or 0x6B depending on revision
which being shifted 3 bits right gives value 0x0d.
Existing version of solo6x10 fails on these cards with

[276582.344942] solo6x10 0000:07:00.0: Probing Softlogic 6110
[276582.402151] solo6x10 0000:07:00.0: Could not initialize any techwell chips
[276582.402781] solo6x10: probe of 0000:07:00.0 failed with error -22
