KVM: x86: Avoid guest page table walk when gpa_available is set

When a guest causes a page fault which requires emulation, the
vcpu->arch.gpa_available flag is set to indicate that cr2 contains a
valid GPA.

Currently, emulator_read_write_onepage() makes use of gpa_available flag
to avoid a guest page walk for a known MMIO regions. Lets not limit
the gpa_available optimization to just MMIO region. The patch extends
the check to avoid page walk whenever gpa_available flag is set.
