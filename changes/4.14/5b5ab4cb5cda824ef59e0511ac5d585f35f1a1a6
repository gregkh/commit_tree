staging: r8822be: Add Makefiles and Kconfig for new driver

The RTL8822BE, an 802.11ac wireless network card, is now appearing in
new computers. Its driver is being placed in staging to reduce the time
that users of this new card will have access to in-kernel drivers.

This commit enables building of the new driver. For this version, all
routines are built into a single module r8822be. When this driver is
moved to the wireless tree, halmac, phydm, and rtl8822be will become
new modules.
