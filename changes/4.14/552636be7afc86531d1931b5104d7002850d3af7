media: devnode: Rename mdev argument as devnode

Historically, mdev argument name was being used on both struct
media_device and struct media_devnode. Recently most occurrences of mdev
referring to struct media_devnode were replaced by devnode, which makes
more sense. Fix the last remaining occurrence.
