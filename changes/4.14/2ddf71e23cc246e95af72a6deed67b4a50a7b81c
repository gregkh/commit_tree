net: add notifier hooks for devmap bpf map

The BPF map devmap holds a refcnt on the net_device structure when
it is in the map. We need to do this to ensure on driver unload we
don't lose a dev reference.

However, its not very convenient to have to manually unload the map
when destroying a net device so add notifier handlers to do the cleanup
automatically. But this creates a race between update/destroy BPF
syscall and programs and the unregister netdev hook.

Unfortunately, the best I could come up with is either to live with
requiring manual removal of net devices from the map before removing
the net device OR to add a mutex in devmap to ensure the map is not
modified while we are removing a device. The fallout also requires
that BPF programs no longer update/delete the map from the BPF program
side because the mutex may sleep and this can not be done from inside
an rcu critical section.  This is not a real problem though because I
have not come up with any use cases where this is actually useful in
practice. If/when we come up with a compelling user for this we may
need to revisit this.
