ARM: dts: r8a7794: Use R-Car Gen 2 fallback binding for vin nodes

Use R-Car Gen 2 fallback binding for vind nodes in DT for r8a7794 SoC.

This has no run-time effect for the current driver as the initialisation
sequence is the same for the SoC-specific binding for r8a7794 and the
fallback binding for R-Car Gen 2
