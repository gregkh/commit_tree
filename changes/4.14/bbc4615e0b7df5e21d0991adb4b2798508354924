x86/intel_rdt/mbm: Fix MBM overflow handler during CPU hotplug

When a CPU is dying, the overflow worker is canceled and rescheduled on a
different CPU in the same domain. But if the timer is already about to
expire this essentially doubles the interval which might result in a non
detected overflow.

Cancel the overflow worker and reschedule it immediately on a different CPU
in same domain. The work could be flushed as well, but that would
reschedule it on the same CPU.
