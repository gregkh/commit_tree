ASoC: Intel: uapi: Add new tokens for module common data

The module private data can be modelled independent of its instances so
that it can be reused by the module instances. So move module data to
common manifest which can be referenced by the module instances.

This requires new tokens to be defined to accommodate these changes. The
new tokens will specify buffer sizes, DSP cycles and respective indexes
corresponding to the pcm params in the topology manifest so that driver
need not compute them.
