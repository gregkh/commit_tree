tcp: Revert "tcp: remove header prediction"

This reverts commit 45f119bf936b1f9f546a0b139c5b56f9bb2bdc78.

Eric Dumazet says:
  We found at Google a significant regression caused by
  45f119bf936b1f9f546a0b139c5b56f9bb2bdc78 tcp: remove header prediction

  In typical RPC  (TCP_RR), when a TCP socket receives data, we now call
  tcp_ack() while we used to not call it.

  This touches enough cache lines to cause a slowdown.

so problem does not seem to be HP removal itself but the tcp_ack()
call.  Therefore, it might be possible to remove HP after all, provided
one finds a way to elide tcp_ack for most cases.
