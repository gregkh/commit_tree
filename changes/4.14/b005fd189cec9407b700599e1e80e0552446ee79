bpf: introduce new program type for skbs on sockets

A class of programs, run from strparser and soon from a new map type
called sock map, are used with skb as the context but on established
sockets. By creating a specific program type for these we can use
bpf helpers that expect full sockets and get the verifier to ensure
these helpers are not used out of context.

The new type is BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_SKB. This patch introduces the
infrastructure and type.
