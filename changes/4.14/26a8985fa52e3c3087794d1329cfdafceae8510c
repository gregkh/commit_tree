nfp: remove the probe deferral when FW not present

We use a hack to defer probe when firmware was not pre-loaded
or found on disk.  This helps in case users forgot to include
firmware in initramfs, the driver will most likely get another
shot at probing after real root is mounted.

This is not for what EPROBE_DEFER is supposed to be used, and
when FW is completely missing every time new device is probed
NFP will reprobe spamming kernel logs.

Remove this hack, users will now have to make sure the right
firmware image is present in initramfs if nfp.ko is placed
there or built in.
