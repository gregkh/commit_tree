KVM: s390: Multiple Epoch Facility support

Allow for the enablement of MEF and the support for the extended
epoch in SIE and VSIE for the extended guest TOD-Clock.

A new interface is used for getting/setting a guest's extended TOD-Clock
that uses a single ioctl invocation, KVM_S390_VM_TOD_EXT.  Since the
host time is a moving target that might see an epoch switch or STP sync
checks we need an atomic ioctl and cannot use the exisiting two
interfaces. The old method of getting and setting the guest TOD-Clock is
still retained and is used when the old ioctls are called.
