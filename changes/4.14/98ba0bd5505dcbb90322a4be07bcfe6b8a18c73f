sock: allocate skbs from optmem

Add sock_omalloc and sock_ofree to be able to allocate control skbs,
for instance for looping errors onto sk_error_queue.

The transmit budget (sk_wmem_alloc) is involved in transmit skb
shaping, most notably in TCP Small Queues. Using this budget for
control packets would impact transmission.
