media: docs: fix PDF build with Sphinx 1.4

Commit 70b074df4ed1 ("media: fix pdf build with Spinx 1.6") caused
a regression at Sphinx 1.4 PDF build: although it produces a full
document in batch mode, it returns errors on interactive mode:

	[63]
	Runaway argument?
	{\relax
	! Paragraph ended before \multicolumn was complete.
	<to be read again>
	                   \par
	l.7703 \hline\end{tabulary}

The error seems to be due to some bug at Sphinx PDF output:
when multicolumns is used, it doesn't accept an empty string.

Just removing the :cpan:`1` and replacing by two empty
columns fix the issue.
