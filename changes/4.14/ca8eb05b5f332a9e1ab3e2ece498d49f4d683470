MIPS: math-emu: Remove pr_err() calls from fpu_emu()

The FPU emulator includes 2 calls to pr_err() which are triggered by
invalid instruction encodings for MIPSr6 cmp.cond.fmt instructions.
These cases are not kernel errors, merely invalid instructions which are
already handled by delivering a SIGILL which will provide notification
that something failed in cases where that makes sense.

In cases where that SIGILL is somewhat expected & being handled, for
example when crashme happens to generate one of the affected bad
encodings, the message is printed with no useful context about what
triggered it & spams the kernel log for no good reason.

Remove the pr_err() calls to make crashme run silently & treat the bad
encodings the same way we do others, with a SIGILL & no further kernel
log output.
