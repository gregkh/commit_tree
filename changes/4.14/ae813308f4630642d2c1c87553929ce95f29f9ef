locking/lockdep: Avoid creating redundant links

Two boots + a make defconfig, the first didn't have the redundant bit
in, the second did:

 lock-classes:                         1168       1169 [max: 8191]
 direct dependencies:                  7688       5812 [max: 32768]
 indirect dependencies:               25492      25937
 all direct dependencies:            220113     217512
 dependency chains:                    9005       9008 [max: 65536]
 dependency chain hlocks:             34450      34366 [max: 327680]
 in-hardirq chains:                      55         51
 in-softirq chains:                     371        378
 in-process chains:                    8579       8579
 stack-trace entries:                108073      88474 [max: 524288]
 combined max dependencies:       178738560  169094640

 max locking depth:                      15         15
 max bfs queue depth:                   320        329

 cyclic checks:                        9123       9190

 redundant checks:                                5046
 redundant links:                                 1828

 find-mask forwards checks:            2564       2599
 find-mask backwards checks:          39521      39789

So it saves nearly 2k links and a fair chunk of stack-trace entries, but
as expected, makes no real difference on the indirect dependencies.

At the same time, you see the max BFS depth increase, which is also
expected, although it could easily be boot variance -- these numbers are
not entirely stable between boots.

The down side is that the cycles in the graph become larger and thus
the reports harder to read.

XXX: do we want this as a CONFIG variable, implied by LOCKDEP_SMALL?
