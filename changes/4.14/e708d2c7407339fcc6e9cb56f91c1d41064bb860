staging: wlan-ng: Use little-endian type

Fix the following sparse warning:
drivers/staging//wlan-ng/prism2sta.c:1691:20: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)

The authantication data is in little endian order. Change the types to little endian order:
(a) Change struct hfa384x_authenticate_station_data status, algorithm members type to __le16.
(b) Change struct hfa384x_auth_request algorithm member type to __le16.
(c) All assignment to status are converted to little-endian prior to assignment.
