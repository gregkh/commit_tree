powerpc/powernv: Add IMC OPAL APIs

In-Memory Collection (IMC) counters are performance monitoring
infrastructure. These counters need special sequence of SCOMs to
init/start/stop which is handled by OPAL. And OPAL provides three APIs
to init and control these IMC engines.

OPAL API documentation:

Patch updates the kernel side powernv platform code to support the new
OPAL APIs
