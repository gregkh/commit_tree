pty: show associative slave of ptmx in fdinfo

This patch adds "tty-index" field to /proc/PID/fdinfo/N if N
specifies /dev/ptmx. The field shows the index of associative
slave pts.

Though a minor number is given for each pts instance, ptmx is not.
It means there is no way in user-space to know the association between
file descriptors for pts/n and ptmx. (n = 0, 1, ...)

This is different from pipe. About pipe such association can be solved
by inode of pipefs.

Providing the way to know the association between pts/n and ptmx helps
users understand the status of running system. lsof can utilize this field.
