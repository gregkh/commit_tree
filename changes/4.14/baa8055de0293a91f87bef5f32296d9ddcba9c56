w1: ds1wm: make endian clean and use standard io memory accessors

o Make endian clean, make HW-endianness configurable.

o Use ioread*, iowrite* instead of __raw_readb,__raw_writeb
  to also use memory-barriers when accessing HW-registers.
  We do not want reordering to happen here.

Both changes are tightly coupled, so I do them in one patch
