mac80211: fix VLAN handling with TXQs

With TXQs, the AP_VLAN interfaces are resolved to their owner AP
interface when enqueuing the frame, which makes sense since the
frame really goes out on that as far as the driver is concerned.

However, this introduces a problem: frames to be encrypted with
a VLAN-specific GTK will now be encrypted with the AP GTK, since
the information about which virtual interface to use to select
the key is taken from the TXQ.

Fix this by preserving info->control.vif and using that in the
dequeue function. This now requires doing the driver-mapping
in the dequeue as well.

Since there's no way to filter the frames that are sitting on a
TXQ, drop all frames, which may affect other interfaces, when an
AP_VLAN is removed.
