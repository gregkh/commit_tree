scsi: cxlflash: Avoid double mutex unlock

The AFU recovery routine uses an interruptible mutex to control the flow
of in-flight recoveries. Upon receiving an interruptible signal the code
branches to a common exit path which wrongly assumes the mutex is
held. Add a local variable to track when the mutex should be unlocked.
