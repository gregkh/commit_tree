extcon: cros-ec: Add extcon-cros-ec driver to support display out

This is the driver for the USB Type C cable detection mechanism
built into the ChromeOS Embedded Controller on systems that
have USB Type-C ports.

At present, this allows for the presence of display out, but in
future, it may also be used to notify host and device type cables
and the presence of power.
