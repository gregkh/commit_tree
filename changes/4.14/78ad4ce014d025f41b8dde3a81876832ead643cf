btrfs: propagate error to btrfs_cmp_data_prepare caller

btrfs_cmp_data_prepare() (almost) always returns 0 i.e. ignoring errors
from gather_extent_pages(). While the pages are freed by
btrfs_cmp_data_free(), cmp->num_pages still has > 0. Then,
btrfs_extent_same() try to access the already freed pages causing faults
(or violates PageLocked assertion).

This patch just return the error as is so that the caller stop the process.
