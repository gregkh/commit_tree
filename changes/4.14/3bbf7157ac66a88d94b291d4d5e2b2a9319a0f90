arm64: Convert pte handling from inline asm to using (cmp)xchg

With the support for hardware updates of the access and dirty states,
the following pte handling functions had to be implemented using
exclusives: __ptep_test_and_clear_young(), ptep_get_and_clear(),
ptep_set_wrprotect() and ptep_set_access_flags(). To take advantage of
the LSE atomic instructions and also make the code cleaner, convert
these pte functions to use the more generic cmpxchg()/xchg().
