userfaultfd: provide pid in userfault msg - add feat union

No ABI change, but this will make it more explicit to software that ptid
is only available if requested by passing UFFD_FEATURE_THREAD_ID to
UFFDIO_API.  The fact it's a union will also self document it shouldn't
be taken for granted there's a tpid there.
