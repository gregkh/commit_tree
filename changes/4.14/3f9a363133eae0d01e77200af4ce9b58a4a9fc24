pwm: rockchip: Add rk3328 support

The rk3328 SoC supports atomic update, we could lock the configuration
of period and duty at first, after unlock is configured, the period and
duty are effective at the same time.

If the polarity, period and duty need to be configured together,
the way for atomic update is "configure lock and old polarity" ->
"configure period and duty" -> "configure unlock and new polarity".
