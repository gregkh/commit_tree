serial: 8250_uniphier: use CHAR register for canary to detect power-off

The 8250 core uses the SCR as a canary to discover if the console has
been powered-off.

This hardware does not have SCR at offset 7, but an unused register
CHAR at a different offset.  As long as the character interrupt is
disabled, the register access has no impact, so it is useful as an
alternative scratch register.
