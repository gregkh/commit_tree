arm64: factor out entry stack manipulation

In subsequent patches, we will detect stack overflow in our exception
entry code, by verifying the SP after it has been decremented to make
space for the exception regs.

This verification code is small, and we can minimize its impact by
placing it directly in the vectors. To avoid redundant modification of
the SP, we also need to move the initial decrement of the SP into the
vectors.

As a preparatory step, this patch introduces kernel_ventry, which
performs this decrement, and updates the entry code accordingly.
Subsequent patches will fold SP verification into kernel_ventry.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
