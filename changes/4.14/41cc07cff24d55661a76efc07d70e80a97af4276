drm/amdgpu: don't finish the ring if not initialized

If a ring is not initialized, it also should not be finished.
For example, in Vega10's SR-IOV environment, UVD's decode ring is not
initialized, but will be finnished in amdgpu_uvd_sw_fini, because UVD
driver put all the uvd decode ring's finish operation into
amdgpu_uvd_sw_fini function, while not uvd_vXXX_0_sw_fini. This will
lead to amdgpu module unloading failure.
