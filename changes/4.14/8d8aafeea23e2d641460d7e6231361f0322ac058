btrfs: Simplify math in should_alloc chunk

Currently should_alloc_chunk uses ->total_bytes - ->bytes_readonly to
signify the total amount of bytes in this space info. However, given
Jeff's patch which adds bytes_pinned and bytes_may_use to the calculation
of num_allocated it becomes a lot more clear to just eliminate num_bytes
altogether and add the bytes_readonly to the amount of used space. That
way we don't change the results of the following statements. In the
process also start using btrfs_space_info_used.
