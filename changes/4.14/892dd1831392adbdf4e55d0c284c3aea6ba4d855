mtd: nand: atmel: fix of_irq_get() error check

of_irq_get() may return 0 as well as negative error number on failure,
while the driver only checks for the negative values. The driver would
then call devm_request_irq() for IRQ0  in its probe method and never get
a valid interrupt.

Check for 'nc->irq <= 0' instead and return -ENXIO from the driver's probe
if of_irq_get() returned 0.
