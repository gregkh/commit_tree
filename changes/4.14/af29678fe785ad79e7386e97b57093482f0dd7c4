arm64: Remove the !CONFIG_ARM64_HW_AFDBM alternative code paths

Since the pte handling for hardware AF/DBM works even when the hardware
feature is not present, make the pte accessors implementation permanent
and remove the corresponding #ifdefs. The Kconfig option is kept as it
can still be used to disable the feature at the hardware level.
