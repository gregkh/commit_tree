IB/cma: Fix erroneous validation of supported default GID type

When rdma_cm is initializing a cma_device it checks if this device
supports the preferred default GID type. This check was done in a wrong way
and therefore sometimes rdma_cm is coming up with default GID type that is
not supported by the device.

Fix that by checking for supported GID type properly.
