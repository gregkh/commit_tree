cifs: Check for timeout on Negotiate stage

Some servers seem to accept connections while booting but never send
the SMBNegotiate response neither close the connection, causing all
processes accessing the share hang on uninterruptible sleep state.

This happens when the cifs_demultiplex_thread detects the server is
unresponsive so releases the socket and start trying to reconnect.
At some point, the faulty server will accept the socket and the TCP
status will be set to NeedNegotiate. The first issued command accessing
the share will start the negotiation (pid 5828 below), but the response
will never arrive so other commands will be blocked waiting on the mutex
(pid 55352).

This patch checks for unresponsive servers also on the negotiate stage
releasing the socket and reconnecting if the response is not received
and checking again the tcp state when the mutex is acquired.
