net_sched: avoid matching qdisc with zero handle

Davide found the following script triggers a NULL pointer
dereference:

ip l a name eth0 type dummy
tc q a dev eth0 parent :1 handle 1: htb

This is because for a freshly created netdevice noop_qdisc
is attached and when passing 'parent :1', kernel actually
tries to match the major handle which is 0 and noop_qdisc
has handle 0 so is matched by mistake. Commit 69012ae425d7
tries to fix a similar bug but still misses this case.

Handle 0 is not a valid one, should be just skipped. In
fact, kernel uses it as TC_H_UNSPEC.

Fixes: 69012ae425d7 ("net: sched: fix handling of singleton qdiscs with qdisc_hash")
Fixes: 59cc1f61f09c ("net: sched:convert qdisc linked list to hashtable")
