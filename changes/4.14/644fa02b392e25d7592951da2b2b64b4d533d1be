ARC: [plat-eznps] use schd.wft instruction instead of sleep at idle task

When HW threads are active we want CPU to enter idle state only
for the calling HW thread and not to put on sleep all HW threads
sharing this core. For this need the NPS400 got dedicated instruction
so only calling thread is entring sleep and all other are still awake
and can execute instructions.
