perf annotate: Introduce struct sym_hist_entry

struct sym_hist has addr[] but it should have not only number of samples
but also the sample period.  So use new struct symhist_entry to pave the
way to have that.

Committer notes:

This initial patch will only introduce the struct sym_hist_entry and use
only the nr_samples member, which makes the code clearer and paves the
way to save the period as well.
