drivers/pps: aesthetic tweaks to PPS-related content

Collection of aesthetic adjustments to various PPS-related files,
directories and Documentation, some quite minor just for the sake of
consistency, including:

 * Updated example of pps device tree node (courtesy Rodolfo G.)
 * "PPS-API" -> "PPS API"
 * "pps_source_info_s" -> "pps_source_info"
 * "ktimer driver" -> "pps-ktimer driver"
 * "ppstest /dev/pps0" -> "ppstest /dev/pps1" to match example
 * Add missing PPS-related entries to MAINTAINERS file
 * Other trivialities
