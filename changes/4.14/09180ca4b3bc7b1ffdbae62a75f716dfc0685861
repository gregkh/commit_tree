mm/gup: make __gup_device_* require THP

These functions are the only bits of generic code that use
{pud,pmd}_pfn() without checking for CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE.  This
works fine on x86, the only arch with devmap support, since the *_pfn()
functions are always defined there, but this isn't true for every
architecture.
