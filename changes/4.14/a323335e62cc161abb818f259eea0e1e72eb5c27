selftests: lib.mk: print individual test results to console by default

Change run_tests to print individual test results to console by default.
Introduce "summary" option to print individual test results to a file
/tmp/test_name and just print the summary to the console.

This change is necessary to support use-cases where test machines get
rebooted once tests are run and the console log should contain the full
results.

In the following example, individual test results with "summary=1" option
are written to /tmp/kcmp_test

make --silent TARGETS=kcmp kselftest
