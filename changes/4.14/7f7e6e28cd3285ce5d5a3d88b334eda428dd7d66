s390/spinlock: add niai spinlock hints

The z14 machine introduces new mode of the next-instruction-access-intent
NIAI instruction. With NIAI-8 it is possible to pin a cache-line on a
CPU for a small amount of time, NIAI-7 releases the cache-line again.
Finally NIAI-4 can be used to prevent the CPU to speculatively access
memory beyond the compare-and-swap instruction to get the lock.

Use these instruction in the spinlock code.
