ovl: fix false positive ESTALE on lookup

Commit b9ac5c274b8c ("ovl: hash overlay non-dir inodes by copy up origin")
verifies that the origin lower inode stored in the overlayfs inode matched
the inode of a copy up origin dentry found by lookup.

There is a false positive result in that check when lower fs does not
support file handles and copy up origin cannot be followed by file handle
at lookup time.

The false negative happens when finding an overlay inode in cache on a
copied up overlay dentry lookup. The overlay inode still 'remembers' the
copy up origin inode, but the copy up origin dentry is not available for
verification.

Relax the check in case copy up origin dentry is not available.
