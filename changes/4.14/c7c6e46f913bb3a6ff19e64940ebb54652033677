drm/i915: Convert execbuf to use struct-of-array packing for critical fields

When userspace is doing most of the work, avoiding relocs (using
NO_RELOC) and opting out of implicit synchronisation (using ASYNC), we
still spend a lot of time processing the arrays in execbuf, even though
we now should have nothing to do most of the time. One issue that
becomes readily apparent in profiling anv is that iterating over the
large execobj[] is unfriendly to the loop prefetchers of the CPU and it
much prefers iterating over a pair of arrays rather than one big array.

v2: Clear vma[] on construction to handle errors during vma lookup
