Staging: pi433: check error after kthread_run()

Error should be checked with IS_ERR after calling kthread_run()
instead of comparing the returned pointer to an int.

Found by sparse warning:

incompatible types for operation (<)
    left side has type struct task_struct *tx_task_struct
    right side has type int
