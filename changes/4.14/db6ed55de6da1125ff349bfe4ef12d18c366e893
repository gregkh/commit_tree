ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Populate module data from topology manifest

All the module common data will now be populated in the topology
manifest. This includes the resource and interface list supported by
the module. With this, driver need not compute the resources required
by each dsp module for a particular pcm parameter since it comes as a
part of the topology manifest.

So, add functions to parse the manifest tokens to populate the module
config data structure.
