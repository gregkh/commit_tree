s390/dasd: Add discard support for FBA devices

The z/VM hypervisor provides virtual disks (VDISK) which are backed by
main memory of the hypervisor. Those devices are seen as DASD FBA disks
within the Linux guest.

Whenever data is written to such a device, memory is allocated
on-the-fly by z/VM accordingly. This memory, however, is not being freed
if data on the device is deleted by the guest OS.

In order to make memory usable after deletion again, add discard support
to the FBA discipline.

While at it, update comments regarding the DASD_FEATURE_* flags.
