Fix up MAINTAINERS file sorting

Another merge window, another MAINTAINERS file disaster.

People have serious problems with the alphabet and sorting, and poor
Jérôme Glisse and Radim Krčmář get their names mangled by locale issues,
turning them into some mangled mess (probably others do too, but those
two stood out when sorting things again).

And we now have two copies of the same 'AS3645A LED FLASH CONTROLLER
DRIVER' in the tree and in the MAINTAINERS file, but that's a separate
issue - the duplication is real, and I left them as two entries for the
same name.

This does not try to sort the actual section pattern entries, although I
may end up doing that later.
