net: dsa: lan9303: Renamed indirect phy access functions

Preparing for the following fix of MDIO phy access:

Renamed functions that access PHY 1 and 2 indirectly through PMI
registers.

 lan9303_port_phy_reg_wait_for_completion() to
 lan9303_indirect_phy_wait_for_completion()

 lan9303_port_phy_reg_read() to
 lan9303_indirect_phy_read()

 lan9303_port_phy_reg_write() to
 lan9303_indirect_phy_write()

Also changed "val" parameter of lan9303_indirect_phy_write() to u16,
for clarity.
