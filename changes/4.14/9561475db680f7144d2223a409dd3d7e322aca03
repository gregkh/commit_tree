PCI: Fix race condition with driver_override

The driver_override implementation is susceptible to a race condition when
different threads are reading vs. storing a different driver override.  Add
locking to avoid the race condition.

This is in close analogy to commit 6265539776a0 ("driver core: platform:
fix race condition with driver_override") from Adrian Salido.
