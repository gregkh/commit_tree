xen: Don't try to call xen_alloc_p2m_entry() on autotranslating guests

Commit aba831a69632 ("xen: remove tests for pvh mode in pure pv paths")
removed XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap test in xen_alloc_p2m_entry()
since it is assumed that the routine is never called by non-PV guests.

However, alloc_xenballooned_pages() may make this call on a PVH guest.
Prevent this from happening by adding XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap
check there.
