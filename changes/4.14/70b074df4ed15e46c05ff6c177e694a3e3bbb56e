media: fix pdf build with Spinx 1.6

Sphinx 1.6 generates some LaTeX code before each table,
starting its own environment before calling tabulary,
apparently to improve table layout.

The problem is that such environment is incompatible with
adjustbox. While, in thesis, it should be possible to override
it or to redefine tabulary, I was unable to produce such patch.

Also, that would likely break on some future Sphinx version.

So, instead, let's just change the font size on bigger tables,
in order for them to fit into the page size. That is not as
good as adjustbox, and require some manual work, but it should
be less sensitive to Sphinx changes.

While here, adjust a few other tables whose text is exceeding
the cell boundaries.
