net: mvpp2: do not call txq_done from the Tx path when Tx irqs are used

When Tx IRQs are used, txq_bufs_free() can be called from both the Tx
path and from NAPI poll(). This led to CPU stalls as if these two tasks
(Tx and Poll) are scheduled on two CPUs at the same time, DMA unmapping
operations are done on the same txq buffers.

This patch adds a check not to call txq_done() from the Tx path if Tx
interrupts are used as it does not make sense to do so.
