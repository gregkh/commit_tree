usb: renesas_usbhs: fix the BCLR setting condition for non-DCP pipe

This patch fixes an issue that the driver sets the BCLR bit of
{C,Dn}FIFOCTR register to 1 even when it's non-DCP pipe and
the FRDY bit of {C,Dn}FIFOCTR register is set to 1.

Fixes: e8d548d54968 ("usb: renesas_usbhs: fifo became independent from pipe.")
