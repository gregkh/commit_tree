ARM: sun8i: a83t: h8homlet-v2: Enable PMIC part of AXP818 PMIC

The AXP813/AXP818 PMICs used with the A83T/H8 SoCs are actually 2 dies
in one package sharing the serial bus (I2C/RSB) pins. One die is the
actual PMIC. The other is an AC100 codec / RTC combo chip.

This patch enables the RSB controller and adds a device node for the
PMIC die to the h8homlet-v2 device tree. Since the AXP813 and AXP818
are virtually identical, this patch uses the compatible string for
the former as a fallback.
