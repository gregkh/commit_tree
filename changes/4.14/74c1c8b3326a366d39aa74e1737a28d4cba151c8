fbcon: add fbcon=margin:<color> command line option

This adds a new command line option to select the fbcon margin color.

The motivation for this is screens where black does not blend into the
physical surroundings of the screen. For example, using an LCD (not the
backlit kind), white text on a black background is hard to read, so
inverting the colors is preferred. However, when you do this, most of the
screen is filled with white but the margins are still filled with black.
This makes a big, black, backwards 'L' on the screen. By setting
fbcon=margin:7, the margins will be filled with white and the LCD looks as
expected.
