Input: synaptics - disable kernel tracking on SMBus devices

In certain situations kernel tracking seems to be getting confused
and incorrectly reporting the slot of a contact. On example is when
the user does a three finger click or tap and then places two fingers
on the touchpad in the same area. The kernel tracking code seems to
continue to think that there are three contacts on the touchpad and
incorrectly alternates the slot of one of the contacts. The result that
is the input subsystem reports a stream of button press and release
events as the reported slot changes.

Kernel tracking was originally enabled to prevent cursor jumps, but it
is unclear how much of an issue kernel jumps actually are. This patch
simply disabled kernel tracking for now.
