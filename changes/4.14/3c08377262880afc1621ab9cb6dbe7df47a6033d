crypto: scompress - don't sleep with preemption disabled

Due to the use of per-CPU buffers, scomp_acomp_comp_decomp() executes
with preemption disabled, and so whether the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP
flag is set is irrelevant, since we cannot sleep anyway. So disregard
the flag, and use GFP_ATOMIC unconditionally.
