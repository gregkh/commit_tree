qtnfmac: implement cfg80211 channel_switch handler

This patch implements cfg80211 channel_switch handler enabling CSA
channel-switch procedure.

Driver performs only basic validation of the requested new channel
and then sends command to firmware. Beacon IEs are not sent since
beacon update is handled by firmware.
