ACPI / property: Don't evaluate objects for devices w/o handle

Fabricated devices such as LNXPWRBN lack a handle, causing evaluation
of _CCA and _DSD to always fail with AE_BAD_PARAMETER.  While that is
merely a (negligible) waste of processing power, evaluating a _DSM for
them (such as Apple's device properties _DSM which we're about to add)
results in an ugly error:

    ACPI: \: failed to evaluate _DSM (0x1001)

Avoid by not evaluating _DSD and the upcoming _DSM for devices without
handle.
