dt-bindings: Drop k2g genpd device ID macros

Commit 7cc119f29b19 ("dt-bindings: Add TI SCI PM Domains") introduced a
number of K2G_DEV_x macros to represent each device ID available on the
K2G platform for use by the genpd, clock, and reset drivers. Rather than
use these macros, which are only used in the device tree for property
values and not actually used by the drivers, let's just use the device
ID number directly in the device tree to avoid macro bloat.
