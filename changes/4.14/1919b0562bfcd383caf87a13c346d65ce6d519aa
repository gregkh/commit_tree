staging: r8822be: fix null pointer dereference with a null driver_adapter

The call to _rtl_dbg_trace via macro HALMAC_RT_TRACE will trigger a null
pointer deference on the null driver_adapter.  Fix this by assigning
driver_adapter earlier to halmac_adapter->driver_adapter before the tracing
call so that a non-null driver_adapter is passed instead.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1454613 ("Explicit null dereferenced")
