qlcnic: remove redundant zero check on retries counter

At the end of the do while loop the integer counter retries will
always be zero and so the subsequent check to see if it is zero
is always true and therefore redundant.  Remove the redundant check
and always return -EIO on this return path.  Also unbreak the literal
string in dev_err message to clean up a checkpatch warning.
