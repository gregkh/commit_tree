coresight: Add barrier packet for synchronisation

When a buffer overflow happens the synchronisation patckets usually
present at the beginning of the buffer are lost, a situation that
prevents the decoder from knowing the context of the traces being
decoded.

This patch adds a barrier packet to be used by sink IPs when a buffer
overflow condition is detected.  These barrier packets are then used
by the decoding library as markers to force re-synchronisation.
