USB: core: harden cdc_parse_cdc_header

Andrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for the
cdc_parse_cdc_header function.  He writes:
	It looks like cdc_parse_cdc_header() doesn't validate buflen
	before accessing buffer[1], buffer[2] and so on. The only check
	present is while (buflen > 0).

So fix this issue up by properly validating the buffer length matches
what the descriptor says it is.
