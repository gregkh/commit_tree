ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Parse and update module config structure

A dsp path and the modules in the path can support various pcm
configurations. The list of supported pcm configurations from topology
manifest would be stored and later selected runtime based on the hw
pcm params. For legacy, module data is filled in the 0th index of
resource and interface table.

To accommodate both models, change the relevant structures and populate
them by parsing newly defined tokens. This change is backward compatible
with the existing model where driver computes the resources required by
each dsp module.
