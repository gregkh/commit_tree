powerpc/32: remove a NOP from memset()

memset() is patched after initialisation to activate the
optimised part which uses cache instructions.

Today we have a 'b 2f' to skip the optimised patch, which then gets
replaced by a NOP, implying a useless cycle consumption.
As we have a 'bne 2f' just before, we could use that instruction
for the live patching, hence removing the need to have a
dedicated 'b 2f' to be replaced by a NOP.

This patch changes the 'bne 2f' by a 'b 2f'. During init, that
'b 2f' is then replaced by 'bne 2f'
