xdp: adjust xdp redirect tracepoint to include return error code

The return error code need to be included in the tracepoint
xdp:xdp_redirect, else its not possible to distinguish successful or
failed XDP_REDIRECT transmits.

XDP have no queuing mechanism. Thus, it is fairly easily to overrun a
NIC transmit queue.  The eBPF program invoking helpers (bpf_redirect
or bpf_redirect_map) to redirect a packet doesn't get any feedback
whether the packet was actually transmitted.

Info on failed transmits in the tracepoint xdp:xdp_redirect, is
interesting as this opens for providing a feedback-loop to the
receiving XDP program.
