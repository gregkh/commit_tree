staging: r8822be: Add code for halmac sub-driver

The RTL8822BE, an 802.11ac wireless network card, is now appearing in
new computers. Its driver is being placed in staging to reduce the time
that users of this new card will have access to in-kernel drivers.

New Realtek devices implement a common sub-driver to control the MAC
layer. The RTL8822BE is the first of these devices, thus its introduction
involves some extra code. In the wireless tree, this will be a separate
module; however, it is compiled into the 8822be driver here.
