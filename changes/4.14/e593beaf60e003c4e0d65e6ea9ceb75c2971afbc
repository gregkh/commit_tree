phy: ralink: fix 64-bit build warning

Casting between an 'int' and a pointer causes a warning on
64-bit architectures in compile-testing this driver:

drivers/phy/ralink/phy-ralink-usb.c: In function 'ralink_usb_phy_probe':
drivers/phy/ralink/phy-ralink-usb.c:195:13: error: cast from pointer to
integer of different size [-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast]

This changes the code to cast to uintptr_t instead. This is
guaranteed to do what we want on all architectures and avoids
the warning.
