bcache: initialize dirty stripes in flash_dev_run()

bcache uses a Proportion-Differentiation Controller algorithm to control
writeback rate to cached devices. In the PD controller algorithm, dirty
stripes of thin flash device should not be counted in, because flash only
volumes never write back dirty data.

Currently dirty stripe counter for thin flash device is not initialized
when the thin flash device starts. Which means the following calculation
in PD controller will reference an undefined dirty stripes number, and
all cached devices attached to the same cache set where the thin flash
device lies on may have an inaccurate writeback rate.

This patch calles bch_sectors_dirty_init() in flash_dev_run(), to
correctly initialize dirty stripe counter when the thin flash device
starts to run. This patch also does following parameter data type change,
 -void bch_sectors_dirty_init(struct cached_dev *dc);
 +void bch_sectors_dirty_init(struct bcache_device *);
to call this function conveniently in flash_dev_run().
