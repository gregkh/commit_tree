Input: elants_i2c - constify attribute_group structures

attribute_groups are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_groups provided by <linux/sysfs.h> work with const
attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   9448	   1008	      0	  10456	   28d8	drivers/input/touchscreen/elants_i2c.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   9496	    944	      0	  10440	   28c8	drivers/input/touchscreen/elants_i2c.o
