powerpc: Emulate the dcbz instruction

This adds code to analyse_instr() and emulate_step() to understand the
dcbz (data cache block zero) instruction.  The emulate_dcbz() function
is made public so it can be used by the alignment handler in future.
(The apparently unnecessary cropping of the address to 32 bits is
there because it will be needed in that situation.)
