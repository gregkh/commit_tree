docs RTD theme: code-block with line nos - lines and line numbers don't line up.

In a code-block with line numbers (option :lineno:) there is a
misalignment of the rendered source code lines on the right side and the
line numbers on the left side.

Since this issue is reported to the RTD theme project, it might be fixed
in the future (take this as a interim solution).
