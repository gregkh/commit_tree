drivers/watchdog: Add optional ASPEED device tree properties

Describe device tree optional properties:

  * aspeed,reset-type = "cpu|soc|system|none"
     One of three different, mutually exclusive, values

	"cpu" : ARM CPU reset on signal
	"soc" : 'System on chip' reset
	"system" : Full system reset

     The value can also be set to "none" which indicates that no
     reset of any kind is to be done via this watchdog.  This assumes
     another watchdog on the chip is to take care of resets.

  * aspeed,external-signal - Generate external signal (WDT1 and WDT2 only)
  * aspeed,alt-boot - Boot from alternate block on signal
