locking/lockdep: Apply crossrelease to completions

Although wait_for_completion() and its family can cause deadlock, the
lock correctness validator could not be applied to them until now,
because things like complete() are usually called in a different context
from the waiting context, which violates lockdep's assumption.

Thanks to CONFIG_LOCKDEP_CROSSRELEASE, we can now apply the lockdep
detector to those completion operations. Applied it.
