net: hns3: Cleanup for ROCE capability flag in ae_dev

This patch add the ROCE supported flag in the driver_data
field of pci_device_id, delete roce_pci_tbl and change
HNAE_DEV_SUPPORT_ROCE_B to HNAE3_DEV_SUPPORT_ROCE_B.
This cleanup is done in order to support adding capability
in pci_device_id and to fix initialization failure when
cmd is not supported.
