mfd: intel_soc_pmic_chtwc: Turn Kconfig option into a bool

The PMIC provides ACPI OpRegions which must be available for other
drivers' PS0 / PS3 methods early-on as such it must be builtin as the
Kconfig help text already states.

Somehow its Kconfig option ended up being a tristate though, this fixes
this.
