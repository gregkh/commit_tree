powerpc/32: Avoid risk of unrecoverable TLBmiss inside entry_32.S

By default, the 8xx pins an ITLB on the first 8M of memory in order
to avoid any ITLB miss on kernel code.
However, with some debug functions like DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and
DEBUG_RODATA, pinning TLBs is contradictory.

In order to avoid any ITLB miss in a critical section without pinning
TLBs, we have to ensure that there is no page boundary crossed between
the setup of a new value in SRR0/SRR1 and the associated RFI.

The functions modifying srr0/srr1 are all located in setup_32.S.
They are spread over almost 4kbytes.

The patch forces a 12 bits (4kbytes) alignment for those
functions. This garanties that the functions remain in a
single 4k page.
