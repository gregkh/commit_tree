s390/mm: fix race on mm->context.flush_mm

The order in __tlb_flush_mm_lazy is to flush TLB first and then clear
the mm->context.flush_mm bit. This can lead to missed flushes as the
bit can be set anytime, the order needs to be the other way aronud.

But this leads to a different race, __tlb_flush_mm_lazy may be called
on two CPUs concurrently. If mm->context.flush_mm is cleared first then
another CPU can bypass __tlb_flush_mm_lazy although the first CPU has
not done the flush yet. In a virtualized environment the time until the
flush is finally completed can be arbitrarily long.

Add a spinlock to serialize __tlb_flush_mm_lazy and use the function
in finish_arch_post_lock_switch as well.
