ACPICA: Tables: Do not validate signature for dynamic table load

ACPICA commit d3c944f2cdc8c7e847b7942b1864f285189f7bce

Windows seems to allow arbitrary table signatures for Load/load_table
opcodes:
  ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Table has invalid signature [PRAD] (0x44415250)
So this patch removes dynamic load signature checks. However we need to
find a way to avoid table loading against tables like MADT. This is not
covered by this commit.

This Windows behavior has been validated on link #1. An end user bug
report can also be found on link #2.

This patch also includes simple cleanup for static load signature check
code. Reported by Ye Xiaolong, Fixed by Lv Zheng.
