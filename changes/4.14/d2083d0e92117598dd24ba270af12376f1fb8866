net: hns: set correct return value

The function of_parse_phandle() returns a NULL pointer if it cannot
resolve a phandle property to a device_node pointer. In function
hns_nic_dev_probe(), its return value is passed to PTR_ERR to extract
the error code. However, in this case, the extracted error code will
always be zero, which is unexpected.
