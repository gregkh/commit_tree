KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: POWER9 does not require secondary thread management

POWER9 CPUs have independent MMU contexts per thread, so KVM does not
need to quiesce secondary threads, so the hwthread_req/hwthread_state
protocol does not have to be used. So patch it away on POWER9, and patch
away the branch from the Linux idle wakeup to kvm_start_guest that is
never used.

Add a warning and error out of kvmppc_grab_hwthread in case it is ever
called on POWER9.

This avoids a hwsync in the idle wakeup path on POWER9.
