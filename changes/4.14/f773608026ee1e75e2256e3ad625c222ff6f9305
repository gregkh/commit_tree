netlink: access nlk groups safely in netlink bind and getname

Now there is no lock protecting nlk ngroups/groups' accessing in
netlink bind and getname. It's safe from nlk groups' setting in
netlink_release, but not from netlink_realloc_groups called by
netlink_setsockopt.

netlink_lock_table is needed in both netlink bind and getname when
accessing nlk groups.
