powerpc/32: add memset16()

Commit 694fc88ce271f ("powerpc/string: Implement optimized
memset variants") added memset16(), memset32() and memset64()
for the 64 bits PPC.

On 32 bits, memset64() is not relevant, and as shown below,
the generic version of memset32() gives a good code, so only
memset16() is candidate for an optimised version.

000009c0 <memset32>:
 9c0:   2c 05 00 00     cmpwi   r5,0
 9c4:   39 23 ff fc     addi    r9,r3,-4
 9c8:   4d 82 00 20     beqlr
 9cc:   7c a9 03 a6     mtctr   r5
 9d0:   94 89 00 04     stwu    r4,4(r9)
 9d4:   42 00 ff fc     bdnz    9d0 <memset32+0x10>
 9d8:   4e 80 00 20     blr

The last part of memset() handling the not 4-bytes multiples
operates on bytes, making it unsuitable for handling word without
modification. As it would increase memset() complexity, it is
better to implement memset16() from scratch. In addition it
has the advantage of allowing a more optimised memset16() than what
we would have by using the memset() function.
