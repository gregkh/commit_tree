netfilter: nf_tables: support for recursive chain deletion

This patch sorts out an asymmetry in deletions. Currently, table and set
deletion commands come with an implicit content flush on deletion.
However, chain deletion results in -EBUSY if there is content in this
chain, so no implicit flush happens. So you have to send a flush command
in first place to delete chains, this is inconsistent and it can be
annoying in terms of user experience.

This patch uses the new NLM_F_NONREC flag to request non-recursive chain
deletion, ie. if the chain to be removed contains rules, then this
returns EBUSY. This problem was discussed during the NFWS'17 in Faro,
Portugal. In iptables, you hit -EBUSY if you try to delete a chain that
contains rules, so you have to flush first before you can remove
anything. Since iptables-compat uses the nf_tables netlink interface, it
has to use the NLM_F_NONREC flag from userspace to retain the original
iptables semantics, ie.  bail out on removing chains that contain rules.
