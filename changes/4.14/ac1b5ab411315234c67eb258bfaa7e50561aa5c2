drm/msm: Add A5XX hardware fault detection

The A5XX GPU has really good hardware fault detection that can
detect a abnormal hardware condition and fire an interrupt in
a matter of milliseconds which is a lot better than waiting for
the hangcheck timer.

Enable the interrupt and log information before kicking off
recovery.
