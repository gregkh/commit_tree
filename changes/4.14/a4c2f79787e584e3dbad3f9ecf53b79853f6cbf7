MIPS: Prevent direct use of generic_defconfig

Using generic_defconfig directly is unlikely to be what a user actually
wants to do - it doesn't specify any particular ISA revision & it
doesn't enable any board or driver support, resulting in a largely
useless kernel.

Prevent users from using it directly, printing a helpful message to
point them in the right direction if they attempt to.
