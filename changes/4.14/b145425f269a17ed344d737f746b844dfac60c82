inetpeer: remove AVL implementation in favor of RB tree

As discussed in Faro during Netfilter Workshop 2017, RB trees can be
used with RCU, using a seqlock.

Note that net/rxrpc/conn_service.c is already using this.

This patch converts inetpeer from AVL tree to RB tree, since it allows
to remove private AVL implementation in favor of shared RB code.

$ size net/ipv4/inetpeer.before net/ipv4/inetpeer.after
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3195      40     128    3363     d23 net/ipv4/inetpeer.before
   1562      24       0    1586     632 net/ipv4/inetpeer.after

The same technique can be used to speed up
net/netfilter/nft_set_rbtree.c (removing rwlock contention in fast path)
