rxrpc: Move the packet.h include file into net/rxrpc/

Move the protocol description header file into net/rxrpc/ and rename it to
protocol.h.  It's no longer necessary to expose it as packets are no longer
exposed to kernel services (such as AFS) that use the facility.

The abort codes are transferred to the UAPI header instead as we pass these
back to userspace and also to kernel services.
