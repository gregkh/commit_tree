ASoC: samsung: odroid: Drop requirement of clocks in the sound node

As suggested in reviews the requirement of clocks in the 'sound' node
is dropped and instead a leaf clock is used to configure frequency
of the audio root clock PLL. This can work now after the clock tree
definitions have been updated to allow clock rate setting propagation
on the path from the I2S controller up to the EPLL.

This patch also lowers the CODEC master clock frequency so as
to not exceed the maximum allowed 60 MHz at maximum audio sampling
rates.
