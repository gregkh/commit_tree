dt-bindings: display: rcar-du: Add a VSP channel index to the vsps DT property

On some R-Car SoCs a single VSP can serve multiple DU channels through
multiple LIF instances in the VSP. The current DT bindings don't support
specifying that kind of SoC integration scheme. Extend them with a VSP
channel index.

Backward compatibility can be ensured in drivers by checking the length
of the vsps property and setting the channel to 0 when the property
doesn't contain channel indices.
