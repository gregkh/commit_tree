nfp: refuse offloading filters that redirects to upper devices

Previously we did not ensure that a netdev is a representative netdev
before dereferencing its private data. This can occur when an upper netdev
is created on a representative netdev. This patch corrects this by first
ensuring that the netdev is a representative netdev before using it.
Checking only switchdev_port_same_parent_id is not sufficient to ensure
that we can safely use the netdev. Failing to check that the netdev is also
a representative netdev would result in incorrect dereferencing.
