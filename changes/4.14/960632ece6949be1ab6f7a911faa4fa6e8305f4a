netfilter: convert hook list to an array

This converts the storage and layout of netfilter hook entries from a
linked list to an array.  After this commit, hook entries will be
stored adjacent in memory.  The next pointer is no longer required.

The ops pointers are stored at the end of the array as they are only
used in the register/unregister path and in the legacy br_netfilter code.

nf_unregister_net_hooks() is slower than needed as it just calls
nf_unregister_net_hook in a loop (i.e. at least n synchronize_net()
calls), this will be addressed in followup patch.

Test setup:
 - ixgbe 10gbit
 - netperf UDP_STREAM, 64 byte packets
 - 5 hooks: (raw + mangle prerouting, mangle+filter input, inet filter):
empty mangle and raw prerouting, mangle and filter input hooks:
