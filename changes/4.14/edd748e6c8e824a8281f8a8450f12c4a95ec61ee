f2fs: avoid race in between atomic_read & atomic_inc

Previously, we will miss merging flush command during fsync due to below
race condition:

Thread A 		Thread B		Thread C
- f2fs_issue_flush
 - atomic_read(&issing_flush)
			- f2fs_issue_flush
			 - atomic_read(&issing_flush)
						- f2fs_issue_flush
						 - atomic_read(&issing_flush)
  - atomic_inc(&issing_flush)
			  - atomic_inc(&issing_flush)
						  - atomic_inc(&issing_flush)
   - submit_flush_wait
			   - submit_flush_wait
						   - submit_flush_wait

It needs to use atomic_inc_return instead to avoid such race.
