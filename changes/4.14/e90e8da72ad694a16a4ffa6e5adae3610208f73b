mmc: tmio: fix swiotlb buffer is full

Since the commit de3ee99b097d ("mmc: Delete bounce buffer handling")
deletes the bounce buffer handling, a request data size will be referred
to max_{req,seg}_size instead of MMC_QUEUE_BOUNCESZ (64k bytes).

In other hand, renesas_sdhi_internal_dmac.c will set very big value of
max_{req,seg}_size because the max_blk_count is set to 0xffffffff.
And then, "swiotlb buffer is full" happens because swiotlb can handle
a memory size up to 256k bytes only (IO_TLB_SEGSIZE = 128 and
IO_TLB_SHIFT = 11).

So, as a workaround, this patch avoids the issue by setting
the max_{req,seg}_size up to 256k bytes if swiotlb is running.
