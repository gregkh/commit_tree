rsi: fix static checker warning

u32 pointer is changed to u16 and filled the value. Problem is
solved by using local temporary variable. Below static checker
warning was reported.

drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_usb.c:400 rsi_usb_master_reg_read()
        warn: passing casted pointer 'value' to 'rsi_usb_reg_read()'
32 vs 16.
