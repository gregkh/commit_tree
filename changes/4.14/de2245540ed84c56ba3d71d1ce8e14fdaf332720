clk: qcom: msm8916: Fix bimc gpu clock ops

The clock bimc_gpu_clk_src is incorrectly set to use the shared rcg2
ops, which are for RCGs with child branches controlled by different
CPUs.

The result of the incorrect ops is that the GPU's PM runtime may leave
this clock set at a very low rate. Fix this issue by using the correct
rcg2 ops.
