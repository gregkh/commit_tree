ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Add support for H3

The sun8i-h3 introduces a lot of changes to the i2s block such
as different register locations, extended clock division and
more operational modes. As we have to consider the earlier
implementation then these changes need to be isolated.

None of the new functionality has been implemented yet, the
driver has just been expanded to allow it work on the H3 SoC.
