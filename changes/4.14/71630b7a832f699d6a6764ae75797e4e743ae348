ACPI / PM: Blacklist Low Power S0 Idle _DSM for Dell XPS13 9360

At least one Dell XPS13 9360 is reported to have serious issues with
the Low Power S0 Idle _DSM interface and since this machine model
generally can do ACPI S3 just fine, add a blacklist entry to disable
that interface for Dell XPS13 9360.
