clocksource/drivers/imx-tpm: Add imx tpm timer support

IMX Timer/PWM Module (TPM) supports both timer and pwm function while
this patch only adds the timer support. PWM would be added later.

The TPM counter, compare and capture registers are clocked by an
asynchronous clock that can remain enabled in low power modes.

NOTE: We observed in a very small probability, the bus fabric
contention between GPU and A7 may results a few cycles delay
of writing CNT registers which may cause the min_delta event got
missed, so we need add a ETIME check here in case it happened.
