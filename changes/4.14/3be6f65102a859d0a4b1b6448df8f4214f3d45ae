pinctrl: imx: make imx_pmx_ops.gpio_set_direction platform specific callbacks

Various IMX platforms may have different imx_pmx_ops.gpio_set_direction
implementations, so let's make it platform specific callbacks instead of
the fixed common one.

Currently only VF610 platform implements it. No function level changes.
