net: can: janz-ican3: constify attribute_group structures.

attribute_group are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_group provided by <linux/netdevice.h> work
with const attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  11800	    368	      0	  12168	   2f88	drivers/net/can/janz-ican3.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  11864	    304	      0	  12168	   2f88	drivers/net/can/janz-ican3.o
