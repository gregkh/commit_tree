x86/mm: Make the SME mask a u64

The SME encryption mask is for masking 64-bit pagetable entries. It
being an unsigned long works fine on X86_64 but on 32-bit builds in
truncates bits leading to Xen guests crashing very early.

And regardless, the whole SME mask handling shouldnt've leaked into
32-bit because SME is X86_64-only feature. So, first make the mask u64.
And then, add trivial 32-bit versions of the __sme_* macros so that
nothing happens there.
