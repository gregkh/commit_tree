MIPS: Unify checks for sibling CPUs

Up until now we have open-coded checks for whether CPUs are siblings,
with slight variations on whether we consider the package ID or not.

This will only get more complex when we introduce cluster support, so in
preparation for that this patch introduces a cpus_are_siblings()
function which can be used to check whether or not 2 CPUs are siblings
in a consistent manner.

By checking globalnumber with the VP ID masked out this also has the
neat side effect of being ready for multi-cluster systems already.
