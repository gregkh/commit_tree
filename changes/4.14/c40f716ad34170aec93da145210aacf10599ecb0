tty: serial: pci: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  12626	  18128	      0	  30754	   7822 tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  23986	   6768	      0	  30754	   7822 tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.o
