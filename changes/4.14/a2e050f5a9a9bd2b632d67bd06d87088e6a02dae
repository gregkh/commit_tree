dax: explain how read(2)/write(2) addresses are validated

Add a comment explaining how the user addresses provided to read(2) and
write(2) are validated in the DAX I/O path.

We call dax_copy_from_iter() or copy_to_iter() on these without calling
access_ok() first in the DAX code, and there was a concern that the user
might be able to read/write to arbitrary kernel addresses with this
path.
