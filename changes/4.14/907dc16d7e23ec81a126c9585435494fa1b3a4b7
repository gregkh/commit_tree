locking/lockdep: Fix the rollback and overwrite detection logic in crossrelease

As Boqun Feng pointed out, current->hist_id should be aligned with the
latest valid xhlock->hist_id so that hist_id_save[] storing current->hist_id
can be comparable with xhlock->hist_id. Fix it.

Additionally, the condition for overwrite-detection should be the
opposite. Fix the code and the comments as well.
