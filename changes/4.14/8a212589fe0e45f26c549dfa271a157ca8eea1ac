rtnetlink: bring NETDEV_CHANGEMTU event process back in rtnetlink_event

Commit 085e1a65f04f ("rtnetlink: Do not generate notifications for MTU
events") tried to fix the redundant notifications issue when ip link
set mtu by removing NETDEV_CHANGEMTU event process in rtnetlink_event.

But it also resulted in no notification generated when dev's mtu is
changed via other methods, like:
  'ifconfig eth1 mtu 1400' or 'echo 1400 > /sys/class/net/eth1/mtu'
It would cause users not to be notified by this change.

This patch is to fix it by bringing NETDEV_CHANGEMTU event back into
rtnetlink_event, and the redundant notifications issue will be fixed
in the later patch 'rtnetlink: check DO_SETLINK_NOTIFY correctly in
do_setlink'.
