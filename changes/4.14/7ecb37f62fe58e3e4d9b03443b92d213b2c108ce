While registering the cpuhoplug callbacks for core-imc, if we fails
in the cpuhotplug online path for any random core (either because opal call to
initialize the core-imc counters fails or because memory allocation fails for
that core), ppc_core_imc_cpu_offline() will get invoked for other cpus who
successfully returned from cpuhotplug online path.

But in the ppc_core_imc_cpu_offline() path we are trying to migrate the event
context, when core-imc counters are not even initialized. Thus creating the
above stack dump.

Add a check to see if core-imc counters are enabled or not in the cpuhotplug
offline path before migrating the context to handle this failing scenario.
