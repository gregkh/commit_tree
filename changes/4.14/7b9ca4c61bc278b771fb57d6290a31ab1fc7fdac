quota: Reduce contention on dq_data_lock

dq_data_lock is currently used to protect all modifications of quota
accounting information, consistency of quota accounting on the inode,
and dquot pointers from inode. As a result contention on the lock can be
pretty heavy.

Reduce the contention on the lock by protecting quota accounting
information by a new dquot->dq_dqb_lock and consistency of quota
accounting with inode usage by inode->i_lock.

This change reduces time to create 500000 files on ext4 on ramdisk by 50
different processes in separate directories by 6% when user quota is
turned on. When those 50 processes belong to 50 different users, the
improvement is about 9%.
