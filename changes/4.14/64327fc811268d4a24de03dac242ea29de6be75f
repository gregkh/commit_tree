ipv4: Don't override return code from ip_route_input_noref()

After ip_route_input() calls ip_route_input_noref(), another
check on skb_dst() is done, but if this fails, we shouldn't
override the return code from ip_route_input_noref(), as it
could have been more specific (i.e. -EHOSTUNREACH).

This also saves one call to skb_dst_force_safe() and one to
skb_dst() in case the ip_route_input_noref() check fails.
