esp6: Fix RX checksum after header pull

Both ip6_input_finish (non-GRO) and esp6_gro_receive (GRO) strip
the IPv6 header without adjusting skb->csum accordingly. As a
result CHECKSUM_COMPLETE breaks and "hw csum failure" is written
to the kernel log by netdev_rx_csum_fault (dev.c).

Fix skb->csum by substracting the checksum value of the pulled IPv6
header using a call to skb_postpull_rcsum.

This affects both transport and tunnel modes.

Note that the fix occurs far from the place that the header was
pulled. This is based on existing code, see:
ipv6_srh_rcv() in exthdrs.c and rawv6_rcv() in raw.c
