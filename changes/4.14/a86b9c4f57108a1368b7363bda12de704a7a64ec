mtd: nand: qcom: erased codeword detection configuration

The NAND controller returns ECC failure during read of completely
erased codeword. The NAND controller has hardware functionality
to detect erased codeword in case of BCH ECC algorithm. The
NAND_ERASED_CW_DETECT_CFG register controls the erased
codeword/page detection controller. This register should be reset
before every page read by setting and clearing bit 0 of
NAND_ERASED_CW_DETECT_CFG.
