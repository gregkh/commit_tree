perf/x86: Only show format attributes when supported

Only show the Intel format attributes in sysfs when the feature is actually
supported with the current model numbers. This allows programs to probe
what format attributes are available, and give a sensible error message
to users if they are not.

This handles near all cases for intel attributes since Nehalem,
except the (obscure) case when the model number if known, but PEBS
is disabled in PERF_CAPABILITIES.
