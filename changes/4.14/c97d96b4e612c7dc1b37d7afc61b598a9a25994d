staging: bcm2835-audio: Fix memory corruption

The previous commit (0adbfd46) fixed a memory leak but also freed a
block in the success case, causing a stale pointer to be used with
potentially fatal results. Only free the vchi_instance block in the
case that vchi_connect fails; once connected, the instance is
retained for subsequent connections.

Simplifying the code by removing a bunch of gotos and returning errors
directly.
