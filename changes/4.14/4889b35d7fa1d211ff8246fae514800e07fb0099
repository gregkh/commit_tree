drm: qxl: Remove unused CRTC .dpms() helper operation

The CRTC .dpms() helper operation is called by the atomic helpers only
when no .prepare(), .atomic_disable() or .disable() operation is
provided. As the qxl driver provides a .disable() operation, the .dpms()
operation is unused and can be removed.
