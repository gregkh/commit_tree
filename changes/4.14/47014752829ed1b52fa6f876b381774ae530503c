Input: edt-ft5x06 - fix access to non-existing register

reg_addr->reg_report_rate is supposed to exist in M06, not M09.

The driver is written to skip avoids access to non-existing registers
when the register address is NO_REGISTER (0xff). But
reg_addr->reg_report_rate is initialized to 0x00 by devm_kzalloc() (in
edt_ft5x06_ts_probe()) and not changed thereafter. So the checks do
not work and an access to register 0x00 is done.

Fix by setting reg_addr->reg_report_rate to NO_REGISTER.

Also fix the only place where reg_report_rate is checked against zero
instead of NO_REGISTER.
