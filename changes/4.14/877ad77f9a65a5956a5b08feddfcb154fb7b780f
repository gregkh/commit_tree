ARM: dts: keystone-k2hk: Add DSP nodes

The Keystone 2 66AK2H/66AK2K SoCs have upto 8 TMS320C66x DSP Core
Subsystems (C66x CorePacs), each with a 1.0 GHz or 1.2 GHz C66x
Fixed/Floating-Point DSP Core, and 32 KB of L1P & L1D SRAMs and a
1 MB L2 SRAM. Add the DT nodes for these DSP processor sub-systems.
The processors do not have an MMU, and use various IPC Generation
registers and shared memory for inter-processor communication.
The aliases with a stem 'rproc' have also been added for all the
DSPs, they provide a fixed remoteproc id to each DSP processor.
