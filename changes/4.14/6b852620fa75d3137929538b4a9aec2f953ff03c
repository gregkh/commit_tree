media: dvb-frontends/stv0910: release lock on gate_ctrl() failure

Whenever write_reg() fails to open/close the demod's I2C gate, release the
lock to avoid deadlocking situations. If I2c gate open failed, there's no
need to hold a lock, and if close fails, the mutex_unlock() at the end of
the function is never reached, leaving the mutex_lock in locked state,
which in turn will cause potential for deadlocks. Thus, release the lock
on failure.

While we're touching gate_ctrl(), add some explanation about the need for
locking and the shared I2C bus/gate.
