cpufreq: Use transition_delay_us for legacy governors as well

The policy->transition_delay_us field is used only by the schedutil
governor currently, and this field describes how fast the driver wants
the cpufreq governor to change CPUs frequency. It should rather be a
common thing across all governors, as it doesn't have any schedutil
dependency here.

Create a new helper cpufreq_policy_transition_delay_us() to get the
transition delay across all governors.
