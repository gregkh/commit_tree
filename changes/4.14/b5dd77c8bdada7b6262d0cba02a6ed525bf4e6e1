sched/numa: Scale scan period with tasks in group and shared/private

Running 80 tasks in the same group, or as threads of the same process,
results in the memory getting scanned 80x as fast as it would be if a
single task was using the memory.

This really hurts some workloads.

Scale the scan period by the number of tasks in the numa group, and
the shared / private ratio, so the average rate at which memory in
the group is scanned corresponds roughly to the rate at which a single
task would scan its memory.
