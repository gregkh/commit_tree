ata_piix: Add Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook S6120 to short cable IDs

Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook S6120 misdetects the cable type for some
drives. The problematic one in this case is an mSATA SSD hooked up via a
mSATA->PATA bridge. With regular hard disks the detection seems to work
correctly.

Strangely an older Lifebook model (S6020) detects the cable as 80c
with the mSATA SSD, even if using the exact same flex cable.
