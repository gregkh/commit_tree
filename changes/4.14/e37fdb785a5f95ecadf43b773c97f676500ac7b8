exec: Use secureexec for setting dumpability

The examination of "current" to decide dumpability is wrong. This was a
check of and euid/uid (or egid/gid) mismatch in the existing process,
not the newly created one. This appears to stretch back into even the
"history.git" tree. Luckily, dumpability is later set in commit_creds().
In earlier kernel versions before creds existed, similar checks also
existed late in the exec flow, covering up the mistake as far back as I
could find.

Note that because the commit_creds() check examines differences of euid,
uid, egid, gid, and capabilities between the old and new creds, it would
look like the setup_new_exec() dumpability test could be entirely removed.
However, the secureexec test may cover a different set of tests (specific
to the LSMs) than what commit_creds() checks for. So, fix this test to
use secureexec (the removed euid tests are redundant to the commoncap
secureexec checks now).
