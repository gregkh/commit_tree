staging: lustre: uapi: don't memory allocate in UAPI header

The inline function lustre_cfg_new() calls kzalloc() but
this is a UAPI header. Remove kzalloc() and rename the
function to lustre_cfg_init(). The lustre kernel code
that was calling lustre_cfg_new() can doing the memory
allocation and pass the new buffer to lustre_cfg_init()
to fill in.
