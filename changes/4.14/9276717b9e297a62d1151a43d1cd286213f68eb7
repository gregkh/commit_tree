bcache: fix bch_hprint crash and improve output

Most importantly, solve a crash where %llu was used to format signed
numbers.  This would cause a buffer overflow when reading sysfs
writeback_rate_debug, as only 20 bytes were allocated for this and
%llu writes 20 characters plus a null.

Always use the units mechanism rather than having different output
paths for simplicity.

Also, correct problems with display output where 1.10 was a larger
number than 1.09, by multiplying by 10 and then dividing by 1024 instead
of dividing by 100.  (Remainders of >= 1000 would print as .10).

Minor changes: Always display the decimal point instead of trying to
omit it based on number of digits shown.  Decide what units to use
based on 1000 as a threshold, not 1024 (in other words, always print
at most 3 digits before the decimal point).
