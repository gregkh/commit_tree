mmc: dw_mmc: cancel the CTO timer after a voltage switch

When running with the commit 03de19212ea3 ("mmc: dw_mmc: introduce
timer for broken command transfer over scheme") I found this message
in the log:
  Unexpected command timeout, state 7

It turns out that we weren't properly cancelling the new CTO timer in
the case that a voltage switch was done.  Let's promote the cancel
into the dw_mci_cmd_interrupt() function to fix this.
