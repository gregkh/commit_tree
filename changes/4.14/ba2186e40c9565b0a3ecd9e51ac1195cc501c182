ALSA: ymfpci: Use common error handling code in snd_ymfpci_create()

* Add a jump target so that a bit of exception handling can be better
  reused at the end of this function.

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* The script "checkpatch.pl" pointed information out like the following.

  ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition

  Thus fix a few source code places.
