KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix case where HDEC is treated as 32-bit on POWER9

Commit 2f2724630f7a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Cope with host using large
decrementer mode", 2017-05-22) added code to treat the hypervisor
decrementer (HDEC) as a 64-bit value on POWER9 rather than 32-bit.
Unfortunately, that commit missed one place where HDEC is treated
as a 32-bit value.  This fixes it.

This bug should not have any user-visible consequences that I can
think of, beyond an occasional unnecessary exit to the host kernel.
If the hypervisor decrementer has gone negative, then the bottom
32 bits will be negative for about 4 seconds after that, so as
long as we get out of the guest within those 4 seconds we won't
conclude that the HDEC interrupt is spurious.
