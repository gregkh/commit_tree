drm/amdgpu: revert tile table update for oland

Several users have complained that the tile table update broke Oland
support. Despite several attempts to fix it, the root cause is still
unknown at this point and no solution is available. As it is not
acceptable to leave a known regression breaking a major functionality
in the kernel for several releases, let's just reverse this
optimization for now. It can be implemented again later if and only
if the breakage is understood and fixed.

As there were no complaints for Hainan so far, only the Oland part of
the offending commit is reverted. Optimization is preserved on
Hainan, so this commit isn't an actual revert of the original.

This fixes bug #194761:
