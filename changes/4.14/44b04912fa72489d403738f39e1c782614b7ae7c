x86/mpx: Do not allow MPX if we have mappings above 47-bit

MPX (without MAWA extension) cannot handle addresses above 47 bits, so we
need to make sure that MPX cannot be enabled if we already have a VMA above
the boundary and forbid creating such VMAs once MPX is enabled.

The patch implements mpx_unmapped_area_check() which is called from all
variants of get_unmapped_area() to check if the requested address fits
mpx.

On enabling MPX, we check if we already have any vma above 47-bit
boundary and forbit the enabling if we do.

As long as DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW is equal to TASK_SIZE_MAX, the change is
nop. It will change when we allow userspace to have mappings above
47-bits.
