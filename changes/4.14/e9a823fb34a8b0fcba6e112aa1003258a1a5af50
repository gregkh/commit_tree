block: fix warning when I/O elevator is changed as request_queue is being removed

There is a race between changing I/O elevator and request_queue removal
which can trigger the warning in kobject_add_internal.  A program can
use sysfs to request a change of elevator at the same time another task
is unregistering the request_queue the elevator would be attached to.
The elevator's kobject will then attempt to be connected to the
request_queue in the object tree when the request_queue has just been
removed from sysfs.  This triggers the warning in kobject_add_internal
as the request_queue no longer has a sysfs directory:

kobject_add_internal failed for iosched (error: -2 parent: queue)
------------[ cut here ]------------
WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 14075 at lib/kobject.c:244 kobject_add_internal+0x103/0x2d0

To fix this warning, we can check the QUEUE_FLAG_REGISTERED flag when
changing the elevator and use the request_queue's sysfs_lock to
serialize between clearing the flag and the elevator testing the flag.
