media: rc: mtk-cir: add platform data to adapt into various hardware

This patch is the preparation patch in order to adapt into various
hardware through adding platform data which holds specific characteristics
and differences among MediaTek supported CIR devices instead of the old
way defining those data in the static way as macro has. And the existing
logic would be slightly changed to operate on those data which the actual
device depends on.
