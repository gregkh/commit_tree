PCI: xilinx: Don't enable config completion interrupts

The Xilinx AXI bridge for PCI Express device provides interrupts indicating
the completion of config space accesses. We have previously
enabled/unmasked them but do nothing with them besides acknowledge them.

Leave the interrupts masked in order to avoid servicing a large number of
pointless interrupts during boot.
