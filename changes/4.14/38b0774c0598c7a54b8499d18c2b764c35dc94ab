nvmem: core: return EFBIG on out-of-range write

When writing data that exceeds the nvmem size to a nvmem sysfs file
using the sh redirection operator >, the shell hangs, trying to
write the out-of-range bytes endlessly.

Fix the problem by returning EFBIG described in man 2 write.

Similar change was done for binary sysfs files on commit
