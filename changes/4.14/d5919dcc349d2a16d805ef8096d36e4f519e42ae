Revert "PM / QoS: Fix device resume latency PM QoS"

This reverts commit 0cc2b4e5a020 (PM / QoS: Fix device resume latency PM
QoS) as it introduced regressions on multiple systems and the fix-up
in commit 2a9a86d5c813 (PM / QoS: Fix default runtime_pm device resume
latency) does not address all of them.

The original problem that commit 0cc2b4e5a020 was attempting to fix
will be addressed later.
