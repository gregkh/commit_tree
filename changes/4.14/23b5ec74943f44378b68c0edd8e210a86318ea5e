btrfs: fix readdir deadlock with pagefault

Readdir does dir_emit while under the btree lock.  dir_emit can trigger
the page fault which means we can deadlock.  Fix this by allocating a
buffer on opening a directory and copying the readdir into this buffer
and doing dir_emit from outside of the tree lock.

Thread A
readdir  <holding tree lock>
  dir_emit
    <page fault>
      down_read(mmap_sem)

Thread B
mmap write
  down_write(mmap_sem)
    page_mkwrite
      wait_ordered_extents

Process C
finish_ordered_extent
  insert_reserved_file_extent
   try to lock leaf <hang>
