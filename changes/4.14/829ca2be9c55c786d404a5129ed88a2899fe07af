MIPS: CPC: Use BIT/GENMASK for register fields, order & drop shifts

Tidy up asm/mips-cpc.h in a similar way to what "MIPS: CM: Use
BIT/GENMASK for register fields, order & drop shifts" did for
asm/mips-cm.h.

We use BIT() & GENMASK() to simplify the definition of register fields,
drop the _SHF definitions since that information can be found in the
_MSK ones, and then drop the _MSK suffix.

Fields definitions are moved to be next to the appropriate register
definition, making it easier to link the two & keep everything ordered
by register address. Comments are added including the name of each
register & a brief description of its purpose which helps to understand
what registers are for, link them back to hardware documentation or grep
for them.
