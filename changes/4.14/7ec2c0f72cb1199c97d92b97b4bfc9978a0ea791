media: platform: Add Amlogic Meson AO CEC Controller driver

The Amlogic SoC embeds a standalone CEC controller, this patch adds a driver
for such controller.
The controller does not need HPD to be active, and could support up to max
5 logical addresses, but only 1 is handled since the Suspend firmware can
make use of this unique logical address to wake up the device.

The Suspend firmware configuration will be added in an other patchset.
