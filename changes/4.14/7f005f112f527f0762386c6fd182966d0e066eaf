MIPS: generic: Fix compilation error from include asm/mips-cpc.h

Commit e83f7e02af50c ("MIPS: CPS: Have asm/mips-cps.h include CM & CPC
headers") adds a #error to arch/mips/include/asm/mips-cpc.h if it is
included directly. While this commit replaced almost all direct includes
of mips-cm.h and mips-cpc.h, 2 remain.

With some defconfigs, mips-cps.h is indirectly included before
mips-cpc.h, but in others this results in compilation errors:

In file included from arch/mips/generic/init.c:23:0:
./arch/mips/include/asm/mips-cpc.h:12:3: error: #error Please include
asm/mips-cps.h rather than asm/mips-cpc.h
 # error Please include asm/mips-cps.h rather than asm/mips-cpc.h

In file included from arch/mips/kernel/smp.c:23:0:
./arch/mips/include/asm/mips-cpc.h:12:3: error: #error Please include
asm/mips-cps.h rather than asm/mips-cpc.h
 # error Please include asm/mips-cps.h rather than asm/mips-cpc.h

In both cases, fix this by including mips-cps.h instead.
