x86/mm: fix use-after-free of vma during userfaultfd fault

Syzkaller with KASAN has reported a use-after-free of vma->vm_flags in
__do_page_fault() with the following reproducer:

  mmap(&(0x7f0000000000/0xfff000)=nil, 0xfff000, 0x3, 0x32, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0)
  mmap(&(0x7f0000011000/0x3000)=nil, 0x3000, 0x1, 0x32, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0)
  r0 = userfaultfd(0x0)
  ioctl$UFFDIO_API(r0, 0xc018aa3f, &(0x7f0000002000-0x18)={0xaa, 0x0, 0x0})
  ioctl$UFFDIO_REGISTER(r0, 0xc020aa00, &(0x7f0000019000)={{&(0x7f0000012000/0x2000)=nil, 0x2000}, 0x1, 0x0})
  r1 = gettid()
  syz_open_dev$evdev(&(0x7f0000013000-0x12)="2f6465762f696e7075742f6576656e742300", 0x0, 0x0)
  tkill(r1, 0x7)

The vma should be pinned by mmap_sem, but handle_userfault() might (in a
return to userspace scenario) release it and then acquire again, so when
we return to __do_page_fault() (with other result than VM_FAULT_RETRY),
the vma might be gone.

Specifically, per Andrea the scenario is
 "A return to userland to repeat the page fault later with a
  VM_FAULT_NOPAGE retval (potentially after handling any pending signal
  during the return to userland). The return to userland is identified
  whenever FAULT_FLAG_USER|FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE are both set in
  vmf->flags"

However, since commit a3c4fb7c9c2e ("x86/mm: Fix fault error path using
unsafe vma pointer") there is a vma_pkey() read of vma->vm_flags after
that point, which can thus become use-after-free.  Fix this by moving
the read before calling handle_mm_fault().
