clk: ux500: prcmu: constify clk_ops.

clk_ops are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with clk_ops provided by <linux/clk-provider.h> work
with const clk_ops. So mark the non-const clk_ops as const.

Here, Function "clk_reg_prcmu" is used to initialized clk_init_data.
clk_init_data is working with const clk_ops. So make clk_reg_prcmu
non-const clk_ops argument as const.
