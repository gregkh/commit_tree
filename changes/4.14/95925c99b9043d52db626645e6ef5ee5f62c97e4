lkdtm: Provide more complete coverage for REFCOUNT tests

The existing REFCOUNT_* LKDTM tests were designed only for testing a narrow
portion of CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL. This moves the tests to their own file and
expands their testing to poke each boundary condition.

Since the protections (CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL and x86-fast) use different
saturation values and reach-zero behavior, those have to be build-time
set so the tests can actually validate things are happening at the
right places.

Notably, the x86-fast protection will fail REFCOUNT_INC_ZERO and
REFCOUNT_ADD_ZERO since those conditions are not checked (only overflow
is critical to protecting refcount_t). CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL will warn for
each REFCOUNT_*_NEGATIVE test since it provides zero-pinning behaviors
(which allows it to pass REFCOUNT_INC_ZERO and REFCOUNT_ADD_ZERO).
