NFS: various changes relating to reporting IO errors.

1/ remove 'start' and 'end' args from nfs_file_fsync_commit().
   They aren't used.

2/ Make nfs_context_set_write_error() a "static inline" in internal.h
   so we can...

3/ Use nfs_context_set_write_error() instead of mapping_set_error()
   if nfs_pageio_add_request() fails before sending any request.
   NFS generally keeps errors in the open_context, not the mapping,
   so this is more consistent.

4/ If filemap_write_and_write_range() reports any error, still
   check ctx->error.  The value in ctx->error is likely to be
   more useful.  As part of this, NFS_CONTEXT_ERROR_WRITE is
   cleared slightly earlier, before nfs_file_fsync_commit() is called,
   rather than at the start of that function.
