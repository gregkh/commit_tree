power: supply: sbs-battery: correct capacity mode selection bits

The capacity mode bit is bit 15. Currently it is written as
default initialized enum and never shifted. This leads to
a behaviour where the BATTERY_MODE is not correctly
recognized and set again.

This commit initializes the enum accordingly.
