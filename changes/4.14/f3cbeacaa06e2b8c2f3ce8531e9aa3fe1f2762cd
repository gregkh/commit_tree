x86/intel_rdt/cqm: Add rmdir support

Resource groups (ctrl_mon and monitor groups) are represented by
directories in resctrl fs. Add support to remove the directories.

When a ctrl_mon directory is removed all the cpus and tasks are assigned
back to the root rdtgroup. When a monitor group is removed the cpus and
tasks are returned to the parent control group.
