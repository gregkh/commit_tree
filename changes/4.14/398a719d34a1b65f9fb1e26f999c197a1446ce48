powerpc/mm: Update bits used to skip hash_page

We test a number of bits from DSISR/SRR1 before deciding
to call hash_page(). If any of these is set, we go directly
to do_page_fault() as the bit indicate a fault that needs
to be handled there (no hashing needed).

This updates the current open-coded masks to use the new
DSISR definitions.

This *does* change the masks actually used in two ways:

 - We used to test various bits that were defined as "always 0"
in the architecture and could be repurposed for something
else. From now on, we just ignore such bits.

 - We were missing some new bits defined on P9
