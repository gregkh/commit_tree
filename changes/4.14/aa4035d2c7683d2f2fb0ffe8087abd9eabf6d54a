drm/syncobj: Add a reset ioctl (v3)

This just resets the dma_fence to NULL so it looks like it's never been
signaled.  This will be useful once we add the new wait API for allowing
wait on "submit and signal" behavior.

v2:
 - Take an array of sync objects (Dave Airlie)
v3:
 - Throw -EINVAL if pad != 0
