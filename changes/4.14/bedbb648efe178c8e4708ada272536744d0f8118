rcu: Add TPS() to event-traced strings

Strings used in event tracing need to be specially handled, for example,
using the TPS() macro.  Without the TPS() macro, although output looks
fine from within a running kernel, extracting traces from a crash dump
produces garbage instead of strings.  This commit therefore adds the TPS()
macro to some unadorned strings that were passed to event-tracing macros.
