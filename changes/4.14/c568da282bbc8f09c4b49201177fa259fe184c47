mm/vmalloc.c: halve the number of comparisons performed in pcpu_get_vm_areas()

In pcpu_get_vm_areas(), it checks each range is not overlapped.  To make
sure it is, only (N^2)/2 comparison is necessary, while current code
does N^2 times.  By starting from the next range, it achieves the goal
and the continue could be removed.

Also,

 - the overlap check of two ranges could be done with one clause

 - one typo in comment is fixed.
