i40evf: fix possible snprintf truncation of q_vector->name

The q_vector names are based on the interface name with a driver prefix,
the type of q_vector setup, and the queue number. We previously set the
size of this variable to IFNAMSIZ + 9, which is incorrect, because we
actually include a minimum of 14 characters extra beyond the interface
name size.

New versions of GCC since 7 include a new warning that detects this
possible truncation and complains. We can fix this by increasing the
size in case our interface name is too large to avoid truncation. We
don't need to go beyond 14 because the compiler is smart enough to
realize our values can never exceed size of 1. We do go up to 15 here
because possible future changes may increase the number of queues beyond
one digit.

While we are here, also change some variables to be unsigned (since they
are never negative) and stop using an extra unnecessary %s format
specifier.
