rtmutex: update rt-mutex-design

The rt-mutex-design documents didn't gotten meaningful update from its
first version. Even after owner's pending bit was removed in commit 8161239a8bcc
("rtmutex: Simplify PI algorithm and make highest prio task get lock")
and priority list 'plist' changed to rbtree. And Peter Zijlstra did some
clean up and fix for deadline task changes on tip tree.

So update it to latest code and make it meaningful.
Steven Rostedt and Sebastian Siewior gave much of comments and input
in this doc. Thanks!
