WARNING: Block comments should align the * on each line
WARNING: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
WARNING: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
WARNING: please, no space before tabs
WARNING: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
WARNING: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
WARNING: Missing a blank line after declarations
WARNING: struct of_device_id should normally be const
CHECK: Please don't use multiple blank lines
CHECK: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis
CHECK: 'Endianess' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Endianness'?
CHECK: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
ERROR: that open brace { should be on the previous line
