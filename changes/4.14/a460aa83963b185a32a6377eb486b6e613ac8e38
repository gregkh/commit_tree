ipv6: fib: Add helpers to hold / drop a reference on rt6_info

Similar to commit 1c677b3d2828 ("ipv4: fib: Add fib_info_hold() helper")
and commit b423cb10807b ("ipv4: fib: Export free_fib_info()") add an
helper to hold a reference on rt6_info and export rt6_release() to drop
it and potentially release the route.

This is needed so that drivers capable of FIB offload could hold a
reference on the route before queueing it for offload and drop it after
the route has been programmed to the device's tables.
