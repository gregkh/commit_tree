netvsc: optimize receive completions

Optimize how receive completion ring are managed.
   * Allocate only as many slots as needed for all buffers from host
   * Allocate before setting up sub channel for better error detection
   * Don't need to keep copy of initial receive section message
   * Precompute the watermark for when receive flushing is needed
   * Replace division with conditional test
   * Replace atomic per-device variable with per-channel check.
   * Handle corner case where receive completion send
     fails if ring buffer to host is full.
