powerpc/configs: Update for CONFIG_NF_CT_PROTO_(SCTP|UDPLITE)=y

In commit a85406afeb3e ("netfilter: conntrack: built-in support for
SCTP"), NF_CT_PROTO_SCTP switched from tristate to bool and became
default y. Similarly in commit 9b91c96c5d1f ("netfilter: conntrack:
built-in support for UDPlite"), NF_CT_PROTO_UDPLITE switched from
tristate to bool and became default y.

We had a few configs which set them to =m, which is no longer valid.
We don't need to change them to =y because both symbols are default y
and are enabled automatically based on the other symbols in the
affected defconfigs.
