MIPS: microMIPS: Fix decoding of swsp16 instruction

When the immediate encoded in the instruction is accessed, it is sign
extended due to being a signed value being assigned to a signed integer.
The ISA specifies that this operation is an unsigned operation.
The sign extension leads us to incorrectly decode:

801e9c8e:       cbf1            sw      ra,68(sp)

As having an immediate of 1073741809.

Since the instruction format does not specify signed/unsigned, and this
is currently the only location to use this instuction format, change it
to an unsigned immediate.
