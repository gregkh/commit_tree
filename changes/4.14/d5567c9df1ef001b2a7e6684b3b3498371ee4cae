z3fold: fix potential race in z3fold_reclaim_page

It is possible that on a (partially) unsuccessful page reclaim,
kref_put() called in z3fold_reclaim_page() does not yield page release,
but the page is released shortly afterwards by another thread.  Then
z3fold_reclaim_page() would try to list_add() that (released) page again
which is obviously a bug.

To avoid that, spin_lock() has to be taken earlier, before the
kref_put() call mentioned earlier.
