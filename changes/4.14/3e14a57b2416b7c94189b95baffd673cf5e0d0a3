memcg, THP, swap: support move mem cgroup charge for THP swapped out

PTE mapped THP (Transparent Huge Page) will be ignored when moving
memory cgroup charge.  But for THP which is in the swap cache, the
memory cgroup charge for the swap of a tail-page may be moved in current
implementation.  That isn't correct, because the swap charge for all
sub-pages of a THP should be moved together.  Following the processing
of the PTE mapped THP, the mem cgroup charge moving for the swap entry
for a tail-page of a THP is ignored too.
