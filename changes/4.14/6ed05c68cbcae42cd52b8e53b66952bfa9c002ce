usb: musb: sunxi: Explicitly release USB PHY on exit

This fixes a kernel oops when unloading the driver due to usb_put_phy
being called after usb_phy_generic_unregister when the device is
detached. Calling usb_phy_generic_unregister causes x->dev->driver to
be NULL in usb_put_phy and results in a NULL pointer dereference.
