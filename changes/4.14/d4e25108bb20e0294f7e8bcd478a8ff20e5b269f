staging: wilc1000: Neaten refresh_scan - remove always 1 argument

All uses of refresh_scan() have a constant 1 as the second argument.
Remove it and neaten the function declaration.

Miscellanea:

o Remove overly deep indentation by using continue;
o Remove unnecessary test of the address of a static array as it's
  always non-zero
o Rename and use proper type for the first void * argument as it's
  always the struct wilc_priv *
o Move variables into loop where used
