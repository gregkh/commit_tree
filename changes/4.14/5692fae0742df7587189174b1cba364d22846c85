fpga manager: Add altera-ps-spi driver for Altera FPGAs

altera-ps-spi loads FPGA firmware over SPI, using the "passive serial"
interface on Altera Arria 10, Cyclone V or Stratix V FPGAs.

This is one of the simpler ways to set up an FPGA at runtime.
The signal interface is close to unidirectional SPI with lsb first.
