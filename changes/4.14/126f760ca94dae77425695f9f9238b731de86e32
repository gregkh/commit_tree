rds: Fix incorrect statistics counting

In rds_send_xmit() there is logic to batch the sends. However, if
another thread has acquired the lock and has incremented the send_gen,
it is considered a race and we yield. The code incrementing the
s_send_lock_queue_raced statistics counter did not count this event
correctly.

This commit counts the race condition correctly.

Changes from v1:
- Removed check for *someone_on_xmit()*
- Fixed incorrect indentation
