powerpc/xive: introduce H_INT_ESB hcall

The H_INT_ESB hcall() is used to issue a load or store to the ESB page
instead of using the MMIO pages. This can be used as a workaround on
some HW issues. The OS knows that this hcall should be used on an
interrupt source when the ESB hcall flag is set to 1 in the hcall
H_INT_GET_SOURCE_INFO.

To maintain the frontier between the xive frontend and backend, we
introduce a new xive operation 'esb_rw' to be used in the routines
doing memory accesses on the ESBs.
