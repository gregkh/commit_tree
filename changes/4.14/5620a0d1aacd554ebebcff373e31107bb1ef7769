firmware: delete in-kernel firmware

The last firmware change for the in-kernel firmware source code was back
in 2013.  Everyone has been relying on the out-of-tree linux-firmware
package for a long long time.

So let's drop it, it's baggage we don't need to keep dragging around
(and having to fix random kbuild issues over time...)
