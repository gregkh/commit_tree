IB/mlx5: Allow posting multi packet send WQEs if hardware supports

Set the field to allow posting multi packet send WQEs if hardware
supports this feature. This doesn't mean the send WQEs will be for
multi packet unless the send WQE was prepared according to multi
packet send WQE format.

User space shall use flag MLX5_IB_ALLOW_MPW to check if hardware
supports MPW and allows MPW in SQ context.
