apparmor: fix apparmorfs DAC access permissions

The DAC access permissions for several apparmorfs files are wrong.

.access - needs to be writable by all tasks to perform queries
the others in the set only provide a read fn so should be read only.

With policy namespace virtualization all apparmor needs to control
the permission and visibility checks directly which means DAC
access has to be allowed for all user, group, and other.
