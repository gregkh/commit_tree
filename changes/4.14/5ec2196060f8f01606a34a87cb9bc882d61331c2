scsi: zfcp: clean up a member of struct zfcp_qdio that was assigned but never used

v2.6.38 commit a54ca0f62f95 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing
for HBA records.")
dropped trace information previously introduced with
v2.6.27 commit c3baa9a26c5a ("[SCSI] zfcp: Add information about interrupt
to trace.")
but kept and needlessly assigned a now no longer used struct field.
