serial: earlycon: Only try fdt when specify 'earlycon' exactly

When moving earlycon early_param handling to serial, the devicetree
earlycons enable condition changed slightly.

We used to only do that for 'console'/'earlycon', but now would also
for 'console='/'earlycon='.

Fix it by using the same condition like before.
