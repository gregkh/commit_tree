mm: implement find_get_pages_range()

Implement a variant of find_get_pages() that stops iterating at given
index.  This may be substantial performance gain if the mapping is
sparse.  See following commit for details.  Furthermore lots of users of
this function (through pagevec_lookup()) actually want a range lookup
and all of them are currently open-coding this.

Also create corresponding pagevec_lookup_range() function.
