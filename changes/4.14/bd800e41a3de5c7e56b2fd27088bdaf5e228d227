iwlwifi: mvm: change state when queueing agg start work

Add a new state to enum iwl_mvm_agg_state, which is used between
queueing the work that starts tx aggregations and actually starting that
work (changing to state IWL_AGG_STARTING).
This solves a race where ieee80211_start_tx_ba_session is called a
second time, before the work queued by the first run has a chance to
change the agg_state. In this case the second call to
ieee80211_start_tx_ba_session returns an error, and the fallback is to
abort the ba session start.
