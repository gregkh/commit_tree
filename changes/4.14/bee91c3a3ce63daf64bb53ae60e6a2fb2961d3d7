ARCv2: IOC: Tighten up the contraints (specifically base / size alignment)

	[Needed for HSDK]

 - Currently IOC base is hardcoded to 0x8000_0000 which is default value
   of LINUX_LINK_BASE, but may not always be the case

 - IOC programming model imposes the constraint that IOC aperture size
   needs to be aligned to IOC base address, which we were not checking
   so far.
