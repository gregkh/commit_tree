mtd: nand: qcom: support for NAND controller properties

Currently driver data is being assigned directly with ECC modes.
Now, the plan is to add more NAND controller versions which will
have different properties. This patch reorganizes the current driver
data assignment by creating NAND controller properties structure
which will contain all properties specific to NAND controller.
