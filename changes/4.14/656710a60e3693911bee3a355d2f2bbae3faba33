userfaultfd: non-cooperative: closing the uffd without triggering SIGBUS

This is an enhancement to avoid a non cooperative userfaultfd manager
having to unregister all regions before it can close the uffd after all
userfaultfd activity completed.

The UFFDIO_UNREGISTER would serialize against the handle_userfault by
taking the mmap_sem for writing, but we can simply repeat the page fault
if we detect the uffd was closed and so the regular page fault paths
should takeover.
