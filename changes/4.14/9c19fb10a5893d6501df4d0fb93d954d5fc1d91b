drm/syncobj: Add a callback mechanism for replace_fence (v3)

It is useful in certain circumstances to know when the fence is replaced
in a syncobj.  Specifically, it may be useful to know when the fence
goes from NULL to something valid.  This does make syncobj_replace_fence
a little more expensive because it has to take a lock but, in the common
case where there is no callback list, it spends a very short amount of
time inside the lock.

v2:
 - Don't lock in drm_syncobj_fence_get.  We only really need to lock
   around fence_replace to make the callback work.
v3:
 - Fix the cb_list comment to make kbuild happy
