fs/proc: Report eip/esp in /prod/PID/stat for coredumping

Commit 0a1eb2d474ed ("fs/proc: Stop reporting eip and esp in
/proc/PID/stat") stopped reporting eip/esp because it is
racy and dangerous for executing tasks. The comment adds:

    As far as I know, there are no use programs that make any
    material use of these fields, so just get rid of them.

However, existing userspace core-dump-handler applications (for
example, minicoredumper) are using these fields since they
provide an excellent cross-platform interface to these valuable
pointers. So that commit introduced a user space visible
regression.

Partially revert the change and make the readout possible for
tasks with the proper permissions and only if the target task
has the PF_DUMPCORE flag set.
