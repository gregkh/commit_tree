crypto: drbg - fix freeing of resources

During the change to use aligned buffers, the deallocation code path was
not updated correctly. The current code tries to free the aligned buffer
pointer and not the original buffer pointer as it is supposed to.

Thus, the code is updated to free the original buffer pointer and set
the aligned buffer pointer that is used throughout the code to NULL.
