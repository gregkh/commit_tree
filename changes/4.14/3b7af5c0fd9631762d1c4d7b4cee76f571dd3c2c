powerpc: Fix action argument for cpufeatures-based TLB flush

Commit 41d0c2ecde19 ("powerpc/powernv: Fix local TLB flush for boot
and MCE on POWER9") introduced calls to __flush_tlb_power[89] from the
cpufeatures code, specifying the number of sets to flush.

However, these functions take an action argument, not a number of
sets. This means we hit the BUG() in __flush_tlb_{206,300} when using
cpufeatures-style configuration.

This change passes TLB_INVAL_SCOPE_GLOBAL instead.
