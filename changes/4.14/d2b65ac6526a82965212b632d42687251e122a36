powerpc: Emulate load/store floating point as integer word instructions

This adds emulation for the lfiwax, lfiwzx and stfiwx instructions.
This necessitated adding a new flag to indicate whether a floating
point or an integer conversion was needed for LOAD_FP and STORE_FP,
so this moves the size field in op->type up 4 bits.
