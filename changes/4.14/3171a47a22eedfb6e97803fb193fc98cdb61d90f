irqchip/gic-v3-its: Add VPE affinity changes

When we're about to run a vcpu, it is crucial that the redistributor
associated with the physical CPU is being told about the new residency.

This is abstracted by hijacking the irq_set_affinity method for the
doorbell interrupt associated with the VPE. It is expected that the
hypervisor will call this method before scheduling the VPE.
