futex: Fix pi_state->owner serialization

There was a reported suspicion about a race between exit_pi_state_list()
and put_pi_state(). The same report mentioned the comment with
put_pi_state() said it should be called with hb->lock held, and it no
longer is in all places.

As it turns out, the pi_state->owner serialization is indeed broken. As per
the new rules:

  734009e96d19 ("futex: Change locking rules")

pi_state->owner should be serialized by pi_state->pi_mutex.wait_lock.
For the sites setting pi_state->owner we already hold wait_lock (where
required) but exit_pi_state_list() and put_pi_state() were not and
raced on clearing it.
