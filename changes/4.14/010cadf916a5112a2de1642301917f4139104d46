mlxsw: spectrum_router: Support FID-less RIFs

Loopback RIFs, which will be introduced in a follow-up patch, differ
from other RIFs in that they do not have a FID associated with them.

To support this, demote FID allocation from mlxsw_sp_rif_create to
configure op of the existing RIF types, and likewise the FID release
from mlxsw_sp_rif_destroy to deconfigure op.
