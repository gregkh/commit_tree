drm/nouveau/kms/nv50: perform null check on msto[i] rathern than msto

The null check on the array msto is incorrect since msto is never
null. The null check should be instead on msto[i] since this is
being dereferenced in the call to drm_mode_connector_attach_encoder.

Thanks to Emil Velikov for pointing out the mistake in my original
fix and for suggesting the correct fix.
