MIPS: math-emu: Correct user fault_addr type

The fault_addr argument to fpu_emulator_cop1Handler(), fpux_emu() and
cop1Emulate() has up until now been declared as:

  void *__user *fault_addr

This is essentially a pointer in user memory which points to a pointer
to void. This is not the intent for our code, which is actually
operating on a pointer to a pointer to void where the pointer to void is
pointing at user memory. ie. the pointer is in kernel memory & points to
user memory.

This mismatch produces a lot of sparse warnings that look like this:

arch/mips/math-emu/cp1emu.c:1485:45:
   warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
      expected void *[noderef] <asn:1><noident>
      got unsigned int [noderef] [usertype] <asn:1>*[assigned] va

Fix these by modifying the declaration of the fault_addr argument to:

  void __user **fault_addr
