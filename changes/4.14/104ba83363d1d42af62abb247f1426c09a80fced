igb: Fix TX map failure path

When the driver cannot map a TX buffer, instead of rolling back
gracefully and retrying later, we currently get a panic:

[  159.885994] igb 0000:00:00.0: TX DMA map failed
[  159.886588] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff00000a08c7a8
               ...
[  159.897031] PC is at igb_xmit_frame_ring+0x9c8/0xcb8

Fix the erroneous test that leads to this situation.
