quota: Fix possible corruption of dqi_flags

dqi_flags modifications are protected by dq_data_lock. However the
modifications in vfs_load_quota_inode() and in mark_info_dirty() were
not which could lead to corruption of dqi_flags. Since modifications to
dqi_flags are rare, this is hard to observe in practice but in theory it
could happen. Fix the problem by always using dq_data_lock for
protection.
