fq_impl: Properly enforce memory limit

The fq structure would fail to properly enforce the memory limit in the case
where the packet being enqueued was bigger than the packet being removed to
bring the memory usage down. So keep dropping packets until the memory usage is
back below the limit. Also, fix the statistics for memory limit violations.
