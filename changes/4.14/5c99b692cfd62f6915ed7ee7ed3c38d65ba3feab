x86/unwind: Use MSB for frame pointer encoding on 32-bit

On x86-32, Tetsuo Handa and Fengguang Wu reported unwinder warnings
like:

  WARNING: kernel stack regs at f60bb9c8 in swapper:1 has bad 'bp' value 0ba00000

And also there were some stack dumps with a bunch of unreliable '?'
symbols after an apic_timer_interrupt symbol, meaning the unwinder got
confused when it tried to read the regs.

The cause of those issues is that, with GCC 4.8 (and possibly older),
there are cases where GCC misaligns the stack pointer in a leaf function
for no apparent reason:

  c124a388 <acpi_rs_move_data>:
  c124a388:       55                      push   %ebp
  c124a389:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
  c124a38b:       57                      push   %edi
  c124a38c:       56                      push   %esi
  c124a38d:       89 d6                   mov    %edx,%esi
  c124a38f:       53                      push   %ebx
  c124a390:       31 db                   xor    %ebx,%ebx
  c124a392:       83 ec 03                sub    $0x3,%esp
  ...
  c124a3e3:       83 c4 03                add    $0x3,%esp
  c124a3e6:       5b                      pop    %ebx
  c124a3e7:       5e                      pop    %esi
  c124a3e8:       5f                      pop    %edi
  c124a3e9:       5d                      pop    %ebp
  c124a3ea:       c3                      ret

If an interrupt occurs in such a function, the regs on the stack will be
unaligned, which breaks the frame pointer encoding assumption.  So on
32-bit, use the MSB instead of the LSB to encode the regs.

This isn't an issue on 64-bit, because interrupts align the stack before
writing to it.
