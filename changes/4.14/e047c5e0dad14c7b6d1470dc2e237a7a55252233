media: coda: reduce iram size to leave space for suspend to ram

The on-chip SRAM of i.MX6S is only 128 KiB. 4 KiB of that are allocated
for suspend to RAM since commit df595746fa69 ("ARM: imx: add suspend in
ocram support for i.mx6q"). Reduce the requested IRAM size to 124 KiB to
avoid an allocation failure that causes the coda driver to not use the
SRAM at all.
