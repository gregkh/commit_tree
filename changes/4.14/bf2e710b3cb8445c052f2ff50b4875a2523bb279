perf maps: Lookup maps in both intitial mountns and inner mountns.

If a process is in a mountns and has symbols in /tmp/perf-<pid>.map,
look first in the namespace using the tgid for the pidns that the
process might be in.  If the map isn't found there, try looking in the
mountns where perf is running, and use the tgid that's appropriate for
perf's pid namespace.  If all else fails, use the original pid.

This allows us to locate a symbol map file in the mount namespace, if it
was generated there.  However, we also try the tool's /tmp in case it's
there instead.
