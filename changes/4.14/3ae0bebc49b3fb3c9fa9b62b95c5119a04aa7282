ceph: queue cap snap only when snap realm's context changes

If we create capsnap when snap realm's context does not change, the
new capsnap's snapc is equal to ci->i_head_snapc. Page writeback code
can't differentiates dirty pages associated with the new capsnap from
dirty pages associated with i_head_snapc.
