drm/fb-helper: Drop locking from the vsync wait ioctl code

Like with the drm-native vblank wait ioctl we can entirely rely on the
spinlocks in drm_vblank.c, no need at all to take expensive mutexes.
The only reason we had to take mode_config.mutex was to protect the
fbdev helper's data-structures, but that's now done by
fb_helper->lock.
