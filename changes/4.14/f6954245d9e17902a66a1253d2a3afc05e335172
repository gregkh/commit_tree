btrfs: remove ref_tree implementation from backref.c

Commit afce772e87c3 ("btrfs: fix check_shared for fiemap ioctl") added
the ref_tree code in backref.c to reduce backref searching for
shared extents under the FIEMAP ioctl. This code will not be
compatible with the upcoming rbtree changes for improved backref
searching, so this patch removes the ref_tree code.  The rbtree
changes will provide the equivalent functionality for FIEMAP.

The above commit also introduced transaction semantics around calls to
btrfs_check_shared() in order to accurately account for delayed refs.
This functionality needs to be retained, so a complete revert of the
above commit is not desirable. This patch therefore removes the
ref_tree portion of the commit as above, however it does not remove
the transaction portion.
