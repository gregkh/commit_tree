bpf/verifier: rework value tracking

Unifies adjusted and unadjusted register value types (e.g. FRAME_POINTER is
 now just a PTR_TO_STACK with zero offset).
Tracks value alignment by means of tracking known & unknown bits.  This
 also replaces the 'reg->imm' (leading zero bits) calculations for (what
 were) UNKNOWN_VALUEs.
If pointer leaks are allowed, and adjust_ptr_min_max_vals returns -EACCES,
 treat the pointer as an unknown scalar and try again, because we might be
 able to conclude something about the result (e.g. pointer & 0x40 is either
 0 or 0x40).
Verifier hooks in the netronome/nfp driver were changed to match the new
 data structures.
