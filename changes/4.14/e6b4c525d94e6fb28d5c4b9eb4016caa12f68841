ALSA: pcm: Correct broken procfs set up

The commit c8da9be4a75f ("ALSA: pcm: Adjust nine function calls
together with a variable assignment") contained a badly incorrect
conversion, a "status" PCM procfs creation was replaced with the next
one.  Luckily, this could be spotted easily by the kernel runtime
warning.
