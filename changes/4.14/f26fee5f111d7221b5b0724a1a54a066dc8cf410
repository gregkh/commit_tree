ARM: 8690/1: lpae: build TTB control register value from scratch in v7_ttb_setup

Reading TTBCR in early boot stage might return the value of the previous
kernel's configuration, especially in case of kexec. For example, if
normal kernel (first kernel) had run on a configuration of PHYS_OFFSET <=
PAGE_OFFSET and crash kernel (second kernel) is running on a configuration
PHYS_OFFSET > PAGE_OFFSET, which can happen because it depends on the
reserved area for crash kernel, reading TTBCR and using the value to OR
other bit fields might be risky because it doesn't have a reset value for TTBCR.
