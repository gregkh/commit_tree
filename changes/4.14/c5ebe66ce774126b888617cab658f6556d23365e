rcu: Add event tracing to ->gp_tasks update at GP start

There is currently event tracing to track when a task is preempted
within a preemptible RCU read-side critical section, and also when that
task subsequently reaches its outermost rcu_read_unlock(), but none
indicating when a new grace period starts when that grace period must
wait on pre-existing readers that have been been preempted at least once
since the beginning of their current RCU read-side critical sections.

This commit therefore adds an event trace at grace-period start in
the case where there are such readers.  Note that only the first
reader in the list is traced.
