f2fs: fix to wake up all sleeping flusher

In scenario of remount_ro vs flush, after flush_thread exits in
->remount_fs, flusher will only clean up golbal issue_list, but
without waking up flushers waiting on that list, result in hang
related user threads.

In order to fix this issue, this patch enables the flusher to
take charge of issue_flush thread: executes merged flush command,
and wake up all sleeping flushers.
