netfilter: constify nf_conntrack_l3/4proto parameters

When a nf_conntrack_l3/4proto parameter is not on the left hand side
of an assignment, its address is not taken, and it is not passed to a
function that may modify its fields, then it can be declared as const.

This change is useful from a documentation point of view, and can
possibly facilitate making some nf_conntrack_l3/4proto structures const
subsequently.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
