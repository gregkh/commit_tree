smp/hotplug: Differentiate the AP completion between up and down

With lockdep-crossrelease we get deadlock reports that span cpu-up and
cpu-down chains. Such deadlocks cannot possibly happen because cpu-up
and cpu-down are globally serialized.

  takedown_cpu()
    irq_lock_sparse()
    wait_for_completion(&st->done)

                                cpuhp_thread_fun
                                  cpuhp_up_callback
                                    cpuhp_invoke_callback
                                      irq_affinity_online_cpu
                                        irq_local_spare()
                                        irq_unlock_sparse()
                                  complete(&st->done)

Now that we have consistent AP state, we can trivially separate the
AP completion between up and down using st->bringup.
