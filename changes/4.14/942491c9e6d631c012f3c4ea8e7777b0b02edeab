xfs: fix AIM7 regression

Apparently our current rwsem code doesn't like doing the trylock, then
lock for real scheme.  So change our read/write methods to just do the
trylock for the RWF_NOWAIT case.  This fixes a ~25% regression in
AIM7.

Fixes: 91f9943e ("fs: support RWF_NOWAIT for buffered reads")
