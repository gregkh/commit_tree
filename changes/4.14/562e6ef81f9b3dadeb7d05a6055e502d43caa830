Introduce 8250_men_mcb

This patch introduces the 8250_men_mcb driver for the MEN 16Z125
IP-Core. This is a 16550-type UART with a 60 byte FIFO.
Due to strange old hardware, every board using this IP core requires
different values for uartclk. A reasonable default is included in
addition to the support of three boards. Additional values for other
boards will be added later.

This v2 has some whitespace fixes, I screwed this up yesterday.
