net: qcom/emac: specify the correct size when mapping a DMA buffer

When mapping the RX DMA buffers, the driver was accidentally specifying
zero for the buffer length.  Under normal circumstances, SWIOTLB does not
need to allocate a bounce buffer, so the address is just mapped without
checking the size field.  This is why the error was not detected earlier.
