arm64: Abstract syscallno manipulation

The -1 "no syscall" value is written in various ways, shared with
the user ABI in some places, and generally obscure.

This patch attempts to make things a little more consistent and
readable by replacing all these uses with a single #define.  A
couple of symbolic helpers are provided to clarify the intent
further.

Because the in-syscall check in do_signal() is changed from >= 0 to
!= NO_SYSCALL by this patch, different behaviour may be observable
if syscallno is set to values less than -1 by a tracer.  However,
this is not different from the behaviour that is already observable
if a tracer sets syscallno to a value >= __NR_(compat_)syscalls.

It appears that this can cause spurious syscall restarting, but
that is not a new behaviour either, and does not appear harmful.
