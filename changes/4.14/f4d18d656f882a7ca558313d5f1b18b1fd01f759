crypto: ccp - Abstract interrupt registeration

The CCP and PSP devices part of AMD Secure Procesor may share the same
interrupt. Hence we expand the SP device to register a common interrupt
handler and provide functions to CCP and PSP devices to register their
interrupt callback which will be invoked upon interrupt.
