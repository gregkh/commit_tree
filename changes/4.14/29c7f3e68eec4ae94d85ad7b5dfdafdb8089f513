usb: renesas_usbhs: Fix DMAC sequence for receiving zero-length packet

The DREQE bit of the DnFIFOSEL should be set to 1 after the DE bit of
USB-DMAC on R-Car SoCs is set to 1 after the USB-DMAC received a
zero-length packet. Otherwise, a transfer completion interruption
of USB-DMAC doesn't happen. Even if the driver changes the sequence,
normal operations (transmit/receive without zero-length packet) will
not cause any side-effects. So, this patch fixes the sequence anyway.
