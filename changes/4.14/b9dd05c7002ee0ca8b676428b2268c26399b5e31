ARM: 8720/1: ensure dump_instr() checks addr_limit

When CONFIG_DEBUG_USER is enabled, it's possible for a user to
deliberately trigger dump_instr() with a chosen kernel address.

Let's avoid problems resulting from this by using get_user() rather than
__get_user(), ensuring that we don't erroneously access kernel memory.

So that we can use the same code to dump user instructions and kernel
instructions, the common dumping code is factored out to __dump_instr(),
with the fs manipulated appropriately in dump_instr() around calls to
this.
