ARM: align .data section

Robert Jarzmik reports that his PXA25x system fails to boot with 4.12,
failing at __flush_whole_cache in arch/arm/mm/proc-xscale.S:215:

   0xc0019e20 <+0>:     ldr     r1, [pc, #788]
   0xc0019e24 <+4>:     ldr     r0, [r1]	<== here

with r1 containing 0xc06f82cd, which is the address of "clean_addr".
Examination of the System.map shows:

c06f22c8 D user_pmd_table
c06f22cc d __warned.19178
c06f22cd d clean_addr

indicating that a .data.unlikely section has appeared just before the
.data section from proc-xscale.S.  According to objdump -h, it appears
that our assembly files default their .data alignment to 2**0, which
is bad news if the preceding .data section size is not power-of-2
aligned at link time.

Add the appropriate .align directives to all assembly files in arch/arm
that are missing them where we require an appropriate alignment.
