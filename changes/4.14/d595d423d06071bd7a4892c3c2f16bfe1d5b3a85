MIPS: SMP: Allow boot_secondary SMP op to return errors

Allow the boot_secondary SMP op to return an error to __cpu_up(), which
will in turn return it to its caller.

This will allow SMP implementations to return errors quickly in cases
they they know have failed, rather than relying upon __cpu_up()
eventually timing out waiting for the cpu_running completion.
