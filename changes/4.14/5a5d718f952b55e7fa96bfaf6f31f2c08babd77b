ALSA: hda - program ICT bits to support HBR audio

On recent Intel platforms (Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, ApolloLake,
KabyLake, ...), the IEC Coding Type (ICT) bitfield in the Digital
Converter Control #3 needs to be set explicitly for HDMI/DisplayPort
High Bit Rate (HBR) audio playback to work. This was not required in
earlier platforms when HBR was first introduced. The ICT bits are
defined in Section 7.3.3.9 of the HDaudio 1.0a specification.

Since the ICT bitfield was not specified for HDAudio 1.0 devices
(before 2009), we only program it on machines more recent than
Haswell.

We tested that this fix is not needed on Baytrail-I (MinnowBoard
Turbot) and believe by extension it also does not apply to Braswell.
