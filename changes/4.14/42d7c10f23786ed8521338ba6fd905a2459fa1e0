scsi: qedi: Limit number for CQ queues.

[qed_sp_iscsi_func_start:189(host_7-0)]Cannot satisfy CQ amount. Queues
requested 8, CQs available 4. Aborting function start

Above condition will resolve as management firmware is capable of
telling us the number of CQs available for a given PF, qed will
communicate the same number to qedi, So that qedi will know how much CQs
are allowed.
