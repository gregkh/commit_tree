xfs: Don't log uninitialised fields in inode structures

Prevent kmemcheck from throwing warnings about reading uninitialised
memory when formatting inodes into the incore log buffer. There are
several issues here - we don't always log all the fields in the
inode log format item, and we never log the inode the
di_next_unlinked field.

In the case of the inode log format item, this is exacerbated
by the old xfs_inode_log_format structure padding issue. Hence make
the padded, 64 bit aligned version of the structure the one we always
use for formatting the log and get rid of the 64 bit variant. This
means we'll always log the 64-bit version and so recovery only needs
to convert from the unpadded 32 bit version from older 32 bit
kernels.
