serial: core: enforce type for upf_t when copying

upf_t is a bitwise defined type and any assignment from different, but
compatible, types makes static analyzer unhappy.

drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:793:29: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:793:29:    expected int [signed] flags
drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:793:29:    got restricted upf_t [usertype] flags
drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:867:19: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:867:19:    expected restricted upf_t [usertype] new_flags
drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:867:19:    got int [signed] flags

Enforce corresponding types when upf_t being assigned.

Note, we need __force attribute due to the scope of variable. It's being
used in user space with plain old type while kernel uses bitwise one.
