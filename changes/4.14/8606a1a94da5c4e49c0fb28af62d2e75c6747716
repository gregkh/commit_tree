mm: kvfree the swap cluster info if the swap file is unsatisfactory

If initializing a small swap file fails because the swap file has a
problem (holes, etc.) then we need to free the cluster info as part of
cleanup.  Unfortunately a previous patch changed the code to use kvzalloc
but did not change all the vfree calls to use kvfree.

Found by running generic/357 from xfstests.
