dma-buf/sw-sync: Fix locking around sync_timeline lists

The sync_pt were not adding themselves atomically to the timeline lists,
corruption imminent.  Only a single list is required to track the
unsignaled sync_pt, so reduce it and rename the lock more appropriately
along with using idiomatic names to distinguish a list from links along
it.

v2: Prevent spinlock recursion on free during create (next patch) and
fixup crossref in kerneldoc
