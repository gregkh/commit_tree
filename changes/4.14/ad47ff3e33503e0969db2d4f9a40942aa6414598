powerpc/sstep: Fix issues with set_cr0()

set_cr0() broke when we changed analyse_instr() to not modify the
register state. Instead of looking at regs->gpr[x] which has not
been updated yet, we need to look at op->val.

Fixes: 3cdfcbfd32b9 ("powerpc: Change analyse_instr so it doesn't modify *regs")
