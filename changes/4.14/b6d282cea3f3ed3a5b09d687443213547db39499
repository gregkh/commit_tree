binder: refactor binder_pop_transaction

binder_pop_transaction needs to be split into 2 pieces to
to allow the proc lock to be held on entry to dequeue the
transaction stack, but no lock when kfree'ing the transaction.

Split into binder_pop_transaction_locked and binder_free_transaction
(the actual locks are still to be added).
