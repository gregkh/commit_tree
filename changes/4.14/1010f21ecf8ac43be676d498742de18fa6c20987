scsi: qla2xxx: Initialize Work element before requesting IRQs

commit a9e170e28636 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix uninitialized work element")
moved initializiation of work element earlier in the probe to fix call
stack. However, it still leaves a window where interrupt can be
generated before work element is initialized. Fix that window by
initializing work element before we are requesting IRQs.

[mkp: fixed typos]
