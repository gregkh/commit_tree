scsi: lpfc: Fix duplicate NVME rport entries and namespaces.

After lip, the driver sometimes would have two rports for the same
device, allowing the namespaces to be duplicated by nvme.

In lpfc_plogi_confirm_nport() the driver was not swapping the nrport
maintained by the ndlp's undergoing address swapping. This allowed the
2nd rport to sneak in as it was considered a separate device.

This patch adds the fixes to Swap the nrport in each ndlp and take care
of the reference counts on the ndlps similar to FCP rports.
