net: phy: Fix truncation of large IRQ numbers in phy_attached_print()

Given NR_IRQS is 2048 on sparc64, and even 32784 on alpha, 3 digits is
not enough to represent interrupt numbers on all architectures.  Hence
PHY interrupt numbers may be truncated during printing.

Increase the buffer size from 4 to 8 bytes to fix this.
