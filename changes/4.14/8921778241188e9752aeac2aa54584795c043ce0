pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7796: Fix to delete FSCLKST pin and IPSR7 bit[15:12] register definitions

This patch fixes the macro definitions of FSCLKST pins function and IPSR7
bit[15:12] register deleted.

This is a correction because IPSR register specification for R8A7796 SoC
was changed in R-Car Gen3 Hardware User's Manual Rev.0.53E or later.
