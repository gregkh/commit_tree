xdp: Add batching support to redirect map

For performance reasons we want to avoid updating the tail pointer in
the driver tx ring as much as possible. To accomplish this we add
batching support to the redirect path in XDP.

This adds another ndo op "xdp_flush" that is used to inform the driver
that it should bump the tail pointer on the TX ring.
