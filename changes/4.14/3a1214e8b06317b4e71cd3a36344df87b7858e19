flow_dissector: Cleanup control flow

__skb_flow_dissect is riddled with gotos that make discerning the flow,
debugging, and extending the capability difficult. This patch
reorganizes things so that we only perform goto's after the two main
switch statements (no gotos within the cases now). It also eliminates
several goto labels so that there are only two labels that can be target
for goto.
