staging: typec: tcpm: Set default state after error recovery based on port type

While exiting ERROR_RECOVERY, choose default state based on the port
type instead of current power role.

Quoting from specification:

4.5.2.2.2 ErrorRecovery State
This state appears in Figure 4-12, Figure 4-13, Figure 4-14, Figure 4-15,
Figure 4-16 and Figure 4-17.
The ErrorRecovery state is where the port removes the terminations from
the CC1 and CC2 pins for tErrorRecovery followed by transitioning to the
appropriate Unattached.SNK or Unattached.SRC state based on port type.
This is the equivalent of forcing a detach event and looking for a new
attach.
