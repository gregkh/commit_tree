sctp: remove the typedef sctp_cmd_seq_t

This patch is to remove the typedef sctp_cmd_seq_t, and
replace with struct sctp_cmd_seq in the places where it's
using this typedef.

Note that it doesn't fix many indents although it should,
as sctp_disposition_t's removal would mess them up again.
So better to fix them when removing sctp_disposition_t in
the later patch.
