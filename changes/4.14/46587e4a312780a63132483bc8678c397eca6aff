net: dsa: remove PHY device argument from .set_eee

The DSA switch operations for EEE are only meant to configure a port's
MAC EEE settings. The port's PHY EEE settings are accessed by the DSA
layer and must be made available via a proper PHY driver.

In order to reduce this confusion, remove the phy_device argument from
the .set_eee operation.
