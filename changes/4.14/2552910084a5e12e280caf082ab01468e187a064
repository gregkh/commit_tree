powerpc/powernv: Enable PCI peer-to-peer

P9 has support for PCI peer-to-peer, enabling a device to write in the
MMIO space of another device directly, without interrupting the CPU.

This patch adds support for it on powernv, by adding a new API to be
called by drivers. The pnv_pci_set_p2p(...) call configures an
'initiator', i.e the device which will issue the MMIO operation, and a
'target', i.e. the device on the receiving side.

P9 really only supports MMIO stores for the time being but that's
expected to change in the future, so the API allows to define both
load and store operations.

  /* PCI p2p descriptor */
  #define OPAL_PCI_P2P_ENABLE           0x1
  #define OPAL_PCI_P2P_LOAD             0x2
  #define OPAL_PCI_P2P_STORE            0x4

  int pnv_pci_set_p2p(struct pci_dev *initiator, struct pci_dev *target,
                      u64 desc)

It uses a new OPAL call, as the configuration magic is done on the
PHBs by skiboot.
