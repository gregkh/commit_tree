genirq: Let irq_set_vcpu_affinity() iterate over hierarchy

When assigning an interrupt to a vcpu, it is not unlikely that
the level of the hierarchy implementing irq_set_vcpu_affinity
is not the top level (think a generic MSI domain on top of a
virtualization aware interrupt controller).

In such a case, let's iterate over the hierarchy until we find
an irqchip implementing it.
