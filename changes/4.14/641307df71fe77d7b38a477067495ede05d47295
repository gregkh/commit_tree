drm: rcar-du: Fix race condition when disabling planes at CRTC stop

When stopping the CRTC the driver must disable all planes and wait for
the change to take effect at the next vblank. Merely calling
drm_crtc_wait_one_vblank() is not enough, as the function doesn't
include any mechanism to handle the race with vblank interrupts.

Replace the drm_crtc_wait_one_vblank() call with a manual mechanism that
handles the vblank interrupt race.
