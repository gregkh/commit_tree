clk: fractional-divider: allow overriding of approximation

Fractional dividers may have special requirements concerning numerator
and denominator selection that differ from just getting the best
approximation.

For example on Rockchip socs the denominator must be at least 20 times
larger than the numerator to generate precise clock frequencies.

Therefore add the ability to provide custom approximation functions.
