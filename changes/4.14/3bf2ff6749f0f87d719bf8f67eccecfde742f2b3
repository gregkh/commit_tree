scsi: Suppress gcc 7 fall-through warnings reported with W=1

The conclusion of a recent discussion about the new warnings
reported by gcc 7 is that the new warnings reported when building
with W=1 should be suppressed. However, gcc 7 still warns about
fall-through in switch statements when building with W=1. Suppress
these warnings by annotating the SCSI core properly.
