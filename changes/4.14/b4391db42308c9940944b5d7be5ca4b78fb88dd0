netlink: fix nla_put_{u8,u16,u32} for KASAN

When CONFIG_KASAN is enabled, the "--param asan-stack=1" causes rather large
stack frames in some functions. This goes unnoticed normally because
CONFIG_FRAME_WARN is disabled with CONFIG_KASAN by default as of commit
3f181b4d8652 ("lib/Kconfig.debug: disable -Wframe-larger-than warnings with
KASAN=y").

The kernelci.org build bot however has the warning enabled and that led
me to investigate it a little further, as every build produces these warnings:

net/wireless/nl80211.c:4389:1: warning: the frame size of 2240 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/wireless/nl80211.c:1895:1: warning: the frame size of 3776 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/wireless/nl80211.c:1410:1: warning: the frame size of 2208 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/bridge/br_netlink.c:1282:1: warning: the frame size of 2544 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

Most of this problem is now solved in gcc-8, which can consolidate
the stack slots for the inline function arguments. On older compilers
we can add a workaround by declaring a local variable in each function
to pass the inline function argument.
