scsi: lpfc: Correct return error codes to align with nvme_fc transport

Modify driver return error codes to align with host nvme transport.

Driver isn't returning Exxx error codes to properly reflect out of
resource or connectivity conditions (-EBUSY), yet there were hard error
conditions returning -EBUSY.

Ensure the following situations return the proper return code:

 - Temporary failures or temporary resource availability: -EBUSY

 - Connectivity issues: -ENODEV

All others are treated as hard errors and return an -Exxx value that
indicates the type of error.

Also, lpfc_sli4_issue_wqe() was modified to not translate error from
-Exxx to WQE state.  This allows lpfc_nvme_fcp_io_submit() routine to
just return whatever -E value was returned from other routines.
