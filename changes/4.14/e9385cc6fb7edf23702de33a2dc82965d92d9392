xfs: ordered buffer log items are never formatted

Ordered buffers pass through the logging infrastructure without ever
being written to the log. The way this works is that the ordered
buffer status is transferred to the log vector at commit time via
the ->iop_size() callback. In xlog_cil_insert_format_items(),
ordered log vectors bypass ->iop_format() processing altogether.

Therefore it is unnecessary for xfs_buf_item_format() to handle
ordered buffers. Remove the unnecessary logic and assert that an
ordered buffer never reaches this point.
