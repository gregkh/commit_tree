powerpc/mm: Make bad_area* helper functions

Instead of goto labels, instead call those functions and return.

This gets us closer to x86 and allows us to shring do_page_fault()
even more.

The main difference with x86 is that those function return a value
which we then return from do_page_fault(). That value is our
return value from do_page_fault() which we use to generate
kernel faults.
