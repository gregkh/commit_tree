net/unix: don't show information about sockets from other namespaces

socket_diag shows information only about sockets from a namespace where
a diag socket lives.

But if we request information about one unix socket, the kernel don't
check that its netns is matched with a diag socket namespace, so any
user can get information about any unix socket in a system. This looks
like a bug.

v2: add a Fixes tag
