Input: aiptek - constify attribute_group structures

attribute_groups are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_groups provided by <linux/sysfs.h> work with const
attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   9941	   1560	      0	  11501	   2ced	drivers/input/tablet/aiptek.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  10005	   1496	      0	  11501	   2ced	drivers/input/tablet/aiptek.o
