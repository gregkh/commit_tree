ALSA: control: code refactoring TLV ioctl handler

In a design of ALSA control core, execution path bifurcates depending on
target element. When a set with the target element has a handler, it's
called. Else, registered buffer is copied to user space. These two
operations are apparently different.  In current implementation, they're
on the same function with a condition statement. This makes it a bit hard
to understand conditions of each case.

This commit splits codes for these two cases.
