x86/kvm: Move kvm_fastop_exception to .fixup section

When compiling the kernel with the '-frecord-gcc-switches' flag, objtool
complains:

  arch/x86/kvm/emulate.o: warning: objtool: .GCC.command.line+0x0: special: can't find new instruction

And also the kernel fails to link.

The problem is that the 'kvm_fastop_exception' code gets placed into the
throwaway '.GCC.command.line' section instead of '.text'.

Exception fixup code is conventionally placed in the '.fixup' section,
so put it there where it belongs.
