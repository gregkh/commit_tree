PCI: Add a generic weak pcibios_fixup_bus()

Multiple architectures define this as an empty function, and I'm adding
another one as part of the RISC-V port.  Add a __weak version of
pcibios_fixup_bus() and delete the now-obselete ones in a handful of
ports.

The only functional change should be that microblaze used to export
pcibios_fixup_bus().  None of the other architectures exports this, so I
just dropped it.
