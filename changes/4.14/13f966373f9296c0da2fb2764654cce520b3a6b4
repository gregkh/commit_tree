percpu: skip chunks if the alloc does not fit in the contig hint

This patch adds chunk->contig_bits_start to keep track of the contig
hint's offset and the check to skip the chunk if it does not fit. If
the chunk's contig hint starting offset cannot satisfy an allocation,
the allocator assumes there is enough memory pressure in this chunk to
either use a different chunk or create a new one. This accepts a less
tight packing for a smoother latency curve.
