kernfs: don't set dentry->d_fsdata

When working on adding exportfs operations in kernfs, I found it's hard
to initialize dentry->d_fsdata in the exportfs operations. Looks there
is no way to do it without race condition. Look at the kernfs code
closely, there is no point to set dentry->d_fsdata. inode->i_private
already points to kernfs_node, and we can get inode from a dentry. So
this patch just delete the d_fsdata usage.
