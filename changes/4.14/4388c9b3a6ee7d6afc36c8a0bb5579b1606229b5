powerpc: Do not send system reset request through the oops path

A system reset is a request to crash / debug the system rather than
necessarily caused by encountering a BUG. So there is no need to
serialize all CPUs behind the die lock, adding taints to all
subsequent traces beyond the first, breaking console locks, etc.

The system reset is NMI context which has its own printk buffers to
prevent output being interleaved. Then it's better to have all
secondaries print out their debug as quickly as possible and the
primary will flush out all printk buffers during panic().

So remove the 0x100 path from die, and move it into system_reset. Name
the crash/dump reasons "System Reset".

This gives "not tained" traces when crashing an untainted kernel. It
also gives the panic reason as "System Reset" as opposed to "Fatal
exception in interrupt" (or "die oops" for fadump).
