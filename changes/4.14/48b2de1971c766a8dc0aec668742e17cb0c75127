media: rc: saa7134: add trailing space for timely decoding

The gpio-ir-recv driver adds timeouts which the saa7134 lacks; this
causes keypress not to arrive, and to only arrive once more IR is
received. This is what the commit below calls "ghost keypresses",
and that commit does not solve the issue completely.

This makes the IR on the HVR-1150 much more reliable and responsive.
