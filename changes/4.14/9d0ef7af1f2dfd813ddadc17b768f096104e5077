cpufreq: intel_pstate: Do not use PID-based P-state selection

All systems with a defined ACPI preferred profile that are not
"servers" have been using the load-based P-state selection algorithm
in intel_pstate since 4.12-rc1 (mobile systems and laptops have been
using it since 4.10-rc1) and no problems with it have been reported
to date.  In particular, no regressions with respect to the PID-based
P-state selection have been reported.  Also testing indicates that
the P-state selection algorithm based on CPU load is generally on par
with the PID-based algorithm performance-wise, and for some workloads
it turns out to be better than the other one, while being more
straightforward and easier to understand at the same time.

Moreover, the PID-based P-state selection algorithm in intel_pstate
is known to be unstable in some situation and generally problematic,
the issues with it are hard to address and it has become a
significant maintenance burden.

For these reasons, make intel_pstate use the "powersave" P-state
selection algorithm based on CPU load in the active mode on all
systems and drop the PID-based P-state selection code along with
all things related to it from the driver.  Also update the
documentation accordingly.
