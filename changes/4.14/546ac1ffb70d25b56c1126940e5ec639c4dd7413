bpf: add devmap, a map for storing net device references

Device map (devmap) is a BPF map, primarily useful for networking
applications, that uses a key to lookup a reference to a netdevice.

The map provides a clean way for BPF programs to build virtual port
to physical port maps. Additionally, it provides a scoping function
for the redirect action itself allowing multiple optimizations. Future
patches will leverage the map to provide batching at the XDP layer.

Another optimization/feature, that is not yet implemented, would be
to support multiple netdevices per key to support efficient multicast
and broadcast support.
