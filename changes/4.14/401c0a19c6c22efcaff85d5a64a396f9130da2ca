nfit, libnvdimm, region: export 'position' in mapping info

It is useful to be able to know the position of a DIMM in an
interleave-set. Consider the case where the order of the DIMMs changes
causing a namespace to be invalidated because the interleave-set cookie no
longer matches. If the before and after state of each DIMM position is
known this state debugged by the system owner.
