IB/core: Fix the validations of a multicast LID in attach or detach operations

RoCE Annex (A16.9.10/11) declares that during attach (detach) QP to a
multicast group, if the QP is associated with a RoCE port, the
multicast group MLID is unused and is ignored.

During attach or detach multicast, when the QP is associated with a
port, it is enough to check the port's link layer and validate the
LID only if it is Infiniband. Otherwise, avoid validating the
multicast LID.
