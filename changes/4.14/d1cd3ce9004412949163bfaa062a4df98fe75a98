KVM: MMU: check guest CR3 reserved bits based on its physical address width.

Currently, KVM uses CR3_L_MODE_RESERVED_BITS to check the
reserved bits in CR3. Yet the length of reserved bits in
guest CR3 should be based on the physical address width
exposed to the VM. This patch changes CR3 check logic to
calculate the reserved bits at runtime.
