MIPS: MSP71xx: Include asm/setup.h

msp71xx_defconfig can not be built at the in v4.14-rc1

arch/mips/pmcs-msp71xx/msp_smp.c:72:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'set_vi_handler' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

I don't know what caused the regression, but including the right
header is the obvious fix.
