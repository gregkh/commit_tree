rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix HW_VAR_NAV_UPPER operation

The cast here is wrong.  We want to cast the pointer but we accidentally
do a no-op cast of the value.  We normally want to set us_nav_upper to
WIFI_NAV_UPPER_US (30000) but because of this bug we instead set it to
184 on little endian systems and 0 on big endian ones.
