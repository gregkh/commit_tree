i40e: synchronize nvmupdate command and adminq subtask

During NVM update, state machine gets into unrecoverable state because
i40e_clean_adminq_subtask can get scheduled after the admin queue
command but before other state variables are updated. This causes
incorrect input to i40e_nvmupd_check_wait_event and state transitions
don't happen.

This issue existed before but surfaced after commit 373149fc99a0
("i40e: Decrease the scope of rtnl lock")

This fix adds locking around admin queue command and update of
state variables so that adminq_subtask will have accurate information
whenever it gets scheduled.
