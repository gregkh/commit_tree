KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: POWER9 more doorbell fixes

- Add another case where msgsync is required.
- Required barrier sequence for global doorbells is msgsync ; lwsync

When msgsnd is used for IPIs to other cores, msgsync must be executed by
the target to order stores performed on the source before its msgsnd
(provided the source executes the appropriate sync).
