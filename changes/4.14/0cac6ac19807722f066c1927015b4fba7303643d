drm: todo: Avoid accidental crossreferences

RST uses underscores at the end of words to create crossreferences and
it will accidentally try to link to tinydrm_ and drm_fb_ targets from
the TODO, which is clearly not the intention in this context.

Use backslashes to escape the special meaning of the underscore.
