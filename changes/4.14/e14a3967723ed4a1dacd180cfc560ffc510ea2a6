scsi: remove DRIVER_ATTR() usage

It's better to use the DRIVER_ATTR_RW() and DRIVER_ATTR_RO() macros to
explicitly show that this is a read/write or read/only sysfs file.  So
convert the remaining SCSI drivers that use the old style to use the
newer macros.

Bonus is that this removes some checkpatch.pl warnings :)

This is part of a series to drop DRIVER_ATTR() from the tree entirely.
