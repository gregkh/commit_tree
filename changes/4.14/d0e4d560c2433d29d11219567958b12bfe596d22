xen/pvcalls: connect to a frontend

Introduce a per-frontend data structure named pvcalls_fedata. It
contains pointers to the command ring, its event channel, a list of
active sockets and a tree of passive sockets (passing sockets need to be
looked up from the id on listen, accept and poll commands, while active
sockets only on release).

It also has an unbound workqueue to schedule the work of parsing and
executing commands on the command ring. socket_lock protects the two
lists. In pvcalls_back_global, keep a list of connected frontends.
