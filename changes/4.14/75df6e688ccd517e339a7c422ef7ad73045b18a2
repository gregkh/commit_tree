tracing: Fix trace_pipe behavior for instance traces

When reading data from trace_pipe, tracing_wait_pipe() performs a
check to see if tracing has been turned off after some data was read.
Currently, this check always looks at global trace state, but it
should be checking the trace instance where trace_pipe is located at.

Because of this bug, cat instances/i1/trace_pipe in the following
script will immediately exit instead of waiting for data:

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 0 > tracing_on
mkdir -p instances/i1
echo 1 > instances/i1/tracing_on
echo 1 > instances/i1/events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable
cat instances/i1/trace_pipe
