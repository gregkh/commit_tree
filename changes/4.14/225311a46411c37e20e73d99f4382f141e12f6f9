mm: test code to write THP to swap device as a whole

To support delay splitting THP (Transparent Huge Page) after swapped
out, we need to enhance swap writing code to support to write a THP as a
whole.  This will improve swap write IO performance.

As Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com> pointed out, this should be based on
multipage bvec support, which hasn't been merged yet.  So this patch is
only for testing the functionality of the other patches in the series.
And will be reimplemented after multipage bvec support is merged.
