net/sched: cls_flower: Set egress_dev mark when calling into the HW driver

Commit 7091d8c '(net/sched: cls_flower: Add offload support using egress
Hardware device') made sure (when fl_hw_replace_filter is called) to put
the egress_dev mark on persisent structure instance. Hence, following calls
into the HW driver for stats and deletion will note it and act accordingly.

With commit de4784ca030f this property is lost and hence when called,
the HW driver failes to operate (stats, delete) on the offloaded flow.

Fix it by setting the egress_dev flag whenever the ingress device is
different from the hw device since this is exactly the condition under
which we're calling into the HW driver through the egress port net-device.

Fixes: de4784ca030f ('net: sched: get rid of struct tc_to_netdev')
