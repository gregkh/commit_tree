xhci: Cleanup current_cmd in xhci_cleanup_command_queue()

KASAN reported use-after-free bug when xhci host controller died:
[  176.952537] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in xhci_handle_command_timeout+0x68/0x224
[  176.960846] Write of size 4 at addr ffffffc0cbb01608 by task kworker/3:3/1680
...
[  177.180644] Freed by task 0:
[  177.183882]  kasan_slab_free+0x90/0x15c
[  177.188194]  kfree+0x114/0x28c
[  177.191630]  xhci_cleanup_command_queue+0xc8/0xf8
[  177.196916]  xhci_hc_died+0x84/0x358

Problem here is that when the cmd_timer fired, it would try to access
current_cmd while the command queue is already freed by xhci_hc_died().

Cleanup current_cmd in xhci_cleanup_command_queue() to avoid that.
