IB/mlx4: Add inline-receive support

When inline-receive is enabled, the HCA may write received
data into the receive WQE.

Inline-receive is enabled by setting its matching bit in
the QP context and each single-packet message with payload
not exceeding the receive WQE size will be delivered to
the WQE.

The completion report will indicate that the payload was placed to the WQE.

It includes:
1) Return maximum supported size of inline-receive by the hardware
in query_device vendor's data part.
2) Enable the feature when requested by the vendor data input.
