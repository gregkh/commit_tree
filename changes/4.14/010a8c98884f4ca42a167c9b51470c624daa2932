ARC: boot log: decontaminate ARCv2 ISA_CONFIG register

ARCv2 ISA_CONFIG and ARC700_BUILD build config registers are not
compatible. cpuinfo_arc had isa info placeholder which was mashup of bits
form both.

Untangle this by defining it off of ARCv2 ISA info and it is fine even
for ARC700 since former is a super set of latter (ARC700 buildonly has 2
bits for atomics and stack check).

At runtime, we treat ARCv2 ISA info as a generic placeholder but
populate it correctly depending on ARC700 or HS.

This paves way for adding more HS specific bits in isa info which was
colliding with the extra bits for arc700.
