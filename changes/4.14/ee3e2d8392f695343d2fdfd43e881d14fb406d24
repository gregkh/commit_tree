scsi: mptsas: Fixup device hotplug for VMWare ESXi

VMWare ESXi emulates an mptsas HBA, but exposes all drives as
direct-attached SAS drives.  This it not how the driver originally
envisioned things; SAS drives were supposed to be connected via an
expander, and only SATA drives would be direct attached.  As such, any
hotplug event for direct-attach SAS drives was silently ignored, and the
guest failed to detect new drives from within a VMWare ESXi environment.
