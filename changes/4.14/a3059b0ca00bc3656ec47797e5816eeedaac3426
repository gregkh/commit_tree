powerpc/8xx: Make pinning of ITLBs optional

As stated in a comment in head_8xx.S, today we "Always pin the first
8 MB ITLB to prevent ITLB misses while mucking around with SRR0/SRR1
in asm".

This issue has just been cleared by the preceding patch, therefore
we can make this pinning optional (on by default) and independent
of DATA pinning.

This patch also makes pinning of IMMR independent of pinning of DATA.
