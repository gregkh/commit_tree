arm64: dts: rockchip: disable tx ipgap linecheck for rk3399 dwc3

RK3399 USB DWC3 controller has a issue that FS/LS devices not
recognized if inserted through USB 3.0 HUB. It's because that
the inter-packet delay between the SSPLIT token to SETUP token
is about 566ns, more then the USB spec requirement.

This patch adds a quirk "snps,dis-tx-ipgap-linecheck-quirk" to
disable the u2mac linestate check to decrease the SSPLIT token
to SETUP token inter-packet delay from 566ns to 466ns.
