media: ca.h: document ca_msg and the corresponding ioctls

Usually, CA messages are sent/received via reading/writing at
the CA device node. However, two drivers (dst_ca and firedtv-ci)
also implement it via ioctls.

Apparently, on both cases, the net result is the same.

Anyway, let's document it.
