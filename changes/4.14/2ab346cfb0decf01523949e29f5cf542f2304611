perf/aux: Make aux_{head,wakeup} ring_buffer members long

The aux_head and aux_wakeup members of struct ring_buffer are defined
using the local_t type, despite the fact that they are only accessed via
the perf_aux_output_*() functions, which cannot race with each other for a
given ring buffer.

This patch changes the type of the members to long, so we can avoid
using the local_*() API where it isn't needed.
