Earlier commit:
"spi: Pick spi bus number from Linux idr or spi alias"
(SHA1:9b61e302210eba55768962f2f11e96bb508c2408)
has introduced some checkpatch issues. As pointed by
Lukas Wunner this patch does the following:
- remove whitespaces
- fix warnings, suspect code indent for conditional statements
- fix errors, code indent should use tabs
- remove spaces at the start of the line
