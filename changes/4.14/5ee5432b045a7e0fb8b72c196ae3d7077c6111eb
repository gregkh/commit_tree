docs: Do not include from drivers/scsi/constants.c

The only function of interest in that file was scsi_print_status().  That
function was removed in commit 7ac7076344d9 (scsi: remove
scsi_print_status()) but the docs were not changed to match, yielding this
warning:

    ./drivers/scsi/constants.c:1: warning: no structured comments found

There's nothing there anymore, so just remove that section from the docs.
