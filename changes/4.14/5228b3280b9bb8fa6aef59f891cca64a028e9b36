nvme: fix uninitialized prp2 value on small transfers

The value of iod->first_dma ends up as prp2 in NVMe commands. In case
there is not enough data to cross a page boundary, iod->first_dma is
never initialized and contains random data.

Comply with the NVMe specification and fill in 0 in that case.
