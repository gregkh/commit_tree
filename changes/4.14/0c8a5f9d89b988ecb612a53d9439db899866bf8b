misc: pci_endpoint_test: Enable/Disable MSI using module param

In certain platforms like TI's DRA7 SoCs, use of legacy PCI interrupt is
exclusive with use of MSI (Section 24.9.4.6.2.1 Legacy PCI Interrupts in
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhz6i/spruhz6i.pdf).

However pci_endpoint_test driver enables MSI by default in probe.  In order
for pci_endpoint_test to be able to test legacy interrupt, MSI should be
disabled. Add a module param 'no_msi' to disable MSI (only when legacy
interrupt has to be tested).
