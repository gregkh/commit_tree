GFS2: Don't waste time locking lru_lock for non-lru glocks

Before this patch, glock_dq would call gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru.
For glocks that are never put on the LRU, such as the transaction
glock, this just takes the spin_lock, determines there's nothing to
be done because the list is empty, then unlocks again. This was
causing unnecessary lock contention on the lru_lock spin_lock.
This patch adds a check for GLOF_LRU in the glops before taking
the spin_lock.
