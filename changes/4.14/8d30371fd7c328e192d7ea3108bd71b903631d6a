scsi: fc: check for rport presence in fc_block_scsi_eh

Coverity-scan recently found a possible NULL pointer dereference in
fc_block_scsi_eh() as starget_to_rport() either returns the rport for
the startget or NULL.

While it is rather unlikely to have fc_block_scsi_eh() called without an
rport associated it's a good idea to catch potential misuses of the API
gracefully.
