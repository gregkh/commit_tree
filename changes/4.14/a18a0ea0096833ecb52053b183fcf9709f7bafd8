drm/msm/dsi: Use correct pm_runtime_put variant during host_init

The DSI runtime PM suspend/resume callbacks check whether
msm_host->cfg_hnd is non-NULL before trying to enable the bus clocks.
This is done to accommodate early calls to these functions that may
happen before the bus clocks are even initialized.

Calling pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() in dsi_host_init() can result in
racy behaviour since msm_host->cfg_hnd is set very soon after. If the
suspend callback happens too late, we end up trying to disable clocks
that were never enabled, resulting in a bunch of WARN_ON splats.

Use pm_runtime_put_sync() so that the suspend callback is called
immediately.
