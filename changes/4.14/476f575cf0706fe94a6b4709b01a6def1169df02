staging: lustre: lov: Ensure correct operation for large object sizes

If a backing filesystem (ZFS) returns that it supports very large
(LLONG_MAX) object sizes, that should be correctly supported.  This
fixes the check for unitialized stripe_maxbytes in
lsm_unpackmd_common(), so that ZFS can return LLONG_MAX and it will be
okay. This issue is excersized by writing to or past the 2TB boundry
of a singly stripped file.
