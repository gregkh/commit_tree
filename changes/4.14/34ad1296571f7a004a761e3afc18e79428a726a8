mm, memory_hotplug: remove explicit build_all_zonelists from try_online_node

try_online_node calls hotadd_new_pgdat which already calls
build_all_zonelists.  So the additional call is redundant.  Even though
hotadd_new_pgdat will only initialize zonelists of the new node this is
the right thing to do because such a node doesn't have any memory so
other zonelists would ignore all the zones from this node anyway.
