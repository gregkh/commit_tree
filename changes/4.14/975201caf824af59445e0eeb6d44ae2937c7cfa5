MAINTAINERS: update ARM/ZTE entry

Update ARM/ZTE entry to include all those ZTE ZX platform drivers and
files that do not have a separate MAINTAINERS entry.

Since I have been contributing a lot for ZTE ZX SoCs support and
collecting platform patches for a few cycles, add myself as one
maintainer for the platform.
