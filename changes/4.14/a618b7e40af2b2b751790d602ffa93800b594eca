IB/hfi1: Move saving PCI values to a separate function

During PCIe initialization some registers' values from
PCI config space are saved in order to restore them later
(i.e. after reset). Restoring those value is done by a
function called restore_pci_variables, while saving them
is put directly into function hfi1_pcie_ddinit.
Move saving values to a separate function in the image
of restoring functionality.
