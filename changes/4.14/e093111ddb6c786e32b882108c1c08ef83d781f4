IB/core: Fix input len in multiple user verbs

Most user verbs pass user data to the kernel with the inclusion of the
ib_uverbs_cmd_hdr structure. This is problematic because the vendor has
no ideas if the verb was called by a legacy verb or an extended verb.
Also, the incosistency between the verbs is confusing.
