locks: restore a warn for leaked locks on close

When locks.c moved to using file_lock_context, the check for any locks that
were not released was moved from the __fput() to destroy_inode() path in
commit 8634b51f6ca2 ("locks: convert lease handling to file_lock_context").
This warning has been quite useful for catching bugs, particularly in NFS
where lock handling still sees some churn.

Let's bring back the warning for leaked locks on __fput, as this warning is
much more likely to be seen and reported by users.
