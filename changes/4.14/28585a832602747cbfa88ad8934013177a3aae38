rcu: Allow for page faults in NMI handlers

A number of architecture invoke rcu_irq_enter() on exception entry in
order to allow RCU read-side critical sections in the exception handler
when the exception is from an idle or nohz_full CPU.  This works, at
least unless the exception happens in an NMI handler.  In that case,
rcu_nmi_enter() would already have exited the extended quiescent state,
which would mean that rcu_irq_enter() would (incorrectly) cause RCU
to think that it is again in an extended quiescent state.  This will
in turn result in lockdep splats in response to later RCU read-side
critical sections.

This commit therefore causes rcu_irq_enter() and rcu_irq_exit() to
take no action if there is an rcu_nmi_enter() in effect, thus avoiding
the unscheduled return to RCU quiescent state.  This in turn should
make the kernel safe for on-demand RCU voyeurism.
