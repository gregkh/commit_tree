ipv6: sr: allow SRH insertion with arbitrary segments_left value

The seg6_validate_srh() function only allows SRHs whose active segment is
the first segment of the path. However, an application may insert an SRH
whose active segment is not the first one. Such an application might be
for example an SR-aware Virtual Network Function.

This patch enables to insert SRHs with an arbitrary active segment.
