RDMA: Simplify get firmware interface

There is a need to forward FW version to user space
application through RDMA netlink. In order to make it safe, there
is need to declare nla_policy and limit the size of FW string.

The new define IB_FW_VERSION_NAME_MAX will limit the size of
FW version string. That define was chosen to be equal to
ETHTOOL_FWVERS_LEN, because many drivers anyway are limited
by that value indirectly.

The introduction of this define allows us to remove the string size
from get_fw_str function signature.
