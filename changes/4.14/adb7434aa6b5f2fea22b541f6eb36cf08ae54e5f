mmc: host: via-sdmmc: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   6952	    880	      0	   7832	   1e98	drivers/mmc/host/via-sdmmc.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   7032	    800	      0	   7832	   1e98	drivers/mmc/host/via-sdmmc.o
