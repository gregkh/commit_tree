xen/pvcalls: implement connect command

Allocate a socket. Keep track of socket <-> ring mappings with a new data
structure, called sock_mapping. Implement the connect command by calling
inet_stream_connect, and mapping the new indexes page and data ring.
Allocate a workqueue and a work_struct, called ioworker, to perform
reads and writes to the socket.

When an active socket is closed (sk_state_change), set in_error to
-ENOTCONN and notify the other end, as specified by the protocol.

sk_data_ready and pvcalls_back_ioworker will be implemented later.
