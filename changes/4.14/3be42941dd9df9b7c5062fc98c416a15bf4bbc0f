watchdog: renesas_wdt: consistently use RuntimePM for clock management

On Renesas R-Car archs, RuntimePM does all the clock handling. So, use
it consistently to enable/disable the clocks. Also make sure that clocks
are really enabled around clk_get_rate(). clk_summary looks proper now:

		clock	enable_cnt	prepare_cnt	rate ...
