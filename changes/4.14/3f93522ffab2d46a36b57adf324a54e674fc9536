virtio-net: switch off offloads on demand if possible on XDP set

Current XDP implementation wants guest offloads feature to be disabled
on device. This is inconvenient and means guest can't benefit from
offloads if XDP is not used. This patch tries to address this
limitation by disabling the offloads on demand through control guest
offloads. Guest offloads will be disabled and enabled on demand on XDP
set.
