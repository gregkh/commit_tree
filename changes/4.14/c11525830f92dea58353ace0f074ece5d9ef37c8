mm/memory_hotplug: just build zonelist for newly added node

Commit 9adb62a5df9c ("mm/hotplug: correctly setup fallback zonelists
when creating new pgdat") tries to build the correct zonelist for a
newly added node, while it is not necessary to rebuild it for already
exist nodes.

In build_zonelists(), it will iterate on nodes with memory.  For a newly
added node, it will have memory until node_states_set_node() is called
in online_pages().

This patch avoids rebuilding the zonelists for already existing nodes.

build_zonelists_node() uses managed_zone(zone) checks, so it should not
include empty zones anyway.  So effectively we avoid some pointless work
under stop_machine().
