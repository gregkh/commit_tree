drm/<drivers>: Drop fbdev info flags

- FBINFO_CAN_FORCE_OUTPUT has been a lie ever since we nerfed&removed
  the entire panic handling code in our fbdev emulation. We might
  restore kms panic output, but not through the bazillion of legacy
  code layers called fbdev/fbcon, there's just no way to make that
  work safely.

- With the module check change FBINFO_DEFAULT is always 0, so can be
  removed too.

That removes another change to cargo-cult stuff in kms drivers, yay!
