net/mlx5e: Slightly increase RX page-cache size

In XDP_TX flow, we now get back quicker to each page in page-cache,
and on some occasions refcount does not get back to 1 on time, causing
some costly page allocations.
Slightly increase the size of RX page-cache to significantly decrease
the chances for this to happen.
