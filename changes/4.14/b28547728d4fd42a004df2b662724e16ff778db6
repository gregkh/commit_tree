liquidio: change manner of detecting whether or not NIC firmware is loaded

In the NIC firmware, the 1-bit flag indicating "firmware is loaded" moved
from SLI_SCRATCH_1 to SLI_SCRATCH_2 (these are Octeon general-purpose
scratch registers).  Make the PF driver conform to this change.

Remove code that sets the "firmware is loaded" flag because it's now the
firmware's job to do that.

In the code that detects whether or not the firmware is loaded, don't just
rely on checking the "firmware is loaded" flag because that may cause a
rare false negative.  Add code that deduces whether or not the firmware is
loaded; that will never give a false negative.

Also bump up driver version to match newer NIC firmware.
