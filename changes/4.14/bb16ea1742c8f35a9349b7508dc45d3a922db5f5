mmc: sdhci-xenon: Fix clock resource by adding an optional bus clock

On Armada 7K/8K we need to explicitly enable the bus clock. The bus clock
is optional because not all the SoCs need them but at least for Armada
7K/8K it is actually mandatory.

The binding documentation is updating accordingly.

Without this patch the kernel hand during boot if the mvpp2.2 network
driver was not present in the kernel. Indeed the clock needed by the
xenon controller was set by the network driver.

functionality)"
