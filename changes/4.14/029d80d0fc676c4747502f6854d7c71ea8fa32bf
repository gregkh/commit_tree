drm/i915: Assign everywhere the always-on power well ID

Power well IDs are used for lookup so they must be unique. To ensure
this assign the always-on power well ID everywhere where it's missing.
This didn't cause a problem so far, since we didn't need to look up
power wells that happened to share their IDs.
