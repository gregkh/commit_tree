i40e: Use correct flag to enable egress traffic for unicast promisc

Albeit, we usually set true promiscuous mode for both multicast and
unicast at the same time - however, it is possible to set it
individually, so using allmulti flag which is only for allmulticast might
caused unwanted behavior in mirroring egress traffic promiscuous for
unicast in VF.
