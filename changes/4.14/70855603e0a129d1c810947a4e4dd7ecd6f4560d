bnxt_en: fix clearing devlink ptr from bnxt struct

The routine bnxt_link_bp_to_dl() is used to set the devlink ptr
in bnxt struct (bp) and also to set the bnxt back ptr in
the devlink struct.  If devlink_register() fails, bp->dl must
be cleared which is not happening currently. This patch fixes
bnxt_link_bp_to_dl() to clear bp->dl by passing  a NULL dl ptr.
