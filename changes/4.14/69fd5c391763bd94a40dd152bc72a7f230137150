blktrace: add an option to allow displaying cgroup path

By default we output cgroup id in blktrace. This adds an option to
display cgroup path. Since get cgroup path is a relativly heavy
operation, we don't enable it by default.

with the option enabled, blktrace will output something like this:
dd-1353  [007] d..2   293.015252:   8,0   /test/level  D   R 24 + 8 [dd]
