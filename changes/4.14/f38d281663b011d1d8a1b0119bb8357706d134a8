perf script python: Add perf_sample dict to tracepoint handlers

The process_event python hook receives a dict with all perf_sample
entries, but the tracepoint specific and trace_unhandled hooks predate
the introduction of this dict, and do not receive it.

Add the aforementioned dict as an additional argument to the affected
handlers. To keep backwards compatibility (and avoid unnecessary work),
do not pass the dict if the number of arguments signals that handler
version predates this change.
