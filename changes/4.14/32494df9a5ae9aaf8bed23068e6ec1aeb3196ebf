skd: Initialize skd_special_context.req.n_sg to one

The debug code in skd_send_special_fitmsg() assumes that req.n_sg
represents the number of S/G descriptors. However, skd_construct()
initializes that member variable to zero. Set req.n_sg to one such
that the debugging code in skd_send_special_fitmsg() works as
expected.
