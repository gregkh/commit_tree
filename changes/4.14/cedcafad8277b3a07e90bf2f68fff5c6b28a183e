nullb: add interface to power on disk

The device created in nullb configfs interface isn't power on by
default. After user configures the device, user can do 'echo 1 >
xxx/nullb/device_name/power' to power on the device, which will create a
disk. the xxx/nullb/device_name/index is the disk index, so if the index
is 2, the new created disk should be named as /dev/nullb2. Note, the
'index' is only valid after disk is power on.

'echo 0 > xxx/nullb/device_name/power' will remove the disk. Note, this
doesn't remove the device. To remove the device, user should do 'rmdir
xxx/nullb/device_name'. Removing the device will remove the disk too.
