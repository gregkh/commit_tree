lkdtm: Add -fstack-protector-strong test

There wasn't an LKDTM test to distinguish between -fstack-protector and
-fstack-protector-strong in use. This adds CORRUPT_STACK_STRONG to see
the difference. Also adjusts the stack-clobber value to 0xff so execution
won't potentially jump into userspace when the stack protector is missing.
