binder: fix incorrect cmd to binder_stat_br

commit 26549d177410 ("binder: guarantee txn complete / errors delivered
in-order") passed the locally declared and undefined cmd
to binder_stat_br() which results in a bogus cmd field in a trace
event and BR stats are incremented incorrectly.

Change to use e->cmd which has been initialized.
