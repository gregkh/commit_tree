MAINTAINERS: associate linux/fs.h with VFS instead of file locking

include/linux/fs.h and include/uapi/linux/fs.h deal with much more than
just file locking.  Move them to the "FILESYSTEMS (VFS and
infrastructure)" section of the MAINTAINERS file so that the first
suggestion from get_maintainer.pl isn't the file locking maintainers,
which has caused some confusion.
