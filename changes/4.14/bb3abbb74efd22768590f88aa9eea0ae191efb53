media: vimc: set id_table for platform drivers

The vimc platform drivers define a platform device ID table but these
are not set to the .id_table field in the platform driver structure.

So the platform device ID table is only used to fill the aliases in
the module but are not used for matching (works because the platform
subsystem fallbacks to the driver's name if no .id_table is set).

But this also means that the platform device ID table isn't used if
the driver is built-in, which leads to the following build warning:

This causes the following build warnings when the driver is built-in:
