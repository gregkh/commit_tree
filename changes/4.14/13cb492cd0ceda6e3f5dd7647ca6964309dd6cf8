staging: typec: tcpm: Consider port_type while determining unattached_state

While performing PORT_RESET, upon receiving the cc disconnect
signal from the underlaying tcpc device, TCPM transitions into
unattached state. Consider the current type of port while determining
the unattached state.

In the below logs, although the port_type was set to sink, TCPM
transitioned into SRC_UNATTACHED.

[  762.290654] state change SRC_READY -> PORT_RESET
[  762.324531] Setting voltage/current limit 0 mV 0 mA
[  762.327912] polarity 0
[  762.334864] cc:=0
[  762.347193] pending state change PORT_RESET -> PORT_RESET_WAIT_OFF @ 100 ms
[  762.347200] VBUS off
[  762.347203] CC1: 2 -> 0, CC2: 0 -> 0 [state PORT_RESET, polarity 0, disconnected]
[  762.347206] state change PORT_RESET -> SRC_UNATTACHED
