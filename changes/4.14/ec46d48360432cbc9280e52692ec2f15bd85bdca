drm/i915/hsw, bdw: Split power well set to enable/disable helpers

We can reduce the code indentation by splitting the set helper to
separate enable/disable helpers. This also allows us to unify the
HSW/BDW and GEN9+ power well ops in follow-up patches, which introduces
some differences between the enable and disable helpers.

While at it also remove the redundant enable/disable debug messages,
the same info is printed already elsewhere.
