can: bcm: check for null sk before deferencing it via the call to sock_net

The assignment of net via call sock_net will dereference sk. This
is performed before a sanity null check on sk, so there could be
a potential null dereference on the sock_net call if sk is null.
Fix this by assigning net after the sk null check. Also replace
the sk == NULL with the more usual !sk idiom.
