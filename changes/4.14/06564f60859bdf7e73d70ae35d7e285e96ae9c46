IB/ocrdma: fix incorrect fall-through on switch statement

In the case where mbox_status is OCRDMA_MBX_STATUS_FAILED and
add_status is OCRDMA_MBX_STATUS_FAILED err_num is assigned -EAGAIN
however the case OCRDMA_MBX_STATUS_FAILED is missing a break and
falls through to the default case which then re-assigns err_num
to -EFAULT.   Fix this so that err_num is assigned to -EAGAIN
for the add_status OCRDMA_MBX_STATUS_FAILED case and -EFAULT
otherwise.
