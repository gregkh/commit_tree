s390/zcrypt: externalize test AP queue

Under certain specified conditions, the Test AP Queue (TAPQ)
subfunction of the Process Adjunct Processor Queue (PQAP) instruction
will be intercepted by a guest VM. The guest VM must have a means for
executing the intercepted instruction.

The vfio_ap driver will provide an interface to execute the
PQAP(TAPQ) instruction subfunction on behalf of a guest VM.
The code for executing the AP instructions currently resides in the
AP bus. This patch refactors the AP bus code to externalize access
to the PQAP(TAPQ) instruction subfunction to make it available to
the vfio_ap driver.
