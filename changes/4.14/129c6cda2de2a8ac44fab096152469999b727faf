8139too: revisit napi_complete_done() usage

It seems we have to be more careful in napi_complete_done()
use. This patch is not a revert, as it seems we can
avoid bug that Ville reported by moving the napi_complete_done()
test in the spinlock section.

Many thanks to Ville for detective work and all tests.
