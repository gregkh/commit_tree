IIO: BME280: Updates to Humidity readings need ctrl_reg write!

The ctrl_reg register needs to be written after any write to
the humidity registers. The value written to the ctrl_reg register
does not necessarily need to change, but a write operation must
occur.

The regmap_update_bits functions will not write to a register
if the register value matches the value to be written. This saves
unnecessary bus operations.  The change in this patch forces a bus
write during the chip_config operation by switching to
regmap_write_bits.

This will fix issues where the Humidity Sensor Oversampling bits
are not updated after initialization.
