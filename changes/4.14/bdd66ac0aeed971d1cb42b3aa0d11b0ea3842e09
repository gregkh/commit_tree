net/mlx5e: Disallow TC offloading of unsupported match/action combinations

When offloading header re-write, the HW may need to adjust checksums along
the packet. For IP traffic, and a case where we are asked to modify fields in
the IP header, current HW supports that only for TCP and UDP. Enforce it, in
this case fail the offloading attempt for non TCP/UDP packets.

Fixes: 2f4fe4cab073 ('net/mlx5e: Add offloading of NIC TC pedit (header re-write) actions')
