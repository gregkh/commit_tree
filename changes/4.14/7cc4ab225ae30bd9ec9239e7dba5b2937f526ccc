drm/bridge: dw-hdmi: add better clock disable control

The video setup path aways sets the clock disable register to a specific
value, which has the effect of disabling the CEC engine.  When we add the
CEC driver, this becomes a problem.

Fix this by only setting/clearing the bits that the video path needs to.
