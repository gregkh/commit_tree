mailbox: bcm-flexrm-mailbox: Fix mask used in CMPL_START_ADDR_VALUE()

The mask used in CMPL_START_ADDR_VALUE() should be 27bits instead of
26bits. This incorrect mask was causing completion writes to 40bits
physical address fail.

This patch fixes mask used in CMPL_START_ADDR_VALUE() macro.

Fixes: dbc049eee730 ("mailbox: Add driver for Broadcom FlexRM
ring manager")
