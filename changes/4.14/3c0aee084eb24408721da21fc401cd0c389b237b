ARM: shmobile: defconfig: Replace USB_XHCI_RCAR by USB_XHCI_PLATFORM

USB_XHCI_RCAR is no longer enabled, as it now has a dependency on
USB_XHCI_PLATFORM, instead of selecting USB_XHCI_PLATFORM.
As the latter selects the former if ARCH_RENESAS, fix this by replacing
USB_XHCI_RCAR by USB_XHCI_PLATFORM in shmobile_defconfig.
