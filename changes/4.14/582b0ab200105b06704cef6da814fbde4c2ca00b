scsi: virtio: virtio_scsi: Set can_queue to the length of the virtqueue.

Since switching to blk-mq as the default in commit 5c279bd9e406
("scsi: default to scsi-mq"), virtio-scsi LUNs consume about 10x as
much kernel memory.

qemu currently allocates a fixed 128 entry virtqueue.  can_queue
currently is set to 1024.  But with indirect descriptors, each command
in the queue takes 1 virtqueue entry, so the number of commands which
can be queued is equal to the length of the virtqueue.

Note I intend to send a patch to qemu to allow the virtqueue size to be
configured from the qemu command line.
