dm log writes: don't use all the cpu while waiting to log blocks

The check to see if the logging kthread needs to go to sleep is wrong,
it checks lc->pending_blocks, which will be non-0 if there are any
blocks that are pending, whether they are ready to be logged or not.
What we really want is to go to sleep until it's time to log blocks, so
change this check so we do actually go to sleep in between flushes.
