net/mlx5e: Distribute RSS table among all RX rings

In default, uniformly distribute the RSS indirection table entries
among all RX rings, rather than restricting this only to the rings
on the close NUMA node. irqbalancer would anyway dynamically override
the default affinities set to the RX rings.
This gives better multi-stream performance and CPU util.
