mm, THP, swap: make reuse_swap_page() works for THP swapped out

After supporting to delay THP (Transparent Huge Page) splitting after
swapped out, it is possible that some page table mappings of the THP are
turned into swap entries.  So reuse_swap_page() need to check the swap
count in addition to the map count as before.  This patch done that.

In the huge PMD write protect fault handler, in addition to the page map
count, the swap count need to be checked too, so the page lock need to
be acquired too when calling reuse_swap_page() in addition to the page
table lock.
