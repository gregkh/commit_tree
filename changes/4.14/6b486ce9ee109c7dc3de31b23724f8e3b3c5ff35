scsi: lpfc: Fix bad sgl reposting after 2nd adapter reset

Port issue was fixed, the hbacmd reset would take more than 8 minutes to
complete.

There were conflicting NVME SGL posting/reposting responsibilities
between lpfc_online()/lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() and
lpfc_nvme_create_localport().  The lpfc_online() causes a REPOST on
existing NVME SGLs which is not released during the fc port reset.
However, lpfc_nvme_create_localport() wants to allocate new NVME buffers
and post them. Both cancelled out each other which had a side effect of
hosing the mailbox handling that was used to remove the sgl lists -
causing multiple 60s mbx timeouts.

Fix by preserving all SGL lists over the fc port reset.
