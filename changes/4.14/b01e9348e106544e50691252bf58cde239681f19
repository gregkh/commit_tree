mfd: intel_soc_pmic: Differentiate between Bay and Cherry Trail CRC variants

Both Bay and Cherry Trail devices may be used together with a Crystal Cove
PMIC. Each platform has its own variant of the PMIC, which both use the
same ACPI HID, but they are not 100% compatible.

This commits makes the intel_soc_pmic_core code check the _HRV of the
ACPI-firmware-node and selects intel_soc_pmic_config_byt_crc resp.
intel_soc_pmic_config_cht_crc based on this.

This fixes the Bay Trail specific ACPI OpRegion code causing problems
on Cherry Trail devices. Specifically this was causing the external
microsd slot on a Dell Venue 8 5855 (Cherry Trail version) to not work
and the eMMC to become unreliable and throw lots of errors.
