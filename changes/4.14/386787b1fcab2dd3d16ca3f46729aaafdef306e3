MIPS: Loongson 2F: allow NULL clock for clk_get_rate

Make the behaviour of clk_get_rate consistent with common clk's
clk_get_rate by accepting NULL clocks as parameter, as some device
drivers rely on this.

Make the behaviour of clk_get_rate consistent with common clk's
clk_get_rate by accepting NULL clocks as parameter. Some device
drivers rely on this, and will cause an OOPS otherwise.
