bpf: fix off by one for range markings with L{T, E} patterns

During review I noticed that the current logic for direct packet
access marking in check_cond_jmp_op() has an off by one for the
upper right range border when marking in find_good_pkt_pointers()
with BPF_JLT and BPF_JLE. It's not really harmful given access
up to pkt_end is always safe, but we should nevertheless correct
the range marking before it becomes ABI. If pkt_data' denotes a
pkt_data derived pointer (pkt_data + X), then for pkt_data' < pkt_end
in the true branch as well as for pkt_end <= pkt_data' in the false
branch we mark the range with X although it should really be X - 1
in these cases. For example, X could be pkt_end - pkt_data, then
when testing for pkt_data' < pkt_end the verifier simulation cannot
deduce that a byte load of pkt_data' - 1 would succeed in this
branch.
