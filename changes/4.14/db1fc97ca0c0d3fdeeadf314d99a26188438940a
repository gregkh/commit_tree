dma-buf/sync_file: Allow multiple sync_files to wrap a single dma-fence

Up until recently sync_file were create to export a single dma-fence to
userspace, and so we could canabalise a bit insie dma-fence to mark
whether or not we had enable polling for the sync_file itself. However,
with the advent of syncobj, we do allow userspace to create multiple
sync_files for a single dma-fence. (Similarly, that the sw-sync
validation framework also started returning multiple sync-files wrapping
a single dma-fence for a syncpt also triggering the problem.)

This patch reverts my suggestion in commit e24165537312
("dma-buf/sync_file: only enable fence signalling on poll()") to use a
single bit in the shared dma-fence and restores the sync_file->flags for
tracking the bits individually.
