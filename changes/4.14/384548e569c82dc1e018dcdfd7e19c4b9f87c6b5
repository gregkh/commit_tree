hwmon: (it87) Reapply probe path chip registers settings after resume

After a suspend / resume cycle we possibly need to reapply chip registers
settings that we had set or fixed in a probe path, since they might have
been reset to default values or set incorrectly by a BIOS again.

Tested on a Gigabyte M720-US3 board, which requires routing internal VCCH5V
to in7 (and had it wrong again on resume from S3).
