ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Commonize parsing of format tokens

Format resource tokens can be a part of either the widget or manifest
private data. In the current model, format resources come as a part of
widget private data and they come as a part of topology manifest in the
newly introduced model.

So add a common function that can fill up either of the structures.
