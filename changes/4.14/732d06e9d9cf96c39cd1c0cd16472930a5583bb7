iwlwifi: mvm: add station before allocating a queue

One of the queue config params is the associated station id.
Hence the FW must know about the station prior to the queue allocation.
In a000 devices, allocating a queue without a valid station
results with assert 0x2B00.
In FW restart flow the queues are allocated before
adding the station so first add the station.
