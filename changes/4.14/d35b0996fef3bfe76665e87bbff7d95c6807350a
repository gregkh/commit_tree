dma-coherent: fix dma_declare_coherent_memory() logic error

A recent change interprets the return code of dma_init_coherent_memory
as an error value, but it is instead a boolean, where 'true' indicates
success. This leads causes the caller to always do the wrong thing,
and also triggers a compile-time warning about it:

drivers/base/dma-coherent.c: In function 'dma_declare_coherent_memory':
drivers/base/dma-coherent.c:99:15: error: 'mem' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

I ended up changing the code a little more, to give use the usual
error handling, as this seemed the best way to fix up the warning
and make the code look reasonable at the same time.
