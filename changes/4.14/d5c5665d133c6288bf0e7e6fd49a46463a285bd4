atm: fore200e: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  20025	    320	     16	  20361	   4f89	drivers/atm/fore200e.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  20089	    256	     16	  20361	   4f89	drivers/atm/fore200e.o
