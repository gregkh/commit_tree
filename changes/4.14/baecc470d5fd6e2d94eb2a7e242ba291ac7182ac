PCI / PM: Skip bridges in pci_enable_wake()

PCI bridges only have a reason to generate wakeup signals on behalf
of devices below them, so avoid preparing bridges for wakeup directly
in pci_enable_wake().

Also drop the pci_has_subordinate() check from pci_pm_default_resume()
as this will be done by pci_enable_wake() itself now.
