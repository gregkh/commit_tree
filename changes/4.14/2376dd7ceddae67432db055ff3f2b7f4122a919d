userfaultfd: call userfaultfd_unmap_prep only if __split_vma succeeds

A __split_vma is not a worthy event to report, and it's definitely not a
unmap so it would be incorrect to report unmap for the whole region to
the userfaultfd manager if a __split_vma fails.

So only call userfaultfd_unmap_prep after the __vma_splitting is over
and do_munmap cannot fail anymore.

Also add unlikely because it's better to optimize for the vast majority
of apps that aren't using userfaultfd in a non cooperative way.  Ideally
we should also find a way to eliminate the branch entirely if
CONFIG_USERFAULTFD=n, but it would complicate things so stick to
unlikely for now.
