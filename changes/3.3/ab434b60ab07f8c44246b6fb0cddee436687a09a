ceph: initialize client debugfs outside of monc->mutex

Initializing debufs under monc->mutex introduces a lock dependency for
sb->s_type->i_mutex_key, which (combined with several other dependencies)
leads to an annoying lockdep warning.  There's no particular reason to do
the debugfs setup under this lock, so move it out.

It used to be the case that our first monmap could come from the OSD; that
is no longer the case with recent servers, so we will reliably set up the
client entry during the initial authentication.

We don't have to worry about racing with debugfs teardown by
ceph_debugfs_client_cleanup() because ceph_destroy_client() calls
ceph_msgr_flush() first, which will wait for the message dispatch work
to complete (and the debugfs init to complete).
