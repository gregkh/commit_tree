target: Allow control CDBs with data > 1 page

We need to handle >1 page control cdbs, so extend the code to do a vmap
if bigger than 1 page. It seems like kmap() is still preferable if just
a page, fewer TLB shootdowns(?), so keep using that when possible.

Rename function pair for their new scope.
