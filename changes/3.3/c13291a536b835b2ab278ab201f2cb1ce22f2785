bootmem: Use for_each_mem_pfn_range() in page_alloc.c

The previous patch added for_each_mem_pfn_range() which is more
versatile than for_each_active_range_index_in_nid().  This patch
replaces for_each_active_range_index_in_nid() and open coded
early_node_map[] walks with for_each_mem_pfn_range().

All conversions in this patch are straight-forward and shouldn't cause
any functional difference.  After the conversions,
for_each_active_range_index_in_nid() doesn't have any user left and is
removed.
