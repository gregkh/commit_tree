Btrfs: implement online profile changing

Profile changing is done by launching a balance with
BTRFS_BALANCE_CONVERT bits set and target fields of respective
btrfs_balance_args structs initialized.  Profile reducing code in this
case will pick restriper's target profile if it's available instead of
doing a blind reduce.  If target profile is not yet available it goes
back to a plain reduce.
