iwlagn: fix NULL ptr deref when reprogramming sta w/o LQ

Reinette reports a crash in iwl_reprogram_ap_sta(). The
debugging shows:

  b1 16    mov    $0x16,%cl
 *f3 a5    rep movsl %ds     <-- trapping instruction:(%rsi),%es:(%rdi)

which is a memcpy of 22 (0x16) words (movsl). this points
to "priv->stations[sta_id].lq" being NULL since that is
the memcpy() of that size here.

The only way I see for this to happen is if we try to
do some RXON reprogramming while connecting to an AP,
after tx_sync() but before full setup, but that seems
like something that might very well happen.

Fix this by checking if the LQ is present and only then
reprogramming it.
