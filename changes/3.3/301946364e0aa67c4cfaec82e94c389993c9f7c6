md/raid1:  Replace use of mddev->raid_disks with conf->raid_disks.

In general mddev->raid_disks can change unexpectedly while
conf->raid_disks will only change in a very controlled way.  So change
some uses of one to the other.

The use of mddev->raid_disks will not cause actually problems but
this way is more consistent and safer in the long term.
