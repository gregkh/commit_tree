serial: amba-pl011: lock console writes against interrupts

Protect against pl011_console_write() and the interrupt for
the console UART running concurrently on different CPUs.

Otherwise the console_write could spin for a long time
waiting for the UART to become not busy, while the other
CPU continuously services UART interrupts and keeps the
UART busy.

The checks for sysrq and oops_in_progress are taken
from 8250.c.
