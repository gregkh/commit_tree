net: remove NETIF_F_NO_CSUM feature bit

Only distinct use is checking if NETIF_F_NOCACHE_COPY should be
enabled by default. The check heuristics is altered a bit here,
so it hits other people than before. The default shouldn't be
trusted for performance-critical cases anyway.

For all other uses NETIF_F_NO_CSUM is equivalent to NETIF_F_HW_CSUM.
