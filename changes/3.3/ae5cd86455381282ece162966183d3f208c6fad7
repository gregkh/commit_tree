x86/PCI: Ignore CPU non-addressable _CRS reserved memory resources

This assures that a _CRS reserved host bridge window or window region is
not used if it is not addressable by the CPU.  The new code either trims
the window to exclude the non-addressable portion or totally ignores the
window if the entire window is non-addressable.

The current code has been shown to be problematic with 32-bit non-PAE
kernels on systems where _CRS reserves resources above 4GB.
