md: notify the 'degraded' sysfs attribute on failure.

We currently only 'notify' changes to the 'degraded' attribute
when it decreases, not when it increases.

Notifying on failure is a little awkward as it happen in
interrupt context.
So instead, notify when we remove the failed device from the array,
which is very soon afterwards.
