mlx4: Ethernet port management modifications

The physical port is now common to the PF and VFs.
The port resources and configuration is managed by the PF, VFs can
only influence the MTU of the port, it is set as max among all functions,
Each function allocates RX buffers of required size to meet it's MTU enforcement.
Port management code was moved to mlx4_core, as the mlx4_en module is
virtualization unaware

Move handling qp functionality to mlx4_get_eth_qp/mlx4_put_eth_qp
including reserve/release range and add/release unicast steering.
Let mlx4_register/unregister_mac deal only with MAC (un)registration.
