regmap: Track if the register cache is dirty and suppress unneeded syncs

Allow drivers to optimise out the register cache sync if they didn't need
to do one. If the hardware is desynced from the register cache (by power
loss for example) then the driver should call regcache_mark_dirty() to
let the core know about this.
