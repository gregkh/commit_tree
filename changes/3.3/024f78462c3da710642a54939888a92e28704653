cpu: Do not return errors from cpu_dev_init() which will be ignored

cpu_dev_init() is only called from driver_init(), which does not check
its return value.  Therefore make cpu_dev_init() return void.

We must register the CPU subsystem, so panic if this fails.

If sched_create_sysfs_power_savings_entries() fails, the damage is
contained, so ignore this (as before).
