ALSA: hda - Fix silent output on ASUS A6Rp

The refactoring of Realtek codec driver in 3.2 kernel caused a
regression for ASUS A6Rp laptop; it doesn't give any output.
The reason was that this machine has a secret master mute (or EAPD)
control via NID 0x0f VREF.  Setting VREF50 on this node makes the
sound working again.
