vfs: cache request_queue in struct block_device

This makes it possible to get from the inode to the request_queue with one
less cache miss.  Used in followon optimization.

The livetime of the pointer is the same as the gendisk.

This assumes that the queue will always stay the same in the gendisk while
it's visible to block_devices.  I think that's safe correct?
