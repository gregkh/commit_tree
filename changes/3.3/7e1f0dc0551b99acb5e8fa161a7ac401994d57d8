mtd: introduce mtd_erase interface

This patch is part of a patch-set which changes the MTD interface
from 'mtd->func()' form to 'mtd_func()' form. We need this because
we want to add common code to to all drivers in the mtd core level,
which is impossible with the current interface when MTD clients
call driver functions like 'read()' or 'write()' directly.

At this point we just introduce a new inline wrapper function, but
later some of them are expected to gain more code. E.g., the input
parameters check should be moved to the wrappers rather than be
duplicated at many drivers.

This particular patch introduced the 'mtd_erase()' interface. The
following patches add all the other interfaces one by one.
