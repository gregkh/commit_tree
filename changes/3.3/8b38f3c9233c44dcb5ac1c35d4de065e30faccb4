m68k: use tracehook_report_syscall_entry/exit for ColdFire MMU ptrace path

The existing ColdFire code (which is all non-mmu) for system call entry
and exit uses the more modern tracehook_report_syscall_entry()/exit()
into the ptrace code. Now that we are supporting ColdFire with MMU we
need the same hooks for these.
