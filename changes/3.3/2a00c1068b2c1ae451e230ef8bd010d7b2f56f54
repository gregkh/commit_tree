msm: timer: Remove msm_clocks[] and simplify code

We can simplify the timer code now that we only use the DGT for
the clocksource and the GPT for the clockevent. Get rid of the
msm_clocks[] array and propagate the changes throughout the code.
This reduces the lines of code in this file and improves
readability.
