[media] drxk: Switch the delivery system on FE_SET_PROPERTY

The DRX-K doesn't change the delivery system at set_properties,
but do it at frontend init. This causes problems on programs like
w_scan that, by default, opens both frontends.

Instead, explicitly set the format when set_parameters callback is
called.
