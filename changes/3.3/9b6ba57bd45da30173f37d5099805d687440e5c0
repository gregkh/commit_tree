[media] DVB: dib0700, move Nova-TD Stick to a separate set

To properly support the three LEDs which are on the stick, we need
a special handling in the ->frontend_attach function. Thus let's have
a separate ->frontend_attach instead of ifs in the common one.

The hadnling itself will be added in further patches.
