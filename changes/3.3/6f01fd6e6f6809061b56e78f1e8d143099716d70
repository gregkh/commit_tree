af_unix: fix EPOLLET regression for stream sockets

Commit 0884d7aa24 (AF_UNIX: Fix poll blocking problem when reading from
a stream socket) added a regression for epoll() in Edge Triggered mode
(EPOLLET)

Appropriate fix is to use skb_peek()/skb_unlink() instead of
skb_dequeue(), and only call skb_unlink() when skb is fully consumed.

This remove the need to requeue a partial skb into sk_receive_queue head
and the extra sk->sk_data_ready() calls that added the regression.

This is safe because once skb is given to sk_receive_queue, it is not
modified by a writer, and readers are serialized by u->readlock mutex.

This also reduce number of spinlock acquisition for small reads or
MSG_PEEK users so should improve overall performance.
