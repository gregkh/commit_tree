fsnotify: don't BUG in fsnotify_destroy_mark()

Removing the parent of a watched file results in "kernel BUG at
fs/notify/mark.c:139".

To reproduce

  add "-w /tmp/audit/dir/watched_file" to audit.rules
  rm -rf /tmp/audit/dir

This is caused by fsnotify_destroy_mark() being called without an
extra reference taken by the caller.

Reported by Francesco Cosoleto here:

  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689860

Fix by removing the BUG_ON and adding a comment about not accessing mark after
the iput.
