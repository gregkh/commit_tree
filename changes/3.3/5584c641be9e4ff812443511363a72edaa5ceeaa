[media] dm1105: handle errors from dvb_net_init

Clean up and error out if dvb_net_init fails (for example due to
ENOMEM).  This involves moving the dvb_net_init call to before
frontend_init to make cleaning up a little easier.

From an audit of dvb_net_init callers, now that dvb_net_init lets
callers know about errors.
