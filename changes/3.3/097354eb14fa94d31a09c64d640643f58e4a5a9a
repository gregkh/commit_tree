drm/i915: check ACTHD of all rings

Otherwise hangcheck spuriously fires when running blitter/bsd-only
workloads.

Contrary to a similar patch by Ben Widawsky this does not check
INSTDONE of the other rings. Chris Wilson implied that in a failure to
detect a hang, most likely because INSTDONE was fluctuating. Thus only
check ACTHD, which as far as I know is rather reliable. Also, blitter
and bsd rings can't launch complex tasks from a single instruction
(like 3D_PRIM on the render with complex or even infinite shaders).

This fixes spurious gpu hang detection when running
tests/gem_hangcheck_forcewake on snb/ivb.
