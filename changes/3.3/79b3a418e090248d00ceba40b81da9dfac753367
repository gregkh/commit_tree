crypto: talitos - add hmac algorithms

Add these hmac algorithms to talitos:
    hmac(md5),
    hmac(sha1),
    hmac(sha224),
    hmac(sha256),
    hmac(sha384),
    hmac(sha512).
These are all type ahash.

Fixed up to not register HMAC algorithms on sec2.0 devices.
Rationale (from Lee):

on an 8349E Rev1.1, there's a problem with hmac for any talitos
hmac sequence requiring an intermediate hash context (Pointer
DWORD 1); the result is an incorrect hmac.  An intermediate hash
context is required for something longer than (65536-blocksize),
and for other cases when update/finup/final are used inefficiently.
Interestingly, a normal hash (without hmac) works perfectly
when using an intermediate context.
