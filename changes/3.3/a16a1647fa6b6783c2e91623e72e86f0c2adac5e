netfilter: ctnetlink: fix race between delete and timeout expiration

Kerin Millar reported hardlockups while running `conntrackd -c'
in a busy firewall. That system (with several processors) was
acting as backup in a primary-backup setup.

After several tries, I found a race condition between the deletion
operation of ctnetlink and timeout expiration. This patch fixes
this problem.
