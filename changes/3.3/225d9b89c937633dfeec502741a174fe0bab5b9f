sch_sfq: rehash queues in perturb timer

A known Out Of Order (OOO) problem hurts SFQ when timer changes
perturbation value, since all new packets delivered to SFQ enqueue might
end on different slots than previous in-flight packets.

With round robin delivery, we can thus deliver packets in a different
order.

Since SFQ is limited to small amount of in-flight packets, we can rehash
packets so that this OOO problem is fixed.

This rehashing is performed only if internal flow classifier is in use.

We now store in skb->cb[] the "struct flow_keys" so that we dont call
skb_flow_dissect() again while rehashing.
