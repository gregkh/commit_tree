mm, x86: Remove debug_pagealloc_enabled

When (no)bootmem finish operation, it pass pages to buddy
allocator. Since debug_pagealloc_enabled is not set, we will do
not protect pages, what is not what we want with
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y.

To fix remove debug_pagealloc_enabled. That variable was
introduced by commit 12d6f21e "x86: do not PSE on
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y" to get more CPA (change page
attribude) code testing. But currently we have CONFIG_CPA_DEBUG,
which test CPA.
