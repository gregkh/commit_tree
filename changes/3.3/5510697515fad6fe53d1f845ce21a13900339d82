iwlagn: remove unnecessary type for tracing operations

The device tracing routines only use the priv pointer as an opaque
value.  Change from a typed iwl_priv pointer to a null pointer and
eliminate the need to include iwl_priv.h.  CMD_ASYNC is defined in
iwl_shared.h which is the only reason it is included.
