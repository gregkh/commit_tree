xfs: use a normal shrinker for the dquot freelist

Stop reusing dquots from the freelist when allocating new ones directly, and
implement a shrinker that actually follows the specifications for the
interface.  The shrinker implementation is still highly suboptimal at this
point, but we can gradually work on it.

This also fixes an bug in the previous lock ordering, where we would take
the hash and dqlist locks inside of the freelist lock against the normal
lock ordering.  This is only solvable by introducing the dispose list,
and thus not when using direct reclaim of unused dquots for new allocations.

As a side-effect the quota upper bound and used to free ratio values in
/proc/fs/xfs/xqm are set to 0 as these values don't make any sense in the
new world order.
