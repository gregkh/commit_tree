[media] smsusb: fix the default delivery system setting

There are two issues on the default delivery system setting for smsusb:

	1) instead of filling the delivery system for the per-client
	   frontend.ops, it were changing the global structure;

	2) The client->frontend.ops copy were keeping the previous value
	   of the template. So, the first time the device was inserted,
	   it was using the wrong value.
