xfs: pass KM_SLEEP flag to kmem_realloc() in xlog_recover_add_to_cnt_trans()

The kmem_realloc() in xfs is given KM_* memory allocation flags. And it
allocates memory using kmalloc() after they are converted to gfp_mask
flags. In xlog_recover_add_to_cont_trans(), 0u is passed to kmem_realloc(),
instead of them. I guess it is preferred to use them, and here memory must
be allocated but don't have to be done with GFP_ATOMIC. So, this patch
changes it to KM_SLEEP.
