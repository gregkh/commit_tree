ath9k_hw: Add MCI related changes in chip reset

here we check for BT state and if BT calibration has started,
give 25ms for BT Calibration to finish. we also take care of 2G/5G
switch and LNA transfer incase WLAN is operating in 5G. in case the BT
state is awake when we do WLAN calibration re-calibrate and we reset
the message exchange between WLAN and BT. BT is given preference when
simultaneous CAL request happens. calibration for WLAN/BT is done
assuming that the other co-existing module is in awake state, if not
we continue to do calibration while if the other module's state changes
we need to do restart the calibration handshake
