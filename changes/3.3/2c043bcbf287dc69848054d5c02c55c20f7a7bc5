regulator: pass additional of_node to regulator_register()

With device tree support for regulators, its needed that the
regulator_dev->dev device has the right of_node attached.
To be able to do this add an additional parameter to the
regulator_register() api, wherein the dt-adapted driver can
then pass this additional info onto the regulator core.
