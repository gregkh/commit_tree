ftrace: Replace record newlist with record page list

As new functions come in to be initalized from mcount to nop,
they are done by groups of pages. Whether it is the core kernel
or a module. There's no need to keep track of these on a per record
basis.

At startup, and as any module is loaded, the functions to be
traced are stored in a group of pages and added to the function
list at the end. We just need to keep a pointer to the first
page of the list that was added, and use that to know where to
start on the list for initializing functions.
