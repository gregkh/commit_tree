USB: Add optional match for interface class to dynamic ID facility

When adding the ID of a composite device dynamically to a driver, all
hitherto unbound interfaces are bound to this driver regardless of their
class, which may not be intended.
The patch adds the option to tell the targeted interface class to a driver
via the "new_id" attribute, in addition to the device ID.
Also, it appends the ABI documentation accordingly.

Example:
$ echo "1234 2a2a ff" >/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id
will bind only vendor-specific interfaces to the 3G driver.
