ALSA: hda - Add a fake mute feature

Some codecs don't supply the mute amp-capabilities although the lowest
volume gives the mute.  It'd be handy if the parser provides the mute
mixers in such a case.

This patch adds an extension amp-cap bit (which is used only in the
driver) to represent the min volume = mute state.  Also modified the
amp cache code to support the fake mute feature when this bit is set
but the real mute bit is unset.

In addition, conexant cx5051 parser uses this new feature to implement
the missing mute controls.
