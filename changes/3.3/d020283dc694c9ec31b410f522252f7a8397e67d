PM / QoS: CPU C-state breakage with PM Qos change

Looks like change "PM QoS: Move and rename the implementation files"
merged during the 3.2 development cycle made PM QoS depend on
CONFIG_PM which depends on (PM_SLEEP || PM_RUNTIME).

That breaks CPU C-states with kernels not having these CONFIGs, causing CPUs
to spend time in Polling loop idle instead of going into deep C-states,
consuming way way more power. This is with either acpi idle or intel idle
enabled.

Either CONFIG_PM should be enabled with any pm_qos users or
the !CONFIG_PM pm_qos_request() should return sane defaults not to break
the existing users. Here's is the patch for the latter option.

[rjw: Modified the changelog slightly.]
