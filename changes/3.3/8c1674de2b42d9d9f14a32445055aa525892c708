powerpc: Fix booke hugetlb preload code for PPC_MM_SLICES and 64-bit

This patch does 2 things: It corrects the code that determines the
size to write into MAS1 for the PPC_MM_SLICES case (this originally
came from David Gibson and I had incorrectly altered it), and it
changes the methodolody used to calculate the size for !PPC_MM_SLICES
to work for 64-bit as well as 32-bit.
