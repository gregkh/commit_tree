tcp: use DSACKs that arrive when packets_out is 0

The bug: Senders ignored DSACKs after recovery when there were no
outstanding packets (a common scenario for HTTP servers).

The change: when there are no outstanding packets (the "no_queue" goto
label), call tcp_fastretrans_alert() in order to use DSACKs to undo
congestion window reductions.

Other patches in this series will provide other changes that are
necessary to fully fix this problem.
