MIPS: fault.c: Port OOM changes to do_page_fault

Commit d065bd810b6deb67d4897a14bfe21f8eb526ba99
(mm: retry page fault when blocking on disk transfer) and
commit 37b23e0525d393d48a7d59f870b3bc061a30ccdb
(x86,mm: make pagefault killable)

The above commits introduced changes into the x86 pagefault handler
for making the page fault handler retryable as well as killable.

These changes reduce the mmap_sem hold time, which is crucial
during OOM killer invocation.

Port these changes to MIPS.

Without these changes, my MIPS board encounters many hang and livelock
scenarios.
After applying this patch, OOM feature performance improves according to
my testing.
