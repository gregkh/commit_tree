powerpc: Rename mapping based RELOCATABLE to DYNAMIC_MEMSTART for BookE

The current implementation of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE in BookE is based
on mapping the page aligned kernel load address to KERNELBASE. This
approach however is not enough for platforms, where the TLB page size
is large (e.g, 256M on 44x). So we are renaming the RELOCATABLE used
currently in BookE to DYNAMIC_MEMSTART to reflect the actual method.

The CONFIG_RELOCATABLE for PPC32(BookE) based on processing of the
dynamic relocations will be introduced in the later in the patch series.

This change would allow the use of the old method of RELOCATABLE for
platforms which can afford to enforce the page alignment (platforms with
smaller TLB size).

Changes since v3:

* Introduced a new config, NONSTATIC_KERNEL, to denote a kernel which is
  either a RELOCATABLE or DYNAMIC_MEMSTART(Suggested by: Josh Boyer)
