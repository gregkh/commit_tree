Revert "drivers: usb: Fix dependency for USB_HWA_HCD"

This reverts commit 0dd2b62ada6f911fbd13e98e98f57f4edc42c604.

It causes a bunch of Kconfig errors:

drivers/usb/host/Kconfig:559:error: recursive dependency detected!
drivers/usb/host/Kconfig:559:	symbol USB_HWA_HCD depends on UWB
drivers/uwb/Kconfig:5:	symbol UWB is selected by USB_WUSB
drivers/usb/wusbcore/Kconfig:4:	symbol USB_WUSB is selected by USB_HWA_HCD

showing that this really wasn't the correct fix at all.
