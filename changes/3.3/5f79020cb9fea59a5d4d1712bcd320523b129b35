kmemleak: Show where early_log issues come from

Based on initial patch by Steven Rostedt.

Early kmemleak warnings did not show where the actual kmemleak API had
been called from but rather just a backtrace to the kmemleak_init()
function. By having all early kmemleak logs record the stack_trace, we
can have kmemleak_init() write exactly where the problem occurred. This
patch adds the setting of the kmemleak_warning variable every time a
kmemleak warning is issued. The kmemleak_init() function checks this
variable during early log replaying and prints the log trace if there
was any warning.
