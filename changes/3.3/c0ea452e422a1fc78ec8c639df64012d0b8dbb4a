bnx2x: fix memory leak in bnx2x_init_firmware()

When cycling the interface down and up, bnx2x_init_firmware() knows that
the firmware is already loaded, but nevertheless it allocates certain
arrays anew (init_data, init_ops, init_ops_offsets, iro_arr). The old
arrays are leaked.

Fix the leaks by returning early if the firmware was already loaded.
Because if the firmware is loaded, so are the arrays.
