[SCSI] hpsa: Add IRQF_SHARED back in for the non-MSI(X) interrupt handler

IRQF_SHARED is required for older controllers that don't support MSI(X)
and which may end up sharing an interrupt.  All the controllers hpsa
normally supports have MSI(X) capability, but older controllers may be
encountered via the hpsa_allow_any=1 module parameter.

Also remove deprecated IRQF_DISABLED.
