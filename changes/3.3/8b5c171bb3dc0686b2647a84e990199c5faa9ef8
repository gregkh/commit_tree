Ouch, this was fixed on one machine yesterday, but not the other one I
used this morning, sorry.

[PATCH V5 net-next] neigh: new unresolved queue limits

unres_qlen is the number of frames we are able to queue per unresolved
neighbour. Its default value (3) was never changed and is responsible
for strange drops, especially if IP fragments are used, or multiple
sessions start in parallel. Even a single tcp flow can hit this limit.

$ arp -d 192.168.20.108 ; ping -c 2 -s 8000 192.168.20.108
PING 192.168.20.108 (192.168.20.108) 8000(8028) bytes of data.
8008 bytes from 192.168.20.108: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.322 ms
