bnx2x: fix crash while ethtool -t

commit 2df1a70aaf70e8dff11b89b938a5f317556ee640  "bnx2x: Support
for byte queue limits" has introduced an asymmetry in usage of
netdev_tx_completed_queue and netdev_tx_sent_queue. Missing
call to netdev_tx_sent_queue causes the crash during ethtool -t.

The patch adds the missing call.
