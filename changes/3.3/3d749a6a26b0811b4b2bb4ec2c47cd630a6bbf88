tipc: Hide media-specific addressing details from generic bearer code

Reworks TIPC's media address data structure and associated processing
routines to transfer all media-specific details of address conversion
to the associated TIPC media adaptation code. TIPC's generic bearer code
now only needs to know which media type an address is associated with
and whether or not it is a broadcast address, and totally ignores the
"value" field that contains the actual media-specific addressing info.

These changes eliminate the need for a number of endianness conversion
operations and will make it easier for TIPC to support new media types
in the future.
