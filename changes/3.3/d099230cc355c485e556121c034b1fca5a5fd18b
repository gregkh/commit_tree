nouveau: Support Optimus models for vga_switcheroo

Newer nVidia cards with Optimus do not support/use the DSM switching functions.
Instead, it require a DSM function to be called prior to bringing a device into
D3 state. No other _DSM calls are necessary before/after enabling/disabling a
device. Switching between discrete and integrated GPU is not supported by
this Optimus _DSM call, therefore return on the switching method.
