arch/x86/kernel/e820.c: Eliminate bubble sort from sanitize_e820_map()

Replace the bubble sort in sanitize_e820_map() with a call to
the generic kernel sort function to avoid pathological
performance with large maps.

On large (thousands of entries) E820 maps, the previous code
took minutes to run; with this change it's now milliseconds.
