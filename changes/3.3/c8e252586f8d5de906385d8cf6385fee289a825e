regset: Prevent null pointer reference on readonly regsets

The regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets would always
have .get and .set methods, but not necessarily .active methods.
Unfortunately people have since written regsets without .set methods.

Rather than putting in stub functions everywhere, handle regsets with
null .get or .set methods explicitly.
