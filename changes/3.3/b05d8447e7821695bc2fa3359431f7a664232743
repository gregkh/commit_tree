audit: inline audit_syscall_entry to reduce burden on archs

Every arch calls:

if (unlikely(current->audit_context))
	audit_syscall_entry()

which requires knowledge about audit (the existance of audit_context) in
the arch code.  Just do it all in static inline in audit.h so that arch's
can remain blissfully ignorant.
