arm/dt: tegra: Fix I2C nodes to match board files

With board files, all I2C busses run at 400KHz. Fix the device-tree
to be consistent with this. It's possible this is incorrect, but at
least it keeps the board files and device-tree consistent.

Also, disable any I2C controllers that the board files don't register,
also for consistency.
