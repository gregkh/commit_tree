ceph: create a new session lock to avoid lock inversion

Lockdep was reporting a possible circular lock dependency in
dentry_lease_is_valid().  That function needs to sample the
session's s_cap_gen and and s_cap_ttl fields coherently, but needs
to do so while holding a dentry lock.  The s_cap_lock field was
being used to protect the two fields, but that can't be taken while
holding a lock on a dentry within the session.

In most cases, the s_cap_gen and s_cap_ttl fields only get operated
on separately.  But in three cases they need to be updated together.
Implement a new lock to protect the spots updating both fields
atomically is required.
