checkpatch: fix 'return is not a function' square bracket handling

We are incorrectly matching square brackets '[' and ']' leading to false
positives on more complex functions as below:

    return (dt3155_fbuffer[m]->ready_head -
	dt3155_fbuffer[m]->ready_len +
	dt3155_fbuffer[m]->nbuffers)%
	(dt3155_fbuffer[m]->nbuffers);
