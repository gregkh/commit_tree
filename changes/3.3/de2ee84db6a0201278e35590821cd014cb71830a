mac80211: fix scan state machine

when we run high bandwidth UDP traffic and we trigger a scan, the scan
state machine seems to be looping in SUSPEND->RESUME->DECISION->SUSPEND
and SET_CHANNEL seems to be never called as 'tx_empty' is never true
while running UDP traffic. fix this by settting SET_CHANNEL state when
we get into RESUME state.
