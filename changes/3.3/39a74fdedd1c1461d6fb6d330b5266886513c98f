intel_idle: fix API misuse

smp_call_function() only lets all other CPUs execute a specific function,
while we expect all CPUs do in intel_idle.  Without the fix, we could have
one cpu which has auto_demotion enabled or has no broadcast timer setup.
Usually we don't see impact because auto demotion just harms power and the
intel_idle init is called in CPU 0, where boradcast timer delivers
interrupt, but this still could be a problem.
