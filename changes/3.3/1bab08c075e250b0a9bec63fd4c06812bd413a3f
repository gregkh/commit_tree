drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c: fix KDFONTOP 32bit compatibility layer

KDFONTOP(GET) currently fails with EIO when being run in a 32bit userland
with a 64bit kernel if the font width is not 8.

This is because the compatibility layer introduced by e9216651 ("tty:
handle VT specific compat ioctls in vt driver") forces the addition of the
KD_FONT_FLAG_OLD flag, which makes con_font_get return EIO in such case.

This flag should *not* be set for KDFONTOP, since it's actually the whole
point of this flag (see comment in con_font_set for instance).
