md/raid5: remove redundant bio initialisations.

We current initialise some fields of a bio when preparing a
stripe_head, and again just before submitting the request.

Remove the duplication by only setting the fields that lower level
devices don't touch in raid5_build_block, and only set the changeable
fields in ops_run_io.
