wl12xx: configure probe-resp template according to notification

When operating in AP-mode, replace our probe-response template when a
notification is recieved from mac80211. We preserve the "legacy" way of
configuring a probe-response according to beacon for IBSS mode and for
versions of hostapd that do not support this feature.
