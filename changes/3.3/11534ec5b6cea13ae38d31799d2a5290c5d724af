sched: Remove cfs bandwidth period check in tg_set_cfs_period()

Remove cfs bandwidth period check from tg_set_cfs_period.
Invalid bandwidth period's lower/upper limits are denoted
by min_cfs_quota_period/max_cfs_quota_period repsectively,
and are checked against valid period in tg_set_cfs_bandwidth().

As pjt pointed out, negative input will result in very large unsigned
numbers and will be caught by the max allowed period test.
