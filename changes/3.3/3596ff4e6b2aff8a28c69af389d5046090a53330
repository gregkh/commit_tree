x86: Call do_notify_resume() with interrupts enabled

do_notify_resume() gets called with interrupts disabled on x86_32. This
is different from the x86_64 behavior, where interrupts are enabled at
the time.

Queries on lkml on this issue hasn't yielded any clear answer. Lets make
x86_32 behave the same as x86_64, unless there is a real reason to
maintain status quo.

Please refer https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/27/130 for more
details.

A similar change was suggested in ARM:

My 32-bit machine works fine (tm) with this patch.
