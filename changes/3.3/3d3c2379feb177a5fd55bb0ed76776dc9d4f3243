block, cfq: move icq cache management to block core

Let elevators set ->icq_size and ->icq_align in elevator_type and
elv_register() and elv_unregister() respectively create and destroy
kmem_cache for icq.

* elv_register() now can return failure.  All callers updated.

* icq caches are automatically named "ELVNAME_io_cq".

* cfq_slab_setup/kill() are collapsed into cfq_init/exit().

* While at it, minor indentation change for iosched_cfq.elevator_name
  for consistency.

This will help moving icq management to block core.  This doesn't
introduce any functional change.
