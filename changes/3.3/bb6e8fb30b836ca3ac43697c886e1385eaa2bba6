arm/tegra: remove __initdata annotation from pinmux tables

Instead of reshuffling what functions in the pinmux paths should be
__init and thus could keep references to __initdata, let's just remove
the annotations for now -- the tables are moving to device tree in the
next version anyway and the whole subsystem is being wired up. We will
go back and re-annotate where appropriate once things settle down.
