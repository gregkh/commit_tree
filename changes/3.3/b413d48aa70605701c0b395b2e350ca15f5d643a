mm-tracepoint: rename page-free events

Rename mm_page_free_direct into mm_page_free and mm_pagevec_free into
mm_page_free_batched

Since v2.6.33-5426-gc475dab the kernel triggers mm_page_free_direct for
all freed pages, not only for directly freed.  So, let's name it properly.
 For pages freed via page-list we also trigger mm_page_free_batched event.
