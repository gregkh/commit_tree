DMA: PL330: move filter function into driver

The dma channel selection filter function is moved from plat-samsung
into the pl330 driver. In additon to that, a check is added in the
filter function to ensure that the channel on which the filter has
been invoked is pl330 channel instance (and avoid any incorrect
access of chan->private in a system with multiple types of DMA
drivers).
