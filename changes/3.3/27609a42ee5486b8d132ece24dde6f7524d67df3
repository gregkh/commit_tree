powerpc: Whitespace/comment changes to tlb_low_64e.S

I happened to comment this code while I was digging through it;
we might as well commit that.  I also made some whitespace
changes - the existing code had a lot of unnecessary newlines
that I found annoying when I was working on my tiny laptop.

No functional changes.
