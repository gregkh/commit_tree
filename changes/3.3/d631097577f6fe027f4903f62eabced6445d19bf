tracing: fix event_subsystem ref counting

Fix a bug introduced by e9dbfae5, which prevents event_subsystem from
ever being released.

Ref_count was added to keep track of subsystem users, not for counting
events.  Subsystem is created with ref_count = 1, so there is no need to
increment it for every event, we have nr_events for that.  Fix this by
touching ref_count only when we actually have a new user -
subsystem_open().
