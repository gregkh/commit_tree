x86/mce/AMD: Fix UP build error

141168c36cde ("x86: Simplify code by removing a !SMP #ifdefs
from 'struct cpuinfo_x86'") removed a bunch of CONFIG_SMP ifdefs
around code touching struct cpuinfo_x86 members but also caused
the following build error with Randy's randconfigs:

mce_amd.c:(.cpuinit.text+0x4723): undefined reference to `cpu_llc_shared_map'

Restore the #ifdef in threshold_create_bank() which creates
symlinks on the non-BSP CPUs.

There's a better patch series being worked on by Kevin Winchester
which will solve this in a cleaner fashion, but that series is
too ambitious for v3.3 merging - so we first queue up this trivial
fix and then do the rest for v3.4.
