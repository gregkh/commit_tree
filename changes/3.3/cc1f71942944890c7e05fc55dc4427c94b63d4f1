drm: introduce drm_can_sleep and use in intel/radeon drivers. (v2)

So we have a few places where the drm drivers would like to sleep to
be nice to the system, mainly in the modesetting paths, but we also
have two cases were atomic modesetting must take place, panic writing
and kernel debugger. So provide a central inline to determine if a
sleep or delay should be used and use this in the intel and radeon drivers.

v2: drop intel_drv.h MSLEEP macro, nobody uses it.
