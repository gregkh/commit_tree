arm/dt: tegra: Fix SDHCI nodes to match board files

Mark any SDHCI controllers that aren't registered by the board files as
disabled in the device-tree files.

In practice, these controllers:

* Have nothing hooked up to them at all, or
* For ports intended for SDIO usage, the drivers for anything that might
  be attached are not in the device-tree yet. If/when drivers appear, the
  SD/MMC port can be re-enabled.

The only possible exception is TrimSlice's mico SD slot, but that wasn't
enabled in the board files before anyway, and doesn't work when all the
SDHCI controllers are enabled anyway.
