xfs: remove xfs_itruncate_data

This wrapper isn't overly useful, not to say rather confusing.

Around the call to xfs_itruncate_extents it does:

 - add tracing
 - add a few asserts in debug builds
 - conditionally update the inode size in two places
 - log the inode

Both the tracing and the inode logging can be moved to xfs_itruncate_extents
as they are useful for the attribute fork as well - in fact the attr code
already does an equivalent xfs_trans_log_inode call just after calling
xfs_itruncate_extents.  The conditional size updates are a mess, and there
was no reason to do them in two places anyway, as the first one was
conditional on the inode having extents - but without extents we
xfs_itruncate_extents would be a no-op and the placement wouldn't matter
anyway.  Instead move the size assignments and the asserts that make sense
to the callers that want it.

As a side effect of this clean up xfs_setattr_size by introducing variables
for the old and new inode size, and moving the size updates into a common
place.
