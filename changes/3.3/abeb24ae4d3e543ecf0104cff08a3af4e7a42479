ARM: Make global handler and CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER mutually exclusive

Even when CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER is selected, the core code
requires the arch_irq_handler_default macro to be defined as
a fallback.

It turns out nobody is using that particular feature as both PXA
and shmobile have all their machine descriptors populated with
the interrupt handler, leaving unused code (or empty macros) in
their entry-macro.S file just to be able to compile entry-armv.S.

Make CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER exclusive wrt arch_irq_handler_default,
which allows to remove one test from the hot path. Also cleanup both
PXA and shmobile entry-macro.S.
