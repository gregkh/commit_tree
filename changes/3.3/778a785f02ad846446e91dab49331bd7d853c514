powerpc/pseries/eeh: Fix crash when error happens during device probe

EEH may happen during a PCI driver probe. If the driver is trying to
access some register in a loop, the EEH code will try to print the
driver name. But the driver pointer in struct pci_dev is not set until
probe returns successfully.

Use a function to test if the device and the driver pointer is NULL
before accessing the driver's name.
