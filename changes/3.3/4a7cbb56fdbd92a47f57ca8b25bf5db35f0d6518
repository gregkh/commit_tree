regulator: Fix documentation for of_node parameter of regulator_register()

Commit 5bc75a886353 ("kernel-doc: fix new warning in regulator core")
added documentation for of_node to address a warning but the
documentation didn't explain what the parameter is for so would be
likely to be unhelpful for users.  Clarify that.
