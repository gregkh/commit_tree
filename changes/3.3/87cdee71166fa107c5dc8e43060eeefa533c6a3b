lockdep: Always try to set ->class_cache in register_lock_class() lockdep_init_map()

Commit ["62016250 lockdep: Add improved subclass caching"] tries to
improve performance (expecially to reduce the cost of rq->lock)
when using lockdep, but it fails due to lockdep_init_map() in
which ->class_cache is cleared. The typical caller is
lock_set_subclass(), after that class will not be cached anymore.

This patch tries to achive the goal of commit 62016250 by always
setting ->class_cache in register_lock_class().
