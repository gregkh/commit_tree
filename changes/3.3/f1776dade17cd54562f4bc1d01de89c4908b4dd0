virtio_net: use non-reentrant workqueue.

Michael S. Tsirkin also noticed that we could run the refill work
multiple CPUs: if we kick off a refill on one CPU and then on another,
they would both manipulate the queue at the same time (they use
napi_disable to avoid racing against the receive handler itself).

Tejun points out that this is what the WQ_NON_REENTRANT flag is for,
and that there is a convenient system kthread we can use.
