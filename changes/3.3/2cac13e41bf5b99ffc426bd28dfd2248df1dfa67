Btrfs: fix trim 0 bytes after a device delete

A user reported a bug of btrfs's trim, that is we will trim 0 bytes
after a device delete.

The reproducer:

$ mkfs.btrfs disk1
$ mkfs.btrfs disk2
$ mount disk1 /mnt
$ fstrim -v /mnt
$ btrfs device add disk2 /mnt
$ btrfs device del disk1 /mnt
$ fstrim -v /mnt

This is because after we delete the device, the block group may start from
a non-zero place, which will confuse trim to discard nothing.
