Partial revert "Basic kernel memory functionality for the Memory Controller"

This reverts commit e5671dfae59b165e2adfd4dfbdeab11ac8db5bda.

After a follow up discussion with Michal, it was agreed it would
be better to leave the kmem controller with just the tcp files,
deferring the behavior of the other general memory.kmem.* files
for a later time, when more caches are controlled. This is because
generic kmem files are not used by tcp accounting and it is
not clear how other slab caches would fit into the scheme.

We are reverting the original commit so we can track the reference.
Part of the patch is kept, because it was used by the later tcp
code. Conflicts are shown in the bottom. init/Kconfig is removed from
the revert entirely.
