xen/setup: Remove redundant filtering of PTE masks.

commit 7347b4082e55ac4a673f06a0a0ce25c37273c9ec "xen: Allow
unprivileged Xen domains to create iomap pages" added a redundant
line in the early bootup code to filter out the PTE. That
filtering is already done a bit earlier so this extra processing
is not required.
