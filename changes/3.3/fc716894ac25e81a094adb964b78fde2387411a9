ARM: S3C64XX: Improve logging of unknown Cragganmore module types

As our ID table is populated with hexidecimal values it makes sense to log
unknown module IDs in hexidecimal. It's also helpful to display board
revisions as 1 based rather than 0 based as that's the numbering system
used for the hardware (and what we do when announcing known modules).
