USB: cdc-wdm: better allocate a buffer that is at least as big as we tell the USB core

As it turns out, there was a mismatch between the allocated inbuf size
(desc->bMaxPacketSize0, typically something like 64) and the length we
specified in the URB (desc->wMaxCommand, typically something like 2048)
