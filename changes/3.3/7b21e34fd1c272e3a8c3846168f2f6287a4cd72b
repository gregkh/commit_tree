virtio: harsher barriers for rpmsg.

We were cheating with our barriers; using the smp ones rather than the
real device ones.  That was fine, until rpmsg came along, which is
used to talk to a real device (a non-SMP CPU).

Unfortunately, just putting back the real barriers (reverting
d57ed95d) causes a performance regression on virtio-pci.  In
particular, Amos reports netbench's TCP_RR over virtio_net CPU
utilization increased up to 35% while throughput went down by up to
14%.

By comparison, this branch is in the noise.
