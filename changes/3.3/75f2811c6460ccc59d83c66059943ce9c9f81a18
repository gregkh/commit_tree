ipv6: Add fragment reporting to ipv6_skip_exthdr().

While parsing through IPv6 extension headers, fragment headers are
skipped making them invisible to the caller.  This reports the
fragment offset of the last header in order to make it possible to
determine whether the packet is fragmented and, if so whether it is
a first or last fragment.
