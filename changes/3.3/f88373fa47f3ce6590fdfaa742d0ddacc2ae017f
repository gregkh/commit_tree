ath9k: fix a WEP crypto related regression

commit b4a82a0 "ath9k_hw: fix interpretation of the rx KeyMiss flag"
fixed the interpretation of the KeyMiss flag for keycache based lookups,
however WEP encryption uses a static index, so KeyMiss is always asserted
for it, even though frames are decrypted properly.
Fix this by clearing the ATH9K_RXERR_KEYMISS flag if no keycache based
lookup was performed.
