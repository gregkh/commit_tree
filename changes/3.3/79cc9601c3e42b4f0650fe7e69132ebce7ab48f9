PCI: Only call pci_stop_bus_device() one time for child devices at remove

During debugging pcie hotplug with SRIOV with pcie switch, I found
pci_stop_bus_device() is called several times for some child devices.

So change original pci_remove_bus_device() to __pci_remove_bus_device(),
and make it only do remove work, and add a new pci_remove_bus_device
that calls pci_stop_bus_device() one time, and then call
__pci_remove_bus_device().
