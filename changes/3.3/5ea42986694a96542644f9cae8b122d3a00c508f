xen/blk[front|back]: Enhance discard support with secure erasing support.

Part of the blkdev_issue_discard(xx) operation is that it can also
issue a secure discard operation that will permanantly remove the
sectors in question. We advertise that we can support that via the
'discard-secure' attribute and on the request, if the 'secure' bit
is set, we will attempt to pass in REQ_DISCARD | REQ_SECURE.

[v1: Used 'flag' instead of 'secure:1' bit]
[v2: Use 'reserved' uint8_t instead of adding a new value]
[v3: Check for nseg when mapping instead of operation]
