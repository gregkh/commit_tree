perf script: Implement option for system-wide profiling

The option is documented in man perf-script but was not yet implemented:

       -a
           Force system-wide collection. Scripts run without a
           <command> normally use -a by default, while scripts run
           with a <command> normally don't - this option allows the
           latter to be run in system-wide mode.

As with perf record you now can profile in system-wide mode for the
runtime of a given command, e.g.:

 # perf script -a syscall-counts sleep 2
