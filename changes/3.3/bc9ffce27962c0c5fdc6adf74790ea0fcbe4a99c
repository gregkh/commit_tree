ACPI: Fix possible alignment issues with GAS 'address' references

Generic Address Structures (GAS) may reside within ACPI tables which
are byte aligned.  This patch copies GAS 'address' references to a local
variable, which will be naturally aligned, to be used going forward.

ACPI Generic Address Structure (GAS) reference:
  ACPI Specification, Revision 4.0, Section 5.2.3.1, "Generic Address
  Structure"
