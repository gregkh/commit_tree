cgroup: add cgroup_root_mutex

cgroup wants to make threadgroup stable while modifying cgroup
hierarchies which will introduce locking dependency on
cred_guard_mutex from cgroup_mutex.  This unfortunately completes
circular dependency.

 A. cgroup_mutex -> cred_guard_mutex -> s_type->i_mutex_key -> namespace_sem
 B. namespace_sem -> cgroup_mutex

B is from cgroup_show_options() and this patch breaks it by
introducing another mutex cgroup_root_mutex which nests inside
cgroup_mutex and protects cgroupfs_root.
