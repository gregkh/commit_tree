Bluetooth: Fix mgmt_(block,unblock)_device opcodes

This patch fixes the opcodes of the Block/Unblock device commands to
match with what user-space expects and to confirm with the latest mgmt
specification. The reason the values were wrong was a missing Confirm
Name command definition (which will be added by a subsequent patch).
