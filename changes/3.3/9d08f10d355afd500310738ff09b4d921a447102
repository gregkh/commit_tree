bcma: add set/mask macros for 16-bit register access

The BCMA header only had definitions for 32-bit register access. Used
those as a template for the 16-bit flavour. Also changed them to inline
functions to be on the safe side. As offset parameter is used twice there
would be a problem when used like this: bcma_set32(core, offset++, val);
