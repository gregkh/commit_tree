ARM: 7254/1: restart: S3C24XX: move SWRST based S3C platforms to

S3C2412/S3C2416/S3C2443 use a special register to signal the reset to
the processor and used therefore the s3c24xx_reset_hook mechanism in the
s3c24xx-specific arch reset.

This patch introduces restart functions for these architectures,
moves the board files to them and removes the s3c24xx_reset_hook
infrastructure, as all users are gone.
