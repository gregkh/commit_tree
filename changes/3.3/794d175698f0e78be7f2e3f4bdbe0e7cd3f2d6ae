Bluetooth: hidp: Stop I/O on shutdown

Current hidp driver purges the in/out queue on HID shutdown, but does
not prevent further I/O. If a driver uses hidp_output_raw_report or
hidp_get_raw_report during shutdown, the driver hangs for 5 or 10
seconds per call until it gets a timeout.
That is, if the output queue of an HID driver has 10 messages pending,
it will take 50s until hid_destroy_device() will return. The
hidp_session_sem semaphore is held during shutdown so no other HID
device may be added/removed during this time.

This patch makes hidp_output_raw_report and hidp_get_raw_report fail if
session->terminate is true. Also hidp_session will wakeup all current
calls to these functions to cancel the current operations.

We already purge the current I/O queues on hidp_stop(), so this data loss
does not change the behaviour of the HID drivers.
