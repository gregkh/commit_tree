x86: Fix mmap random address range

On x86_32 casting the unsigned int result of get_random_int() to
long may result in a negative value.  On x86_32 the range of
mmap_rnd() therefore was -255 to 255.  The 32bit mode on x86_64
used 0 to 255 as intended.

The bug was introduced by 675a081 ("x86: unify mmap_{32|64}.c")
in January 2008.
