x86, atomic: atomic64_read() take a const pointer

atomic64_read() doesn't actually write anything (as far as the C
environment is concerned... the CPU does actually write but that's an
implementation quirk), so it should take a const pointer.

This does NOT mean that it is safe to use atomic64_read() on an object
in readonly storage (it will trap!)
