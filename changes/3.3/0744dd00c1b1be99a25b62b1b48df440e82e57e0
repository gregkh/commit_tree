net: introduce skb_flow_dissect()

We use at least two flow dissectors in network stack, with known
limitations and code duplication.

Introduce skb_flow_dissect() to factorize this, highly inspired from
existing dissector from __skb_get_rxhash()

Note : We extensively use skb_header_pointer(), this permits us to not
touch skb at all.
