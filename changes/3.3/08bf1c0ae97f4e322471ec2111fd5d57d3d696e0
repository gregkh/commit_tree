regulator: DA9052/53 Regulator support

The Dialog PMIC has below featured regulators:-
DA9052-BC - 4 DVS Buck converters 0.5V - 3.6V upto 1Amp.
DA9053-AA/BX - 4 DVS Buck converters 0.5V - 2.5V upto 3Amp.
DA9052/53 - 10 Programmable LDO's High PSSR, 1% accuracy.

This patch support all the DA9052 and Da9053 regulators. The output voltages are
fully programmable via I2C or SPI interface. The platform data with regulation
constraints is passed down from the board to the regulator.
