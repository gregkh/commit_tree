freezer: implement and use kthread_freezable_should_stop()

Writeback and thinkpad_acpi have been using thaw_process() to prevent
deadlock between the freezer and kthread_stop(); unfortunately, this
is inherently racy - nothing prevents freezing from happening between
thaw_process() and kthread_stop().

This patch implements kthread_freezable_should_stop() which enters
refrigerator if necessary but is guaranteed to return if
kthread_stop() is invoked.  Both thaw_process() users are converted to
use the new function.

Note that this deadlock condition exists for many of freezable
kthreads.  They need to be converted to use the new should_stop or
freezable workqueue.

Tested with synthetic test case.
