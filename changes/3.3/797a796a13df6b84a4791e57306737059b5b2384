asm-generic: architecture independent readq/writeq for 32bit environment

This provides unified readq()/writeq() helper functions for 32-bit
drivers.

For some cases, readq/writeq without atomicity is harmful, and order of
io access has to be specified explicitly.  So in this patch, new two
header files which contain non-atomic readq/writeq are added.

 - <asm-generic/io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h> provides non-atomic readq/
   writeq with the order of lower address -> higher address

 - <asm-generic/io-64-nonatomic-hi-lo.h> provides non-atomic readq/
   writeq with reversed order

This allows us to remove some readq()s that were added drivers when the
default non-atomic ones were removed in commit dbee8a0affd5 ("x86:
remove 32-bit versions of readq()/writeq()")

The drivers which need readq/writeq but can do with the non-atomic ones
must add the line:

  #include <asm-generic/io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h> /* or hi-lo.h */

But this will be nop in 64-bit environments, and no other #ifdefs are
required.  So I believe that this patch can solve the problem of
 1. driver-specific readq/writeq
 2. atomicity and order of io access

This patch is tested with building allyesconfig and allmodconfig as
ARCH=x86 and ARCH=i386 on top of tip/master.
