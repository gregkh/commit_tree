[S390] memory hotplug: prevent memory zone interleave

This fixes a kernel oops with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM triggered by a
VM_BUG_ON(bad_range()): kernel BUG at mm/page_alloc.c:748.

With memory hotplug on System z, it is possible that the memory
online/offline state is preserved over a system restart, e.g. there
may be offline memory blocks in ZONE_DMA or ZONE_NORMAL. So far,
the offline memory range has always been added to ZONE_MOVABLE during
system start, so that it was possible to have ZONE_MOVABLE interleave
with ZONE_DMA or ZONE_NORMAL. This patch fixes that by checking for
zone overlap before adding memory.
