zcache: Set SWIZ_BITS to 8 to reduce tmem bucket lock contention.

SWIZ_BITS > 8 results in a much larger number of "tmem_obj"
allocations, likely one per page-placed-in-frontswap.  The
tmem_obj is not huge (roughly 100 bytes), but it is large
enough to add a not-insignificant memory overhead to zcache.

The SWIZ_BITS=8  will get roughly the same lock contention
without the space wastage.

The effect of SWIZ_BITS can be thought of as "2^SWIZ_BITS is
the number of unique oids that be generated" (This concept is
limited to frontswap's use of tmem).
