xen/granttable: Support sub-page grants

- They can't be used to map the page (so can only be used in a GNTTABOP_copy
  hypercall).
- It's possible to grant access with a finer granularity than whole pages.
- Xen guarantees that they can be revoked quickly (a normal map grant can
  only be revoked with the cooperation of the domain which has been granted
  access).
