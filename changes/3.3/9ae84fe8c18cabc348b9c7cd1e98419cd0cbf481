mtd: fsl_elbc_nand: set Nand flash page address to FBAR and FPAR correctly

If we use the Nand flash chip whose number of pages in a block is greater
than 64(for large page), we must treat the low bit of FBAR as being the
high bit of the page address due to the limitation of FCM, it simply uses
the low 6-bits (for large page) of the combined block/page address as the
FPAR component, rather than considering the actual block size.
