tty/serial/pmac_zilog: Fix suspend & resume

This patch reworks & simplifies pmac_zilog handling of suspend/resume,
essentially removing all the specific code in there and using the
generic uart helpers.

This required properly registering the tty as a child of the macio (or platform)
device, so I had to delay the registration a bit (we used to register the ports
very very early). We still register the kernel console early though.

I removed a couple of unused or useless flags as well, relying on the
core to not call us when asleep. I also removed the essentially useless
interrupt mutex, simplifying the locking a bit.

I removed some code for handling unexpected interrupt which should never
be hit and could potentially be harmful (causing us to access a register
on a powered off SCC). We diable port interrupts on close always so there
should be no need to drain data on a closed port.
