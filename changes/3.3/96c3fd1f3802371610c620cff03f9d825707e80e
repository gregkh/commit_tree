md/raid10:  change read_balance to return an rdev

It makes more sense to return an rdev than just an index as
read_balance() gets a reference to the rdev and so returning
the pointer make this more idiomatic.

This will be needed in a future patch when we might return
a 'replacement' rdev instead of the main rdev.
