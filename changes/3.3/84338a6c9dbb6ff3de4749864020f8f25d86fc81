neighbour: Fixed race condition at tbl->nht

When the fixed race condition happens:

1. While function neigh_periodic_work scans the neighbor hash table
pointed by field tbl->nht, it unlocks and locks tbl->lock between
buckets in order to call cond_resched.

2. Assume that function neigh_periodic_work calls cond_resched, that is,
the lock tbl->lock is available, and function neigh_hash_grow runs.

3. Once function neigh_hash_grow finishes, and RCU calls
neigh_hash_free_rcu, the original struct neigh_hash_table that function
neigh_periodic_work was using doesn't exist anymore.

4. Once back at neigh_periodic_work, whenever the old struct
neigh_hash_table is accessed, things can go badly.
