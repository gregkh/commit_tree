Btrfs: add sequence numbers to delayed refs

Sequence numbers are needed to reconstruct the backrefs of a given extent to
a certain point in time. The total set of backrefs consist of the set of
backrefs recorded on disk plus the enqueued delayed refs for it that existed
at that moment.

This patch also adds a list that records all delayed refs which are
currently in the process of being added.

When walking all refs of an extent in btrfs_find_all_roots(), we freeze the
current state of delayed refs, honor anythinh up to this point and prevent
processing newer delayed refs to assert consistency.
