intel_idle: remove redundant local_irq_disable() call

irq disabling happens earlier in process_32.c:cpu_idle.  Basically,
cpuidle_state->enter is called, cpu irq is disabled.  cpuidle_state->enter
would turn on irq when exiting.

intel_idle doesn't follow this assumption.  Although it doesn't cause real
issue, it misleads developers.  Remove the call to local_irq_disable() at
entry.
