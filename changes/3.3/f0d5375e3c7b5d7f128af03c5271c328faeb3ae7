ARM: 7289/1: vmlinux.lds.S: do not hardcode cacheline size as 32 bytes

The linker script assumes a cacheline size of 32 bytes when aligning
the .data..cacheline_aligned and .data..percpu sections.

This patch updates the script to use L1_CACHE_BYTES, which should be set
to 64 on platforms that require it.
