MIPS: Netlogic: Move code common with XLP to common/

- Move code that can be shared with XLP (irq.c, smp.c, time.c and
  xlr_console.c) to arch/mips/netlogic/common
- Add asm/netlogic/haldefs.h and asm/netlogic/common.h for common and
  io functions shared with XLP
- remove type 'nlm_reg_t *' and use uint64_t for mmio offsets
- Move XLR specific code in smp.c to xlr/wakeup.c
- Move XLR specific PCI code from irq.c to mips/pci/pci-xlr.c
- Provide API for pic functions called from common/irq.c
