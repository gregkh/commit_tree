Btrfs: save balance parameters to disk

Introduce a new btree objectid for storing balance item.  The reason is
to be able to resume restriper after a crash with the same parameters.
Balance item has a very high objectid and goes into tree of tree roots.

The key for the new item is as follows:

	[ BTRFS_BALANCE_OBJECTID ; BTRFS_BALANCE_ITEM_KEY ; 0 ]

Older kernels simply ignore it so it's safe to mount with an older
kernel and then go back to the newer one.
