Fix race in process_vm_rw_core

This fixes the race in process_vm_core found by Oleg (see

  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1235667/

for details).

This has been updated since I last sent it as the creation of the new
mm_access() function did almost exactly the same thing as parts of the
previous version of this patch did.

In order to use mm_access() even when /proc isn't enabled, we move it to
kernel/fork.c where other related process mm access functions already
are.
