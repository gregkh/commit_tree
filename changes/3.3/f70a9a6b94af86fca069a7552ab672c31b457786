Btrfs: fix btrfsck error 400 when truncating a compressed

Reproduce steps:
 # mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb5
 # mount /dev/sdb5 -o compress=lzo /mnt
 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/tmpfile bs=128K count=1
 # sync
 # truncate -s 64K /mnt/tmpfile
 root 5 inode 257 errors 400

This is because of the wrong if condition, which is used to check if we should
subtract the bytes of the dropped range from i_blocks/i_bytes of i-node or not.
When we truncate a compressed extent, btrfs substracts the bytes of the whole
extent, it's wrong. We should substract the real size that we truncate, no
matter it is a compressed extent or not. Fix it.
