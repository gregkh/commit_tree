socket: initial cgroup code.

The goal of this work is to move the memory pressure tcp
controls to a cgroup, instead of just relying on global
conditions.

To avoid excessive overhead in the network fast paths,
the code that accounts allocated memory to a cgroup is
hidden inside a static_branch(). This branch is patched out
until the first non-root cgroup is created. So when nobody
is using cgroups, even if it is mounted, no significant performance
penalty should be seen.

This patch handles the generic part of the code, and has nothing
tcp-specific.
