thp: add tlb_remove_pmd_tlb_entry

We have tlb_remove_tlb_entry to indicate a pte tlb flush entry should be
flushed, but not a corresponding API for pmd entry.  This isn't a
problem so far because THP is only for x86 currently and tlb_flush()
under x86 will flush entire TLB.  But this is confusion and could be
missed if thp is ported to other arch.

Also convert tlb->need_flush = 1 to a VM_BUG_ON(!tlb->need_flush) in
__tlb_remove_page() as suggested by Andrea Arcangeli.  The
__tlb_remove_page() function is supposed to be called after
tlb_remove_xxx_tlb_entry() and we can catch any misuse.
