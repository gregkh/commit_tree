Bluetooth: btusb: hide more usb_submit_urb errors

There are still three calls of usb_submit_urb() that will print errors
if those calls return -EPERM or -ENODEV. I have never triggered these,
so I'm not sure when these return values might be seen. It still makes
sense to be silent if these occur (since "urb is being killed" and
"device got disconnected" aren't things to worry about).
