[media] hdpvr: update picture controls to support firmware versions > 0.15

Correctly sets the max/min/default values for the hdpvr picture
controls. The reason the current values didn't cause a problem until now
is because any firmware <= 0.15 didn't support them. The latest firmware
releases properly support picture controls and the values in the patch
are derived from the windows driver using SniffUSB2.0.
