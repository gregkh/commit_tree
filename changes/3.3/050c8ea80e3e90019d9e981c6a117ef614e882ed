block: separate out blk_rq_merge_ok() and blk_try_merge() from elevator functions

blk_rq_merge_ok() is the elevator-neutral part of merge eligibility
test.  blk_try_merge() determines merge direction and expects the
caller to have tested elv_rq_merge_ok() previously.

elv_rq_merge_ok() now wraps blk_rq_merge_ok() and then calls
elv_iosched_allow_merge().  elv_try_merge() is removed and the two
callers are updated to call elv_rq_merge_ok() explicitly followed by
blk_try_merge().  While at it, make rq_merge_ok() functions return
bool.

This is to prepare for plug merge update and doesn't introduce any
behavior change.

This is based on Jens' patch to skip elevator_allow_merge_fn() from
plug merge.
