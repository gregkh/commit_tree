mm: bootmem: drop superfluous range check when freeing pages in bulk

The area node_bootmem_map represents is aligned to BITS_PER_LONG, and all
bits in any aligned word of that map valid.  When the represented area
extends beyond the end of the node, the non-existant pages will be marked
as reserved.

As a result, when freeing a page block, doing an explicit range check for
whether that block is within the node's range is redundant as the bitmap
is consulted anyway to see whether all pages in the block are unreserved.
