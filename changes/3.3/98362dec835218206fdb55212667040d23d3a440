KVM: Fix whitespace in kvm_para.h

When syncing KVM headers with QEMU I (or whoever applies the
diff) end up automatically fixing whitespaces. One of them
is in kvm_para.h.

It's a lot more consistent for people who don't do the whitespace
fixups automatically to already have fixed headers in Linux. So
remove the sparse empty line at the end of kvm_para.h and everyone's
happy.
