tcp: fix tcp_trim_head()

commit f07d960df3 (tcp: avoid frag allocation for small frames)
breaked assumption in tcp stack that skb is either linear (skb->data_len
== 0), or fully fragged (skb->data_len == skb->len)

tcp_trim_head() made this assumption, we must fix it.

Thanks to Vijay for providing a very detailed explanation.
