usb: Skip PCI USB quirk handling for Netlogic XLP

The Netlogic XLP SoC's on-chip USB controller appears as a PCI
USB device, but does not need the EHCI/OHCI handoff done in
usb/host/pci-quirks.c.

The pci-quirks.c is enabled for all vendors and devices, and is
enabled if USB and PCI are configured.

If we do not skip the qurik handling on XLP, the readb() call in
ehci_bios_handoff() will cause a crash since byte access is not
supported for EHCI registers in XLP.
