[SCSI] qla4xxx: Limit the ACB Default Timeout value to 12s

A wrong default timeout value programmed in the adapter causes driver
to wait for that much time while waiting for target discoveries to complete.
This could add huge delays during the driver load time. To avoid this,
limit the default timeout value to 12 seconds if the default timeout value
set in adapter is less than 12 seconds and greater than 120 seconds.
