md: two small fixes to handling interrupt resync.

1/ If a resync is aborted we should record how far we got
 (recovery_cp) the last request that we know has completed
 (->curr_resync_completed) rather than the last request that was
 submitted (->curr_resync).

2/ When a resync aborts we still want to update the metadata with
 any changes, so set MD_CHANGE_DEVS even if we 'skip'.
