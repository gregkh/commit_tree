vfs: fix the stupidity with i_dentry in inode destructors

Seeing that just about every destructor got that INIT_LIST_HEAD() copied into
it, there is no point whatsoever keeping this INIT_LIST_HEAD in inode_init_once();
the cost of taking it into inode_init_always() will be negligible for pipes
and sockets and negative for everything else.  Not to mention the removal of
boilerplate code from ->destroy_inode() instances...
