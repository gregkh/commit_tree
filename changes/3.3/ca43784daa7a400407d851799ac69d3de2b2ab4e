ARM: bcmring: fix build failure in mach-bcmring/arch.c

Upstream commit d1fce9c115eeb93e01c01732dfe9a86cf76009cf

   "ARM: restart: bcmring: use new restart hook"

breaks building of this platform, since what used to be the
last field of the MACHINE_START/END block didn't have a
trailing comma.  Once another field was added below, we get:

arch/arm/mach-bcmring/arch.c:198: error: request for member 'restart' in something not a structure or union
