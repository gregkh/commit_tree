eCryptfs: Sanitize write counts of /dev/ecryptfs

A malicious count value specified when writing to /dev/ecryptfs may
result in a a very large kernel memory allocation.

This patch peeks at the specified packet payload size, adds that to the
size of the packet headers and compares the result with the write count
value. The resulting maximum memory allocation size is approximately 532
bytes.
