autofs4: autofs4_wait() vs. autofs4_catatonic_mode() race

We need to recheck ->catatonic after autofs4_wait() got ->wq_mutex
for good, or we might end up with wq inserted into queue after
autofs4_catatonic_mode() had done its thing.  It will stick there
forever, since there won't be anything to clear its ->name.name.

A bit of a complication: validate_request() drops and regains ->wq_mutex.
It actually ends up the most convenient place to stick the check into...
