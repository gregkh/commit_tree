Revert "drm/i810: cleanup reclaim_buffers"

This reverts commit 87499ffdcb1c70f66988cd8febc4ead0ba2f9118.

Where is that paper bag ... ah here.

I've failed to take an odd interaction between my other cleanups and
this reclaim_buffers patch into account and also failed to properly
test it. Looks like there are more dragons and hidden trapdoors in the
drm release path than actual lines of code.

Until I get a clue, let's just revert this.
