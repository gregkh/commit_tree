[S390] cleanup trap handling

Move the program interruption code and the translation exception identifier
to the pt_regs structure as 'int_code' and 'int_parm_long' and make the
first level interrupt handler in entry[64].S store the two values. That
makes it possible to drop 'prot_addr' and 'trap_no' from the thread_struct
and to reduce the number of arguments to a lot of functions. Finally
un-inline do_trap. Overall this saves 5812 bytes in the .text section of
the 64 bit kernel.
