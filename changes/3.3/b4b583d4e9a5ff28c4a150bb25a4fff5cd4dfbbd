HID: be more strict when ignoring out-of-range fields

HID 1.11 specification, section 5.10 tells us:

	HID class devices support the ability to ignore selected fields in a
	report at run- time. This is accomplished by declaring bit field in a
	report that is capable of containing a range of values larger than
	those actually generated by the control. If the host or the device
	receives an out-of-range value then the current value for the
	respective control will not be modified.

So we shouldn't be restricted to EV_ABS only.
