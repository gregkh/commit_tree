btrfs: fix dirtied pages accounting on sub-page writes

When doing 1KB sequential writes to the same page,
balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr() should be called once instead of 4
times, the latter makes the dirtier tasks be throttled much too heavy.

Fix it with proper de-accounting on clear_page_dirty_for_io().
