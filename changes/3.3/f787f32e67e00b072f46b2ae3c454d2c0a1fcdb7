module_param: make bool parameters really bool (drivers/video/i810)

module_param(bool) used to counter-intuitively take an int.  In
fddd5201 (mid-2009) we allowed bool or int/unsigned int using a messy
trick.

It's time to remove the int/unsigned int option.  For this version
it'll simply give a warning, but it'll break next kernel version.
