sched: Fix lockup by limiting load-balance retries on lock-break

Eric and David reported dead machines and traced it to commit
a195f004 ("sched: Fix load-balance lock-breaking"), it turns out
there's still a scenario where we can end up re-trying forever.

Since there is no strict forward progress guarantee in the
load-balance iteration we can get stuck re-retrying the same
task-set over and over.

Creating a forward progress guarantee with the existing
structure is somewhat non-trivial, for now simply terminate the
retry loop after a few tries.
