mm: memcg: lookup_page_cgroup (almost) never returns NULL

Pages have their corresponding page_cgroup descriptors set up before
they are used in userspace, and thus managed by a memory cgroup.

The only time where lookup_page_cgroup() can return NULL is in the
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM-only page sanity checking code that executes while
feeding pages into the page allocator for the first time.

Remove the NULL checks against lookup_page_cgroup() results from all
callsites where we know that corresponding page_cgroup descriptors must
be allocated, and add a comment to the callsite that actually does have
to check the return value.
