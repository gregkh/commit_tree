xfs: change available ranges of softlimit and hardlimit in quota check

In general, quota allows us to use disk blocks and inodes up to each
limit, that is, they are available if they don't exceed their limitations.
Current xfs sets their available ranges to lower than them except disk
inode quota check. So, this patch changes the ranges to not beyond them.
