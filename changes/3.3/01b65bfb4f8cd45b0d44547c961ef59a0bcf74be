ALSA: hda - Supports more audio streams

So far, the driver supports up to 10 streams.  This is a restriction in
hda_intel.c and hda_codec.c: in the former, the fixed array size limits
the amount, and in the latter, the fixed device-number assignment table
(in get_empty_pcm_device()) limits the possibility.

This patch reduces the restriction by
- using linked list for managing PCM instances in hda_intel.c, and
- assigning non-fixed device numbers for the extra devices
