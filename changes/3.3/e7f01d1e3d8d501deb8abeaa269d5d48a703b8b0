perf tools: Use scnprintf where applicable

Several places were expecting that the value returned was the number of
characters printed, not what would be printed if there was space.

Fix it by using the scnprintf and vscnprintf variants we inherited from
the kernel sources.

Some corner cases where the number of printed characters were not
accounted were fixed too.
