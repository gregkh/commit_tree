[SCSI] mpt2sas: Better handling DEAD IOC (PCI-E LInk down) error condition

Detection of Dead IOC has been done in fault_reset_work thread.

If IOC Doorbell is 0xFFFFFFFF, it will be detected as non-operation/DEAD IOC.
When a DEAD IOC is detected, the code is modified to remove that IOC and
all its attached devices from OS.
The PCI layer API pci_remove_bus_device() is called to remove the dead IOC.
