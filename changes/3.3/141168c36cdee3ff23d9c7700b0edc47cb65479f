x86: Simplify code by removing a !SMP #ifdefs from 'struct cpuinfo_x86'

Several fields in struct cpuinfo_x86 were not defined for the
!SMP case, likely to save space.  However, those fields still
have some meaning for UP, and keeping them allows some #ifdef
removal from other files.  The additional size of the UP kernel
from this change is not significant enough to worry about
keeping up the distinction:

	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	4737168	 506459	 972040	6215667	 5ed7f3	vmlinux.o.before
	4737444	 506459	 972040	6215943	 5ed907	vmlinux.o.after

for a difference of 276 bytes for an example UP config.

If someone wants those 276 bytes back badly then it should
be implemented in a cleaner way.
