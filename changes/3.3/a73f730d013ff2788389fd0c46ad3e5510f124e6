block, cfq: move cfqd->cic_index to q->id

cfq allocates per-queue id using ida and uses it to index cic radix
tree from io_context.  Move it to q->id and allocate on queue init and
free on queue release.  This simplifies cfq a bit and will allow for
further improvements of io context life-cycle management.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional difference.
