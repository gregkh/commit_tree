zcache: fix deadlock condition

I discovered this deadlock condition awhile ago working on RAMster
but it affects zcache as well.  The list spinlock must be
locked prior to the page spinlock and released after.  As
a result, the page copy must also be done while the locks are held.

Applies to 3.2.  Konrad, please push (via GregKH?)...
this is definitely a bug fix so need not be pushed during
a -rc0 window.
