ARM: OMAP: hwmod: add support for selecting mpu_irq for each wakeup pad

By default all registered pads will trigger mpu_irqs[0]. Now there is
an API for selecting used mpu_irq on pad basis, which can be used to
trigger different irq handlers for different pads in the same hwmod.
Each pad that requires its interrupt to be re-routed this way must
have a separate call to omap_hwmod_pad_route_irq(hwmod, pad, irq).
