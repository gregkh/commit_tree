drm: add support for private planes

In cases where the scanout hw is sufficiently similar between "overlay"
and traditional crtc layers, it might be convenient to allow the driver
to create internal drm_plane helper objects used by the drm_crtc
implementation, rather than duplicate code between the plane and crtc.
A private plane is not exposed to userspace.
