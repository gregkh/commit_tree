PM / Sleep: Make [un]lock_system_sleep() generic

The [un]lock_system_sleep() APIs were originally introduced to mutually
exclude memory hotplug and hibernation.

Directly using mutex_lock(&pm_mutex) to achieve mutual exclusion with
suspend or hibernation code can lead to freezing failures. However, the
APIs [un]lock_system_sleep() can be safely used to achieve the same,
without causing freezing failures.

So, since it would be beneficial to modify all the existing users of
mutex_lock(&pm_mutex) (in all parts of the kernel), so that they use these
safe APIs intead, make these APIs generic by removing the restriction that
they work only when CONFIG_HIBERNATE_CALLBACKS is set. Moreover, that
restriction didn't buy us anything anyway.
