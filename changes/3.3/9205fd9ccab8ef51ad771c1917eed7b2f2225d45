tg3: switch to build_skb() infrastructure

This is very similar to bnx2x conversion, but simpler since no special
alignement is required, so goal was not to reduce skb truesize.

Using build_skb() reduces cache line misses in the driver, since we
use cache hot skb instead of cold ones. Number of in-flight sk_buff
structures is lower, they are more likely recycled in SLUB caches
while still hot.
