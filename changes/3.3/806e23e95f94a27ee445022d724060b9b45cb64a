[media] uvcvideo: Fix integer overflow in uvc_ioctl_ctrl_map()

There is a potential integer overflow in uvc_ioctl_ctrl_map(). When a
large xmap->menu_count is passed from the userspace, the subsequent call
to kmalloc() will allocate a buffer smaller than expected.
map->menu_count and map->menu_info would later be used in a loop (e.g.
in uvc_query_v4l2_ctrl), which leads to out-of-bound access.

The patch checks the ioctl argument and returns -EINVAL for zero or too
large values in xmap->menu_count.
