Bluetooth: EWS: extended window size option support

Adds support for extended window size (EWS) config option. We enable EWS
feature in L2CAP Info RSP when hs enabled. EWS option is included in L2CAP
Config Req if tx_win (which is set via socket) bigger then standard default
value (63) && hs enabled && remote side supports EWS feature.

Using EWS selects extended control field in L2CAP.

Code partly based on Qualcomm and Atheros patches sent upstream a year ago.
