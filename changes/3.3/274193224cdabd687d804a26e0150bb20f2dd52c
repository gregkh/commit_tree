block: recursive merge requests

In my workload, thread 1 accesses a, a+2, ..., thread 2 accesses a+1,
a+3,.... When the requests are flushed to queue, a and a+1 are merged
to (a, a+1), a+2 and a+3 too to (a+2, a+3), but (a, a+1) and (a+2, a+3)
aren't merged.
With recursive merge below, the workload throughput gets improved 20%
and context switch drops 60%.
