cgroup: fix to allow mounting a hierarchy by name

If we mount a hierarchy with a specified name, the name is unique,
and we can use it to mount the hierarchy without specifying its
set of subsystem names. This feature is documented is
Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt section 2.3

Here's an example:

	# mount -t cgroup -o cpuset,name=myhier xxx /cgroup1
	# mount -t cgroup -o name=myhier xxx /cgroup2

But it was broken by commit 32a8cf235e2f192eb002755076994525cdbaa35a
(cgroup: make the mount options parsing more accurate)

This fixes the regression.
