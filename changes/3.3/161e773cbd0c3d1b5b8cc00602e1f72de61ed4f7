UART: add CSR SiRFprimaII SoC on-chip uart drivers

SiRFprimaII is the latest generation application processor from CSRâ€™s
multi-function SoC product family.
The SoC support codes are in arch/arm/mach-prima2 from Linux mainline
3.0.

There are three dedicated UARTs in system. This patch adds basic driver
support for them.

It has used the newest pinmux subsystem from Linus Walleij.
