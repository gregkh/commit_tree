memblock: Remove memblock_memory_can_coalesce()

Arch could implement memblock_memor_can_coalesce() to veto merging of
adjacent or overlapping memblock regions; however, no arch did and any
vetoing would trigger WARN_ON().  Memblock regions are supposed to
deal with proper memory anyway.  Remove the unused hook.
