mlx4: fix QP tree trashing

When adding new unicast steer entry, before moving qp to state ready,
actually before calling mlx4_RST2INIT_QP_wrapper(), there were added
a lot of entries with local_qpn=0 into radix tree.
This fact impacted the get_res() function and proper functioning
of resource tracker in addition to adding trash entries into radix tree.
