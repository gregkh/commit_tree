tomoyo: stop including hell knows what

tomoyo/realpath.c needs exactly one include - that of common.h.  It pulls
everything the thing needs, without doing ridiculous garbage such as trying
to include ../../fs/internal.h.  If that alone doesn't scream "layering
violation", I don't know what does; and these days it's all for nothing,
since it fortunately does not use any symbols defined in there...
