ARM: 7348/1: arm/spear600: fix one-shot timer

Currently, the "clockevent_next_event" function only works correctly
if the timer is not running when this function is called, which is
not always the case when running with CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS.

Fix this by stopping the timer at the beginning of this function.
