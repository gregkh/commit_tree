kbuild: Fix compiler warning with assertion when calling 'fwrite'

Reinhard Tartler discovered a corner case of calling xfwrite() where the
length of the string is zero.

Arnaud Lacombe suggested to use assertion for the corner case, as
fwrite(3) is currently used:

 1) in comment printers. Empty comment are not allowed.
 2) in a callback passed to expr_print(), where the string printed is
    either NULL OR non-empty.
 3) in the lexer, auto-generated, and unused.

I feel using assertion is a good solution:

 1) It cleanly takes care of the above-mentioned corner case.
 2) It can be easily disabled by defining NDEBUG.
 3) It asserts xfwrite() is simply a wrapper for fwrite().
