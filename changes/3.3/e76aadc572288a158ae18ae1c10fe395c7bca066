mac80211: revert on-channel work optimisations

The on-channel work optimisations have caused a
number of issues, and the code is unfortunately
very complex and almost impossible to follow.
Instead of attempting to put in more workarounds
let's just remove those optimisations, we can
work on them again later, after we change the
whole auth/assoc design.

This should fix rate_control_send_low() warnings,
see RH bug 731365.
