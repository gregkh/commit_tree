SPI: Add helper macro for spi_driver boilerplate

This patch introduces the module_spi_driver macro which is a convenience macro
for SPI driver modules similar to module_platform_driver. It is intended to be
used by drivers which init/exit section does nothing but register/unregister
the SPI driver. By using this macro it is possible to eliminate a few lines of
boilerplate code per SPI driver.
