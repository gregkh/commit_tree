ALSA: hdspm - Provide unique driver id based on card serial

Before, /proc/asound looked like this:

 2 [Default        ]: HDSPM - RME RayDAT_f1cd85
                      RME RayDAT S/N 0xf1cd85 at 0xf7300000, irq 18

In case of a second HDSPM card, its name would be Default_1. This is
cumbersome, because the order of the cards isn't stable across reboots.

To help userspace tools referring to the correct card, this commit
provides a unique id for each card:

 2 [HDSPMxf1cd85   ]: HDSPM - RME RayDAT_f1cd85
                      RME RayDAT S/N 0xf1cd85 at 0xf7300000, irq 18

In this example, userspace (configuration files) would then use
hw:HDSPMxf1cd85 to choose the right card.

The serial is masked to 24bits, so this string is always shorter than
sixteen chars.
