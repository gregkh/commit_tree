Add optional region->nid which can be enabled by arch using
CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP.  When enabled, memblock also carries
NUMA node information and replaces early_node_map[].

Newly added memblocks have MAX_NUMNODES as nid.  Arch can then call
memblock_set_node() to set node information.  memblock takes care of
merging and node affine allocations w.r.t. node information.

When MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP is enabled, early_node_map[], related data
structures and functions to manipulate and iterate it are disabled.
memblock version of __next_mem_pfn_range() is provided such that
for_each_mem_pfn_range() behaves the same and its users don't have to
be updated.

-v2: Yinghai spotted section mismatch caused by missing
     __init_memblock in memblock_set_node().  Fixed.
