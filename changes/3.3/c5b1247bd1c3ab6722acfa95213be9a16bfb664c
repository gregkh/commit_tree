staging: drm/omap: fix locking issue

The create/free mmap offset code must be synchronized.  Yet only some
callers of omap_gem_mmap_offset() held struct_mutex.  Leading to various
crashes around drm_mm_insert_helper_range().  (In the free-object path,
which is currently the only place we drm_gem_free_mmap_offset(),
struct_mutex is already held.)
