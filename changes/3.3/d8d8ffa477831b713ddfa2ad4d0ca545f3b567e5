amba-pl011: do not disable RTS during shutdown

In present driver, shutdown clears RTS and DTR in CR register. But the
documentation "Documentation/serial/driver" suggests not to disable
RTS and DTR in shutdown(). Also RTS and DTR is preserved between shutdown
and startup calls, i.e. these are restored in startup if they were enabled
while doing shutdown. So that if RTS and DTR are set using pl011_set_mctrl
then it should continue even after shutdown->startup sequence.
For throttling/unthrottling user should call pl011_set_mctrl.
