Bluetooth: Remove usage of __cancel_delayed_work()

__cancel_delayed_work() is being used in some paths where we cannot
sleep waiting for the delayed work to finish. However, that function
might return while the timer is running and the work will be queued
again. Replace the calls with safer cancel_delayed_work() version
which spins until the timer handler finishes on other CPUs and
cancels the delayed work.
