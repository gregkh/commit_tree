block: misc updates to blk_get_queue()

* blk_get_queue() is peculiar in that it returns 0 on success and 1 on
  failure instead of 0 / -errno or boolean.  Update it such that it
  returns %true on success and %false on failure.

* Make sure the caller checks for the return value.

* Separate out __blk_get_queue() which doesn't check whether @q is
  dead and put it in blk.h.  This will be used later.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
