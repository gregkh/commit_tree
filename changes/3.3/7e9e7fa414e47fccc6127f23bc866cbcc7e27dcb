brcmsmac: remove PCI suspend/resume from bcma driver

The brcmsmac driver isn't a PCI driver any more, it's a bcma one.  The
PCI device has been resumed by the PCI driver (the generic PCI layer,
really), we should be resuming just our own driver state.

Also add pr_debug() calls to show that we now actually get the
suspend/resume events.
