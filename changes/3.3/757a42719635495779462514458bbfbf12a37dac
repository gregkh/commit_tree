dlm: add node slots and generation

Slot numbers are assigned to nodes when they join the lockspace.
The slot number chosen is the minimum unused value starting at 1.
Once a node is assigned a slot, that slot number will not change
while the node remains a lockspace member.  If the node leaves
and rejoins it can be assigned a new slot number.

A new generation number is also added to a lockspace.  It is
set and incremented during each recovery along with the slot
collection/assignment.

The slot numbers will be passed to gfs2 which will use them as
journal id's.
