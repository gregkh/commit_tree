evm: digital signature verification support

This patch adds support for digital signature verification to EVM.
With this feature file metadata can be protected using digital
signature instead of an HMAC. When building an image,
which has to be flashed to different devices, an HMAC cannot
be used to sign file metadata, because the HMAC key should be
different on every device.
