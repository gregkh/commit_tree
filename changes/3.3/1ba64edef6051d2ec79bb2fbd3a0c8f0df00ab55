block, sx8: kill blk_insert_request()

The only user left for blk_insert_request() is sx8 and it can be
trivially switched to use blk_execute_rq_nowait() - special requests
aren't included in io stat and sx8 doesn't use block layer tagging.
Switch sx8 and kill blk_insert_requeset().

This patch doesn't introduce any functional difference.

Only compile tested.
