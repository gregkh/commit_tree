jbd: clear revoked flag on buffers before a new transaction started

Currently, we clear revoked flag only when a block is reused.  However,
this can tigger a false journal error.  Consider a situation when a block
is used as a meta block and is deleted(revoked) in ordered mode, then the
block is allocated as a data block to a file.  At this moment, user changes
the file's journal mode from ordered to journaled and truncates the file.
The block will be considered re-revoked by journal because it has revoked
flag still pending from the last transaction and an assertion triggers.

We fix the problem by keeping the revoked status more uptodate - we clear
revoked flag when switching revoke tables to reflect there is no revoked
buffers in current transaction any more.
