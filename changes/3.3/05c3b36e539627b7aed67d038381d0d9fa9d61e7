ALSA: HDA: Fix jack creation for codecs with front and rear Line In

If a codec has both a front and a rear Line In, two controls both
named "Line Jack" will be created, which causes parsing to fail.
While a long term solution might be to name the jacks differently,
this extra check is consistent with what is already being done in many
auto-parsers, and will also protect against other cases when two
inputs have the same label.
