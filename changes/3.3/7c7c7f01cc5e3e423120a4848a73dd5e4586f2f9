vhost-net: add module alias (v2.1)

By adding some module aliases, programs (or users) won't have to explicitly
call modprobe. Vhost-net will always be available if built into the kernel.
It does require assigning a permanent minor number for depmod to work.

Also:
  - use C99 style initialization.
  - add missing entry in documentation for loop-control
