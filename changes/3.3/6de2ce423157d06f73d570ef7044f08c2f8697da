CIFS: Fix mkdir/rmdir bug for the non-POSIX case

Currently we do inc/drop_nlink for a parent directory for every
mkdir/rmdir calls. That's wrong when Unix extensions are disabled
because in this case a server doesn't follow the same semantic and
returns the old value on the next QueryInfo request. As the result,
we update our value with the server one and then decrement it on
every rmdir call - go to negative nlink values.

Fix this by removing inc/drop_nlink for the parent directory from
mkdir/rmdir, setting it for a revalidation and ignoring NumberOfLinks
for directories when Unix extensions are disabled.
