Bluetooth: Incoming ACL packets do not force active mode

Incoming sk_buffs always have bt_cb(skb)->force_active set to 0, so
it's misleading to use that value from the control block when calling
hci_conn_enter_active_mode() for incoming data. The destination socket
is not known in the HCI layer, so the force_active setting for each
socket isn't known either. Hard-coding the force_active parameter does
not change any behavior, but makes it obvious that incoming ACL data
never exits sniff mode.
