ARM: orion: Fix USB phy for orion5x.

The patch "ARM: orion: Consolidate USB platform setup code.", commit
4fcd3f374a928081d391cd9a570afe3b2c692fdc broke USB on TS-7800 and
other orion5x boards, because the wrong type of PHY was being passed
to the EHCI driver in the platform data. Orion5x needs EHCI_PHY_ORION
and all the others want EHCI_PHY_NA.

Allow the mach- code to tell the generic plat-orion code which USB PHY
enum to place into the platform data.

Version 2: Rebase to v3.3-rc2.
