sh: sh2a: Improve cache flush/invalidate functions

The cache functions lock out interrupts for long periods; this patch
reduces the impact when operating on large address ranges. In such
cases it will:
- Invalidate the entire cache rather than individual addresses.
- Do nothing when flushing the operand cache in write-through mode.
- When flushing the operand cache in write-back mdoe, index the
  search for matching addresses on the cache entires instead of the
  addresses to flush

Note: sh2a__flush_purge_region was only invalidating the operand
cache, this adds flush.
