m68k: use addr_limit checking for m68k CPUs that do no support address spaces

The ColdFire CPU family, and the original 68000, do not support separate
address spaces like the other 680x0 CPU types. Modify the set_fs()/get_fs()
functions and macros to use a thread_info addr_limit for address space
checking. This is pretty much what all other architectures that do not
support separate setable address spaces do.
