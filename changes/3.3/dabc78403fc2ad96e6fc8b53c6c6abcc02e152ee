sbc834x: put full compat string in board match check

The commit 883c2cfc8bcc0fd00c5d9f596fb8870f481b5bda:

 "fix of_flat_dt_is_compatible() to match the full compatible string"

causes silent boot death on the sbc8349 board because it was
just looking for 8349 and not 8349E -- as originally there
were non-E (no SEC/encryption) chips available.  Just add the
E to the board detection string since all boards I've seen
were manufactured with the E versions.
