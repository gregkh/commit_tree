xfs: replace i_flock with a sleeping bitlock

We almost never block on i_flock, the exception is synchronous inode
flushing.  Instead of bloating the inode with a 16/24-byte completion
that we abuse as a semaphore just implement it as a bitlock that uses
a bit waitqueue for the rare sleeping path.  This primarily is a
tradeoff between a much smaller inode and a faster non-blocking
path vs faster wakeups, and we are much better off with the former.

A small downside is that we will lose lockdep checking for i_flock, but
given that it's always taken inside the ilock that should be acceptable.

Note that for example the inode writeback locking is implemented in a
very similar way.
