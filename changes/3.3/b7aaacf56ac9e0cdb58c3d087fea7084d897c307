After 270968c0984ae "bq27x00_battery: Fix reporting status value for
bq27500 battery" status doesn't seem to be reported correctly when the
battery is close to fully charged state. It reports "Not charging"
while in fact there is >130mA current flowing to the battery according
to current_now.

This status report seems to be based on CHG bit in status register,
but looking at the datasheet the description says "(Fast) charging
allowed", which I guess means that the chip recommends charging and
not that charging is actually going on? If you check the bit while
battery is discharging and it's not full, the bit is also set.
