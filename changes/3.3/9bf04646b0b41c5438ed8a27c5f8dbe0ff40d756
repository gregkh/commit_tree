netfilter: revert user-space expectation helper support

This patch partially reverts:
3d058d7 netfilter: rework user-space expectation helper support
that was applied during the 3.2 development cycle.

After this patch, the tree remains just like before patch bc01bef,
that initially added the preliminary infrastructure.

I decided to partially revert this patch because the approach
that I proposed to resolve this problem is broken in NAT setups.
Moreover, a new infrastructure will be submitted for the 3.3.x
development cycle that resolve the existing issues while
providing a neat solution.

Since nobody has been seriously using this infrastructure in
user-space, the removal of this feature should affect any know
FOSS project (to my knowledge).
