ACPI: Export interfaces for ioremapping/iounmapping ACPI registers

Export remapping and unmapping interfaces - acpi_os_map_generic_address()
and acpi_os_unmap_generic_address() - for ACPI generic registers that are
backed by memory mapped I/O (MMIO).

The acpi_os_map_generic_address() and acpi_os_unmap_generic_address()
declarations may more properly belong in include/acpi/acpiosxf.h next to
acpi_os_read_memory() but I believe that would require the ACPI CA making
them an official part of the ACPI CA - OS interface.

ACPI Generic Address Structure (GAS) reference (ACPI's fixed/generic
hardware registers use the GAS format):
  ACPI Specification, Revision 4.0, Section 5.2.3.1, "Generic Address
  Structure"
