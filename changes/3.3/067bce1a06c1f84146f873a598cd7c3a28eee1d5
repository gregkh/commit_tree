c/r: introduce CHECKPOINT_RESTORE symbol

For checkpoint/restore we need auxilary features being compiled into the
kernel, such as additional prctl codes, /proc/<pid>/map_files and etc...
but same time these features are not mandatory for a regular kernel so
CHECKPOINT_RESTORE config symbol should bring a way to disable them all at
once if one wish to get rid of additional functionality.
