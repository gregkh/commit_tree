net: Disambiguate kernel message

Some of our machines were reporting:

TCP: too many of orphaned sockets

even when the number of orphaned sockets was well below the
limit.

We print a different message depending on whether we're out
of TCP memory or there are too many orphaned sockets.

Also move the check out of line and cleanup the messages
that were printed.
