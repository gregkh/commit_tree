staging: android: lowmemorykiller: Don't try to kill the same pid over and over

  Under certain circumstances, a process can take awhile to
handle a sig-kill (especially if it's in a scheduler group with
a very low share ratio). When this occurs, lowmemkiller returns
to vmscan indicating the process memory has been freed - even
though the process is still waiting to die. Since the memory
hasn't actually freed, lowmemkiller is called again shortly after,
and picks the same process to die; regardless of the fact that
it has already been 'scheduled' to die and the memory has already
been reported to vmscan as having been freed.

  Solution is to check fatal_signal_pending() on the selected
task, and if it's already pending destruction return; indicating
to vmscan that no resources were freed on this pass.
