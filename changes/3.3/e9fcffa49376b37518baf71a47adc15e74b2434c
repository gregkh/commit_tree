m68k: adjustments to stack frame for ColdFire with MMU enabled

The exception return stack adjustment required by ColdFire when running
with the MMU enabled is not completely identical to 680x0 processors.
Specifically the format type 4 stack frame doesn't need any stack
adjustment on exception return. And the ColdFire always must return with
a frame type of 4, not 0.
