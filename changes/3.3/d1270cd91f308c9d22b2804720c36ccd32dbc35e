Btrfs: put back delayed refs that are too new

When processing a delayed ref, first check if there are still old refs in
the process of being added. If so, put this ref back to the tree. To avoid
looping on this ref, choose a newer one in the next loop.
btrfs_find_ref_cluster has to take care of that.
