rtlwifi: merge ips,lps spinlocks into one mutex

With previous patch "rtlwifi: use work for lps" we can now use mutex for
protecting ps mode changing critical sections. This fixes running system
with interrupts disabled for long time.

Merge ips_lock and lps_lock as they seems to protect the same data
structures (accessed in rtl_ps_set_rf_state() function).
