ACPI processor: Remove unneeded variable passed by acpi_processor_hotadd_init V2

V2: Fix typo: pr->handle -> pr, here: acpi_processor_hotadd_init(pr)

This is a very small part taken from patches which afaik
are coming from Yunhong Jiang (for a Xen not a Linus repo?).

Cleanup only: no functional change.

Advantage (beside cleanup) is that other data of the pr (acpi_processor) struct
in the acpi_processor_hotadd_init() is needed later, for example a newly
introduced flag:
pr->flags.need_hotplug_init
