ARM: S3C2440: move handling of fclk/n clock to platform code

s3c2440 uses fclk/n (fclk divided by n) clock as one of the possible clocks used
to generate the baud rate clock. The divider 'n' in this case can be logically
represented outside of the uart controller.

This patch creates a new clock by name "fclk_n" for s3c2440 based platforms to
represent the fclk/n clock in the platform code. This clock provides a get_rate
callback that checks the UCON0/1/2 registers to determine the clock rate. The
samsung uart driver would receive the "fclk_n" clock name as one of the possible
baud rate clock options and the driver need not determine clock rate of fclk/n.
