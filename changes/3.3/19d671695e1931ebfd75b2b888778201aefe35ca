md/raid1: Mark device want_replacement when we see a write error.

Now that WantReplacement drives are replaced cleanly, mark a drive
as want_replacement when we see a write error.  It might get failed soon so
the WantReplacement flag is irrelevant, but if the write error is recorded
in the bad block log, we still want to activate any spare that might
be available.
