ARM: 7314/1: kuser: consistently use usr_ret for returning from helpers

__kuser_cmpxchg64 has a return path using bx lr to get back to the caller.
This is actually ok since the code in question is predicated on
CONFIG_CPU_32v6K, but for the sake of consistency using the usr_ret
macro is probably better.
