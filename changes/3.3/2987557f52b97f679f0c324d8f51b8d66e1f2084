driver-core/cpu: Expose hotpluggability to the rest of the kernel

When architectures register CPUs, they indicate whether the CPU allows
hotplugging; notably, x86 and ARM don't allow hotplugging CPU 0.
Userspace can easily query the hotpluggability of a CPU via sysfs;
however, the kernel has no convenient way of accessing that property in
an architecture-independent way.  While the kernel can simply try it and
see, some code needs to distinguish between "hotplug failed" and
"hotplug has no hope of working on this CPU"; for example, rcutorture's
CPU hotplug tests want to avoid drowning out real hotplug failures with
expected failures.

Expose this property via a new cpu_is_hotpluggable function, so that the
rest of the kernel can access it in an architecture-independent way.
