net: Define enum for net device features.

Define feature values by bit position instead of direct 2**i values
and force the values to be of type netdev_features_t.

Cleaned and extended from patch by Mahesh Bandewar <maheshb@google.com>:
+ added netdev_features_t casts
+ included bits under NETIF_F_GSO_MASK
+ moved feature #defines out of struct net_device definition
