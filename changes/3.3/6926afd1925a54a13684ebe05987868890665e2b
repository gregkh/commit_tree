NFSv4: Save the owner/group name string when doing open

...so that we can do the uid/gid mapping outside the asynchronous RPC
context.
This fixes a bug in the current NFSv4 atomic open code where the client
isn't able to determine what the true uid/gid fields of the file are,
(because the asynchronous nature of the OPEN call denies it the ability
to do an upcall) and so fills them with default values, marking the
inode as needing revalidation.
Unfortunately, in some cases, the VFS will do some additional sanity
checks on the file, and may override the server's decision to allow
the open because it sees the wrong owner/group fields.
