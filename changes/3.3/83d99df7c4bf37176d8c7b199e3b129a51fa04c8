x86, bitops: Move fls64.h inside __KERNEL__

We would include <asm-generic/bitops/fls64.h> even without __KERNEL__,
but that doesn't make sense, as:

1. That file provides fls64(), but the corresponding function fls() is
   not exported to user space.
2. The implementation of fls64.h uses kernel-only symbols.
3. fls64.h is not exported to user space.

This appears to have been a bug introduced in checkin:
