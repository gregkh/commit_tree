block, cfq: misc updates to cfq_io_context

Make the following changes to prepare for ioc/cic management cleanup.

* Add cic->q so that ioc can determine the associated queue without
  querying cfq.  This will eventually replace ->key.

* Factor out cfq_release_cic() from cic_free_func().  This function
  assumes that the caller handled locking.

* Rename __cfq_exit_single_io_context() to cfq_exit_cic() and make it
  take only @cic.

* Restructure cfq_cic_link() for future updates.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
