TTY: extract driver lookup from tty_open

The error handling in tty_open became unbearable. There were many
errors fixed recently. Extract the tty driver lookup from tty_open to
a separate function. This reduces the fail paths significantly and
makes tty_open more readable.

In the next patch we will move the fail path handling to the end of
the function.
