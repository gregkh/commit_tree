MIPS Kprobes: Refactor branch emulation

This patch refactors MIPS branch emulation code so as to allow skipping
delay slot instruction in case of branch likely instructions when branch is
not taken. This is useful for keeping the code common for use cases like
kprobes where one would like to handle the branch instructions keeping the
delay slot instuction also in picture for branch likely instructions. Also
allow emulation when instruction to be decoded is not at pt_regs->cp0_epc
as in case of kprobes where pt_regs->cp0_epc points to the breakpoint
instruction.

The patch also exports the function for modules.
