mlx4_core: Add "native" argument to mlx4_cmd and its callers (where needed)

For SRIOV, some Hypervisor commands can be executed directly (native = 1).
Others should go through the command wrapper flow (for tracking resource
usage, for example, or for changing some HCA configurations that slaves
need to be notified of).

This patch sets the groundwork for this capability -- adding the correct
value of "native" in each case.

Note that if SRIOV is not activated, this parameter has no effect.
