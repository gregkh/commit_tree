TTY: serial, fill uart_port_shutdown

Let's fill the port_ops->shutdown. We will need this for hangup and
close port helpers.

We don't need to touch DTR/RTS registers in uart_port_shutdown. They
are set to off from port_close_start properly already.

Also we don't need to pin the TTY_IO_ERROR bit. This will be done in
close/hangup paths.

We leave uart_shutdown as is, because it is used (and will be) from
several paths now. Like from suspend.

The point is to not touch ASYNC_INITIALIZED bit. It will be set (and
checked) properly by the tty port helpers.
