ARM: 7199/2: only look for TCM on ARMv5 and later

The Integrator AP/CP can have a varying set of core modules, some
(like ARM920T) are so old that trying to read the TCM status register
with CP15 will make them hang. So we need to make sure that we are
running on v5 or later in order to be able to activate this for
the Integrator. (The Integrator with CM926EJ-S has 32+32 kb of TCM
memory.)
