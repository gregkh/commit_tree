rcu: Add rcutorture CPU-hotplug capability

Running CPU-hotplug operations concurrently with rcutorture has
historically been a good way to find bugs in both RCU and CPU hotplug.
This commit therefore adds an rcutorture module parameter called
"onoff_interval" that causes a randomly selected CPU-hotplug operation to
be executed at the specified interval, in seconds.  The default value of
"onoff_interval" is zero, which disables rcutorture-instigated CPU-hotplug
operations.
