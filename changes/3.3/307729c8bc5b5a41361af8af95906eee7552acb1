md/raid1: perform bad-block tests for WriteMostly devices too.

We normally try to avoid reading from write-mostly devices, but when
we do we really have to check for bad blocks and be sure not to
try reading them.

With the current code, best_good_sectors might not get set and that
causes zero-length read requests to be send down which is very
confusing.

This bug was introduced in commit d2eb35acfdccbe2 and so the patch
is suitable for 3.1.x and 3.2.x
