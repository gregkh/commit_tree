powerpc/boot: Add extended precision shifts to the boot wrapper.

The upcomming currituck patches will need to do 64-bit shifts which will
fail with undefined symbol without this patch.

I looked at linking against libgcc but we can't guarantee that libgcc
was compiled with soft-float.  Also Using ../lib/div64.S or
../kernel/misc_32.S, this will break the build as the .o's need to be
built with different flags for the bootwrapper vs the kernel.  So for
now the easyest option is to just copy code from
arch/powerpc/kernel/misc_32.S  I don't think this code changes too often ;P
