x86/Kconfig: Cyclone-timer depends on x86-summit

CONFIG_X86_CYCLONE_TIMER depends on CONFIG_X86_32_NON_STANDARD,
which forces drivers/clocksource/cyclone.c to be compiled. The
file doesn't do anything unless enabled by
arch/x86/kernel/apic/summit_32.c

Make CONFIG_X86_CYCLONE_TIMER depend by X86_SUMMIT instead, to
avoid unnecessary code in other non-standard systems.
