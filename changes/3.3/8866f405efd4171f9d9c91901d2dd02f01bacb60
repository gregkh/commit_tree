ALSA: usb-audio: avoid integer overflow in create_fixed_stream_quirk()

A malicious USB device could feed in a large nr_rates value.  This would
cause the subsequent call to kmemdup() to allocate a smaller buffer than
expected, leading to out-of-bounds access.

This patch validates the nr_rates value and reuses the limit introduced
in commit 4fa0e81b ("ALSA: usb-audio: fix possible hang and overflow
in parse_uac2_sample_rate_range()").
