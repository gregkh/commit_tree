ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: add SYSC_HAS_ENAWAKEUP for dispc

dispc's sysc_flags is missing SYSC_HAS_ENAWAKEUP flag. This seems to
cause SYNC_LOST errors from the DSS when the power management is
enabled.

This patch adds the missing SYSC_HAS_ENAWAKEUP flag. Note that there are
other flags missing also (clock activity, DSI's sysc flags), but as they
are not critical, they will be fixed in the next merge window.
