ACPI, Record ACPI NVS regions

Some firmware will access memory in ACPI NVS region via APEI.  That
is, instructions in APEI ERST/EINJ table will read/write ACPI NVS
region.  The original resource conflict checking in APEI code will
check memory/ioport accessed by APEI via general resource management
mechanism.  But ACPI NVS region is marked as busy already, so that the
false resource conflict will prevent APEI ERST/EINJ to work.

To fix this, this patch record ACPI NVS regions, so that we can avoid
request resources for memory region inside it.
