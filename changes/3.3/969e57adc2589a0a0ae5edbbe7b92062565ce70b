mtd: mtdchar: rename functions

We are going to re-work the MTD interface and change 'mtd->write()' to
'mtd_write()', 'mtd->read()' to 'mtd_read()' and so forth for all functions
in the 'struct mtd_info' structure.

However, mtdchar.c has its own 'mtd_read()', 'mtd_write()', etc functions
which collide with our changes. This patch renames these functions
to 'mtdchar_read()', 'mtdchar_write()', etc.

Additionally, to make the 'mtdchar.c' file look consistent, rename
similarly all the other functions starting with 'mtd_'.
