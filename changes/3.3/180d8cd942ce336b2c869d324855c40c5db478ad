foundations of per-cgroup memory pressure controlling.

This patch replaces all uses of struct sock fields' memory_pressure,
memory_allocated, sockets_allocated, and sysctl_mem to acessor
macros. Those macros can either receive a socket argument, or a mem_cgroup
argument, depending on the context they live in.

Since we're only doing a macro wrapping here, no performance impact at all is
expected in the case where we don't have cgroups disabled.
