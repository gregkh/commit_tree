net: fix sock_clone reference mismatch with tcp memcontrol

Sockets can also be created through sock_clone. Because it copies
all data in the sock structure, it also copies the memcg-related pointer,
and all should be fine. However, since we now use reference counts in
socket creation, we are left with some sockets that have no reference
counts. It matters when we destroy them, since it leads to a mismatch.
