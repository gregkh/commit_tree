inet_diag: Switch from _GETSOCK to IPPROTO_ numbers

Sorry, but the vger didn't let this message go to the list. Re-sending it with
less spam-filter-prone subject.

When dumping the AF_INET/AF_INET6 sockets user will also specify the protocol,
so prepare the protocol diag handlers to work with IPPROTO_ constants.
