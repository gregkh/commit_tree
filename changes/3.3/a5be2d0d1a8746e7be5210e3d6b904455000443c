freezer: rename thaw_process() to __thaw_task() and simplify the implementation

thaw_process() now has only internal users - system and cgroup
freezers.  Remove the unnecessary return value, rename, unexport and
collapse __thaw_process() into it.  This will help further updates to
the freezer code.

-v3: oom_kill grew a use of thaw_process() while this patch was
     pending.  Convert it to use __thaw_task() for now.  In the longer
     term, this should be handled by allowing tasks to die if killed
     even if it's frozen.

-v2: minor style update as suggested by Matt.
