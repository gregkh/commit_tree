x86, opcode: ANDN and Group 17 in x86-opcode-map.txt

The Intel documentation at

http://software.intel.com/file/36945

shows the ANDN opcode and Group 17 with encoding f2 and f3 encoding
respectively.  The current version of x86-opcode-map.txt shows them
with f3 and f4.  Unless someone can point to documentation which shows
the currently used encoding the following patch be applied.
