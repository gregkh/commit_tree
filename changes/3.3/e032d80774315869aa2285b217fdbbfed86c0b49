mce: fix warning messages about static struct mce_device

When suspending, there was a large list of warnings going something like:

	Device 'machinecheck1' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed

This patch turns the static mce_devices into dynamically allocated, and
properly frees them when they are removed from the system.  It solves
the warning messages on my laptop here.
