staging: android: ramconsole: Ensure ramconsole does not get cluttered by apanic threads

[Note, this is part of a patch from Sam, just the drivers/staging/
portion, that adds a function that the apanic code calls, but the apanic
code isn't here, so just include part of this to make merges and diffs
easier and this keeps things self-contained - gregkh]
