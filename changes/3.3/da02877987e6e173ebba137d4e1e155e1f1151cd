ARM: LPAE: Page table maintenance for the 3-level format

This patch modifies the pgd/pmd/pte manipulation functions to support
the 3-level page table format. Since there is no need for an 'ext'
argument to cpu_set_pte_ext(), this patch conditionally defines a
different prototype for this function when CONFIG_ARM_LPAE.

The patch also introduces the L_PGD_SWAPPER flag to mark pgd entries
pointing to pmd tables pre-allocated in the swapper_pg_dir and avoid
trying to free them at run-time. This flag is 0 with the classic page
table format.
