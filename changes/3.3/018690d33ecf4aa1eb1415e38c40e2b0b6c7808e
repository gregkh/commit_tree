regmap: Allow regmap_update_bits() users to detect changes

Some users of regmap_update_bits() would like to be able to tell their
users if they actually did an update so provide a variant which also
returns a flag indicating if an update took place. We could return a
tristate in the return value of regmap_update_bits() but this makes the
API more cumbersome to use and doesn't fit with the general zero for
success idiom we have.
