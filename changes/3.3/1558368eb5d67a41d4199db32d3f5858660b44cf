ARM: vic: MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER handler

Add a handler for the VIC that is suitable for MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER
platforms.  This can replace the ASM entry macros for platforms that use
the VIC.

v4:	- rebase ontop of move __exception and friends to
	  asm/exception.h
	- rework polling loop to handle as many irqs as possible in one go
v3:	- simplify irq handling loop as suggested by Grant
	- service interrupts from msb->lsb order
v2:	- allow the handler be used for !CONFIG_OF
	- use irq_domain_to_irq()
