mac80211: use skb list for fragments

We are currently linking the skbs by using skb->next
directly. This works, but the preferred way is to use
a struct sk_buff_head instead. That also prepares for
passing that to drivers directly.

While at it I noticed we calculate the duration for
fragments twice -- remove one of them.
