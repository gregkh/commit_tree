staging: android: switch: switch class and GPIO drivers.

This adds the Android switch driver code to the staging tree.

[Note, this code was located in drivers/switch/ in the Android kernel
releases, but as that api wasn't generally accepted, and the interface
is working toward changing to the newly proposed extcon inteface, this
driver was placed here until the extcon code is merged into mainline and
the Android userspace code is converted over to using it. - gregkh]
