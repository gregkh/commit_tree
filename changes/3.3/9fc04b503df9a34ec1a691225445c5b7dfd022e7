drm/radeon: avoid deadlock if GPU lockup is detected in ib_pool_get

If GPU lockup is detected in ib_pool get we are holding the ib_pool
mutex that will be needed by the GPU reset code. As ib_pool code is
safe to be reentrant from GPU reset code we should not block if we
are trying to get the ib pool lock on the behalf of the same userspace
caller, thus use the radeon_mutex_lock helper.
