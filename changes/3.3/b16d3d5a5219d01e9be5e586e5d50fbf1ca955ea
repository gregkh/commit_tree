mm: compaction: use synchronous compaction for /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory

When asynchronous compaction was introduced, the
/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory handler should have been updated to always use
synchronous compaction.  This did not happen so this patch addresses it.

The assumption is if a user writes to /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory, they
are willing for that process to stall.
