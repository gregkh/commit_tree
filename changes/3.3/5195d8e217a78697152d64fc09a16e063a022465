audit: dynamically allocate audit_names when not enough space is in the names array

This patch does 2 things.  First it reduces the number of audit_names
allocated in every audit context from 20 to 5.  5 should be enough for all
'normal' syscalls (rename being the worst).  Some syscalls can still touch
more the 5 inodes such as mount.  When rpc filesystem is mounted it will
create inodes and those can exceed 5.  To handle that problem this patch will
dynamically allocate audit_names if it needs more than 5.  This should
decrease the typicall memory usage while still supporting all the possible
kernel operations.
