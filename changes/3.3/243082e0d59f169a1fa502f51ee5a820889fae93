xen/gntalloc: fix reference counts on multi-page mappings

When a multi-page mapping of gntalloc is created, the reference counts
of all pages in the vma are incremented. However, the vma open/close
operations only adjusted the reference count of the first page in the
mapping, leaking the other pages. Store a struct in the vm_private_data
to track the original page count to properly free the pages when the
last reference to the vma is closed.
