block: misc ioc cleanups

* int return from put_io_context() wasn't used by anybody.  Make it
  return void like other put functions and docbook-fy the function
  comment.

* Reorder dummy declarations for !CONFIG_BLOCK case a bit.

* Make alloc_ioc_context() use __GFP_ZERO allocation, take init out of
  if block and drop 0'ing.

* Docbook-fy current_io_context() comment.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
