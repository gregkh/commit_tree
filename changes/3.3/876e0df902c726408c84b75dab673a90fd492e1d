usb: Remove ehci_reset call from ehci_run

Remove the ehci_reset() call done in the ehci_run() routine of the
USB EHCI host controller driver and add an ehci_reset() call to the
probe processing of all EHCI platform drivers that do not already call
ehci_reset().

The call to ehci_reset() from ehci_run() was problematic for several
platform drivers, and unnecessary for others.  This change moves the
decision to call ehci_reset() at driver startup to the platform
driver code.
