memcg: clear pc->mem_cgroup if necessary.

This is a preparation before removing a flag PCG_ACCT_LRU in page_cgroup
and reducing atomic ops/complexity in memcg LRU handling.

In some cases, pages are added to lru before charge to memcg and pages
are not classfied to memory cgroup at lru addtion.  Now, the lru where
the page should be added is determined a bit in page_cgroup->flags and
pc->mem_cgroup.  I'd like to remove the check of flag.

To handle the case pc->mem_cgroup may contain stale pointers if pages
are added to LRU before classification.  This patch resets
pc->mem_cgroup to root_mem_cgroup before lru additions.
