vmscan: activate executable pages after first usage

Logic added in commit 8cab4754d24a0 ("vmscan: make mapped executable pages
the first class citizen") was noticeably weakened in commit
645747462435d84 ("vmscan: detect mapped file pages used only once").

Currently these pages can become "first class citizens" only after second
usage.  After this patch page_check_references() will activate they after
first usage, and executable code gets yet better chance to stay in memory.
