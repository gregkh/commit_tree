wake up s_wait_unfrozen when ->freeze_fs fails

dd slept infinitely when fsfeeze failed because of EIO.
To fix this problem, if ->freeze_fs fails, freeze_super() wakes up
the tasks waiting for the filesystem to become unfrozen.

When s_frozen isn't SB_UNFROZEN in __generic_file_aio_write(),
the function sleeps until FITHAW ioctl wakes up s_wait_unfrozen.

However, if ->freeze_fs fails, s_frozen is set to SB_UNFROZEN and then
freeze_super() returns an error number. In this case, FITHAW ioctl returns
EINVAL because s_frozen is already SB_UNFROZEN. There is no way to wake up
s_wait_unfrozen, so __generic_file_aio_write() sleeps infinitely.
