md/raid10: fix assembling of arrays with replacement devices.

commit 56a2559bb654a (md/raid10: recognise replacements ...)
changed 'run' to set ->replacement or ->rdev depending on the
'Replacement' status if the device, but it didn't remove the
old unconditional setting of 'rdev'.  So it was largely ineffective.

So remove that now.
