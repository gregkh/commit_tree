backlight: remove ADX backlight device support

Support for the Avionic Design Xanthos backlight device got added in
commit 3b96ea9ef8 ("backlight: Add support for the Avionic Design Xanthos
backlight device.").  That support depends on ARCH_PXA_ADX.  The code that
should have provided that Kconfig symbol never got submitted.  It has
never been possible to even build this driver.  Remove it.
