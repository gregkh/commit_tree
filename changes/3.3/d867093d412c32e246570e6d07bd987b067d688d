ARM: OMAP2+: Remove apply_uV constraints for fixed regulator

VUSB is a fixed regulator, so get rid of the apply_uV constraint
for it, which fixes the following error seen at boot on omap4
SDP and PANDA boards.

machine_constraints_voltage: VUSB: failed to apply 3300000uV constraint
twl_reg twl_reg.46: can't register VUSB, -22
twl_reg: probe of twl_reg.46 failed with error -22
