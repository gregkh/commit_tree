x86/kprobes: Add arch/x86/tools/insn_sanity to .gitignore

After compiling the kernel, I got:

	% git status
	# On branch master
	# Untracked files:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	#
	#	arch/x86/tools/insn_sanity
	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

it should be added to .gitignore.
