ARM: 7293/1: logical_cpu_map: decouple CPU mapping from SMP

It turns out that the logical CPU mapping is useful even when !CONFIG_SMP
for manipulation of devices like interrupt and power controllers when
running a UP kernel on a CPU other than 0. This can happen when kexecing
a UP image from an SMP kernel.

In the future, multi-cluster systems running AMP configurations will
require something similar for mapping cluster IDs, so it makes sense to
decouple this logic in preparation for this support.
