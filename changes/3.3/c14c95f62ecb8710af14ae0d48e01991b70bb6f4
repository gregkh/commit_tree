ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix overflow of vol/sw check bitmap

The bitmap introduced in the commit [527e4d73: ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix
missing volume controls with ALC260] is too narrow for some codecs,
which may have more NIDs than 0x20, thus it may overflow the bitmap
array on them.

Just double the number to cover all and also add a sanity-check code
to be safer.
