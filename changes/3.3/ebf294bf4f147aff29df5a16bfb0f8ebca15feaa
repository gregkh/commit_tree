perf tools: Simplify debugfs mountpoint handling code

We don't need to have two PATH_MAX char sized arrays holding it, just
one in util/debugfs.c will do.

Also rename debugfs_path to tracing_events_path, as it is not the path
to debugfs, that is debugfs_mountpoint. Both are now accessible.

This will allow accessing this code in the perf python binding without
having to drag in perf.c and util/parse-events.c.

The defaults for these variables are the canonical "/sys/kernel/debug"
and "/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/", removing the need for simple
tools to call debugfs_mount(NULL).
