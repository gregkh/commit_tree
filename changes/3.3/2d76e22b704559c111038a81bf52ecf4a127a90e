[media] mb86a20s: convert set_fontend to use DVBv5 parameters

Instead of using dvb_frontend_parameters struct, that were
designed for a subset of the supported standards, use the DVBv5
cache information.

Actually, this driver needs to fill/use the ISDB-T proprieties.

Also, fill the supported delivery systems at dvb_frontend_ops
struct.
