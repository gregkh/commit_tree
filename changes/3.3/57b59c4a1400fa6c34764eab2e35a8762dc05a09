coredump_wait: don't call complete_vfork_done()

Now that CLONE_VFORK is killable, coredump_wait() no longer needs
complete_vfork_done().  zap_threads() should find and kill all tasks with
the same ->mm, this includes our parent if ->vfork_done is set.

mm_release() becomes the only caller, unexport complete_vfork_done().
