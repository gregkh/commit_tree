can: flexcan: fix irq flooding by clearing all interrupt sources

As pointed out by Reuben Dowle and Lothar Waßmann, the TWRN_INT,
RWRN_INT, BOFF_INT interrupt sources need to be cleared as well
to avoid interrupt flooding, at least for the Flexcan on i.MX28
SOCs. Furthermore, the interrupts are only cleared, if really one
of those interrupt sources are pending (which is not the case for
rx and tx done).
