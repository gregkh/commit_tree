ASoC: Refactor some conditions and loop in soc_bind_dai_link()

Transform some loops from:

for_each(x) {
    if (f(x)) {
        work_on(x);
    }
}

to new structure:

for_each(x) {
    if (!f(x))
        continue;

    work_on(x);
}

This will allow future modification of f(x) with less impact to the code.
