iommu/omap: fix erroneous omap-iommu-debug API calls

Adapt omap-iommu-debug to the latest omap-iommu API changes, which
were introduced by commit fabdbca "iommu/omap: eliminate the public
omap_find_iommu_device() method".

In a nutshell, iommu users are not expected to provide the omap_iommu
handle anymore - instead, iommus are attached using their user's device
handle.

omap-iommu-debug is a hybrid beast though: it invokes both public and
private omap iommu API, so fix it as necessary (otherwise a crash
is imminent).

Note: omap-iommu-debug is a bit disturbing, as it fiddles with internal
omap iommu data and requires exposing API which is otherwise not needed.
It should better be more tightly coupled with omap-iommu, to prevent
further bit rot and avoid exposing redundant API. Naturally that's out
of scope for the -rc cycle, so for now just fix the obvious.
