unix_diag: Dumping exact socket core

The socket inode is used as a key for lookup. This is effectively
the only really unique ID of a unix socket, but using this for
search currently has one problem -- it is O(number of sockets) :(

Does it worth fixing this lookup or inventing some other ID for
unix sockets?
