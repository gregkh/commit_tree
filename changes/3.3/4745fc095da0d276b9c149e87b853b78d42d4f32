nl80211: add testmode to the list of supported commands

User space might want to test if driver supports testmode. Adding testmode
to the list of supported commands makes this easier.

I omitted testmode_dump() in purpose. I assume all drivers implementing
testmode_dump() will also implement testmode_cmd().
