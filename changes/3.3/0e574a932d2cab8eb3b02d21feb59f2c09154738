mm: memcg: clean up fault accounting

The fault accounting functions have a single, memcg-internal user, so they
don't need to be global.  In fact, their one-line bodies can be directly
folded into the caller.  And since faults happen one at a time, use
this_cpu_inc() directly instead of this_cpu_add(foo, 1).
