openrisc: Fix up audit_syscall_[entry|exit]() usage

Commits d7e7528bcd456f5c36ad4a202ccfb43c5aa98bc4 and
b05d8447e7821695bc2fa3359431f7a664232743 simplified the usage of the
audit_syscall_[entry|exit] functions.  Unfortunately, the OpenRISC
architecture didn't get fixed up along with the other architectures when
those patches were pushed.  This makes the relevant changes to this
architecture.
