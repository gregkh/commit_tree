target: Set additional sense length field in sense data

The target code was not setting the additional sense length field in the
sense data it returned, which meant that at least the Linux stack
ignored the ASC/ASCQ fields.  For example, without this patch, on a
tcm_loop device:

    # sg_raw -v /dev/sda 2 0 0 0 0 0

gives

        cdb to send: 02 00 00 00 00 00
    SCSI Status: Check Condition

    Sense Information:
     Fixed format, current;  Sense key: Illegal Request
      Raw sense data (in hex):
            70 00 05 00 00 00 00 00

while after the patch we correctly get the following (which matches what
a regular disk returns):

        cdb to send: 02 00 00 00 00 00
    SCSI Status: Check Condition

    Sense Information:
     Fixed format, current;  Sense key: Illegal Request
     Additional sense: Invalid command operation code
     Raw sense data (in hex):
            70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0a  00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00
            00 00
