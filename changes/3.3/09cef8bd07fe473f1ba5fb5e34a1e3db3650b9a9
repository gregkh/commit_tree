powerpc/85xx: Add lbc suspend support for PM

Power supply for LBC registers is off when system go to deep-sleep state.
We save the values of registers before suspend and restore to registers
after resume.

We removed the last two reservation arrays from struct fsl_lbc_regs for
allocating less memory and minimizing the memcpy size.
