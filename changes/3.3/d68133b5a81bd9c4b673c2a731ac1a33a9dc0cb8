ARM: 7299/1: ftrace: clear zero bit in reported IPs for Thumb-2

The dynamic ftrace ops startup test currently fails on Thumb-2 kernels:

 Testing tracer function: PASSED
 Testing dynamic ftrace: PASSED
 Testing dynamic ftrace ops #1: (0 0 0 0 0) FAILED!

This is because while the addresses in the mcount records do not have
the zero bit set, the IP reported by the mcount call does have it set
(because it is copied from the LR).  This mismatch causes the ops
filtering in ftrace_ops_list_func() to not call the relevant tracers.

Fix this by clearing the zero bit before adjusting the LR for the mcount
instruction size.  Also, combine the mov+sub into a single sub
instruction.
