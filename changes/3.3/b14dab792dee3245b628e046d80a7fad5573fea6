DMAEngine: Define interleaved transfer request api

Define a new api that could be used for doing fancy data transfers
like interleaved to contiguous copy and vice-versa.
Traditional SG_list based transfers tend to be very inefficient in
such cases as where the interleave and chunk are only a few bytes,
which call for a very condensed api to convey pattern of the transfer.
This api supports all 4 variants of scatter-gather and contiguous transfer.

Of course, neither can this api help transfers that don't lend to DMA by
nature, i.e, scattered tiny read/writes with no periodic pattern.

Also since now we support SLAVE channels that might not provide
device_prep_slave_sg callback but device_prep_interleaved_dma,
remove the BUG_ON check.
