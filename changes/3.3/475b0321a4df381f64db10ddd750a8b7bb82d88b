md/raid10: writes should get directed to replacement as well as original.

When writing, we need to submit two writes, one to the original,
and one to the replacements - if there is a replacement.

If the write to the replacement results in a write error we just
fail the device.  We only try to record write errors to the
original.

This only handles writing new data.  Writing for resync/recovery
will come later.
