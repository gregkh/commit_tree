m68k: set register a2 to current if MMU enabled on ColdFire

Virtual memory m68k systems build with register a2 dedicated to being the
current proc pointer (non-MMU don't do this). Add code to the ColdFire
interrupt and exception processing to set this on entry, and at context
switch time. We use the same GET_CURRENT() macro that MMU enabled code
uses - modifying it so that the assembler is ColdFire clean.
