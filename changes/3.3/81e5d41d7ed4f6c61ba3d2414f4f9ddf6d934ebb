openvswitch: Fix checksum update for actions on UDP packets.

When modifying IP addresses or ports on a UDP packet we don't
correctly follow the rules for unchecksummed packets.  This meant
that packets without a checksum can be given a incorrect new checksum
and packets with a checksum can become marked as being unchecksummed.
This fixes it to handle those requirements.
