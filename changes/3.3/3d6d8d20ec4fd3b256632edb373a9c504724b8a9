pstore: pass reason to backend write callback

This allows a backend to filter on the dmesg reason as well as the pstore
reason. When ramoops is switched to pstore, this is needed since it has
no interest in storing non-crash dmesg details.

Drop pstore_write() as it has no users, and handling the "reason" here
has no obviously correct value.
