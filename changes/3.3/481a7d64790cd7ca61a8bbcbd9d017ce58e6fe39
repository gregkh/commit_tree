block: fix drain_all condition in blk_drain_queue()

When trying to drain all requests, blk_drain_queue() checked only
q->rq.count[]; however, this only tracks REQ_ALLOCED requests.  This
patch updates blk_drain_queue() such that it looks at all the counters
and queues so that request_queue is actually empty on completion.
