freezer: remove racy clear_freeze_flag() and set PF_NOFREEZE on dead tasks

clear_freeze_flag() in exit_mm() is racy.  Freezing can start
afterwards.  Remove it.  Skipping freezer for exiting task will be
properly implemented later.

Also, freezable() was testing exit_state directly to make system
freezer ignore dead tasks.  Let the exiting task set PF_NOFREEZE after
entering TASK_DEAD instead.
