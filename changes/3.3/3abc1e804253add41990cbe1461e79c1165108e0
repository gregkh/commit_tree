mmc: sdhci: restore the enabled dma when do reset all

If dma is enabled, it'll be cleared when reset all is performed, this can
be observed on some platforms, such as P2041 which has a version 2.3
controller, but platform like P4080 which has a version 2.2 controller,
does not suffer this, so we will check if the dma is enabled, we should
restore it after reset all.
