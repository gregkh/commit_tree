ARM: OMAP4: PM: Keep static dep between MPUSS-EMIF and MPUSS-L3/L4 and DUCATI-L3

As per OMAP4430 TRM, the dynamic dependency between MPUSS -> EMIF
and MPUSS -> L4PER/L3_* and DUCATI -> L3_* clockdomains is enable
by default. Refer register CM_MPU_DYNAMICDEP description for details.

But these dynamic dependencies doesn't work as expected. The hardware
recommendation is to enable static dependencies for above clockdomains.
Without this, system locks up or randomly crashes.
