USB: make the usbfs memory limit configurable

The 16-MB global limit on memory used by usbfs isn't suitable for all
people.  It's a reasonable default, but there are applications
(especially for SuperSpeed devices) that need a lot more.

This patch (as1498) creates a writable module parameter for usbcore to
control the global limit.  The default is still 16 MB, but users can
change it at runtime, even after usbcore has been loaded.  As a
special case, setting the value to 0 is treated the same as the hard
limit of 2047 MB.
