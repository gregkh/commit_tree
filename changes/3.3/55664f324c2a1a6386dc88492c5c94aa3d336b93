ethtool: Allow drivers to select RX NFC rule locations

Define special location values for RX NFC that request the driver to
select the actual rule location.  This allows for implementation on
devices that use hash-based filter lookup, whereas currently the API is
more suited to devices with TCAM lookup or linear search.

In ethtool_set_rxnfc() and the compat wrapper ethtool_ioctl(), copy
the structure back to user-space after insertion so that the actual
location is returned.
