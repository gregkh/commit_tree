net_sched: sfq: fix mem alloc error recovery

Since commit 817fb15dfd98 (net_sched: sfq: allow divisor to be a
parameter), we can leave perturbation timer armed if a memory allocation
error aborts sfq_init().

Memory containing active struct timer_list is freed and kernel can
crash.

Call sfq_destroy() from sfq_init() to properly dismantle qdisc.
