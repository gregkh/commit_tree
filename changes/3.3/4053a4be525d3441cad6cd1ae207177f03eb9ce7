[SCSI] be2iscsi: cleanup a min_t() call

"sense_len" was declared as int type but actually it only stores a
u16 value that comes from hardware.  The cast to u16 in min_t()
confuses static analysis because it truncates the int to u16 so I've
fixed the declaration to reflect that "sense_len" is just a u16.

Also there was a call to cpu_to_be16() which I've changed to
be16_to_cpu().  The functions are equivalent, but obviously the
hardware is big endian and we're doing the min_t() comparison on CPU
endian values.

This whole patch is just a cleanup and doesn't affect how the code
works.
