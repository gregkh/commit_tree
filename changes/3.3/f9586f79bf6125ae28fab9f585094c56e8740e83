vlan: add rtnl_dereference() annotations

The original code generates a Sparse warning:
net/8021q/vlan_core.c:336:9:
	error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)

It's ok to dereference __rcu pointers here because we are holding the
RTNL lock.  I've added some calls to rtnl_dereference() to silence the
warning.
