drivers/leds/leds-lm3530.c: fix setting pltfm->als_vmax

In current code, pltfm->als_vmin is set to LM3530_ALS_WINDOW_mV and
pltfm->als_vmax is 0.  This does not make sense.  I think what we want
here is setting pltfm->als_vmax to LM3530_ALS_WINDOW_mV.

Both als_vmin and als_vmax local variables will be set to
pltfm->als_vmin and pltfm->als_vmax by a few lines latter.  Thus also
remove a redundant assignment for als_vmin and als_vmax in this patch.
