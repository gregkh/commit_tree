ALSA: hda - Fix the lost power-setup of seconary pins after PM resume

When multiple headphone or other detectable output pins are present,
the power-map has to be updated after resume appropriately, but the
current driver doesn't check all pins but only the first pin (since
it's enough to check it for the mute-behavior).  This resulted in the
silent output from the secondary outputs after PM resume.

This patch fixes the problem by checking all pins at (re-)init time.
