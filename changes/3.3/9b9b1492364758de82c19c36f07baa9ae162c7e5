KVM: MMU: Split gfn_to_rmap() into two functions

rmap_write_protect() calls gfn_to_rmap() for each level with gfn fixed.
This results in calling gfn_to_memslot() repeatedly with that gfn.

This patch introduces __gfn_to_rmap() which takes the slot as an
argument to avoid this.

This is also needed for the following dirty logging optimization.
