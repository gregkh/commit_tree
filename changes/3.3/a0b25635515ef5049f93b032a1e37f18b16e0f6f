drm/nouveau/gpio: reimplement as nouveau_gpio.c, fixing a number of issues

- moves out of nouveau_bios.c and demagics the logical state definitions
- simplifies chipset-specific driver interface
- makes most of gpio irq handling common, will use for nv4x hpd later
- api extended to allow both direct gpio access, and access using the
  logical function states
- api extended to allow for future use of gpio extender chips
- pre-nv50 was handled very badly, the main issue being that all GPIOs
  were being treated as output-only.
- fixes nvd0 so gpio changes actually stick, magic reg needs bashing
