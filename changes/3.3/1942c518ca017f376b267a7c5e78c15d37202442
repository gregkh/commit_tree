inet_diag: Generalize inet_diag dump and get_exact calls

Introduce two callbacks in inet_diag_handler -- one for dumping all
sockets (with filters) and the other one for dumping a single sk.

Replace direct calls to icsk handlers with indirect calls to callbacks
provided by handlers.

Make existing TCP and DCCP handlers use provided helpers for icsk-s.

The UDP diag module will provide its own.
