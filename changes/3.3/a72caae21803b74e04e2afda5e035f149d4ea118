virtio: correct the memory barrier in virtqueue_kick_prepare()

Use virtio_mb() to make sure the available index to be exposed before
checking the the avail event. Otherwise we may get stale value of
avail event in guest and never kick the host after.

Note: this fixes a bug introduced by ee7cd8981e15bcb365fc762afe3fc47b8242f630.
