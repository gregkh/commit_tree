eeprom_93cx6: Add data direction control.

Some devices need to know if the data is to be output or read, so add a
data direction into the eeprom structure to tell the driver whether the
data line should be driven.

The user in this case is the Micrel KS8851 which has a direction
control for the EEPROM data line and thus needs to know whether
to drive it (writing) or to tristate it for receiving.
