mac80211: Call driver commands after drv_start in mac80211 restart code

Ideally, hardware/firmware initialization is complete after the
drv_start routine. In mac80211 restart code (ieee80211_reconfig),
defer calling the driver commands i.e. setup fragmentation
threshold, rts threshold and coverage class till drv_start
routine is called.
