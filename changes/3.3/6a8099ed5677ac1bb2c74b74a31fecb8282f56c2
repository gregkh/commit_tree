GFS2: Fix multi-block allocation

Clean up gfs2_alloc_blocks so that it takes the full extent length
rather than just the number of non-inode blocks as an argument. That
will only make a difference in the inode allocation case for now.

Also, this fixes the extent length handling around gfs2_alloc_extent() so
that multi block allocations will work again.

The rd_last_alloc block is set to the final block in the allocated
extent (as per the update to i_goal, but referenced to a different
start point).

This also removes the dinode argument to rgblk_search() which is no
longer used.
