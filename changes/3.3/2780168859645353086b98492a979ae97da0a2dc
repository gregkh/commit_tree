[media] OMAP_VOUT: CLEANUP: Remove redundant code from omap_vout_isr

Currently, there is a lot of redundant code is between DPI and VENC panels, this
can be made common by moving out field/interlace specific code to a separate
function called omapvid_handle_interlace_display(). There is no functional
change made.
