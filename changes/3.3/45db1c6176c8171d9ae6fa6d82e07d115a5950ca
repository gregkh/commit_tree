x86, um: Use the same style generated syscall tables as native

Now when the native kernel uses a single style of generated system
call table, follow suite for UML and implement the same style, all in
C.  This requires __NR_syscall_max and NR_syscalls to be generated; on
native this is done in asm-headers.h but that file is common to all
UML architectures; therefore put it in user-headers.h instead which
already have accommodations for architecture-specific values.
