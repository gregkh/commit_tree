TTY: serial, extract uart_port_startup

Extract ASYNC_INITIALIZED/TTY_IO_ERROR handling from uart_startup.
This will be useful for tty port helpers. These flags are handled
by the helpers instead.

So we create a new function uart_port_startup without touching these
flags there. And we keep uart_startup with the exact behavior as
before. We need that one because we start/stop the device from other
paths than open/close/hangup.
