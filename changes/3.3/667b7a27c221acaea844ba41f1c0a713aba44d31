drm/ttm: remove split btw highmen and lowmem page

Split btw highmem and lowmem page was rendered useless by the
pool code. Remove it. Note further cleanup would change the
ttm page allocation helper to actualy take an array instead
of relying on list this could drasticly reduce the number of
function call in the common case of allocation whole buffer.
