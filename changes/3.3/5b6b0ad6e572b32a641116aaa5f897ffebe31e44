mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix for mmc cards on i.MX5

On i.MX53 we have to write a special SDHCI_CMD_ABORTCMD to the
SDHCI_TRANSFER_MODE register during a MMC_STOP_TRANSMISSION
command. This works for SD cards. However, with MMC cards
the MMC_SET_BLOCK_COUNT command is used instead, but this
needs the same handling. Fix MMC cards by testing for the
MMC_SET_BLOCK_COUNT command aswell. Tested on a custom i.MX53
board with a Transcend MMC+ card and eMMC.

The kernel started used MMC_SET_BLOCK_COUNT in 3.0, so this
is a regression for these boards introduced in 3.0; it should
go to 3.0/3.1/3.2-stable.
