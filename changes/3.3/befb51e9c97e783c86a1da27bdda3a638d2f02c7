drm/nouveau/disp: parse connector info directly in nouveau_connector.c

Another case where we parsed vbios data to some structs, then again use
that info once to construct another set of data.  Skip the intermediate
step.

This is also slightly improved in that we can now use DCB 3.x connector
table info, which will allow NV4x to gain hotplug support, and to make
quirks for SPWG LVDS panels unnecessary.
