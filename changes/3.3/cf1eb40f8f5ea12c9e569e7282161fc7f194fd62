[S390] correct ktime to tod clock comparator conversion

The conversion of the ktime to a value suitable for the clock comparator
does not take changes to wall_to_monotonic into account. In fact the
conversion just needs the boot clock (sched_clock_base_cc) and the
total_sleep_time.

This is applicable to 3.2+ kernels.
