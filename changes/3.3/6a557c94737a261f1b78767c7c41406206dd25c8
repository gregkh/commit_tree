ALSA: hda - GPIO to control mute LED may be enabled on HP systems with no such HW

This may lead to problems (like loss of sound) as GPIO pin may be used
for different function (SPDIF OUT, EAPD etc) on those systems. This patch
disables default mute LED GPIO configuration on all new codecs as all new
HP systems are expected to provide explicit mute LED configuration in SMBIOS.
