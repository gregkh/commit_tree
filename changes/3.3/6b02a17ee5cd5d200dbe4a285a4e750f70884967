staging: line6: fixed ALSA/PCM interaction

The PCM subsystem in the Line6 driver is mainly used for PCM playback and
capture by ALSA, but also has other tasks, most notably providing a
low-latency software monitor for devices which don't support hardware
monitoring (e.g., the TonePort series). This patch makes ALSA "play nicely"
with the other components, i.e., prevents it from resetting the isochronous
USB transfer while other PCM tasks (software monitoring) are running.
