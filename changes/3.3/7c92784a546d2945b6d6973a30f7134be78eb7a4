I2C: Add helper macro for i2c_driver boilerplate

This patch introduces the module_i2c_driver macro which is a convenience macro
for I2C driver modules similar to module_platform_driver. It is intended to be
used by drivers which init/exit section does nothing but register/unregister
the I2C driver. By using this macro it is possible to eliminate a few lines of
boilerplate code per I2C driver.
