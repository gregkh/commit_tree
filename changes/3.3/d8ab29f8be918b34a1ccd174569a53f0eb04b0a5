rcu: Remove one layer of abstraction from PROVE_RCU checking

Simplify things a bit by substituting the definitions of the single-line
rcu_read_acquire(), rcu_read_release(), rcu_read_acquire_bh(),
rcu_read_release_bh(), rcu_read_acquire_sched(), and
rcu_read_release_sched() functions at their call points.
