[S390] dasd: revert LCU optimization

Remove the optimization that validate server is only called once per
LCU. If a device is set online we only know that we already know the
LCU. But if the pathgroup was lost in between we have to do a
validate server again to activate some features.
Since we have no indication when a pathgroup gets lost we have to do
a validate server every time a device is set online.
