block: add missing blk_queue_dead() checks

blk_insert_cloned_request(), blk_execute_rq_nowait() and
blk_flush_plug_list() either didn't check whether the queue was dead
or did it without holding queue_lock.  Update them so that dead state
is checked while holding queue_lock.

AFAICS, this plugs all holes (requeue doesn't matter as the request is
transitioning atomically from in_flight to queued).
