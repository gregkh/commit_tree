inet: remove rcu protection on tw_net

commit b099ce2602d806 (net: Batch inet_twsk_purge) added rcu protection
on tw_net for no obvious reason.

struct net are refcounted anyway since timewait sockets escape from rcu
protected sections. tw_net stay valid for the whole timwait lifetime.

This also removes a lot of sparse errors.
