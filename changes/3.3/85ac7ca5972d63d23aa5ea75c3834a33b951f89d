[S390] outstanding interrupts vs. smp_send_stop

The panic function will first print the panic message to the console,
then stop additional cpus with smp_send_stop and finally call the
function on the panic notifier list.
In case of an I/O based console the panic message will cause I/O to
be started and a function on the panic notifier list will wait for the
completion of the I/O. That does not work if an I/O completion interrupt
has already been delivered to a cpu that is then stopped by smp_send_stop.
To break this cyclic dependency add code to smp_send_stop that gives
the additional cpu the opportunity to complete outstanding interrupts.
