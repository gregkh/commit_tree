[media] rc-videomate-m1f.c Rename to match remote controler name

This remote was added with support for card Compro VideoMate M1F.

This remote is shipped with various Compro cards, not this one only.

Furthermore this remote can be bought separately under name Compro
VideoMate K100.

So give it a proper name.
