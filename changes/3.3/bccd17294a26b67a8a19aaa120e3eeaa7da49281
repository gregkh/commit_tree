x86: Get rid of 'dubious one-bit signed bitfield' sprase warning

This very noisy sparse warning appears on almost every file in the
kernel:

  CHECK   init/main.c
  arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h:43:55: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
  arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h:44:46: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield

This patch changes sig_on_uaccess_error and uaccess_err flags to unsigned
type and thus fixes the warning.
