block: fix lockdep warning on io_context release put_io_context()

11a3122f6c "block: strip out locking optimization in put_io_context()"
removed ioc_lock depth lockdep annoation along with locking
optimization; however, while recursing from put_io_context() is no
longer possible, ioc_release_fn() may still end up putting the last
reference of another ioc through elevator, which wlil grab ioc->lock
triggering spurious (as the ioc is always different one) A-A deadlock
warning.

As this can only happen one time from ioc_release_fn(), using non-zero
subclass from ioc_release_fn() is enough.  Use subclass 1.
