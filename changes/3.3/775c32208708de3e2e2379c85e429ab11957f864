mtd: gpio-nand: add device tree bindings

Add device tree bindings so that the gpio-nand driver may be
instantiated from the device tree.  This also allows the partitions
to be specified in the device tree.

v7:	- restore runtime device tree/non device tree detection
v6:	- convert to mtd_device_parse_register()
v5:	- fold dt config helpers into a single gpio_nand_of_get_config()
v4:	- get io sync address from gpio-control-nand,io-sync-reg
	  property rather than a resource
	- clarified a few details in the binding
v3:	- remove redundant cast and a couple of whitespace/naming
	  changes
v2:	- add CONFIG_OF guards for non-dt platforms
	- compatible becomes gpio-control-nand
	- clarify some binding details
