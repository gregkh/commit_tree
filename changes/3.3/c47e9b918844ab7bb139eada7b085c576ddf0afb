tipc: Eliminate dynamic allocation of broadcast link data structures

Creates global variables to hold the broadcast link's pseudo-bearer and
pseudo-link structures, rather than allocating them dynamically. There
is only a single instance of each structure, and changing over to static
allocation allows elimination of code to handle the cases where dynamic
allocation was unsuccessful.

The memset in the teardown code may look like they aren't used, but
the same teardown code is run when there is a non-fatal error at
init-time, so that stale data isn't present when the user fixes the
cause of the soft error.
