HID: make parser more verbose about parsing errors by default

Most of the parsing errors (typically resulting in device not being claimed
by HID subsystem at all) are reported only in debugging mode, which makes
root-causing problems with buggy devices unnecessarily more difficult.

Convert reporting of important HID report descriptor parsing errors to
be reported through hid_err() / hid_warn() instead of dbg_hid().
