block, cfq: move io_cq lookup to blk-ioc.c

Now that all io_cq related data structures are in block core layer,
io_cq lookup can be moved from cfq-iosched.c to blk-ioc.c.

Lookup logic from cfq_cic_lookup() is moved to ioc_lookup_icq() with
parameter return type changes (cfqd -> request_queue, cfq_io_cq ->
io_cq) and cfq_cic_lookup() becomes thin wrapper around
cfq_cic_lookup().
