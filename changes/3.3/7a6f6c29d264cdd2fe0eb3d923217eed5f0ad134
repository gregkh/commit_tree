[media] cx231xx: use URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP on URBs allocated with usb_alloc_urb()

URBs allocated with usb_alloc_urb() are allocated from DMA-coherent
areas, and therefore it is not necessary to call dma_map_single() on
such buffers. Worst, on ARM, calling dma_map_single() on a
DMA-coherent buffer will trigger a BUG_ON() in
arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c.

Therefore, we mark all URBs allocated with usb_alloc_urb() with the
URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP transfer_flags, so that the USB core does not
do dma_map_single()/dma_unmap_single() on those buffers.

This is similar to 882787ff8fdeb0be790547ee9b22b281095e95da for the
gspca driver, and has already been discussed on the linux-media list
in the past:
