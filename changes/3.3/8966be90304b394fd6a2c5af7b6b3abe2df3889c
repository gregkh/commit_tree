vfs: trivial __d_lookup_rcu() cleanups

These don't change any semantics, but they clean up the code a bit and
mark some arguments appropriately 'const'.

They came up as I was doing the word-at-a-time dcache name accessor
code, and cleaning this up now allows me to send out a smaller relevant
interesting patch for the experimental stuff.
