qla3xxx: ethernet: Fix bogus interrupt state flag.

In 'ql_adapter_initialize'
the first call for 'spin_unlock_irqrestore()' is with hw_flags = 0,
which is as good as 'spin_unlock_irq()' (unconditional interrupt
enabling). If this is intended, then for better performance
'spin_unlock_irqrestore()' can be replaced with 'spin_unlock_irq()'
and 'spin_lock_irqsave()' can be replaced by 'spin_lock_irq()
