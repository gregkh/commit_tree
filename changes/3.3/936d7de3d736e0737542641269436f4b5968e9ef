IPoIB: Stop lying about hard_header_len and use skb->cb to stash LL addresses

Commit a0417fa3a18a ("net: Make qdisc_skb_cb upper size bound
explicit.") made it possible for a netdev driver to use skb->cb
between its header_ops.create method and its .ndo_start_xmit
method.  Use this in ipoib_hard_header() to stash away the LL address
(GID + QPN), instead of the "ipoib_pseudoheader" hack.  This allows
IPoIB to stop lying about its hard_header_len, which will let us fix
the L2 check for GRO.
