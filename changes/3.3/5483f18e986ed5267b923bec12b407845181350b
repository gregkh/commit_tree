vfs: move dentry_cmp from <linux/dcache.h> to fs/dcache.c

It's only used inside fs/dcache.c, and we're going to play games with it
for the word-at-a-time patches.  This time we really don't even want to
export it, because it really is an internal function to fs/dcache.c, and
has been since it was introduced.

Having it in that extremely hot header file (it's included in pretty
much everything, thanks to <linux/fs.h>) is a disaster for testing
different versions, and is utterly pointless.

We really should have some kind of header file diet thing, where we
figure out which parts of header files are really better off private and
only result in more expensive compiles.
