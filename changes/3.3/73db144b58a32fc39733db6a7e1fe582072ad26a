Xen: consolidate and simplify struct xenbus_driver instantiation

The 'name', 'owner', and 'mod_name' members are redundant with the
identically named fields in the 'driver' sub-structure. Rather than
switching each instance to specify these fields explicitly, introduce
a macro to simplify this.

Eliminate further redundancy by allowing the drvname argument to
DEFINE_XENBUS_DRIVER() to be blank (in which case the first entry from
the ID table will be used for .driver.name).

Also eliminate the questionable xenbus_register_{back,front}end()
wrappers - their sole remaining purpose was the checking of the
'owner' field, proper setting of which shouldn't be an issue anymore
when the macro gets used.

v2: Restore DRV_NAME for the driver name in xen-pciback.
