[media] v4l2-ctrls: make control names consistent

Several control names used inconsistent capitalization or were inconsistent
in other ways. I also corrected a spelling mistake and fixed four strings
that were too long (>31 characters). Harmless, but the string is cut off when
it is returned with QUERYCTRL.
