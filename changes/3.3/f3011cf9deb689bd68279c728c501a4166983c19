mac80211: Avoid filling up mesh preq queue with redundant requests

Don't accept redundant PREQs for a given destination. This fixes a
problem under high load:

kernel: [20386.250913] mesh_queue_preq: 235 callbacks suppressed
kernel: [20386.253335] Mesh HWMP (mesh0): PREQ node queue full
kernel: [20386.253352] Mesh HWMP (mesh0): PREQ node queue full
(...)

The 802.11s protocol has a provision to limit the rate of path requests
(PREQs) are transmitted (dot11MeshHWMPpreqMinInterval) but there was no
limit on the rate at which PREQs were being queued up.  There is a valid
reason for queuing PREQs: this way we can even out PREQ bursts.  But
queueing multiple PREQs for the same destination is useless.
