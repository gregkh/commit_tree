jump_label: jump_label_inc may return before the code is patched

If cpu A calls jump_label_inc() just after atomic_add_return() is
called by cpu B, atomic_inc_not_zero() will return value greater then
zero and jump_label_inc() will return to a caller before jump_label_update()
finishes its job on cpu B.
