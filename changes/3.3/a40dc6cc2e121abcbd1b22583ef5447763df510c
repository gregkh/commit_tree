ceph: enable/disable dentry complete flags via mount option

Enable/disable use of the dentry dir 'complete' flag via a mount option.
This lets the admin control whether ceph uses the dcache to satisfy
negative lookups or readdir when it has the entire directory contents in
its cache.

This is purely a performance optimization; correctness is guaranteed
whether it is enabled or not.
