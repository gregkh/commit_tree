powerpc/powernv: Fix problems in onlining CPUs

At present, on the powernv platform, if you off-line a CPU that was
online, and then try to on-line it again, the kernel generates a
warning message "OPAL Error -1 starting CPU n".  Furthermore, if the
CPU is a secondary thread that was used by KVM while it was off-line,
the CPU fails to come online.

The first problem is fixed by only calling OPAL to start the CPU the
first time it is on-lined, as indicated by the cpu_start field of its
PACA being zero.  The second problem is fixed by restoring the
cpu_start field to 1 instead of 0 when using the CPU within KVM.
