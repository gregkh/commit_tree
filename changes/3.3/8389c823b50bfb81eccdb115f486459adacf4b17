powerpc/85xx: Rework P3060QDS device tree

Utilize new split between board & SoC, and new SoC device trees split
into pre & post utilizing 'template' includes for SoC IP blocks.

Other changes include:
* Adding of MPIC timer blocks
* Dropping "fsl,p3060-IP..." from compatibles for standard blocks
* Removed mpic interrupt-parent from dcsr-epu node, just use top level
* Removed mpic interrupt-parent from sec nodes, just use top level
* Fixed l3-cache IRQs, we have 2 CPCs, so we should have IRQs for both
