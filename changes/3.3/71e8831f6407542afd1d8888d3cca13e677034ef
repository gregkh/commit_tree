drm/omap: DMM/TILER support for OMAP4+ platform

Dynamic Memory Manager (DMM) is a hardware block in the OMAP4+
processor that contains at least one TILER instance.  TILER, or
Tiling and Isometric Lightweight Engine for Rotation, provides
IOMMU capabilities through the use of a physical address translation
table.  The TILER also provides zero cost rotation and mirroring.

The TILER provides both 1D and 2D access by providing different views
or address ranges that can be used to access the physical memory that
has been mapped in through the PAT.  Access to the 1D view results in
linear access to the underlying memory.  Access to the 2D views result
in tiled access to the underlying memory resulted in increased
efficiency.

The TILER address space is managed by a tiler container manager (TCM)
and allocates the address space through the use of the Simple Tiler
Allocation algorithm (SiTA).  The purpose of the algorithm is to keep
fragmentation of the address space as low as possible.
