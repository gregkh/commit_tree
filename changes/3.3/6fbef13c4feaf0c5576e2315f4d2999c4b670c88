powerpc: Cleanup memblock usage

* early_init_devtree(): Total memory size is aligned to PAGE_SIZE;
  however, alignment isn't enforced if memory_limit is explicitly
  specified.  Simplify the logic and always apply PAGE_SIZE alignment.

* MMU_init(): memblock regions is truncated by directly modifying
  memblock.memory.cnt.  This is incomplete (reserved array is not
  truncated) and unnecessarily low level hindering further memblock
  improvments.  Use memblock_enforce_memory_limit() instead.

* wii_memory_fixups(): Unnecessarily low level direct manipulation of
  memblock regions.  The same result can be achieved using properly
  abstracted operations.  Reimplement using memblock API.
