[media] gspca - main: isoc mode devices are never low speed

Quoting from the official usb 20 spec:
"5.6.4 Isochronous Transfer Bus Access Constraints

Isochronous transfers can only be used by full-speed and high-speed devices."

This means that for code paths which are isoc mode only, we don't need to
check for the device being low speed, simplifying the code.
