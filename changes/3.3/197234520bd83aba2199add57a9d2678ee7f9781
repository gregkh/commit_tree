tty: serial: omap-serial: wakeup latency constraint is in microseconds, not milliseconds

The receive FIFO wakeup latency estimate in the omap-serial driver is
three orders of magnitude too small.  This effectively prevents the
MPU from going to a low-power state when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y.  This is a
major power management regression and masks some other FIFO-related
bugs in the driver.

Fix by correcting the most egregious problem in the RX wakeup latency
estimate.  There are several other flaws in the estimator; these will
be fixed by a separate patch series intended for 3.4.

The difference in low-power states with this patch can be observed via
debugfs in pm_debug/count.

This estimate does not have any effect when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=n.
