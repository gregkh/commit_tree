netfilter: use jump_label for nf_hooks

On configs where CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL=y, we can replace in fast path a
load/compare/conditional jump by a single jump with no dcache reference.

Jump target is modified as soon as nf_hooks[pf][hook] switches from
empty state to non empty states. jump_label state is kept outside of
nf_hooks array so has no cost on cpu caches.

This patch removes the test on CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG : No need to call
nf_hook_slow() at all if nf_hooks[pf][hook] is empty, this didnt give
useful information, but slowed down things a lot.
