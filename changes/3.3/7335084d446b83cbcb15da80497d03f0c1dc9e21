mm: vmscan: do not OOM if aborting reclaim to start compaction

During direct reclaim it is possible that reclaim will be aborted so that
compaction can be attempted to satisfy a high-order allocation.  If this
decision is made before any pages are reclaimed, it is possible that 0 is
returned to the page allocator potentially triggering an OOM.  This has
not been observed but it is a possibility so this patch addresses it.
