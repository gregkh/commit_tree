x86/PCI: use host bridge _CRS info on MSI MS-7253

In the spirit of commit 29cf7a30f8a0 ("x86/PCI: use host bridge _CRS
info on ASUS M2V-MX SE"), this DMI quirk turns on "pci_use_crs" by
default on a board that needs it.

This fixes boot failures and oopses introduced in 3e3da00c01d0
("x86/pci: AMD one chain system to use pci read out res").  The quirk
is quite targetted (to a specific board and BIOS version) for two
reasons:

 (1) to emphasize that this method of tackling the problem one quirk
     at a time is a little insane

 (2) to give BIOS vendors an opportunity to use simpler tables and
     allow us to return to generic behavior (whatever that happens to
     be) with a later BIOS update

In other words, I am not at all happy with having quirks like this.
But it is even worse for the kernel not to work out of the box on
these machines, so...
