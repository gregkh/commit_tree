MIPS: Alchemy: Increase minimum timeout for 32kHz timer.

Since a clocksource change post 3.2-rc1, tasks on my DB1500 board
hang after random amounts of time (from a few minutes to a few hours),
regardless of load.  Debugging showed that the compare-match register
value is a few seconds lower than the current counter value.

The minimum value of 8 was initialy determined by a trial-and-error
approach.  Currently it is sufficient for all Alchemys (without PCI
apparently), independent of CPU clock;  only the DB1500 and DB1550
boards experience these timer-related tasks hangs now.

This patch increases the minimum timeout by 1 (to 9 counter ticks)
which seems sufficient since the systems are still working perfectly
fine after over 24 hours.
