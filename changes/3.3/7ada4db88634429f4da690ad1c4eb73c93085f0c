vfs: count unlinked inodes

Add a new counter to the superblock that keeps track of unlinked but
not yet deleted inodes.

Do not WARN_ON if set_nlink is called with zero count, just do a
ratelimited printk.  This happens on xfs and probably other
filesystems after an unclean shutdown when the filesystem reads inodes
which already have zero i_nlink.  Reported by Christoph Hellwig.
