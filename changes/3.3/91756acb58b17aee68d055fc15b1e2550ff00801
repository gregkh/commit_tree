ARM: 7303/1: perf: add empty NODE event definitions for Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A15

Commit 89d6c0b5 ("perf, arch: Add generic NODE cache events") added
empty NODE event definitions for the ARM PMU implementations. This was
merged along with Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A15 PMU support, so they missed
out on the original patch.

This patch adds the empty definitions to Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A15.
