powerpc: hugetlb: fix huge_ptep_set_access_flags return value

There was an unconditional return of "1" in the original code
from David Gibson, and I dropped it because it wasn't needed
for FSL BOOKE 32-bit.  However, not all systems (including 64-bit
FSL BOOKE) do loading of the hpte from the fault handler asm
and depend on this function returning 1, which causes a call
to update_mmu_cache() that writes an entry into the tlb.
