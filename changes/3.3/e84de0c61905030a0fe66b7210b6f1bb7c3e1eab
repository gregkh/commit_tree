MIPS: GIO bus support for SGI IP22/28

SGI IP22/IP28 machines have GIO busses for adding graphics and other
extension cards. This patch adds support for GIO driver/device
handling and converts the newport console driver to a GIO driver.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Fixed build error caused by the modules.h -> export.h
changes.]
