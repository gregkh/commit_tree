usb: dwc3: ep0: SetAddress() won't be issued while Configured

I have talked to USB-IF about USB30CV issuing SetAddres()
with a device on Configured state and they have agreed on
changing USB30CV not to do so.

Adding back the STALL reply in such case and while at
that, also add a debugging message for an address which
is too large.
