ARM: 7356/1: perf: check that we have an event in the PMU IRQ handlers

The PMU IRQ handlers in perf assume that if a counter has overflowed
then perf must be responsible. In the paranoid world of crazy hardware,
this could be false, so check that we do have a valid event before
attempting to dereference NULL in the interrupt path.
