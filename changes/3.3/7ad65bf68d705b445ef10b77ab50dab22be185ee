caif: Add support for CAIF over CDC NCM USB interface

NCM 1.0 does not support anything but Ethernet framing, hence
CAIF payload will be put into Ethernet frames.

Discovery is based on fixed USB vendor 0x04cc (ST-Ericsson),
product-id 0x230f (NCM). In this variant only CAIF payload is sent over
the NCM interface.

The CAIF stack (cfusbl.c) will when USB interface register first check if
we got a CDC NCM USB interface with the right VID, PID.
It will then read the device's Ethernet address and create a 'template'
Ethernet TX header, using a broadcast address as the destination address,
and EthType 0x88b5 (802.1 Local Experimental - vendor specific).

A protocol handler for 0x88b5 is setup for reception of CAIF frames from
the CDC NCM USB interface.
