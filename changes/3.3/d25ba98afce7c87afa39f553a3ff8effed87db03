m68k: remove thread_info struct from thread struct

Currently on m68k we have a comeplete thread_info structure stored inside
of the thread_struct, and we also have it in the initial part of the kernel
stack. Mostly the code currently uses the one inside of the thread_struct,
only using the "task" pointer from the stack based one.

This is wasteful and confusing, we should only have the single instance of
thread_info inside the stack page. And this is the norm for all other
architectures.

This change makes m68k handle thread_info consistently on both MMU enabled
and non-MMU setups.
