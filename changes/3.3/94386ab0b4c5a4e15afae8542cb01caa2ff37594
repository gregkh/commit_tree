staging:iio: Remove redundant spi driver bus initialization

In ancient times it was necessary to manually initialize the bus field of an
spi_driver to spi_bus_type. These days this is done in spi_register_driver() so
we can drop the manual assignment.

The patch was generated using the following coccinelle semantic patch:
// <smpl>
@@
identifier _driver;
@@
 struct spi_driver _driver = {
 	.driver = {
-		.bus = &spi_bus_type,
 	},
 };
// </smpl>
