mm: vmscan: check if reclaim should really abort even if compaction_ready() is true for one zone

If compaction can proceed for a given zone, shrink_zones() does not
reclaim any more pages from it.  After commit [e0c2327: vmscan: abort
reclaim/compaction if compaction can proceed], do_try_to_free_pages()
tries to finish as soon as possible once one zone can compact.

This was intended to prevent slabs being shrunk unnecessarily but there
are side-effects.  One is that a small zone that is ready for compaction
will abort reclaim even if the chances of successfully allocating a THP
from that zone is small.  It also means that reclaim can return too early
even though sc->nr_to_reclaim pages were not reclaimed.

This partially reverts the commit until it is proven that slabs are really
being shrunk unnecessarily but preserves the check to return 1 to avoid
OOM if reclaim was aborted prematurely.
