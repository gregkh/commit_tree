drm/i915: kicking rings stuck on semaphores considered harmful

If our semaphore logic gets confused and we have a ring stuck waiting
for one, there's a decent chance it'll just execute garbage when being
kicked. Also, kicking the ring obscures the place where the error
first occured, making error_state decoding much harder.

So drop this an let gpu reset handle this mess in a clean fashion.

In contrast, kicking rings stuck on MI_WAIT is rather harmless, at
worst there'll be a bit of screen-flickering. There's also old
broken userspace out there which needs this as a  work-around.
