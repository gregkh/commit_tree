powerpc: Fix various issues with return to userspace

We have a few problems when returning to userspace. This is a
quick set of fixes for 3.3, I'll look into a more comprehensive
rework for 3.4. This fixes:

 - We kept interrupts soft-disabled when schedule'ing or calling
do_signal when returning to userspace as a result of a hardware
interrupt.

 - Rename do_signal to do_notify_resume like all other archs (and
do_signal_pending back to do_signal, which it was before Roland
changed it).

 - Add the missing call to key_replace_session_keyring() to
do_notify_resume().
