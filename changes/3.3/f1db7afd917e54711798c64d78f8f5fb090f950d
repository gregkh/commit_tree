mm/vmalloc.c: eliminate extra loop in pcpu_get_vm_areas error path

If either of the vas or vms arrays are not properly kzalloced, then the
code jumps to the err_free label.

The err_free label runs a loop to check and free each of the array members
of the vas and vms arrays which is not required for this situation as none
of the array members have been allocated till this point.

Eliminate the extra loop we have to go through by introducing a new label
err_free2 and then jumping to it.
