tipc: Do timely cleanup of disabled Ethernet bearer resources

Modifies Ethernet bearer disable logic to break the association between
the bearer and its device driver at the time the bearer is disabled,
rather than when the TIPC module is unloaded. This allows the array
entry used by the disabled bearer to be re-used if the same bearer (or
a different one) is subsequently enabled.
