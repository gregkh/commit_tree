hwmon: (sysfs-interface) Update tempX_type attribute to be more generic

The temp[1-*]_type attribute reports the temperature sensor type. Sensor type 1
is described as "PII/Celeron Diode", which is quite restrictive; other CPUs
may also have an embedded temperature sensor diode with similar characteristics.
Change description to "CPU embedded diode" to be more generic.
