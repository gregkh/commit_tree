alpha: fix 32/64-bit bug in futex support

Michael Cree said:

: : I have noticed some user space problems (pulseaudio crashes in pthread

: : Bisecting between 2.6.38 and 2.6.39 (using glibc/nptl test suite as
: : criterion for good/bad kernel) eventually leads to:

: :     futex: Sanitize futex ops argument types
: :
: :     Change futex_atomic_op_inuser and futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic
: :     prototypes to use u32 types for the futex as this is the data type the
: :     futex core code uses all over the place.

: : Looking at the commit I see there is a change of the uaddr argument in
: : the Alpha architecture specific code for futexes from int to u32, but I
: : don't see why this should cause a problem.

: futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(u32 *uval, u32 __user *uaddr,

:         :       "r"(uaddr), "r"((long)oldval), "r"(newval)

: There is no 32-bit compare instruction.  These are implemented by
: consistently extending the values to a 64-bit type.  Since the
: load instruction sign-extends, we want to sign-extend the other
: quantity as well (despite the fact it's logically unsigned).
:
: So:
:
: -        :       "r"(uaddr), "r"((long)oldval), "r"(newval)
: +        :       "r"(uaddr), "r"((long)(int)oldval), "r"(newval)
:
: should do the trick.

: This fixes the glibc test suite failures and the pulseaudio related
: crashes, but it does not fix the java compiiler lockups that I was (and
: are still) observing.  That is some other problem.
