ext4: use proper little-endian bitops

ext4_{set,clear}_bit() is defined as __test_and_{set,clear}_bit_le() for
ext4.  Only two ext4_{set,clear}_bit() calls check the return value.  The
rest of calls ignore the return value and they can be replaced with
__{set,clear}_bit_le().

This changes ext4_{set,clear}_bit() from __test_and_{set,clear}_bit_le()
to __{set,clear}_bit_le() and introduces ext4_test_and_{set,clear}_bit()
for the two places where old bit needs to be returned.

This ext4_{set,clear}_bit() change is considered safe, because if someone
uses these macros without noticing the change, new ext4_{set,clear}_bit
don't have return value and causes compiler errors where the return value
is used.

This also removes unused ext4_find_first_zero_bit().
