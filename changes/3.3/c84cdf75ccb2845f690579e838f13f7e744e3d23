cgroup: Remove unnecessary task_lock before fetching css_set on migration

When we fetch the css_set of the tasks on cgroup migration, we don't need
anymore to synchronize against cgroup_exit() that could swap the old one
with init_css_set. Now that we are using threadgroup_lock() during
the migrations, we don't need to worry about it anymore.
