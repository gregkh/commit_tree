ALSA: hda - Fix silent speaker output on Acer Aspire 6935

Since 3.2 kernel, the driver starts trying to assign the multi-io DACs
before the speaker, thus it assigns DAC2/3 for multi-io and DAC4 for
the speaker for a standard laptop setup like a HP, a speaker, a mic-in
and a line-in.  However, on Acer Aspire 6935, it seems that the
speaker pin 0x14 must be connected with either DAC1 or 2; otherwise it
results in silence by some reason, although the codec itself allows
the routing to DAC3/4.

As a workaround, the connection list of each pin is reduced to be
mapped to either only DAC1/2 or DAC3/4, so that the compatible
assignment as in kernel 3.1 is achieved.
