mac80211: Fix a warning on changing to monitor mode from STA

nothing needs to be done for monitor/AP_VLAN mode on calling
ieee80211_bss_info_change_notify -> drv_bss_info_changed with the change
flag 'BSS_CHANGED_IDLE'. 'wl1271' seems to use BSS_CHANGED_IDLE only for
STA and IBSS mode. further the non-idle state of the monitor mode is
taken care by the 'count' variable which counts non-idle interfaces.
ieee80211_idle_off(local, "in use") will be called.
this fixes the following WARNING when we have initially STA mode
(network manager running) and not associated, and change it to monitor
mode with network manager disabled and bringing up the monitor mode.
this changes the idle state from 'true' (STA unassociated) to 'false'
(MONITOR mode)
