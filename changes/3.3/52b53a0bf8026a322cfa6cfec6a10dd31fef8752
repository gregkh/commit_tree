drm/radeon/kms/blit: fix blit copy for very large buffers

Evergreen and NI blit copy was broken if the buffer maps to a rectangle
whose one dimension is 16384 (max dimension allowed by these chips).
In the mainline kernel, the problem is exposed only when buffers are
very large (1G), but it's still a problem. The problem could be exposed
for smaller buffers if anyone modifies the algorithm for rectangle
construction in r600_blit_create_rect() (the reason why someone would
modify that algorithm is to tune the performance of buffer moves).

The root cause was in i2f() function which only operated on range between
0 and 16383. Fix this by extending the range of i2f() function to 0 to
32767.

While at it improve the function so that the range can be easily
extended in the future (if it becomes necessary), cleanup lines
over 80 characters, and replace in-line comments with one strategic
comment that explains the crux of the function.

Credits to michel@daenzer.net for pointing out the root cause of
the bug.

v2: Fix I2F_MAX_INPUT constant definition goof and warn only once
    if input argument is out of range. Edit the comment a little
    bit to avoid some linguistic confusion and make it look better
    in general.
