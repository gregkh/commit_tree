mac80211: count authorized stations per BSS

Currently, each AP interface will send multicast
traffic if any interface has a station entry even
if that station entry is allocated only. With the
new station state management we can easily fix it
by adding a counter that counts each authorized
station only and send multicast traffic only when
the correct interface has at least one authorized
station.
