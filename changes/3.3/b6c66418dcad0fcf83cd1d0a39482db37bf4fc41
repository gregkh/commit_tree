i387: move TS_USEDFPU clearing out of __save_init_fpu and into callers

Touching TS_USEDFPU without touching CR0.TS is confusing, so don't do
it.  By moving it into the callers, we always do the TS_USEDFPU next to
the CR0.TS accesses in the source code, and it's much easier to see how
the two go hand in hand.
