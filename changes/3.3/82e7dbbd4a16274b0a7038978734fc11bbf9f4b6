[media] em28xx: initial support for HAUPPAUGE HVR-930C again

With this patch I try again to add initial support for HVR930C.

Tested only DVB-T, since in Italy Analog service is stopped.

Actually "scan -a0 -f1", find only about 50 channel while 400 should
be available.

[mchehab@redhat.com: Tested with DVB-C and fixed a few whitespace issues]
