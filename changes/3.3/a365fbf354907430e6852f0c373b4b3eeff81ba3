GFS2: Read resource groups on mount

This makes mount take slightly longer, but at the same time, the first
write to the filesystem will be faster too. It also means that if there
is a problem in the resource index, then we can refuse to mount rather
than having to try and report that when the first write occurs.

In addition, to avoid recursive locking, we hvae to take account of
instances when the rindex glock may already be held when we are
trying to update the rbtree of resource groups.
