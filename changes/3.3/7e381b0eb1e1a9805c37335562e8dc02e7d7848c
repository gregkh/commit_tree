cgroup: Drop task_lock(parent) on cgroup_fork()

We don't need to hold the parent task_lock() on the
parent in cgroup_fork() because we are already synchronized
against the two places that may change the parent css_set
concurrently:

- cgroup_exit(), but the parent obviously can't exit concurrently
- cgroup migration: we are synchronized against threadgroup_lock()

So we can safely remove the task_lock() there.
