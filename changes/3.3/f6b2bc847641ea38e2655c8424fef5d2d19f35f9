x86-64: Cleanup some assembly entry points

system_call_after_swapgs doesn't really benefit from forcing
alignment from it - quite the opposite, native code needlessly
so far got a big NOP instruction inserted in front of it. Xen
being the only user of the separate entry point can well live
with the branch going to three bytes into a cache line.

The compatibility mode ptregs entry points for one can make use
of the GLOBAL() macro, and should be suitably aligned. Their
shared continuation point (ia32_ptregs_common) otoh doesn't need
to be global at all, but should continue to be properly aligned.
