rcu: Fix idle-task checks

RCU has traditionally relied on idle_cpu() to determine whether a given
CPU is running in the context of an idle task, but commit 908a3283
(Fix idle_cpu()) has invalidated this approach.  After commit 908a3283,
idle_cpu() will return true if the current CPU is currently running the
idle task, and will be doing so for the foreseeable future.  RCU instead
needs to know whether or not the current CPU is currently running the
idle task, regardless of what the near future might bring.

This commit therefore switches from idle_cpu() to "current->pid != 0".
