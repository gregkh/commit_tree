igb: fix vf lookup

Recent addition of code to find already allocated VFs failed to take
account that systems with 2 or more multi-port SR-IOV capable controllers
might have already enabled VFs.  Make sure that the VFs the function is
finding are actually subordinate to the particular instance of the adapter
that is looking for them and not subordinate to some device that has
previously enabled SR-IOV.

This is applicable to 3.2+ kernels.
