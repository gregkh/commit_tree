crypto: GnuPG based MPI lib - header files (part 2)

Adds the multi-precision-integer maths library which was originally taken
from GnuPG and ported to the kernel by (among others) David Howells.
This version is taken from Fedora kernel 2.6.32-71.14.1.el6.
The difference is that checkpatch reported errors and warnings have been fixed.

This library is used to implemenet RSA digital signature verification
used in IMA/EVM integrity protection subsystem.

Due to patch size limitation, the patch is divided into 4 parts.
