Btrfs: soft profile changing mode (aka soft convert)

When doing convert from one profile to another if soft mode is on
restriper won't touch chunks that already have the profile we are
converting to.  This is useful if e.g. half of the FS was converted
earlier.

The soft mode switch is (like every other filter) per-type.  This means
that we can convert for example meta chunks the "hard" way while
converting data chunks selectively with soft switch.
