ARM: 7193/1: Fix machine_is_xxx() naming for eSata SheevaPlug and QNAP TS-209

The eSata SheevaPlug and QNAP TS-209 devices were removed from
mach-types due to naming mismatches between machine_is_xxx(), CONFIG_XXX
and MACH_TYPE_XXX.

This patch fixes those mismatches and adds the devices back into
mach-types.
