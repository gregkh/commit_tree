vfs: clarify and clean up dentry_cmp()

It did some odd things for unclear reasons.  As this is one of the
functions that gets changed when doing word-at-a-time compares, this is
yet another of the "don't change any semantics, but clean things up so
that subsequent patches don't get obscured by the cleanups".
