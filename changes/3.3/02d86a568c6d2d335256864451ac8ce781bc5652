audit: allow interfield comparison in audit rules

We wish to be able to audit when a uid=500 task accesses a file which is
uid=0.  Or vice versa.  This patch introduces a new audit filter type
AUDIT_FIELD_COMPARE which takes as an 'enum' which indicates which fields
should be compared.  At this point we only define the task->uid vs
inode->uid, but other comparisons can be added.
