xen-blkback: convert hole punching to discard request on loop devices

As of dfaa2ef68e80c378e610e3c8c536f1c239e8d3ef, loop devices support
discard request now. We could just issue a discard request, and
the loop driver will punch the hole for us, so we don't need to touch
the internals of loop device and punch the hole ourselves, Thanks.

V0->V1: rebased on devel/for-jens-3.3
