C6X: early boot code

Original port to early 2.6 kernel using TI COFF toolchain.
Brought up to date by Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com>

This patch provides the early boot code for C6X architecture. There is a
16 entry vector table which is used to direct reset and interrupt events. The
vector table entries contain a small amount of code (maximum of 8 opcodes)
which simply branches to the actual event handling code.

The head.S code simply clears BSS, setups up a few control registers, and calls
machine_init followed by start_kernel. The machine_init code in setup.c does
the early flat tree parsing (memory, commandline, etc). At setup_arch time, the
code does the usual memory setup and minimally scans the devicetree for any
needed information.
