iwlagn: remove calibration knowledge

The init microcode knows very well which calibrations
are required and sends us results for those that are.
Consequently, we can just send all of those to the RT
uCode again.

The problem with having the driver know about this is
that it is a uCode feature, not a hardware feature so
the config is completely unsuitable.

The only thing we need to check is whether the device
needs crystal calibration or not, add a new parameter
to the configuration for that.

This makes new uCode work on 6000 series devices.
