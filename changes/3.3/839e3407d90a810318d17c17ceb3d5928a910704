freezer: remove unused @sig_only from freeze_task()

After "freezer: make freezing() test freeze conditions in effect
instead of TIF_FREEZE", freezing() returns authoritative answer on
whether the current task should freeze or not and freeze_task()
doesn't need or use @sig_only.  Remove it.

While at it, rewrite function comment for freeze_task() and rename
@sig_only to @user_only in try_to_freeze_tasks().

This patch doesn't cause any functional change.
