procfs: introduce the /proc/<pid>/map_files/ directory

This one behaves similarly to the /proc/<pid>/fd/ one - it contains
symlinks one for each mapping with file, the name of a symlink is
"vma->vm_start-vma->vm_end", the target is the file.  Opening a symlink
results in a file that point exactly to the same inode as them vma's one.

For example the ls -l of some arbitrary /proc/<pid>/map_files/

 | lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Aug 26 06:40 7f8f80403000-7f8f80404000 -> /lib64/libc-2.5.so
 | lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Aug 26 06:40 7f8f8061e000-7f8f80620000 -> /lib64/libselinux.so.1
 | lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Aug 26 06:40 7f8f80826000-7f8f80827000 -> /lib64/libacl.so.1.1.0
 | lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Aug 26 06:40 7f8f80a2f000-7f8f80a30000 -> /lib64/librt-2.5.so
 | lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Aug 26 06:40 7f8f80a30000-7f8f80a4c000 -> /lib64/ld-2.5.so

This *helps* checkpointing process in three ways:

1. When dumping a task mappings we do know exact file that is mapped
   by particular region.  We do this by opening
   /proc/$pid/map_files/$address symlink the way we do with file
   descriptors.

2. This also helps in determining which anonymous shared mappings are
   shared with each other by comparing the inodes of them.

3. When restoring a set of processes in case two of them has a mapping
   shared, we map the memory by the 1st one and then open its
   /proc/$pid/map_files/$address file and map it by the 2nd task.

Using /proc/$pid/maps for this is quite inconvenient since it brings
repeatable re-reading and reparsing for this text file which slows down
restore procedure significantly.  Also as being pointed in (3) it is a way
easier to use top level shared mapping in children as
/proc/$pid/map_files/$address when needed.
