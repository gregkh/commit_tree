dlm: add recovery callbacks

These new callbacks notify the dlm user about lock recovery.
GFS2, and possibly others, need to be aware of when the dlm
will be doing lock recovery for a failed lockspace member.

In the past, this coordination has been done between dlm and
file system daemons in userspace, which then direct their
kernel counterparts.  These callbacks allow the same
coordination directly, and more simply.
