memblock: Reimplement memblock_add_region()

memblock_add_region() carefully checked for merge and overlap
conditions while adding a new region, which is complicated and makes
it difficult to allow arbitrary overlaps or add more merge conditions
(e.g. node ID).

This re-implements memblock_add_region() such that insertion is done
in two steps - all non-overlapping portions of new area are inserted
as separate regions first and then memblock_merge_regions() scan and
merge all neighbouring compatible regions.

This makes addition logic simpler and more versatile and enables
adding node information to memblock.
