tcm_fc: Convert ft_send_work to use target_submit_cmd

This patch converts the main ft_send_work() I/O path to use
target_submit_cmd() with a single se_cmd->cmd_kref reference
that is released via the existing ft_check_stop_free() response
path callback.

It also makes ft_send_tm() use transport_init_se_cmd() and
target_get_sess_cmd() to also use single se_cmd->cmd_kref
reference.
