mm: add vm_area_add_early()

The existing vm_area_register_early() allows for early vmalloc space
allocation.  However upcoming cleanups in the ARM architecture require
that some fixed locations in the vmalloc area be reserved also very early.

The name "vm_area_register_early" would have been a good name for the
reservation part without the allocation.  Since it is already in use with
different semantics, let's create vm_area_add_early() instead.

Both vm_area_register_early() and vm_area_add_early() can be used together
meaning that the former is now implemented using the later where it is
ensured that no conflicting areas are added, but no attempt is made to
make the allocation scheme in vm_area_register_early() more sophisticated.
After all, you must know what you're doing when using those functions.
