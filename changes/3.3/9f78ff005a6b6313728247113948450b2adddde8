debugobjects: Fix selftest for static warnings

debugobjects is now printing a warning when a fixup for a NOTAVAILABLE
object is run.  This causes the selftest to fail like:

	ODEBUG: selftest warnings failed 4 != 5

We could just increase the number of warnings that the selftest is
expecting to see because that is actually what has changed.  But, it turns
out that fixup_activate() was written with inverted logic and thus a fixup
for a static object returned 1 indicating the object had been fixed, and 0
otherwise.  Fix the logic to be correct and update the counts to reflect
that nothing needed fixing for a static object.
