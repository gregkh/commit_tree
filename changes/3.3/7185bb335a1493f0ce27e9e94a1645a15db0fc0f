bnx2x: properly initialize L5 features

The code is missing initialization of NO_FCOE_FLAG and NO_ISCSI*FLAGS
when CONFIG_CNIC is not selected.
This causes panic during driver load since commit
1d187b34daaecbb87aa523ba46b92930a388cb21 where NO_FCOE tested
unconditionally (outside #ifdef BCM_CNIC  structure) and
accessed fp[FCOE_IDX] which is not allocated.
