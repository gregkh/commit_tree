rds: Make rds_sock_lock BH rather than IRQ safe.

rds_sock_info() triggers locking warnings because we try to perform a
local_bh_enable() (via sock_i_ino()) while hardware interrupts are
disabled (via taking rds_sock_lock).

There is no reason for rds_sock_lock to be a hardware IRQ disabling
lock, none of these access paths run in hardware interrupt context.

Therefore making it a BH disabling lock is safe and sufficient to
fix this bug.
