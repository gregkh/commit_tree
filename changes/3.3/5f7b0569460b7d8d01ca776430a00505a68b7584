unix_diag: Unix inode info NLA

Actually, the socket path if it's not anonymous doesn't give
a clue to which file the socket is bound to. Even if the path
is absolute, it can be unlinked and then new socket can be
bound to it.

With this NLA it's possible to check which file a particular
socket is really bound to.
