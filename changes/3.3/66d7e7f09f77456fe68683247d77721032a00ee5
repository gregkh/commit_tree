Btrfs: mark delayed refs as for cow

Add a for_cow parameter to add_delayed_*_ref and pass the appropriate value
from every call site. The for_cow parameter will later on be used to
determine if a ref will change anything with respect to qgroups.

Delayed refs coming from relocation are always counted as for_cow, as they
don't change subvol quota.

Also pass in the fs_info for later use.

btrfs_find_all_roots() will use this as an optimization, as changes that are
for_cow will not change anything with respect to which root points to a
certain leaf. Thus, we don't need to add the current sequence number to
those delayed refs.
