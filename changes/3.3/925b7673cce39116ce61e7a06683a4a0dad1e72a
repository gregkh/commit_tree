mm: make per-memcg LRU lists exclusive

Now that all code that operated on global per-zone LRU lists is
converted to operate on per-memory cgroup LRU lists instead, there is no
reason to keep the double-LRU scheme around any longer.

The pc->lru member is removed and page->lru is linked directly to the
per-memory cgroup LRU lists, which removes two pointers from a
descriptor that exists for every page frame in the system.
