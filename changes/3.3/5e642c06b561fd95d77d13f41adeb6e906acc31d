[media] it9135:  add support for IT9135 9005 devices

Support add for IT9135 9005 devices

With this patch IT9135 devices now move to using
dvb-usb-it9135-01.fw firmware
IT9137 remain on previous firmware.

IT9135 devices seem more stable on this firmware.

If the user wishes to remain on it9137 firmware they can change
back using firmware=1 module option.
