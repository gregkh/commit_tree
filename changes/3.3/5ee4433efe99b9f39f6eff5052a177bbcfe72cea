netns: Fail conspicously if someone uses net_generic at an inappropriate time.

By definition net_generic should never be called when it can return
NULL.  Fail conspicously with a BUG_ON to make it clear when people mess
up that a NULL return should never happen.

Recently there was a bug in the CAIF subsystem where it was registered
with register_pernet_device instead of register_pernet_subsys.  It was
erroneously concluded that net_generic could validly return NULL and
that net_assign_generic was buggy (when it was just inefficient).
Hopefully this BUG_ON will prevent people to coming to similar erroneous
conclusions in the futrue.
