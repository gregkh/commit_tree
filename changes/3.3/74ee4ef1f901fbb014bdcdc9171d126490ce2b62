slub: disallow changing cpu_partial from userspace for debug caches

For caches with debugging enabled, "slub: Switch per cpu partial page
support off for debugging" changes cpu_partial to 0.  It shouldn't be
tunable from userspace for such caches, otherwise the same accounting
issues arise during validation.

This patch disallows tuning /sys/kernel/slab/cache/cpu_partial to be non-
zero for caches with debugging enabled.
