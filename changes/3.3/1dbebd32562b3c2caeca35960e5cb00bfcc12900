mtd: harmonize mtd_writev usage

This patch makes the 'mtd_writev()' function more usable and logical. We first
teach it to fall-back to the 'default_mtd_writev()' function if the MTD driver
does not define its own '->writev()' method. Then we make block2mtd and JFFS2
just 'mtd_writev()' instead of 'default_mtd_writev()' function. This means we
can now stop exporting 'default_mtd_writev()' and instead, export
'mtd_writev()'. This is much cleaner and more logical, as well as allows us to
get read of another direct 'mtd->writev' access in JFFS2.
