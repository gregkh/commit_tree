ACPI, APEI, GHES, Distinguish interleaved error report in kernel log

In most cases, printk only guarantees messages from different printk
calling will not be interleaved between each other.  But, one APEI
GHES hardware error report will involve multiple printk calling,
normally each for one line.  So it is possible that the hardware error
report comes from different generic hardware error source will be
interleaved.

In this patch, a sequence number is prefixed to each line of error
report.  So that, even if they are interleaved, they still can be
distinguished by the prefixed sequence number.
