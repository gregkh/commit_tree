Fujitsu tablet extras driver

This patch adds support for some of the devices within a wide variety
of Fujitsu Tablet Computers, both convertibles and slates. Primarily
it allows for the automatic detection of the tablet/notebook mode for
convertible tablet pc's, and orientation for docked slates. It also
adds support for the application panel buttons usually found next to
the tablet screen, and docking station detection for slates.
