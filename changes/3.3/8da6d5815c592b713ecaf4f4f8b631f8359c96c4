Btrfs: added btrfs_find_all_roots()

This function gets a byte number (a data extent), collects all the leafs
pointing to it and walks up the trees to find all fs roots pointing to those
leafs. It also returns the list of all leafs pointing to that extent.

It does proper locking for the involved trees, can be used on busy file
systems and honors delayed refs.
