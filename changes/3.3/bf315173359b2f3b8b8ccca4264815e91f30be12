regmap: Allow drivers to reinitialise the register cache at runtime

Sometimes the register map information may change in ways that drivers can
discover at runtime. For example, new revisions of a device may add new
registers. Support runtime discovery by drivers by allowing the register
cache to be reinitialised with a new function regmap_reinit_cache() which
discards the existing cache and creates a new one.
