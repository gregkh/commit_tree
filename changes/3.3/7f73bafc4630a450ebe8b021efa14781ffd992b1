m68k: simpler m68k and ColdFire CPU's can use generic csum code

We have two implementations of the IP checksuming code for the m68k arch.
One uses the more advanced instructions available in 68020 and above
processors, the other uses the simpler instructions available on the
original 68000 processors and the modern ColdFire processors.

This simpler code is pretty much the same as the generic lib implementation
of the IP csum functions. So lets just switch over to using that. That
means we can completely remove the checksum_no.c file, and only have the
local fast code used for the more complex 68k CPU family members.
