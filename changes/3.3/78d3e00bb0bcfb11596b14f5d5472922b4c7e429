watchdog: fix error in probe() of s3c2410_wdt (reset at booting)

Probe function of s3c2410 watchdog calls request_irq before initializing
required value (wdt_count). This incurs resetting watchdog counter value
and watchdog-reboot during booting up.

This patch addresses such an issue by calling request_irq later.

Error handling in probe function and calling oder in remove function are
also revised accordingly.
