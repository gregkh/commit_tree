USB: Remove duplicate USB 3.0 hub feature #defines.

Somehow we ended up with duplicate hub feature #defines in ch11.h.
Tatyana Brokhman first created the USB 3.0 hub feature macros in 2.6.38
with commit 0eadcc09203349b11ca477ec367079b23d32ab91 "usb: USB3.0 ch11
definitions".  In 2.6.39, I modified a patch from John Youn that added
similar macros in a different place in the same file, and committed
dbe79bbe9dcb22cb3651c46f18943477141ca452 "USB 3.0 Hub Changes".

Some of the #defines used different names for the same values.  Others
used exactly the same names with the same values, like these gems:

 #define USB_PORT_FEAT_BH_PORT_RESET     28
...
 #define USB_PORT_FEAT_BH_PORT_RESET            28

According to my very geeky husband (who looked it up in the C99 spec),
it is allowed to have object-like macros with duplicate names as long as
the replacement list is exactly the same.  However, he recalled that
some compilers will give warnings when they find duplicate macros.  It's
probably best to remove the duplicates in the stable tree, so that the
code compiles for everyone.

The macros are now fixed to move the feature requests that are specific
to USB 3.0 hubs into a new section (out of the USB 2.0 hub feature
section), and use the most common macro name.

This patch should be backported to 2.6.39.
