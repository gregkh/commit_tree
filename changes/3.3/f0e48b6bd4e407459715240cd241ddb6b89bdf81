ALSA: virtuoso: Xonar DS: fix polarity of front output

The two DACs for the front output and the surround/center/LFE/back
outputs are wired up out of phase, so when channels are duplicated,
their sound can cancel out each other and result in a weaker bass
response.  To fix this, reverse the polarity of the neutron flow to
the front output.
