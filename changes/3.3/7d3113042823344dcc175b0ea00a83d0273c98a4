caif: Stash away hijacked skb destructor and call it later

This patch adds functionality for avoiding orphaning SKB too early.
The original skb is stashed away and the original destructor is called
from the hi-jacked flow-on callback. If CAIF interface goes down and a
hi-jacked SKB exists, the original skb->destructor is restored.
