ARM: restart: remove poodle restart handler

The poodle restart handler was added in 74617fb6b8 (3593/1: Add reboot
and shutdown handlers for Zaurus handhelds), and at that time it was
necessary to deal with the RCSR register.  This commit also forced all
restarts to use the 'hard' restart method.

In dc38e2ad53 (pxa: Fix RCSR handling), the RCSR handling was removed,
leaving just the forcing to use a 'hard' restart.  As hard restarts are
the default (in the absense of a reboot= command line argument), this
seems pointless.  In any case, Richard Purdie says:

So, lets remove the unnecessary interception and rely on the default
restart mode.
