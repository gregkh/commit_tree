m68k: use ColdFire MMU read/write bit flags when ioremapping

The ColdFire MMU has separate read and write bits, unlike the Motorola
m68k MMU which has a single read-only bit.

Define a _PAGE_READWRITE value for the Motorola MMU, which is 0, so we
can unconditionaly include that in the page table entry bits when setting
up ioremapped pages.
