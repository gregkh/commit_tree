GFS2: Add readahead to sequential directory traversal

This patch adds read-ahead capability to GFS2's
directory hash table management.  It greatly improves
performance for some directory operations.  For example:
In one of my file systems that has 1000 directories, each
of which has 1000 files, time to execute a recursive
ls (time ls -fR /mnt/gfs2 > /dev/null) was reduced
from 2m2.814s on a stock kernel to 0m45.938s.
