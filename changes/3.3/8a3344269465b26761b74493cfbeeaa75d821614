btrfs: silence warning in raid array setup

Raid array setup code creates an extent buffer in an usual way. When the
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is > super block size, the extent pages are not marked
up-to-date, which triggers a WARN_ON in the following
write_extent_buffer call. Add an explicit up-to-date call to silence the
warning.
