x86, tsc: Skip TSC synchronization checks for tsc=reliable

tsc=reliable boot parameter is supposed to skip all the TSC
stablility checks during boot time.

On a 8-socket system where we want to run an experiment with the
"tsc=reliable" boot option, TSC synchronization checks are not
getting skipped and marking the TSC as not stable.

Check for tsc_clocksource_reliable (which is set via
tsc=reliable or for platforms supporting synthetic TSC_RELIABLE
feature bit etc) and when set, skip the TSC synchronization
tests during boot.
