drm/radeon: introduce a sub allocator and convert ib pool to it v4

Somewhat specializaed sub-allocator designed to perform sub-allocation
for command buffer not only for current cs ioctl but for future command
submission ioctl as well. Patch also convert current ib pool to use
the sub allocator. Idea is that ib poll buffer can be share with other
command buffer submission not having 64K granularity.

v2 Harmonize pool handling and add suspend/resume callback to pin/unpin
sa bo (tested on rv280, rv370, r420, rv515, rv610, rv710, redwood, cayman,
rs480, rs690, rs880)
v3 Simplify allocator
v4 Fix radeon_ib_get error path to properly free fence
