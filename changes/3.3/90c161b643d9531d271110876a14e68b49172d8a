target: use \n as a separator for configuration

The command
| echo rd_pages=32768 > ramdisk/control

Does not work because it writes "rd_pages=32768\n" and the parser which
matches for "rd_pages=%d" does not recognize it due to the \n. One way
of fixing this would be using "echo -n" instead.
This patch adds \n to the list of separators so we don't have to use the
-n argument which I find is more convinient.
