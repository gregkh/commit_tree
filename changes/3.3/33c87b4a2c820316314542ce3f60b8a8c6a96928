mtd: mtdcore: export symbols cleanup

The mtdcore.c file is a bit inconsistent - some EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL declarations
follow the corresponding functions, some are placed at the end. This patch
harmonizes the file so that EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL declarations follow the
corresponding function.

It also removes few extra newlines and trailing white-spaces.
