Revert "microblaze: Add topology init"

This reverts commit d761f0c521868e59cd0bc59159cbdb4686fe210d.

Patch: "cpu: Register a generic CPU device on architectures that currently do not"
(sha1: 9f13a1fd452f11c18004ba2422a6384b424ec8a9)

selects GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES for Microblaze which register cpu.
My patch was done in the same time that's why cpu was registered twice which
caused this warning log:
