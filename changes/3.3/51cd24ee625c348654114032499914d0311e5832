pinctrl: don't create a device for each pin controller

Pin controllers should already be instantiated as a device, so there's
no need for the pinctrl core to create a new struct device for each
controller.

This allows the controller's real name to be used in the mux mapping
table, rather than e.g. "pinctrl.0", "pinctrl.1", etc.

This necessitates removal of the PINMUX_MAP_PRIMARY*() macros, since
their sole purpose was to hard-code the .ctrl_dev_name field to be
"pinctrl.0".
