init/main.c: Execute lockdep_init() as early as possible

This patch fixes a lockdep warning on ARM platforms:

  [    0.000000] WARNING: lockdep init error! Arch code didn't call lockdep_init() early enough?
  [    0.000000] Call stack leading to lockdep invocation was:
  [    0.000000]  [<c00164bc>] save_stack_trace_tsk+0x0/0x90
  [    0.000000]  [<ffffffff>] 0xffffffff

The warning is caused by printk inside smp_setup_processor_id().

It is safe to do this because lockdep_init() doesn't depend on
smp_setup_processor_id(), so improve things that printk can be
called as early as possible without lockdep complaint.
