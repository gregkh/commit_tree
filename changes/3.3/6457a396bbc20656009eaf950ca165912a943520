MIPS Kprobes: Support branch instructions probing

This patch provides support for kprobes on branch instructions. The branch
instruction at the probed address is actually emulated and not executed
out-of-line like other normal instructions. Instead the delay-slot instruction
is copied and single stepped out of line.

At the time of probe hit, the original branch instruction is evaluated
and the target cp0_epc is computed similar to compute_retrun_epc(). It
is also checked if the delay slot instruction can be skipped, which is
true if there is a NOP in delay slot or branch is taken in case of
branch likely instructions. Once the delay slot instruction is single
stepped the normal execution resume with the cp0_epc updated the earlier
computed cp0_epc as per the branch instructions.
