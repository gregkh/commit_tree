Revert "RTC: sa1100: support sa1100, pxa and mmp soc families"

This reverts commit 7cea00657dd4daef66ad95e976d5d67ed94cb97e.

The sa1100 cleanups fatally broke the SA1100 RTC driver - the first
hint that something is wrong are these compiler warnings:

drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c:42:1: warning: "RCNR" redefined

and the second problem, which is far more severe, are the different
register layouts, resulting in the wrong registers being read on
SA11x0 platforms.  This patch adds:

	#define RCNR           0x00    /* RTC Count Register */
	#define RTAR           0x04    /* RTC Alarm Register */
	#define RTSR           0x08    /* RTC Status Register */
	#define RTTR           0x0c    /* RTC Timer Trim Register */

but the SA11x0 registers are:

	#define RTAR            __REG(0x90010000)  /* RTC Alarm Reg. */
	#define RCNR            __REG(0x90010004)  /* RTC CouNt Reg. */
	#define RTTR            __REG(0x90010008)  /* RTC Trim Reg. */
	#define RTSR            __REG(0x90010010)  /* RTC Status Reg. */
