regmap: Do not call regcache_exit from regcache_lzo_init error path

Calling regcache_exit from regcache_lzo_init is first of all a layering
violation and secondly will cause double frees. regcache_exit will free buffers
allocated by the core, but the core will also free the same buffers when the
cacheops init callback returns an error. Thus we end up with a double free.
Fix this by not calling regcache_exit but only free those buffers which, have
been allocated in this function.
