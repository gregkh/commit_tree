ath6kl: Implement support for QOS-enable and QOS-disable from userspace

In order to allow user space based QOS control we use the available debugfs
infrastructure. With this feature, user can make changes to qos parameters,
thereby allowing creation and deletion of user defined priority streams and
features like uapsd. This feature has been added for testing purposes.

All 21 parameters for the create_qos command are mandatory in the correct
order. They have to be written to the create_qos file in
the ath6kl debug directory. These parameters(in order) are:

1)user priority
2)direction
3)traffic class
4)traffic type
5)voice PS capability
6)min service intvl
7)max service intvl
8)inactivity intvl
9)suspension intvl
10)serv start time
11)tsid
12)nominal msdu
13)max msdu
14)min data rate
15)mean data rate
16)peak data rate
17)max burst size
18)delay bound
19)min phy rate
20)surplus bw allowance
21)medium time

To create a qos stream:

echo "6 2 3 1 1 9999999 9999999 9999999 7777777 0 6 45000 200 56789000
56789000 5678900 0 0 9999999 20000 0" > create_qos

delete_qos requires 2 parameters:

1)traffic class
2)tsid

To delete a qos stream:

echo "3 1" > delete_qos
