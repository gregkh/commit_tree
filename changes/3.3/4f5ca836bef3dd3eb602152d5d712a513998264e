HID: hid-input: add support for HID devices reporting Battery Strength

Some HID devices, such as my Bluetooth mouse, report their battery
strength as an event.  Rather than passing it through as a strange
absolute input event, this patch registers it with the power_supply
subsystem as a battery, so that the device's Battery Strength can be
reported to usermode.

The battery appears in sysfs names
/sys/class/power_supply/hid-<UNIQ>-battery, and it is a child of the
battery-containing device, so it should be clear what it's the battery of.

Unfortunately on my current Fedora 16 system, while the battery does
appear in the UI, it is listed as a Laptop Battery with 0% charge (since
it ignores the "capacity" property of the battery and instead computes
it from the "energy*" fields, which we can't supply given the limited
information contained within the HID Report).

Still, this patch is the first step.
