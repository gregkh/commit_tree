PM / Domains: Automatically update overoptimistic latency information

Measure the time of execution of the .stop(), .start(), .save_state()
and .restore_state() PM domain device callbacks and if the result
is greater than the corresponding latency value stored in the
device's struct generic_pm_domain_data object, replace the inaccurate
value with the measured time.

Do analogously for the PM domains' .power_off() and .power_off()
callbacks.
