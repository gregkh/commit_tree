[S390] 3215 deadlock with tty_wakeup

The 3215 driver calls tty_wakeup from irq context while holding the
device spinlock. If printk is called by any function on the callchain
starting from tty_wakeup the system deadlocks on the device spinlock.
Using a tasklet to call tty_wakup solves the problem.
