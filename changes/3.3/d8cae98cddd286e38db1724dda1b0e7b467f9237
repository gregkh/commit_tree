USB: update documentation for usbmon

The documentation for usbmon is out of date; the usbfs "devices" file
now exists in /sys/kernel/debug/usb rather than /proc/bus/usb.  This
patch (as1505) updates the documentation accordingly, and also
mentions that the necessary information can be found by running lsusb.
