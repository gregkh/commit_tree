perf tools: make -C consistent across commands (for cpu list arg)

Currently the meaning of -C varies by perf command: for perf-top,
perf-stat, perf-record it means cpu list. For perf-report it means comm
list. Then perf-annotate, perf-report and perf-script use -c for cpu
list.

Fix annotate, report and script to use -C for cpu list to be consistent
with top, stat and record. This means report needs to use -c for comm
list which does introduce a backward compatibility change.

v1 -> v2
- update perf-script.txt too
