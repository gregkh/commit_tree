ARM: move initialization of the high_memory variable earlier

Some upcoming changes must know the VMALLOC_START value, which is based
on high_memory, before bootmem_init() is called.

The best location to set it is in sanity_check_meminfo() where the needed
computation is already done, and in the non MMU case it is trivial to do
now that the meminfo array is already sorted at that point.
