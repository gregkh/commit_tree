drm/radeon/kms: properly set accel working flag and bailout when false

If accel is not working many subsystem such as the ib pool might not be
initialized properly that can lead to segfault inside kernel when cs
ioctl is call with non working acceleration. To avoid this make sure
the accel working flag is false when an error in GPU startup happen and
return EBUSY from cs ioctl if accel is not working.
