virtio: expose added descriptors immediately.

A virtio driver does virtqueue_add_buf() multiple times before finally
calling virtqueue_kick(); previously we only exposed the added buffers
in the virtqueue_kick() call.  This means we don't need a memory
barrier in virtqueue_add_buf(), but it reduces concurrency as the
device (ie. host) can't see the buffers until the kick.

In the unusual (but now possible) case where a driver does add_buf()
and get_buf() without doing a kick, we do need to insert one before
our counter wraps.  Otherwise we could wrap num_added, and later on
not realize that we have passed the marker where we should have
kicked.
