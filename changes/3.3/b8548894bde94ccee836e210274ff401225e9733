nfsd4: be forgiving in the absence of the recovery directory

If the recovery directory doesn't exist, then behavior after a reboot
will be suboptimal.  But it's unnecessarily harsh to then prevent the
nfsv4 server from working at all.  Instead just print a warning
(already done in nfsd4_init_recdir()) and soldier on.
