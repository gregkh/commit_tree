Btrfs: run chunk allocations while we do delayed refs

Btrfs tries to batch extent allocation tree changes to improve performance
and reduce metadata trashing.  But it doesn't allocate new metadata chunks
while it is doing allocations for the extent allocation tree.

This commit changes the delayed refence code to do chunk allocations if we're
getting low on room.  It prevents crashes and improves performance.
