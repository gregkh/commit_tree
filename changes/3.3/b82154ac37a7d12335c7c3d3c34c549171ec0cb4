TTY: extract /dev/tty handling from tty_open

This one is special to others (done in the next patch). We have the
tty directly, not its driver and index. So this will reside in a
separation function. In the next patch, the rest will be moved to
another function.

So now we set neither driver nor index. Hence we need to init driver
and check whether we are supposed to put a ref of that.
