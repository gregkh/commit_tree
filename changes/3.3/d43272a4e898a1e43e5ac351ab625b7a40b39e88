[media] DVB: dib0700, add support for Nova-TD LEDs

Add an override of read_status to intercept lock status. This allows
us to switch LEDs appropriately on and off with signal un/locked.

The second phase is to override sleep to properly turn off both.

This is a hackish way to achieve that.

Thanks to Mike Krufky for his help.
