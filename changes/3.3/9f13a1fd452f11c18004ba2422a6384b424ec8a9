cpu: Register a generic CPU device on architectures that currently do not

frv, h8300, m68k, microblaze, openrisc, score, um and xtensa currently
do not register a CPU device.  Add the config option GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES
which causes a generic CPU device to be registered for each present CPU,
and make all these architectures select it.

Richard Weinberger <richard@nod.at> covered UML and suggested using
per_cpu.
