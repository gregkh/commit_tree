ARM: 7357/1: perf: fix overflow handling for xscale2 PMUs

xscale2 PMUs indicate overflow not via the PMU control register, but by
a separate overflow FLAG register instead.

This patch fixes the xscale2 PMU code to use this register to detect
to overflow and ensures that we clear any pending overflow when
disabling a counter.
