iwlwifi: fix rate-scaling algorithm for BT combo devices

iwlwifi tries to avoid using antenna B in BT combo devices when BT
is active. A bug in the rate-scaling algorithm was causing the combo
device to never attempt MIMO rates. Fix the algorithm to
opportunistically try MIMO rates when BT traffic is low.
