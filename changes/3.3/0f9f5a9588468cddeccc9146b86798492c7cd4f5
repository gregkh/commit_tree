xen/granttable: Introducing grant table V2 stucture

This patch introduces new structures of grant table V2, grant table V2 is an
extension from V1. Grant table is shared between guest and Xen, and Xen is
responsible to do corresponding work for grant operations, such as: figure
out guest's grant table version, perform different actions based on
different grant table version, etc. Although full-page structure of V2
is different from V1, it play the same role as V1.
