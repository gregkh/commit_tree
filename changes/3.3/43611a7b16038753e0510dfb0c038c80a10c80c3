Bluetooth: Increase HCI reset timeout in hci_dev_do_close

I've noticed that my CSR usb dongle was not working if it was plugged in when
PC was booting. It looks like I get two HCI reset command complete events (see
hcidump logs below).
The root cause is reset called from off_timer. Timeout for this reset to
complete is set to 250ms and my bt dongle requires more time for replying with
command complete event. After that, chip seems to reply with reset command
complete event for next non-reset command.

Attached patch increase mentioned timeout to HCI_INIT_TIMEOUT, this value is
already used for timeouting hci_reset_req in hci_dev_reset().

This might also be related to BT not working after suspend that was reported
here some time ago.
