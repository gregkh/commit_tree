Bluetooth: btusb: also be quiet when suspending

usb_submit_urb() returns -ENODEV when a usb device is disconnected. In
commit 4935f1c164ac528dff3538f97953b385ba500710 ("Bluetooth: btusb: be
quiet on device disconnect") I stopped treating that return as an error
in the three btusb_*_complete() functions.

It turns out btusb_send_frame() generates a similar error if the system
is suspended while the bluetooth usb device is enabled. The sensible
thing to do here seems to be to treat -ENODEV (and -EPERM) just like the
btusb_*_complete() functions now do.
