e1000e: Convert printks to pr_<level>

Based on the original patch from Joe Perches.
Use the current logging styles.
pr_<level> conversions are now prefixed with "e1000e:"
Correct a couple of defects where the trailing NTU may have
been printed on a separate line because of an interleaving
hex_dump.
Remove unnecessary uses of KERN_CONT and use single pr_info()s
to avoid any possible output interleaving from other modules.
Coalesce formats as appropriate.
Remove an extra space from a broken across lines
coalescing of "Link Status " and " Change".

-v2 Remove changes to Copyright string
