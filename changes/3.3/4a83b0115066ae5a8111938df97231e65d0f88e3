[media] tm6000: rewrite IR support

The IR support were broken on my tests with HVR-900H. Also,
there were several issues on the current implementation.
This patch is a major rewrite of the IR support for this
	- Improve debug messages;
	- Don't do polling for interrrupt based IR;
	- Add proper support for RC-5 protocol;
	- Always provide 16 bits for NEC and RC-5;
	- Fix polling code;
	- Split polling functions from URB Interrupt ones;
	- Don't hardcode the XTAL reference for tm6000 IR;
	- If a URB submit fails, retries after 100ms;
	- etc.

Tested on Hauppauge HVR-900H, with RC-5 and NEC remotes.

Issues on IR handling, on this device:
	- Repeat events aren't detected (neither on NEC or RC-5);
	- NEC codes are always provided with 16 bits.
