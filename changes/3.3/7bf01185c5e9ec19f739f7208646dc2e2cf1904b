USB: Adding #define in hub_configure() and hcd.c file

This patch is in succession of previous patch
commit c8421147926fcacf53081a36438a0bed394da9f5
        xHCI: Adding #define values used for hub descriptor

Hub descriptors characteristics #defines values are added in
hub_configure() in place of magic numbers as asked by Alan Stern.
And the indentation for switch and case is changed to be same.

Some #defines values are added in ch11.h for defining hub class
protocols and used in hub.c and hcd.c in which magic values were
used for hub class protocols.
