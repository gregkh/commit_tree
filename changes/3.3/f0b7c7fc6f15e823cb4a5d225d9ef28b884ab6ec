[media] media: vb2: fix queueing of userptr buffers with null buffer pointer

Heuristic that checks if the memory pointer has been changed lacked a check
if the pointer was actually provided by the userspace, what allowed one to
queue a NULL pointer which was accepted without further checking. This
patch fixes this issue.
