ipv4: use a 64bit load/store in output path

gcc compiler is smart enough to use a single load/store if we
memcpy(dptr, sptr, 8) on x86_64, regardless of
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE

In IP header, daddr immediately follows saddr, this wont change in the
future. We only need to make sure our flowi4 (saddr,daddr) fields wont
break the rule.
