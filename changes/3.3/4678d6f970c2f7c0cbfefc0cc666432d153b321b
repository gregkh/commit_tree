virtio_blk: fix config handler race

Fix a theoretical race related to config work
handler: a config interrupt might happen
after we flush config work but before we
reset the device. It will then cause the
config work to run during or after reset.

Two problems with this:
- if this runs after device is gone we will get use after free
- access of config while reset is in progress is racy
(as layout is changing).

As a solution
1. flush after reset when we know there will be no more interrupts
2. add a flag to disable config access before reset
