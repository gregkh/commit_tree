ARM: omap: fix wrapped error messages in omap_hwmod.c

While trying to debug my OMAP platforms, they emitted this message:

omap_hwmod: %s: enabled state can only be entered from initialized, idle, or disabled state

The following backtrace said it was from a function called '_enable',
which didn't provide much clue.  Grepping didn't find it either.

The message is wrapped, so unwrap the message so grep can find it.  Do
the same for three other messages in this file.
