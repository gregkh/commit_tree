gpio/samsung: Add device tree support for EXYNOS4

As gpio chips get registered, a device tree node which represents the
gpio chip is searched and attached to it. A translate function is also
provided to convert the gpio specifier into actual platform settings
for pin function selection, pull up/down and driver strength settings.
