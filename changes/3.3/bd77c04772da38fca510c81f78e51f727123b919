module: struct module_ref should contains long fields

module_ref contains two "unsigned int" fields.

Thats now too small, since some machines can open more than 2^32 files.

Check commit 518de9b39e8 (fs: allow for more than 2^31 files) for
reference.

We can add an aligned(2 * sizeof(unsigned long)) attribute to force
alloc_percpu() allocating module_ref areas in single cache lines.
