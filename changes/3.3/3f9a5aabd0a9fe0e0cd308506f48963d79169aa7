floppy: Cleanup disk->queue before caling put_disk() if add_disk() was never called

add_disk() takes gendisk reference on request queue. If driver failed during
initialization and never called add_disk() then that extra reference is not
taken. That reference is put in put_disk(). floppy driver allocates the
disk, allocates queue, sets disk->queue and then relizes that floppy
controller is not present. It tries to tear down everything and tries to
put a reference down in put_disk() which was never taken.

In such error cases cleanup disk->queue before calling put_disk() so that
we never try to put down a reference which was never taken in first place.
