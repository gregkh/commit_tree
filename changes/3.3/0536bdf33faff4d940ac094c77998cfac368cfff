ARM: move iotable mappings within the vmalloc region

In order to remove the build time variation between different SOCs with
regards to VMALLOC_END, the iotable mappings are now allocated inside
the vmalloc region.  This allows for VMALLOC_END to be identical across
all machines.

The value for VMALLOC_END is now set to 0xff000000 which is right where
the consistent DMA area starts.

To accommodate all static mappings on machines with possible highmem usage,
the default vmalloc area size is changed to 240 MB so that VMALLOC_START
is no higher than 0xf0000000 by default.
