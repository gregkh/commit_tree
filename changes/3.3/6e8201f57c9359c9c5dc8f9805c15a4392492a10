mmc: core: add the capability for broken voltage

There is an understood mismatch between the voltage the host controller is
set to and the voltage supplied to the card by a fixed voltage regulator.
Teaching the driver to accept the mismatch is overly complicated.  Instead
just accept the regulator's voltage.

This patch adds MMC_CAP2_BROKEN_VOLTAGE.

If the voltage didn't satisfy between min_uV and max_uV, try to change
the voltage in core.c.  When changing the voltage, maybe use
regulator_set_voltage().

In regulator_set_voltage(), check the below condition.

	/* sanity check */
	if (!rdev->desc->ops->set_voltage &&
	    !rdev->desc->ops->set_voltage_sel) {
		ret = -EINVAL;
		goto out;
	}

If some board should use the fixed-regulator, always return -EINVAL.
Then, eMMC didn't initialize always.

So if use a fixed-regulator, we need to add the MMC_CAP2_BROKEN_VOLTAGE.
