rcu: Avoid needlessly IPIing CPUs at GP end

If a CPU enters dyntick-idle mode with callbacks pending, it will need
an IPI at the end of the grace period.  However, if it exits dyntick-idle
mode before the grace period ends, it will be needlessly IPIed at the
end of the grace period.

Therefore, this commit clears the per-CPU rcu_awake_at_gp_end flag
when a CPU determines that it does not need it.  This in turn requires
disabling interrupts across much of rcu_prepare_for_idle() in order to
avoid having nested interrupts clearing this state out from under us.
