md/raid5: writes should get directed to replacement as well as original.

When writing, we need to submit two writes, one to the original, and
one to the replacement - if there is a replacement.

If the write to the replacement results in a write error, we just fail
the device.  We only try to record write errors to the original.

When writing for recovery, we shouldn't write to the original.  This
will be addressed in a subsequent patch that generally addresses
recovery.
