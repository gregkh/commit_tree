md/raid10: Allow replacement device to be replace old drive.

When recovery finish and spare_active is called, check for a
replace that might have just become fully synced and mark it
as such, marking the original as failed.

Then when the original is removed, move the replacement into
its position.

This means that 'replacement' and spontaneously become NULL in some
situations.  Make sure we check for those.
It also means that 'rdev' and 'replacement' could appear to be
identical - check for that too.
