timer: Use debugobjects to catch deletion of uninitialized timers

del_timer_sync() calls debug_object_assert_init() to assert that
a timer has been initialized before calling lock_timer_base().
lock_timer_base() would spin forever on a NULL(uninit-ed) base.
The check is added to del_timer() to prevent silent failure, even
though it would not get stuck in an infinite loop.
