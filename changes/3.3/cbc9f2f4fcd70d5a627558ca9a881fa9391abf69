netfilter: nf_nat: export NAT definitions to userspace

Export the NAT definitions to userspace. So far userspace (specifically,
iptables) has been copying the headers files from include/net. Also
rename some structures and definitions in preparation for IPv6 NAT.
Since these have never been officially exported, this doesn't affect
existing userspace code.
