memblock: Don't allow archs to override memblock_nid_range()

memblock_nid_range() is used to implement memblock_[try_]alloc_nid().
The generic version determines the range by walking early_node_map
with for_each_mem_pfn_range().  The generic version is defined __weak
to allow arch override.

Currently, only sparc overrides it; however, with the previous update
to the generic implementation, there isn't much to be gained with arch
override.  Sparc would behave exactly the same with the generic
implementation.

This patch disallows arch override for memblock_nid_range() and make
both generic and sparc versions static.

sparc is only compile tested.
