module: fix broken isapnp handling in file2alias

Handling of isapnp module aliases was broken by commit
626596e295d477c0fefa08cd5daa7dd011b1bb2c by changing "isapnp" string to "isa".
The code was then modified by commit
e49ce14150c64b29a8dd211df785576fa19a9858 but this bug remained.

Change the string back to "isapnp".
