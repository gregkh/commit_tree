zaurus: Add ID for C-750/C-760/C-860/SL-C3000 PDA in MDLM mode

In 16adf5d07987d93675945f3cecf0e33706566005 I removed an over-broad
alias that caused zaurus.ko to bind to unrelated devices.
I had a report that at least one valid case no longer auto-loads because of this.
This patch adds an ID for that case.
