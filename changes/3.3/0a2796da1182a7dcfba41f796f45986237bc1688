m68k: add ColdFire FPU support for the V4e ColdFire CPUs

The V4e ColdFire CPU family also has an integrated FPU (as well as the MMU).
So add code to support this hardware along side the existing m68k FPU code.

The ColdFire FPU is of course different to all previous 68k FP units. It is
close in operation to the 68060, but not completely compatible. The biggest
issue to deal with is that the ColdFire FPU multi-move instructions are
different. It does not support multi-moving the FP control registers, and
the multi-move of the FP data registers uses a different instruction
mnemonic.
