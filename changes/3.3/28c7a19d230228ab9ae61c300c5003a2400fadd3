dmaengine/ste_dma40: Add support to use lcla area from esram

This patch provides an option of having the lcla (link address)
in ESRAM instead of allocating it. The bool value (use_esram_lcla)
in the stedma40_platform_data if set to true, then the lcla
address would be taken from platform resources. Also, the
corresponding esram regulator is managed in the
suspend/resume functions.
