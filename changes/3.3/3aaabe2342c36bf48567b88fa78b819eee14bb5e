tcp buffer limitation: per-cgroup limit

This patch uses the "tcp.limit_in_bytes" field of the kmem_cgroup to
effectively control the amount of kernel memory pinned by a cgroup.

This value is ignored in the root cgroup, and in all others,
caps the value specified by the admin in the net namespaces'
view of tcp_sysctl_mem.

If namespaces are being used, the admin is allowed to set a
value bigger than cgroup's maximum, the same way it is allowed
to set pretty much unlimited values in a real box.
