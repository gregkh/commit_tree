x86: Properly parenthesize cmpxchg() macro arguments

Quite oddly, all of the arguments passed through from the top
level macros to the second level which didn't need parentheses
had them, while the only expression (involving a parameter)
needing them didn't.

Very recently I got bitten by the lack thereof when using
something like "array + index" for the first operand, with
"array" being an array more narrow than int.
