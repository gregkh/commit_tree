printk, lockdep: Disable lock debugging on zap_locks()

zap_locks() is used by printk() in a last ditch effort to get data
out, clearly we cannot trust lock state after this so make it disable
lock debugging.

Also don't treat printk recursion through lockdep as a normal
recursion bug but try hard to get the lockdep splat out.
