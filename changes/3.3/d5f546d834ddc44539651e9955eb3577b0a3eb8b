rcu: Add rcutorture system-shutdown capability

Although it is easy to run rcutorture tests under KVM, there is currently
no nice way to run such a test for a fixed time period, collect all of
the rcutorture data, and then shut the system down cleanly.  This commit
therefore adds an rcutorture module parameter named "shutdown_secs" that
specified the run duration in seconds, after which rcutorture terminates
the test and powers the system down.  The default value for "shutdown_secs"
is zero, which disables shutdown.
