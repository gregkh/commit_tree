gpio: pl061: remove combined interrupt

Drivers should not have a dependency on NR_IRQS. Doing so may break with
SPARSE_IRQ enabled. As there are no in kernel users of the pl061 which
have multiple instances with their interrupts combined to a single parent
interrupt, remove this functionality. If this capability is needed later,
it could be supported more cleanly by just using a devicetree property.
