target: Use correct preempted registration sense code

The comments quote the right parts of the spec:

   * d) Establish a unit attention condition for the
   *    initiator port associated with every I_T nexus
   *    that lost its registration other than the I_T
   *    nexus on which the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT command
   *    was received, with the additional sense code set
   *    to REGISTRATIONS PREEMPTED.

and

   * e) Establish a unit attention condition for the initiator
   *    port associated with every I_T nexus that lost its
   *    persistent reservation and/or registration, with the
   *    additional sense code set to REGISTRATIONS PREEMPTED;

but the actual code accidentally uses ASCQ_2AH_RESERVATIONS_PREEMPTED
instead of ASCQ_2AH_REGISTRATIONS_PREEMPTED.  Fix this.
