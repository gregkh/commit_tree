block, cfq: fix race condition in cic creation path and tighten locking

cfq_get_io_context() would fail if multiple tasks race to insert cic's
for the same association.  This patch restructures
cfq_get_io_context() such that slow path insertion race is handled
properly.

Note that the restructuring also makes cfq_get_io_context() called
under queue_lock and performs both ioc and cfqd insertions while
holding both ioc and queue locks.  This is part of on-going locking
tightening and will be used to simplify synchronization rules.
