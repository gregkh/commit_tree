sched, nohz: Fix the idle cpu check in nohz_idle_balance

cpu bit in the nohz.idle_cpu_mask are reset in the first busy tick after
exiting idle. So during nohz_idle_balance(), intention is to double
check if the cpu that is part of the idle_cpu_mask is indeed idle before
going ahead in performing idle balance for that cpu.

Fix the cpu typo in the idle_cpu() check during nohz_idle_balance().
