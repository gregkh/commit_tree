i387: fix up some fpu_counter confusion

This makes sure we clear the FPU usage counter for newly created tasks,
just so that we start off in a known state (for example, don't try to
preload the FPU state on the first task switch etc).

It also fixes a thinko in when we increment the fpu_counter at task
switch time, introduced by commit 34ddc81a230b ("i387: re-introduce FPU
state preloading at context switch time").  We should increment the
*new* task fpu_counter, not the old task, and only if we decide to use
that state (whether lazily or preloaded).
