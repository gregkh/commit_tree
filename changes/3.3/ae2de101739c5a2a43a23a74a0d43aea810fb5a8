ARM: LPAE: Add identity mapping support for the 3-level page table format

With LPAE, the pgd is a separate page table with entries pointing to the
pmd. The identity_mapping_add() function needs to ensure that the pgd is
populated before populating the pmd level. The do..while blocks now loop
over the pmd in order to have the same implementation for the two page
table formats. The pmd_addr_end() definition has been removed and the
generic one used instead. The pmd clean-up is done in the pgd_free()
function.
