mm/vmscan.c: consider swap space when deciding whether to continue reclaim

It's pointless to continue reclaiming when we have no swap space and lots
of anon pages in the inactive list.

Without this patch, it is possible when swap is disabled to continue
trying to reclaim when there are only anonymous pages in the system even
though that will not make any progress.
