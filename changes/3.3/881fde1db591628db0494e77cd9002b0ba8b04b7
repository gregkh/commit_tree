powerpc: hugetlb: modify include usage for FSL BookE code

The original 32-bit hugetlb implementation used PPC64 vs PPC32 to
determine which code path to take.  However, the final hugetlb
implementation for 64-bit FSL ended up shared with the FSL
32-bit code so the actual check needs to be FSL_BOOK3E vs
everything else.  This patch changes the include protections to
reflect this.

There are also a couple of related comment fixes.
