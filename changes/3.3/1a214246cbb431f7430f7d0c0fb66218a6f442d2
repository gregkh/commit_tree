KVM: make checks stricter in coalesced_mmio_in_range()

My testing version of Smatch complains that addr and len come from
the user and they can wrap.  The path is:
  -> kvm_vm_ioctl()
     -> kvm_vm_ioctl_unregister_coalesced_mmio()
        -> coalesced_mmio_in_range()

I don't know what the implications are of wrapping here, but we may
as well fix it, if only to silence the warning.
