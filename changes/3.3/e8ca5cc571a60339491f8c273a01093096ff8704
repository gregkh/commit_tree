GFS2: let spectator mount do read only recovery

Previously, a spectator mount would not even attempt to do
journal recovery for a failed node.  This meant that if all
mounted nodes were spectators, everyone would be stuck after
a node failed, all waiting for recovery to be performed.
This is unnecessary since the failed node had a clean journal.

Instead, allow a spectator mount to do a partial "read only"
recovery, which means it will check if the failed journal is
clean, and if so, report a successful recovery.  If the failed
journal is not clean, it reports that journal recovery failed.
This makes it work the same as a read only mount on a read only
block device.
