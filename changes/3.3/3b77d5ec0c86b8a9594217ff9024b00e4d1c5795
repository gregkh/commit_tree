cfg80211: relicense reg.c reg.h and genregdb.awk to ISC

Following the tradition we have had with ath5k, ath9k, CRDA,
wireless-regdb I'd like to license this code under the permissive ISC
license for the code sharing purposes with other OSes, it'd sure be nice
to help the landscape in this area. Although I am %82.89 owner of the
regulatory code I have asked every contributor to the regulatory code
and have receieved positive Acked-bys from everyone except two deceased
entities:

 o Frans Pop RIP 2010 [0]
	- Frans Pop <elendil@planet.nl>
	- Frans Pop <fjp@debian.org>
 o Nokia     RIP February, 11, 2011 [1], [2]
	- ext-yuri.ershov@nokia.com
	- kalle.valo@nokia.com

Frans Pop's contribution was a simple patch 55f98938, titled,
"wireless: remove trailing space in messages" which just add a \n
to some printk lines. I'm going to treat these additions as
uncopyrightable.

As for the contributions made by employees on behalf of Nokia
my contact point was Petri Karhula <petri.karhula@nokia.com> but
after one month he noted he had not been able to get traction from the
legal department on this request, as such it I proceeded by replacing
their contributions in previous patches.

The end goal is to help a clean rewrite that starts in userspace
that is shared under ISC license which currently is taking place with
the regulatory simulator [3].
