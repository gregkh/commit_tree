driver core: cpu: remove kernel warning when removing a cpu

With the movement of the cpu sysdev code to be real stuct devices, now
when we remove a cpu from the system, the driver core rightfully
complains that there is not a release method for this device.

For now, paper over this issue by quieting the driver core, but comment
this in detail.  This will be resolved in future kernels to be solved
properly.
