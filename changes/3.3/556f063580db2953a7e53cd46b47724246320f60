mtdoops: fix the oops_page_used array size

The array of unsigned long pointed by oops_page_used is allocated
by vmalloc which requires the size to be in bytes.

BITS_PER_LONG is equal to 32.
If we want to allocate memory for 32 pages with one bit per page then
32 / BITS_PER_LONG  is equal to 1 byte that is 8 bits.
To fix it we need to multiply the result by sizeof(unsigned long) equal to 4.
