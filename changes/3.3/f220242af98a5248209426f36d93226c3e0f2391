rcu: Make rcutorture test for hotpluggability before offlining CPUs

The rcutorture test now can automatically exercise CPU hotplug and
collect success statistics, which can be correlated with other rcutorture
activity.  This permits rcutorture to completely exercise RCU regardless
of what sort of userspace and filesystem layout is in use.  Unfortunately,
rcutorture is happy to attempt to offline CPUs that cannot be offlined,
for example, CPU 0 in both the x86 and ARM architectures.  Although this
allows rcutorture testing to proceed normally, it confounds attempts at
error analysis due to the resulting flood of spurious CPU-hotplug errors.

Therefore, this commit uses the new cpu_is_hotpluggable() function to
avoid attempting to offline CPUs that are not hotpluggable, which in
turn avoids spurious CPU-hotplug errors.
