[S390] cleanup entry point definition

The vmlinux file for s390 contains a currently unused entry point,
which is specified in two different locations: the linker script
and the makefile. As it happens both definitions are different and
the linker file is broken (_start does not exist) and the makefile
specifies an entry point which makes no sense (the SALIPL loader
entry point).

So lets get rid of one definition (the makefile) and use the entry
point of all other ipl methods (0x10000 -> startup) to be consistent.
