net: fix sleeping while atomic problem in sock mem_cgroup.

We can't scan the proto_list to initialize sock cgroups, as it
holds a rwlock, and we also want to keep the code generic enough to
avoid calling the initialization functions of protocols directly,

Convert proto_list_lock into a mutex, so we can sleep and do the
necessary allocations. This lock is seldom taken, so there shouldn't
be any performance penalties associated with that
