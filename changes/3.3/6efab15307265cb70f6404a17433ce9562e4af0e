ARM: 7239/1: integrator: explicitly select the serial drivers

The defconfig for the Integrator only include the serial drivers
for the PL010 as found in the Integrator/AP, to make sure we
don't loose the serial console we simply select both PL010 and
PL011 drivers from the Integrator Kconfig entries so they are
always included when applicable.
