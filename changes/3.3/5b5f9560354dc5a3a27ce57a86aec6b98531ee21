functionfs: unfuck failure exits on mount

* if you do dput() of root dentry, do *not* follow that with iput() of root
inode.
* while we are at it, don't do that dput() at all - you are leaving the pointer
in ->s_root and your ->kill_sb() will be very unhappy with that.  It will do
proper dput(), though, so the easiest way is to leave that to it entirely.
* freeing ->s_fs_info is also best left to ->kill_sb() (which will do it
anyway), especially since we leave the pointer in place.
* that xchg() in ->kill_sb() is not a bug per se, but it's a plain and simple
masturbation with fewer excuses than Onan had...
