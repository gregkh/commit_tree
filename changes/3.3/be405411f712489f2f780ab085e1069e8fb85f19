tpm: fix (ACPI S3) suspend regression

This patch fixes an (ACPI S3) suspend regression introduced in commit
68d6e6713fcb ("tpm: Introduce function to poll for result of self test")
and occurring with an Infineon TPM and tpm_tis and tpm_infineon drivers
active.

The suspend problem occurred if the TPM was disabled and/or deactivated
and therefore the TPM_PCRRead checking the result of the (asynchronous)
self test returned an error code which then caused the tpm_tis driver to
become inactive and this then seemed to have negatively influenced the
suspend support by the tpm_infineon driver...  Besides that the tpm_tis
drive may stay active even if the TPM is disabled and/or deactivated.
