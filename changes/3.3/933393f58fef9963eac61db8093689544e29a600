percpu: Remove irqsafe_cpu_xxx variants

We simply say that regular this_cpu use must be safe regardless of
preemption and interrupt state.  That has no material change for x86
and s390 implementations of this_cpu operations.  However, arches that
do not provide their own implementation for this_cpu operations will
now get code generated that disables interrupts instead of preemption.

-tj: This is part of on-going percpu API cleanup.  For detailed
     discussion of the subject, please refer to the following thread.
