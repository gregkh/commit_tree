r6040: fix typo in use of MCR0 register bits

Commit 4e16d6ebd65b4f2c4e3f780b4c5704beef64019c (r6040: define more MCR0
register bits) added #define values for MCR0 register bits and converted
uses of hardcoded magic values to uses of these defines.

However, one of the conversions looks suspicious:

 #define MCR0		0x00	/* Control register 0 */
+#define  MCR0_RCVEN	0x0002	/* Receive enable */
+#define  MCR0_XMTEN	0x1000	/* Transmission enable */

 	/* Init RDC private data */
-	lp->mcr0 = 0x1002;
+	lp->mcr0 = MCR0_XMTEN | MCR0;

I believe what was meant here was MCR0_XMTEN | MCR0_RCVEN, which makes
sense and matches the original values.
