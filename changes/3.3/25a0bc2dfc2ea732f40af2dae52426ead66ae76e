power_supply: add SCOPE attribute to power supplies

This adds a "scope" attribute to a power_supply, which indicates how
much of the system it powers.  It appears in sysfs as "scope" or in
the uevent file as POWER_SUPPLY_SCOPE=.  There are presently three
possible values:
	Unknown - unknown power topology
	System - the power supply powers the whole system
	Device - it powers a specific device, or tree of devices

A power supply which doesn't have a "scope" attribute should be assumed to
have "System" scope.

In general, usermode should assume that loss of all System-scoped power
supplies will power off the whole system, but any single one is sufficient
to power the system.
