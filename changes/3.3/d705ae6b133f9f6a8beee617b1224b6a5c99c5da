block: replace icq->changed with icq->flags

icq->changed was used for ICQ_*_CHANGED bits.  Rename it to flags and
access it under ioc->lock instead of using atomic bitops.
ioc_get_changed() is added so that the changed part can be fetched and
cleared as before.

icq->flags will be used to carry other flags.
