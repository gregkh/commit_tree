mm,slub,x86: decouple size of struct page from CONFIG_CMPXCHG_LOCAL

While implementing cmpxchg_double() on s390 I realized that we don't set
CONFIG_CMPXCHG_LOCAL despite the fact that we have support for it.

However setting that option will increase the size of struct page by
eight bytes on 64 bit, which we certainly do not want.  Also, it doesn't
make sense that a present cpu feature should increase the size of struct
page.

Besides that it looks like the dependency to CMPXCHG_LOCAL is wrong and
that it should depend on CMPXCHG_DOUBLE instead.

This patch:

If an architecture supports CMPXCHG_LOCAL this shouldn't result
automatically in larger struct pages if the SLUB allocator is used.
Instead introduce a new config option "HAVE_ALIGNED_STRUCT_PAGE" which
can be selected if a double word aligned struct page is required.  Also
update x86 Kconfig so that it should work as before.
