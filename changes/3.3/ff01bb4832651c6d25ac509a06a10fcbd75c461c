fs: move code out of buffer.c

Move invalidate_bdev, block_sync_page into fs/block_dev.c.  Export
kill_bdev as well, so brd doesn't have to open code it.  Reduce
buffer_head.h requirement accordingly.

Removed a rather large comment from invalidate_bdev, as it looked a bit
obsolete to bother moving.  The small comment replacing it says enough.
