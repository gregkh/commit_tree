powerpc: Fix unpaired __trace_hcall_entry and __trace_hcall_exit

 Unpaired calling of __trace_hcall_entry and __trace_hcall_exit could
 cause incorrect preempt count. And it might happen as the global
 variable hcall_tracepoint_refcount is checked separately before calling
 them.

 Instead, store the value that was used on entry in the stack frame
 and retreive it from there after the call
