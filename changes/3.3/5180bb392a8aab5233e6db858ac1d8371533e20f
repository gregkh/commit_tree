ARM/audit: include audit header and fix audit arch

Both bugs being fixed were introduced in:
29ef73b7a823b77a7cd0bdd7d7cded3fb6c2587b

Include linux/audit.h to fix below build errors:

  CC      arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.o
arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.c: In function 'syscall_trace':
arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.c:919: error: implicit declaration of function 'audit_syscall_exit'

This part of the patch is:
Reported-by: Axel Lin <axel.lin@gmail.com>
Reported-by: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com>
(They both provided patches to fix it)

This patch also (at the request of the list) fixes the fact that
ARM has both LE and BE versions however the audit code was called as if
it was always BE.  If audit userspace were to try to interpret the bits
it got from a LE system it would obviously do so incorrectly.  Fix this
by using the right arch flag on the right system.
