KVM: IA64: fix struct redefinition

There is the same struct definition in ia64 and kvm common code:
arch/ia64/kvm//kvm-ia64.c: At top level:
arch/ia64/kvm//kvm-ia64.c:777:8: error: redefinition of ‘struct kvm_io_range’
include/linux/kvm_host.h:62:8: note: originally defined here

So, rename kvm_io_range to kvm_ia64_io_range in ia64 code
