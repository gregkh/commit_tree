ARM: OMAP4: PM: Avoid omap4_pm_init() on OMAP4430 ES1.0

On OMAP4430 ES1.0, Power Management features are not supported.
Avoid omap4_pm_init() on ES1.0 silicon so that we can continue
to use same kernel binary to boot on all OMAP4 silicons.

The ES1.0 boot failure with OMAP4 PM series was because of
the clockdomain initialisation code. Hardware supervised
clockdomain mode isn't functional for all clockdomains
on OMAP4430 ES1.0 silicon so avoid the same.
