staging/wlags49_h2: Convert pci_table entries to PCI_DEVICE (if PCI_ANY_ID is used)

This patch converts pci_table entries to use the PCI_DEVICE macro,
if .subvendor and .subdevice are set to PCI_ANY_ID,
and thus improves readablity.

Since CH_Agere_Systems_Mini_PCI_V1 is defined as 0 in hermes_pci_versions
and neither the enum nor the value is used anywhere else, we can drop
the assignment of .driver_data as it is initialized as 0 by default.
