x86/reboot: Remove VersaLogic Menlow reboot quirk

This commit removes the reboot quirk originally added by commit
e19e074 ("x86: Fix reboot problem on VersaLogic Menlow boards").

Testing with a VersaLogic Ocelot (VL-EPMs-21a rev 1.00 w/ BIOS
6.5.102) revealed the following regarding the reboot hang
problem:

- v2.6.37 reboot=bios was needed.

- v2.6.38-rc1: behavior changed, reboot=acpi is needed,
  reboot=kbd and reboot=bios results in system hang.

- v2.6.38: VersaLogic patch (e19e074 "x86: Fix reboot problem on
  VersaLogic Menlow boards") was applied prior to v2.6.38-rc7.  This
  patch sets a quirk for VersaLogic Menlow boards that forces the use
  of reboot=bios, which doesn't work anymore.

- v3.2: It seems that commit 660e34c ("x86: Reorder reboot method
  preferences") changed the default reboot method to acpi prior to
  v3.0-rc1, which means the default behavior is appropriate for the
  Ocelot.  No VersaLogic quirk is required.

The Ocelot board used for testing can successfully reboot w/out
having to pass any reboot= arguments for all 3 current versions
of the BIOS.
