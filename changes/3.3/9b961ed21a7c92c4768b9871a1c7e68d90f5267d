offb: Add palette hack for qemu "standard vga" framebuffer

We rename the mach64 hack to "simple" since that's also applicable
to anything using VGA-style DAC IO ports (set to 8-bit DAC) and we
use it for qemu vga.

Note that this is keyed on a device-tree "compatible" property that
is currently only set by an upcoming version of SLOF when using the
qemu "pseries" platform. This is on purpose as other qemu ppc platforms
using OpenBIOS aren't properly setting the DAC to 8-bit at the time of
the writing of this patch.

We can fix OpenBIOS later to do that and add the required property, in
which case it will be matched by this change.
