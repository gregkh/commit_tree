misc: Remove max8997-muic sysfs attributes

The 'switch' sysfs attribute is used for
showing and setting the switch state of the device.
However, setting it from the userspace focibly is not appropriate.
And showing the state can be handled from
other places (e.g. external connector) in a unified manner.
This patch removes the sysfs attribute.
Plus, uevent messages for interrupts are also removed.

The initial max8997-muic driver is merged at:
