sock_diag: Introduce the meminfo nla core (v2)

Add a routine that dumps memory-related values of a socket.
It's made as an array to make it possible to add more stuff
here later without breaking compatibility.

Since v1: The SK_MEMINFO_ constants are in userspace
visible part of sock_diag.h, the rest is under __KERNEL__.
