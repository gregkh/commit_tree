crypto: drop selects of bogus Kconfig symbol

Commits 2cdc6899a8 ("crypto: ghash - Add GHASH digest algorithm for
GCM") and 0e1227d356 ("crypto: ghash - Add PCLMULQDQ accelerated
implementation") added "select CRYPTO_SHASH" to two entries. That
Kconfig symbol doesn't exist. These two selects are nops. Drop them.
