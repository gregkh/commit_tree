iwlwifi: add tm commands for indirect register access

Create new testmode commands to suppot indirect access
of peripheral register.
- IWL_TM_CMD_APP2DEV_INDIRECT_REG_READ32
- IWL_TM_CMD_APP2DEV_INDIRECT_REG_WRITE32

Meanwhile, add affix "DIRECT" into original register access
commands for better discrimination with new commands.
- IWL_TM_CMD_APP2DEV_DIRECT_REG_READ32
- IWL_TM_CMD_APP2DEV_DIRECT_REG_WRITE32
- IWL_TM_CMD_APP2DEV_DIRECT_REG_WRITE8
