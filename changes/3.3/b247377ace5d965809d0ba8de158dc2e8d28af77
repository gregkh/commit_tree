[media] dvb: remove bogus modulation check

This code is wrong as I should have coded it as SYS_DVBC, instead of
SYS_DVBS & friends. Anyway, this check has other problems

1) it does some "magic" by assuming that all QAM modulations are below
  QAM_AUTO;

2) it checks modulation parameters only for one delivery system.
   Or the core should check invalid parameters for all delivery
   systems, or it should let the frontend drivers do it;

3) frontend drivers should already be checking for invalid parameters
   (most of them do it, anyway);

4) not all modulations are mapped at fe->ops.info.caps, so it is not
   even possible to check for the valid modulations inside the core
   for some delivery systems;

5) The core check is incomplete anyway: it only checks for a few
   parameters. If moved into the core other parameters like bandwidth
   and fec should also be checked;

6) 2nd gen DVB-C uses OFDM. So, that test would fail for it.
