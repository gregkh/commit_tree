arm: pmu: allow platform specific irq enable/disable handling

This patch introduces .enable_irq and .disable_irq into
struct arm_pmu_platdata, so platform specific irq enablement
can be handled after request_irq, and platform specific irq
disablement can be handled before free_irq.

This patch is for support of  pmu irq routed from CTI on omap4.
