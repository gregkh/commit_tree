can: sja1000: fix isr hang when hw is unplugged under load

In the case of hotplug enabled devices (PCMCIA/PCIeC) the removal of the
hardware can cause an infinite loop in the common sja1000 isr.

Use the already retrieved status register to indicate a possible hardware
removal and double check by reading the mode register in sja1000_is_absent.
