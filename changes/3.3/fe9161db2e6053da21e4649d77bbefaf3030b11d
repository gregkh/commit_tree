PM / Hibernate: Thaw kernel threads in SNAPSHOT_CREATE_IMAGE ioctl path

In the SNAPSHOT_CREATE_IMAGE ioctl, if the call to hibernation_snapshot()
fails, the frozen tasks are not thawed.

And in the case of success, if we happen to exit due to a successful freezer
test, all tasks (including those of userspace) are thawed, whereas actually
we should have thawed only the kernel threads at that point. Fix both these
issues.
