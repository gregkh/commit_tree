PM: Run the driver callback directly if the subsystem one is not there

Make the PM core execute driver PM callbacks directly if the
corresponding subsystem callbacks are not present.

There are three reasons for doing that.  First, it reflects the
behavior of drivers/base/dd.c:really_probe() that runs the driver's
.probe() callback directly if the bus type's one is not defined, so
this change will remove one arbitrary difference between the PM core
and the remaining parts of the driver core.  Second, it will allow
some subsystems, whose PM callbacks don't do anything except for
executing driver callbacks, to be simplified quite a bit by removing
those "forward-only" callbacks.  Finally, it will allow us to remove
one level of indirection in the system suspend and resume code paths
where it is not necessary, which is going to lead to less debug noise
with initcall_debug passed in the kernel command line (messages won't
be printed for driverless devices whose subsystems don't provide
PM callbacks among other things).
