[S390] Add VMCOREINFO_SYMBOL(high_memory) to vmcoreinfo

Currently the vmalloc_start address (or better end of real memory) for s390x
is obtained by makedumpfile using vmlist.addr symbol, which is not correct.
The correct vmalloc_start address can be obtained using 'high_memory' symbol.

This patch adds the high_memory symbol to vmcoreinfo.
