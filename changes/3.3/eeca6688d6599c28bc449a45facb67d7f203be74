net_sched: red: split red_parms into parms and vars

This patch splits the red_parms structure into two components.

One holding the RED 'constant' parameters, and one containing the
variables.

This permits a size reduction of GRED qdisc, and is a preliminary step
to add an optional RED unit to SFQ.

SFQRED will have a single red_parms structure shared by all flows, and a
private red_vars per flow.
