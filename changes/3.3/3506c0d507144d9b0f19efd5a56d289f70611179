DMA: PL330: Remove pm_runtime_xxx calls from pl330 probe/remove

amba_probe() now calls pm_runtime_get_noresume() and pm_runtime_enable()
for the devices before the device probe is called. Hence we don't need
to call pm_runtime_get_xxx and pm_runtime_enable() in device probe again.
In the same way, since amba_remove() calls the respective pm_runtime
functions, those functions need not be called from device remove.

This patch fixes following run time error with pl330 driver.

dma-pl330 dma-pl330.0: Unbalanced pm_runtime_enable!
dma-pl330 dma-pl330.0: failed to get runtime pm
