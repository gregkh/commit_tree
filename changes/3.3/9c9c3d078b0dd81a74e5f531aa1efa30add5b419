[media] cx23885: Configure the MPEG encoder early to avoid jerky video

Found an odd bug while implementing support for the HVR1850 that
lead to jerky video during the first capture, if the encoder was
not initialized early. I've modied the driver to configure the
encoder early, and this avoids the issue - a reasonable workaround.

Regression tested against the HVR1800 and soon to be added HVR1850
