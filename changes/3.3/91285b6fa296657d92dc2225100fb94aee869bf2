ARM: OMAP: PRCM: add suspend prepare / finish support

PRCM chain handler needs to disable forwarding of interrupts during
suspend, because runtime PM is disabled and most of the drivers
are potentially not able to handle interrupts coming at this time.

This patch masks all the PRCM interrupt events if a PRCM interrupt
occurs during suspend, but does not ack them. Once suspend finish
is called, all the masked events will be re-enabled, which causes
immediate PRCM interrupt and handles the postponed event.

The suspend prepare and complete  callbacks will be called from
pm34xx.c / pm44xx.c files in the following patches.

The functions defined in this patch should eventually be moved to
suspend->prepare and suspend->finish driver hooks, once the PRCM
chain handler will be made as its own driver.
