ALSA: hda - Integrate input-jack stuff into kctl-jack

Instead of managing input-jack stuff separately, call all stuff inside
the kctl-jack creation, deletion and report.  The caller no longer needs
to care about input-jack.

The better integration between input-jack and kctl-jack should be done
in the upper layer in near future, but for now, it's implemented locally
for more tests.
