Input: convert obsolete strict_strtox to kstrtox

With commit 67d0a0754455f89ef3946946159d8ec9e45ce33a we mark strict_strtox
as obsolete. Convert all remaining such uses in drivers/input/.

Also change long to appropriate types, and return error conditions
from kstrtox separately, as Dmitry sugguests.
