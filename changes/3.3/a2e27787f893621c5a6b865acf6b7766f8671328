PCI: Introduce INTx check & mask API

These new PCI services allow to probe for 2.3-compliant INTx masking
support and then use the feature from PCI interrupt handlers. The
services are properly synchronized with concurrent config space access
via sysfs or on device reset.

This enables generic PCI device drivers like uio_pci_generic or KVM's
device assignment to implement the necessary kernel-side IRQ handling
without any knowledge about device-specific interrupt status and control
registers.
