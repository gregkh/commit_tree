Bluetooth: Move EIR and CoD update functions to a better position

Due to the upcoming addition of a service cache timer the functions to
update the EIR and CoD need to be higher up in mgmt.c in order to avoid
unnecessary forward-declarations. This patch simply moves code around
without any other changes in order to make subsequent patches more
readable.
