Fix autofs compile without CONFIG_COMPAT

The autofs compat handling fix caused a compile failure when
CONFIG_COMPAT isn't defined.

Instead of adding random #ifdef'fery in autofs, let's just make the
compat helpers earlier to use: without CONFIG_COMPAT, is_compat_task()
just hardcodes to zero.

We could probably do something similar for a number of other cases where
we have #ifdef's in code, but this is the low-hanging fruit.
