checkpatch: update signature "might be better as" warning

email header lines can look like signature tags.  It's valid to have
multiple email recipients on a single line but not valid to have multiple
signatures on a single line.

Validate signatures only when not in the email headers.

Clear the $in_commit_log flag when the patch filename appears.

Add '-' to the valid chars in a message header for headers
like "Message-Id:" and "In-Reply-To:".
