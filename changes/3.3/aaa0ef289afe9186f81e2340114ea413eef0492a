usb: PS3 EHCI QH read work-around

PS3 EHCI HC errata fix 244.  The SCC EHCI HC will not correctly perform QH
reads that occur near or span a micro-frame boundry.  This is due to a problem
in the Nak Count Reload Control logic (EHCI Specification 1.0 Section 4.9.1).

The work-around for this problem is for the HC driver to set I=1 (inactive) for
QHs with H=1 (list head).
