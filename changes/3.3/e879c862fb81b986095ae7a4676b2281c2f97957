ARM: restart: only perform setup for restart when soft-restarting

We only need to set the system up for a soft-restart if we're going to
be doing a soft-restart.  Provide a new function (soft_restart()) which
does the setup and final call for this, and make platforms use it.
Eliminate the call to setup_restart() from the default handler.

This means that platforms arch_reset() function is no longer called with
the page tables prepared for a soft-restart, and caches will still be
enabled.
