cgroup: don't use subsys->can_attach_task() or ->attach_task()

Now that subsys->can_attach() and attach() take @tset instead of
@task, they can handle per-task operations.  Convert
->can_attach_task() and ->attach_task() users to use ->can_attach()
and attach() instead.  Most converions are straight-forward.
Noteworthy changes are,

* In cgroup_freezer, remove unnecessary NULL assignments to unused
  methods.  It's useless and very prone to get out of sync, which
  already happened.

* In cpuset, PF_THREAD_BOUND test is checked for each task.  This
  doesn't make any practical difference but is conceptually cleaner.
