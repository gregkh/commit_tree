kprobes: return proper error code from register_kprobe()

register_kprobe() aborts if the address of the new request falls in a
prohibited area (such as ftrace pouch, __kprobes annotated functions,
non-kernel text addresses, jump label text).  We however don't return the
right error on this abort, resulting in a silent failure - incorrect
adding/reporting of kprobes ('perf probe do_fork+18' or 'perf probe
mcount' for instance).

In V2 we are incorporating Masami Hiramatsu's  feedback.

This patch fixes it by returning -EINVAL upon failure.

While we are here, rename the label used for exit to be more appropriate.
