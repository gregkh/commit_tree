Revert "CPU hotplug, cpusets, suspend: Don't touch cpusets during suspend/resume"

This reverts commit 8f2f748b0656257153bcf0941df8d6060acc5ca6.

It causes some odd regression that we have not figured out, and it's too
late in the -rc series to try to figure it out now.

As reported by Konstantin Khlebnikov, it causes consistent hangs on his
laptop (Thinkpad x220: 2x cores + HT).  They can be avoided by adding
calls to "rebuild_sched_domains();" in cpuset_cpu_[in]active() for the
CPU_{ONLINE/DOWN_FAILED/DOWN_PREPARE}_FROZEN cases, but it's not at all
clear why, and it makes no sense.

Konstantin's config doesn't even have CONFIG_CPUSETS enabled, just to
make things even more interesting.  So it's not the cpusets, it's just
the scheduling domains.

So until this is understood, revert.
