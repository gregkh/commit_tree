ACPI, x86: Use SRAT table rev to use 8bit or 32bit PXM fields (x86/x86-64)

In SRAT v1, we had 8bit proximity domain (PXM) fields; SRAT v2 provides
32bits for these. The new fields were reserved before.
According to the ACPI spec, the OS must disregrard reserved fields.

x86/x86-64 was rather inconsistent prior to this patch; it used 8 bits
for the pxm field in cpu_affinity, but 32 bits in mem_affinity.
This patch makes it consistent: Either use 8 bits consistently (SRAT
rev 1 or lower) or 32 bits (SRAT rev 2 or higher).
