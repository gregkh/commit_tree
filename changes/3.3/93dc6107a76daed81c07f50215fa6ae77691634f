Don't limit non-nested epoll paths

Commit 28d82dc1c4ed ("epoll: limit paths") that I did to limit the
number of possible wakeup paths in epoll is causing a few applications
to longer work (dovecot for one).

The original patch is really about limiting the amount of epoll nesting
(since epoll fds can be attached to other fds). Thus, we probably can
allow an unlimited number of paths of depth 1. My current patch limits
it at 1000. And enforce the limits on paths that have a greater depth.
