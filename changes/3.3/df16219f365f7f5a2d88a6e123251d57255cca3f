mmc: debugfs: expose the SDCLK frq in sys ios

This patch is to expose the actual SDCLK frequency in
/sys/kernel/debug/mmcX/ios entry.

For example, if the max clk for a normal speed card is 20MHz this
is reported in /sys/kernel/debug/mmcX/ios.  Unfortunately the actual
SDCLK frequency (i.e. Baseclock / divisor) is not reported at all:
for example, in that case, on Arasan HC, it should be 48/4=12 (MHz).
