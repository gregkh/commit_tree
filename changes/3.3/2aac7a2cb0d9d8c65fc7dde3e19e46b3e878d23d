unix_diag: Pending connections IDs NLA

When establishing a unix connection on stream sockets the
server end receives an skb with socket in its receive queue.

Report who is waiting for these ends to be accepted for
listening sockets via NLA.

There's a lokcing issue with this -- the unix sk state lock is
required to access the peer, and it is taken under the listening
sk's queue lock. Strictly speaking the queue lock should be taken
inside the state lock, but since in this case these two sockets
are different it shouldn't lead to deadlock.
