OMAPDSS: APPLY: fix extra_info_update_ongoing

extra_info_update_ongoing() skipped checks for overlays that were marked
as disabled. This doesn't work, as the enable status of an overlay is in
the extra_info group, and thus extra_info_update_ongoing() reports false
when we are disabling an overlay. This causes
wait_pending_extra_info_updates() to not wait for the ongoing overlay
disable.

This patch changes extra_info_update_ongoing() to check the state of
overlays marked as disabled.
