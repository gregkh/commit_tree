sched/accounting: Fix user/system tick double accounting

Now that we're  pointing cpuacct's root cgroup to cpustat and accounting
through task_group_account_field(), we should not access cpustat directly.
Since it is done anyway inside the acessor function, we end up accounting
it twice, which is wrong.
