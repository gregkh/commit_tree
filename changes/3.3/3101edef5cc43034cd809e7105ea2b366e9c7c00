ath6kl: fix missing copy of action frame contents

The wpa_supplicant was receiving incorrect frame contents in the
callback function that indicates the status of the frame transmitted.
This patch fixes a missing copy of the frame contents to a local
buffer. The local buffer keeps track of the last sent management frame.
