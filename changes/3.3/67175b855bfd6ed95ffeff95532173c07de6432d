Fix compile breakage with kref.h

This set of build failures just started appearing on parisc:

  In file included from drivers/input/serio/serio_raw.c:12:
  include/linux/kref.h: In function 'kref_get':
  include/linux/kref.h:40: error: 'TAINT_WARN' undeclared (first use in this function)
  include/linux/kref.h:40: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
  include/linux/kref.h:40: error: for each function it appears in.)
  include/linux/kref.h: In function 'kref_sub':
  include/linux/kref.h:65: error: 'TAINT_WARN' undeclared (first use in this function)

It happens because TAINT_WARN is defined in kernel.h and this particular
compile doesn't seem to include it (no idea why it's just manifesting ..
probably some #include file untangling exposed it).

Fix by adding

  #include <linux/kernel.h>

to linux/kref.h
