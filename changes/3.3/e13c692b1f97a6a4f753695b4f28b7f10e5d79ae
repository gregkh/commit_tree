ARM: davinci: vpif: move code to driver core header from platform

Move vpif related definitions for capture and display drivers
from dm646x platform header file to vpif_types.h inside
the driver as these definitions are related to driver code
rather than the platform or board.

This enables reusing this IP across platforms.
