Input: evdev - only allow reading events if a full packet is present

Without this, it was possible for the reader to get ahead of packet_head.
If the input device generated a partial packet *right* after the reader
got ahead, then we can get into a situation where the device is marked
readable, but read always returns 0 until the next packet is finished
(i.e a SYN is generated by the input driver).

This situation can also happen if we overflow the buffer while a reader
is trying to read an event out.
