Revert "mtd: atmel_nand: optimize read/write buffer functions"

This reverts commit fb5427508abbd635e877fabdf55795488119c2d6.

The reason is that it breaks 16 bits NAND flash as it was reported by
Nikolaus Voss and confirmed by Eric BÃ©nard.

Nicolas Ferre <nicolas.ferre@atmel.com> alco confirmed:
"After double checking with designers, I must admit that I misunderstood
the way of optimizing accesses to SMC. 16 bit nand is not so common
those days..."
