block: remove elevator_queue->ops

elevator_queue->ops points to the same ops struct ->elevator_type.ops
is pointing to.  The only effect of caching it in elevator_queue is
shorter notation - it doesn't save any indirect derefence.

Relocate elevator_type->list which used only during module init/exit
to the end of the structure, rename elevator_queue->elevator_type to
->type, and replace elevator_queue->ops with elevator_queue->type.ops.

This doesn't introduce any functional difference.
