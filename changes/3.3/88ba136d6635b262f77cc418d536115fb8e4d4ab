netfilter: ebtables: fix alignment problem in ppc

ebt_among extension of ebtables uses __alignof__(_xt_align) while the
corresponding kernel module uses __alignof__(ebt_replace) to determine
the alignment in EBT_ALIGN().

These are the results of these values on different platforms:

x86 x86_64 ppc
__alignof__(_xt_align) 4 8 8
__alignof__(ebt_replace) 4 8 4

ebtables fails to add rules which use the among extension.

I'm using kernel 2.6.33 and ebtables 2.0.10-4

According to Bart De Schuymer, userspace alignment was changed to
_xt_align to fix an alignment issue on a userspace32-kernel64 system
(he thinks it was for an ARM device). So userspace must be right.
The kernel alignment macro needs to change so it also uses _xt_align
instead of ebt_replace. The userspace changes date back from
June 29, 2009.
