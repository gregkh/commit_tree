PM: Fix indentation and remove extraneous whitespaces in kernel/power/main.c

Lack of proper indentation of the goto statement decreases the readability
of code significantly. In fact, this made me look twice at the code to check
whether it really does what it should be doing. Fix this.

And in the same file, there are some extra whitespaces. Get rid of them too.
