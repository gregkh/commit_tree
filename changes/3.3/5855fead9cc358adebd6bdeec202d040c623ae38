ftrace: Use bsearch to find record ip

Now that each set of pages in the function list are sorted by
ip, we can use bsearch to find a record within each set of pages.
This speeds up the ftrace_location() function by magnitudes.

For archs (like x86) that need to add a breakpoint at every function
that will be converted from a nop to a callback and vice versa,
the breakpoint callback needs to know if the breakpoint was for
ftrace or not. It requires finding the breakpoint ip within the
records. Doing a linear search is extremely inefficient. It is
a must to be able to do a fast binary search to find these locations.
