target: Add workaround for zero-length control CDB handling

This patch adds a work-around for handling zero allocation length
control CDBs (type SCF_SCSI_CONTROL_SG_IO_CDB) that was causing an
OOPs with the following raw calls:

   # sg_raw -v /dev/sdd 3 0 0 0 0 0
   # sg_raw -v /dev/sdd 0x1a 0 1 0 0 0

This patch will follow existing zero-length handling for data I/O
and silently return with GOOD status.  This addresses the zero length
issue, but the proper long-term resolution for handling arbitary
allocation lengths will be to refactor out data-phase handling in
individual CDB emulation logic within target_core_cdb.c
