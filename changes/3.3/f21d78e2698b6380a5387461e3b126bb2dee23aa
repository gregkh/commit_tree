ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid conflict of unsol-events with static quirks

The recently added jack-kctl support sets the unsol event tags
dynamically, while static quirks usually set the fixed tags in the
init_verbs array.  Due to this conflict, the own unsol event handler
can't retrieve the tag and handle it properly any more.

For fixing this, avoid calling snd_hda_jack_add_kctls() for static
quirks, and always let them use own handlers instead of the standard
one for the auto-pareser.
