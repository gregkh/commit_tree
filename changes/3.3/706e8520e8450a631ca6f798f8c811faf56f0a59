pinctrl: correct a offset while enumerating pins

This patch modifies a offset while enumerating pins to support a
partial pin space. If we use a pin number for enumerating pins,
the pin space always starts with zero base. Indeed, we always check
the pin is in the pin space. An extreme example, there is only two pins.
One is 0. Another is 1000. We always enumerate whole offsets until 1000.
For solving this problem, we use the offset of the pin array instead
of the zero-based pin number.
