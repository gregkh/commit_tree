[S390] fix cputime overflow in uptime_proc_show

For 32-bit architectures using standard jiffies the idletime calculation
in uptime_proc_show will quickly overflow. It takes (2^32 / HZ) seconds
of idle-time, or e.g. 12.45 days with no load on a quad-core with HZ=1000.
Switch to 64-bit calculations.
