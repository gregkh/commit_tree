C6X: memory management and DMA support

Original port to early 2.6 kernel using TI COFF toolchain.
Brought up to date by Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com>

The C6X architecture currently lacks an MMU so memory management is relatively
simple. There is no bus snooping between L2 and main memory but coherent DMA
memory is supported by making regions of main memory uncached. If such a region
is desired, it can be specified on the commandline with a "memdma=" argument.
