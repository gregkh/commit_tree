MAINTAINERS: update ST's Mailing list for SPEAr

We have created a ST's Mailing list for SPEAr.  This can be accessed
from non-st email ids.  I want people to cc this list, when they have
changes specific to SPEAr.  So, its better to get this updated in
MAINTAINERS file.

linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org is also added for SPEAr.
