acpi/apei/einj: Add extensions to EINJ from rev 5.0 of acpi spec

ACPI 5.0 provides extensions to the EINJ mechanism to specify the
target for the error injection - by APICID for cpu related errors,
by address for memory related errors, and by segment/bus/device/function
for PCIe related errors. Also extensions for vendor specific error
injections.
