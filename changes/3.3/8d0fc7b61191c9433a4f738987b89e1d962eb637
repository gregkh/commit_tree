mlx4_core: Changing link sensing logic

New FW can give clues to driver regarding default port type
and whether or not we should default to link sensing on the port.

2 bits are added to QUERY_PORT command:
1. suggested_type: This bit gives a hint whether the default port type should be
   IB or Ethernet.
   The driver will use this hint in case the user didn't specify explicitly the link layer
   type he wants to set.
2. default_sense: If this bit is set, we would sense the port type on start-up
   and default the port to link sensing
