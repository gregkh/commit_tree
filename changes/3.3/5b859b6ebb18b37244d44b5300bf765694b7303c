crypto: talitos - be less noisy on startup

talitos prints every algorithm it registers at module load time.
Algorithms are being added that make for an excessively noisy console
(latest HMACs patch makes an SEC 3.1 print 20 lines).
Instead, display the SEC h/w version number, and inform the
user of algorithm registration status in /proc/crypto, like so:

talitos ffe30000.crypto: fsl,sec3.1 algorithms registered in /proc/crypto
