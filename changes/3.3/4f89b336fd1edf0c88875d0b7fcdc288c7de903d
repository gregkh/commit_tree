rcu: Apply ACCESS_ONCE() to rcu_boost() return value

Both TINY_RCU's and TREE_RCU's implementations of rcu_boost() access
the ->boost_tasks and ->exp_tasks fields without preventing concurrent
changes to these fields.  This commit therefore applies ACCESS_ONCE in
order to prevent compiler mischief.
