quota: Fix deadlock with suspend and quotas

This script causes a kernel deadlock:
set -e
DEVICE=/dev/vg1/linear
lvchange -ay $DEVICE
mkfs.ext3 $DEVICE
mount -t ext3 -o usrquota,grpquota $DEVICE /mnt/test
quotacheck -gu /mnt/test
umount /mnt/test
mount -t ext3 -o usrquota,grpquota $DEVICE /mnt/test
quotaon /mnt/test
dmsetup suspend $DEVICE
setquota -u root 1 2 3 4 /mnt/test &
sleep 1
dmsetup resume $DEVICE

setquota acquired semaphore s_umount for read and then tried to perform a
transaction (and waits because the device is suspended).  dmsetup resume tries
to acquire s_umount for write before resuming the device (and waits for
setquota).

Fix the deadlock by grabbing a thawed superblock for quota commands which need
it.
