ARM: OMAP: Add Secure HAL and monitor mode API infrastructure.

On OMAP secure/emulation devices, certain APIs are exported by secure
code. Add an infrastructure so that relevant operations on secure
devices can be implemented using it.

While at this, rename omap44xx-smc.S to omap-smc.S since the common APIs
can be used on other OMAP's too.
