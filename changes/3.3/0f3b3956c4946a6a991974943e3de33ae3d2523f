mips: use the the PCI controller's io_map_base

commit eab90291d35438bcebf7c3dc85be66d0f24e3002
(mips: switch to GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP)
failed to take into account the PCI controller's
io_map_base for mapping IO BARs.
This also caused a new warning on mips.

Fix this, without re-introducing code duplication,
by setting NO_GENERIC_PCI_IOPORT_MAP
and supplying a mips-specific __pci_ioport_map.
