ARM: 7277/1: setup.c: Fix build warning by removing unneeded header file

Fix the following build warning:

  CC      arch/arm/kernel/setup.o
In file included from arch/arm/kernel/setup.c:39:
arch/arm/include/asm/elf.h:102:1: warning: "vmcore_elf64_check_arch" redefined
In file included from arch/arm/kernel/setup.c:24:
include/linux/crash_dump.h:30:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition

Since commit 93a72052 (crash_dump: export is_kdump_kernel to modules, consolidate elfcorehdr_addr, setup_elfcorehdr and saved_max_pfn)
the inclusion of <linux/crash_dump.h> is no longer needed.

Remove the inclusion of <linux/crash_dump.h> and the build warning is fixed.
