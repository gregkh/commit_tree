powerpc/xics: Harden xics hypervisor backend

During kdump stress testing I sometimes see the kdump kernel panic
with:

  Interrupt 0x306 (real) is invalid, disabling it.
  Kernel panic - not syncing: bad return code EOI - rc = -4, value=ff000306

Instead of panicing print the error message, dump the stack the first
time it happens and continue on. Add some more information to the
debug messages as well.
