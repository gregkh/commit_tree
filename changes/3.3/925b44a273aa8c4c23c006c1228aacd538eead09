PM / Domains: Provide an always on power domain governor

Since systems are likely to have power domains that can't be turned off
for various reasons at least temporarily while implementing power domain
support provide a default governor which will always refuse to power off
the domain, saving platforms having to implement their own.

Since the code is so tiny don't bother with a Kconfig symbol for it.
