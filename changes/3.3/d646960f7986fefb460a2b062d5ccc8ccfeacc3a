NFC: Initial LLCP support

This patch is an initial implementation for the NFC Logical Link Control
protocol. It's also known as NFC peer to peer mode.
This is a basic implementation as it lacks SDP (services Discovery
Protocol), frames aggregation support, and frame rejecion parsing.
Follow up patches will implement those missing features.
This code has been tested against a Nexus S phone implementing LLCP 1.0.
