mm: compaction: make isolate_lru_page() filter-aware again

Commit 39deaf85 ("mm: compaction: make isolate_lru_page() filter-aware")
noted that compaction does not migrate dirty or writeback pages and that
is was meaningless to pick the page and re-add it to the LRU list.  This
had to be partially reverted because some dirty pages can be migrated by
compaction without blocking.

This patch updates "mm: compaction: make isolate_lru_page" by skipping
over pages that migration has no possibility of migrating to minimise LRU
disruption.
