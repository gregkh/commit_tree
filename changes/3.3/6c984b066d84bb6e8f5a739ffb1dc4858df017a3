ARM: OMAP: USBHOST: Replace usbhs core driver APIs by Runtime pm APIs

The ehci and ohci drivers does not use the APIs of the usbhs
core driver; the runtime pm APIs are used for clock
enable/disable. Since usbhs is parent platform device of the
ehci and ohci devices, the runtime apis indirectly uses the
usb hs core device as input parameter to for clock functions.
