IB/uverbs: Protect QP multicast list

Userspace verbs multicast attach/detach operations on a QP are done
while holding the rwsem of the QP for reading.  That's not sufficient
since a reader lock allows more than one reader to acquire the
lock.  However, multicast attach/detach does list manipulation that
can corrupt the list if multiple threads run in parallel.

Fix this by acquiring the rwsem as a writer to serialize attach/detach
operations.  Add idr_write_qp() and put_qp_write() to encapsulate
this.

This fixes oops seen when running applications that perform multicast
joins/leaves.
