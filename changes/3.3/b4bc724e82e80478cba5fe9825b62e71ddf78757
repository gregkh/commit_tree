genirq: Handle pending irqs in irq_startup()

An interrupt might be pending when irq_startup() is called, but the
startup code does not invoke the resend logic. In some cases this
prevents the device from issuing another interrupt which renders the
device non functional.

Call the resend function in irq_startup() to keep things going.
