ARM: OMAP4: PM: Use custom omap_do_wfi() for default idle.

Default arch_idle() isn't good enough for OMAP4 because of aync bridge errata
and necessity of NOPs post WFI to avoid speculative prefetch aborts.
Hence Use OMAP4 custom omap_do_wfi() hook for default idle.

Later in the series, async bridge errata work-around patch updates the
omap_do_wfi() with necessary interconnects barriers.
