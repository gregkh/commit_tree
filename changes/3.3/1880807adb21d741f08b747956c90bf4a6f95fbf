target: make the se_task task_state_active a normal bool

There is no need to make task_state_active an atomic_t given that it is
always set under the execute_task_lock so we can make it a simple bool.
Also rename it to t_state_active to be closer to the list it guards,
and make sure all checks before the list addion/removal actually happen
under execute_task_lock.
