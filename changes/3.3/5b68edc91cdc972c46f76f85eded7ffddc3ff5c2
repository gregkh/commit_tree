x86/microcode_amd: Add support for CPU family specific container files

We've decided to provide CPU family specific container files
(starting with CPU family 15h). E.g. for family 15h we have to
load microcode_amd_fam15h.bin instead of microcode_amd.bin

Rationale is that starting with family 15h patch size is larger
than 2KB which was hard coded as maximum patch size in various
microcode loaders (not just Linux).

Container files which include patches larger than 2KB cause
different kinds of trouble with such old patch loaders. Thus we
have to ensure that the default container file provides only
patches with size less than 2KB.
