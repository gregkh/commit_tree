Staging: bcm: Reverse semaphore locking in IOCTL_BCM_BUFFER_DOWNLOAD_STOP.

This patch reorders the semaphore locking.
It makes better sense to first evaluate
fw_download_sema semaphore then
NVMRdmWrmLocl semaphore. The
fw_download_sema is suppose to be
acquired in the START ioctl.  If this is
not true, then it does not make sense
to continue.
