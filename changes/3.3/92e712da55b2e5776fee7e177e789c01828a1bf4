wl12xx: fix checking of started dev role

dev_role_id only indicates whether the dev role
is enabled, not started (e.g. on IBSS merge,
the device role is enabled, but not started).

Checking for any role in ROC (in order to determine
whether dev role was started) is wrong as well,
especially in multi-vif env.

Check for started dev role only by checking the dev_hlid.
