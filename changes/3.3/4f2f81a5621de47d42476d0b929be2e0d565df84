x86, syscall: Need __ARCH_WANT_SYS_IPC for 32 bits

In checkin

  303395ac3bf3 x86: Generate system call tables and unistd_*.h from tables

the feature macros in <asm/unistd.h> were unified between 32 and 64
bits.  Unfortunately 32 bits requires __ARCH_WANT_SYS_IPC and this was
inadvertently dropped.
