Staging: bcm: Alter code to move error handling closer to the calls; and remove white space, IOCTL_BCM_NVM_WRITE.

This is a clean up patch for IOCTL_BCM_NVM_WRITE
that replaces the assignment of the Status
variable with direct returns of the error code,
replaces the break statements with direct returns,
and removes a white space.
