ALSA: hda/realtek - Create multi-io jacks more aggresively

So far the driver creates the multi-io jacks only when a single output
jack, i.e. no multiple speakers are assigned.  This patch adds the
similar multi-io detection even with multiple speakers are assigned
primarily, so that 5.1-speakers + HP/mic/LI combination can work.
