[media] uvcvideo: Don't skip erroneous payloads

Instead of skipping the payload completely, which would make the
resulting image corrupted anyway, store the payload normally and mark
the buffer as erroneous. If the no_drop module parameter is set to 1 the
buffer will then be passed to userspace, and tt will then be up to the
application to decide what to do with the buffer.
