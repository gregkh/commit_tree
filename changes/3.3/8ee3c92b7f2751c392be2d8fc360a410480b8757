ftrace: Remove force undef config value left for testing

A forced undef of a config value was used for testing and was
accidently left in during the final commit. This causes x86 to
run slower than needed while running function tracing as well
as causes the function graph selftest to fail when DYNMAIC_FTRACE
is not set. This is because the code in MCOUNT expects the ftrace
code to be processed with the config value set that happened to
be forced not set.

The forced config option was left in by:
