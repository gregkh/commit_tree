ftrace: Create ftrace_hash_empty() helper routine

There are two types of hashes in the ftrace_ops; one type
is the filter_hash and the other is the notrace_hash. Either
one may be null, meaning it has no elements. But when elements
are added, the hash is allocated.

Throughout the code, a check needs to be made to see if a hash
exists or the hash has elements, but the check if the hash exists
is usually missing causing the possible "NULL pointer dereference bug".

Add a helper routine called "ftrace_hash_empty()" that returns
true if the hash doesn't exist or its count is zero. As they mean
the same thing.
