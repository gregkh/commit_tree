md/raid10:  Handle replacement devices during resync.

If we need to resync an array which has replacement devices,
we always write any block checked to every replacement.

If the resync was bitmap-based resync we will then complete the
replacement normally.
If it was a full resync, we mark the replacements as fully recovered
when the resync finishes so no further recovery is needed.
