drivers:misc: ti-st: DEBUG uart, baud rate mods

To debug different UARTs at different baud-rates connected to the WiLink
connectivity combo-chipset, this patch enables the debugging code so that upon
boot different UARTs at different baud-rates can be tried out to verify the
interface with WiLink.
