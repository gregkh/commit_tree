NVMe: Handle failures from memory allocations in nvme_setup_prps

If any of the memory allocations in nvme_setup_prps fail, handle it by
modifying the passed-in data length to reflect the number of bytes we are
actually able to send.  Also allow the caller to specify the GFP flags
they need; for user-initiated commands, we can use GFP_KERNEL allocations.

The various callers are updated to handle this possibility; the main
I/O path is already prepared for this possibility (as it may happen
due to nvme_map_bio being unable to map all the segments of the I/O).
The other callers return -ENOMEM instead of doing partial I/Os.
