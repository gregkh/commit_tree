tipc: Ignore neighbor discovery messages containing invalid address

Adds a check to ensure that TIPC ignores an incoming neighbor discovery
message that specifies an invalid media address as its source. The check
ensures that the source address is a valid, non-broadcast address that
could legally be used by a neighboring link endpoint.
