ixgbe: DCBnl set_all, order of operations fix

The order of operations is important in DCBnl set_all(). When FCoE
is configured it uses the up2tc map to learn which queues to configure
the hardware offloads on. Therefore we need to setup the map before
configuring FCoE.

This is only seen when the both up2tc mappings and APP info are
configured simultaneously.
