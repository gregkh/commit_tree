i387: fix sense of sanity check

The check for save_init_fpu() (introduced in commit 5b1cbac37798: "i387:
make irq_fpu_usable() tests more robust") was the wrong way around, but
I hadn't noticed, because my "tests" were bogus: the FPU exceptions are
disabled by default, so even doing a divide by zero never actually
triggers this code at all unless you do extra work to enable them.

So if anybody did enable them, they'd get one spurious warning.
