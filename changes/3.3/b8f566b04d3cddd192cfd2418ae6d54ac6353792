sysctl: add the kernel.ns_last_pid control

The sysctl works on the current task's pid namespace, getting and setting
its last_pid field.

Writing is allowed for CAP_SYS_ADMIN-capable tasks thus making it possible
to create a task with desired pid value.  This ability is required badly
for the checkpoint/restore in userspace.

This approach suits all the parties for now.
