powerpc/cpuidle: Enable cpuidle and directly call cpuidle_idle_call() for pSeries

This patch enables cpuidle for pSeries and pSeries_idle is
directly called from the idle loop. As a result of pSeries_idle, cpuidle
driver registered with cpuidle subsystem comes into action. On
failure of loading of the driver or cpuidle framework default idle
is executed as part of the function. This patch
also removes the routines pseries_shared_idle_sleep and
pseries_dedicated_idle_sleep as they are now implemented as part of
pseries_idle cpuidle driver.
