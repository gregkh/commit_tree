ALSA: hda - Fix silent outputs from docking-station jacks of Dell laptops

The recent change of the power-widget handling for IDT codecs caused
the silent output from the docking-station line-out jack.  This was
partially fixed by the commit f2cbba7602383cd9cdd21f0a5d0b8bd1aad47b33
"ALSA: hda - Fix the lost power-setup of seconary pins after PM resume".
But the line-out on the docking-station is still silent when booted
with the jack plugged even by this fix.

The remainig bug is that the power-widget is set off in stac92xx_init()
because the pins in cfg->line_out_pins[] aren't checked there properly
but only hp_pins[] are checked in is_nid_hp_pin().

This patch fixes the problem by checking both HP and line-out pins
and leaving the power-map correctly.
