m68k: ColdFire with MMU enabled uses same clocking code as non-MMU

We want to use the same timer support code for ColdFire CPU's when
running with MMU enabled or not. So use the same time_no.c code even
when the MMU is enabled for ColdFire. This also means we do not want
CONFIG_ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET set, since that code is only in time_mm.c.
