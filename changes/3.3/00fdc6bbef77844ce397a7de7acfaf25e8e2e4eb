iscsi-target: Fix reservation conflict -EBUSY response handling bug

This patch addresses a iscsi-target specific bug related to reservation conflict
handling in iscsit_handle_scsi_cmd() that has been causing reservation conflicts
to complete and not fail as expected due to incorrect errno checking.  The problem
occured with the change to return -EBUSY from transport_generic_cmd_sequencer() ->
transport_generic_allocate_tasks() failures, that broke iscsit_handle_scsi_cmd()
checking for -EINVAL in order to invoke a non GOOD status response.

This was manifesting itself as data corruption with legacy SPC-2 reservations,
but also effects iscsi-target LUNs with SPC-3 persistent reservations.

This bug was originally introduced in lio-core commit:
