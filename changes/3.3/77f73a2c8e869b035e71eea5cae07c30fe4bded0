ARM: LPAE: mark memory banks with start > ULONG_MAX as highmem

Memory banks living outside of the 32-bit physical address
space do not have a 1:1 pa <-> va mapping and therefore the
__va macro may wrap.

This patch ensures that such banks are marked as highmem so
that the Kernel doesn't try to split them up when it sees that
the wrapped virtual address overlaps the vmalloc space.
