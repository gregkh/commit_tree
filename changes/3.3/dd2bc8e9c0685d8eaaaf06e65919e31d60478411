bnx2: switch to build_skb() infrastructure

This is very similar to bnx2x conversion, but bnx2 only requires 16bytes
alignement at start of the received frame to store its l2_fhdr, so goal
was not to reduce skb truesize (in fact it should not change after this
patch)

Using build_skb() reduces cache line misses in the driver, since we
use cache hot skb instead of cold ones. Number of in-flight sk_buff
structures is lower, they are more likely recycled in SLUB caches
while still hot.
