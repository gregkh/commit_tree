staging: tidspbridge: fix incorrect free to drv_datap

This structure is still used after it has been freed, since it
is being allocated in probe, calls to free it have been moved to
module's remove routine.

This should fix the follwoing messages when attempting to remove the
module:
 drv_get_first_dev_extension: Failed to retrieve the object handle
 drv_get_first_dev_extension: Failed to retrieve the object handle
 drv_destroy: Failed to store DRV object
 mgr_destroy: Failed to store MGR object
