[SCSI] mpt2sas: Removed redundant calling of _scsih_probe_devices() from _scsih_probe

Removed redundant calling of _scsih_probe_devices() from _scsih_probe as
it is getting called from _scsih_scan_finished.

Also moved the function scsi_scan_host(shost) to get called after the
volumes on warp drive are reported to the OS. Otherwise by the time
the (ioc->hide_drives) flags is set, the volumes on warp drive
are reported to the OS already.

Also modified the initialization of reply queues only in case of driver load
time in the function _base_make_ioc_operational().
