kernel.h: add BUILD_BUG() macro

We can place this in definitions that we expect the compiler to remove by
dead code elimination.  If this assertion fails, we get a nice error
message at build time.

The GCC function attribute error("message") was added in version 4.3, so
we define a new macro __linktime_error(message) to expand to this for
GCC-4.3 and later.  This will give us an error diagnostic from the
compiler on the line that fails.  For other compilers
__linktime_error(message) expands to nothing, and we have to be content
with a link time error, but at least we will still get a build error.

BUILD_BUG() expands to the undefined function __build_bug_failed() and
will fail at link time if the compiler ever emits code for it.  On GCC-4.3
and later, attribute((error())) is used so that the failure will be noted
at compile time instead.
