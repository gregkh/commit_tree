net: Make qdisc_skb_cb upper size bound explicit.

Just like skb->cb[], so that qdisc_skb_cb can be encapsulated inside
of other data structures.

This is intended to be used by IPoIB so that it can remember
addressing information stored at hard_header_ops->create() time that
it can fetch when the packet gets to the transmit routine.
