btrfs: fix a deadlock in btrfs_scan_one_device()

pathname resolution under a global mutex, taken on some paths in ->mount()
is a Bad Idea(tm) - think what happens if said pathname resolution triggers
automount of some btrfs instance and walks into attempt to grab the same
mutex.  Deadlock - we are waiting for daemon to finish walking the path,
daemon is waiting for us to release the mutex...
