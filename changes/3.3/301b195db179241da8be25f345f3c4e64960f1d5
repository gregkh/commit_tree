perf evlist: Fix errno value reporting on failed mmap

On failure, perf_evlist__mmap_per_{cpu,thread} will try to munmap()
every map that doesn't have a NULL base. This will fail with EINVAL if
one of them has base == MAP_FAILED, clobbering errno, so that
perf_evlist__map will return EINVAL on any failure regardless of the
root cause.

Fix this by resetting failed maps to a NULL base.
