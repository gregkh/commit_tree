Btrfs: fix possible deadlock when opening a seed device

The correct lock order is uuid_mutex -> volume_mutex -> chunk_mutex,
but when we mount a filesystem which has backing seed devices, we have
this lock chain:

    open_ctree()
        lock(chunk_mutex);
        read_chunk_tree();
            read_one_dev();
                open_seed_devices();
                    lock(uuid_mutex);

and then we hit a lockdep splat.
