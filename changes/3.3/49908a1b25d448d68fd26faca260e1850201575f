perf: Fix parsing of __print_flags() in TP_printk()

A update is made to the sched:sched_switch event that adds some
logic to the first parameter of the __print_flags() that shows the
state of tasks. This change cause perf to fail parsing the flags.

A simple fix is needed to have the parser be able to process ops
within the argument.
