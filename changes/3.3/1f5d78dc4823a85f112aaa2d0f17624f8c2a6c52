UBIFS: make debugging messages light again

We switch to dynamic debugging in commit
56e46742e846e4de167dde0e1e1071ace1c882a5 but did not take into account that
now we do not control anymore whether a specific message is enabled or not.
So now we lock the "dbg_lock" and release it in every debugging macro, which
make them not so light-weight.

This commit removes the "dbg_lock" protection from the debugging macros to
fix the issue.

The downside is that now our DBGKEY() stuff is broken, but this is not
critical at all and will be fixed later.
