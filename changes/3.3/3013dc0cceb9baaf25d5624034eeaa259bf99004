3c59x: shorten timer period for slave devices

Jean Delvare reported bonding on top of 3c59x adapters was not detecting
network cable removal fast enough.

3c59x indeed uses a 60 seconds timer to check link status if carrier is
on, and 5 seconds if carrier is off.

This patch reduces timer period to 5 seconds if device is a bonding
slave.
