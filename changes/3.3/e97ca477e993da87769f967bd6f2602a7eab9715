ARM: OMAP4: PM: CPU1 wakeup workaround from Low power modes

The SGI(Software Generated Interrupts) are not wakeup capable from
low power states. This is known limitation on OMAP4 and needs to be
worked around by using software forced clockdomain wake-up. CPU0 forces
the CPU1 clockdomain to software force wakeup.

More details can be found in OMAP4430 TRM - Version J

	4.3.4.2 Power States of CPU0 and CPU1
