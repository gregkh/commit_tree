DMA: PL330: Infer transfer direction from transfer request instead of platform data

The transfer direction for a channel can be inferred from the transfer
request and the need for specifying transfer direction in platfrom data
can be eliminated. So the structure definition 'struct dma_pl330_peri'
is no longer required.

The channel's private data is set to point to a channel id specified in
the platform data (instead of an instance of type 'struct dma_pl330_peri').
The filter function is correspondingly modified to match the channel id.

With the 'struct dma_pl330_peri' removed from platform data, the dma
controller transfer capabilities cannot be inferred any more. Hence,
the dma controller capabilities is specified using platform data.
