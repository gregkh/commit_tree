drm/radeon: Set DESKTOP_HEIGHT register to the framebuffer (not mode) height.

The value of this register is transferred to the V_COUNTER register at the
beginning of vertical blank. V_COUNTER is the reference for VLINE waits and
goes from VIEWPORT_Y_START to VIEWPORT_Y_START+VIEWPORT_HEIGHT during scanout,
so if VIEWPORT_Y_START is not 0, V_COUNTER actually went backwards at the
beginning of vertical blank, and VLINE waits excluding the whole scanout area
could never finish (possibly only if VIEWPORT_Y_START is larger than the length
of vertical blank in scanlines). Setting DESKTOP_HEIGHT to the framebuffer
height should prevent this for any kind of VLINE wait.
