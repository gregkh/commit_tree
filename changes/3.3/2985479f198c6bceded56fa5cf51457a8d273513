gpio: Explicitly index samsung_gpio_cfgs

Make it easier to follow the by number references into samsung_gpio_cfgs
by putting the indexes into the code initialising the array, improving
readability a bit. Ideally we wouldn't be using magic array indexes at all
but this is easier than coming up with a better way.
