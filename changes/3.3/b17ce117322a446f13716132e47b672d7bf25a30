ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Introduce driver data for audio codec

Under the new DSS architecture for HDMI, there is a clear separation
between general DSS code and HDMI IP-specific data. Functions
that require access to the HDMI driver IP-specific data receive an
hdmi_ip_data structure. The ASoC codec require access to such
IP-specific data. Then, instead of accessing it directly, it will be
passed as codec driver data. This also helps to have a clear separation
between DSS and ASoC portions of the code.
