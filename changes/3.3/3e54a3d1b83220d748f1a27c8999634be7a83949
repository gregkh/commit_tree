mtip32xx: uninitialized variable in mtip_quiesce_io()

We recently introduce new continue in the loop which make gcc complain.
In theory if MTIP_FLAG_SVC_THD_ACTIVE_BIT is set, we could hit continue
over and over until eventually we time out of the loop.  In that case
"active" should be set as true, but right now it's uninitialized.
