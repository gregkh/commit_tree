tun: don't hold network namespace by tun sockets

v3: added previously removed sock_put() to the tun_release() callback, because
sk_release_kernel() doesn't drop the socket reference.

v2: sk_release_kernel() used for socket release. Dummy tun_release() is
required for sk_release_kernel() ---> sock_release() ---> sock->ops->release()
call.

TUN was designed to destroy it's socket on network namesapce shutdown. But this
will never happen for persistent device, because it's socket holds network
namespace.
This patch removes of holding network namespace by TUN socket and replaces it
by creating socket in init_net and then changing it's net it to desired one. On
shutdown socket is moved back to init_net prior to final put.
