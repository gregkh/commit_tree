Btrfs: make avail_*_alloc_bits fields dynamic

Currently when new chunks are created respective avail_alloc_bits field
is updated to reflect profiles of all chunks present in the system.
However when chunks are removed profile bits are never cleared.

This patch clears profile bit of respective avail_alloc_bits field when
the last chunk with that profile is removed.  Restriper needs this to
properly operate when "downgrading".
