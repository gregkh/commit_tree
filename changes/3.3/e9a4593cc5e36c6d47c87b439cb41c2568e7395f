leds: add led driver for Bachmann's ot200

Add support for leds on Bachmann's ot200 visualisation device.  The
device has three leds on the back panel (led_err, led_init and led_run)
and can handle up to seven leds on the front panel.

The driver was written by Linutronix on behalf of Bachmann electronic
GmbH.  It incorporates feedback from Lars-Peter Clausen
