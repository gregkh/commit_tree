tcp: fix comment for tp->highest_sack

There was an off-by-one error in the comments describing the
highest_sack field in struct tcp_sock. The comments previously claimed
that it was the "start sequence of the highest skb with SACKed
bit". This commit fixes the comments to note that it is the "start
sequence of the skb just *after* the highest skb with SACKed bit".
