[SCSI] isci: allow more time for wide port targets

When hot insert the wide port device through the mini-sas port,
the first IOs (Report Luns or Inquiry) may fail due to the device
trying to open to a SCU phy that is still in suspended state. This
IO failure causes the wide port device stuck in UPDATING_PORT_WIDTH
state.
