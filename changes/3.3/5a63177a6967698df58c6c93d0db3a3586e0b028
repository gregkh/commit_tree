staging: tidspbridge: fix bridge_open memory leaks

There are two members of pr_ctxt allocated during bridge_open that
are never freed resulting in memory leaks, these are stream_id and
node_id, they are now freed on release of the handle (bridge_release)
right before freeing pr_ctxt.

Error path for bridge_open was also fixed since the same variables
could result in memory leaking due to missing handling of failure
scenarios. While at it, the indentation changes were introduced to
avoid interleaved goto statements inside big if blocks.
