btrfs: fix mount/umount race

Do *NOT* skip doomed superblocks in btrfs_test_super(); we want
sget() to wait for their shutdown to complete.  Since we don't
mutilate ->s_fs_info in ->put_super() anymore (or free what it
used to point to until the superblock is past being findable
by sget()), we can just DTRT there and report a match.
