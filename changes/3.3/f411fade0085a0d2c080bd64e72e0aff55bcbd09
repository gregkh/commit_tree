ARM: mach-shmobile: r8a7779 and Marzen base support V2

Initial support for the r8a7779 SoC and the Marzen board (V2).

Only SCIF ports and the TMU are supported at this point.

To keep things simple only entity-mapped virt-to-phys mappings
are supported. This forces drivers and other SoC glue code to
make use of ioremap(). We cannot support early serial console
due to virtual address space collisions with the ARM kernel.
