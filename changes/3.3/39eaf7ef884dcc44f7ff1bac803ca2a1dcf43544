tracing: Add entries in buffer and total entries to default output header

Knowing the number of event entries in the ring buffer compared
to the total number that were written is useful information. The
latency format gives this information and there's no reason that the
default format does not.

This information is now added to the default header, along with the
number of online CPUs:

 # tracer: nop
 #
 # entries-in-buffer/entries-written: 159836/64690869   #P:4
 #
 #                              _-----=> irqs-off
 #                             / _----=> need-resched
 #                            | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
 #                            || / _--=> preempt-depth
 #                            ||| /     delay
 #           TASK-PID   CPU#  ||||    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
 #              | |       |   ||||       |         |
           <idle>-0     [000] ...2    49.442971: local_touch_nmi <-cpu_idle
           <idle>-0     [000] d..2    49.442973: enter_idle <-cpu_idle
           <idle>-0     [000] d..2    49.442974: atomic_notifier_call_chain <-enter_idle
           <idle>-0     [000] d..2    49.442976: __atomic_notifier_call_chain <-atomic_notifier

The above shows that the trace contains 159836 entries, but
64690869 were written. One could figure out that there were
64531033 entries that were dropped.
