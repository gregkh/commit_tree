sparc32: support atomic64_t

There is no-one that really require atomic64_t support on sparc32.
But several drivers fails to build without proper atomic64 support.
And for an allyesconfig build for sparc32 this is annoying.

Include the generic atomic64_t support for sparc32.
This has a text footprint cost:

$size vmlinux (before atomic64_t support)
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3578860  134260  108781 3821901  3a514d vmlinux

$size vmlinux (after atomic64_t support)
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3579892  130684  108781 3819357  3a475d vmlinux

text increase (3579892 - 3578860) = 1032 bytes

data decreases - but I fail to explain why!
I have rebuild twice to check my numbers.
