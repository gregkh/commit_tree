virtio_net: set/cancel work on ndo_open/ndo_stop

Michael S. Tsirkin noticed that we could run the refill work after
ndo_close, which can re-enable napi - we don't disable it until
virtnet_remove.  This is clearly wrong, so move the workqueue control
to ndo_open and ndo_stop (aka. virtnet_open and virtnet_close).

One subtle point: virtnet_probe() could simply fail if it couldn't
allocate a receive buffer, but that's less polite in virtnet_open() so
we schedule a refill as we do in the normal receive path if we run out
of memory.
