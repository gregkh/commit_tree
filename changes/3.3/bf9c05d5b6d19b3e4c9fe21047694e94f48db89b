vmwgfx: Fix assignment in vmw_framebuffer_create_handle

The assignment of handle in vmw_framebuffer_create_handle doesn't actually do anything useful and is incorrectly assigning an integer value to a pointer argument. It appears that this is a typo and should be dereferencing handle rather than assigning to it directly. This fixes a bug where an undefined handle value is potentially returned to user-space.
