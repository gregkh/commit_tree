iommu/amd: Put IOMMUv2 capable devices in pt_domain

If the device starts to use IOMMUv2 features the dma handles
need to stay valid. The only sane way to do this is to use a
identity mapping for the device and not translate it by the
iommu. This is implemented with this patch. Since this lifts
the device-isolation there is also a new kernel parameter
which allows to disable that feature.
