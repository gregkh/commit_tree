mac80211: do not pass AP VLAN vif pointers to drivers

This fixes frequent WARN_ONs when using AP VLAN + aggregation, as these vifs
are virtual and not registered with drivers.
Use sta_info_get_bss instead of sta_info_get in aggregation callbacks, so
that these callbacks can find the station entry when called with the AP vif.
