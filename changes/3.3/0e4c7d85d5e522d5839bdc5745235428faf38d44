caif: Add support for flow-control on device's tx-queue

Flow control is implemented by inspecting the qdisc queue length
in order to detect potential overflow on the TX queue. When a threshold
is reached flow-off is sent upwards in the CAIF stack. At the same time
the skb->destructor is hi-jacked by orphaning the SKB and the original
destructor is replaced with a "flow-on" callback. When the "hi-jacked"
SKB is consumed the queue should be empty, and the "flow-on" callback
is called and xon is sent upwards in the CAIF stack.
