md/raid5: allow each slot to have an extra replacement device

Just enhance data structures to record a second device per slot to be
used as a 'replacement' device, replacing the original.
We also have a second bio in each slot in each stripe_head.  This will
only be used when writing to the array - we need to write to both the
original and the replacement at the same time, so will need two bios.

For now, only try using the replacement drive for aligned-reads.
In this case, we prefer the replacement if it has been recovered far
enough, otherwise use the original.

This includes a small enhancement.  Previously we would only do
aligned reads if the target device was fully recovered.  Now we also
do them if it has recovered far enough.
