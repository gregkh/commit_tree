HID: hid-input: allow array fields out of range

Allow array field values out of range as per HID 1.11 specification,
section 6.2.25:

	Rather than returning a single bit for each button in the group, an
	array returns an index in each field that corresponds to the pressed
	button (like keyboard scan codes). An out-of range value in and array
	field is considered no controls asserted.

Apparently, "and" above is a typo and should be "an".

This fixes at least Waltop tablet pen clicks - otherwise BTN_TOUCH is never
released.

The relevant part of Waltop tablet report descriptors is this:

	0x09, 0x42,         /*          Usage (Tip Switch),         */
	0x09, 0x44,         /*          Usage (Barrel Switch),      */
	0x09, 0x46,         /*          Usage (Tablet Pick),        */
	0x15, 0x01,         /*          Logical Minimum (1),        */
	0x25, 0x03,         /*          Logical Maximum (3),        */
	0x75, 0x04,         /*          Report Size (4),            */
	0x95, 0x01,         /*          Report Count (1),           */
	0x80,               /*          Input,                      */

This is a regression fix for commit b4b583d ("HID: be more strict when
ignoring out-of-range fields").
