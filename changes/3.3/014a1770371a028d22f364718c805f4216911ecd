ext4: add missing ext4_resize_end on error paths

Online resize ioctls 'EXT4_IOC_GROUP_EXTEND' and 'EXT4_IOC_GROUP_ADD'
call ext4_resize_begin() to check permissions and to set the
EXT4_RESIZING bit lock, they do their work and they must finish with
ext4_resize_end() which calls clear_bit_unlock() to unlock and to
avoid -EBUSY errors for the next resize operations.

This patch adds the missing ext4_resize_end() calls on error paths.

Patch tested.
