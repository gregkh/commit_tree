ARM: OMAP2+: mux: add wakeup-capable hwmod mux entries to dynamic list

omap_hwmod_mux() currently only iterates through the dynamic pad list.
This list currently only consists of pads with the
OMAP_DEVICE_MUX_REMUX flag set.

Subsequent patches in this series will cause hwmod mux entries with
the OMAP_DEVICE_MUX_WAKEUP flag set to be changed dynamically, to
control hwmod I/O ring wakeup.  For this to work correctly, hwmod mux
entries with the OMAP_DEVICE_MUX_WAKEUP flag set must also be added to
the dynamic pad list.  So this patch modifies omap_hwmod_mux_init() to
do so.
