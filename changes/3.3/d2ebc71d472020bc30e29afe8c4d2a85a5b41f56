x86/uv: Fix uninitialized spinlocks

Initialize two spinlocks in tlb_uv.c and also properly define/initialize
the uv_irq_lock.

The lack of explicit initialization seems to be functionally
harmless, but it is diagnosed when these are turned on:

        CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
        CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y
        CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y
        CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
