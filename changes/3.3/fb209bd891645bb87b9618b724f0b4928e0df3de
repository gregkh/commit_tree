x86, x2apic: Fallback to xapic when BIOS doesn't setup interrupt-remapping

On some of the recent Intel SNB platforms, by default bios is pre-enabling
x2apic mode in the cpu with out setting up interrupt-remapping.
This case was resulting in the kernel to panic as the cpu is already in
x2apic mode but the OS was not able to enable interrupt-remapping (which
is a pre-req for using x2apic capability).

On these platforms all the apic-ids are < 255 and the kernel can fallback to
xapic mode if the bios has not enabled interrupt-remapping (which is
mostly the case if the bios has not exported interrupt-remapping tables to the
OS).
