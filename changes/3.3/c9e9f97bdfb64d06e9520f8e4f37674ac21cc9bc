Btrfs: add basic restriper infrastructure

Add basic restriper infrastructure: extended balancing ioctl and all
related ioctl data structures, add data structure for tracking
restriper's state to fs_info, etc.  The semantics of the old balancing
ioctl are fully preserved.

Explicitly disallow any volume operations when balance is in progress.
