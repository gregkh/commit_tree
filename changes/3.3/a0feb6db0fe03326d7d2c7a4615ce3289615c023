ARM: 7358/1: perf: add PMU hotplug notifier

When a CPU is taken out of reset, either cold booted or hotplugged in,
some of its PMU registers can contain UNKNOWN values.

This patch adds a hotplug notifier to ARM core perf code so that upon
CPU restart the PMU unit is reset and becomes ready to use again.
