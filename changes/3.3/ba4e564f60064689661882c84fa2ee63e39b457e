Bluetooth: Add address type to mgmt_pair_device

The kernel needs to know whether it should connect to a device over
BR/EDR or over LE. This is particularly important in the future when
dual-mode device may be connectable also over LE. It is also important
if/when we decide to move the LE advertisement cache from the kernel
into user-space. Adding the type to the mgmt command also ensures
conformance with the latest mgmt API spec.
