mlx4_core: Added FW commands and their wrappers for supporting SRIOV

The following commands are added here:
1. QUERY_FUNC_CAP and its wrapper.  This function is used by VFs when
   they start up to receive configuration information from the PF, such
   as resource quotas for this VF, which ports should be used (currently
   two), what protocol is running on the port (currently Ethernet ONLY,
   or port not active).

2. QUERY_PORT and its wrapper. Previously, this FW command was invoked directly
   by the ETH driver (en_port.c) using mlx4_cmd_box. Virtualization is now
   required here (the VF's MAC address must be substituted for the PFs
   MAC address returned by the FW). We changed the invocation
   in the ETH driver to use mlx4_QUERY_PORT, and added the wrapper.

3. QUERY_HCA. Used by the VF to determine how the HCA was initialized.
   For now, we need only the multicast table member entry size
   (log2_mc_table_entry_sz, in the ConnectX PRM).  No wrapper is needed
   here, because the data may be passed as is to the VF without modification).

   In this command, we have added a GLOBAL_CAPS field for passing required
   configuration information from FW to a VF (this field is to allow safely
                   adding new SRIOV capabilities which require support in VF drivers, too).
   Bits will set here by FW in response to PF-driver configuration commands which
   will activate as yet undefined new SRIOV features. The VF will test to see that
   all required capabilities indicated by this field are supported (i.e., if a bit
   is set and the VF driver does not recognize that bit, it must abort
   its initialization).  Currently, no bits are set.

4. Added a CLOSE_PORT wrapper.  The PF context needs to keep track of how many VF contexts
   have the port open.  The PF context will not actually issue the FW close port command
   until the last port user issues a CLOSE_PORT request.
