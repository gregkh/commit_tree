[media] tuners: remove dvb_frontend_parameters from set_params()

This is a big patch, yet trivial: now that all tuners use the DVBv5
way to pass parameters (e. g. via fe->dtv_property_cache), the
extra parameter can be removed from set_params() call.

After this change, very few DVBv3 specific stuff are left at the
tuners.
