ALSA: hda: remove unused quirk for inverted mute led

Commit b99a776d0b17ae0f3a54e86009887a00ac4889d0 removed all effects of
the STAC92HD83* model quirk "hp". However, it left the model selection
and documentation behind, confusing users with inverted mute
leds. Completely remove this quirk and its documentation.
