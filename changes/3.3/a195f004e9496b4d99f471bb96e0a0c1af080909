sched: Fix load-balance lock-breaking

The current lock break relies on contention on the rq locks, something
which might never come because we've got IRQs disabled. Or will be
very likely because on anything with more than 2 cpus a synchronized
load-balance pass will very likely cause contention on the rq locks.

Also the sched_nr_migrate thing fails when it gets trapped the loops
of either the cgroup muck in load_balance_fair() or the move_tasks()
load condition.

Instead, use the new lb_flags field to propagate break/abort
conditions for all these loops and create a new loop outside the irq
disabled on the break being required.
