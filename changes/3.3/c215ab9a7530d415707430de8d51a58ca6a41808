x86: Add amilo-rfkill driver for some Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo laptops

An rfkill driver based on the fsaa1655g and fsam7440 drivers for
Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo A1655 and M7440 models found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/fsaa1655g/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fsam7440/

This adds DMI matching, replaces the procfs files with rfkill devices,
and uses the proper functions to write to the i8042 safely.
