mtd: cfi: Allow per-mapping CFI device endianness

This patch allows each CFI device map to use its own endianness. The
globally defined CFI endianness (CONFIG_MTD_CFI_NOSWAP,
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_BE_BYTE_SWAP or CONFIG_MTD_CFI_LE_BYTE_SWAP) becomes the
default value which can be overridden by a driver for a particular device.
