target: remove useless casts

A reader should spend an extra moment whenever noticing a cast,
because either something special is going on that deserves extra
attention or, as is all too often the case, the code is wrong.

These casts, afaics, have all been useless.  They cast a foo* to a
foo*, cast a void* to the assigned type, cast a foo* to void*, before
assigning it to a void* variable, etc.

In a few cases I also removed an additional &...[0], which is equally
useless.

Lastly I added three FIXMEs where, to the best of my judgement, the
code appears to have a bug.  It would be good if someone could check
these.
