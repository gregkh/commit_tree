vfs: fix panic in __d_lookup() with high dentry hashtable counts

When the number of dentry cache hash table entries gets too high
(2147483648 entries), as happens by default on a 16TB system, use of a
signed integer in the dcache_init() initialization loop prevents the
dentry_hashtable from getting initialized, causing a panic in
__d_lookup().  Fix this in dcache_init() and similar areas.
