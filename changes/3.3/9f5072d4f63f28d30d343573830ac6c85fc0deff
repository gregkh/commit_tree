powerpc: Fix wrong divisor in usecs_to_cputime

Commit d57af9b (taskstats: use real microsecond granularity for CPU times)
renamed msecs_to_cputime to usecs_to_cputime, but failed to update all
numbers on the way.  This causes nonsensical cpu idle/iowait values to be
displayed in /proc/stat (the only user of usecs_to_cputime so far).

This also renames __cputime_msec_factor to __cputime_usec_factor, adapting
its value and using it directly in cputime_to_usecs instead of doing two
multiplications.
