drm/i915: fixup forcewake spinlock fallout in drpc debugfs function

My forcewake spinlock patches have a functional conflict with Ben
Widawsky's gen6 drpc support for debugfs. Result was a benign warning
about trying to read an non-atomic variabla with atomic_read.

Note that the entire check is racy anyway and purely informational.
Also update it to reflect the forcewake voodoo changes, the kernel can
now also hold onto a forcewake reference for longer times.
