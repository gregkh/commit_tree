net/tcp: Fix tcp memory limits initialization when !CONFIG_SYSCTL

sysctl_tcp_mem() initialization was moved to sysctl_tcp_ipv4.c
in commit 3dc43e3e4d0b52197d3205214fe8f162f9e0c334, since it
became a per-ns value.

That code, however, will never run when CONFIG_SYSCTL is
disabled, leading to bogus values on those fields - causing hung
TCP sockets.

This patch fixes it by keeping an initialization code in
tcp_init(). It will be overwritten by the first net namespace
init if CONFIG_SYSCTL is compiled in, and do the right thing if
it is compiled out.

It is also named properly as tcp_init_mem(), to properly signal
its non-sysctl side effect on TCP limits.
