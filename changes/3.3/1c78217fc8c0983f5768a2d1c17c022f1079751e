cpufreq: OMAP: fix freq_table leak

We use a single frequency table for multiple CPUs. But, with
OMAP4, since we have multiple CPUs, the cpu_init call for CPU1
causes freq_table previously allocated for CPU0 to be overwritten.
In addition, we dont free the table on exit path.

We solve this by maintaining an atomic type counter to ensure
just a single table exists at a given time.
