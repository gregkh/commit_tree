tipc: Add new address conversion routines for Ethernet media

Enhances TIPC's Ethernet media support to provide 3 new address conversion
routines, which allow TIPC to interpret an address that is in string form
and to convert an address to and from the 20 byte format used in TIPC's
neighbor discovery messages.

These routines are pre-requisites to a follow on commit that hides all
media-specific addressing details from TIPC's generic bearer code.
