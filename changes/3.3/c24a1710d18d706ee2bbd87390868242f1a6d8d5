[SCSI] mpt2sas: Fix leak on mpt2sas_base_attach() error path

Commit 911ae9434f83 ("[SCSI] mpt2sas: Added NUNA IO support in driver
which uses multi-reply queue support of the HBA") added new
allocations to the beginning of mpt2sas_base_attach(), which means
directly returning an error on failure of mpt2sas_base_map_resources()
will leak those allocations.

Fix this by doing "goto out_free_resources" in this place too, as the
rest of the function does.
