gpio-ml-ioh: cleanup __iomem annotation usage

The __iomem annotation is to be used together with pointers used
in iowrite32() but not for pointers returned by kzalloc().
For more details see [1] and [2].

This patch will remove the following sparse warning (i.e. when
copiling with "make C=1"):
 * warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
