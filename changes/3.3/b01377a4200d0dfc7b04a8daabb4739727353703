caif: Bugfix list_del_rcu race in cfmuxl_ctrlcmd.

Always use cfmuxl_remove_uplayer when removing a up-layer.
cfmuxl_ctrlcmd() can be called independently and in parallel with
cfmuxl_remove_uplayer(). The race between them could cause list_del_rcu
to be called on a node which has been already taken out from the list.
That lead to a (rare) crash on accessing poisoned node->prev inside
list_del_rcu.

This fix ensures that deletion are done holding the same lock.
