ARM: OMAP2+: UART: Add wakeup mechanism for omap-uarts

From the runtime callbacks enable hwmod wakeups for uart which will
internally enable io-pad wakeups for uarts if they have rx-pad pins
set as wakeup capabale.

Use the io-ring wakeup mechanism after uart clock gating and leave
the PM_WKST set for uart to default reset values cleanup the
code in serial.c which was handling PM_WKST reg.
Irq_chaing(PRM_DRIVER) is used to wakeup uart after uart clocks are gated
using pad wakeup mechanism.
