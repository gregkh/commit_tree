ARM: OMAP1: Fix out-of-bounds array access for Innovator

Otherwise we can get the following on some compilers:

arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-innovator.c:419:19: warning:
array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-innovator.c:425:19: warning:
array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
