TTY: move debug checking out of tty_release

There is no need to taint the tty_release code with paranoia
checking. So move it out of line to a separate function. Making thus
tty_release more readable.

[v2] don't introduce a hard to reproduce use after free (scheduled work would
     need to preempt the current thread)
