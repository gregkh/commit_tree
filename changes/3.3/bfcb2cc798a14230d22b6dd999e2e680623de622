checkpatch: catch all occurences of type and cast spacing errors per line

Fix up type and cast spacing checks such that all occurences on a line are
examined and reported.  For example the line below has a valid cast and a
bad type, but currently we check the cast first which is good and stop:

    u16* bar = (u16 *)baz;

We will also only report one of the errors in this example:

    u16* bar = (u16*)bad;

Move to iterating across all casts and all types, reporting any failure.
