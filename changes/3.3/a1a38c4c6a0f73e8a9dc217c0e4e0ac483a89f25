crypto: caam - remove DECO access initialization code

Access to the SEC4 DECOs (DEscriptor COntrollers) (for debug purposes)
isn't supported or used, and its register access initialization code
erroneously makes illegal i/o accesses that show up as errors when
run under simulation.  Remove it until proper support (via DECORR)
is added.
