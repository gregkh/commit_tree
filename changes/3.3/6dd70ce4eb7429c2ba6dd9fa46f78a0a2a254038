btrfs: Fix busyloops in transaction waiting code

wait_log_commit() and wait_for_writer() were using slightly different
conditions for deciding whether they should call schedule() and whether they
should continue in the wait loop. Thus it could happen that we busylooped when
the first condition was not true while the second one was. That is burning CPU
cycles needlessly and is deadly on UP machines...
