mm/hugetlb.c: fix virtual address handling in hugetlb fault

handle_mm_fault() passes 'faulted' address to hugetlb_fault().  This
address is not aligned to a hugepage boundary.

Most of the functions for hugetlb pages are aware of that and calculate an
alignment themselves.  However some functions such as
copy_user_huge_page() and clear_huge_page() don't handle alignment by
themselves.

This patch make hugeltb_fault() fix the alignment and pass an aligned
addresss (to address of a faulted hugepage) to functions.
