Bluetooth: recalculate priorities when channels are starving

To avoid starvation the priority is recalculated so that the starving
channels are promoted to HCI_PRIO_MAX - 1 (6).

HCI_PRIO_MAX (7) is considered special, because it requires CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability which can be used to provide more guaranties, so it is not used
when promoting.
