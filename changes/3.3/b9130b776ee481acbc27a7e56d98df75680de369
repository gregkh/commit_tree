pinctrl: add checks for empty function names

This is needed as otherwise we can get the following when
dealing with buggy data in a pinmux driver for
pinmux_search_function:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
address 00000000
...
PC is at strcmp+0xc/0x34
LR is at pinmux_get+0x350/0x8f4
...

As we need pctldev initialized to call ops->list_functions,
let's initialize it before check_ops calls and pass the
pctldev to the check_ops functions. Do this for both pinmux
and pinconf check_ops functions.
