autofs4 - fix deal with autofs4_write races

I don't know how I missed this obvious mistake when I
reviewed Als' patches, sorry.

[ Quoting Al:

	Grr...  Note to self: do git status *and* git stash show -p
	before git push.  Nothing like "WTF? I'd fixed that braino"
	feeling ;-/

  Al sent the same patch - it got broken in commit d668dc56631d:
  "autofs4: deal with autofs4_write/autofs4_write races". ]
