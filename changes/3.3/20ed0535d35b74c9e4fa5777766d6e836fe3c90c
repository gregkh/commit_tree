GFS2: Fix up REQ flags

Christoph has split up REQ_PRIO from REQ_META. That means that
we can drop REQ_PRIO from places where is it not needed. I'm
not at all sure that the combination WRITE_FLUSH_FUA | REQ_PRIO
makes any kind of sense, anyway.

In addition, I've added REQ_META to one place in the code where
it was missing. REQ_PRIO has been left for read/writes triggered
by glock acquisition and writeback only. We can adjust it again
if required, but these are the most important points from a
performance perspective.
