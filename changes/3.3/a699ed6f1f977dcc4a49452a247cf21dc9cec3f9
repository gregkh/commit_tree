i2c-dev: Use memdup_user

Use memdup_user rather than duplicating its implementation.
This is a little bit restricted to reduce false positives.

The semantic patch that makes this output is available
in scripts/coccinelle/api/memdup_user.cocci.

More information about semantic patching is available at
