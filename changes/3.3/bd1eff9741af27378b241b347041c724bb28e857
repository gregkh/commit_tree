Staging: android: binder: Fix crashes when sharing a binder file between processes

Opening the binder driver and sharing the file returned with
other processes (e.g. by calling fork) can crash the kernel.
Prevent these crashes with the following changes:
- Add a mutex to protect against two processes mmapping the
  same binder_proc.
- After locking mmap_sem, check that the vma we want to access
  (still) points to the same mm_struct.
- Use proc->tsk instead of current to get the files struct since
  this is where we get the rlimit from.
