net: Remove LL_ALLOCATED_SPACE

The macro LL_ALLOCATED_SPACE was ill-conceived.  It applies the
alignment to the sum of needed_headroom and needed_tailroom.  As
the amount that is then reserved for head room is needed_headroom
with alignment, this means that the tail room left may be too small.

Now that all uses of LL_ALLOCATED_SPACE have been removed, this
patch finally removes the macro itself.
