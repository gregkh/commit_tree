tcp: skip cwnd moderation in TCP_CA_Open in tcp_try_to_open

The problem: Senders were overriding cwnd values picked during an undo
by calling tcp_moderate_cwnd() in tcp_try_to_open().

The fix: Don't moderate cwnd in tcp_try_to_open() if we're in
TCP_CA_Open, since doing so is generally unnecessary and specifically
would override a DSACK-based undo of a cwnd reduction made in fast
recovery.
