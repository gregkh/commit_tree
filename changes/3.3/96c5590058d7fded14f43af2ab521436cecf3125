PCI: Pull PCI 'latency timer' setup up into the core

The 'latency timer' of PCI devices, both Type 0 and Type 1,
is setup in architecture-specific code [see: 'pcibios_set_master()'].
There are two approaches being taken by all the architectures - check
if the 'latency timer' is currently set between 16 and 255 and if not
bring it within bounds, or, do nothing (and then there is the
gratuitously different PA-RISC implementation).

There is nothing architecture-specific about PCI's 'latency timer' so
this patch pulls its setup functionality up into the PCI core by
creating a generic 'pcibios_set_master()' function using the '__weak'
attribute which can be used by all architectures as a default which,
if necessary, can then be over-ridden by architecture-specific code.

No functional change.
