PM / Hibernate: Thaw processes in SNAPSHOT_CREATE_IMAGE ioctl test path

Commit 2aede851ddf08666f68ffc17be446420e9d2a056 (PM / Hibernate: Freeze
kernel threads after preallocating memory) moved the freezing of kernel
threads to hibernation_snapshot() function.

So now, if the call to hibernation_snapshot() returns early due to a
successful hibernation test, the caller has to thaw processes to ensure
that the system gets back to its original state.

But in SNAPSHOT_CREATE_IMAGE hibernation ioctl, the caller does not thaw
processes in case hibernation_snapshot() returned due to a successful
freezer test. Fix this issue. But note we still send the value of 'in_suspend'
(which is now 0) to userspace, because we are not in an error path per-se,
and moreover, the value of in_suspend correctly depicts the situation here.
