m68k: modify user space access functions to support ColdFire CPUs

Modify the user space access functions to support the ColdFire V4e cores
running with MMU enabled.

The ColdFire processors do not support the "moves" instruction used by
the traditional 680x0 processors for moving data into and out of another
address space. They only support the notion of a single address space,
and you use the usual "move" instruction to access that.

Create a new config symbol (CONFIG_CPU_HAS_ADDRESS_SPACES) to mark the
CPU types that support separate address spaces, and thus also support
the sfc/dfc registers and the "moves" instruction that go along with that.

The code is almost identical for user space access, so lets just use a
define to choose either the "move" or "moves" in the assembler code.
