slub: fix a possible memleak in __slab_alloc()

Zhihua Che reported a possible memleak in slub allocator on
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y builds.

It is possible current thread migrates right before disabling irqs in
__slab_alloc(). We must check again c->freelist, and perform a normal
allocation instead of scratching c->freelist.

Many thanks to Zhihua Che for spotting this bug, introduced in 2.6.39

V2: Its also possible an IRQ freed one (or several) object(s) and
populated c->freelist, so its not a CONFIG_PREEMPT only problem.
