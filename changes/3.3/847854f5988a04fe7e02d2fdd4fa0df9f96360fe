memblock: Fix size aligning of memblock_alloc_base_nid()

memblock allocator aligns @size to @align to reduce the amount
of fragmentation.  Commit:

 7bd0b0f0da ("memblock: Reimplement memblock allocation using reverse free area iterator")

Broke it by incorrectly relocating @size aligning to
memblock_find_in_range_node().  As the aligned size is not
propagated back to memblock_alloc_base_nid(), the actually
reserved size isn't aligned.

While this increases memory use for memblock reserved array,
this shouldn't cause any critical failure; however, it seems
that the size aligning was hiding a use-beyond-allocation bug in
sparc64 and losing the aligning causes boot failure.

The underlying problem is currently being debugged but this is a
proper fix in itself, it's already pretty late in -rc cycle for
boot failures and reverting the change for debugging isn't
difficult. Restore the size aligning moving it to
memblock_alloc_base_nid().
