ALSA: HDA: Add support for Cirrus Logic 4213

The CS4213 chip is similar to the CS4210, but it does not have
SPDIF capabilities. Also, it has fewer pins, and the vendor specific
nid is different. With this patch, we have working inputs and outputs
(and automute/autoswitch). However, we don't know anything about
the vendor specific processing coefficients, so we don't read or write
to that node in this patch.
