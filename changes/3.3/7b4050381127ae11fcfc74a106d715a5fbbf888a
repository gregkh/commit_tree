PM/Devfreq: Add Exynos4-bus device DVFS driver for Exynos4210/4212/4412.

Exynos4-bus device devfreq driver add DVFS capability for
Exynos4210/4212/4412-Bus (memory). The driver monitors PPMU counters of memory
controllers and adjusts operating frequencies and voltages with OPP.
For Exynos4210, vdd_int is controlled. For exynos4412/4212, vdd_mif and
vdd_int are controlled.

Dependency (CONFIG_EXYNOS_ASV):
Exynos4 ASV driver has been posted in the mailing list; however, it
si not yet upstreamed. Although the current revision of Exynos4 ASV
patch does not contain "CONFIG_EXYNOS_ASV", we have added the symbol
to hide the dependent from compilers for now. As soon as Exynos4 ASV
drivers are merged, the #ifdef statement will be removed or the
name will be changed.

However, enabling ASV is essential in most Exynos4 chips to reduce
the power consumption of Exynos4210 because without ASV, this Devfreq
driver assumes the worst case scenario, which consumes more power.
