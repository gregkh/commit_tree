ARM: 7208/1: Add condition code checking to SWP emulation handler.

This patch fixes two separate issues with the SWP emulation handler:
1: Certain processors implementing ARMv7-A can (legally) take an
   undef exception even when the condition code would have meant that
   the instruction should not have been executed.
2: Opcodes with all flags set (condition code = 0xf) have been reused
   in recent, and not-so-recent, versions of the ARM architecture to
   implement unconditional extensions to the instruction set. The
   existing code would still have processed any undefs triggered by
   executing an opcode with such a value.

This patch uses the new generic ARM instruction set condition code
checks to implement proper handling of these situations.
