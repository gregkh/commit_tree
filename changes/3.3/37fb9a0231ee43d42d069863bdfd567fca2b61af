powerpc/time: Handle wrapping of decrementer

When re-enabling interrupts we have code to handle edge sensitive
decrementers by resetting the decrementer to 1 whenever it is negative.
If interrupts were disabled long enough that the decrementer wrapped to
positive we do nothing. This means interrupts can be delayed for a long
time until it finally goes negative again.

While we hope interrupts are never be disabled long enough for the
decrementer to go positive, we have a very good test team that can
drive any kernel into the ground. The softlockup data we get back
from these fails could be seconds in the future, completely missing
the cause of the lockup.

We already keep track of the timebase of the next event so use that
to work out if we should trigger a decrementer exception.
