flush_tlb_range() needs ->page_table_lock when ->mmap_sem is not held

All other callers already hold either ->mmap_sem (exclusive) or
->page_table_lock.  And we need it because some page table flushing
instanced do work explicitly with ge tables.

See e.g.  arch/powerpc/mm/tlb_hash32.c, flush_tlb_range() and
flush_range() in there.  The same goes for uml, with a lot more
extensive playing with page tables.

Almost all callers are actually fine - flush_tlb_range() may have no
need to bother playing with page tables, but it can do so safely; again,
this caller is the sole exception - everything else either has exclusive
->mmap_sem on the mm in question, or mm->page_table_lock is held.
