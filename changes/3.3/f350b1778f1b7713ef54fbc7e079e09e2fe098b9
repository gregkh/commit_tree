sparc: make SA_NOMASK a synonym of SA_NODEFER

Unlike other architectures, sparc currently has no SA_NODEFER definition
but only the older SA_NOMASK.  Since SA_NOMASK is the historical name for
SA_NODEFER, add SA_NODEFER and copy what other architectures do by making
SA_NOMASK a synonym for SA_NODEFER.
