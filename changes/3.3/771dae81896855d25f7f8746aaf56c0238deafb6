powerpc/cpuidle: Add cpu_idle_wait() to allow switching of idle routines

This patch provides cpu_idle_wait() routine for the powerpc
platform which is required by the cpuidle subsystem. This
routine is required to change the idle handler on SMP systems.
The equivalent routine for x86 is in arch/x86/kernel/process.c
but the powerpc implementation is different.

cpuidle_disable variable is to enable/disable cpuidle
framework if power_save option is set during the boot
time.
