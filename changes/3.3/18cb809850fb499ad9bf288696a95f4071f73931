net_sched: sfq: extend limits

SFQ as implemented in Linux is very limited, with at most 127 flows
and limit of 127 packets. [ So if 127 flows are active, we have one
packet per flow ]

This patch brings to SFQ following features to cope with modern needs.

- Ability to specify a smaller per flow limit of inflight packets.
    (default value being at 127 packets)

- Ability to have up to 65408 active flows (instead of 127)

- Ability to have head drops instead of tail drops
  (to drop old packets from a flow)

Example of use : No more than 20 packets per flow, max 8000 flows, max
20000 packets in SFQ qdisc, hash table of 65536 slots.

tc qdisc add ... sfq \
        flows 8000 \
        depth 20 \
        headdrop \
        limit 20000 \
	divisor 65536

Ram usage :

2 bytes per hash table entry (instead of previous 1 byte/entry)
32 bytes per flow on 64bit arches, instead of 384 for QFQ, so much
better cache hit ratio.
