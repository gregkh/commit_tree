Btrfs: new backref walking code

The old backref iteration code could only safely be used on commit roots.
Besides this limitation, it had bugs in finding the roots for these
references. This commit replaces large parts of it by btrfs_find_all_roots()
which a) really finds all roots and the correct roots, b) works correctly
under heavy file system load, c) considers delayed refs.
