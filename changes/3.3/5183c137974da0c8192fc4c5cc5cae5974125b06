[media] budget-ci: Fix Hauppauge RC-5 IR support

Hauppauge RC-5 tables require the full scancodes. The code at budget-ci
handles it right, however, it request the rc-code to mask them with 0xff,
breaking support for some remote controllers.

Fix it by not selecting a scancode mask when the driver is on full_rc5 mode.
