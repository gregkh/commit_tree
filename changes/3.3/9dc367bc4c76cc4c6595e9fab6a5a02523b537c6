Driver for GE PIO2 VME Card

This patch implements a driver for the GE PIO2 VME Parallel I/O Card.  This
card is a 6U VME Card, implementing 32 solid-state relay switched IO lines,
in 4 groups of 8. Each bank of IO lines is built to function as input,
output or both depending on the variant of the card.
