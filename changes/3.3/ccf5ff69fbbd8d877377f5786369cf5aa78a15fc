net: new counter for tx_timeout errors in sysfs

This adds the /sys/class/net/DEV/queues/Q/tx_timeout attribute
containing the total number of timeout events on the given queue. It
is always available with CONFIG_SYSFS, independently of
CONFIG_RPS/XPS.

Credits to Stephen Hemminger for a preliminary version of this patch.

Tested:
  without CONFIG_SYSFS (compilation only)
  with sysfs and without CONFIG_RPS & CONFIG_XPS
  with sysfs and without CONFIG_RPS
  with sysfs and without CONFIG_XPS
  with defaults
