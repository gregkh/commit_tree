ALSA: asihpi - Remove redundant struct members.

Structs hpi_adapter and snd_card_asihpi had members that
duplicate those in underlying hpi_adapter_obj or whose info
can be retrieved using hpi_adapter_get_info().

Print less info in probe function, it can be retrieved from /proc.

Avoid name redundancy: hpi_adapter_obj.adapter_type renamed to .type
