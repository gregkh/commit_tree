kprobes: silence DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS=y warning

Enabling DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS causes the following warning:

  In file included from arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:573,
                   from kernel/kprobes.c:55:
  In function 'copy_from_user',
      inlined from 'write_enabled_file_bool' at
      kernel/kprobes.c:2191:
  arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:65:
  warning: call to 'copy_from_user_overflow' declared with attribute warning: copy_from_user() buffer size is not provably correct

presumably due to buf_size being signed causing GCC to fail to see that
buf_size can't become negative.
