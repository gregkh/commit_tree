btree: export btree_get_prev() so modules can use btree_for_each

The btree_for_each API is implemented with macros that internally call
btree_get_prev(), so if btree_get_prev() isn't exported then modules fail
to link if they try to use one of the btree_for_each macros.  Since the
rest of the btree API is exported, we should keep things orthogonal and
make this work too.
