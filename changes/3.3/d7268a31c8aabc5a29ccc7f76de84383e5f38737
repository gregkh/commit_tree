CPU: Add right qualifiers for alloc_frozen_cpus() and cpu_hotplug_pm_sync_init()

Add __init for functions alloc_frozen_cpus() and cpu_hotplug_pm_sync_init()
because they are only called during boot time.

Add static for function cpu_hotplug_pm_sync_init() because its scope is limited
in this file only.
