hwmon: (f75375s) Catch some attempts to write to r/o registers

It makes no sense to attempt to manually configure the fan in auto mode,
or set the duty cycle directly in closed loop mode.  The corresponding
registers are then read-only.  If the user tries it nonetheless, error out
with EINVAL instead of silently doing nothing.
