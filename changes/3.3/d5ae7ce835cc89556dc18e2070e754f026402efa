KVM: x86: tag the instructions which are used to write page table

The idea is from Avi:
| tag instructions that are typically used to modify the page tables, and
| drop shadow if any other instruction is used.
| The list would include, I'd guess, and, or, bts, btc, mov, xchg, cmpxchg,
| and cmpxchg8b.

This patch is used to tag the instructions and in the later path, shadow page
is dropped if it is written by other instructions
