CHROMIUM: i915: Add DMI override to skip CRT initialization on ZGB

This is the method used to override LVDS in intel_lvds and appears to be
an effective way to ensure that the driver does not enable VGA hotplug.

This is the same patch from 2.6.32 kernel in R12 but ported to 2.6.38,
will send upstream next.

BUG=chrome-os-partner:117
TEST=Check PORT_HOTPLUG_EN to see if hotplug interrupt is disabled.
Run the following command as root, specifically looking at bit 9:
mmio_read32 $[$(pci_read32 0 2 0 0x10) + 0x61110] = 0x00000000
