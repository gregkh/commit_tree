Staging: zram: Add a missing GFP_KERNEL specifier in zram_init_device()

The allocation of zram->compress_buffer is misssing a GFP_* specifier.
This is equivalent to GFP_NOWAIT but it is more likely a omission.
Since the allocation just above it uses GFP_KERNEL, there is no reason
to use GFP_NOWAIT here. Therefore, add GFP_KERNEL.
