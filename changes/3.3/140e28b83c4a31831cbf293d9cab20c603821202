staging: line6: alloc/free buffers in hw_params/hw_free

It is unsafe to free buffers in line6_pcm_stop(), which is not allowed
to sleep, since urbs cannot be killed completely there and only
unlinked.  This means I/O may still be in progress and the URB
completion function still gets invoked.  This may result in memory
corruption when buffer_in is freed but I/O is still pending.

Additionally, line6_pcm_start() is not supposed to sleep so it should
not use kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL).

These issues can be resolved by performing buffer allocation/freeing in
the .hw_params/.hw_free callbacks instead.  The ALSA documentation also
recommends doing buffer allocation/freeing in these callbacks.
