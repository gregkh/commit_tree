Btrfs: rewrite btrfs_trim_block_group()

There are various bugs in block group trimming:

- It may trim from offset smaller than user-specified offset.
- It may trim beyond user-specified range.
- It may leak free space for extents smaller than specified minlen.
- It may truncate the last trimmed extent thus leak free space.
- With mixed extents+bitmaps, some extents may not be trimmed.
- With mixed extents+bitmaps, some bitmaps may not be trimmed (even
none will be trimmed). Even for those trimmed, not all the free space
in the bitmaps will be trimmed.

I rewrite btrfs_trim_block_group() and break it into two functions.
One is to trim extents only, and the other is to trim bitmaps only.

Before patching:

	# fstrim -v /mnt/
	/mnt/: 1496465408 bytes were trimmed

After patching:

	# fstrim -v /mnt/
	/mnt/: 2193768448 bytes were trimmed

And this matches the total free space:

	# btrfs fi df /mnt
	Data: total=3.58GB, used=1.79GB
	System, DUP: total=8.00MB, used=4.00KB
	System: total=4.00MB, used=0.00
	Metadata, DUP: total=205.12MB, used=97.14MB
	Metadata: total=8.00MB, used=0.00
