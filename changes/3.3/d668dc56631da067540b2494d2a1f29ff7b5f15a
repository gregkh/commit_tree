autofs4: deal with autofs4_write/autofs4_write races

Just serialize the actual writing of packets into pipe on
a new mutex, independent from everything else in the locking
hierarchy.  As soon as something has started feeding a piece
of packet into the pipe to daemon, we *want* everything else
about to try the same to wait until we are done.
