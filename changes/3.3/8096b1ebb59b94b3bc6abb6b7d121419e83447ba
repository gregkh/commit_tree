xfs: remove the if_ext_max field in struct xfs_ifork

We spent a lot of effort to maintain this field, but it always equals to the
fork size divided by the constant size of an extent.  The prime use of it is
to assert that the two stay in sync.  Just divide the fork size by the extent
size in the few places that we actually use it and remove the overhead
of maintaining it.  Also introduce a few helpers to consolidate the places
where we actually care about the value.
