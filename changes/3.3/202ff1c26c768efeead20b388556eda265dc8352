tg3: Fix advertisement handling

Commit 28011cf19b (net: Add ethtool to mii advertisment conversion
helpers) added a helper function ethtool_adv_to_mii_100bt() and
tg3_copper_is_advertising_all(), tg3_phy_autoneg_cfg() were
modified to use this.
Before that commit, ethtool to mii advertisement conversion was
done wrt speed, but now pause operation is also taken account.
So, in tg3_copper_is_advertising_all(), below condition becomes
true and this makes link up fails.

	if ((adv_reg & ADVERTISE_ALL) != all_mask)
		return 0;

To fix this add ADVERTISE_ALL bit and operation to cap speed,
and change default advertisement not including ADVERTISED_Pause.
