omap-serial: Add minimal device tree support

Adapt the driver to device tree and pass minimal platform
data from device tree needed for console boot.
No power management features will be suppported for now
since it requires more tweaks around OCP settings
to toggle forceidle/noidle/smartidle bits and handling
remote wakeup and dynamic muxing.
