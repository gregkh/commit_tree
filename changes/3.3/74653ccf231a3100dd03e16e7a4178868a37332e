MIPS/Perf-events: Remove erroneous check on active_events

Port the following patch for ARM by Mark Rutland:

- 57ce9bb39b476accf8fba6e16aea67ed76ea523d
    ARM: 6902/1: perf: Remove erroneous check on active_events

    When initialising a PMU, there is a check to protect against races with
    other CPUs filling all of the available event slots. Since armpmu_add
    checks that an event can be scheduled, we do not need to do this at
    initialisation time. Furthermore the current code is broken because it
    assumes that atomic_inc_not_zero will unconditionally increment
    active_counts and then tries to decrement it again on failure.

    This patch removes the broken, redundant code.
