md/raid1: Allocate spare to store replacement devices and their bios.

In RAID1, a replacement is much like a normal device, so we just
double the size of the relevant arrays and look at all possible
devices for reads and writes.

This means that the array looks like it is now double the size in some
way - we need to be careful about that.
In particular, we checking if the array is still degraded while
creating a recovery request we need to only consider the first 'half'
- i.e. the real (non-replacement) devices.
