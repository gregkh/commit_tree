usb: option: add ZD Incorporated HSPA modem

Add support for Chinese Noname HSPA USB modem which is apparently
manufactured by a company called ZD Incorporated (based on texts in the
Windows drivers).

This product is available at least from Dealextreme (SKU 80032) and
possibly in India with name Olive V-MW250. It is based on Qualcomm
MSM6280 chip.

I needed to also add "options usb-storage quirks=0685:7000:i" in modprobe
configuration because udevd or the kernel keeps poking the embedded
fake-cd-rom which fails and causes the device to reset. There might be
a better way to accomplish the same. usb_modeswitch is not needed with
this device.
