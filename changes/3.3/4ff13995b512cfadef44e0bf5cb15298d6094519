ARM: SAMSUNG: Fix GPIO space reservation for S3C64xx platforms

The conversion to use SAMSUNG_GPIO_EXTRA rather than S3C24XX_GPIO_EXTRA
broke a number of S3C64xx boards which had been using the symbols provided
to reserve a range of GPIOs for board specific use. Fix this by adding
equivalent symbols for the new shared driver and updating the relevant
boards to use the new symbols.
