mm: memcg: remove optimization of keeping the root_mem_cgroup LRU lists empty

root_mem_cgroup, lacking a configurable limit, was never subject to
limit reclaim, so the pages charged to it could be kept off its LRU
lists.  They would be found on the global per-zone LRU lists upon
physical memory pressure and it made sense to avoid uselessly linking
them to both lists.

The global per-zone LRU lists are about to go away on memcg-enabled
kernels, with all pages being exclusively linked to their respective
per-memcg LRU lists.  As a result, pages of the root_mem_cgroup must
also be linked to its LRU lists again.  This is purely about the LRU
list, root_mem_cgroup is still not charged.

The overhead is temporary until the double-LRU scheme is going away
completely.
