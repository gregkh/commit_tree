NVMe: Change the definition of nvme_user_io

The read and write commands don't define a 'result', so there's no need
to copy it back to userspace.

Remove the ability of the ioctl to submit commands to a different
namespace; it's just asking for trouble, and the use case I have in mind
will be addressed througha  different ioctl in the future.  That removes
the need for both the block_shift and nsid arguments.

Check that the opcode is one of 'read' or 'write'.  Future opcodes may
be added in the future, but we will need a different structure definition
for them.

The nblocks field is redefined to be 0-based.  This allows the user to
request the full 65536 blocks.

Don't byteswap the reftag, apptag and appmask.  Martin Petersen tells
me these are calculated in big-endian and are transmitted to the device
in big-endian.
