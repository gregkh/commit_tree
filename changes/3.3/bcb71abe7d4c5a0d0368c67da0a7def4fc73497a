iommu: Add option to group multi-function devices

The option iommu=group_mf indicates the that the iommu driver should
expose all functions of a multi-function PCI device as the same
iommu_device_group.  This is useful for disallowing individual functions
being exposed as independent devices to userspace as there are often
hidden dependencies.  Virtual functions are not affected by this option.
