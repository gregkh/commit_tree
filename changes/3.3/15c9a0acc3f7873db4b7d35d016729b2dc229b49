of: create of_phandle_args to simplify return of phandle parsing data

of_parse_phandle_with_args() needs to return quite a bit of data.  Rather
than making each datum a separate **out_ argument, this patch creates
struct of_phandle_args to contain all the returned data and reworks the
user of the function.  This patch also enables of_parse_phandle_with_args()
to return the device node pointer for the phandle node.

This patch also ends up being fairly major surgery to
of_parse_handle_with_args().  The existing structure didn't work well
when extending to use of_phandle_args, and I discovered bugs during testing.
I also took the opportunity to rename the function to be like the
existing of_parse_phandle().

v2: - moved declaration of of_phandle_args to fix compile on non-DT builds
    - fixed incorrect index in example usage
    - fixed incorrect return code handling for empty entries
