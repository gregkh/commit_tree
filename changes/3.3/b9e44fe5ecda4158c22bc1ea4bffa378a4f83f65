USB: option: cleanup zte 3g-dongle's pid in option.c

  1. Remove all old mass-storage ids's pid:
     0x0026,0x0053,0x0098,0x0099,0x0149,0x0150,0x0160;
  2. As the pid from 0x1401 to 0x1510 which have not surely assigned to
     use for serial-port or mass-storage port,so i think it should be
     removed now, and will re-add after it have assigned in future;
  3. sort the pid to WCDMA and CDMA.
