rcu: Detect illegal rcu dereference in extended quiescent state

Report that none of the rcu read lock maps are held while in an RCU
extended quiescent state (the section between rcu_idle_enter()
and rcu_idle_exit()). This helps detect any use of rcu_dereference()
and friends from within the section in idle where RCU is not allowed.

This way we can guarantee an extended quiescent window where the CPU
can be put in dyntick idle mode or can simply aoid to be part of any
global grace period completion while in the idle loop.

Uses of RCU from such mode are totally ignored by RCU, hence the
importance of these checks.
