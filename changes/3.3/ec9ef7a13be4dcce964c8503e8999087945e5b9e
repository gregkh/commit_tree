Btrfs: simplfy calculation of stripe length for discard operation

For btrfs raid, while discarding a range of space, we'll need to know
the start offset and length to discard for each device, and it's done
in btrfs_map_block().

However the calculation is a bit complex for raid0 and raid10, so I
reimplement it based on a fact that:

        dev1          dev2           dev3    (raid0)
        -----------------------------------
        s0 s3 s6      s1 s4 s7       s2 s5

Each device has (total_stripes / nr_dev) stripes, or plus one.
