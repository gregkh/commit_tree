Subject: [PATCH] drm: Make the per-driver file_operations struct const

The DRM layer keeps a copy of struct file_operations inside its
big driver struct... which prevents it from being consistent and static.
For consistency (and the general security objective of having such things
static), it's desirable to get this fixed.

This patch splits out the file_operations field to its own struct,
which is then "static const", and just stick a pointer to this into
the driver struct, making it more consistent with how the rest of the
kernel does this.
