net/smsc911x: Check if PHY is in operational mode before software reset

SMSC LAN generation 4 chips integrate an IEEE 802.3 ethernet physical layer.
The PHY driver for this integrated chip enable an energy detect power-down mode.
When the PHY is in a power-down mode, it prevents the MAC portion chip to be
software reseted.

That means that if we compile the kernel with the configuration option SMSC_PHY
enabled and try to bring the network interface up without an cable plug-ed the
PHY will be in a low power mode and the software reset will fail returning -EIO
to user-space:

root@igep00x0:~# ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig: SIOCSIFFLAGS: Input/output error

This patch disable the energy detect power-down mode before trying to software
reset the LAN chip and re-enables after it was reseted successfully.
