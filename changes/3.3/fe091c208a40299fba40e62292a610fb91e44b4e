memblock: Kill memblock_init()

memblock_init() initializes arrays for regions and memblock itself;
however, all these can be done with struct initializers and
memblock_init() can be removed.  This patch kills memblock_init() and
initializes memblock with struct initializer.

The only difference is that the first dummy entries don't have .nid
set to MAX_NUMNODES initially.  This doesn't cause any behavior
difference.
