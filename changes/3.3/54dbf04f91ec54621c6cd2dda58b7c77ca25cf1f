staging: et131x: Remove section comments

Following the move to put the driver into one file, comments were added to identify which source file each set of functions originated from.
These no longer made sense after functions were moved around to remove some forward declarations, so remove them.

A function comment was previously not moved along with its function, now they are reunited.
