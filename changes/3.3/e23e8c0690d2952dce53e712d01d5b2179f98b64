ARM/PCI: Remove ARM's duplicate definition of 'pcibios_max_latency'

The patch series to re-factor PCI's 'latency timer' setup (re:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=131983853831049&w=2) forgot to
remove the ARM specific definition of 'pcibios_max_latency' once such
had been moved into the pci core resulting in ARM related compile
errors -
  drivers/built-in.o:(.data+0x230): multiple definition of
  `pcibios_max_latency'
  arch/arm/common/built-in.o:(.data+0x40c): first defined here
  make[1]: *** [vmlinux.o] Error 1

In the series, patch 2/16 (commit 168c8619fd8) converted the ARM
specific version of 'pcibios_set_master()' to a non-inlined version.
This was done in preperation for hosting it up into PCI's core, which
was done in patch 10/16 (commit 96c5590058d) of the series (and
where the removal of ARM's 'pcibios_max_latency' was overlooked).
