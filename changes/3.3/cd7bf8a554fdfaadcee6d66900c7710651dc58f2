gpio-pch: cleanup __iomem annotation usage

The __iomem annotation is to be used together with pointers used
as iowrite32() parameter. For more details see [1] and [2].

This patch will remove the following sparse warnings ("make C=1"):
 * warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
 * warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
 * warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
