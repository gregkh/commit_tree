unix_diag: Fixup RQLEN extension report

While it's not too late fix the recently added RQLEN diag extension
to report rqlen and wqlen in the same way as TCP does.

I.e. for listening sockets the ack backlog length (which is the input
queue length for socket) in rqlen and the max ack backlog length in
wqlen, and what the CINQ/OUTQ ioctls do for established.
