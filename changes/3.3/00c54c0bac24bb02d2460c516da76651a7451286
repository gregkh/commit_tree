mm: page_cgroup: check page_cgroup arrays in lookup_page_cgroup() only when necessary

lookup_page_cgroup() is usually used only against pages that are used in
userspace.

The exception is the CONFIG_DEBUG_VM-only memcg check from the page
allocator: it can run on pages without page_cgroup descriptors allocated
when the pages are fed into the page allocator for the first time during
boot or memory hotplug.

Include the array check only when CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is set and save the
unnecessary check in production kernels.
