virtio: support unlocked queue kick

Based on patch by Christoph for virtio_blk speedup:

	Split virtqueue_kick to be able to do the actual notification
	outside the lock protecting the virtqueue.  This patch was
	originally done by Stefan Hajnoczi, but I can't find the
	original one anymore and had to recreated it from memory.
	Pointers to the original or corrections for the commit message
	are welcome.

Stefan's patch was here:

Third time's the charm!
