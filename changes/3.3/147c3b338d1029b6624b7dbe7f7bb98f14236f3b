mmc: esdhc: set the timeout to the max value

When accessing the card on some FSL platform boards (e.g p2020, p1010,
mpc8536), the following error is reported with the timeout value calculated:

mmc0: Got data interrupt 0x00000020 even though no data operation was
in progress.
mmc0: Got data interrupt 0x00000020 even though no data operation was
in progress.

So we skip the calculation of timeout and use the max value to fix it.
