PCI: ARM: convert pcibios_set_master() to a non-inlined function

This patch converts ARM's architecture-specific inlined
'pcibios_set_master()' routine to a non-inlined function.  This will
allow follow on patches to create a generic 'pcibios_set_master()'
function using the '__weak' attribute which can be used by all
architectures as a default which, if necessary, can then be over-
ridden by architecture-specific code.

Converting 'pci_bios_set_master()' to a non-inlined function will allow
ARM's 'pcibios_set_master()' implementation to remain architecture-
specific after the generic version is introduced and thus, not change
current behavior.

Note that ARM also has a non-inlined 'pcibios_set_master()' that is
used if CONFIG_PCI_HOST_ITE8152 is defined.  This patch does not
change any behavior here either.

No functional change.
