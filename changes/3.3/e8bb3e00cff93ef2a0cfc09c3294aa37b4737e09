powerpc/cpuidle: Handle power_save=off

This patch makes pseries_idle_driver not to be registered when
power_save=off kernel boot option is specified. The
cpuidle_disable variable used here is similar to
its usage on x86. If cpuidle_disable is set then
sysfs entries for cpuidle framework are not created
and the required drivers are not loaded.
