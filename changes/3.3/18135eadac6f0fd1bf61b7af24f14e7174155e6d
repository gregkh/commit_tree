OMAPDSS: APPLY: skip isr register and config for manual update displays

The mechanism to cache manager and overlay settings and configure them
into the HW registers in VSYNC is meant only for auto-update displays,
as it doesn't make sense (and doesn't work) for manual-update displays.

This patchs adds a check so that we skip the above for manual update
displays.
