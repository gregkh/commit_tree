mac80211: reduce station management complexity

Now that IBSS no longer needs to insert stations
from atomic context, we can get rid of all the
special cases for that, and even get rid of the
sta_lock (though it needs to stay as tim_lock.)

This makes the station management code much more
straight-forward.
