ARM: LPAE: Introduce the 3-level page table format definitions

This patch introduces the pgtable-3level*.h files with definitions
specific to the LPAE page table format (3 levels of page tables).

Each table is 4KB and has 512 64-bit entries. An entry can point to a
40-bit physical address. The young, write and exec software bits share
the corresponding hardware bits (negated). Other software bits use spare
bits in the PTE.

The patch also changes some variable types from unsigned long or int to
pteval_t or pgprot_t.
