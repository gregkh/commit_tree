TTY: serial, cleanup include file

There are some functions (uart_handle_dcd_change, _handle_cts_change,
_insert_char) which are big enough to not be inlined. So move them
from .h to .c. We need to export them so that modules can actually use
them.

They will be even bigger when we introduce tty refcounting to them.

While at it, cleanup the "Proud member of Uglyhacks'R'US". It means,
define uart_handle_sysrq_char only when SUPPORT_SYSRQ is set.
Otherwise define it as a macro. This is needed for some arm driver
where the second parameter is undefined if expanded.
