ARM: proc-*.S: place cpu_reset functions into .idmap.text section

The CPU reset functions disable the MMU and therefore must be executed
with an identity mapping in place.

This patch places the CPU reset functions into the .idmap.text section,
causing the idmap code to include them as part of the identity mapping.
