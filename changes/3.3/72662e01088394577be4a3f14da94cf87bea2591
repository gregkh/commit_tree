ARM: head.S: only include __turn_mmu_on in the initial identity mapping

__create_page_tables identity maps the region of memory from
__enable_mmu to the end of __turn_mmu_on.

In preparation for including __turn_mmu_on in the .idmap.text section,
this patch modifies the identity mapping so that it only includes the
__turn_mmu_on code.
