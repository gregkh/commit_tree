x86: Fix rflags in FAKE_STACK_FRAME

The x86_64 kernel pushes the fake kernel stack in
arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S:FAKE_STACK_FRAME, and
rflags register in it does not conform to the specification.

Although Intel's manual[1] says bit 1 of it shall be set to 1,
this bit is cleared to 0 on pushing the fake stack.

[1] Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual
    Vol.1 3-21 Figure 3-8. EFLAGS Register

If it is not on purpose, it is better to be fixed, because
it can lead some tools misunderstanding the stack frame. For example,
"crash" utility[2] actually detects it and warns you like
below:

       RIP: ffffffff8005dfa2  RSP: ffff8104ce0c7f58  RFLAGS: 00000200
       [...]

       bt: WARNING: possibly bogus exception frame
