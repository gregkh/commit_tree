MIPS/Perf-events: Remove pmu and event state checking in validate_event()

Why removing pmu checking:
Since 3.2-rc1, when arch level event init is called, the event is already
connected to its PMU. Also, validate_event() is _only_ called by
validate_group() in event init, so there is no need of checking or
temporarily assigning event pmu during validate_group().

Why removing event state checking:
Events could be created in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF (attr->disabled == 1), when
these events go through this checking, validate_group() does dummy work.
But we do need to do group scheduling emulation for them in event init.
Again, validate_event() is _only_ called by validate_group().
