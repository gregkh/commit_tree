powerpc: Fix RCU idle and hcall tracing

Tracepoints should not be called inside an rcu_idle_enter/rcu_idle_exit
region. Since pSeries calls H_CEDE in the idle loop, we were violating
this rule.

commit a7b152d5342c (powerpc: Tell RCU about idle after hcall tracing)
tried to work around it by delaying the rcu_idle_enter until after we
called the hcall tracepoint, but there are a number of issues with it.

The hcall tracepoint trampoline code is called conditionally when the
tracepoint is enabled. If the tracepoint is not enabled we never call
rcu_idle_enter. The idle_uses_rcu check was also done at compile time
which breaks multiplatform builds.

The simple fix is to avoid tracing H_CEDE and rely on other tracepoints
and the hypervisor dispatch trace log to work out if we called H_CEDE.

This fixes a hang during boot on pSeries.
