bnx2x: Fix Super-Isolate mode for BCM84833

The Super-Isolate mode comes to isolate the BCM84833 PHY from the
outside world.  Not doing it correctly, made link partner see the link
before the driver was loaded.

This patch also involves SPIROM version fixes since it is used to
determine whether the common init of the PHY was already executed, and
the common init of this PHY is partially responsible for setting the
Super-Isolate mode.
