x86, efi: Break up large initrd reads

The efi boot stub tries to read the entire initrd in 1 go, however
some efi implementations hang if too much if asked to read too much
data at the same time. After some experimentation I found out that my
asrock p67 board will hang if asked to read chunks of 4MiB, so use a
safe value.

elilo reads in chunks of 16KiB, but since that requires many read
calls I use a value of 1 MiB.  hpa suggested adding individual
blacklists for when systems are found where this value causes a crash.
