mm: compaction: introduce sync-light migration for use by compaction

This patch adds a lightweight sync migrate operation MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT
mode that avoids writing back pages to backing storage.  Async compaction
maps to MIGRATE_ASYNC while sync compaction maps to MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT.
For other migrate_pages users such as memory hotplug, MIGRATE_SYNC is
used.

This avoids sync compaction stalling for an excessive length of time,
particularly when copying files to a USB stick where there might be a
large number of dirty pages backed by a filesystem that does not support
->writepages.
