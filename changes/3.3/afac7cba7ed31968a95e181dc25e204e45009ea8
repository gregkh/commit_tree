vfs: more mnt_parent cleanups

a) mount --move is checking that ->mnt_parent is non-NULL before
looking if that parent happens to be shared; ->mnt_parent is never
NULL and it's not even an misspelled !mnt_has_parent()

b) pivot_root open-codes is_path_reachable(), poorly.

c) so does path_is_under(), while we are at it.
