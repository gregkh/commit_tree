ARM: SMP: use idmap_pgd for mapping MMU enable during secondary booting

The ARM SMP booting code allocates a temporary set of page tables
containing an identity mapping of the kernel image and provides this
to secondary CPUs for initial booting.

In reality, we only need to include the __turn_mmu_on function in the
identity mapping since the rest of the kernel is executing from virtual
addresses after this point.

This patch adds __turn_mmu_on to the .idmap.text section, allowing the
SMP booting code to use the idmap_pgd directly and not have to populate
its own set of page table.

As a result of this patch, we can make the identity_mapping_add function
static (since it is only used within mm/idmap.c) and also remove the
identity_mapping_del function. The identity map population is moved to
an early initcall so that it is setup in time for secondary CPU bringup.
