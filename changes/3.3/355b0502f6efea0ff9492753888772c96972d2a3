Revert "Staging: android: delete android drivers"

This reverts commit b0a0ccfad85b3657fe999805df65f5cfe634ab8a.

Turns out I was wrong, we want these in the tree.

Note, I've disabled the drivers from the build at the moment, so other
patches can be applied to fix some build issues due to internal api
changes since the code was removed from the tree.
