ARM: EXYNOS: Limit usage of pl330 device instance to non-dt build

The pl330 device instances and associated platform data is required only
for non-device-tree builds. With device tree enabled, the data about the

dt and non-dt platforms, an addditional check is added to ensure that
static amba device registrations is applicable to only non-dt platforms.
