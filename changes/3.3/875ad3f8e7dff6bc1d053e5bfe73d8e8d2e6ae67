SUNRPC: Fix machine creds in generic_create_cred and generic_match

- generic_create_cred needs to copy the '.principal' field.
- generic_match needs to ignore the groups and match on the '.principal'
  field.

This fixes an Oops that was introduced by commit 68c9715 (SUNRPC:
Clean up the RPCSEC_GSS service ticket requests)
