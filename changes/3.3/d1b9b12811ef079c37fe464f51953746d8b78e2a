powerpc: Add hugepage support to 64-bit tablewalk code for FSL_BOOK3E

Before hugetlb, at each level of the table, we test for
!0 to determine if we have a valid table entry.  With hugetlb, this
compare becomes:
        < 0 is a normal entry
        0 is an invalid entry
        > 0 is huge

This works because the hugepage code pulls the top bit off the entry
(which for non-huge entries always has the top bit set) as an
indicator that we have a hugepage.
