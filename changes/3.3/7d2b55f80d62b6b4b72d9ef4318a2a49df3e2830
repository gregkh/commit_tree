tcp: make is_dupack a parameter to tcp_fastretrans_alert()

Allow callers to decide whether an ACK is a duplicate ACK. This is a
prerequisite to allowing fastretrans_alert to be called from new
contexts, such as the no_queue and old_ack code paths, from which we
have extra info that tells us whether an ACK is a dupack.
