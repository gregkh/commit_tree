target: Change target_submit_cmd() to return void

Retval not very useful, and may even be harmful. Once submitted, fabrics
should expect a sense error if anything goes wrong. All fabrics checking
of this retval are useless or broken:

fc checks it just to emit more debug output.
ib_srpt trickles retval up, then it is ignored.
qla2xxx trickles it up, which then causes a bug because the abort goto
in qla_target.c thinks cmd hasn't been sent to target.

Just returning nothing is best.
