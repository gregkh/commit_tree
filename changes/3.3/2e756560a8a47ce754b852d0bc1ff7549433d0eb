brcm80211: smac: change from pci device driver to bcma device driver

A new bus driver called "bcma" has been introduced into the kernel tree
which considers the Broadcom AMBA chip interconnect as a bus. Each core in
the chip is a bcma device. This commit changes brcms_mac80211.c into
a bcma device driver.
