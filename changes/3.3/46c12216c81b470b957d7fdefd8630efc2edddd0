cpufreq: OMAP: Add SMP support for OMAP4+

On OMAP SMP configuartion, both processors share the voltage
and clock. So both CPUs needs to be scaled together and hence
needs software co-ordination.

Also, update lpj with reference value to avoid progressive error.

Adjust _both_ the per-cpu loops_per_jiffy and global lpj. Calibrate
them with with reference to the initial values to avoid a
progressively bigger and bigger error in the value over time.

While at this, re-use the notifiers for UP/SMP since on UP machine or
UP_ON_SMP policy->cpus mask would contain only the boot CPU.

Based on initial SMP support by Santosh Shilimkar.
