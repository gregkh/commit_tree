mm: bootmem: try harder to free pages in bulk

The loop that frees pages to the page allocator while bootstrapping tries
to free higher-order blocks only when the starting address is aligned to
that block size.  Otherwise it will free all pages on that node
one-by-one.

Change it to free individual pages up to the first aligned block and then
try higher-order frees from there.
