KVM: Refactor and simplify kvm_dev_ioctl_get_supported_cpuid

This patch cleans and simplifies kvm_dev_ioctl_get_supported_cpuid by using a table
instead of duplicating code as Avi suggested.

This patch also fixes a bug where kvm_dev_ioctl_get_supported_cpuid would return
-E2BIG when amount of entries passed was just right.
