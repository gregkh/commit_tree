kmemleak: Disable early logging when kmemleak is off by default

Commit b6693005 (kmemleak: When the early log buffer is exceeded, report
the actual number) deferred the disabling of the early logging to
kmemleak_init(). However, when CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_DEFAULT_OFF=y, the
early logging was no longer disabled causing __init kmemleak functions
to be called even after the kernel freed the init memory. This patch
disables the early logging during kmemleak_init() if kmemleak is left
disabled.
