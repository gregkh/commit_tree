c/r: procfs: add start_data, end_data, start_brk members to /proc/$pid/stat v4

The mm->start_code/end_code, mm->start_data/end_data, mm->start_brk are
involved into calculation of program text/data segment sizes (which might
be seen in /proc/<pid>/statm) and into brk() call final address.

For restore we need to know all these values.  While
mm->start_code/end_code already present in /proc/$pid/stat, the rest
members are not, so this patch brings them in.

The restore procedure of these members is addressed in another patch using
prctl().
