iommu/intel: Implement iommu_device_group

We generally have BDF granularity for devices, so we just need
to make sure devices aren't hidden behind PCIe-to-PCI bridges.
We can then make up a group number that's simply the concatenated
seg|bus|dev|fn so we don't have to track them (not that users
should depend on that).
