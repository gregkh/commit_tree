TTY: serial, use tty_port_close_start helper

After the previous patches, the code is almost identical. There are
few differences in the helper code:
1) flush_buffer when flow_stopped
   * when a user doesn't care about the data, delete it anyways
2) ASYNCB_INITIALIZED test before wait_until_sent_from
   * obviously, there is nothing to wait for if the port is dead
3) drain_delay wait
   * we don't set drain_delay

So we can use the helper now. It indeed removes a bunch of duplicated
code.
