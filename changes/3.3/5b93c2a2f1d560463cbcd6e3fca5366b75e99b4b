staging: vme: remove vme_add_bus() and vme_remove_bus()

The functions vme_add_bus() and vme_remove_bus() were only being used
in the vme_register_bridge() and vme_unregister_bridge() functions
respectively. This patch gets rid of them and moves their code to
vme_register_bridge() and vme_unregister_bridge().
