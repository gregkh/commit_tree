ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: register dss hwmods after dss_core

dss_core has to be initialized before any other DSS hwmod. Currently
this is broken as dss_core is listed in chip/revision specific hwmod
lists while other DSS hwmods are listed in common list which is
registered first.

This patch moves DSS hwmods (except for dss_core) to the separate list
which is registered last to ensure that dss_core is already registered.

This solves the problem with BUG() in L3 interrupt handler on boards
with DSS enabled in bootloader.

The long-term fix to this is to ensure modules are set up in dependency
order in the hwmod core code.
