iwl3945: fix possible il->txq NULL pointer dereference in delayed works

On il3945_down procedure we free tx queue data and nullify il->txq
pointer. After that we drop mutex and then cancel delayed works. There
is possibility, that after drooping mutex and before the cancel, some
delayed work will start and crash while trying to send commands to
the device. For example, here is reported crash in
il3945_bg_reg_txpower_periodic():

Patch fix problem by adding il->txq check on works that send commands,
hence utilize tx queue.
