tracing: Have stack_tracer use a separate list of functions

The stack_tracer is used to look at every function and check
if the current stack is bigger than the last recorded max stack size.
When a new max is found, then it saves that stack off.

Currently the stack tracer is limited by the global_ops of
the function tracer. As the stack tracer has nothing to do with
the ftrace function tracer, except that it uses it as its internal
engine, the stack tracer should have its own list.

A new file is added to the tracing debugfs directory called:

  stack_trace_filter

that can be used to select which functions you want to check the stack
on.
