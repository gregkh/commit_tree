block, cfq: remove delayed unlink

Now that all cic's are immediately unlinked from both ioc and queue,
lazy dropping from lookup path and trimming on elevator unregister are
unnecessary.  Kill them and remove now unused elevator_ops->trim().

This also leaves call_for_each_cic() without any user.  Removed.
