powerpc/cpuidle: cpuidle driver for pSeries

This patch implements a back-end cpuidle driver for pSeries
based on pseries_dedicated_idle_loop and pseries_shared_idle_loop
routines.  The driver is built only if CONFIG_CPU_IDLE is set. This
cpuidle driver uses global registration of idle states and
not per-cpu.
