MFD: OMAP: USB: Runtime PM support

The usbhs core driver does not enable/disable the interface and
functional clocks directly, These clocks are handled by runtime pm,
hence instead of the clock enable/disable, the runtime pm APIS are
used. however,the optional clocks and port clocks are handled by
the usbhs core.
