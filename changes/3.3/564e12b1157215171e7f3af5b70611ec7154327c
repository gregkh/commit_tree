GFS2: decouple quota allocations from block allocations

This patch separates the code pertaining to allocations into two
parts: quota-related information and block reservations.
This patch also moves all the block reservation structure allocations to
function gfs2_inplace_reserve to simplify the code, and moves
the frees to function gfs2_inplace_release.
