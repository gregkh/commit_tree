Btrfs: fix reservations in btrfs_page_mkwrite

Josef fixed btrfs_page_mkwrite to properly release reserved
extents if there was an error.  But if we fail to get a reservation
and we fail to dirty the inode (for ENOSPC reasons), we'll end up
trying to release a reservation we never had.

This makes sure we only release if we were able to reserve.
