wl12xx: replace all remaining wl->vif references

wl->vif is appropriate only when a single vif is being used.
Instead, pass wlvif as parameter or iterate through all
the vifs (e.g. when a global configuration was changed)

Leave wl->vif only to determine whether a vif was already
added (this check will be removed as well after both the
driver and fw will support multiple vifs)
