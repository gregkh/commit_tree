ASoC: Move SigmaDSP firmware loader to ASoC

It has been pointed out previously, that the firmware subsystem is not the right
place for the SigmaDSP firmware loader. Furthermore the SigmaDSP is currently
only used in audio products and we are aiming for better integration into the
ASoC framework in the future, with support for ALSA controls for firmware
parameters and support dynamic power management as well. So the natural choice
for the SigmaDSP firmware loader is the ASoC subsystem.
