brcm80211: smac: register with bcma for specific 802.11 core revisions

The brcmsmac driver has been verified on chipsets that were supported
when it was a pci device driver, ie. bcm4313, bcm43224, and bcm43225.
This patch restricts the driver to 802.11 core revisions that are found
in these chipsets.
