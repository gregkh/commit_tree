ftrace: Decouple hash items from showing filtered functions

The set_ftrace_filter shows "hashed" functions, which are functions
that are added with operations to them (like traceon and traceoff).

As other subsystems may be able to show what functions they are
using for function tracing, the hash items should no longer
be shown just because the FILTER flag is set. As they have nothing
to do with other subsystems filters.
