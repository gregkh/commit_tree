Btrfs: add basic infrastructure for selective balancing

This allows to have a separate set of filters for each chunk type
(data,meta,sys).  The code however is generic and switch on chunk type
is only done once.

This commit also adds a type filter: it allows to balance for example
meta and system chunks w/o touching data ones.
