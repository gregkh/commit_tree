ARM: 7290/1: vmlinux.lds.S: align the exception fixup table to a 4-byte boundary

The exception fixup table is currently aligned to a 32-byte boundary.
Whilst this won't cause any problems, the exception_table_entry
structures contain only a pair of unsigned longs, so 4-byte alignment
is all that is required. If the table was walked from start to end,
cacheline alignment may bring some performance benefits, but since a
binary search is used, the access pattern is random and will not benefit
from a stricter alignment.
