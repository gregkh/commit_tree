UBI: fix debugging messages

Patch ab50ff684707031ed4bad2fdd313208ae392e5bb broke UBI debugging messages:
before that commit when UBI debugging was enabled, users saw few useful
debugging messages after attaching an MTD device. However, that patch turned
'dbg_msg()' into 'pr_debug()', so to enable the debugging messages users have
to enable them first via /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control, which is
very impractical.

This commit makes 'dbg_msg()' to use 'printk()' instead of 'pr_debug()', just
as it was before the breakage.
