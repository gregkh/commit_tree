serial: sh-sci: Handle GPIO function requests.

This adds initial support for requesting the various GPIO functions
necessary for certain ports. This just plugs in dumb request/free logic,
but serves as a building block for migrating off of the ->init_pins mess
to a wholly gpiolib backed solution (primarily parts with external
RTS/CTS pins, but will also allow us to clean up RXD pin testing).
