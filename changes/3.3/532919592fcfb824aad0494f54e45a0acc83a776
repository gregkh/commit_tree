powerpc/85xx: Rework MPC8572DS device tree

Utilize new split between board & SoC, and new SoC device trees split
into pre & post utilizing 'template' includes for SoC IP blocks.

Other changes include:

* Moved to specifying interrupt-parent for mpic at root
* Moved to 4-cell mpic interrupt cells to support MPIC timers
* Removed CPU properties setup by u-boot to match other .dts
* Reworked PCIe nodes to allow supportin IRQs for controller (errors) and
  moved PCI device IRQs down to virtual bridge level
* Moved mdio nodes up one level instead of under tsec nodes
* Added GPIO controller node to MPC8572 SoC template
* Dropping "fsl,mpc8572-IP..." from compatibles for standard blocks
