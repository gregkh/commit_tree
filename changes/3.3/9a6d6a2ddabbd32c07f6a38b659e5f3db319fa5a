ata: make ata port as parent device of scsi host

Currently, the device tree of ata port and scsi host looks as below,

        /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2    (ahci controller)
        |-- ata1                                (ata port)
        |-- host0                               (scsi host)
           |-- target0:0:0                      (scsi target)
               |-- 0:0:0:0                      (disk)

This patch makes ata port as parent device of scsi host, then it becomes

        /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2    (ahci controller)
        |-- ata1                                (ata port)
            |-- host0                           (scsi host)
                |-- target0:0:0                 (scsi target)
                    |-- 0:0:0:0                 (disk)

With this change, the ata port runtime PM is easier.
For example, the ata port runtime suspend will happen as,

disk suspend --> scsi target suspend --> scsi host suspend --> ata port
suspend.
