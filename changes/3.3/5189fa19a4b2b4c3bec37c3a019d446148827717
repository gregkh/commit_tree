regset: Return -EFAULT, not -EIO, on host-side memory fault

There is only one error code to return for a bad user-space buffer
pointer passed to a system call in the same address space as the
system call is executed, and that is EFAULT.  Furthermore, the
low-level access routines, which catch most of the faults, return
EFAULT already.
