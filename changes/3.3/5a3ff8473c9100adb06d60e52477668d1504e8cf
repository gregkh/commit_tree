    ARM: OMAP4: PRM: use PRCM interrupt handler

introduced the PRCM interrupt handler and thus the need
for 64 more interrupts. Since SPARSE_IRQ is still not fully
functional on OMAP, the NR_IRQS needs to be updated to avoid
the failure that happen during irq_alloc_descs call inside
the PRCM driver:

[    0.208221] PRCM: failed to allocate irq descs: -12

Later the mux framework is then unable to request an IRQ from
the PRCM interrupt handler.

[    1.802795] mux: Failed to setup hwmod io irq -22

Fix that by adding 64 more interrupts for OMAP2PLUS config.
