cgroup: make sure memcg margin is 0 when over limit

For the memcg sock code, we'll need to register allocations
that are temporarily over limit. Let's make sure that margin
is 0 in this case.

I am keeping this as a separate patch, so that if any weirdness
interaction appears in the future, we can now exactly what caused
it.
