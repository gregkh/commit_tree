ARM: OMAP: fix MMC2 loopback clock handling

Currently MMC2 setup code can only enable loopback clock and
relies on reset value for boards that need to have it disabled.
This causes a problem with certain bootloaders that always enable
that clock, resulting with unwanted bootloader dependencies.

Fix this by making it disable the clock if board data says so.
