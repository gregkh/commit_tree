lib: devres: add convenience function to remap a resource

Almost every platform_driver does the three steps get_resource,
request_mem_region, ioremap. This does not only lead to a lot of code
duplication, but also a huge number of similar error strings and
inconsistent error codes on failure. So, introduce a helper function
which simplifies remapping a resource and make it hard to do something
wrong and add documentation for it.
