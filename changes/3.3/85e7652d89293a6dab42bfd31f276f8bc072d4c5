ASoC: Constify snd_soc_dai_ops structs

Commit 1ee46ebd("ASoC: Make the DAI ops constant in the DAI structure")
introduced the possibility to have constant DAI ops structures, yet this is
barley used in both existing drivers and also new drivers being submitted,
although none of them modifies its DAI ops structure. The later is not
surprising since existing drivers are often used as templates for new drivers.
So this patch just constifies all existing snd_soc_dai_ops structs to eliminate
the issue altogether.

The patch was generated with the following coccinelle semantic patch:
// <smpl>
@@
identifier ops;
@@
-struct snd_soc_dai_ops ops =
+const struct snd_soc_dai_ops ops =
{ ... };
// </smpl>
