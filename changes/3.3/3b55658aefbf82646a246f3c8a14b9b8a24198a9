ARM: SMP: Refactor Kconfig to be more maintainable

Making SMP depend on (huge list of MACH_ and ARCH_ configs) is
bothersome to maintain and likely to lead to merge conflicts.

This patch moves the knowledge of which platforms are SMP-capable
to the individual machines.  To enable this, a new HAVE_SMP config
option is introduced to allow machines to indicate that they can
run in a SMP configuration.
