Drivers:hv: Fix a bug in vmbus_driver_unregister()

The function vmbus_exists() was introduced recently to deal with cases where
the vmbus driver failed to initialize and yet other Hyper-V drivers attempted
to register with the vmbus bus driver. This patch introduced a bug where
vmbus_driver_unregister() would fail to unregister the driver. This patch
fixes the problem.
