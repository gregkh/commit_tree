mm: vmscan: check if we isolated a compound page during lumpy scan

Properly take into account if we isolated a compound page during the lumpy
scan in reclaim and skip over the tail pages when encountered.  This
corrects the values given to the tracepoint for number of lumpy pages
isolated and will avoid breaking the loop early if compound pages smaller
than the requested allocation size are requested.
