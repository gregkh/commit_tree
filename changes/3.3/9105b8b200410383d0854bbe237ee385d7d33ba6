[media] staging: lirc_serial: Fix init/exit order

Currently the module init function registers a platform_device and
only then allocates its IRQ and I/O region.  This allows allocation to
race with the device's suspend() function.  Instead, allocate
resources in the platform driver's probe() function and free them in
the remove() function.

The module exit function removes the platform device before the
character device that provides access to it.  Change it to reverse the
order of initialisation.
