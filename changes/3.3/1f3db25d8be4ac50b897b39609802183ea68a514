dm thin metadata: remove incorrect close_device on creation error paths

The __open_device() error paths in __create_thin() and __create_snap()
incorrectly call __close_device() even if td was not initialized by
__open_device().  Remove this.

Also document __open_device() return values, remove a redundant
td->changed = 1 in __create_thin(), and insert an additional
safeguard against creating an already-existing device.
