PM / Sleep: Replace mutex_[un]lock(&pm_mutex) with [un]lock_system_sleep()

Using [un]lock_system_sleep() is safer than directly using mutex_[un]lock()
on 'pm_mutex', since the latter could lead to freezing failures. Hence convert
all the present users of mutex_[un]lock(&pm_mutex) to use these safe APIs
instead.
