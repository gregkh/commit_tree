rcu: Control rcutorture startup from kernel boot parameters

Currently, if rcutorture is built into the kernel, it must be manually
started or started from an init script.  This is inconvenient for
automated KVM testing, where it is good to be able to fully control
rcutorture execution from the kernel parameters.  This patch therefore
adds a module parameter named "rcutorture_runnable" that defaults
to zero ("don't start automatically"), but which can be set to one
to cause rcutorture to start up immediately during boot.
