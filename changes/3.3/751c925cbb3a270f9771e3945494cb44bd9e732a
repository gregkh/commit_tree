spi/omap: call pm_runtime_disable in error path and remove

omap mcspi probe() doesnt call pm_runtime  disable functions
in case of failure. remove() doesnt call pm_runtime disable. This could
lead to warnings as below on subsequent insmod.

~# insmod spi-omap2-mcspi.ko
[  255.383671] omap2_mcspi omap2_mcspi.1: Unbalanced pm_runtime_enable!
...

This patch adds the pm_runtime disable() at appropriate stages.
