PM / Sleep: Use the freezer_count() functions in [un]lock_system_sleep() APIs

Now that freezer_count() and freezer_do_not_count() don't have the restriction
that they are effective only when called by userspace processes, use
them in lock_system_sleep() and unlock_system_sleep() instead of open-coding
their parts.
