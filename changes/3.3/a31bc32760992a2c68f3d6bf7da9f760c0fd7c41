x86, x2apic: Allow "nox2apic" to disable x2apic mode setup by BIOS

Currently "nox2apic" boot parameter was not enabling x2apic mode if the cpu,
kernel are all capable of enabling x2apic mode and the OS handover
happened in xapic mode.

However If the bios enabled x2apic prior to OS handover, using "nox2apic"
boot parameter had no effect.

If the boot cpu's apicid is < 255, enable "nox2apic" boot parameter to
disable the x2apic mode setup by the bios. This will enable the kernel to
fallback to xapic mode and bringup only the cpu's which has apic-id < 255.

-v2: fix patch error and two compiling warning
	make disable_x2apic to be __init
