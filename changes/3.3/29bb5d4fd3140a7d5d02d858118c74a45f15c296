driver-core: cpu: fix kobject warning when hotplugging a cpu

Due to the sysdev conversion to struct device, the cpu objects get
reused when adding a cpu after offlining it, which causes a big warning
that the kobject portion is not properly initialized.

So clear out the object before we register it again, so all is quiet.
