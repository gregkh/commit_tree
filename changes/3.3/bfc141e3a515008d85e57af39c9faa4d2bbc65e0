ARM: OMAP4: hwmod: Don't wait for the idle status if modulemode is not supported

If the module does not have any modulemode, the _disable_module function
will do nothing. There is then no point waiting for a idle status change.

It will remove the following warnings.

Note: For such module, the state is managed automatically by HW according
to clock domain transition. It is then not possible to wait for idle even
later in the _idle function since the status will change at clock domain
boundary.
