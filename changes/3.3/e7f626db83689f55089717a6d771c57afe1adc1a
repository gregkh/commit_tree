ARM: 7207/1: Use generic ARM instruction set condition code checks for nwfpe.

This patch changes the nwfpe implementation to use the new generic
ARM instruction set condition code checks, rather than a local
implementation. It also removes the existing condition code checking,
which has been used for the generic support (in kernel/opcodes.{ch}).

This code has not been tested beyond building, linking and booting.
