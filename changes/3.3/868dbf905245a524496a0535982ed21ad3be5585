ARM: 7295/1: cortex-a7: move proc_info out of !CONFIG_ARM_LPAE block

The merging of commits 1b6ba46b ("ARM: LPAE: MMU setup for the 3-level
page table format") and b4244738 ("ARM: 7202/1: Add Cortex-A7 proc info")
during the merge window ended up putting the Cortex-A7 proc_info into a
code block guarded by !CONFIG_ARM_LPAE. This makes Cortex-A7 platforms
unbootable when LPAE is enabled.

This patch moves the proc_info structure for Cortex-A7 outside of the
guarded block.
