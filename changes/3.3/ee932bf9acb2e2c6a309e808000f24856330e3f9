Move Logitech Harmony 900 from cdc_ether to zaurus

In the current kernel implementation, the Logitech Harmony 900 remote
control is matched to the cdc_ether driver through the generic
USB_CDC_SUBCLASS_MDLM entry.  However, this device appears to be of the
pseudo-MDLM (Belcarra) type, rather than the standard one.  This patch
blacklists the Harmony 900 from the cdc_ether driver and whitelists it for
the pseudo-MDLM driver in zaurus.
