ARM: 7325/1: fix v7 boot with lockdep enabled

Bootup with lockdep enabled has been broken on v7 since b46c0f74657d
("ARM: 7321/1: cache-v7: Disable preemption when reading CCSIDR").

This is because v7_setup (which is called very early during boot) calls
v7_flush_dcache_all, and the save_and_disable_irqs added by that patch
ends up attempting to call into lockdep C code (trace_hardirqs_off())
when we are in no position to execute it (no stack, MMU off).

Fix this by using a notrace variant of save_and_disable_irqs.  The code
already uses the notrace variant of restore_irqs.
