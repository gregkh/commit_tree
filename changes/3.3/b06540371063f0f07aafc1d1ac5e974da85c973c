ARM: orion: Fix Orion5x GPIO regression from MPP cleanup

Patchset "ARM: orion: Refactor the MPP code common in the orion
platform" broke at least Orion5x based platforms. These platforms have
pins configured as GPIO when the selector is not 0x0. However the
common code assumes the selector is always 0x0 for a GPIO lines. It
then ignores the GPIO bits in the MPP definitions, resulting in that
Orion5x machines cannot correctly configure there GPIO lines.

The Fix removes the assumption that the selector is always 0x0.
In order that none GPIO configurations are correctly blocked,
Kirkwood and mv78xx0 MPP definitions are corrected to only set the
GPIO bits for GPIO configurations.

This third version, which does not contain any whitespace changes,
and is rebased on v3.3-rc2.
