OMAPDSS: hide manager's enable/disable()

omap_overlay_manager struct contains enable() and disable() functions.
However, these are only meant to be used from inside omapdss, and thus
it's bad to expose the functions.

This patch adds dss_mgr_enable() and dss_mgr_disable() functions to
apply.c, which handle enabling and disabling the output.
