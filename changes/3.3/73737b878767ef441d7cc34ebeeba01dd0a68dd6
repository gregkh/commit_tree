drivers/rtc/rtc-r9701.c: fix crash in r9701_remove()

If probing the RTC didn't succeed due to failed RTC register access, the
RTC device will be unregistered.  Then, when removing the module
r9701_remove() causes a kernel crash while trying to unregister a not
registered RTC device.  Fix this by doing RTC register access test before
RTC device registration.
