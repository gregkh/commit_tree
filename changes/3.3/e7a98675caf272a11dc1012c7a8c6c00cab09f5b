powerpc/mpic: Save computed phys_addr for board-specific code

The MPIC code can already perform an automatic OF address translation
step as part of mpic_alloc(), but several boards need to use that base
address when they perform mpic_assign_isu().

The easiest solution is to save the computed physical address into the
"struct mpic" for later use by the board code.
