x86: Add NumaChip support

Adds support for Numascale NumaChip large-SMP systems. It is
needed to enable the booting of more than ~168 cores.

v2:
 - [Steffen] enumerate only accessible northbridges
 - [Daniel] rediffed and validated against 3.1-rc10

v3:
 - [Daniel] use x86_init core numbering override
 - [Daniel] cleanups as per feedback

v4:
 - [Daniel] use updated x86_cpuinit override

v5:
 - drop disabling interrupts locally, as ISR write is atomic; drop delay
 - added read-mostly annotations where appropriate
 - require CONFIG_SMP, so drop conditional path

Workload tested on 96 cores/16 sockets.
