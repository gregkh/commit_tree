ARM: mach-shmobile: r8a7779 SMP support V3

This patch contains r8a7779 SMP support V3 - now including
CPU hotplug offine and online support. The r8a7779 power
domain code is tied together with SMP glue code which allows
us to control the power domains via CPU hotplug.

At this point the kernel boots with the 4 Cortex-A9 cores in
SMP mode and all CPU cores except CPU0 can be hotplugged.

The code in platsmp.c is quite far from pretty, but it is
kept like that intentionally to avoid creating layers of
code that will go away in the near future anyway. The code
needs to be updated when some per-SoC handling code will be
added to the ARM architecture, see the following patch for
more information:
 "[RFC PATCH 0/3] Per SoC descriptor"
