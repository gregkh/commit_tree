enable virtio_net to return bus_info in ethtool -i consistent with emulated NICs

Add a new .bus_name to virtio_config_ops then modify virtio_net to
call through to it in an ethtool .get_drvinfo routine to report
bus_info in ethtool -i output which is consistent with other
emulated NICs and the output of lspci.
