mtd: tests: stresstest: bail out if device has not enough eraseblocks

stresstest needs at least two eraseblocks. Bail out gracefully if that
condition is not met. Fixes the following 'division by zero' OOPS:

[  619.100000] mtd_stresstest: MTD device size 131072, eraseblock size 131072, page size 2048, count of eraseblocks 1, pages per eraseblock 64, OOB size 64
[  619.120000] mtd_stresstest: scanning for bad eraseblocks
[  619.120000] mtd_stresstest: scanned 1 eraseblocks, 0 are bad
[  619.130000] mtd_stresstest: doing operations
[  619.130000] mtd_stresstest: 0 operations done
[  619.140000] Division by zero in kernel.
...

        /* Read or write up 2 eraseblocks at a time - hence 'ebcnt - 1' */
        eb %= (ebcnt - 1);
