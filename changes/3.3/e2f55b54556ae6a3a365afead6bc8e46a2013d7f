video: s3c-fb: Don't keep device runtime active when open

Allow the controller to be runtime suspended when the screen is blanked
by not taking a runtime reference while the device is open. This allows
greater system wide power savings when used with a standard application
layer and ensures that the screen does not blank unless requested.
