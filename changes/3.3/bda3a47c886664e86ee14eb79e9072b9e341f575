at_hdmac: bugfix for enabling channel irq

commit 463894705e4089d0ff69e7d877312d496ac70e5b deleted redundant
chan_id and chancnt initialization in dma drivers as this is done
in dma_async_device_register().

However, atc_enable_irq() relied on chan_id set before registering
the device, what left only channel 0 functional for this driver.

This patch introduces atc_enable/disable_chan_irq() as a variant
of atc_enable/disable_irq() with the channel as explicit argument.
