ARM: at91: fix at91rm9200 soc subtype handling

Currently setting it to PQFP changes subtype to BGA as subtypes are
swapped in at91rm9200_set_type().

Wrong subtype causes GPIO bank D not to work at all.

After this fix, subtype is still set as unknown. But board code should
fill it in with proper value. Another information is thus printed.

Bug discovery and first implementation made by Veli-Pekka Peltola.
