usb: dwc3: workaround: U1/U2 -> U0 transiton

RTL revisions <1.83a have an issue where, depending
on the link partner, the USB link might do multiple
entry/exit of low power states before a transfer
takes place causing degraded throughput.

The suggested workaround is to clear bits
12:9 of DCTL register if we see a transition
from U1|U2 to U0 and only re-enable that on
a transfer complete IRQ and we have no pending
transfers on any of the enabled endpoints.
