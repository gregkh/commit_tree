usb: musb: fix pm_runtime mismatch

In musb_init_controller() there's a pm_runtime_put(), but there's no
pm_runtime_get(), which creates a mismatch that causes the driver to
sleep when it shouldn't.

This was introduced in 7acc619[1], but it wasn't triggered in my setup
until 18a2689[2] was merged to Linus' branch at point df0914[3]. IOW;
when PM is working as it was supposed to.

However, it seems most of the time this is used in a way that keeps the
counter above 0, so nobody noticed. Also, it seems to depend on the
configuration used in versions before 3.1, but not later (or in it).

I found the problem by loading isp1704_charger before any usb gadgets:

All versions after 2.6.39 are affected.

[1] usb: musb: Idle path retention and offmode support for OMAP3
[2] OMAP2+: musb: hwmod adaptation for musb registration
[3] Merge branch 'omap-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tmlind/linux-omap-2.6
