Staging: iio/accel: Changed data type of mask in store_measurement_mode() to u8

In sca3000_store_measurement_mode() we parse a value from a string
buffer via kstrtou8, and store the parsed value into a u8 after
and-ing it with mask.

As we are only interested in the lowest two bits here and mask is
initialized with a fixed value 0x03, mask may as well be a u8.
