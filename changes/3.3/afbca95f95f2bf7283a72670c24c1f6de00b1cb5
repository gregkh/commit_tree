libertas: clean up scan thread handling

The libertas scan thread expects priv->scan_req to be non-NULL.  In theory,
it should always be set.  In practice, we've seen the following oops:

While I've not found a smoking gun, there are two places that raised red flags
for me.  The first is in _internal_start_scan, when we queue up a scan; we
first queue the worker, and then set priv->scan_req.  There's theoretically
a 50mS delay which should be plenty, but doing things that way just seems
racy (and not in the good way).

The second is in the scan worker thread itself.  Depending on the state of
priv->scan_channel, we cancel pending scan runs and then requeue a run in
300mS.  We then send the scan command down to the hardware, sleep, and if
we get scan results for all the desired channels, we set priv->scan_req to
NULL.  However, it that's happened in less than 300mS, what happens with
the pending scan run?

This patch addresses both of those concerns.  With the patch applied, we
have not seen the oops in the past two weeks.
