batman-adv: create a common substructure for tt_global/local_entry

Several functions in the translation table management code assume that the
tt_global_entry and tt_local_entry structures have the same initial fields such
as 'addr' and 'hash_entry'. To improve the code readability and to avoid
mistakes in later changes, a common substructure that substitute the shared
fields has been introduced (struct tt_common_entry).

Thanks to this modification, it has also been possible to slightly reduce the
code length by merging some functions like compare_ltt/gtt() and
tt_local/global_hash_find()
