[media] m5mols: Add support for the system initialization interrupt

The M-5MOLS internal controller's initialization time depends on the
hardware and firmware revision. Currently the driver just waits for
worst case time period, after applying the voltage supplies, for
the device to be ready. The M-5MOLS supports "System initialization"
interrupt which is triggered after the controller finished booting.
So use this interrupt to optimize the initialization sequence.

After the voltage supplies are applied the I2C communication will
fail, until the internal controller initializes to Flash Writer
state. For the period when the I2C is not accessible use the
isp_ready flag to suppress the error logs.
