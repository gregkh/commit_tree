SCSI, pmcraid: Fix spelling error in a pmcraid_err() call

There's a mistake in one of the pmcraid_err() calls in
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c - 'failed' is misspelled as 'faile'. This patch
fixes that error.

PS. This patch is generated on top of my previous one "[PATCH] SCSI,
pmcraid: Fix kmalloc() argument order in pmcraid_chr_ioctl()".
