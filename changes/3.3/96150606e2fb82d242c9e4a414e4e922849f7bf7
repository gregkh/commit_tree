logfs: update page reference count for pined pages

LogFS sets PG_private flag to indicate a pined page. We assumed that
marking a page as private is enough to ensure its existence. But
instead it is necessary to hold a reference count to the page.

The change resolves the following BUG

BUG: Bad page state in process flush-253:16  pfn:6a6d0
page flags: 0x100000000000808(uptodate|private)
