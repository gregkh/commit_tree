tipc: Optimize detection of duplicate media registration

Streamlines the detection of an attempt to register a TIPC media structure
using an already registered name or type identifier. The revised logic now
reuses an existing routine to detect an existing name and no longer
unnecessarily manipulates the media type counter during an unsuccessful
registration attempt.
