ARM: stop: execute platform callback from cpu_stop code

Sending IPI_CPU_STOP to a CPU causes it to execute a busy cpu_relax
loop forever. This makes it impossible to kexec successfully on an SMP
system since the secondary CPUs do not reset.

This patch adds a callback to platform_cpu_kill, defined when
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y, from the ipi_cpu_stop handling code. This function
currently just returns 1 on all platforms that define it but allows them
to do something more sophisticated in the future.
