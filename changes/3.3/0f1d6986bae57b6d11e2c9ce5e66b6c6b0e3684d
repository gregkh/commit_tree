PM / Domains: Fix build for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP unset

Some callback functions defined in drivers/base/power/domain.c are
only necessary if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is set and they call some other
functions that are only available in that case.  For this reason,
they should not be compiled at all when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not set.
