drm/ttm: merge ttm_backend and ttm_tt V5

ttm_backend will only exist with a ttm_tt, and ttm_tt
will only be of interest when bound to a backend. Merge them
to avoid code and data duplication.

V2 Rebase on top of memory accounting overhaul
V3 Rebase on top of more memory accounting changes
V4 Rebase on top of no memory account changes (where/when is my
   delorean when i need it ?)
V5 make sure ttm is unbound before destroying, change commit
   message on suggestion from Tormod Volden
