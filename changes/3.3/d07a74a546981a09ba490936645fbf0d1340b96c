dmaengine: fix missing 'cnt' in ?: in dmatest

Hi,
  On the latest tree my compiler has started giving the warning:

drivers/dma/dmatest.c:575:28: warning: the omitted middle operand in ?: will always be ?true?, suggest explicit middle operand [-Wparentheses]

The following patch fixes the missing middle clause with the same
fix that Nicolas Ferre used in the similar clauses.
(There seems to have been a race between him fixing that and
the extra clause going in a little later).

I don't actually know the dmatest code/structures, nor do I own
any hardware to test it on (assuming it needs a DMA engine);
 but this patch builds, the existing code is almost certainly
wrong and the fix is the same as the corresponding lines above it.

(WTH is x=y?:z legal C anyway?)
