tipc: Enable use by containers having their own network namespace

Permits a Linux container to use TIPC sockets even when it has its own
network namespace defined by removing the check that prohibits such use.
This makes it possible for users who wish to isolate their container
network traffic from normal network traffic to utilize TIPC.
