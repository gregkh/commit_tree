PM / Domains: Make it possible to use per-device domain callbacks

The current generic PM domains code requires that the same .stop(),
.start() and .active_wakeup() device callback routines be used for
all devices in the given domain, which is inflexible and may not
cover some specific use cases.  For this reason, make it possible to
use device specific .start()/.stop() and .active_wakeup() callback
routines by adding corresponding callback pointers to struct
generic_pm_domain_data.  Add a new helper routine,
pm_genpd_register_callbacks(), that can be used to populate
the new per-device callback pointers.

Modify the shmobile's power domains code to allow drivers to add
their own code to be run during the device stop and start operations
with the help of the new callback pointers.
