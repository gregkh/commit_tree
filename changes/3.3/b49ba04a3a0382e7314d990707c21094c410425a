iwlwifi: fix PCI-E transport "inta" race

When an interrupt comes in, we read the reason
bits and collect them into "trans_pcie->inta".
This happens with the spinlock held. However,
there's a bug resetting this variable -- that
happens after the spinlock has been released.
This means that it is possible for interrupts
to be missed if the reset happens after some
other interrupt reasons were already added to
the variable.

I found this by code inspection, looking for a
reason that we sometimes see random commands
time out. It seems possible that this causes
such behaviour, but I can't say for sure right
now since it happens extremely infrequently on
my test systems.
