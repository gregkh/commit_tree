[SCSI] mpt2sas: Release spinlock for the raid device list before blocking it

Added code to release the spinlock that is used to protect the
raid device list before calling a function that can block. The
blocking was causing a reschedule, and subsequently it is tried
to acquire the same lock, resulting in a panic (NMI Watchdog
detecting a CPU lockup).
