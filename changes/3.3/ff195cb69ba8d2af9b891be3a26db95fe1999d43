rcu: Warn when srcu_read_lock() is used in an extended quiescent state

Catch SRCU up to the other variants of RCU by making PROVE_RCU
complain if either srcu_read_lock() or srcu_read_lock_held() are
used from within RCU-idle mode.

Frederic reworked this to allow for the new versions of his patches
that check for extended quiescent states.
