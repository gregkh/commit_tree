cpufreq: OMAP: only supports OPP library

OMAP2 is the only family using clk_[init|exit]_cpufreq_table, however,
the cpufreq code does not currently use clk_init_cpufreq_table. As a
result, it is unusuable for OMAP2 and only usable only on platforms
using OPP library.

Remove the unbalanced clk_exit_cpufreq_table().  Any platforms where
OPPs are not availble will fail on init because a freq table will not
be properly initialized.
