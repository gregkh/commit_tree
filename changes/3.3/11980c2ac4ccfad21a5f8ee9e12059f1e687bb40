ashmem: Anonymous shared memory subsystem

The anonymous shared memory (ashmem) subsystem provides a
Unix-y,file-based shared memory interface to user-space. It
works like anonymous memory (e.g. mmapping fd=0) except if
you share the file descriptor via the usual means, you will
share the mapping. The shared memory can be accessed via both
mmap or file I/O. The backing store is a simple shmem file.

Additionally, ashmem introduces the concept of page pinning.
Pinned pages (the default) behave like any anonymous memory.
Unpinned pages are available to the kernel for eviction during
VM pressure. When repinning the pages, the return value
instructs user-space as to any eviction. In this manner,
user-space processes may implement caching and similar
resource management that efficiently integrates with kernel
memory management.

ashmem: Don't install fault handler for private mmaps.

Ashmem is used to create named private heaps. If this heap is backed
by a tmpfs file it will allocate two pages for every page touched.
In 2.6.27, the extra page would later be freed, but 2.6.29 does not
scan anonymous pages when running without swap so the memory is not
freed while the file is referenced. This change changes the behavior
of private ashmem mmaps to match /dev/zero instead tmpfs.

ashmem: don't require a page aligned size

This makes ashmem more similar to shmem and mmap, by
not requiring the specified size to be page aligned,
instead rounding it internally as needed.

[jstultz: Improved commit subject and included patch description
from rlove. Also moved ashmem files to staging dir, and reworked
code to avoid touching mm/shmem.c while we're in staging.]
