NET: NETROM: When adding a route verify length of mnemonic string.

struct nr_route_struct's mnemonic permits a string of up to 7 bytes to be
used.  If userland passes a not zero terminated string to the kernel adding
a node to the routing table might result in the kernel attempting to read
copy a too long string.

Mnemonic is part of the NET/ROM routing protocol; NET/ROM routing table
updates only broadcast 6 bytes.  The 7th byte in the mnemonic array exists
only as a \0 termination character for the kernel code's convenience.

Fixed by rejecting mnemonic strings that have no terminating \0 in the first
7 characters.  Do this test only NETROM_NODE to avoid breaking NETROM_NEIGH
where userland might passing an uninitialized mnemonic field.
