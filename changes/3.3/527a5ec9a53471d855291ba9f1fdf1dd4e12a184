mm: memcg: per-priority per-zone hierarchy scan generations

Memory cgroup limit reclaim currently picks one memory cgroup out of the
target hierarchy, remembers it as the last scanned child, and reclaims
all zones in it with decreasing priority levels.

The new hierarchy reclaim code will pick memory cgroups from the same
hierarchy concurrently from different zones and priority levels, it
becomes necessary that hierarchy roots not only remember the last
scanned child, but do so for each zone and priority level.

Until now, we reclaimed memcgs like this:

    mem = mem_cgroup_iter(root)
    for each priority level:
      for each zone in zonelist:
        reclaim(mem, zone)

But subsequent patches will move the memcg iteration inside the loop
over the zones:

    for each priority level:
      for each zone in zonelist:
        mem = mem_cgroup_iter(root)
        reclaim(mem, zone)

And to keep with the original scan order - memcg -> priority -> zone -
the last scanned memcg has to be remembered per zone and per priority
level.

Furthermore, global reclaim will be switched to the hierarchy walk as
well.  Different from limit reclaim, which can just recheck the limit
after some reclaim progress, its target is to scan all memcgs for the
desired zone pages, proportional to the memcg size, and so reliably
detecting a full hierarchy round-trip will become crucial.

Currently, the code relies on one reclaimer encountering the same memcg
twice, but that is error-prone with concurrent reclaimers.  Instead, use
a generation counter that is increased every time the child with the
highest ID has been visited, so that reclaimers can stop when the
generation changes.
