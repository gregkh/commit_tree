Bluetooth: Move pending management command list into struct hci_dev

This patch moves the pending management command list (previously global
to mgmt.c) into struct hci_dev. This makes it possible to do proper
locking when accessing it (through the existing hci_dev locks) and
thereby avoid race conditions.
