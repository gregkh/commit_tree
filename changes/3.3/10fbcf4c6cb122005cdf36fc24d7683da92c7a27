convert 'memory' sysdev_class to a regular subsystem

This moves the 'memory sysdev_class' over to a regular 'memory' subsystem
and converts the devices to regular devices. The sysdev drivers are
implemented as subsystem interfaces now.

After all sysdev classes are ported to regular driver core entities, the
sysdev implementation will be entirely removed from the kernel.
