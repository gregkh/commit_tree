tg3: Fix tg3_get_stats64 for 5700 / 5701 devs

tg3_get_stats64() takes tp->lock when dealing with non-serdes bcm5700
and bcm5701 devices.  However, functions that call tg3_halt() have
already acquired tp->lock.  When tg3_get_stats64() is called in
tg3_halt(), deadlock will occur.

This patch fixes the problem by separating the stat gathering code into
a new tg3_get_nstats() function.  tg3_get_stats64() is recoded to call
this function and take tp->lock.  The code that takes tp->lock in
tg3_calc_crc_errors() has been removed.  Function signatures have been
cleaned up too.
