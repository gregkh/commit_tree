[S390] topology: increase poll frequency if change is anticipated

Increase cpu topology change poll frequency if a change is anticipated.
Otherwise a user might be a bit confused to have to wait up to a minute
in order to see a change this should be visible immediatly.
However there is no guarantee that the change will happen during the
time frame the poll frequency is increased.
