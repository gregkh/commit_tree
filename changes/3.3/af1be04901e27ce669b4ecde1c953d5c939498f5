iommu/amd: Work around broken IVRS tables

On some systems the IVRS table does not contain all PCI
devices present in the system. In case a device not present
in the IVRS table is translated by the IOMMU no DMA is
possible from that device by default.
This patch fixes this by removing the DTE entry for every
PCI device present in the system and not covered by IVRS.
