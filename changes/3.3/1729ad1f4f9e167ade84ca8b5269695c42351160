Input: i8042 - also perform controller reset when suspending

In addition to some laptops needing i8042 reset after resuming from S2R to
get their touchpads working there is another class of laptops - ones that
need i8042 reset before going to S2R, otherwise they will simply reboot
instead of resuming.

See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15612

This change forces reset of i8042 before doing S2R.
