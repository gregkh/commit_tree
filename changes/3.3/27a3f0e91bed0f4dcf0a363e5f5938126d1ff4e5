ARM: sort the meminfo array earlier

The meminfo array has to be sorted before sanity_check_meminfo() in
arch/arm/mm/mmu.c is called for it to work properly.  This also allows
for a simpler find_limits() in arch/arm/mm/init.c.

The sort is moved to arch/arm/kernel/setup.c because that's where the
meminfo array is populated.  Eventually this should be improved upon
to make the memory bank parser a bit more robust against problems
such as overlapping memory ranges.
