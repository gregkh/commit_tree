ALSA: hda - Fix initialization of secondary capture source on VT1705

VT1705 codec has two ADCs where the secondary ADC has no MUX but only
a fixed connection to the mic pin.  This confused the driver and it
tries always overriding the input-source selection by assumption of
the existing MUX for the secondary ADC, resulted in resetting the
input-source at each time PM (including power-saving) occurs.

The fix is simply to check the existence of MUX for secondary ADCs in
the initialization code.
