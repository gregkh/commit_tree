Bluetooth: Remove global mutex hci_task_lock

The hci_task_lock mutex (previously a lock) was supposed to protect the
register/unregister of HCI protocols against RX/TX tasks. This will not
be needed anymore because SCO and L2CAP will always be compiled.

Moreover, with the recent move of RX/TX to workqueues per device the
global hci_task_lock was causing starvation between different HCI
devices.
