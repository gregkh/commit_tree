ath6kl: Perform WOW resume in RX path in case of SDIO IRQ wake up

The target triggers sdio data line to wake up the host when
WOW pattern matches. This causes sdio irq handler is being
executed in the host side which internally hits ath6kl's RX path.

WOW resume should happen before start processing any data from
the target. So it's required to perform WOW resume in RX path.

This area needs bit rework to avoid WOW resume in RX path,
As of now it's fine to have this model, rework will be done later.
