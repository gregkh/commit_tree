staging:iio: Make sure a device is only opened once at a time

Our buffer implementation does not support multiple concurrent readers. So we
have to ensure that a device is only opened once at a time. So do the same thing
we do for the event fd and introduce a per device busy flag. The flag gets set
when opening the device and gets cleared when closing the device. If a open is
attempted while the busy flag is set we return -EBUSY.
