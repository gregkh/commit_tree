net: make ipv6 bind honour freebind

This makes native ipv6 bind follow the precedent set by:
  - native ipv4 bind behaviour
  - dual stack ipv4-mapped ipv6 bind behaviour.

This does allow an unpriviledged process to spoof its source IPv6
address, just like it currently can spoof its source IPv4 address
(for example when using UDP).
