sched/accounting: Re-use scheduler statistics for the root cgroup

Right now, after we collect tick statistics for user and system and store them
in a well known location, we keep the same statistics again for cpuacct.
Since cpuacct is hierarchical, the numbers for the root cgroup should be
absolutely equal to the system-wide numbers.

So it would be better to just use it: this patch changes cpuacct accounting
in a way that the cpustat statistics are kept in a struct kernel_cpustat percpu
array. In the root cgroup case, we just point it to the main array. The rest of
the hierarchy walk can be totally disabled later with a static branch - but I am
not doing it here.
