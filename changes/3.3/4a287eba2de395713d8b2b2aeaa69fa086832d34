IPv6 routing, NLM_F_* flag support: REPLACE and EXCL flags support, warn about missing CREATE flag

The support for NLM_F_* flags at IPv6 routing requests.

If NLM_F_CREATE flag is not defined for RTM_NEWROUTE request,
warning is printed, but no error is returned. Instead new route is
added. Later NLM_F_CREATE may be required for
new route creation.

Exception is when NLM_F_REPLACE flag is given without NLM_F_CREATE, and
no matching route is found. In this case it should be safe to assume
that the request issuer is familiar with NLM_F_* flags, and does really
not want route to be created.

Specifying NLM_F_REPLACE flag will now make the kernel to search for
matching route, and replace it with new one. If no route is found and
NLM_F_CREATE is specified as well, then new route is created.

Also, specifying NLM_F_EXCL will yield returning of error if matching
route is found.
