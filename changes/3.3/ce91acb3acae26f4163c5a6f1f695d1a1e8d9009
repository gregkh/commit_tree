cifs: lower default wsize when unix extensions are not used

We've had some reports of servers (namely, the Solaris in-kernel CIFS
server) that don't deal properly with writes that are "too large" even
though they set CAP_LARGE_WRITE_ANDX. Change the default to better
mirror what windows clients do.
