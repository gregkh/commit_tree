USB: cp210x: fix CP2104 baudrate usage

This fix changes the way baudrates are set on the CP210x devices from
Silicon Labs. The CP2101/2/3 will respond to both a GET/SET_BAUDDIV
command, and GET/SET_BAUDRATE command, while CP2104 and higher devices
only respond to GET/SET_BAUDRATE. The current cp210x.ko driver in
kernel version 3.2.0 only implements the GET/SET_BAUDDIV command.

This patch implements the two new codes for the GET/SET_BAUDRATE
commands. Then there is a change in the way that the baudrate is
assigned or retrieved. This is done according to the CP210x USB
specification in AN571. This document can be found here:

Sections 5.3/5.4 describe the USB packets for the old baudrate method.
Sections 5.5/5.6 describe the USB packets for the new method. This
patch also implements the new request scheme, and eliminates the
unnecessary baudrate calculations since it uses the "actual baudrate"
method.

This patch solves the problem reported for the CP2104 in bug 42586,
and also keeps support for all other devices (CP2101/2/3).

This patchfile is also attached to the bug report on
bugzilla.kernel.org. This patch has been developed and test on the
3.2.0 mainline kernel version under Ubuntu 10.11.
