power_supply: Mark da9052 driver as broken

There are some problems with MFD part of this driver, so the
driver fails to build:

drivers/power/da9052-battery.c: In function 'da9052_bat_read_volt':
drivers/power/da9052-battery.c:293:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'da9052_adc_manual_read' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/power/da9052-battery.c: In function 'da9052_bat_check_presence':
drivers/power/da9052-battery.c:306:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'da9052_adc_read_temp' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/power/da9052-battery.c: In function 'da9052_determine_vc_tbl_index':
drivers/power/da9052-battery.c:348:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
cc1: some warnings being treated as errors

The fix for MFD part will probably go post -rc1 (or in the next merge
window), so let's disable the driver for now.
