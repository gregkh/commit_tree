powerpc/85xx: Rework MPC8548CDS device trees

Utilize new split between board & SoC, and new SoC device trees split
into pre & post utilizing 'template' includes for SoC IP blocks.

Other changes include:
* Moved to a standard 2 #address-cells & #size-cells at top-level
* Moved to specifying interrupt-parent for mpic at root
* Moved to 4-cell mpic interrupt cells to support MPIC timers
* Moved mdio nodes up one level instead of under tsec nodes
* Reworked PCIe nodes to allow supportin IRQs for controller (errors)
  and moved PCI device IRQs down to virtual bridge level
* Removed CPU properties setup by u-boot to match other .dts
* Added localbus node, but no chipselect details at this point
* Added MPIC / PCIe msi node
* Dropping "fsl,mpc8548-IP..." from compatibles for standard blocks
