x86: Generate system call tables and unistd_*.h from tables

Generate system call tables and unistd_*.h automatically from the
tables in arch/x86/syscalls.  All other information, like NR_syscalls,
is auto-generated, some of which is in asm-offsets_*.c.

This allows us to keep all the system call information in one place,
and allows for kernel space and user space to see different
information; this is currently used for the ia32 system call numbers
when building the 64-bit kernel, but will be used by the x32 ABI in
the near future.

This also removes some gratuitious differences between i386, x86-64
and ia32; in particular, now all system call tables are generated with
the same mechanism.
