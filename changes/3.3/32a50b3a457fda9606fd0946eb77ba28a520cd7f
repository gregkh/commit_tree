mtd: docg3: fix reading oob+data without correction

Fix the docg3 reads to be able to cope with all possible
data buffer / oob buffer / file mode combinations from
docg3_read_oob().
This especially ensures that raw reads do not use ECC
corrections, and AUTOOOB and PLACEOOB do use ECC
correction.

The approach is to empty docg3_read() and make it a wrapper
to docg3_read_oob(). As docg3_read_oob() handles all the
funny cases (no data buffer but oob buffer, data buffer but
no oob buffer, ...), docg3_read() is just a special use of
docg3_read_oob().
