spi/pl022: move device disable to workqueue thread

Moves the disabling of the device and clocks to the same thread in
which the device and clocks are enabled. This avoids SMP issues where
the device can be enabled for a transfer by one thread and then
disabled by the completion of the previous transfer in another thread.
