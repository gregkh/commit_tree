btrfs: don't check DUP chunks twice

Because scrub enumerates the dev extent tree to find the chunks to scrub,
it currently finds each DUP chunk twice and also scrubs it twice. This
patch makes sure that scrub_chunk only checks that part of the chunk the
dev extent has been found for. This only changes the behaviour for DUP
chunks.
