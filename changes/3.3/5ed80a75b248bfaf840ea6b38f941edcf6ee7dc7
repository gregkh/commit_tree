ASoC: i.MX SSI: Fix DSP_A format.

According to i.MX27 Reference Manual (p 1593) TXBIT0 bit selects
whether the most significant or the less significant part of the
data word written to the FIFO is transmitted.

As DSP_A is the same as DSP_B with a data offset of 1 bit, it
doesn't make any sense to remove TXBIT0 bit here.
