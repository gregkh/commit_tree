drm/i915: relative_constants_mode race fix

dev_priv keeps track of the current addressing mode that gets set at
execbuffer time. Unfortunately the existing code was doing this before
acquiring struct_mutex which leaves a race with another thread also
doing an execbuffer. If that wasn't bad enough, relocate_slow drops
struct_mutex which opens a much more likely error where another thread
comes in and modifies the state while relocate_slow is being slow.

The solution here is to just defer setting this state until we
absolutely need it, and we know we'll have struct_mutex for the
remainder of our code path.

v2: Keith noticed a bug in the original patch.
