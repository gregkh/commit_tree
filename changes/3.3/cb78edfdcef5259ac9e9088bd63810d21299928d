kdump: define KEXEC_NOTE_BYTES arch specific for s390x

kdump only allocates memory for the prstatus ELF note.  For s390x,
besides of prstatus multiple ELF notes for various different register
types are stored.  Therefore the currently allocated memory is not
sufficient.  With this patch the KEXEC_NOTE_BYTES macro can be defined
by architecture code and for s390x it is set to the correct size now.
