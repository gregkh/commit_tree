hwmon: (adm1031) Fix coding style issues

Fix almost all coding style issues except for the multi-line macro errors,
which do not really apply since the macros are not multi-line statements
but declarations.

Based on merged patch series from Zac Storer; fixed remaining checkpatch
errors and warnings.
