sparc32, leon/PCI: convert to pci_scan_root_bus() for correct root bus resources

Convert from pci_scan_bus_parented() to pci_scan_root_bus() and remove root
bus resource fixups.  This fixes the problem of "early" and "header" quirks
seeing incorrect root bus resources.

pci_scan_root_bus() also includes the pci_bus_add_devices() so we don't
need to do that separately.
