mm, debug: test for online nid when allocating on single node

Calling alloc_pages_exact_node() means the allocation only passes the
zonelist of a single node into the page allocator.  If that node isn't
online, it's zonelist may never have been initialized causing a strange
oops that may not immediately be clear.

I recently debugged an issue where node 0 wasn't online and an allocator
was passing 0 to alloc_pages_exact_node() and it resulted in a NULL
pointer on zonelist->_zoneref.  If CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is enabled, though, it
would be nice to catch this a bit earlier.
