ARM: SAMSUNG: Fix missing api-change from subsys_interface change

Commit 4a858cfc9a (arm: convert sysdev_class to a regular subsystem)
converted the samsung sysdevs into subsys_interface instances.

While the original add-function only had a (struct sys_device *)
parameter, the dev_add from subsys_interface needs
	(struct device *, struct subsys_interface *)
leading to "initialized from incompatible pointer type" warnings.
