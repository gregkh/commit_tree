[media] it913x Support it9135 Verions 2 chip

Support for version 2 type chips and other LNA versions of version 1

Scripts may be compressed slightly at a later stage.

TODO
Firmware loader
However, things are a little confusing,  it is not clear that
dvb-usb-it9137-01.fw does not work with version 2 chips
as in recent files both firmwares are the same.

Should be applied to: 8133 Support for single ITE 9135 device.
