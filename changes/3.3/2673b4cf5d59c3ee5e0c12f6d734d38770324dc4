backing-dev: fix wakeup timer races with bdi_unregister()

While 7a401a972df8e18 ("backing-dev: ensure wakeup_timer is deleted")
addressed the problem of the bdi being freed with a queued wakeup
timer, there are other races that could happen if the wakeup timer
expires after/during bdi_unregister(), before bdi_destroy() is called.

wakeup_timer_fn() could attempt to wakeup a task which has already has
been freed, or could access a NULL bdi->dev via the wake_forker_thread
tracepoint.
