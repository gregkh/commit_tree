include/linux/crash_dump.h needs elf.h

Building an ARM target we get the following warnings:

  CC      arch/arm/kernel/setup.o
  In file included from arch/arm/kernel/setup.c:39:
  arch/arm/include/asm/elf.h:102:1: warning: "vmcore_elf64_check_arch" redefined
  In file included from arch/arm/kernel/setup.c:24:
  include/linux/crash_dump.h:30:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition

Quoting Russell King:

"linux/crash_dump.h makes no attempt to include asm/elf.h, but it depends
on stuff in asm/elf.h to determine how stuff inside this file is defined
at parse time.

So, if asm/elf.h is included after linux/crash_dump.h or not at all, you
get a different result from the situation where asm/elf.h is included
before."

So add elf.h header to crash_dump.h to avoid this problem.
