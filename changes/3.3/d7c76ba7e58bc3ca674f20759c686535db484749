checkpatch: improve memset and min/max with cast checking

Improve the checking of arguments to memset and min/max tests.

Move the checking of min/max to statement blocks instead of single line.
Change $Constant to allow any case type 0x initiator and trailing ul
specifier.  Add $FuncArg type as any function argument with or without a
cast.  Print the whole statement when showing memset or min/max messages.
Improve the memset with 0 as 3rd argument error message.

There are still weaknesses in the $FuncArg and $Constant code as arbitrary
parentheses and negative signs are not generically supported.
