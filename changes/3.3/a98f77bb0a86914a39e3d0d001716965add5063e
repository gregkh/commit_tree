ARM: omap: fix section mismatch warning for sdp3430_twl_gpio_setup()

WARNING: arch/arm/mach-omap2/built-in.o(.text+0xd0f0): Section mismatch in reference from the function sdp3430_twl_gpio_setup() to the function .init.text:omap2_hsmmc_init()
The function sdp3430_twl_gpio_setup() references
the function __init omap2_hsmmc_init().
This is often because sdp3430_twl_gpio_setup lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of omap2_hsmmc_init is wrong.

sdp3430_twl_gpio_setup() is called via platform data from the
gpio-twl4030 module, which can be inserted and removed at runtime.
This makes sdp3430_twl_gpio_setup() callable at runtime, and prevents
it being marked with an __init annotation.

As it calls omap2_hsmmc_init() unconditionally, the only resolution to
this warning is to remove the __init markings from omap2_hsmmc_init()
and its called functions.  This addresses the functions in hsmmc.c.
