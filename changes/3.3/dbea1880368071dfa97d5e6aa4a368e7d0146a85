[media] rc: Fix input deadlock and transmit error in redrat3 driver

Fixed submit urb logic so hardware doesn't hang trying to transmit
signal data

Removed unneeded enable/disable detector commands in
redrat3_transmit_ir (the hardware does this anyway) and converted
arguments to unsigned as per 5588dc2
