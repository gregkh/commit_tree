ethtool: Define and apply a default policy for RX flow hash indirection

All drivers that support modification of the RX flow hash indirection
table initialise it in the same way: RX rings are assigned to table
entries in rotation.  Make that default policy explicit by having them
call a ethtool_rxfh_indir_default() function.

In the ethtool core, add support for a zero size value for
ETHTOOL_SRXFHINDIR, which resets the table to this default.
