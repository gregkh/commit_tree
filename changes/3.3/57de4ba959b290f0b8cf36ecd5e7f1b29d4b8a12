drm/ttm: simplify memory accounting for ttm user v2

Provide helper function to compute the kernel memory size needed
for each buffer object. Move all the accounting inside ttm, simplifying
driver and avoiding code duplication accross them.

v2 fix accounting of ghost object, one would have thought that i
   would have run into the issue since a longtime but it seems
   ghost object are rare when you have plenty of vram ;)
