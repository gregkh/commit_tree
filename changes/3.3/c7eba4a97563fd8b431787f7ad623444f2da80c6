capabilities: introduce security_capable_noaudit

Exactly like security_capable except don't audit any denials.  This is for
places where the kernel may make decisions about what to do if a task has a
given capability, but which failing that capability is not a sign of a
security policy violation.  An example is checking if a task has
CAP_SYS_ADMIN to lower it's likelyhood of being killed by the oom killer.
This check is not a security violation if it is denied.
