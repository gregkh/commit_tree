RDMA/core: Fix kernel panic by always initializing qp->usecnt

We have just been investigating kernel panics related to
cq->ibcq.event_handler() completion calls.  The problem is that
ib_destroy_qp() fails with -EBUSY.

Further investigation revealed qp->usecnt is not initialized.  This
counter was introduced in linux-3.2 by commit 0e0ec7e0638e
("RDMA/core: Export ib_open_qp() to share XRC TGT QPs") but it only
gets initialized for IB_QPT_XRC_TGT, but it is checked in
ib_destroy_qp() for any QP type.

Fix this by initializing qp->usecnt for every QP we create.
