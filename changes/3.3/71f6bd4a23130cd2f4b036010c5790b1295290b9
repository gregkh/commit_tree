PCI: workaround hard-wired bus number V2

Fixes PCI device detection on IBM xSeries IBM 3850 M2 / x3950 M2
when using ACPI resources (_CRS).
This is default, a manual workaround (without this patch)
would be pci=nocrs boot param.

V2: Add dev_warn if the workaround is hit. This should reveal
how common such setups are (via google) and point to possible
problems if things are still not working as expected.
-> Suggested by Jan Beulich.
