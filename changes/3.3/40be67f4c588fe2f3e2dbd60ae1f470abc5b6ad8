target: Fix possible NULL pointer with __transport_execute_tasks

This patch makes __transport_execute_tasks() use a local *se_dev
reference to prevent direct se_cmd->se_dev access after
transport_cmd_check_stop() -> transport_add_tasks_from_cmd()
has been called, as in the current implementation we can expect
__transport_execute_tasks() may be called from another context
that may have already completed the I/O.
