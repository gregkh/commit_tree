Kbuild: Use dtc's -d (dependency) option

This hooks dtc into Kbuild's dependency system.

Thus, for example, "make dtbs" will rebuild tegra-harmony.dtb if only
tegra20.dtsi has changed yet tegra-harmony.dts has not. The previous
lack of this feature recently caused me to have very confusing "git
bisect" results.

For ARM, it's obvious what to add to $(targets). I'm not familiar enough
with other architectures to know what to add there. Powerpc appears to
already add various .dtb files into $(targets), but the other archs may
need something added to $(targets) to work.
