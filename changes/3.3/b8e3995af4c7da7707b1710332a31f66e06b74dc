netdev/phy/icplus: Correct broken phy_init code

The code for ip1001_config_init() was totally broken if you were not
using RGMII. Instead of returning an error code or zero it actually
returned the value in the IP1001_SPEC_CTRL_STATUS_2 register. It was
also trying to set the IP1001_APS_ON bit , but never actually wrote
back the register.

The error checking was also incorrect in both this function and the
reset function, so this patch fixes that up in a consistent fashion.
