ftrace: Remove usage of "freed" records

Records that are added to the function trace table are
permanently there, except for modules. By separating out the
modules to their own pages that can be freed in one shot
we can remove the "freed" flag and simplify some of the record
management.

Another benefit of doing this is that we can also move the
records around; sort them.
