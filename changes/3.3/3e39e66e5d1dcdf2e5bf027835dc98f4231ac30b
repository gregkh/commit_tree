MAINTAINERS: update xgifb maintainer's e-mail address

All patches sent to the maintainer address bounce:

   Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 5.1.1 <apatard@mandriva.com>: Recipient address
       rejected: User unknown in virtual mailbox table

The address found in drivers/staging/xgifb/TODO seems to work better.
