perf test: Validate PERF_RECORD_ events and perf_sample fields

This new test will validate these new routines extracted from 'perf
record':

 - perf_evlist__config_attrs
 - perf_evlist__prepare_workload
 - perf_evlist__start_workload

In addition to several other perf_evlist methods.

It consists of starting a simple workload, setting up just one event to
monitor ("cycles") requesting that several PERF_SAMPLE_ fields be
present in all events.

It then will check that the expected PERF_RECORD_ events are produced
and will sanity check all its fields.

Some checks performed:

. PERF_SAMPLE_TIME monotonically increases.

. PERF_SAMPLE_CPU is the one requested with sched_setaffinity

. PERF_SAMPLE_TID and PERF_SAMPLE_PID matches the one we forked
  in perf_evlist__prepare_workload and that is stored in
  evlist->workload.pid

. For the events where these fields are also present in its
  pre-sample_id_all fields (e.g. event->mmap.pid), that they are what
  is expected too.

. That we get a bunch of mmaps:

  PATH/libcSUFFIX
  PATH/ldSUFFIX
  [vdso]
  PATH/sleep

Example:

  [root@emilia ~]# taskset -c 3,4 perf test -v1 perf_sample
