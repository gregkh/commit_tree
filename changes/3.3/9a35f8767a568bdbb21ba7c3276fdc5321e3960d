usb: musb: allow building USB_MUSB_TUSB6010 as a module

Commit 1376d92f9 "usb: musb: allow musb and glue layers to be modules"
made the USB_MUSB_TUSB6010 option modular, but actually building
the driver as a module does not work, so various randconfig builds
actually fail. This changes all code that depends on the
option to also check for modular builds, and exports the necessary
symbols.
