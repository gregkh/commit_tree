perf probe: Ensure offset provided is not greater than function length without DWARF info too

The 'perf probe' command allows kprobe to be inserted at any offset from
a function start, which results in adding kprobes to unintended
location.  (example: perf probe do_fork+10000 is allowed even though
size of do_fork is ~904).

My previous patch https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/2/24/42 addressed the case
where DWARF info was available for the kernel. This patch fixes the
case where perf probe is used on a kernel without debuginfo available.
