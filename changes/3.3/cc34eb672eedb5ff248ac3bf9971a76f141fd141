sch_sfq: revert dont put new flow at the end of flows

This reverts commit d47a0ac7b6 (sch_sfq: dont put new flow at the end of
flows)

As Jesper found out, patch sounded great but has bad side effects.

In stress situation, pushing new flows in front of the queue can prevent
old flows doing any progress. Packets can stay in SFQ queue for
unlimited amount of time.

It's possible to add heuristics to limit this problem, but this would
add complexity outside of SFQ scope.

A more sensible answer to Dave Taht concerns (who reported the issued I
tried to solve in original commit) is probably to use a qdisc hierarchy
so that high prio packets dont enter a potentially crowded SFQ qdisc.
