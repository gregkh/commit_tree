ARM: 7296/1: proc-v7.S: remove HARVARD_CACHE preprocessor guards

On v7, we use the same cache maintenance instructions for data lines
as for unified lines. This was not the case for v6, where HARVARD_CACHE
was defined to indicate the L1 cache topology.

This patch removes the erroneous compile-time check for HARVARD_CACHE in
proc-v7.S, ensuring that we perform I-side invalidation at boot.
