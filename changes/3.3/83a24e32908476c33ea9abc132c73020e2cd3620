[S390] topology: get rid of ifdefs

Remove all ifdefs from topology code and also only compile it for the
CONFIG_SCHED_BOOK case. The new code selects SCHED_MC if SCHED_BOOK is
selected. SCHED_MC without SCHED_BOOK is not possible anymore.
Furthermore various sysfs attributes are not available anymore for the
!SCHED_BOOK case. In particular all attributes that correspond to
CPU polarization.
But since all real world kernels have SCHED_BOOK selected anyway this
doesn't matter too much.
