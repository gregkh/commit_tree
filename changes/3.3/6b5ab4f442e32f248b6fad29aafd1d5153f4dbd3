ARM: EXYNOS: Add Exynos4 device tree enabled board file

Add a new EXYNOS4 compatible device tree enabled board file. Boards
based on the EXYNOS4 family of SoC's can use this as the machine/board
file. When using this machine fike, a corresponding device tree blob
which describes the board's properties should be supplied at boot time
to the kernel.
