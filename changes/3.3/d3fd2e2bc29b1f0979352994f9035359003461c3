[SCSI] isci: update version to 1.1

Bump the version now that the driver has atapi support and the initial
round of hotplug fixes.  The EXPERIMENTAL tag should have been removed a
while back.  While we're here also kill the "select SCSI_SAS_HOST_SMP"
as the build error was separately fixed by commit d962480e "[SCSI]
libsas: fix try_test_sas_gpio_gp_bit() build error".
