powerpc/time: Optimise decrementer_check_overflow

decrementer_check_overflow is called from arch_local_irq_restore so
we want to make it as light weight as possible. As such, turn
decrementer_check_overflow into an inline function.

To avoid a circular mess of includes, separate out the two components
of struct decrementer_clock and keep the struct clock_event_device
part local to time.c.

The fast path improves from:

arch_local_irq_restore
     0:       mflr    r0
     4:       std     r0,16(r1)
     8:       stdu    r1,-112(r1)
     c:       stb     r3,578(r13)
    10:       cmpdi   cr7,r3,0
    14:       beq-    cr7,24 <.arch_local_irq_restore+0x24>
...
    24:       addi    r1,r1,112
    28:       ld      r0,16(r1)
    2c:       mtlr    r0
    30:       blr

to:

arch_local_irq_restore
    0:       std     r30,-16(r1)
    4:       ld      r30,0(r2)
    8:       stb     r3,578(r13)
    c:       cmpdi   cr7,r3,0
   10:       beq-    cr7,6c <.arch_local_irq_restore+0x6c>
...
   6c:       ld      r30,-16(r1)
   70:       blr

Unfortunately we still setup a local TOC (due to -mminimal-toc). Yet
another sign we should be moving to -mcmodel=medium.
