ARM: idmap: populate identity map pgd at init time using .init.text

When disabling and re-enabling the MMU, it is necessary to take out an
identity mapping for the code that manipulates the SCTLR in order to
avoid it disappearing from under our feet. This is useful when soft
rebooting and returning from CPU suspend.

This patch allocates a set of page tables during boot and populates them
with an identity mapping for the .idmap.text section. This means that
users of the identity map do not need to manage their own pgd and can
instead annotate their functions with __idmap or, in the case of assembly
code, place them in the correct section.
