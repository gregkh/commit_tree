usb_storage: don't use set_freezable_with_signal()

The current implementation of set_freezable_with_signal() is buggy and
tricky to get right.  usb-storage is the only user and its use can be
avoided trivially.

All usb-storage wants is to be able to sleep with timeout and get
woken up if freezing() becomes true.  This can be trivially
implemented by doing interruptible wait w/ freezing() included in the
wait condition.  There's no reason to use set_freezable_with_signal().

Perform interruptible wait on freezing() instead of using
set_freezable_with_signal(), which is scheduled for removal.
