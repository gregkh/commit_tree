ARM: restart: remove the now empty arch_reset()

Remove the now empty arch_reset() from all the mach/system.h includes,
and remove its callsite.  Remove arm_machine_restart() as this function
no longer does anything useful.

For samsung platforms, remove the include of mach/system-reset.h and
plat/system-reset.h from their respective mach/system.h headers as these
just define their arch_reset functions.  As a result, the s3c2410 and
plat-samsung system-reset.h files are no longer referenced, so remove
these files entirely.
