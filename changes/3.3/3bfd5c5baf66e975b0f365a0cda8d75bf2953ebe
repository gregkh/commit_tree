Input: add generic GPIO-tilt driver

There exist tilt switches that simply report their tilt-state via
some gpios. The number and orientation of their axes can vary
depending on the switch used and the build of the device. Also two
or more one-axis switches could be combined to provide multi-dimensional
orientation.

One example of a device using such a switch is the family of Qisda
ebook readers, where the switch provides information about the
landscape / portrait orientation of the device. The example in
Documentation/input/gpio-tilt.txt documents exactly this one-axis
device.
