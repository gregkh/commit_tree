cdrom: use copy_to_user() without the underscores

"nframes" comes from the user and "nframes * CD_FRAMESIZE_RAW" can wrap
on 32 bit systems.  That would have been ok if we used the same wrapped
value for the copy, but we use a shifted value.  We should just use the
checked version of copy_to_user() because it's not going to make a
difference to the speed.
