staging: android: lowmemkiller: Substantially reduce overhead during reclaim

This patch optimizes lowmemkiller to not do any work when it has an outstanding
kill-request. This greatly reduces the pressure on the task_list lock
(improving interactivity), as well as improving the vmscan performance
when under heavy memory pressure (by up to 20x in tests).

Note: For this enhancement to work, you need CONFIG_PROFILING
