kmemleak: Report previously found leaks even after an error

If an error fatal to kmemleak (like memory allocation failure) happens,
kmemleak disables itself but it also removes the access to any
previously found memory leaks. This patch allows read-only access to the
kmemleak debugfs interface but disables any other action.
