ARM: mach-shmobile: mackerel: use renesas_usbhs instead of r8a66597_hcd

Current renesas_usbhs driver can use both USB host/gadget.
This patch removes current r8a66597_hcd driver settings,
and adds renesas_usbhs host driver settings for mackerel USB1 port.
You can still use this port as "gadget" with small modify.
