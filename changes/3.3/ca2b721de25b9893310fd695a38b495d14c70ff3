enic: rearrange some of the port profile code

This patch rearranges some of the port profile code in enic_probe.
It moves out some lines of port profile related code currently
inside CONFIG_PCI_IOV. This is only done to move all port profile
related code together so that it can help isolate the port profile
handling code under a separate #ifdef in our internal build scripts.
