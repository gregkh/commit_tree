mm: page_alloc: generalize order handling in __free_pages_bootmem()

__free_pages_bootmem() used to special-case higher-order frees to save
individual page checking with free_pages_bulk().

Nowadays, both zero order and non-zero order frees use free_pages(), which
checks each individual page anyway, and so there is little point in making
the distinction anymore.  The higher-order loop will work just fine for
zero order pages.
