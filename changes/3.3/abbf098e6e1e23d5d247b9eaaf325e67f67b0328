md/raid10: preferentially read from replacement device if possible.

When reading (for array reads, not for recovery etc) we read from the
replacement device if it has recovered far enough.
This requires storing the chosen rdev in the 'r10_bio' so we can make
sure to drop the ref on the right device when the read finishes.
