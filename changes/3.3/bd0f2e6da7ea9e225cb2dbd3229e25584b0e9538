[media] omap3isp: ccdc: Fix crash in HS/VS interrupt handler

The HS/VS interrupt handler needs to access the pipeline object. It
erronously tries to get it from the CCDC output video node, which isn't
necessarily included in the pipeline. This leads to a NULL pointer
dereference.

Fix the bug by getting the pipeline object from the CCDC subdev entity.
