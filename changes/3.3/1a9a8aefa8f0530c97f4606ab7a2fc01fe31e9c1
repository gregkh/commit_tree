printk, lockdep: Switch to tracked irq ops

Switch to local_irq_ ops so that the irq state is properly tracked
(raw_local_irq_* isn't tracked by lockdep, causing confusion).

Possible now that commit dd4e5d3ac4a ("lockdep: Fix
trace_[soft,hard]irqs_[on,off]() recursion") cured the reason we
needed the raw_ ops.
