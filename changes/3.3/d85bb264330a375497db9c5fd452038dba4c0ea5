Bluetooth: Add missing confirm_name field to mgmt_ev_device_found

This patch adds a missing confirm_name field to mgmt_ev_device_found.
Support for setting the correct value for this field is not implemented
yet, but having it part of the struct definition ensures that user-space
gets correct sized device_found events and is thereby able to do at
least rudimentary parsing of them.
