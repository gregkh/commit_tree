Subject: [PATCH] NFS - fix recent breakage to NFS error handling.

commit 02c24a82187d5a628c68edfe71ae60dc135cd178 made a small and
presumably unintended change to write error handling in NFS.

Previously an error from filemap_write_and_wait_range would only be of
interest if nfs_file_fsync did not return an error.  After this commit,
an error from filemap_write_and_wait_range would mean that (the rest of)
nfs_file_fsync would not even be called.

This means that:
 1/ you are more likely to see EIO than e.g. EDQUOT or ENOSPC.
 2/ NFS_CONTEXT_ERROR_WRITE remains set for longer so more writes are
    synchronous.

This patch restores previous behaviour.
