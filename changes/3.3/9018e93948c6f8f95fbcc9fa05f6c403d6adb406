net: explicitly add jump_label.h header to sock.h

Commit 36a1211970193ce215de50ed1e4e1272bc814df1 removed linux/module.h
include statement from one of the headers that end up in net/sock.h.
It was providing us with static_branch() definition implicitly, so
after its removal the build got broken.

To fix this, and avoid having this happening in the future,
let me do the right thing and include linux/jump_label.h
explicitly in sock.h.
