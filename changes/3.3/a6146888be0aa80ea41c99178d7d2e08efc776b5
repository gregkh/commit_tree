powerpc: Add gpages reservation code for 64-bit FSL BOOKE

For 64-bit FSL_BOOKE implementations, gigantic pages need to be
reserved at boot time by the memblock code based on the command line.
This adds the call that handles the reservation, and fixes some code
comments.

It also removes the previous pr_err when reserve_hugetlb_gpages
is called on a system without hugetlb enabled - the way the code is
structured, the call is unconditional and the resulting error message
spurious and confusing.
