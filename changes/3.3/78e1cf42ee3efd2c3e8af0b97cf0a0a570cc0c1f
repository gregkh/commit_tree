I2C: OMAP: NACK without STP

On OMAP4 OMAP_I2C_STAT_NACK is causing a timeout on the next access.
The isr cleans all flags in OMAP_I2C_CON_REG by setting OMAP_I2C_CON_STP
OMAP_I2C_CON_STP is also set in omap_i2c_xfer_msg on the last message.

According to the TI TSR the sequence for OMAP_I2C_STAT_NACK and
OMAP_I2C_STAT_AL are nearly the same.
Removing the OMAP_I2C_CON_STP part in the isr fix the problem.
Tested on OMAP4430 and OMAP3530 (here NACK was not a problem)
Fixes also booting on 2430sdp.
