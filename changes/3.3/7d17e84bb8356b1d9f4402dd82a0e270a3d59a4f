xen/grant-table: Support mappings required by blkback

Add support for mappings without GNTMAP_contains_pte. This was not
supported because the unmap operation assumed that this flag was being
used; adding a parameter to the unmap operation to allow the PTE
clearing to be disabled is sufficient to make unmap capable of
supporting either mapping type.
