Revert "ARM: sa11x0: Implement autoloading of codec and codec pdata for mcp bus."

This reverts commit 5dd7bf59e0e8563265b3e5b33276099ef628fcc7.

This change is wrong on many levels.  First and foremost, it causes a
regression.  On boot on Assabet, which this patch gives a codec id of
'ucb1x00', it gives:

	ucb1x00 ID not found: 1005

0x1005 is a valid ID for the UCB1300 device.

Secondly, this patch is way over the top in terms of complexity.  The
only device which has been seen to be connected with this MCP code is
the UCB1x00 (UCB1200, UCB1300 etc) devices, and they all use the same
driver.  Adding a match table, requiring the codec string to match the
hardware ID read out of the ID register, etc is completely over the top
when we can just read the hardware ID register.
