ore: FIX breakage when MISC_FILESYSTEMS is not set

As Reported by Randy Dunlap

When MISC_FILESYSTEMS is not enabled and NFS4.1 is:

fs/built-in.o: In function `objio_alloc_io_state':
objio_osd.c:(.text+0xcb525): undefined reference to `ore_get_rw_state'
fs/built-in.o: In function `_write_done':
objio_osd.c:(.text+0xcb58d): undefined reference to `ore_check_io'
fs/built-in.o: In function `_read_done':
...

When MISC_FILESYSTEMS, which is more of a GUI thing then anything else,
is not selected. exofs/Kconfig is never examined during Kconfig,
and it can not do it's magic stuff to automatically select everything
needed.

We must split exofs/Kconfig in two. The ore one is always included.
And the exofs one is left in it's old place in the menu.
