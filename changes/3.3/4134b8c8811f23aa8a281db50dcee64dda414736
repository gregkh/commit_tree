ACPI, APEI, Resolve false conflict between ACPI NVS and APEI

Some firmware will access memory in ACPI NVS region via APEI.  That
is, instructions in APEI ERST/EINJ table will read/write ACPI NVS
region.  The original resource conflict checking in APEI code will
check memory/ioport accessed by APEI via general resource management
mech.  But ACPI NVS region is marked as busy already, so that the
false resource conflict will prevent APEI ERST/EINJ to work.

To fix this, this patch excludes ACPI NVS regions when APEI components
request resources.  So that they will not conflict with ACPI NVS
regions.
