mmc: core: Fixup suspend/resume issues for UHS-I cards

Even if cards supports 1.8V I/O voltage those should anyway be
initialized at 3.3V I/O according to (e)MMC, SD and SDIO specs.
Some eMMC and embedded SDIO devices are able to be initialized
at 1.8V as well, but it is better to be safe.

Do note that initialization in this context means that the card
has been completely powered off, otherwise the card will remain
at the last I/O voltage level that were negotitiated.

Due to the above being taken care of the suspend/resume issues
for UHS-I SD-cards has been fixed.
