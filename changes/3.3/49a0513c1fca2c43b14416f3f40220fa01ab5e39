[media] drivers/media/video/davinci/vpbe_display.c: eliminate a null pointer dereference

In the original code, probe_out could be reached when res was null and then
when the irq had not yet been requested.  In those cases, the call to
free_irq is not needed, so move probe_out down and introduce a new label
for the case where calling free_irq is useful.

The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:

// <smpl>
@r@
expression E, E1;
identifier f;
statement S1,S2,S3;
@@

if (E == NULL)
{
  ... when != if (E == NULL || ...) S1 else S2
      when != E = E1
*E->f
  ... when any
  return ...;
}
else S3
// </smpl>
