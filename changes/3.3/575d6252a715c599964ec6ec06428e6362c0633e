[media] m5mols: Extend the busy wait helper

Make m5mols_busy_wait function jiffies based rather than relying
on some fixed number of I2C read iterations while busy waiting
for the device to execute a request. With fixed number of iterations
we may be getting different wait times, depending on the I2C speed.

In some conditions we have to wait even if the I2C communications
fails, in those cases M5MOLS_I2C_RDY_WAIT_MASK should be passed
as the mask argument to m5mols_busy_wait().
