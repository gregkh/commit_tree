[media] video: Drop undue references to i2c-algo-bit

There's one comment that has been copied from bttv to many other
media/video drivers:

/* init + register i2c algo-bit adapter */

Meanwhile, many drivers use hardware I2C implementations instead of
relying on i2c-algo-bit, so this comment is misleading. Remove the
reference to "algo-bit" from all drivers, to avoid any confusion. This
is the best way to ensure that the comments won't go out of sync
again. Anyone interested in the implementation details would rather
look at the code itself.
