debugfs: add tools to printk 32-bit registers

Some debugfs file I deal with are mostly blocks of registers,
i.e. lines of the form "<name> = 0x<value>". Some files are only
registers, some include registers blocks among other material.  This
patch introduces data structures and functions to deal with both
cases.  I expect more users of this over time.
