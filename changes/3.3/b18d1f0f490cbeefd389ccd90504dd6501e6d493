mfd: Set twl4030-irq tertiary interrupts to be nested/threaded.

As tertiary interrupts are handled by handle_twl4030_sih calling
handle_nested_irq, they do not need their own separate irq thread.
So mark them as 'nested_thread' interrupts to avoid the extra thread
creation.

Tested on GTA04 Pheonux.
