panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops

When an oops causes a panic and panic prints another backtrace it's pretty
common to have the original oops data be scrolled away on a 80x50 screen.

The second backtrace is quite redundant and not needed anyways.

So don't print the panic backtrace when oops_in_progress is true.
