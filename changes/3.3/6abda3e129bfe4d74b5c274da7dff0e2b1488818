ARM: mxs: select HAVE_CLK_PREPARE for clock

This patch adds clk_prepare/clk_unprepare for mxs clock api by
renaming the existing non-atomic clk_enable/clk_disable to
clk_prepare/clk_unprepare and adding a pair of dummy
clk_enable/clk_disable.  Then with selecting HAVE_CLK_PREPARE for
mxs clock, we can fix the mutex locking warning that has been
reported for a few times.
