[media] Don't test for ops->info.type inside drivers

Now, ops->info.type is handled inside the dvb_frontend
core, only for DVBv3 calls, and according with the
delivery system. So, drivers should not care or use it,
otherwise, it may have issues with DVBv5 calls.

The drivers that were still using it were detected via
this small temporary hack:
