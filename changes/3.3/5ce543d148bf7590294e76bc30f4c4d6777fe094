cfg80211: Restore orig channel values upon disconnect

When we restore regulatory settings the world regulatory domain
is properly reset on cfg80211 (or user prefered regulatory domain)
but we were never setting back channel values for drivers that use
WIPHY_FLAG_CUSTOM_REGULATORY. Set these values up again by using
the orig_ channel parameters.

This fixes restoring custom regulatory settings upon disconnect
events.
