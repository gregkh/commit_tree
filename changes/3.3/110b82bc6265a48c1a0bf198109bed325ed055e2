be2net: fix ethtool ringparam reporting

The ethtool "-g" option is supposed to report the max queue length and
user modified queue length for RX and TX queues.  be2net doesn't support
user modification of queue lengths. So, the correct values for these
would be the max numbers.
be2net incorrectly reports the queue used values for these fields.
