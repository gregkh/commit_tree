workqueue: make alloc_workqueue() take printf fmt and args for name

alloc_workqueue() currently expects the passed in @name pointer to remain
accessible.  This is inconvenient and a bit silly given that the whole wq
is being dynamically allocated.  This patch updates alloc_workqueue() and
friends to take printf format string instead of opaque string and matching
varargs at the end.  The name is allocated together with the wq and
formatted.

alloc_ordered_workqueue() is converted to a macro to unify varargs
handling with alloc_workqueue(), and, while at it, add comment to
alloc_workqueue().

None of the current in-kernel users pass in string with '%' as constant
name and this change shouldn't cause any problem.
