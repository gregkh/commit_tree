ath9k_hw: fix sparse complaint on ar9003_switch_com_spdt_get()

This fixes this sparse complaint:

make C=2 CF="-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__" M=drivers/net/wireless/ath/

  CHECK   drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/ar9003_eeprom.c

The eep->modalHeader5G.switchcomspdt is a le16 and we return u16,
so just return le16_to_cpu().
