rcu: Deconfuse dynticks entry-exit tracing

The trace_rcu_dyntick() trace event did not print both the old and
the new value of the nesting level, and furthermore printed only
the low-order 32 bits of it.  This could result in some confusion
when interpreting trace-event dumps, so this commit prints both
the old and the new value, prints the full 64 bits, and also selects
the process-entry/exit increment to print nicely in hexadecimal.
