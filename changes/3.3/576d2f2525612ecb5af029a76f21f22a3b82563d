ARM: add generic ioremap optimization by reusing static mappings

Now that we have all the static mappings from iotable_init() located
in the vmalloc area, it is trivial to optimize ioremap by reusing those
static mappings when the requested physical area fits in one of them,
and so in a generic way for all platforms.
