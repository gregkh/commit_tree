perf session: Move threads to struct machine

The 'machine' abstraction was introduced with 'perf kvm' where we could
have samples for the host and multiple guests, but at the time we ended
up keeping the list of all machines threads all in
session->host_machine.

Move the threads rb_tree to struct machine to separate the namespaces.
