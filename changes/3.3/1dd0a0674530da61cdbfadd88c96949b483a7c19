target: use save/restore lock primitive in core_dec_lacl_count()

It may happen that uasp will free the request in irq conntext, the
callchain:

 uasp_cmd_release() -> transport_generic_free_cmd() -> core_dec_lacl_count()

where the last function enables the IRQ. Those irqs are re-disabled
later (due to the spin.*irq_restore) but in between we could get hurt.
