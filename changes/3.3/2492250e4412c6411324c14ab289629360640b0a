ALSA: oxygen, virtuoso: fix exchanged L/R volumes of aux and CD inputs

The driver accidentally exchanged the left/right fields for stereo AC'97
mixer registers.  This affected only the aux and CD inputs because the
line input bypasses the AC'97 codec and the mic input is mono; cards
without AC'97 (Xonar DS/DG/HDAV Slim, HG2PCI, HiFier) were not affected.
