ARM: suspend: use idmap_pgd instead of suspend_pgd

The ARM CPU suspend code requires cpu_resume_mmu to be identity mapped
in order to re-enable the MMU when coming out of suspend. Currently,
this is accomplished by maintaining a suspend_pgd with the relevant
mapping put in place at init time.

This patch replaces the use of suspend_pgd with the new idmap_pgd.
cpu_resume_mmu is placed in the .idmap.text section so that it is
included in the identity map.
