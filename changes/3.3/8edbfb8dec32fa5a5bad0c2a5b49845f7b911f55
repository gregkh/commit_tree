staging/comedi/das08: Convert pci_table entries to PCI_DEVICE (if PCI_ANY_ID is used)

This patch converts pci_table entries to use the PCI_DEVICE macro,
if .subvendor and .subdevice are set to PCI_ANY_ID,
and thus improves readablity.

Since the driver_data field isn't used anywhere we can also drop the
assignments for class, class_mask and driver_data.
