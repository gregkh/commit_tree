virtio: console: Add freeze and restore handlers to support S4

Remove all vqs and associated buffers in the freeze callback which
prepares us to go into hibernation state.  On restore, re-create all the
vqs and populate the input vqs with buffers to get to the pre-hibernate
state.

Note: Any outstanding unconsumed buffers are discarded; which means
there's a possibility of data loss in case the host or the guest didn't
consume any data already present in the vqs.  This can be addressed in a
later patch series, perhaps in virtio common code.
