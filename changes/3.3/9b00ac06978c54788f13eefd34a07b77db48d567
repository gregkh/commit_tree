powerpc: Remove broken and complicated kdump system reset code

We have a lot of complicated logic that handles possible recursion between
kdump and a system reset exception. We can solve this in a much simpler
way using the same setjmp/longjmp tricks xmon does.

As a first step, this patch removes the old system reset code.
