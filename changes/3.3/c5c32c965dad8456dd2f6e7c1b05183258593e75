ARM: S3C64XX: Hook up Littlemill audio card on Cragganmore

The Littlemill audio card is an adaptor card which can take any 6220-EV1
CODEC daughtercard. Provide standard support for the use of WM8994 class
devices on the Littlemill card, configuring the MFD for WM8958 usage as
this part is a superset of all others and the driver will use runtime
detection to identify the actually fitted part given the configuration for
the superset.
