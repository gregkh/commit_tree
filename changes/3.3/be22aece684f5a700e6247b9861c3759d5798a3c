memcg: revert fix to mapcount check for this release

Respectfully revert commit e6ca7b89dc76 "memcg: fix mapcount check
in move charge code for anonymous page" for the 3.3 release, so that
it behaves exactly like releases 2.6.35 through 3.2 in this respect.

Horiguchi-san's commit is correct in itself, 1 makes much more sense
than 2 in that check; but it does not go far enough - swapcount
should be considered too - if we really want such a check at all.

We appear to have reached agreement now, and expect that 3.4 will
remove the mapcount check, but had better not make 3.3 different.
