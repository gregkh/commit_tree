Btrfs: generic data structure to build unique lists

ulist is a generic data structures to hold a collection of unique u64
values. The only operations it supports is adding to the list and
enumerating it.

It is possible to store an auxiliary value along with the key. The
implementation is preliminary and can probably be sped up significantly.

It is used by btrfs_find_all_roots() quota to translate recursions into
iterative loops.
