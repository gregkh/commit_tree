mtd: docg3: add ECC correction code

Credit for discovering the BCH algorith parameters, and bit
reversing algorithm is to be give to Mike Dunn and Ivan
Djelic.

The BCH correction code relied upon the BCH library, where
all data and ECC is bit-reversed. The BCH library works
correctly when each input byte is bit-reversed, and
accordingly ECC output is also bit-reversed.
