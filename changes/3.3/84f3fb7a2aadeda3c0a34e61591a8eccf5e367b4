m68k: handle presence of 64bit mul/div instructions cleanly

The traditional 68000 processors and the newer reduced instruction set
ColdFire processors do not support the 32*32->64 multiply or the 64/32->32
divide instructions. This is not a difference based on the presence of
a hardware MMU or not.

Create a new config symbol to mark that a CPU type doesn't support the
longer multiply/divide instructions. Use this then as a basis for using
the fast 64bit based divide (in div64.h) and for linking in the extra
libgcc functions that may be required (mulsi3, divsi3, etc).
