ARM: OMAP2+: UART: Avoid uart idling on suspend for no_console_suspend usecase

If no_console_suspend is used we have prevent uart idling during suspend
to provide debug prints.

Power domain hooks can idle uarts if left enabled during system wide suspend
so re-use the omap_device_disable_idle_on_suspend API's to ensure console_uart
is not idled during suspend.

omap_device_disable_idle_on_suspend API was used on all uarts since the uart
driver was not runtime adapted, now with runtime adaptation we can re-use this
API only for no_console_suspend use cases.
