power_supply: Add initial Charger-Manager driver

Because battery health monitoring should be done even when suspended,
it needs to wake up and suspend periodically. Thus, userspace battery
monitoring may incur too much overhead; every device and task is woken
up periodically. Charger Manager uses suspend-again to provide
in-suspend monitoring.

This patch allows to monitor battery health in-suspend state.
