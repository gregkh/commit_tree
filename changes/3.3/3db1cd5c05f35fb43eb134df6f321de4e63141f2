net: fix assignment of 0/1 to bool variables.

   Please, this kind of stuff rots forever and not using bool properly
   drives me crazy.

Joe Perches <joe@perches.com> gave me the spatch script:

	@@
	bool b;
	@@
	-b = 0
	+b = false
	@@
	bool b;
	@@
	-b = 1
	+b = true

I merely installed coccinelle, read the documentation and took credit.
