PCI: add pci_create_root_bus() that accepts resource list

pci_create_bus() assigns ioport_resource and iomem_resource as the default
bus resources, i.e., the entire address space.  Architectures fix these
later, typically in pcibios_fixup_bus() or after pci_scan_bus_parented()
returns, but code that runs in the interim sees incorrect resource
information.

This patch adds a new pci_create_root_bus() that sets the bus resources
correctly from a supplied list of resources.

I intend to remove pci_create_bus() after changing all callers.

Based on original patch by Deng-Cheng Zhu.
