net/hyperv: fix erroneous NETDEV_TX_BUSY use

A driver start_xmit() method cannot free skb and return NETDEV_TX_BUSY,
since caller is going to reuse freed skb.

This is mostly a revert of commit bf769375c (staging: hv: fix the return
status of netvsc_start_xmit())

In fact netif_tx_stop_queue() / netif_stop_queue() is needed before
returning NETDEV_TX_BUSY or you can trigger a ksoftirqd fatal loop.

In case of memory allocation error, only safe way is to drop the packet
and return NETDEV_TX_OK
