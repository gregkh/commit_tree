vfs: Provide function to get superblock and wait for it to thaw

In quota code we need to find a superblock corresponding to a device and wait
for superblock to be unfrozen. However this waiting has to happen without
s_umount semaphore because that is required for superblock to thaw. So provide
a function in VFS for this to keep dances with s_umount where they belong.

[AV: implementation switched to saner variant]
