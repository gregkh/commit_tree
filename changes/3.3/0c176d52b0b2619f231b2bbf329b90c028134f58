mm: hugetlb: fix pgoff computation when unmapping page from vma

The computation for pgoff is incorrect, at least with

	(vma->vm_pgoff >> PAGE_SHIFT)

involved.  It is fixed with the available method if HPAGE_SIZE is
concerned in page cache lookup.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: use vma_hugecache_offset() directly, per Michal]
