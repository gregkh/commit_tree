Btrfs: don't call btrfs_throttle in file write

Btrfs_throttle will make us wait if there is a currently committing transaction
until we can open new transactions, which is ridiculous since we don't actually
start any transactions within the file write path anyway, so all this does is
introduce big latencies if we have a sync/fsync heavy workload going on while
somebody else is trying to do work.  Thanks,
