x86/PCI: convert to pci_create_root_bus() and pci_scan_root_bus()

x86 has two kinds of PCI root bus scanning:

(1) ACPI-based, using _CRS resources.  This used pci_create_bus(), not
    pci_scan_bus(), because ACPI hotplug needed to split the
    pci_bus_add_devices() into a separate host bridge .start() method.

    This patch parses the _CRS resources earlier, so we can build a list of
    resources and pass it to pci_create_root_bus().

    Note that as before, we parse the _CRS even if we aren't going to use
    it so we can print it for debugging purposes.

(2) All other, which used either default resources (ioport_resource and
    iomem_resource) or information read from the hardware via amd_bus.c or
    similar.  This used pci_scan_bus().

    This patch converts x86_pci_root_bus_res_quirks() (previously called
    from pcibios_fixup_bus()) to x86_pci_root_bus_resources(), which builds
    a list of resources before we call pci_scan_root_bus().

    We also use x86_pci_root_bus_resources() if we have ACPI but are
    ignoring _CRS.
