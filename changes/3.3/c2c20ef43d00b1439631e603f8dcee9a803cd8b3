bnx2: Update driver to use new mips firmware.

bnx2-mips-06-6.2.3 and bnx2-mips-09-6.2.1.b

New firmware fixes iSCSI problems with some LeftHand targets that don't
set TTT=0xffffffff for Data-In according to spec.  Firmware generates
exception warnings for this condition and becomes very slow.  This is
fixed by suppressing these warnings when using default error mask.
