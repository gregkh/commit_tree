OK I found it, I did some extra tests and believe its ready.

[PATCH net-next] ipv4: IP_PKTINFO doesnt need dst reference

When a socket uses IP_PKTINFO notifications, we currently force a dst
reference for each received skb. Reader has to access dst to get needed
information (rt_iif & rt_spec_dst) and must release dst reference.

We also forced a dst reference if skb was put in socket backlog, even
without IP_PKTINFO handling. This happens under stress/load.

We can instead store the needed information in skb->cb[], so that only
softirq handler really access dst, improving cache hit ratios.

This removes two atomic operations per packet, and false sharing as
well.

On a benchmark using a mono threaded receiver (doing only recvmsg()
calls), I can reach 720.000 pps instead of 570.000 pps.

IP_PKTINFO is typically used by DNS servers, and any multihomed aware
UDP application.
