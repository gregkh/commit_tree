arm/tegra: Add AUXDATA for tegra-pinmux and tegra-gpio

The pinctrl device name is included in the pinctrl map table, and used
as a parameter to pin_config_*() functions. Hence, it must be the same
for non-DT and DT kernels. Add AUXDATA to cause this.

The GPIO device name will be used by the pinmux/GPIO initialization code
in a later patch, and needs to stay constant.
