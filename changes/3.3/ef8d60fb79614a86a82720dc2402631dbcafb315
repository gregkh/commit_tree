ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix surround output regression on Acer Aspire 5935

The previous fix for the speaker on Acer Aspire 59135 introduced
another problem for surround outputs.  It changed the connections on
the line-in/mic pins for limiting the routes, but it left the modified
connections.  Thus wrong connection indices were written when set to
4ch or 6ch mode.

This patch fixes it by restoring the right connections just after
parsing the tree but before the initialization.
