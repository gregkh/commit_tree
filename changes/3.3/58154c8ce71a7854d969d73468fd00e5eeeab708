powerpc: Give us time to get all oopses out before panicking

I've been seeing truncated output when people send system reset info
to me. We should see a backtrace for every CPU, but the panic() code
takes the box down before they all make it out to the console. The
panic code runs unlocked so we also see corrupted console output.

If we are going to panic, then delay 1 second before calling into the
panic code. Move oops_exit inside the die lock and put a newline
between oopses for clarity.
