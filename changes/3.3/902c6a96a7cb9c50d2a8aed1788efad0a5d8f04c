dm ioctl: do not leak argv if target message only contains whitespace

If 'argc' is zero we jump to the 'out:' label, but this leaks the
(unused) memory that 'dm_split_args()' allocated for 'argv' if the
string being split consisted entirely of whitespace.  Jump to the
'out_argv:' label instead to free up that memory.
