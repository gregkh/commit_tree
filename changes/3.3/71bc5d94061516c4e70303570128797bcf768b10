asix: fix setting custom MAC address on Asix 88178 devices

In kernel v3.2 initialization sequence for Asix 88178 devices was changed so
that hardware is reseted on every time interface is brought up (ifconfig up),
instead just at USB probe time. This causes problem with setting custom MAC
address to device as ax88178_reset causes reload of MAC address from EEPROM.

This patch fixes the issue by rewriting MAC address at end of ax88178_reset.
