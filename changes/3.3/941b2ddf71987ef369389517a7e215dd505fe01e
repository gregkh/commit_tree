btrfs: Sector Size check during Mount

Gracefully fail when trying to mount a BTRFS file system that has a
sectorsize smaller than PAGE_SIZE.

On PPC it is possible to build a FS while using a 4k PAGE_SIZE kernel
then boot into a 64K PAGE_SIZE kernel.  Presently open_ctree fails in an
endless loop and hangs the machine in this situation.

My debugging has show this Sector size < Page size to be a non trivial
situation and a graceful exit from the situation would be nice for the
time being.
