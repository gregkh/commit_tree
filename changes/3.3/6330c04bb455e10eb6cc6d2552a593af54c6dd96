sh: Ensure IRQs are enabled across do_notify_resume().

do_notify_resume() can trigger the freezer via the try_to_freeze() path
(both explicitly through a redundant call in do_signal() or via
get_signal_to_deliver()). That IRQs were disabled across this callsite

	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/freezer.h:45
	in_atomic(): 0, irqs_disabled(): 1, pid: 819, name: ntpd
