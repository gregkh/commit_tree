drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c: clear dangling pointer

On some failures, the country_code field of an acm structure is freed
without freeing the acm structure itself.  Elsewhere, operations including
memcpy and kfree are performed on the country_code field.  The patch sets
the country_code field to NULL when it is freed, and likewise sets the
country_code_size field to 0.
