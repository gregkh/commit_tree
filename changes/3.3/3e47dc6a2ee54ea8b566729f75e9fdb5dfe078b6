ARM: OMAP3+: hwmod data: Add the default clockactivity for I2C

For I2C clockactivity field is added for OMAP3 and OMAP4 that defines how the
interface (OCP) and functional (system) clocks behave when the I2C module is
idle.

The configuration of the clock activity bit field (per TRM) is as follows:
0x0: Both clocks can be cut off
0x1: Only OCP clock must be kept active; system clock
     can be cut off
0x3: Both clocks must be kept active
0x2: Only system clock must be kept active; OCP clock
     can be cut off

The patch makes 0x2(CLOCKACT_TEST_ICLK) the default for OMAP3 and OMAP4.
