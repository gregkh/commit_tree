drm/i915/sdvo: always set positive sync polarity

This is a revert of 81a14b46846fea0741902e8d8dfcc6c6c78154c8.

We already set the mode polarity using the SDVO commands with struct
intel_sdvo_dtd. We have at least 3 bugs that get fixed with this patch.
The documentation, despite not clear, can also be interpreted in a way
that suggests this patch is needed.
