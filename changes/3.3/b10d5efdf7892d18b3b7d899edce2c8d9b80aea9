Documentation update for the driver model core

This patch (as1509) documents two important points regarding the use
of device structures in the driver model:

	Structures must be initialized to all 0's before they are
	passed to device_initialize().

	Structures must not be passed to device_add() or
	device_register() more than once.

Although these restrictions have applied ever since the driver model
was first created, they have not been mentioned anywhere.
