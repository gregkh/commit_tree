nohz: Separate out irq exit and idle loop dyntick logic

The tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() function, which tries to delay
the next timer tick as long as possible, can be called from two
places:

- From the idle loop to start the dytick idle mode
- From interrupt exit if we have interrupted the dyntick
idle mode, so that we reprogram the next tick event in
case the irq changed some internal state that requires this
action.

There are only few minor differences between both that
are handled by that function, driven by the ts->inidle
cpu variable and the inidle parameter. The whole guarantees
that we only update the dyntick mode on irq exit if we actually
interrupted the dyntick idle mode, and that we enter in RCU extended
quiescent state from idle loop entry only.

Split this function into:

- tick_nohz_idle_enter(), which sets ts->inidle to 1, enters
dynticks idle mode unconditionally if it can, and enters into RCU
extended quiescent state.

- tick_nohz_irq_exit() which only updates the dynticks idle mode
when ts->inidle is set (ie: if tick_nohz_idle_enter() has been called).

To maintain symmetry, tick_nohz_restart_sched_tick() has been renamed
into tick_nohz_idle_exit().

This simplifies the code and micro-optimize the irq exit path (no need
for local_irq_save there). This also prepares for the split between
dynticks and rcu extended quiescent state logics. We'll need this split to
further fix illegal uses of RCU in extended quiescent states in the idle
loop.
