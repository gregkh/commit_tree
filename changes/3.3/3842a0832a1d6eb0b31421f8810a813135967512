rcu: Document same-context read-side constraints

The intent is that a given RCU read-side critical section be confined
to a single context.  For example, it is illegal to invoke rcu_read_lock()
in an exception handler and then invoke rcu_read_unlock() from the
context of the task that received the exception.
