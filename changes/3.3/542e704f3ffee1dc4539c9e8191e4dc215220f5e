pinctrl: GPIO direction support for muxing

When requesting a single GPIO pin to be muxed in, some controllers
will need to poke a different value into the control register
depending on whether the pin will be used for GPIO output or GPIO
input. So create pinmux counterparts to gpio_direction_[input|output]
in the pinctrl framework.

ChangeLog v1->v2:
- This also amends the documentation to make it clear the this
  function and associated machinery is *ONLY* intended as a backend
  to gpiolib machinery, not for everyone and his dog to start playing
  around with pins.
ChangeLog v2->v3:
- Don't pass an argument to the common request function, instead
  provide pinmux_* counterparts to the gpio_direction_[input|output]
  calls, simpler and anyone can understand it.
ChangeLog v3->v4:
- Fix numerous spelling mistakes and dangling text in documentation.
  Add Ack and Rewewed-by.
