x86: Reduce clock calibration time during slave cpu startup

Reduce the startup time for slave cpus.

Adds hooks for an arch-specific function for clock calibration.
These hooks are used on x86.  If a newly started cpu has the
same phys_proc_id as a core already active, uses the TSC for the
delay loop and has a CONSTANT_TSC, use the already-calculated
value of loops_per_jiffy.

This patch reduces the time required to start slave cpus on a
4096 cpu system from: 465 sec OLD 62 sec NEW

This reduces boot time on a 4096p system by almost 7 minutes.
Nice...
