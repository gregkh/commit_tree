ftrace: Allow archs to modify code without stop machine

The stop machine method to modify all functions in the kernel
(some 20,000 of them) is the safest way to do so across all archs.
But some archs may not need this big hammer approach to modify code
on SMP machines, and can simply just update the code it needs.

Adding a weak function arch_ftrace_update_code() that now does the
stop machine, will also let any arch override this method.

If the arch needs to check the system and then decide if it can
avoid stop machine, it can still call ftrace_run_stop_machine() to
use the old method.
