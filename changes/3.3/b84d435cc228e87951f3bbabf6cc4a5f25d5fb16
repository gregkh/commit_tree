debugobjects: Extend to assert that an object is initialized

Calling del_timer_sync() on an uninitialized timer leads to a
never ending loop in lock_timer_base() that spins checking for a
non-NULL timer base. Add an assertion to debugobjects to catch
usage of uninitialized objects so that we can initialize timers
in the del_timer_sync() path before it calls lock_timer_base().
