inetpeer: Invalidate the inetpeer tree along with the routing cache

We initialize the routing metrics with the values cached on the
inetpeer in rt_init_metrics(). So if we have the metrics cached on the
inetpeer, we ignore the user configured fib_metrics.

To fix this issue, we replace the old tree with a fresh initialized
inet_peer_base. The old tree is removed later with a delayed work queue.
