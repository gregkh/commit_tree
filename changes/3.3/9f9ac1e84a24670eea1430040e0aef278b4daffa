ARM: OMAP2+: UART: Remove context_save and move context restore to driver

Remove context save function from serial.c and move context restore
function to omap-serial. Remove all regs stored in omap_uart_state
for contex_save/restore, reg read write funcs used in context_save/restore,
io_addresses populated for read/write funcs.

Clock gating mechanism was done in serial.c and had no info on uart state
thus we needed context save and restore in serial.c
With runtime conversion and clock gating done within uart driver
context restore can be done from regs value available from uart_omap_port
structure.
