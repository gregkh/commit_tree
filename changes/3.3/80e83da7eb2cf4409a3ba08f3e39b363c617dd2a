iwlagn: dynamically allocate & reflect calibration data

This makes handling the calibration data more generic
and no longer requires updating IWL_CALIB_MAX when a
new uCode comes with more calibration packets. Since
we just copy the data back, there's also no need for
understanding which calibration we received -- we can
just reflect it back to the runtime uCode.
