checkpatch: optimise statement scanner when mid-statement

In the middle of a long definition or similar, there is no possibility of
finding a smaller sub-statement.  Optimise this case by skipping statement
aquirey where there are no starts of statement (open brace '{' or
semi-colon ';').  We are likely to scan slightly more than needed still
but this is safest.
