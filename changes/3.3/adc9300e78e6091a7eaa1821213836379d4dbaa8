net: use jump_label to shortcut RPS if not setup

Most machines dont use RPS/RFS, and pay a fair amount of instructions in
netif_receive_skb() / netif_rx() / get_rps_cpu() just to discover
RPS/RFS is not setup.

Add a jump_label named rps_needed.

If no device rps_map or global rps_sock_flow_table is setup,
netif_receive_skb() / netif_rx() do a single instruction instead of many
ones, including conditional jumps.

jmp +0    (if CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL=y)
