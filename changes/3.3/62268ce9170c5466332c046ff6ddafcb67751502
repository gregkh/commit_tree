dmaengine: add DMA_TRANS_NONE to dma_transfer_direction

Before dma_transfer_direction was introduced to replace
dma_data_direction, some dmaengine device uses DMA_NONE of
dma_data_direction for some talk with its client drivers.
The mxs-dma and its clients mxs-mmc and gpmi-nand are such case.

This patch adds DMA_TRANS_NONE to dma_transfer_direction and
migrate the DMA_NONE use in mxs-dma to it.

It also fixes the compile warning below.

CC      drivers/dma/mxs-dma.o
drivers/dma/mxs-dma.c: In function ‘mxs_dma_prep_slave_sg’:
drivers/dma/mxs-dma.c:420:16: warning: comparison between ‘enum dma_transfer_direction’ and ‘enum dma_data_direction’
