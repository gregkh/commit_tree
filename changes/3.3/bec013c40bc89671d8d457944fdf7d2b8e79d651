kdump: crashk_res init check for /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size

Currently it is possible to set the crash_size via the sysfs
/sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size even if no crash kernel memory has been
defined with the "crashkernel" parameter.  In this case "crashk_res" is
not initialized and crashk_res.start = crashk_res.end = 0.  Unfortunately
resource_size(&crashk_res) returns 1 in this case.  This breaks the s390
implementation of crash_(un)map_reserved_pages().

To fix the problem the correct "old_size" is now calculated in
crash_shrink_memory().  "old_size is set to "0" if crashk_res is not
initialized.  With this change crash_shrink_memory() will do nothing, when
"crashk_res" is not initialized.  It will return "0" for "echo 0 >
/sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size" and -EINVAL for "echo [not zero] >
/sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size".

In addition to that this patch also simplifies the "ret = -EINVAL" vs.
"ret = 0" logic as suggested by Simon Horman.
