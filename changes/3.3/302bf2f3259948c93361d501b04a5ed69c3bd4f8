ext2/3/4: delete unneeded includes of module.h

Delete any instances of include module.h that were not strictly
required.  In the case of ext2, the declaration of MODULE_LICENSE
etc. were in inode.c but the module_init/exit were in super.c, so
relocate the MODULE_LICENCE/AUTHOR block to super.c which makes it
consistent with ext3 and ext4 at the same time.
