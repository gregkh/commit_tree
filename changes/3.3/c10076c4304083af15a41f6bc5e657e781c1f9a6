tracepoints/module: Fix disabling tracepoints with taint CRAP or OOT

Tracepoints are disabled for tainted modules, which is usually because the
module is either proprietary or was forced, and we don't want either of them
using kernel tracepoints.

But, a module can also be tainted by being in the staging directory or
compiled out of tree. Either is fine for use with tracepoints, no need
to punish them.  I found this out when I noticed that my sample trace event
module, when done out of tree, stopped working.
