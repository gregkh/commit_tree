nohz: Remove tick_nohz_idle_enter_norcu() / tick_nohz_idle_exit_norcu()

Those two APIs were provided to optimize the calls of
tick_nohz_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_enter() into a single
irq disabled section. This way no interrupt happening in-between would
needlessly process any RCU job.

Now we are talking about an optimization for which benefits
have yet to be measured. Let's start simple and completely decouple
idle rcu and dyntick idle logics to simplify.
