mac80211: Support ht-cap over-rides.

This implements ht-cap over-rides for mac80211 drivers.
HT may be disabled, making an /a/b/g/n station act like an
a/b/g station.  HT40 may be disabled forcing the station to
be HT20 even if the AP and local hardware support HT40.

MAX-AMSDU may be disabled.
AMPDU-Density may be increased.
AMPDU-Factor may be decreased.

This has been successfully tested with ath9k using patched
wpa_supplicant and iw.
