bonding: fix error handling if slave is busy (v2)

If slave device already has a receive handler registered, then the
error unwind of bonding device enslave function is broken.

The following will leave a pointer to freed memory in the slave
device list, causing a later kernel panic.
# modprobe dummy
# ip li add dummy0-1 link dummy0 type macvlan
# modprobe bonding
# echo +dummy0 >/sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves

The fix is to detach the slave (which removes it from the list)
in the unwind path.
