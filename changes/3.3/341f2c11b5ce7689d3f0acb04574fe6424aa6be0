wl12xx: avoid bail out when probe-resp is not set by mac80211

During reconfig we can get the BSS_CHANGED_AP_PROBE_RESP indication
even if a probe-resp has not been set in the first place. Therefore
ignore the error when not getting a probe-resp from mac80211. Resort to
the legacy probe-resp in this case.

Also take this opportunity to add a vif argument to the set_probe_resp
function.
