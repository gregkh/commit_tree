sched: Clean up domain traversal in select_idle_sibling()

Instead of going through the scheduler domain hierarchy multiple times
(for giving priority to an idle core over an idle SMT sibling in a busy
core), start with the highest scheduler domain with the SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES
flag and traverse the domain hierarchy down till we find an idle group.

This cleanup also addresses an issue reported by Mike where the recent
changes returned the busy thread even in the presence of an idle SMT
sibling in single socket platforms.
