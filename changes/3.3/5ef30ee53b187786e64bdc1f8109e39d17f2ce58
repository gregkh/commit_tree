audit: make filetype matching consistent with other filters

Every other filter that matches part of the inodes list collected by audit
will match against any of the inodes on that list.  The filetype matching
however had a strange way of doing things.  It allowed userspace to
indicated if it should match on the first of the second name collected by
the kernel.  Name collection ordering seems like a kernel internal and
making userspace rules get that right just seems like a bad idea.  As it
turns out the userspace audit writers had no idea it was doing this and
thus never overloaded the value field.  The kernel always checked the first
name collected which for the tested rules was always correct.

This patch just makes the filetype matching like the major, minor, inode,
and LSM rules in that it will match against any of the names collected.  It
also changes the rule validation to reject the old unused rule types.

Noone knew it was there.  Noone used it.  Why keep around the extra code?
