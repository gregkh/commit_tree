cgroup: remove redundant get/put of old css_set from migrate

We can now assume that the css_set reference held by the task
will not go away for an exiting task. PF_EXITING state can be
trusted throughout migration by checking it after locking
threadgroup.

Changes in V4:
* https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/12/20/368 (Tejun Heo)
  * Fix typo in commit message
  * Undid the rename of css_set_check_fetched
* https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/12/20/427 (Li Zefan)

Changes in V3:

Changes in V2:
