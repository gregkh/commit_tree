[media] dw2102: use symbolic names for dw2102_table indices

dw2102_properties et al refer to entries in the USB-id table using
hard-coded indices, as in "&dw2102_table[6]", which means adding new
entries before the end of the list has the potential to introduce bugs
in code elsewhere in the file.

Use C99-style initializers with symbolic names for each index to avoid
this.  This way, other device tables wanting to reuse the USB ids can
use expressions like "&dw2102_table[TEVII_S630]" that do not change as
the entries in the table are reordered.
