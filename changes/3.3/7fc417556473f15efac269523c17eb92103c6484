rt2800lib: fix wrong -128dBm when signal is stronger than -12dBm

This patch correct the type of variables containing the rssi
values read from the rxwi.

In function rt2800_agc_to_rssi() 3 variables (rssi0, rssi1, rss2)
defined as int was assigned a 16bit signed values as unsigned.
From a test with a hi-gain antenna I verified that the rxwi
contains signed rssi values in the  range -13/+81 (inclusive)
with 0 as an error condition. In case of negative values a
condition is triggered and the function return -128dBm while
the signal is at its maximum. This patch correct the cast so
negative values are not treated as very high positive values
(ex. -13 does not become 243).
