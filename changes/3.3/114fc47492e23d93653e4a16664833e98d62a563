ceph: change "ceph.layout" xattr to be "ceph.file.layout"

The virtual extended attribute named "ceph.layout" is meaningful
only for regular files.  Change its name to be "ceph.file.layout" to
more directly reflect that in the ceph xattr namespace.  Preserve
the old "ceph.layout" name for the time being (until we decide it's
safe to get rid of it entirely).

Add a missing initializer for "readonly" in the terminating entry.
