block, cfq: reorganize cfq_io_context into generic and cfq specific parts

Currently io_context and cfq logics are mixed without clear boundary.
Most of io_context is independent from cfq but cfq_io_context handling
logic is dispersed between generic ioc code and cfq.

cfq_io_context represents association between an io_context and a
request_queue, which is a concept useful outside of cfq, but it also
contains fields which are useful only to cfq.

This patch takes out generic part and put it into io_cq (io
context-queue) and the rest into cfq_io_cq (cic moniker remains the
same) which contains io_cq.  The following changes are made together.

* cfq_ttime and cfq_io_cq now live in cfq-iosched.c.

* All related fields, functions and constants are renamed accordingly.

* ioc->ioc_data is now "struct io_cq *" instead of "void *" and
  renamed to icq_hint.

This prepares for io_context API cleanup.  Documentation is currently
sparse.  It will be added later.

Changes in this patch are mechanical and don't cause functional
change.
