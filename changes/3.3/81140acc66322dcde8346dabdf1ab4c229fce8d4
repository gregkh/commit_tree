lockdep: Print lock name in lockdep_init_error()

This patch prints the name of the lock which is acquired
before lockdep_init() is called, so that users can easily
find which lock triggered the lockdep init error warning.

This patch also removes the lockdep_init_error() message
of "Arch code didn't call lockdep_init() early enough?"
since lockdep_init() is called in arch independent code now.
