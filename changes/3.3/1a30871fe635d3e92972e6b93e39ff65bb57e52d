mtd: fix MTD suspend

Commits 3fe4bae88460869a8e553397cd9057a4ee7ca341 and
079c985e7a6f4ce60f931cebfdd5ee3c3 broke MTD suspend in 2 ways:

1. When the '->suspend' method is not present, we return -EOPNOTSUPP, but
   the callers of 'mtd_suspend()' expects 0 instead.
2. Checking of the 'mtd' parameter against NULL has been incorrectly removed
   in 'mtd_cls_suspend()'.

This patch fixes the breakages. This has been found, analyzed, reported
and tested by Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>.

Note, this patch is not needed in the stable tree because it causes a
regression introduced during the v3.3 merge window.
