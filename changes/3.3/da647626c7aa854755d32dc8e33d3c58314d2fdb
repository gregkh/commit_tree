ath9k: change maximum software retransmission handling

Instead of limiting a subframe to 10 A-MPDU software transmission attempts,
count hardware retransmissions as well and raise the limit a bit. That way
there will be fewer software retransmission attempts when traffic suffers
from lots of hardware retransmissions.
