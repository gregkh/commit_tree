x86-64: Reduce amount of redundant code generated for invalidate_interruptNN

Previously these up to 32 entry points, consisting of all the
same code except for their very first instruction, consumed 0x70
bytes per instance. Just like for device interrupt entry points,
fold them together so that they all use a single instance of the
code after having pushed their vector indicator (resulting in
0x10 bytes per instance, to retain 16-byte alignment of the
individual entry points).
