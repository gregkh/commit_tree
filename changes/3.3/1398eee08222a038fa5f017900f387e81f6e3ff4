net: decrement memcg jump label when limit, not usage, is changed

The logic of the current code is that whenever we destroy
a cgroup that had its limit set (set meaning different than
maximum), we should decrement the jump_label counter.
Otherwise we assume it was never incremented.

But what the code actually does is test for RES_USAGE
instead of RES_LIMIT. Usage being different than maximum
is likely to be true most of the time.

The effect of this is that the key must become negative,
and since the jump_label test says:

        !!atomic_read(&key->enabled);

we'll have jump_labels still on when no one else is
using this functionality.
