b43legacy: Avoid packet losses in the dma worker code

This patch addresses a bug in the dma worker code that keeps draining
packets even when the hardware queues are full. In such cases packets
can not be passed down to the device and are erroneusly dropped by the
code. It is based on commit bad6919469662b7c92bc6353642aaaa777b36bac,
which fixes the same problem in b43.
