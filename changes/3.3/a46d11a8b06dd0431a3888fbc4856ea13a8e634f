Btrfs: add BTRFS_AVAIL_ALLOC_BIT_SINGLE bit

Right now on-disk BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_* profile bits are used for
avail_{data,metadata,system}_alloc_bits fields, which gather info about
available allocation profiles in the FS.  When chunk is created or read
from disk, its profile is OR'ed with the corresponding avail_alloc_bits
field.  Since SINGLE is denoted by 0 in the on-disk format, currently
there is no way to tell when such chunks become avaialble.  Restriper
needs that information, so add a separate bit for SINGLE profile.

This bit is going to be in-memory only, it should never be written out
to disk, so it's not a disk format change.  However to avoid remappings
in future, reserve corresponding on-disk bit.
