powerpc/fsl-pci: Don't hide resource for pci/e when configured as Agent/EP

Current pci/pcie init code will hide the pci/pcie host resource.
But did not judge it is host/RC or agent/EP. If configured as
agent/EP, we should avoid hiding its resource in the host side.

In PCI system, the Programing Interface can be used to judge the
host/agent status:
Programing Interface = 0: host
Programing Interface = 1: Agent

In PCIE system, both the Programing Interface and Header type can
be used to judge the RC/EP status.
Header Type = 0: EP
Header Type = 1: RC
