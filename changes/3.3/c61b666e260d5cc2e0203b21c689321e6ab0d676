tipc: Improve handling of media address printing errors

Enhances conversion of a media address to printable form so that an
unconvertable address will be displayed as a string of hex digits,
rather than not being displayed at all. (Also removes a pointless check
for the existence of the media-specific address conversion routine,
since the routine is not optional.)
