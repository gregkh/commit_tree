jbd: Remove j_barrier mutex

j_barrier mutex is used for serializing different journal lock operations.  The
problem with it is that e.g. FIFREEZE ioctl results in process leaving kernel
with j_barrier mutex held which makes lockdep freak out. Also hibernation code
wants to freeze filesystem but it cannot do so because it then cannot hibernate
the system because of mutex being locked.

So we remove j_barrier mutex and use direct wait on j_barrier_count instead.
Since locking journal is a rare operation we don't have to care about fairness
or such things.
