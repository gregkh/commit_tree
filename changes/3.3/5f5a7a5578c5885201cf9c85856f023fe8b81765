serial: samsung: switch to clkdev based clock lookup

Instead of using clock names supplied in platform data, use a generic
clock name 'clk_uart_baud' to look up clocks. The platform code should
register clocks with the name 'clk_uart_baud' which can be used by the
baud rate generator. The clock lookup and selection of the best clock
as baud rate clock is reworked.

Platform code can specify the clocks that can be used as source for the
baud clock (as supported previously by passing names of clocks). A new
member is added to the platform data 'clk_sel' which holds a bit-field
value with each bit representing a baud source clock. If a bit at any
bit position is set, that clock is looked up to participate in the
selection of the baud clock source.
