GFS2: combine gfs2_alloc_block and gfs2_alloc_di

GFS2 functions gfs2_alloc_block and gfs2_alloc_di do basically
the same things, with a few exceptions. This patch combines
the two functions into a slightly more generic gfs2_alloc_block.
Having one centralized block allocation function will reduce
code redundancy and make it easier to implement multi-block
reservations to reduce file fragmentation in the future.
