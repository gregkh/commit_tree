[media] usbvision: Drop broken 10-bit I2C address support

The support for 10-bit I2C addresses in usbvision seems plain broken
to me. I had already noticed that back in February 2007 [1]. The code
was not fixed since then, so I take it that it's not actually needed.
And as a matter of fact I don't know of any 10-bit addressed I2C
tuner, encode, decoder or the like.

So let's simply get rid of the broken and useless code.

I'm also adding I2C_FUNC_I2C, as the driver and hardware support plain
I2C messaging.
