i387: export 'fpu_owner_task' per-cpu variable

(And define it properly for x86-32, which had its 'current_task'
declaration in separate from x86-64)

Bitten by my dislike for modules on the machines I use, and the fact
that apparently nobody else actually wanted to test the patches I sent
out.

Snif. Nobody else cares.

Anyway, we probably should uninline the 'kernel_fpu_begin()' function
that is what modules actually use and that references this, but this is
the minimal fix for now.
