ARM: 7320/1: Fix proc_info table alignment

With an admittedly exotic choice of configuration options
(CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE, THUMB2, some other size-minimizing ones)
and compiler, the proc_info table can end up being misaligned,
and the kernel being unbootable (Error: unrecognized/unsupported
processor variant).

Forcing the alignement to 4 bytes in the linker script fixes the
issue.
