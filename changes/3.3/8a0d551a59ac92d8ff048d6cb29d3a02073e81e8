nfs: fix regression in handling of context= option in NFSv4

Setting the security context of a NFSv4 mount via the context= mount
option is currently broken. The NFSv4 codepath allocates a parsed
options struct, and then parses the mount options to fill it. It
eventually calls nfs4_remote_mount which calls security_init_mnt_opts.
That clobbers the lsm_opts struct that was populated earlier. This bug
also looks like it causes a small memory leak on each v4 mount where
context= is used.

Fix this by moving the initialization of the lsm_opts into
nfs_alloc_parsed_mount_data. Also, add a destructor for
nfs_parsed_mount_data to make it easier to free all of the allocations
hanging off of it, and to ensure that the security_free_mnt_opts is
called whenever security_init_mnt_opts is.

I believe this regression was introduced quite some time ago, probably
by commit c02d7adf.
