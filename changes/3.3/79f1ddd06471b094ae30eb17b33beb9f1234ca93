x86: Use the same node_distance for 32 and 64-bit

The node_distance function is not x86 64-bit specific.  Having
the #ifdef around the extern function declaration and the
 #define causes the default node_distance macro to be used in
asm-generic/topology.h. This also causes a sparse warning in
arch/x86/mm/numa.c when CONFIG_X86_64 is not set:

warning: symbol '__node_distance' was not declared. Should it be
static?

Remove the #ifdef to fix both issues.
