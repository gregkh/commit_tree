[S390] kvm: move cmf host id constant out of lowcore

There is no reason for the cpu-measurement-facility host id constant to
reside in the lowcore where space is precious. Use an entry in the literal
pool in HANDLE_SIE_INTERCEPT and a stack slot in sie64a.
While we are at it replace the id -1 with 0 to indicate host execution.
