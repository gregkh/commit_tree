ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: Add names for DMIC memory address space

To be able to get the memory resources by name from
the DMIC driver (for MPU and for DMA).

Without this patch, functionality that was working in 3.2 breaks in
3.3-rc1.  This patch should have gone in as part of the 3.3 merge
window, but was inadvertently missed.
