ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: disable multiblock reads on MMC1/2 on OMAP34xx/35xx <= ES2.1

The HSMMC1/HSMMC2 host controllers on OMAP34xx and
OMAP3503/3515/3525/3530 chips at ES levels prior to 3.0 can't do multiple
block reads[1].  Mark the hwmod data appropriately.

Reported by Dave Hylands <dhylands@gmail.com> and Steve Sakoman
<sakoman@gmail.com>.  Thanks to Steve Sakoman for further help
testing this patch.
