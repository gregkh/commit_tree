fanotify: mix event info and pid into merge key hash

Improve the merge key hash by mixing more values relevant for merge.

For example, all FAN_CREATE name events in the same dir used to have the
same merge key based on the dir inode.  With this change the created
file name is mixed into the merge key.

The object id that was used as merge key is redundant to the event info
so it is no longer mixed into the hash.

Permission events are not hashed, so no need to hash their info.
