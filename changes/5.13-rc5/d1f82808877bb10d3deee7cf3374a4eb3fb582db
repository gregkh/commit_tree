io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers

Read and write operations are capped to MAX_RW_COUNT. Some read ops rely on
that limit, and that is not guaranteed by the IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS.

Truncate those lengths when doing io_add_buffers, so buffer addresses still
use the uncapped length.

Also, take the chance and change struct io_buffer len member to __u32, so
it matches struct io_provide_buffer len member.

This fixes CVE-2021-3491, also reported as ZDI-CAN-13546.
