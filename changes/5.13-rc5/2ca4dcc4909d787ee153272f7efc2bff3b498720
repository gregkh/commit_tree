fs/mount_setattr: tighten permission checks

We currently don't have any filesystems that support idmapped mounts
which are mountable inside a user namespace. That was a deliberate
decision for now as a userns root can just mount the filesystem
themselves. So enforce this restriction explicitly until there's a real
use-case for this. This way we can notice it and will have a chance to
adapt and audit our translation helpers and fstests appropriately if we
need to support such filesystems.
