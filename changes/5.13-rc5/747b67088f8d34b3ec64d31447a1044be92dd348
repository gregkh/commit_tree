xfrm: ipcomp: remove unnecessary get_cpu()

While testing ipcomp on a realtime kernel, Xiumei reported a "sleeping
in atomic" bug, caused by a memory allocation while preemption is
disabled (ipcomp_decompress -> alloc_page -> ... get_page_from_freelist).

As Sebastian noted [1], this get_cpu() isn't actually needed, since
ipcomp_decompress() is called in napi context anyway, so BH is already
disabled.

This patch replaces get_cpu + per_cpu_ptr with this_cpu_ptr, then
simplifies the error returns, since there isn't any common operation
left.
