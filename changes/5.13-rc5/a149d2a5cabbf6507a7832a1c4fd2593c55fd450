ext4: fix check to prevent false positive report of incorrect used inodes

Commit <50122847007> ("ext4: fix check to prevent initializing reserved
inodes") check the block group zero and prevent initializing reserved
inodes. But in some special cases, the reserved inode may not all belong
to the group zero, it may exist into the second group if we format
filesystem below.

  mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -g 8192 -N 1024 -I 4096 /dev/sda

So, it will end up triggering a false positive report of a corrupted
file system. This patch fix it by avoid check reserved inodes if no free
inode blocks will be zeroed.
