afs: Use new netfs lib read helper API

Make AFS use the new netfs read helpers to implement the VM read
operations:

 - afs_readpage() now hands off responsibility to netfs_readpage().

 - afs_readpages() is gone and replaced with afs_readahead().

 - afs_readahead() just hands off responsibility to netfs_readahead().

These make use of the cache if a cookie is supplied, otherwise just call
the ->issue_op() method a sufficient number of times to complete the entire
request.

Changes:
v5:
- Use proper wait function for PG_fscache in afs_page_mkwrite()[1].
- Use killable wait for PG_writeback in afs_page_mkwrite()[1].

v4:
- Folded in error handling fixes to afs_req_issue_op().
- Added flag to netfs_subreq_terminated() to indicate that the caller may
  have been running async and stuff that might sleep needs punting to a
  workqueue.
