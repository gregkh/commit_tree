HID: multitouch: require Finger field to mark Win8 reports as MT

This effectively changes collection_is_mt from
  contact ID in report->field
to
  (device is Win8 => collection is finger) && contact ID in report->field

Some devices erroneously report Pen for fingers, and Win8 stylus-on-touchscreen
devices report contact ID, but mark the accompanying touchscreen device's
collection correctly
