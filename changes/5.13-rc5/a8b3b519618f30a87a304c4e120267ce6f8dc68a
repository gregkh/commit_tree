USB: CDC-ACM: fix poison/unpoison imbalance

suspend() does its poisoning conditionally, resume() does it
unconditionally. On a device with combined interfaces this
will balance, on a device with two interfaces the counter will
go negative and resubmission will fail.

Both actions need to be done conditionally.
