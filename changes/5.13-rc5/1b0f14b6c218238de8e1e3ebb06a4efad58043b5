dpaa2-switch: create a central dpaa2_switch_acl_tbl structure

Introduce a new structure - dpaa2_switch_acl_tbl - to hold all data
related to an ACL table: number of rules added, ACL table id, etc.
This will be used more in the next patches when adding support for
sharing an ACL table between ports.
