mm/vmalloc: remove map_kernel_range

Patch series "mm/vmalloc: cleanup after hugepage series", v2.

Christoph pointed out some overdue cleanups required after the huge
vmalloc series, and I had another failure error message improvement as
well.

This patch (of 5):

This is a shim around vmap_pages_range, get rid of it.

Move the main API comment from the _noflush variant to the normal variant,
and make _noflush internal to mm/.
