powerpc/64s: Fix entry flush patching w/strict RWX & hash

The entry flush mitigation can be enabled/disabled at runtime. When this
happens it results in the kernel patching its own instructions to
enable/disable the mitigation sequence.

With strict kernel RWX enabled instruction patching happens via a
secondary mapping of the kernel text, so that we don't have to make the
primary mapping writable. With the hash MMU this leads to a hash fault,
which causes us to execute the exception entry which contains the entry
flush mitigation.

This means we end up executing the entry flush in a semi-patched state,
ie. after we have patched the first instruction but before we patch the
second or third instruction of the sequence.

On machines with updated firmware the entry flush is a series of special
nops, and it's safe to to execute in a semi-patched state.

However when using the fallback flush the sequence is mflr/branch/mtlr,
and so it's not safe to execute if we have patched out the mflr but not
the other two instructions. Doing so leads to us corrputing LR, leading
to an oops, for example:

  # echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/entry_flush
  kernel tried to execute exec-protected page (c000000002971000) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)

The simplest fix is to change the order in which we patch the
instructions, so that the sequence is always safe to execute. For the
non-fallback flushes it doesn't matter what order we patch in.
