powerpc/32: Move exception prolog code into .text once MMU is back on

The space in the head section is rather constrained by the fact that
exception vectors are spread every 0x100 bytes and sometimes we
need to have "out of line" code because it doesn't fit.

Now that we are enabling MMU early in the prolog, take that opportunity
to jump somewhere else in the .text section where we don't have any
space constraint.
