drm/panel-simple: Undo enable if HPD never asserts

If the HPD signal never asserts in panel_simple_prepare() and we
return an error, we should unset the enable GPIO and disable the
regulator to make it consistent for the caller.

At the moment I have some hardware where HPD sometimes doesn't assert.
Obviously that needs to be debugged, but this patch makes it so that
if I add a retry that I can make things work.
