staging: dpaa2-switch: fix up initial forwarding configuration done by firmware

By default, the DPSW object is configured with VLAN ID 1 in the VLAN
table, which all ports are member of. This entry in the VLAN table
selects the same FDB ID for all ports, meaning that forwarding between
ports is permitted. This is unlike the switchdev model, where each port
should operate as standalone by default.

To make the switch operate in standalone ports mode, we need the VLAN
table to select a unique FDB ID for each port. In order to do that, we
need to simply delete the VLAN 1 created automatically by firmware, and
let dpaa2_switch_port_init take over, by readding VLAN ID 1, but
pointing towards a unique FDB ID.
