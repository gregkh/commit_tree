kselftests: cgroup: update kmem test for new vmstat implementation

With memcg having switched to rstat, memory.stat output is precise.
Update the cgroup selftest to reflect the expectations and error
tolerances of the new implementation.

Also add newly tracked types of memory to the memory.stat side of the
equation, since they're included in memory.current and could throw false
positives.
