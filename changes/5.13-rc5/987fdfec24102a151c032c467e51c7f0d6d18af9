arm64: move --fix-cortex-a53-843419 linker test to Kconfig

Since commit 805b2e1d427a ("kbuild: include Makefile.compiler only when
compiler is needed"), "make ARCH=arm64 (modules_)install" shows a false
positive warning.

Move the ld-option test to Kconfig, so that the result can be stored in
the .config file, avoiding multiple-time evaluations in the build and
installation time.
