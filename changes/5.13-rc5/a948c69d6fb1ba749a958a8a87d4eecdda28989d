ring-buffer: Add verifier for using ring_buffer_event_time_stamp()

The ring_buffer_event_time_stamp() must be only called by an event that has
not been committed yet, and is on the buffer that is passed in. This was
used to help debug converting the histogram logic over to using the new
time stamp code, and was proven to be very useful.

Add a verifier that can check that this is the case, and extra WARN_ONs to
catch unexpected use cases.
