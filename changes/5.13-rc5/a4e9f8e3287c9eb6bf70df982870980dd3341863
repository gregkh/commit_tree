wireguard: peer: allocate in kmem_cache

With deployments having upwards of 600k peers now, this somewhat heavy
structure could benefit from more fine-grained allocations.
Specifically, instead of using a 2048-byte slab for a 1544-byte object,
we can now use 1544-byte objects directly, thus saving almost 25%
per-peer, or with 600k peers, that's a savings of 303 MiB. This also
makes wireguard's memory usage more transparent in tools like slabtop
and /proc/slabinfo.
