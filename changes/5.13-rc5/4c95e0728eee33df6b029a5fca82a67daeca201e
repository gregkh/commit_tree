netfilter: ebtables: remove the 3 ebtables pointers from struct net

ebtables stores the table internal data (what gets passed to the
ebt_do_table() interpreter) in struct net.

nftables keeps the internal interpreter format in pernet lists
and passes it via the netfilter core infrastructure (priv pointer).

Do the same for ebtables: the nf_hook_ops are duplicated via kmemdup,
then the ops->priv pointer is set to the table that is being registered.

After that, the netfilter core passes this table info to the hookfn.

This allows to remove the pointers from struct net.

Same pattern can be applied to ip/ip6/arptables.
