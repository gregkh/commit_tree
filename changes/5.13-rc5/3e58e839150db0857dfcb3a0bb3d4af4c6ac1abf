scripts: kernel-doc: add warning for comment not following kernel-doc syntax

Currently, kernel-doc start parsing the comment as a kernel-doc comment if
it starts with '/**', but does not take into account if the content inside
the comment too, adheres with the expected format.
This results in unexpected and unclear warnings for the user.

E.g., running scripts/kernel-doc -none mm/memcontrol.c emits:
"mm/memcontrol.c:961: warning: expecting prototype for do not fallback to current(). Prototype was for get_mem_cgroup_from_current() instead"

Here kernel-doc parses the corresponding comment as a kernel-doc comment
and expects prototype for it in the next lines, and as a result causing
this warning.

Provide a clearer warning message to the users regarding the same, if the
content inside the comment does not follow the kernel-doc expected format.
