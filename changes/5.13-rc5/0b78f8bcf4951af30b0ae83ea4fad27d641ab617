Revert "fb_defio: Remove custom address_space_operations"

Commit ccf953d8f3d6 makes framebuffers which use deferred I/O stop
displaying updates after the first one.  This is because the pages
handled by fb_defio no longer have a page_mapping().  That prevents
page_mkclean() from marking the PTEs as clean, and so writes are only
noticed the first time.
