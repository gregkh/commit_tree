erofs: introduce multipage per-CPU buffers

To deal the with the cases which inplace decompression is infeasible
for some inplace I/O. Per-CPU buffers was introduced to get rid of page
allocation latency and thrash for low-latency decompression algorithms
such as lz4.

For the big pcluster feature, introduce multipage per-CPU buffers to
keep such inplace I/O pclusters temporarily as well but note that
per-CPU pages are just consecutive virtually.

When a new big pcluster fs is mounted, its max pclustersize will be
read and per-CPU buffers can be growed if needed. Shrinking adjustable
per-CPU buffers is more complex (because we don't know if such size
is still be used), so currently just release them all when unloading.
