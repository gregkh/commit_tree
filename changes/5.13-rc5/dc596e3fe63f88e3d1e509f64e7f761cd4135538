net: dsa: sja1105: call dsa_unregister_switch when allocating memory fails

Unlike other drivers which pretty much end their .probe() execution with
dsa_register_switch(), the sja1105 does some extra stuff. When that
fails with -ENOMEM, the driver is quick to return that, forgetting to
call dsa_unregister_switch(). Not critical, but a bug nonetheless.
