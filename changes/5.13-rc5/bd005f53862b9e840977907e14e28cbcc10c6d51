mptcp: revert "mptcp: forbit mcast-related sockopt on MPTCP sockets"

This change reverts commit 86581852d771 ("mptcp: forbit mcast-related sockopt on MPTCP sockets").

As announced in the cover letter of the mentioned patch above, the
following commits introduce a larger MPTCP sockopt implementation
refactor.

This time, we switch from a blocklist to an allowlist. This is safer for
the future where new sockoptions could be added while not being fully
supported with MPTCP sockets and thus causing unstabilities.
