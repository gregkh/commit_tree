platform/chrome: cros_usbpd_notify: Listen to EC_HOST_EVENT_USB_MUX host event

On system that use ACPI, cros_usbpd_notify gets notifications of USB MUX
host event same as PD host events [1]. But currently on system that use
DT, the driver only listen on EC_HOST_EVENT_PD_MCU.

Add EC_HOST_EVENT_USB_MUX to the list of host events, so we have same
behavior on all platforms.
