ceph: don't clobber i_snap_caps on non-I_NEW inode

We want the snapdir to mirror the non-snapped directory's attributes for
most things, but i_snap_caps represents the caps granted on the snapshot
directory by the MDS itself. A misbehaving MDS could issue different
caps for the snapdir and we lose them here.

Only reset i_snap_caps when the inode is I_NEW. Also, move the setting
of i_op and i_fop inside the if block since they should never change
anyway.
