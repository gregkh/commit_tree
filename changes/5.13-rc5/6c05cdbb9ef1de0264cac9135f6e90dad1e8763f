usb: Restore the reference to ch9.h

Keep the textual reference to ch9.h as it was prior to commit
caa93d9bd2d7 ("usb: Fix up movement of USB core kerneldoc location").

As linux/usb/ch9.h does not contain comments anymore, explain
that drivers/usb/common/common.c includes such header and provides
declarations of a few utilities routines for manipulating the data types
from ch9.h. Also mention that drivers/usb/common/debug.c contains
some functions for creating debug output.
