xfs: move the check for post-EOF mappings into xfs_can_free_eofblocks

Fix the weird split of responsibilities between xfs_can_free_eofblocks
and xfs_free_eofblocks by moving the chunk of code that looks for any
actual post-EOF space mappings from the second function into the first.

This clears the way for deferred inode inactivation to be able to decide
if an inode needs inactivation work before committing the released inode
to the inactivation code paths (vs. marking it for reclaim).
