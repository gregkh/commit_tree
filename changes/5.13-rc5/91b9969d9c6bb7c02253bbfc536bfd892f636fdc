vfio/mdev: Simplify driver registration

This is only done once, we don't need to generate code to initialize a
structure stored in the ELF .data segment. Fill in the three required
.driver members directly instead of copying data into them during
mdev_register_driver().

Further the to_mdev_driver() function doesn't belong in a public header,
just inline it into the two places that need it. Finally, we can now
clearly see that 'drv' derived from dev->driver cannot be NULL, firstly
because the driver core forbids it, and secondly because NULL won't pass
through the container_of(). Remove the dead code.
