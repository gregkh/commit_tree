hwmon: (pmbus/isl68137) remove READ_TEMPERATURE_3 for RAA228228

The initial version of the RAA228228 datasheet claimed that the device
supported READ_TEMPERATURE_3 but not READ_TEMPERATURE_1. It has since been
discovered that the datasheet was incorrect. The RAA228228 does support
READ_TEMPERATURE_1 but does not support READ_TEMPERATURE_3.
