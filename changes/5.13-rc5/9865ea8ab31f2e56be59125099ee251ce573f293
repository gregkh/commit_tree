perf evlist: Add a method to return the list of evsels as a string

Add a 'scnprintf' method to obtain the list of evsels in a evlist as a
string, excluding the "dummy" event used for things like receiving
metadata events (PERF_RECORD_FORK, MMAP, etc) when synthesizing
preexisting threads.

Will be used to improve the error message for workload failure in 'perf
record.
