hugetlb: pass head page to remove_hugetlb_page()

When memory_failure() or soft_offline_page() is called on a tail page of
some hugetlb page, "BUG: unable to handle page fault" error can be
triggered.

remove_hugetlb_page() dereferences page->lru, so it's assumed that the
page points to a head page, but one of the caller,
dissolve_free_huge_page(), provides remove_hugetlb_page() with 'page'
which could be a tail page.  So pass 'head' to it, instead.
