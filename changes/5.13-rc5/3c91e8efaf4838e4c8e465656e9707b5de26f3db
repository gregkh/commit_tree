tools arch kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes from:

  70f094f4f01dc4d6 ("KVM: nVMX: Properly pad 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr'")

That don't entail changes in tooling.

This silences these tools/perf build warnings:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
