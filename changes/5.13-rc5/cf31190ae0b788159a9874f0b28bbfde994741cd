mlxsw: spectrum_matchall: Implement sampling using mirroring

Spectrum-2 and later ASICs support sampling of packets by mirroring to
the CPU with probability. There are several advantages compared to the
legacy dedicated sampling mechanism:

* Extra metadata per-packet: Egress port, egress traffic class, traffic
  class occupancy and end-to-end latency
* Ability to sample packets on egress / per-flow

Convert Spectrum-2 and later ASICs to perform sampling by mirroring to
the CPU with probability.

Subsequent patches will add support for egress / per-flow sampling and
expose the extra metadata.
