arm64: dts: exynos: re-order Slim SSS clocks to match dtschema

The dtschema expects pclk (APB clock) followed by aclk (AXI/AHB clock):

  arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos/exynos5433-tm2.dt.yaml:
    slim-sss@11140000: clock-names:0: 'pclk' was expected
  arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos/exynos5433-tm2.dt.yaml:
    slim-sss@11140000: clock-names:1: 'aclk' was expected
