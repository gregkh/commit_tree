vfio/mdev: Use struct mdev_type in struct mdev_device

The kobj pointer in mdev_device is actually pointing at a struct
mdev_type. Use the proper type so things are understandable.

There are a number of places that are confused and passing both the mdev
and the mtype as function arguments, fix these to derive the mtype
directly from the mdev to remove the redundancy.
