HID: usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl

In hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report length doesn't
take into account that report->size can be zero. When running the
syzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to
calculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to
the usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.

To fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero
report size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it
from hid_submit_ctrl().
