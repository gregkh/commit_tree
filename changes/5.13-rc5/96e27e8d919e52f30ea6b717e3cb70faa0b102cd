drm/radeon/si_dpm: Replace one-element array with flexible-array in struct SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in
struct SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE, instead of a one-element array, and use
the struct_size() helper to calculate the size for the allocation.

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warnings:
