kvm/x86: Fix 'lpages' kvm stat for TDM MMU

Large pages not being created properly may result in increased memory
access time. The 'lpages' kvm stat used to keep track of the current
number of large pages in the system, but with TDP MMU enabled the stat
is not showing the correct number.

This patch extends the lpages counter to cover the TDP case.
