MIPS: pci-mt7620: fix PLL lock check

Upstream a long-standing OpenWrt patch [0] that fixes MT7620 PCIe PLL
lock check. The existing code checks the wrong register bit: PPLL_SW_SET
is not defined in PPLL_CFG1 and bit 31 of PPLL_CFG1 is marked as reserved
in the MT7620 Programming Guide. The correct bit to check for PLL lock
is PPLL_LD (bit 23).

Also reword the error message for clarity.

Without this change it is unlikely that this driver ever worked with
mainline kernel.
