net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: reduce MDIO bus access latency

usleep_range often ends up sleeping much longer than the 10-20us provided
as a range here. This causes significant latency in mdio bus acceses,
which easily adds multiple seconds to the boot time on MT7621 when polling
DSA slave ports.
Use cond_resched instead of usleep_range, since the MDIO access does not
take much time
