xen/arm: introduce XENFEAT_direct_mapped and XENFEAT_not_direct_mapped

Newer Xen versions expose two Xen feature flags to tell us if the domain
is directly mapped or not. Only when a domain is directly mapped it
makes sense to enable swiotlb-xen on ARM.

Introduce a function on ARM to check the new Xen feature flags and also
to deal with the legacy case. Call the function xen_swiotlb_detect.
