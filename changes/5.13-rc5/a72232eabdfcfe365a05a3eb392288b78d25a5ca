cgroup: Add misc cgroup controller

The Miscellaneous cgroup provides the resource limiting and tracking
mechanism for the scalar resources which cannot be abstracted like the
other cgroup resources. Controller is enabled by the CONFIG_CGROUP_MISC
config option.

A resource can be added to the controller via enum misc_res_type{} in
the include/linux/misc_cgroup.h file and the corresponding name via
misc_res_name[] in the kernel/cgroup/misc.c file. Provider of the
resource must set its capacity prior to using the resource by calling
misc_cg_set_capacity().

Once a capacity is set then the resource usage can be updated using
charge and uncharge APIs. All of the APIs to interact with misc
controller are in include/linux/misc_cgroup.h.

Miscellaneous controller provides 3 interface files. If two misc
resources (res_a and res_b) are registered then:

misc.capacity
A read-only flat-keyed file shown only in the root cgroup.  It shows
miscellaneous scalar resources available on the platform along with
their quantities::

    $ cat misc.capacity
    res_a 50
    res_b 10

misc.current
A read-only flat-keyed file shown in the non-root cgroups.  It shows
the current usage of the resources in the cgroup and its children::

    $ cat misc.current
    res_a 3
    res_b 0

misc.max
A read-write flat-keyed file shown in the non root cgroups. Allowed
maximum usage of the resources in the cgroup and its children.::

    $ cat misc.max
    res_a max
    res_b 4

Limit can be set by::

    # echo res_a 1 > misc.max

Limit can be set to max by::

    # echo res_a max > misc.max

Limits can be set more than the capacity value in the misc.capacity
file.
