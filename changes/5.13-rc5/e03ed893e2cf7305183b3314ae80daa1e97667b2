iio: accel: sca3000: use devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup() helper

This change makes use of the devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup() helper, however
the unwind order is changed.
The life-time of the kfifo object is attached to the parent device object.
This is to make the driver a bit more consistent with the other IIO
drivers, even though (as it is now before this change) it shouldn't be a
problem.
