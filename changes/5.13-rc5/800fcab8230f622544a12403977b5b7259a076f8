net: phy: Add support for microchip SMI0 MDIO bus

SMI0 is a mangled version of MDIO. The main low level difference is
the MDIO C22 OP code is always 0, not 0x2 or 0x1 for Read/Write. The
read/write information is instead encoded in the PHY address.

Extend the bit-bang code to allow the op code to be overridden, but
default to normal C22 values. Add an extra compatible to the mdio-gpio
driver, and when this compatible is present, set the op codes to 0.

A higher level driver, sitting on top of the basic MDIO bus driver can
then implement the rest of the microchip SMI0 odderties.
