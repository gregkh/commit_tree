ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable mute/micmute LEDs and limit mic boost on EliteBook 845 G8

On HP EliteBook 845 G8, the audio LEDs can be enabled by
ALC285_FIXUP_HP_MUTE_LED. So use it accordingly.

In addition to that, the mic captures lots of noises, so also limits the
mic boost. The quality of capture audio becomes crystal clear after
limiting the mic boost.
