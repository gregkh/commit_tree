ice: report supported and advertised autoneg using PHY capabilities

Ethtool incorrectly reported supported and advertised auto-negotiation
settings for a backplane PHY image which did not support auto-negotiation.
This can occur when using media or PHY type for reporting ethtool
supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings.

Remove setting supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings based
on PHY type in ice_phy_type_to_ethtool(), and MAC type in
ice_get_link_ksettings().

Ethtool supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings should be
based on the PHY image using the AQ command get PHY capabilities with
media. Add setting supported and advertised auto-negotiation settings
based get PHY capabilities with media in ice_get_link_ksettings().
