HID: hid-input: add mapping for emoji picker key

HUTRR101 added a new usage code for a key that is supposed to invoke and
dismiss an emoji picker widget to assist users to locate and enter emojis.

This patch adds a new key definition KEY_EMOJI_PICKER and maps 0x0c/0x0d9
usage code to this new keycode. Additionally hid-debug is adjusted to
recognize this new usage code as well.
