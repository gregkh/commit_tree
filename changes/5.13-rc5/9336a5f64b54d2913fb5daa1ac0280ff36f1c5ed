kexec: Move ELF fields to struct kimage

ELF related fields elf_headers, elf_headers_sz, and elf_load_addr are
defined in architecture specific 'struct kimage_arch' for x86, powerpc,
and arm64.  The name of these fields are different in these
architectures that makes it hard to have a common code for setting up
the device tree for kexec system call.

Move the ELF fields to 'struct kimage' defined in include/linux/kexec.h
so common code can use it.
