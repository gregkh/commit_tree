HID: quirks: Set INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE for Saitek X65

The Saitek X65 joystick has a pair of axes that were used as mouse
pointer controls by the Windows driver. The corresponding usage page is
the Game Controls page, which is not recognized by the generic HID
driver, and therefore, both axes get mapped to ABS_MISC. The quirk makes
the second axis get mapped to ABS_MISC+1, and therefore made available
separately.
