erofs: fix 1 lcluster-sized pcluster for big pcluster

If the 1st NONHEAD lcluster of a pcluster isn't CBLKCNT lcluster type
rather than a HEAD or PLAIN type instead, which means its pclustersize
_must_ be 1 lcluster (since its uncompressed size < 2 lclusters),
as illustrated below:

       HEAD     HEAD / PLAIN    lcluster type
   ____________ ____________
  |_:__________|_________:__|   file data (uncompressed)
   .                .
  .____________.
  |____________|                pcluster data (compressed)

Such on-disk case was explained before [1] but missed to be handled
properly in the runtime implementation.

It can be observed if manually generating 1 lcluster-sized pcluster
with 2 lclusters (thus CBLKCNT doesn't exist.) Let's fix it now.
