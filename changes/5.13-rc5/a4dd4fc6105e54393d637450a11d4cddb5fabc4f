net: appletalk: cops: Fix data race in cops_probe1

In cops_probe1(), there is a write to dev->base_addr after requesting an
interrupt line and registering the interrupt handler cops_interrupt().
The handler might be called in parallel to handle an interrupt.
cops_interrupt() tries to read dev->base_addr leading to a potential
data race. So write to dev->base_addr before calling request_irq().
