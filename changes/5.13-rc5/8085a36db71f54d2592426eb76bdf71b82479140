i40e: Remove LLDP frame filters

Remove filters from being setup in case of software DCB and allow the
LLDP frames to be properly transmitted to the wire.

It is not possible to transmit the LLDP frame out of the port, if they
are filtered by control VSI. This prohibits software LLDP agent
properly communicate its DCB capabilities to the neighbors.
