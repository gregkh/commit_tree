scsi: qla2xxx: Fix use after free in bsg

On bsg command completion, bsg_job_done() was called while qla driver
continued to access the bsg_job buffer. bsg_job_done() would free up
resources that ended up being reused by other task while the driver
continued to access the buffers. As a result, driver was reading garbage
data.
