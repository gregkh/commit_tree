ring-buffer: Allow ring_buffer_event_time_stamp() to return time stamp of all events

Currently, ring_buffer_event_time_stamp() only returns an accurate time
stamp of the event if it has an absolute extended time stamp attached to
it. To make it more robust, use the event_stamp() in case the event does
not have an absolute value attached to it.

This will allow ring_buffer_event_time_stamp() to be used in more cases
than just histograms, and it will also allow histograms to not require
including absolute values all the time.
