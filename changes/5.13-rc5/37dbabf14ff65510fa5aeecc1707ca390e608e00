ASoC: arizona: Make the wm5102, wm5110, wm8997 and wm8998 drivers use the new jack library

Make all arizona codec drivers for which drivers/mfd/arizona-core.c used
to instantiate a "arizona-extcon" child-device use the new arizona-jack.c
library for jack-detection.

This has been tested on a Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 1051L with a WM5102 codec.
