drivers: base: Fix device link removal

When device_link_free() drops references to the supplier and
consumer devices of the device link going away and the reference
being dropped turns out to be the last one for any of those
device objects, its ->release callback will be invoked and it
may sleep which goes against the SRCU callback execution
requirements.

To address this issue, make the device link removal code carry out
the device_link_free() actions preceded by SRCU synchronization from
a separate work item (the "long" workqueue is used for that, because
it does not matter when the device link memory is released and it may
take time to get to that point) instead of using SRCU callbacks.

While at it, make the code work analogously when SRCU is not enabled
to reduce the differences between the SRCU and non-SRCU cases.
