platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Show LPM residency in microseconds

Modify the low power mode (LPM or sub-state) residency counters to display
in microseconds just like the slp_s0_residency counter. The granularity of
the counter is approximately 30.5us per tick. Double this value then divide
by two to maintain accuracy.
