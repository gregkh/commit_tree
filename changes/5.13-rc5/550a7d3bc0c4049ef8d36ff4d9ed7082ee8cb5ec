fuse: add a flag FUSE_SETXATTR_ACL_KILL_SGID to kill SGID

When posix access ACL is set, it can have an effect on file mode and it can
also need to clear SGID if.

- None of caller's group/supplementary groups match file owner group.
AND
- Caller is not priviliged (No CAP_FSETID).

As of now fuser server is responsible for changing the file mode as
well. But it does not know whether to clear SGID or not.

So add a flag FUSE_SETXATTR_ACL_KILL_SGID and send this info with SETXATTR
to let file server know that sgid needs to be cleared as well.
