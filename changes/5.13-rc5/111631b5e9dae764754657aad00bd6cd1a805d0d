powerpc/align: Don't use __get_user_instr() on kernel addresses

In the old days, when we didn't have kernel userspace access
protection and had set_fs(), it was wise to use __get_user()
and friends to read kernel memory.

Nowadays, get_user() is granting userspace access and is exclusively
for userspace access.

In alignment exception handler, use probe_kernel_read_inst()
instead of __get_user_instr() for reading instructions in kernel.

This will allow to remove the is_kernel_addr() check in
__get/put_user() in a following patch.
