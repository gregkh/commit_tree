drm/amdgpu: Add reset control to amdgpu_device

v1: Add generic amdgpu_reset_control to handle different types of resets. It
may be added at device, hive or ip level. Each reset control has a list
of handlers associated with it to handle different types of reset. Reset
control is responsible for choosing the right handler given a particular
reset context.

Handler objects may implement a set of functions on how to handle a
particular type of reset.

prepare_env = Prepare environment/software context (not used currently).
prepare_hwcontext = Prepare hardware context for the reset.
perform_reset = Perform the type of reset.
restore_hwcontext = Restore the hw context after reset.
restore_env = Restore the environment after reset (not used currently).

Reset context carries the context of reset, as of now this is based on
the parameters used for current set of resets.

v2: Fix coding style
