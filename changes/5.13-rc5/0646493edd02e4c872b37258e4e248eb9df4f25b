mtd: rawnand: qcom: Update register macro name for 0x2c offset

This change will remove unused register name macro NAND_DEV1_ECC_CFG.
Since this register was only available in QPIC version 1.4.20 ipq40xx
and it was not used. In QPIC version 1.5 on wards this register got
removed.In QPIC version 2.0 0x2c offset is updated with register
NAND_AUTO_STATUS_EN So adding this register macro NAND_AUTO_STATUS_EN
with offset 0x2c.
