btrfs: fixup error handling in fixup_inode_link_counts

This function has the following pattern

	while (1) {
		ret = whatever();
		if (ret)
			goto out;
	}
	ret = 0
out:
	return ret;

However several places in this while loop we simply break; when there's
a problem, thus clearing the return value, and in one case we do a
return -EIO, and leak the memory for the path.

Fix this by re-arranging the loop to deal with ret == 1 coming from
btrfs_search_slot, and then simply delete the

	ret = 0;
out:

bit so everybody can break if there is an error, which will allow for
proper error handling to occur.
