iio: buffer: use sysfs_attr_init() on allocated attrs

When dynamically allocating sysfs attributes, it's a good idea to call
sysfs_attr_init() on them to initialize lock_class_keys.
This change does that.

The lock_class_keys are set when the CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC symbol is
enabled. Which is [likely] one reason why I did not see this during
development.

I also am not able to see this even with CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC enabled,
so this may [likely] be reproduce-able on some system configurations.
