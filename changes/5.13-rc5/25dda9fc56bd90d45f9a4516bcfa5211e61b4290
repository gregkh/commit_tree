usb: dwc3: gadget: Properly track pending and queued SG

The driver incorrectly uses req->num_pending_sgs to track both the
number of pending and queued SG entries. It only prepares the next
request if the previous is done, and it doesn't update num_pending_sgs
until there is TRB completion interrupt. This may starve the controller
of more TRBs until the num_pending_sgs is decremented.

Fix this by decrementing the num_pending_sgs after they are queued and
properly track both num_mapped_sgs and num_queued_sgs.
