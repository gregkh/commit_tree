clk: Mark fwnodes when their clock provider is added

This is a follow-up for:
commit 3c9ea42802a1 ("clk: Mark fwnodes when their clock provider is added/removed")

The above commit updated the deprecated of_clk_add_provider(),
but missed to update the preferred of_clk_add_hw_provider().
Update it now.
