arm64: mte: Report async tag faults before suspend

When MTE async mode is enabled TFSR_EL1 contains the accumulative
asynchronous tag check faults for EL1 and EL0.

During the suspend/resume operations the firmware might perform some
operations that could change the state of the register resulting in
a spurious tag check fault report.

Report asynchronous tag faults before suspend and clear the TFSR_EL1
register after resume to prevent this to happen.
