bus: ti-sysc: Fix missing quirk flags for sata

Naresh Kamboju <naresh.kamboju@linaro.org> reported that Beaglebone-X15
does not detect sata drives any longer after dra7 was flipped to boot with
device tree data only. Turns out we are now missing the sata related quirk
flags in ti-sysc that we used to have earlier.

Fixes: 98feab31ac49 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for dra7 sata")
Fixes: 21206c8f2cb5 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for omap5 sata")
