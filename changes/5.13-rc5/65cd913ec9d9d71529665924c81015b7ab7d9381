ovl: invalidate readdir cache on changes to dir with origin

The test in ovl_dentry_version_inc() was out-dated and did not include
the case where readdir cache is used on a non-merge dir that has origin
xattr, indicating that it may contain leftover whiteouts.

To make the code more robust, use the same helper ovl_dir_is_real()
to determine if readdir cache should be used and if readdir cache should
be invalidated.
