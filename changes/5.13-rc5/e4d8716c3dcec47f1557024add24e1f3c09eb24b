i2c: i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus reset

Now that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bit
in a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers an
interrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is not
prepared for this situation and will try to process the interrupt as
if it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the case
of a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory
access.

This condition was reproduced several times by syzbot:

So disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts will
be enabled again for the following transaction.
