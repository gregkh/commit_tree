net: dsa: tag_8021q: fix the VLAN IDs used for encoding sub-VLANs

When using sub-VLANs in the range of 1-7, the resulting value from:

	rx_vid = dsa_8021q_rx_vid_subvlan(ds, port, subvlan);

is wrong according to the description from tag_8021q.c:

 | 11  | 10  |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
 +-----------+-----+-----------------+-----------+-----------------------+
 |    DIR    | SVL |    SWITCH_ID    |  SUBVLAN  |          PORT         |
 +-----------+-----+-----------------+-----------+-----------------------+

For example, when ds->index == 0, port == 3 and subvlan == 1,
dsa_8021q_rx_vid_subvlan() returns 1027, same as it returns for
subvlan == 0, but it should have returned 1043.

This is because the low portion of the subvlan bits are not masked
properly when writing into the 12-bit VLAN value. They are masked into
bits 4:3, but they should be masked into bits 5:4.
