Input: gpio-keys - fix crash when disabliing GPIO-less buttons

My brain-damaged adjustments to Paul's patch caused crashes in
gpio_keys_disable_button() when driver is used in GPIO-less (i.e.
purely interrupt-driven) setups, because I mixed together debounce and
release timers when they are in fact separate:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000c

Let's fix it up.
