KVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs

Use the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encrypting
VMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead of
created_vcpus.  This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference as
created_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated at
the very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow the
bulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctly
restricting the max number of max vCPUs.
