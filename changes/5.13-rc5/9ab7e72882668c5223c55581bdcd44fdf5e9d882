net: ipa: add some missing resource limits

Currently, the SDM845 configuration data defines resource limits for
the first two resource groups (for both source and destination
resource types).  The hardware supports additional resource groups,
and we should program the resource limits for those groups as well.

Even the "unused" destination resource group (number 2) should have
non-zero limits programmed in some cases, to ensure correct operation.

Add these missing resource group limit definitions to the SDM845
configuration data.
