nvme-loop: reset queue count to 1 in nvme_loop_destroy_io_queues()

The queue count is increased in nvme_loop_init_io_queues(), so we
need to reset it to 1 at the end of nvme_loop_destroy_io_queues().
Otherwise the function is not re-entrant safe, and crash will happen
during concurrent reset and remove calls.
