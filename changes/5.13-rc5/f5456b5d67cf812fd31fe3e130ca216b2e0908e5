gfs2: Clean up revokes on normal withdraws

Before this patch, the system ail lists were cleaned up if the logd
process withdrew, but on other withdraws, they were not cleaned up.
This included the cleaning up of the revokes as well.

This patch reorganizes things a bit so that all withdraws (not just logd)
clean up the ail lists, including any pending revokes.
