PCI/MSI: Make pci_host_common_probe() declare its reliance on MSI domains

The generic PCI host driver relies on MSI domains for MSIs to
be provided to its end-points. Make this dependency explicit.

This cures the warnings occuring on arm/arm64 VMs when booted
with PCI virtio devices and no MSI controller (no GICv3 ITS,
for example).

It is likely that other drivers will need to express the same
dependency.
