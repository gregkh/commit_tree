dm snapshot: properly fix a crash when an origin has no snapshots

If an origin target has no snapshots, o->split_boundary is set to 0.
This causes BUG_ON(sectors <= 0) in block/bio.c:bio_split().

Fix this by initializing chunk_size, and in turn split_boundary, to
rounddown_pow_of_two(UINT_MAX) -- the largest power of two that fits
into "unsigned" type.
