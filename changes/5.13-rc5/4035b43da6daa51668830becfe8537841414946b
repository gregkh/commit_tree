xen-swiotlb: remove xen_set_nslabs

The xen_set_nslabs function is a little weird, as it has just one
caller, that caller passes a global variable as the argument,
which is then overriden in the function and a derivative of it
returned.  Just add a cpp symbol for the default size using a readable
constant and open code the remaining three lines in the caller.
