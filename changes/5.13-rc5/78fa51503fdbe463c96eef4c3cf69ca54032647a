mm: use proper type for cma_[alloc|release]

size_t in cma_alloc is confusing since it makes people think it's byte
count, not pages.  Change it to unsigned long[1].

The unsigned int in cma_release is also not right so change it.  Since we
have unsigned long in cma_release, free_contig_range should also respect
it.
