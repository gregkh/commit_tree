usb: typec: tcpm: Fix wrong handling in GET_SINK_CAP

After receiving Sink Capabilities Message in GET_SINK_CAP AMS, it is
incorrect to call tcpm_pd_handle_state because the Message is expected
and the current state is not Ready states. The result of this incorrect
operation ends in Soft Reset which is definitely wrong. Simply
forwarding to Ready States is enough to finish the AMS.
