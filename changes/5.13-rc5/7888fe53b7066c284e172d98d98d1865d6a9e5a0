ethtool: Add common function for filling out strings

Add a function to handle the common pattern of printing a string into the
ethtool strings interface and incrementing the string pointer by the
ETH_GSTRING_LEN. Most of the drivers end up doing this and several have
implemented their own versions of this function so it would make sense to
consolidate on one implementation.
