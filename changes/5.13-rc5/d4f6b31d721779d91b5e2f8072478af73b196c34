ceph: don't allow access to MDS-private inodes

The MDS reserves a set of inodes for its own usage, and these should
never be accessible to clients. Add a new helper to vet a proposed
inode number against that range, and complain loudly and refuse to
create or look it up if it's in it.

Also, ensure that the MDS doesn't try to delegate inodes that are in
that range or lower. Print a warning if it does, and don't save the
range in the xarray.
