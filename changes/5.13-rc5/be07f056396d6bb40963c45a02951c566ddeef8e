tipc: simplify the finalize work queue

This patch is to use "struct work_struct" for the finalize work queue
instead of "struct tipc_net_work", as it can get the "net" and "addr"
from tipc_net's other members and there is no need to add extra net
and addr in tipc_net by defining "struct tipc_net_work".

Note that it's safe to get net from tn->bcl as bcl is always released
after the finalize work queue is done.
