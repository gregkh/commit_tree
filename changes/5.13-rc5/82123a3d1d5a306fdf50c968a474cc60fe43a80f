powerpc/kprobes: Fix validation of prefixed instructions across page boundary

When checking if the probed instruction is the suffix of a prefixed
instruction, we access the instruction at the previous word. If the
probed instruction is the very first word of a module, we can end up
trying to access an invalid page.

Fix this by skipping the check for all instructions at the beginning of
a page. Prefixed instructions cannot cross a 64-byte boundary and as
such, we don't expect to encounter a suffix as the very first word in a
page for kernel text. Even if there are prefixed instructions crossing
a page boundary (from a module, for instance), the instruction will be
illegal, so preventing probing on the suffix of such prefix instructions
isn't worthwhile.
