HID: multitouch: Disable event reporting on suspend on the Asus T101HA touchpad

The Asus T101HA has a problem with spurious wakeups when the lid is
closed, this is caused by the screen sitting so close to the touchpad
that the touchpad ends up reporting touch events, causing these wakeups.

Add a quirk which disables event reporting on suspend when set, and
enable this quirk for the Asus T101HA touchpad fixing the spurious
wakeups, while still allowing the device to be woken by pressing a
key on the keyboard (which is part of the same USB device).
