ACPI: irq: Prevent unregistering of GIC SGIs

When using ACPI on arm64, which implies the GIC IRQ model, no
table should ever provide a GSI number in the range [0:15],
as these are reserved for IPIs.

However, drivers tend to call acpi_unregister_gsi() with any
random GSI number provided by half baked tables, which results
in an exploding kernel when its IPIs have been unconfigured.

In order to catch this, check for the silly case early, warn
that something is going wrong and avoid the above disaster.
