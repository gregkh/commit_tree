mfd: Add MFD driver for ATC260x PMICs

Add initial support for the Actions Semi ATC260x PMICs which integrates
Audio Codec, Power management, Clock generation and GPIO controller
blocks.

For the moment this driver only supports Regulator, Poweroff and Onkey
functionalities for the ATC2603C and ATC2609A chip variants.

Since the PMICs can be accessed using both I2C and SPI buses, the
following driver structure has been adopted:

           -----> atc260x-core.c (Implements core functionalities)
          /
ATC260x --------> atc260x-i2c.c (Implements I2C interface)
          \
           -----> atc260x-spi.c (Implements SPI interface - TODO)
