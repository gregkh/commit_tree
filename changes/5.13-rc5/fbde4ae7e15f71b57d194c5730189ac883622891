drm/xen: adjust Kconfig

By having selected DRM_XEN, I was assuming I would build the frontend
driver. As it turns out this is a dummy option, and I have really not
been building this (because I had DRM disabled). Make it a promptless
one, moving the "depends on" to the other, real option, and "select"ing
the dummy one.
