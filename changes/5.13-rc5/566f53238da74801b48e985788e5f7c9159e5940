Revert "char: hpet: fix a missing check of ioremap"

This reverts commit 13bd14a41ce3105d5b1f3cd8b4d1e249d17b6d9b.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

While this is technically correct, it is only fixing ONE of these errors
in this function, so the patch is not fully correct.  I'll leave this
revert and provide a fix for this later that resolves this same
"problem" everywhere in this function.
