KVM: nVMX: Truncate bits 63:32 of VMCS field on nested check in !64-bit

Drop bits 63:32 of the VMCS field encoding when checking for a nested
VM-Exit on VMREAD/VMWRITE in !64-bit mode.  VMREAD and VMWRITE always
use 32-bit operands outside of 64-bit mode.

The actual emulation of VMREAD/VMWRITE does the right thing, this bug is
purely limited to incorrectly causing a nested VM-Exit if a GPR happens
to have bits 63:32 set outside of 64-bit mode.

Fixes: a7cde481b6e8 ("KVM: nVMX: Do not forward VMREAD/VMWRITE VMExits to L1 if required so by vmcs12 vmread/vmwrite bitmaps")
