tty: actually undefine superseded ASYNC flags

Some kernel-internal ASYNC flags have been superseded by tty-port flags
and should no longer be used by kernel drivers.

Fix the misspelled "__KERNEL__" compile guards which failed their sole
purpose to break out-of-tree drivers that have not yet been updated.
