usb: xhci-mtk: add only one extra CS for FS/LS INTR

In USB2 Spec:
"11.18.5 TT Response Generation
In general, there will be two (or more) complete-split
transactions scheduled for a periodic endpoint.
However, for interrupt endpoints, the maximum size of
the full-/low-speed transaction guarantees that it can
never require more than two complete-split transactions.
Two complete-split transactions are only required
when the transaction spans a microframe boundary."

Due to the maxp is 64, and less then 188 (at most in one
microframe), seems never span boundary, so use only one CS
for FS/LS interrupt transfer, this will save some bandwidth.
