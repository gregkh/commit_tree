vdpa_sim: cleanup kiovs in vdpasim_free()

vringh_getdesc_iotlb() allocates memory to store the kvec, that
is freed with vringh_kiov_cleanup().

vringh_getdesc_iotlb() is able to reuse a kvec previously allocated,
so in order to avoid to allocate the kvec for each request, we are
not calling vringh_kiov_cleanup() when we finished to handle a
request, but we should call it when we free the entire device.
