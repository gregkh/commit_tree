power: supply: sbs-battery: use dev_err_probe

Introduce usage of dev_err_probe in probe routine, which
makes the code slightly more readable and removes some
lines of code. It also removes PROBE_DEFER errors being
logged by default, which are common when the battery is
waiting for the charger driver to be registered.

This also cleans up a useless goto and instead returns
directly.
