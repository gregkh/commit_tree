drm/amdgpu: enable one vf mode on sienna cichlid vf

sienna cichlid needs one vf mode which allows vf to set and get
clock status from guest vm. So now expose the required interface
and allow some smu request on VF mode. Also since this asic blocked
direct MMIO access, use KIQ to send SMU request under sriov vf.

OD use same command as getting pp table which is not allowed for
 sienna cichlid, so remove OD feature under sriov vf.
