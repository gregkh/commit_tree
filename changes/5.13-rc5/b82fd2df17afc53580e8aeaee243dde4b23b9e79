pinctrl: renesas: Make sh_pfc_pin_to_bias_reg() static

Now all R-Car pin control drivers have been converted to the common
R-Car bias handling, sh_pfc_pin_to_bias_reg() is only called from a
single place.  Move it from core.c to pinctrl.c, make it static, and
rename it to rcar_pin_to_bias_reg(), as it is specific to R-Car SoCs.
