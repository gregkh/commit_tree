KVM: arm64: Resolve all pending PC updates before immediate exit

Commit 26778aaa134a ("KVM: arm64: Commit pending PC adjustemnts before
returning to userspace") fixed the PC updating issue by forcing an explicit
synchronisation of the exception state on vcpu exit to userspace.

However, we forgot to take into account the case where immediate_exit is
set by userspace and KVM_RUN will exit immediately. Fix it by resolving all
pending PC updates before returning to userspace.

Since __kvm_adjust_pc() relies on a loaded vcpu context, I moved the
immediate_exit checking right after vcpu_load(). We will get some overhead
if immediate_exit is true (which should hopefully be rare).
