fanotify: fix permission model of unprivileged group

Reporting event->pid should depend on the privileges of the user that
initialized the group, not the privileges of the user reading the
events.

Use an internal group flag FANOTIFY_UNPRIV to record the fact that the
group was initialized by an unprivileged user.

To be on the safe side, the premissions to setup filesystem and mount
marks now require that both the user that initialized the group and
the user setting up the mark have CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
