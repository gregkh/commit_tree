platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add info for the Chuwi Hi10 Pro (CWI529) tablet

Add touchscreen info for the Chuwi Hi10 Pro (CWI529) tablet. This includes
info for getting the firmware directly from the UEFI, so that the user does
not need to manually install the firmware in /lib/firmware/silead.

This change will make the touchscreen on these devices work OOTB,
without requiring any manual setup.
