selftests: mptcp: timeout testcases for multi addresses

This patch added the timeout testcases for multi addresses, valid and
invalid.

These testcases need to transmit 8 ADD_ADDRs, so add a new speed level
'least' to set 10 to mptcp_connect to slow down the transmitting process.
The original speed level 'slow' still uses 50.
