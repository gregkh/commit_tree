ixgbe: add correct exception tracing for XDP

Add missing exception tracing to XDP when a number of different
errors can occur. The support was only partial. Several errors
where not logged which would confuse the user quite a lot not
knowing where and why the packets disappeared.

Fixes: 33fdc82f0883 ("ixgbe: add support for XDP_TX action")
Fixes: d0bcacd0a130 ("ixgbe: add AF_XDP zero-copy Rx support")
