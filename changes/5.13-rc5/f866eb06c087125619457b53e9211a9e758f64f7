scsi: lpfc: Fix reference counting errors in lpfc_cmpl_els_rsp()

Call traces are being seen that result from a nodelist structure ref
counting error. They are typically seen after transmission of an LS_RJT ELS
response.

Aged code in lpfc_cmpl_els_rsp() calls lpfc_nlp_not_used() which, if the
ndlp reference count is exactly 1, will decrement the reference count.
Previously lpfc_nlp_put() was within lpfc_els_free_iocb(), and the 'put'
within the free would only be invoked if cmdiocb->context1 was not NULL.
Since the nodelist structure reference count is decremented when exiting
lpfc_cmpl_els_rsp() the lpfc_nlp_not_used() calls are no longer required.
Calling them is causing the reference count issue.

Fix by removing the lpfc_nlp_not_used() calls.
