leds: lp5523: check return value of lp5xx_read and jump to cleanup code

Check return value of lp5xx_read and if non-zero, jump to code at end of
the function, causing lp5523_stop_all_engines to be executed before
returning the error value up the call chain. This fixes the original
commit (248b57015f35) which was reverted due to the University of Minnesota
problems.
