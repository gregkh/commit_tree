KVM: SVM: Delay restoration of host MSR_TSC_AUX until return to userspace

Use KVM's "user return MSRs" framework to defer restoring the host's
MSR_TSC_AUX until the CPU returns to userspace.  Add/improve comments to
clarify why MSR_TSC_AUX is intercepted on both RDMSR and WRMSR, and why
it's safe for KVM to keep the guest's value loaded even if KVM is
scheduled out.
