ACPI: scan: Drop sta argument from acpi_add_single_object()

Move the initial status check for ACPI_BUS_TYPE_PROCESSOR objects
into acpi_add_single_object() so it is not necessary to pass the
"sta" argument to it, get rid of that argument from there and update
the callers of that function accordingly.

No intentional functional impact.
