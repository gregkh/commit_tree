usb: typec: tcpci_maxim: Make symbol 'max_tcpci_tcpci_write_table' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/usb/typec/tcpm/tcpci_maxim.c:55:34: warning:
 symbol 'max_tcpci_tcpci_write_table' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of tcpci_maxim.c, so this
commit marks it static.
