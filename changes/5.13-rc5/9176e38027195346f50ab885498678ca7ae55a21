net: davicom: Remove redundant assignment to ret

Variable ret is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/net/ethernet/davicom/dm9000.c:1527:5: warning: Value stored to
'ret' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
