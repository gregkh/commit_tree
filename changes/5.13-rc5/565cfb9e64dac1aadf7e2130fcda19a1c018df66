rcu/tree: Add a trace event for RCU CPU stall warnings

This commit adds a trace event which allows tracing the beginnings of RCU
CPU stall warnings on systems where sysctl_panic_on_rcu_stall is disabled.

The first parameter is the name of RCU flavor like other trace events.
The second parameter indicates whether this is a stall of an expedited
grace period, a self-detected stall of a normal grace period, or a stall
of a normal grace period detected by some CPU other than the one that
is stalled.

RCU CPU stall warnings are often caused by external-to-RCU issues,
for example, in interrupt handling or task scheduling.  Therefore,
this event uses TRACE_EVENT, not TRACE_EVENT_RCU, to avoid requiring
those interested in tracing RCU CPU stalls to rebuild their kernels
with CONFIG_RCU_TRACE=y.
