signal: Implement SIL_FAULT_TRAPNO

Now that si_trapno is part of the union in _si_fault and available on
all architectures, add SIL_FAULT_TRAPNO and update siginfo_layout to
return SIL_FAULT_TRAPNO when the code assumes si_trapno is valid.

There is room for future changes to reduce when si_trapno is valid but
this is all that is needed to make si_trapno and the other members of
the the union in _sigfault mutually exclusive.

Update the code that uses siginfo_layout to deal with SIL_FAULT_TRAPNO
and have the same code ignore si_trapno in in all other cases.
