tty: remove TTY_LDISC_MAGIC

First, it is never checked. Second, use of it as a debugging aid is
at least questionable. With the current tools, I don't think anyone used
this kind of thing for debugging purposes for years.

On the top of that, e.g. serdev does not set this field of tty_ldisc_ops
at all.

So get rid of this legacy.
