usb: dwc3: Resolve kernel-doc warning for Xilinx DWC3 driver

The kernel-doc run gave a warning for Xilinx DWC3 driver:

drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-xilinx.c:27: warning: expecting prototype for
dwc3(). Prototype was for XLNX_USB_PHY_RST_EN() instead

Basically it was due to an extra '*' in line:2. This patch fixes the same.
