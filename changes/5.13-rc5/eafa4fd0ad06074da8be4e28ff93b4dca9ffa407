btrfs: fix exhaustion of the system chunk array due to concurrent allocations

When we are running out of space for updating the chunk tree, that is,
when we are low on available space in the system space info, if we have
many task concurrently allocating block groups, via fallocate for example,
many of them can end up all allocating new system chunks when only one is
needed. In extreme cases this can lead to exhaustion of the system chunk
array, which has a size limit of 2048 bytes, and results in a transaction
abort with errno EFBIG, producing a trace in dmesg like the following,
which was triggered on a PowerPC machine with a node/leaf size of 64K:

The following steps explain how we can end up in this situation:

1) Task A is at check_system_chunk(), either because it is allocating a
   new data or metadata block group, at btrfs_chunk_alloc(), or because
   it is removing a block group or turning a block group RO. It does not
   matter why;

2) Task A sees that there is not enough free space in the system
   space_info object, that is 'left' is < 'thresh'. And at this point
   the system space_info has a value of 0 for its 'bytes_may_use'
   counter;

3) As a consequence task A calls btrfs_alloc_chunk() in order to allocate
   a new system block group (chunk) and then reserves 'thresh' bytes in
   the chunk block reserve with the call to btrfs_block_rsv_add(). This
   changes the chunk block reserve's 'reserved' and 'size' counters by an
   amount of 'thresh', and changes the 'bytes_may_use' counter of the
   system space_info object from 0 to 'thresh'.

   Also during its call to btrfs_alloc_chunk(), we end up increasing the
   value of the 'total_bytes' counter of the system space_info object by
   8MiB (the size of a system chunk stripe). This happens through the
   call chain:

   btrfs_alloc_chunk()
       create_chunk()
           btrfs_make_block_group()
               btrfs_update_space_info()

4) After it finishes the first phase of the block group allocation, at
   btrfs_chunk_alloc(), task A unlocks the chunk mutex;

5) At this point the new system block group was added to the transaction
   handle's list of new block groups, but its block group item, device
   items and chunk item were not yet inserted in the extent, device and
   chunk trees, respectively. That only happens later when we call
   btrfs_finish_chunk_alloc() through a call to
   btrfs_create_pending_block_groups();

   Note that only when we update the chunk tree, through the call to
   btrfs_finish_chunk_alloc(), we decrement the 'reserved' counter
   of the chunk block reserve as we COW/allocate extent buffers,
   through:

   btrfs_alloc_tree_block()
      btrfs_use_block_rsv()
         btrfs_block_rsv_use_bytes()

   And the system space_info's 'bytes_may_use' is decremented everytime
   we allocate an extent buffer for COW operations on the chunk tree,
   through:

   btrfs_alloc_tree_block()
      btrfs_reserve_extent()
         find_free_extent()
            btrfs_add_reserved_bytes()

   If we end up COWing less chunk btree nodes/leaves than expected, which
   is the typical case since the amount of space we reserve is always
   pessimistic to account for the worst possible case, we release the
   unused space through:

   btrfs_create_pending_block_groups()
      btrfs_trans_release_chunk_metadata()
         btrfs_block_rsv_release()
            block_rsv_release_bytes()
                btrfs_space_info_free_bytes_may_use()

   But before task A gets into btrfs_create_pending_block_groups()...

6) Many other tasks start allocating new block groups through fallocate,
   each one does the first phase of block group allocation in a
   serialized way, since btrfs_chunk_alloc() takes the chunk mutex
   before calling check_system_chunk() and btrfs_alloc_chunk().

   However before everyone enters the final phase of the block group
   allocation, that is, before calling btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(),
   new tasks keep coming to allocate new block groups and while at
   check_system_chunk(), the system space_info's 'bytes_may_use' keeps
   increasing each time a task reserves space in the chunk block reserve.
   This means that eventually some other task can end up not seeing enough
   free space in the system space_info and decide to allocate yet another
   system chunk.

   This may repeat several times if yet more new tasks keep allocating
   new block groups before task A, and all the other tasks, finish the
   creation of the pending block groups, which is when reserved space
   in excess is released. Eventually this can result in exhaustion of
   system chunk array in the superblock, with btrfs_add_system_chunk()
   returning EFBIG, resulting later in a transaction abort.

   Even when we don't reach the extreme case of exhausting the system
   array, most, if not all, unnecessarily created system block groups
   end up being unused since when finishing creation of the first
   pending system block group, the creation of the following ones end
   up not needing to COW nodes/leaves of the chunk tree, so we never
   allocate and deallocate from them, resulting in them never being
   added to the list of unused block groups - as a consequence they
   don't get deleted by the cleaner kthread - the only exceptions are
   if we unmount and mount the filesystem again, which adds any unused
   block groups to the list of unused block groups, if a scrub is
   run, which also adds unused block groups to the unused list, and
   under some circumstances when using a zoned filesystem or async
   discard, which may also add unused block groups to the unused list.

So fix this by:

*) Tracking the number of reserved bytes for the chunk tree per
   transaction, which is the sum of reserved chunk bytes by each
   transaction handle currently being used;

*) When there is not enough free space in the system space_info,
   if there are other transaction handles which reserved chunk space,
   wait for some of them to complete in order to have enough excess
   reserved space released, and then try again. Otherwise proceed with
   the creation of a new system chunk.
