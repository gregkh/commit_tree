scsi: smartpqi: Add stream detection

Enhance performance by adding sequential stream detection for RAID5/RAID6
sequential write requests. Reduce stripe lock contention with full-stripe
write operations.

There is one common stripe lock for each RAID volume that can be set by
either the RAID engine or the AIO engine. The AIO path has I/O request
sizes well below the stripe size resulting in many Read-Modify-Write
operations.

Sending the request to the RAID engine allows for coalescing requests into
full stripe operations resulting in reduced Read-Modify-Write operations.
