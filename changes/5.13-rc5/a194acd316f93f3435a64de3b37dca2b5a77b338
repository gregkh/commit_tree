x86/kprobes: Identify far indirect JMP correctly

Since Grp5 far indirect JMP is FF "mod 101 r/m", it should be
(modrm & 0x38) == 0x28, and near indirect JMP is also 0x38 == 0x20.
So we can mask modrm with 0x30 and check 0x20.
This is actually what the original code does, it also doesn't care
the last bit. So the result code is same.

Thus, I think this is just a cosmetic cleanup.
