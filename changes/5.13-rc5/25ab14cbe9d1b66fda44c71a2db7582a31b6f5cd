MIPS: Avoid handcoded DIVU in `__div64_32' altogether

Remove the inline asm with a DIVU instruction from `__div64_32' and use
plain C code for the intended DIVMOD calculation instead.  GCC is smart
enough to know that both the quotient and the remainder are calculated
with single DIVU, so with ISAs up to R5 the same instruction is actually
produced with overall similar code.

For R6 compiled code will work, but separate DIVU and MODU instructions
will be produced, which are also interlocked, so scalar implementations
will likely not perform as well as older ISAs with their asynchronous MD
unit.  Likely still faster then the generic algorithm though.

This removes a compilation error for R6 however where the original DIVU
instruction is not supported anymore and the MDU accumulator registers
have been removed and consequently GCC complains as to a constraint it
cannot find a register for:

This has passed correctness verification with test_div64 and reduced the
module's average execution time down to 1.0404s from 1.0445s with R3400
@40MHz.  The module's MIPS I machine code has also shrunk by 12 bytes or
3 instructions.
