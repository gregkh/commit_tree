staging: fwserial: fix TIOCSSERIAL implementation

TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
closing_wait parameters.

A non-privileged user has only ever been able to set the since long
deprecated ASYNC_SPD flags and trying to change any other *supported*
feature should result in -EPERM being returned. Setting the current
values for any supported features should return success.

Fix the fwserial implementation which was returning -EPERM also for a
privileged user when trying to change certain unsupported parameters,
and instead return success consistently.
