wireguard: allowedips: allocate nodes in kmem_cache

The previous commit moved from O(n) to O(1) for removal, but in the
process introduced an additional pointer member to a struct that
increased the size from 60 to 68 bytes, putting nodes in the 128-byte
slab. With deployed systems having as many as 2 million nodes, this
represents a significant doubling in memory usage (128 MiB -> 256 MiB).
Fix this by using our own kmem_cache, that's sized exactly right. This
also makes wireguard's memory usage more transparent in tools like
slabtop and /proc/slabinfo.
