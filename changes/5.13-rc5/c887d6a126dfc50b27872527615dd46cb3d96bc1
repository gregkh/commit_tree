KVM: selftests: trivial comment/logging fixes

Some trivial fixes I found while touching related code in this series,
factored out into a separate commit for easier reviewing:

- s/gor/got/ and add a newline in demand_paging_test.c
- s/backing_src/src_type/ in a comment to be consistent with the real
  function signature in kvm_util.c
