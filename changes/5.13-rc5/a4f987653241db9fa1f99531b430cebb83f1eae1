printk: kmsg_dump: remove _nolock() variants

kmsg_dump_rewind() and kmsg_dump_get_line() are lockless, so there is
no need for _nolock() variants. Remove these functions and switch all
callers of the _nolock() variants.

The functions without _nolock() were chosen because they are already
exported to kernel modules.
