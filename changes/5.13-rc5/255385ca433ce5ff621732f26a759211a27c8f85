media: venus: hfi: Add a 6xx boot logic

This patch adds a 6xx specific boot logic. The goal is to share as much
code as possible between 3xx, 4xx and 6xx silicon.

We need to do a different write to WRAPPER_INTR_MASK with an additional
write to CPU_CS_H2XSOFTINTEN_V6 and CPU_CS_X2RPMh_V6.

The other writes are the same for 6xx and non-6xx silicon albeit at
different absolute relative locations to the base of the venus address
space.
