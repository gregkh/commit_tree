KVM: x86/mmu: Mark the PAE roots as decrypted for shadow paging

Set the PAE roots used as decrypted to play nice with SME when KVM is
using shadow paging.  Explicitly skip setting the C-bit when loading
CR3 for PAE shadow paging, even though it's completely ignored by the
CPU.  The extra documentation is nice to have.

Note, there are several subtleties at play with NPT.  In addition to
legacy shadow paging, the PAE roots are used for SVM's NPT when either
KVM is 32-bit (uses PAE paging) or KVM is 64-bit and shadowing 32-bit
NPT.  However, 32-bit Linux, and thus KVM, doesn't support SME.  And
64-bit KVM can happily set the C-bit in CR3.  This also means that
keeping __sme_set(root) for 32-bit KVM when NPT is enabled is
conceptually wrong, but functionally ok since SME is 64-bit only.
Leave it as is to avoid unnecessary pollution.
