kernel/futex: Make futex_wait_requeue_pi() only call fixup_owner()

A small cleanup that allows for fixup_pi_state_owner() only to be called
from fixup_owner(), and make requeue_pi uniformly call fixup_owner()
regardless of the state in which the fixup is actually needed. Of course
this makes the caller's first pi_state->owner != current check redundant,
but that should't really matter.
