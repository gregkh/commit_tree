ice: Fix allowing VF to request more/less queues via virtchnl

Commit 12bb018c538c ("ice: Refactor VF reset") caused a regression
that removes the ability for a VF to request a different amount of
queues via VIRTCHNL_OP_REQUEST_QUEUES. This prevents VF drivers to
either increase or decrease the number of queue pairs they are
allocated. Fix this by using the variable vf->num_req_qs when
determining the vf->num_vf_qs during VF VSI creation.
