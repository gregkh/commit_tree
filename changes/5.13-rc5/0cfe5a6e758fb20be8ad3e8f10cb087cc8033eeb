gpu: host1x: Split up client initalization and registration

In some cases we may need to initialize the host1x client first before
registering it. This commit adds a new helper that will do nothing but
the initialization of the data structure.

At the same time, the initialization is removed from the registration
function. Note, however, that for simplicity we explicitly initialize
the client when the host1x_client_register() function is called, as
opposed to the low-level __host1x_client_register() function. This
allows existing callers to remain unchanged.
