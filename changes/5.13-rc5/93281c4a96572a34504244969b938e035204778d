x86/insn: Add an insn_decode() API

Users of the instruction decoder should use this to decode instruction
bytes. For that, have insn*() helpers return an int value to denote
success/failure. When there's an error fetching the next insn byte and
the insn falls short, return -ENODATA to denote that.

While at it, make insn_get_opcode() more stricter as to whether what has
seen so far is a valid insn and if not.

Copy linux/kconfig.h for the tools-version of the decoder so that it can
use IS_ENABLED().

Also, cast the INSN_MODE_KERN dummy define value to (enum insn_mode)
for tools use of the decoder because perf tool builds with -Werror and
errors out with -Werror=sign-compare otherwise.
