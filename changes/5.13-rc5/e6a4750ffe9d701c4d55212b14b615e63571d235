bpf, xdp: Make bpf_redirect_map() a map operation

Currently the bpf_redirect_map() implementation dispatches to the
correct map-lookup function via a switch-statement. To avoid the
dispatching, this change adds bpf_redirect_map() as a map
operation. Each map provides its bpf_redirect_map() version, and
correct function is automatically selected by the BPF verifier.

A nice side-effect of the code movement is that the map lookup
functions are now local to the map implementation files, which removes
one additional function call.
