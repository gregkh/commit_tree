tty: serial: samsung_tty: Use devm_ioremap_resource

This picks up the non-posted I/O mode needed for Apple platforms to
work properly.

This removes the request/release functions, which are no longer
necessary, since devm_ioremap_resource takes care of that already. Most
other drivers already do it this way, anyway.
