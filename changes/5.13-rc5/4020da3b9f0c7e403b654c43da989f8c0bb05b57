KVM: x86: pending exceptions must not be blocked by an injected event

Injected interrupts/nmi should not block a pending exception,
but rather be either lost if nested hypervisor doesn't
intercept the pending exception (as in stock x86), or be delivered
in exitintinfo/IDT_VECTORING_INFO field, as a part of a VMexit
that corresponds to the pending exception.

The only reason for an exception to be blocked is when nested run
is pending (and that can't really happen currently
but still worth checking for).
