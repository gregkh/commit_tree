ALSA: timer: Fix master timer notification

snd_timer_notify1() calls the notification to each slave for a master
event, but it passes a wrong event number.  It should be +10 offset,
corresponding to SNDRV_TIMER_EVENT_MXXX, but it's incorrectly with
+100 offset.  Casually this was spotted by UBSAN check via syzkaller.
