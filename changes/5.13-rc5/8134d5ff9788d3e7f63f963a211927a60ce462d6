ice: Change ice_vsi_setup_q_map() to not depend on RSS

Currently, ice_vsi_setup_q_map() depends on the VSI's rss_size. However,
the Rx Queue Mapping section of the VSI context has no dependency on RSS.
Instead, limit the maximum number of Rx queues per TC based on the Rx
Queue mapping section of the VSI context, which currently allows for up
to 256 Rx queues per TC.
