mfd: stm32-timers: Avoid clearing auto reload register

The ARR register is cleared unconditionally upon probing, after the maximum
value has been read. This initial condition is rather not intuitive, when
considering the counter child driver. It rather expects the maximum value
by default:
- The counter interface shows a zero value by default for 'ceiling'
  attribute.
- Enabling the counter without any prior configuration makes it doesn't
  count.

The reset value of ARR register is the maximum. So Choice here
is to backup it, and restore it then, instead of clearing its value.
It also fixes the initial condition seen by the counter driver.
