net/tls: Remove redundant initialization of record

record is being initialized to ctx->open_record but this is never
read as record is overwritten later on.  Remove the redundant
initialization.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

net/tls/tls_device.c:421:26: warning: Value stored to 'record' during
its initialization is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
