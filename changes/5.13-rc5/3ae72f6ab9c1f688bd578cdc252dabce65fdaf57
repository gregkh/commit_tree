ALSA: control led: fix memory leak in snd_ctl_led_register

The snd_ctl_led_sysfs_add and snd_ctl_led_sysfs_remove should contain
the refcount operations in pair. However, snd_ctl_led_sysfs_remove fails
to decrease the refcount to zero, which causes device_release never to
be invoked. This leads to memory leak to some resources, like struct
device_private. In addition, we also free some other similar memory
leaks in snd_ctl_led_init/snd_ctl_led_exit.

Fix this by replacing device_del to device_unregister
in snd_ctl_led_sysfs_remove/snd_ctl_led_init/snd_ctl_led_exit.

Note that, when CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE is enabled, put_device will
call kobject_release and delay the release of kobject, which will cause
use-after-free when the memory backing the kobject is freed at once.
