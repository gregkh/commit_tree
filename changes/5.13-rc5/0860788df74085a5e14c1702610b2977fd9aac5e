uacce: Enable IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_IOPF

The IOPF (I/O Page Fault) feature is now enabled independently from the
SVA feature, because some IOPF implementations are device-specific and
do not require IOMMU support for PCIe PRI or Arm SMMU stall.

Enable IOPF unconditionally when enabling SVA for now. In the future, if
a device driver implementing a uacce interface doesn't need IOPF
support, it will need to tell the uacce module, for example with a new
flag.
