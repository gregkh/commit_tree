perf stat: Introduce bpf_counter_ops->disable()

Introduce bpf_counter_ops->disable(), which is used stop counting the
event.

Committer notes:

Added a dummy bpf_counter__disable() to the python binding to avoid
having 'perf test python' failing.

bpf_counter isn't supported in the python binding.
