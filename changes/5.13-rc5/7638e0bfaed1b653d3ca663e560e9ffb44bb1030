SUNRPC: Move fault injection call sites

I've hit some crashes that occur in the xprt_rdma_inject_disconnect
path. It appears that, for some provides, rdma_disconnect() can
take so long that the transport can disconnect and release its
hardware resources while rdma_disconnect() is still running,
resulting in a UAF in the provider.

The transport's fault injection method may depend on the stability
of transport data structures. That means it needs to be invoked
only from contexts that hold the transport write lock.
