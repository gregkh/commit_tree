ethernet:enic: Fix a use after free bug in enic_hard_start_xmit

In enic_hard_start_xmit, it calls enic_queue_wq_skb(). Inside
enic_queue_wq_skb, if some error happens, the skb will be freed
by dev_kfree_skb(skb). But the freed skb is still used in
skb_tx_timestamp(skb).

My patch makes enic_queue_wq_skb() return error and goto spin_unlock()
incase of error. The solution is provided by Govind.
