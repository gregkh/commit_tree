KVM: arm64: Don't advertise FEAT_SPE to guests

Even though KVM sets up MDCR_EL2 to trap accesses to the SPE buffer and
sampling control registers and to inject an undefined exception, the
presence of FEAT_SPE is still advertised in the ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 register,
if the hardware supports it. Getting an undefined exception when accessing
a register usually happens for a hardware feature which is not implemented,
and indeed this is how PMU emulation is handled when the virtual machine
has been created without the KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 feature. Let's be
consistent and never advertise FEAT_SPE, because KVM doesn't have support
for emulating it yet.
