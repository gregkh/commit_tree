ARM: imx: pm-imx27: Include "common.h"

Since commit 879c0e5e0ac7 ("ARM: imx: Remove i.MX27 board files")
the following W=1 build warning is seen:

arch/arm/mach-imx/pm-imx27.c:40:13: warning: no previous prototype for 'imx27_pm_init' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

Fix it by including the "common.h" header file, which
contains the prototype for imx27_pm_init().
