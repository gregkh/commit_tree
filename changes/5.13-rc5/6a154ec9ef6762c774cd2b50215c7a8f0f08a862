usb: webcam: Invalid size of Processing Unit Descriptor

According with USB Device Class Definition for Video Device the
Processing Unit Descriptor bLength should be 12 (10 + bmControlSize),
but it has 11.

Invalid length caused that Processing Unit Descriptor Test Video form
CV tool failed. To fix this issue patch adds bmVideoStandards into
uvc_processing_unit_descriptor structure.

The bmVideoStandards field was added in UVC 1.1 and it wasn't part of
UVC 1.0a.
