siginfo: Move si_trapno inside the union inside _si_fault

It turns out that linux uses si_trapno very sparingly, and as such it
can be considered extra information for a very narrow selection of
signals, rather than information that is present with every fault
reported in siginfo.

As such move si_trapno inside the union inside of _si_fault.  This
results in no change in placement, and makes it eaiser
to extend _si_fault in the future as this reduces the number of
special cases.  In particular with si_trapno included in the union it
is no longer a concern that the union must be pointer aligned on most
architectures because the union follows immediately after si_addr
which is a pointer.

This change results in a difference in siginfo field placement on
sparc and alpha for the fields si_addr_lsb, si_lower, si_upper,
si_pkey, and si_perf.  These architectures do not implement the
signals that would use si_addr_lsb, si_lower, si_upper, si_pkey, and
si_perf.  Further these architecture have not yet implemented the
userspace that would use si_perf.

The point of this change is in fact to correct these placement issues
before sparc or alpha grow userspace that cares.  This change was
discussed[1] and the agreement is that this change is currently safe.
