cifs: remove old dead code

While reviewing a patch clarifying locks and locking hierarchy I
realized some locks were unused.

This commit removes old data and code that isn't actually used
anywhere, or hidden in ifdefs which cannot be enabled from the kernel
config.

* The uid/gid trees and associated locks are left-overs from when
  uid/sid mapping had an extra caching layer on top of the keyring and
  are now unused.
  See commit faa65f07d21e ("cifs: simplify id_to_sid and sid_to_id mapping code")
  from 2012.

* cifs_oplock_break_ops is a left-over from when slow_work was remplaced
  by regular workqueue and is now unused.
  See commit 9b646972467f ("cifs: use workqueue instead of slow-work")
  from 2010.

* CIFSSMBSetAttrLegacy is SMB1 cruft dealing with some legacy
  NT4/Win9x behaviour.

* Remove CONFIG_CIFS_DNOTIFY_EXPERIMENTAL left-overs. This was already
  partially removed in 392e1c5dc9cc ("cifs: rename and clarify CIFS_ASYNC_OP and CIFS_NO_RESP")
  from 2019. Kill it completely.

* Another candidate that was considered but spared is
  CONFIG_CIFS_NFSD_EXPORT which has an empty implementation and cannot
  be enabled by a config option (although it is listed but disabled with
  "BROKEN" as a dep). It's unclear whether this could even function
  today in its current form but it has it's own .c file and Kconfig
  entry which is a bit more involved to remove and might make a come
  back?
