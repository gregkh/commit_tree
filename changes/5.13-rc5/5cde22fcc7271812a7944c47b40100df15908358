media: vivid: fix assignment of dev->fbuf_out_flags

Currently the chroma_flags and alpha_flags are being zero'd with a bit-wise
mask and the following statement should be bit-wise or'ing in the new flag
bits but instead is making a direct assignment.  Fix this by using the |=
operator rather than an assignment.
