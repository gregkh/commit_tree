btrfs: fix error handling in btrfs_del_csums

Error injection stress would sometimes fail with checksums on disk that
did not have a corresponding extent.  This occurred because the pattern
in btrfs_del_csums was

	while (1) {
		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		if (ret < 0)
			break;
	}
	ret = 0;
out:
	btrfs_free_path(path);
	return ret;

If we got an error from btrfs_search_slot we'd clear the error because
we were breaking instead of goto out.  Instead of using goto out, simply
handle the cases where we may leave a random value in ret, and get rid
of the

	ret = 0;
out:

pattern and simply allow break to have the proper error reporting.  With
this fix we properly abort the transaction and do not commit thinking we
successfully deleted the csum.
