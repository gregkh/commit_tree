habanalabs: print f/w boot unknown error

We need to print a message to the kernel log in case we encounter
an unknown error in the f/w boot to help the user understand what
happened.

In addition, we shouldn't print unknown error in case of known errors.

Moreover, in case of warnings/info, we shouldn't return -EIO that will
fail the initialization and mark the device as disabled
