riscv: Only extend kernel reservation if mapped read-only

When the kernel mapping was moved outside of the linear mapping, the
kernel memory reservation was increased, to take into account mapping
granularity.  However, this is done unconditionally, regardless of
whether the kernel memory is mapped read-only or not.

If this extension is not needed, up to 2 MiB may be lost, which has a
big impact on e.g. Canaan K210 (64-bit nommu) platforms with only 8 MiB
of RAM.

Reclaim the lost memory by only extending the reserved region when
needed, i.e. depending on a simplified version of the conditional logic
around the call to protect_kernel_linear_mapping_text_rodata().
