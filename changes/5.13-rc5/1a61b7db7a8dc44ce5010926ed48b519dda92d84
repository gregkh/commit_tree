KVM: x86/mmu: Coalesce TLB flushes across address spaces for gfn range zap

Gather pending TLB flushes across both address spaces when zapping a
given gfn range.  This requires feeding "flush" back into subsequent
calls, but on the plus side sets the stage for further batching
between the legacy MMU and TDP MMU.  It also allows refactoring the
address space iteration to cover the legacy and TDP MMUs without
introducing truly ugly code.
