iwlwifi: mvm: don't WARN if we can't remove a time event

It is not very useful to WARN if we can't send a host command
The firmware is likely in a bad situation and the fact that
we didn't send the host command has an impact on the firmware
only, not on the driver. The driver could clean up all its
state.

Don't WARN in this case, but just leave a smaller note.
