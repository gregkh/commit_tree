netfilter: conntrack: move ct counter to net_generic data

Its only needed from slowpath (sysctl, ctnetlink, gc worker) and
when a new conntrack object is allocated.

Furthermore, each write dirties the otherwise read-mostly pernet
data in struct net.ct, which are accessed from packet path.

Move it to the net_generic data.  This makes struct netns_ct
read-mostly.
