serial: stm32: fix incorrect characters on console

Incorrect characters are observed on console during boot. This issue occurs
when init/main.c is modifying termios settings to open /dev/console on the
rootfs.

This patch adds a waiting loop in set_termios to wait for TX shift register
empty (and TX FIFO if any) before stopping serial port.
