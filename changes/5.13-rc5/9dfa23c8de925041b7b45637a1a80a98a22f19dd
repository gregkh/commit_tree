quota: Add mountpath based quota support

Add syscall quotactl_path, a variant of quotactl which allows to specify
the mountpath instead of a path of to a block device.

The quotactl syscall expects a path to the mounted block device to
specify the filesystem to work on. This limits usage to filesystems
which actually have a block device. quotactl_path replaces the path
to the block device with a path where the filesystem is mounted at.

The global Q_SYNC command to sync all filesystems is not supported for
this new syscall, otherwise quotactl_path behaves like quotactl.
