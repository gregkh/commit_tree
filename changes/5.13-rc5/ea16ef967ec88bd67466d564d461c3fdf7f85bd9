Input: elan_i2c - reduce the resume time for new devices

Newer controllers, such as Voxel, Delbin, Magple, Bobba and others, do not
need to be reset after issuing power-on command, and skipping reset saves
at least 100ms from resume time.

Note that if first attempt of re-initializing device fails we will not be
skipping reset on the subsequent ones.
