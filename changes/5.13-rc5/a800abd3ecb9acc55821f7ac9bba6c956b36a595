net: enetc: move skb creation into enetc_build_skb

We need to build an skb from two code paths now: from the plain RX data
path and from the XDP data path when the verdict is XDP_PASS.

Create a new enetc_build_skb function which contains the essential steps
for building an skb based on the first and last positions of buffer
descriptors within the RX ring.

We also squash the enetc_process_skb function into enetc_build_skb,
because what that function did wasn't very meaningful on its own.

The "rx_frm_cnt++" instruction has been moved around napi_gro_receive
for cosmetic reasons, to be in the same spot as rx_byte_cnt++, which
itself must be before napi_gro_receive, because that's when we lose
ownership of the skb.
