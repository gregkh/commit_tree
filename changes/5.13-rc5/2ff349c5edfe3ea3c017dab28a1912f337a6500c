net/mlx5e: Verify dev is present in some ndos

We will re-use the native NIC port net device instance for the Uplink
representor. While changing profiles private resources are not
available but some ndos are not checking if the netdev is present.
So for those ndos check the netdev is present in the driver before
accessing the private resources.
