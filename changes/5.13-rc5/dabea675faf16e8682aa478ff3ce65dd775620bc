arm64: dts: ls1028a: fix memory node

While enabling EDAC support for the LS1028A it was discovered that the
memory node has a wrong endianness setting as well as a wrong interrupt
assignment. Fix both.

This was tested on a sl28 board. To force ECC errors, you can use the
error injection supported by the controller in hardware (with
CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG enabled):

 # enable error injection
 $ echo 0x100 > /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc0/inject_ctrl
 # flip lowest bit of the data
 $ echo 0x1 > /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc0/inject_data_lo
