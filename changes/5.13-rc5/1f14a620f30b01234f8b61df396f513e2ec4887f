Bluetooth: btusb: Fix failing to init controllers with operation firmware

Some firmware when operation don't may have broken versions leading to
error like the following:

[    6.176482] Bluetooth: hci0: Firmware revision 0.0 build 121 week 7 2021
[    6.177906] bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for intel/ibt-20-0-0.sfi failed with error -2
[    6.177910] Bluetooth: hci0: Failed to load Intel firmware file intel/ibt-20-0-0.sfi (-2)

Since we load the firmware file just to check if its version had changed
comparing to the one already loaded we can just skip since the firmware
is already operation.
