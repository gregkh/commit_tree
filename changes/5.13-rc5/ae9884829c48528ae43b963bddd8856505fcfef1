RDMA/bnxt_re: Depend on bnxt ethernet driver and not blindly select it

The "select" kconfig keyword provides reverse dependency, however it
doesn't check that selected symbol meets its own dependencies. Usually
"select" is used for non-visible symbols, so instead of trying to keep
dependencies in sync with BNXT ethernet driver, simply "depends on" it,
like Kconfig documentation suggest.

* CONFIG_PCI is already required by BNXT
* CONFIG_NETDEVICES and CONFIG_ETHERNET are needed to chose BNXT
