usb: cdns3: Use dma_pool_* api to alloc trb pool

Allocation of DMA coherent memory in atomic context using
dma_alloc_coherent() might fail on platforms with smaller
DMA region.

To fix it, dma_alloc_coherent() is replaced with dma_pool
API to allocate a smaller chunk of DMA coherent memory for
TRB rings.
