mptcp: fix data stream corruption

Maxim reported several issues when forcing a TCP transparent proxy
to use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. He also
provided a clean reproducer.

The problem boils down to 'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming
that only MPTCP will use the given page_frag.

If others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate page fragments,
we can end-up re-using already allocated memory for mptcp_data_frag.

Fix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded data fragment is
located at the current page frag end.

v1 -> v2:
 - added missing fixes tag (Mat)
