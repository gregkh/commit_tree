perf record: Disallow -c and -F option at the same time

It's confusing which one is effective when the both options are given.
The current code happens to use -c in this case but users might not be
aware of it.  We can change it to complain about that instead of relying
on the implicit priority.

Before:

  $ perf record -c 111111 -F 99 true
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.031 MB perf.data (8 samples) ]

  $ perf evlist -F
  cycles: sample_period=111111
  $

After:
  $ perf record -c 111111 -F 99 true
  cannot set frequency and period at the same time
  $

So this change can break existing usages, but I think it's rare to have
both options and it'd be better changing them.
