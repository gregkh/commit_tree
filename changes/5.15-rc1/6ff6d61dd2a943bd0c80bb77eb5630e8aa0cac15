drm/i915: Drop I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_NO_ZEROMAP

The idea behind this param is to support OpenCL drivers with relocations
because OpenCL reserves 0x0 for NULL and, if we placed memory there, it
would confuse CL kernels.  It was originally sent out as part of a patch
series including libdrm [1] and Beignet [2] support.  However, the
libdrm and Beignet patches never landed in their respective upstream
projects so this API has never been used.  It's never been used in Mesa
or any other driver, either.

Dropping this API allows us to delete a small bit of code.
