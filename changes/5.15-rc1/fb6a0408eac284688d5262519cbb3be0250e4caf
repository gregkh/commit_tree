x86: Add support for 0x22/0x23 port I/O configuration space

Define macros and accessors for the configuration space addressed 
indirectly with an index register and a data register at the port I/O 
locations of 0x22 and 0x23 respectively.

This space is defined by the Intel MultiProcessor Specification for the 
IMCR register used to switch between the PIC and the APIC mode[1], by 
Cyrix processors for their configuration[2][3], and also some chipsets.

Given the lack of atomicity with the indirect addressing a spinlock is 
required to protect accesses, although for Cyrix processors it is enough 
if accesses are executed with interrupts locally disabled, because the 
registers are local to the accessing CPU, and IMCR is only ever poked at 
by the BSP and early enough for interrupts not to have been configured 
yet.  Therefore existing code does not have to change or use the new 
spinlock and neither it does.

Put the spinlock in a library file then, so that it does not get pulled 
unnecessarily for configurations that do not refer it.

Convert Cyrix accessors to wrappers so as to retain the brevity and 
clarity of the `getCx86' and `setCx86' calls.
