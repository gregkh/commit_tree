btrfs: drop unnecessary ASSERT from btrfs_submit_direct()

When on SINGLE block group, btrfs_get_io_geometry() will return "the
size of the block group - the offset of the logical address within the
block group" as geom.len. Since we allow up to 8 GiB zone size on zoned
filesystem, we can have up to 8 GiB block group, so can have up to 8 GiB
geom.len as well. With this setup, we easily hit the "ASSERT(geom.len <=
INT_MAX);".

The ASSERT looks like to guard btrfs_bio_clone_partial() and bio_trim()
which both take "int" (now u64 due to the previous patch). So to be
precise the ASSERT should check if clone_len <= UINT_MAX. But actually,
clone_len is already capped by bio.bi_iter.bi_size which is unsigned
int. So the ASSERT is not necessary.

Drop the ASSERT and properly compare submit_len and geom.len in u64.
Then, let the implicit casting to convert it to u64.
