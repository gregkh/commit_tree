xfrm: Add possibility to set the default to block if we have no policy

As the default we assume the traffic to pass, if we have no
matching IPsec policy. With this patch, we have a possibility to
change this default from allow to block. It can be configured
via netlink. Each direction (input/output/forward) can be
configured separately. With the default to block configuered,
we need allow policies for all packet flows we accept.
We do not use default policy lookup for the loopback device.
