dt-bindings: net: fsl,fec: improve the binding a bit

This patch improves the yaml a bit according to Rob Herring comments:
1) normalize interrupt-names property, there is no reason to support
random order.
2) validate each string in clock-names property.
3) add constraints for fsl,num-tx-queues/fsl,num-rx-queues property.
4) change additionalProperties to false in order to do strict checking.
