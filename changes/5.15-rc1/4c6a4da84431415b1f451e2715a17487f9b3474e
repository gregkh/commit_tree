net: ipa: don't use ipa_clock_get() in "ipa_main.c"

We need the hardware to be powered starting at the config stage of
initialization when the IPA driver probes.  And we need it powered
when the driver is removed, at least until the deconfig stage has
completed.

Replace callers of ipa_clock_get() in ipa_probe() and ipa_exit(),
calling pm_runtime_get_sync() instead.  Replace the corresponding
callers of ipa_clock_put(), calling pm_runtime_put() instead.

The only error we expect when getting power would occur when the
system is suspended.  The ->probe and ->remove driver callbacks
won't be called when suspended, so issue a WARN() call if an error
is seen getting power.
