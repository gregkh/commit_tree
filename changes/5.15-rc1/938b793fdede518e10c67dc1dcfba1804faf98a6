habanalabs: expose state dump

To improve the user's ability to debug the case where a workload that
is part of executing training/inference of a topology is getting stuck,
we need to add a 'core dump' each time a CS times-out. The 'core dump'
shall contain all relevant Sync Manager information and corresponding
fence values.

The most recent dumps shall be accessible via debugfs, under
'state_dump' node. Reading from the node will provide the oldest dump
available. Writing an integer value X will discard X dumps, starting
with the oldest one, i.e. subsequent read will now return newer
dumps.
