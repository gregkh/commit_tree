mm: remove flush_kernel_dcache_page

flush_kernel_dcache_page is a rather confusing interface that implements a
subset of flush_dcache_page by not being able to properly handle page
cache mapped pages.

The only callers left are in the exec code as all other previous callers
were incorrect as they could have dealt with page cache pages.  Replace
the calls to flush_kernel_dcache_page with calls to flush_dcache_page,
which for all architectures does either exactly the same thing, can
contains one or more of the following:

 1) an optimization to defer the cache flush for page cache pages not
    mapped into userspace
 2) additional flushing for mapped page cache pages if cache aliases
    are possible
