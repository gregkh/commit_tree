drivers: base: cacheinfo: Get rid of DEFINE_SMP_CALL_CACHE_FUNCTION()

DEFINE_SMP_CALL_CACHE_FUNCTION() was usefel before the CPU hotplug rework
to ensure that the cache related functions are called on the upcoming CPU
because the notifier itself could run on any online CPU.

The hotplug state machine guarantees that the callbacks are invoked on the
upcoming CPU. So there is no need to have this SMP function call
obfuscation. That indirection was missed when the hotplug notifiers were
converted.

This also solves the problem of ARM64 init_cache_level() invoking ACPI
functions which take a semaphore in that context. That's invalid as SMP
function calls run with interrupts disabled. Running it just from the
callback in context of the CPU hotplug thread solves this.
