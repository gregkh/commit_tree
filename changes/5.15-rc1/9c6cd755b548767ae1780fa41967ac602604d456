iio: st-sensors: Remove some unused includes and add some that should be there

The st-sensors drivers have changed in structure over time, and includes
have not always kept up with this.  Let's bring them back to nearer
the ideal.

Identified with the  include-what-you-use tool and careful checking of
its suggestions.

Note I haven't been particularly aggressive here, so this is just the
cases where the include obviously isn't needed rather than the more
subtle corners.

Note I took the opportunity to add mod_devicetable.h as I generally
prefer to see that when acpi or of match tables are present.
