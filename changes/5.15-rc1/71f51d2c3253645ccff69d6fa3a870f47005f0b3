KVM: x86/mmu: Add detailed page size stats

Existing KVM code tracks the number of large pages regardless of their
sizes. Therefore, when large page of 1GB (or larger) is adopted, the
information becomes less useful because lpages counts a mix of 1G and 2M
pages.

So remove the lpages since it is easy for user space to aggregate the info.
Instead, provide a comprehensive page stats of all sizes from 4K to 512G.
