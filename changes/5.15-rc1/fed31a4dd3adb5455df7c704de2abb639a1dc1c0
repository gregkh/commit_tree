rcu: Fix macro name CONFIG_TASKS_RCU_TRACE

This commit fixes several typos where CONFIG_TASKS_RCU_TRACE should
instead be CONFIG_TASKS_TRACE_RCU.  Among other things, these typos
could cause CONFIG_TASKS_TRACE_RCU_READ_MB=y kernels to suffer from
memory-ordering bugs that could result in false-positive quiescent
states and too-short grace periods.
