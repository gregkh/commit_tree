ARM: 9099/1: crypto: rename 'mod_init' & 'mod_exit' functions to be module-specific

Rename module_init & module_exit functions that are named
"mod_init" and "mod_exit" so that they are unique in both the
System.map file and in initcall_debug output instead of showing
up as almost anonymous "mod_init".

This is helpful for debugging and in determining how long certain
module_init calls take to execute.
