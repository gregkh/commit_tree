drm/i915/icl: Use revid->stepping tables

Switch ICL to use a revid->stepping table as we're trying to do on all
platforms going forward.  While we're at it, let's include some
additional steppings that have popped up, even if we don't yet have any
workarounds tied to those steppings (we probably need to audit our
workaround list soon to see if any of the bounds have moved or if new
workarounds have appeared).

Note that the current bspec table is missing information about how to
map PCI revision ID to GT/display steppings; it only provides an SoC
stepping.  The mapping to GT/display steppings (which aren't always the
same as the SoC stepping) used to be in the bspec, but was apparently
dropped during an update in Nov 2019; I've made my changes here based on
an older bspec snapshot that still had the necessary information.  We've
requested that the missing information be restored.

I'm only including the production revids in the table here since we're
past the point at which we usually stop trying to support pre-production
hardware.  An appropriate check is added to
intel_detect_preproduction_hw() to print an error and taint the kernel
just in case someone still tries to load the driver on old
pre-production hardware.

v2:
 - Drop pre-production steppings and add error/taint at startup when
   loading on pre-production hardware.
