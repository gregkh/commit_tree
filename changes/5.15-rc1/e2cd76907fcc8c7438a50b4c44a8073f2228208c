dt-bindings: usb: mtk-xhci: add compatible for mt8195

There are 4 USB controllers on MT8195, the controllers (IP1~IP3,
exclude IP0) have a wrong default SOF/ITP interval which is
calculated from the frame counter clock 24Mhz by default, but
in fact, the frame counter clock is 48Mhz, so we should set
the accurate interval according to 48Mhz. Here add a new compatible
for MT8195, it's also supported in driver. But the first controller
(IP0) has no such issue, we prefer to use generic compatible,
e.g. mt8192's compatible.
