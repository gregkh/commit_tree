ima: Add digest and digest_len params to the functions to measure a buffer

This patch performs the final modification necessary to pass the buffer
measurement to callers, so that they provide a functionality similar to
ima_file_hash(). It adds the 'digest' and 'digest_len' parameters to
ima_measure_critical_data() and process_buffer_measurement().

These functions calculate the digest even if there is no suitable rule in
the IMA policy and, in this case, they simply return 1 before generating a
new measurement entry.
