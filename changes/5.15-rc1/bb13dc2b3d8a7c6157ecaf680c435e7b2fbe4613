staging: vchiq: Set $CONFIG_BCM2835_VCHIQ to imply $CONFIG_VCHIQ_CDEV

Before $CONFIG_VCHIQ_CDEV was defined, the vchiq cdev used to be created
unconditionally when CONFIG_BCM2835_VCHIQ=y. When an earlier commit
introduced the new config, its default behavior was set to disabled,
which might surprise some unsuspecting users.  Hence, modify
CONFIG_BCM2835_VCHIQ to imply CONFIG_VCHIQ_CDEV
