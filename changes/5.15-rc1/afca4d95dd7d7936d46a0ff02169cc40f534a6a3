Drivers: hv: Make portions of Hyper-V init code be arch neutral

The code to allocate and initialize the hv_vp_index array is
architecture neutral. Similarly, the code to allocate and
populate the hypercall input and output arg pages is architecture
neutral.  Move both sets of code out from arch/x86 and into
utility functions in drivers/hv/hv_common.c that can be shared
by Hyper-V initialization on ARM64.

No functional changes. However, the allocation of the hypercall
input and output arg pages is done differently so that the
size is always the Hyper-V page size, even if not the same as
the guest page size (such as with ARM64's 64K page size).
