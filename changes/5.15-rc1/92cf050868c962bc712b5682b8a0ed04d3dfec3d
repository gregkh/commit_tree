drm/amd/pm: restore user customized OD settings properly for NV1x

The customized OD settings can be divided into two parts: those
committed ones and non-committed ones.
  - For those changes which had been fed to SMU before S3/S4/Runpm
    suspend kicked, they are committed changes. They should be properly
    restored and fed to SMU on S3/S4/Runpm resume.
  - For those non-committed changes, they are restored only without feeding
    to SMU.
