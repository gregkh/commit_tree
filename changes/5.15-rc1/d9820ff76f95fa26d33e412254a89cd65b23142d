ARC: mm: switch pgtable_t back to struct page *

So far ARC pgtable_t has not been struct page based to avoid extra
page_address() calls involved. However the differences are down to
noise and get in the way of using generic code, hence this patch.

This also allows us to reuse generic THP depost/withdraw code.

There's some additional consideration for PGDIR_SHIFT in 4K page config.
Now due to page tables being PAGE_SIZE deep only, the address split
can't be really arbitrary.
