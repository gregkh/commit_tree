perf report: Add tools/arch/x86/include/asm/amd-ibs.h

This is a tools/-side patch for the patch that adds the original copy
of the IBS header file, in arch/x86/include/asm/.

We also add an entry to check-headers.sh, so future changes continue
to be copied.

Committer notes:

Had to add this

  -#include <asm/msr-index.h>
  +#include "msr-index.h"

And change the check-headers.sh entry to ignore this line when diffing
with the original kernel header.

This is needed so that we can use 'perf report' on a perf.data with IBS
data on a !x86 system, i.e. building on ARM fails without this as there
is no asm/msr-index.h there.

This was done on the next patch in this series and is done for things
like Intel PT and ARM CoreSight.
