net/mlx5e: Remove mdev from mlx5e_build_indir_tir_ctx_common()

In order to drop a dependency to mdev and make the function more
universal, stop passing mdev to mlx5e_build_indir_tir_ctx_common() and
pass transport domain directly instead. It also prepares this function
to be used in other contexts that need a custom transport domain, such
as hairpin.
