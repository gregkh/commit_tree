block: ensure the bdi is freed after inode_detach_wb

inode_detach_wb references the "main" bdi of the inode.  With the
recent change to move the bdi from the request_queue to the gendisk
this causes a guaranteed use after free when using certain cgroup
configurations.  The big itself is older through as any non-default
inode reference (e.g. an open file descriptor) could have injected
this use after free even before that.
