scsi: core: Add scsi_prot_ref_tag() helper

We are about to remove the request pointer from struct scsi_cmnd and that
will complicate getting to the ref_tag via t10_pi_ref_tag() in the various
drivers. Introduce a helper function to retrieve the reference tag so
drivers will not have to worry about the details.
