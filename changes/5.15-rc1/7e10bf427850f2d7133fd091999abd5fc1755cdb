drm/msm/dp: replug event is converted into an unplug followed by an plug events

Remove special handling of replug interrupt and instead treat replug event
as a sequential unplug followed by a plugin event. This is needed to meet
the requirements of DP Link Layer CTS test case 4.2.1.3.

Changes in V2:
-- add fixes statement

Changes in V3:
-- delete EV_HPD_REPLUG_INT

Fixes: f21c8a276c2d ("drm/msm/dp: handle irq_hpd with sink_count = 0 correctly")
