drm/vkms: Use offset-adjusted shadow-plane mappings and output

For framebuffers with non-zero offset fields, shadow-plane helpers
provide a pointer to the first byte of the contained data. Use it in
vkms.

Also provide use the offset-adjusted data address for the writeback
job's output buffers. Output framebuffers with non-zero offsets now
have their content written to the correct location.
