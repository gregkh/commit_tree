ASoC: Intel: bytct_rt5640: Add a separate "Headset Mic 2" DAPM pin for the mic on the 2nd jack

In order to be able to do jack-detection reporting for the
mic contact on the 2nd jack found on some devices, the
DAPM topology needs to have a separate DAPM pin/input for that
microphone, instead of re-using the "Internal Mic" pin which is
normally used together with the IN1P input of the codec.

Using the "Internal Mic" dapm-pin-switch for this in a snd_soc_jack_pin to
report hotplug events causes the "Internal Mic" pin to get deactivated
when unplugging a headset from the 2nd jack, thus turning off the actual
Internal Mic (typically a pair of digital mics on devices with 2 jacks).
