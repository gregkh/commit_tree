ASoC: ics43432: add CMM-4030D-261 support

Despite minimal datasheet differences, the driver seems
perfectly compatible with CMM-4030D-261.

Tested CMM-4030D-261 to work with this changes:

/ {
        cmm4030d: cmm4030d {
                #sound-dai-cells = <0>;
                compatible = "cui,cmm-4030d-261";
        };

        sound_mic {
                compatible = "simple-audio-card";
                simple-audio-card,name = "i2s mem mic";
                simple-audio-card,format = "i2s";
                simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&sound_master>;
                simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&sound_master>;
                sound_master: simple-audio-card,cpu {
                        sound-dai = <&ssi2>;
                        system-clock-frequency = <2822400>;
                };
                simple-audio-card,codec {
                        sound-dai = <&cmm4030d>;
                };
        };
};
