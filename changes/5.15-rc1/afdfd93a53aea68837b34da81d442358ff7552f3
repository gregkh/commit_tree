arm64: mte: optimize GCR_EL1 modification on kernel entry/exit

Accessing GCR_EL1 and issuing an ISB can be expensive on some
microarchitectures. Although we must write to GCR_EL1, we can
restructure the code to avoid reading from it because the new value
can be derived entirely from the exclusion mask, which is already in
a GPR. Do so.
