fs/ntfs3: Add compression

This patch adds different types of NTFS-applicable compressions:
- lznt
- lzx
- xpress
Latter two (lzx, xpress) implement Windows Compact OS feature and
were taken from ntfs-3g system comression plugin authored by Eric Biggers
(https://github.com/ebiggers/ntfs-3g-system-compression)
which were ported to ntfs3 and adapted to Linux Kernel environment.
