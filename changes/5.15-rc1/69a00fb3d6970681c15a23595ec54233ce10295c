clk: divider: Implement and wire up .determine_rate by default

.determine_rate is meant to replace .round_rate. The former comes with a
benefit which is especially relevant on 32-bit systems: since
.determine_rate uses an "unsigned long" (compared to a "signed long"
which is used by .round_rate) the maximum value on 32-bit systems
increases from 2^31 (or approx. 2.14GHz) to 2^32 (or approx. 4.29GHz).

Implement .determine_rate in addition to .round_rate so drivers that are
using clk_divider_{ro_,}ops can benefit from this by default. Keep the
.round_rate callback for now since some drivers rely on
clk_divider_ops.round_rate being implemented.
