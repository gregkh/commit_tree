kernfs: use VFS negative dentry caching

If there are many lookups for non-existent paths these negative lookups
can lead to a lot of overhead during path walks.

The VFS allows dentries to be created as negative and hashed, and caches
them so they can be used to reduce the fairly high overhead alloc/free
cycle that occurs during these lookups.

Use the kernfs node parent revision to identify if a change has been
made to the containing directory so that the negative dentry can be
discarded and the lookup redone.
