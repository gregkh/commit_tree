staging: r8188eu: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

Fix the following fallthrough warnings:

drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_mlme_ext.c:1498:3: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_wlan_util.c:1113:4: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_wlan_util.c:1147:4: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_wlan_util.c:1405:3: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang.
