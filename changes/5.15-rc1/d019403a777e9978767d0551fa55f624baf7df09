ASoC: rt1015: remove possible unused variable `bclk_ms'

bclk_ms is possible unused by using the given config (see [1]).

sound/soc/codecs/rt1015.c:724:2: warning: Value stored to 'bclk_ms' is
never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
           bclk_ms = frame_size > 32;
           ^         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition, bclk_ms is meaningless and confusing after applying commit
a5db2ca51367 ("ASoC: rt1015: remove unneeded variables in rt1015_priv").
The "> 32" in the expression looks like a typo but it was not.

Let's remove the confusing variable bclk_ms.
