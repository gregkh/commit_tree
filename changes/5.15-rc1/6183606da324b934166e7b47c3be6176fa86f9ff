drm/msm/dsi: rename dual DSI to bonded DSI

We are preparing to support two independent DSI hosts in the DSI/DPU
code. To remove possible confusion (as both configurations can be
referenced as dual DSI) let's rename old "dual DSI" (two DSI hosts
driving single device, with clocks being locked) to "bonded DSI".
