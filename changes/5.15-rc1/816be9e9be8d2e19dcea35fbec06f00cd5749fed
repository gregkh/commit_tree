KVM: nVMX: Don't evaluate "emulation required" on nested VM-Exit

Use the "internal" variants of setting segment registers when stuffing
state on nested VM-Exit in order to skip the "emulation required"
updates.  VM-Exit must always go to protected mode, and all segments are
mostly hardcoded (to valid values) on VM-Exit.  The bits of the segments
that aren't hardcoded are explicitly checked during VM-Enter, e.g. the
selector RPLs must all be zero.
