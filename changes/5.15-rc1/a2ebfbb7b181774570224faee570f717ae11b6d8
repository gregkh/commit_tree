net/mlx5: DR, Add support for update FTE

Add the support for update FTE, which is needed for cases where there are
multiple rules with the same match. In such case fs_core will merge the
actions and call update FTE to update current FTE. Since we don't want to
disrupt the traffic, we will add the new duplicate rule, and only then
remove the old duplicate rule.
