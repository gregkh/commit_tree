libnvdimm/labels: Add type-guid helpers

In preparation for CXL label support, which does not have the type-guid
concept, wrap the existing users with nsl_set_type_guid, and
nsl_validate_type_guid. Recall that the type-guid is a value in the ACPI
NFIT table to indicate how the memory range is used / should be
presented to upper layers.
