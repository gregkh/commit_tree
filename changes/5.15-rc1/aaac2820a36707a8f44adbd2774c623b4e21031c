selftests/ftrace: Add clear_dynamic_events() to test cases

Add a function to remove all dynamic events from the tracing directory. It
requires a loop as some of the dynamic events may depend on others being
removed first. Also add a safety that prevents it from looping infinitely
due to a bug where an event never gets removed.
