ASoC: Intel: boards: harden codec property handling

In current ACPI-based devices, the DSDT does not include any of the
properties required by the codec driver. This is not an ACPI
limitation proper since the _DSD method could be used, as done for
Camera and SoundWire in newer platforms. For legacy devices, there is
unfortunately no other option than using a work-around: we add
properties to the codec device from the machine driver.

To avoid any issues with the codec driver being unbound, we need to
keep a reference to the codec device until the card is removed.
