platform/x86: hp_accel: Remove _INI method call

According to ACPI specification the _INI method must be called
when device is enumerated first time. After that there is no need
to repeat the procedure. Convert the lis3lv02d_acpi_init() to be
a stub (Note, we may not remove it because it is called unconditionally
by the accelerometer main driver).
