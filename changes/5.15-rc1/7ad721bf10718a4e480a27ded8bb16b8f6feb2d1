sched: Don't report SCHED_FLAG_SUGOV in sched_getattr()

SCHED_FLAG_SUGOV is supposed to be a kernel-only flag that userspace
cannot interact with. However, sched_getattr() currently reports it
in sched_flags if called on a sugov worker even though it is not
actually defined in a UAPI header. To avoid this, make sure to
clean-up the sched_flags field in sched_getattr() before returning to
userspace.
