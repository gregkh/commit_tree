net_sched: refactor TC action init API

TC action ->init() API has 10 parameters, it becomes harder
to read. Some of them are just boolean and can be replaced
by flags. Similarly for the internal API tcf_action_init()
and tcf_exts_validate().

This patch converts them to flags and fold them into
the upper 16 bits of "flags", whose lower 16 bits are still
reserved for user-space. More specifically, the following
kernel flags are introduced:

TCA_ACT_FLAGS_POLICE replace 'name' in a few contexts, to
distinguish whether it is compatible with policer.

TCA_ACT_FLAGS_BIND replaces 'bind', to indicate whether
this action is bound to a filter.

TCA_ACT_FLAGS_REPLACE  replaces 'ovr' in most contexts,
means we are replacing an existing action.

TCA_ACT_FLAGS_NO_RTNL replaces 'rtnl_held' but has the
opposite meaning, because we still hold RTNL in most
cases.

The only user-space flag TCA_ACT_FLAGS_NO_PERCPU_STATS is
untouched and still stored as before.

I have tested this patch with tdc and I do not see any
failure related to this patch.
