clk: Align provider-specific CLK_* bit definitions

The definition of CLK_MULTIPLIER_ROUND_CLOSEST is not aligned to the two
bit definitions next to it.  A deeper inspection reveals that the
alignment of CLK_MULTIPLIER_ROUND_CLOSEST does match the most common
alignment.

Align the bit definitions for the various provider types throughout the
file at 40 columns, to increase uniformity.
