xhci: fix unsafe memory usage in xhci tracing

Removes static char buffer usage in the following decode functions:
	xhci_decode_trb()
	xhci_decode_ptortsc()

Caller must provide a buffer to use.
In tracing use __get_str() as recommended to pass buffer.

Minor chanes are needed in xhci debugfs code as these functions are also
used there. Changes include moving XHCI_MSG_MAX definititon from
xhci-trace.h to xhci.h
