tracing/boot: Fix to loop on only subkeys

Since the commit e5efaeb8a8f5 ("bootconfig: Support mixing
a value and subkeys under a key") allows to co-exist a value
node and key nodes under a node, xbc_node_for_each_child()
is not only returning key node but also a value node.
In the boot-time tracing using xbc_node_for_each_child() to
iterate the events, groups and instances, but those must be
key nodes. Thus it must use xbc_node_for_each_subkey().
