HID: thrustmaster: clean up Makefile and adapt quirks

Commit c49c33637802 ("HID: support for initialization of some Thrustmaster
wheels") messed up the Makefile and quirks during the refactoring of this
commit.

Luckily, ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py warns on non-existing configs:

HID_TMINIT
Referencing files: drivers/hid/Makefile, drivers/hid/hid-quirks.c

Following the discussion (see Link), CONFIG_HID_THRUSTMASTER is the
intended config for CONFIG_HID_TMINIT and the file hid-tminit.c was
actually added as hid-thrustmaster.c.

So, clean up Makefile and adapt quirks to that refactoring.
