crypto: qat - remove empty sriov_configure()

Remove the empty implementation of sriov_configure() and set the
sriov_configure member of the pci_driver structure to NULL.
This way, if a user tries to enable VFs on a device, when kernel and
driver are built with CONFIG_PCI_IOV=n, the kernel reports an error
message saying that the driver does not support SRIOV configuration via
sysfs.
