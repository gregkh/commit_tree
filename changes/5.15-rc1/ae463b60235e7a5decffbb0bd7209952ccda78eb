scsi: lpfc: Fix NVMe support reporting in log message

The NVMe support indicator in log message 6422 is displaying a field that
was initialized but never set to indicate NVMe support.  Remove obsolete
nvme_support element from the lpfc_hba structure and change log message to
display NVMe support status as reported in SLI4 Config Parameters mailbox
command.
