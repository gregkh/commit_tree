ARM: ixp4xx: Delete Avila boardfiles

This board is replaced with the corresponding device tree.
There is also the "loft" board which is just a Kconfi entry
and which reuses the same boardfile.

If there is interest in the Loft variant and someone is willing
to test I can create a special DT superset for this board,
which only differs in PCI set-up.
