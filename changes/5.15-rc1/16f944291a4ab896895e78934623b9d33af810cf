thermal/drivers/tegra-soctherm: Silence message about clamped temperature

The Tegra soctherm driver prints message about the clamped temperature
trip each time when thermal core disables the low/high trip. The message
is confusing and creates illusion that driver is malfunctioning. Turn that
noisy info message into a debug message.
