habanalabs: signal/wait change sync object reset flow

Currently the SOB reset was in fence release function which happens
only at the CS wraparound during the CS allocation time.

In order to support the new encapsulated signals reservation feature,
we need to move the SOB reset to an earlier phase because this SOB
could reach it's max value very fast using the signal reservation.
