mm/pagemap: add mmap_assert_locked() annotations to find_vma*()

find_vma() and variants need protection when used.  This patch adds
mmap_assert_lock() calls in the functions.

To make sure the invariant is satisfied, we also need to add a
mmap_read_lock() around the get_user_pages_remote() call in
get_arg_page().  The lock is not strictly necessary because the mm has
been newly created, but the extra cost is limited because the same mutex
was also acquired shortly before in __bprm_mm_init(), so it is hot and
uncontended.
