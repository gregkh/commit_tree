drm/armada: Remove prepare/cleanup_fb hooks

All they do is refcount the fb, which the atomic helpers already do.

This is was necessary with the legacy helpers and I guess just carry
over in the conversion. drm_plane_state always has a full reference
for its ->fb pointer during its entire lifetime,
see __drm_atomic_helper_plane_destroy_state()
