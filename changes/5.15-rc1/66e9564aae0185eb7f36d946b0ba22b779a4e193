staging: r8188eu: Fix incorrect types in arguments

GCC + Sparse emit warnings of passing incorrect type in arguments of
some functions because of different base types. Fix them by changing
the types of the parameters of the above-mentioned functions.
In the meantime, remove the unnecessary casts of those arguments
which are then passed to memcpy() within those same functions.
