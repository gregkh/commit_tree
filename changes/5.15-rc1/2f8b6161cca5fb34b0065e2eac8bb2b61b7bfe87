net/mlx5: Lag, fix multipath lag activation

When handling FIB_EVENT_ENTRY_REPLACE event for a new multipath route,
lag activation can be missed if a stale (struct lag_mp)->mfi pointer
exists, which was associated with an older multipath route that had been
removed.

Normally, when a route is removed, it triggers mlx5_lag_fib_event(),
which handles FIB_EVENT_ENTRY_DEL and clears mfi pointer. But, if
mlx5_lag_check_prereq() condition isn't met, for example when eswitch is
in legacy mode, the fib event is skipped and mfi pointer becomes stale.

Fix by resetting mfi pointer to NULL in mlx5_deactivate_lag().
