dt-bindings: arm: fsl: Add DHCOM PicoITX and DHCOM DRC02 boards

Add DH electronics DHCOM PicoITX and DHCOM DRC02 boards. The DHCOM DRC02
device can only house a SOM with iMX6S and not with iMX6DL, due to some
thermal design consideration. But for compatible fsl,imx6dl is chosen,
because fsl,imx6s isn't available, the iMX6S is basically a iMX6DL with
one CPU core disabled and therefore the kernel discerns the iMX6S/iMX6DL
automatically.
