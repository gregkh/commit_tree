ALSA: usb-audio: Move media-controller API quirk into quirk_flags

The devices that can have media-controller API entries are currently
specified via tables in quirks-table.h, as a part of descriptor
override.  This can fit better to the new quirk_flags, as we just need
a matching with the given ID and create the MC entries accordingly.
