bpf: Enable BPF_TRAMP_F_IP_ARG for trampolines with call_get_func_ip

Enabling BPF_TRAMP_F_IP_ARG for trampolines that actually need it.

The BPF_TRAMP_F_IP_ARG adds extra 3 instructions to trampoline code
and is used only by programs with bpf_get_func_ip helper, which is
added in following patch and sets call_get_func_ip bit.

This patch ensures that BPF_TRAMP_F_IP_ARG flag is used only for
trampolines that have programs with call_get_func_ip set.
