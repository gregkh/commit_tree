dma-direct: add support for dma_coherent_default_memory

Add an option to allocate uncached memory for dma_alloc_coherent from
the global dma_coherent_default_memory.  This will allow to move
arm-nommu (and eventually other platforms) to use generic code for
allocating uncached memory from a pre-populated pool.

Note that this is a different pool from the one that platforms that
can remap at runtime use for GFP_ATOMIC allocations for now, although
there might be opportunities to eventually end up with a common codebase
for the two use cases.
