udf: Get rid of 0-length arrays

Declare variable length arrays using [] instead of the old-style
declarations using arrays with 0 members. Also comment out entries in
structures beyond the first variable length array (we still do keep them
in comments as a reminder there are further entries in the structure
behind the variable length array). Accessing such entries needs a
careful offset math anyway so it is safer to not have them declared.
