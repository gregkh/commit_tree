riscv: Remove non-standard linux,elfcorehdr handling

RISC-V uses platform-specific code to locate the elf core header in
memory.  However, this does not conform to the standard
"linux,elfcorehdr" DT bindings, as it relies on a reserved memory node
with the "linux,elfcorehdr" compatible value, instead of on a
"linux,elfcorehdr" property under the "/chosen" node.

The non-compliant code can just be removed, as the standard behavior is
already implemented by platform-agnostic handling in the FDT core code.
