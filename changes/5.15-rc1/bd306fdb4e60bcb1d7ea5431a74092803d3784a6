arm64: dts: imx8mm-venice-gw71xx: fix USB OTG VBUS

The GW71xx has a USB Type-C connector with USB 2.0 signaling. GPIO1_12
is the power-enable to the TPS25821 Source controller and power switch
responsible for monitoring the CC pins and enabling VBUS. Therefore
GPIO1_12 must always be enabled and the vbus output enable from the
IMX8MM can be ignored.

To fix USB OTG VBUS enable a pull-up on GPIO1_12 to always power the
TPS25821 and change the regulator output to GPIO1_10 which is
unconnected.
