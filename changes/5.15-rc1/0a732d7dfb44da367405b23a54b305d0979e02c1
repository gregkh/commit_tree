serdev: Split and export serdev_acpi_get_uart_resource()

The same as for I²C Serial Bus resource split and export
serdev_acpi_get_uart_resource(). We have already a few users
one of which is converted here.

Rationale of this is to consolidate parsing UART Serial Bus
resource in one place as it's done, e.g., for I²C Serial Bus.
