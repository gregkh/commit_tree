staging: r8188eu: ctrl vendor req index is not used

The index for r8188eu's vendor-specific control requests is not used.
Remove the index parameter from usbctrl_vendorreq and pass index 0 to
usb_control_msg.

This patch is an adaptation of commit 3d0be94f62fd ("staging: rtl8188eu:
ctrl vendor req index is not used") for the new r8188eu driver.
