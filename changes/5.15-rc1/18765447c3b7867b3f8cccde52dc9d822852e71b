sched/sysctl: Move extern sysctl declarations to sched.h

Since commit '8a99b6833c88(sched: Move SCHED_DEBUG sysctl to debugfs)',
SCHED_DEBUG sysctls are moved to debugfs, so these extern sysctls in
include/linux/sched/sysctl.h are no longer needed for sysctl.c, even
some are no longer needed.

So move those extern sysctls that needed by kernel/sched/debug.c to
kernel/sched/sched.h, and remove others that are no longer needed.
