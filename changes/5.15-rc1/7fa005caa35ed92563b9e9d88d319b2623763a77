vfio/pci: Introduce vfio_pci_core.ko

Now that vfio_pci has been split into two source modules, one focusing on
the "struct pci_driver" (vfio_pci.c) and a toolbox library of code
(vfio_pci_core.c), complete the split and move them into two different
kernel modules.

As before vfio_pci.ko continues to present the same interface under sysfs
and this change will have no functional impact.

Splitting into another module and adding exports allows creating new HW
specific VFIO PCI drivers that can implement device specific
functionality, such as VFIO migration interfaces or specialized device
requirements.
