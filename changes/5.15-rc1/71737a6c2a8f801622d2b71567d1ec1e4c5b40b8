cpuidle: pseries: Do not cap the CEDE0 latency in fixup_cede0_latency()

Currently in fixup_cede0_latency() code, we perform the fixup the
CEDE(0) exit latency value only if minimum advertized extended CEDE
latency values are less than 10us. This was done so as to not break
the expected behaviour on POWER8 platforms where the advertised
latency was higher than the default 10us, which would delay the SMT
folding on the core.

However, after the earlier patch "cpuidle/pseries: Fixup CEDE0 latency
only for POWER10 onwards", we can be sure that the fixup of CEDE0
latency is going to happen only from POWER10 onwards. Hence
unconditionally use the minimum exit latency provided by the platform.
