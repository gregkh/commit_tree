parport: remove non-zero check on count

The check for count appears to be incorrect since a non-zero count
check occurs a couple of statements earlier. Currently the check is
always false and the dev->port->irq != PARPORT_IRQ_NONE part of the
check is never tested and the if statement is dead-code. Fix this
by removing the check on count.

Note that this code is pre-git history, so I can't find a sha for
it.
