net/mlx5: DR, fix a potential use-after-free bug

In line 849 (#1), "mlx5dr_htbl_put(cur_htbl);" drops the reference to
cur_htbl and may cause cur_htbl to be freed.

However, cur_htbl is subsequently used in the next line, which may result
in an use-after-free bug.

Fix this by calling mlx5dr_err() before the cur_htbl is put.
