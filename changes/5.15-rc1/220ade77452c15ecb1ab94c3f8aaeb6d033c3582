bonding: 3ad: fix the concurrency between __bond_release_one() and bond_3ad_state_machine_handler()

Some time ago, I reported a calltrace issue
"did not find a suitable aggregator", please see[1].
After a period of analysis and reproduction, I find
that this problem is caused by concurrency.

Before the problem occurs, the bond structure is like follows:

bond0 - slaver0(eth0) - agg0.lag_ports -> port0 - port1
                      \
                        port0
      \
        slaver1(eth1) - agg1.lag_ports -> NULL
                      \
                        port1

If we run 'ifenslave bond0 -d eth1', the process is like below:

excuting __bond_release_one()
|
bond_upper_dev_unlink()[step1]
|                       |                       |
|                       |                       bond_3ad_lacpdu_recv()
|                       |                       ->bond_3ad_rx_indication()
|                       |                       spin_lock_bh()
|                       |                       ->ad_rx_machine()
|                       |                       ->__record_pdu()[step2]
|                       |                       spin_unlock_bh()
|                       |                       |
|                       bond_3ad_state_machine_handler()
|                       spin_lock_bh()
|                       ->ad_port_selection_logic()
|                       ->try to find free aggregator[step3]
|                       ->try to find suitable aggregator[step4]
|                       ->did not find a suitable aggregator[step5]
|                       spin_unlock_bh()
|                       |
|                       |
bond_3ad_unbind_slave() |
spin_lock_bh()
spin_unlock_bh()

step1: already removed slaver1(eth1) from list, but port1 remains
step2: receive a lacpdu and update port0
step3: port0 will be removed from agg0.lag_ports. The struct is
       "agg0.lag_ports -> port1" now, and agg0 is not free. At the
	   same time, slaver1/agg1 has been removed from the list by step1.
	   So we can't find a free aggregator now.
step4: can't find suitable aggregator because of step2
step5: cause a calltrace since port->aggregator is NULL

To solve this concurrency problem, put bond_upper_dev_unlink()
after bond_3ad_unbind_slave(). In this way, we can invalid the port
first and skip this port in bond_3ad_state_machine_handler(). This
eliminates the situation that the slaver has been removed from the
list but the port is still valid.
