s390/boot: make stacks part of the decompressor's image

Instead of using constant addresses for the normal and dump-info stacks,
allocate both stacks in the decompressor's image and load the stack register
in a position-independent manner.

This will allow loading and entering the decompressor at an arbitrary
memory address without corrupting the content at the fixed addresses
used until now for both stacks. This is one of the prerequisites
for being able to kexec the decompressor from its load address without
relocating it first.
