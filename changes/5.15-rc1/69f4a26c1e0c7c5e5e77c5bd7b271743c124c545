iomap: support reading inline data from non-zero pos

The existing inline data support only works for cases where the entire
file is stored as inline data.  For larger files, EROFS stores the
initial blocks separately and the remainder of the file ("file tail")
adjacent to the inode.  Generalise inline data to allow reading the
inline file tail.  Tails may not cross a page boundary in memory.

We currently have no filesystems that support tails and writing,
so that case is currently disabled (see iomap_write_begin_inline).
