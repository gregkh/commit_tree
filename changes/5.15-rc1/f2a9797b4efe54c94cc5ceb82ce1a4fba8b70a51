Revert "usb: xhci-mtk: Do not use xhci's virt_dev in drop_endpoint"

I find the patch introduce some issues, e.g.
1. oops happens when xhci_gen_setup() failed, and hash is not init
   but try to destroy it;
2. memory leakage happens when fail to insert ep, need free sch_ep,
   or insert ep after insert int list;
3. memory leakage happens when fail to allocate sch_array, need destroy
   rhashtable;
4. it's better to check ep->hcpriv when drop ep;

so prefer to revert this patch, and resend it after the issues are fixed.

This reverts commit b8731209958a1dffccc2888121f4c0280c990550.
