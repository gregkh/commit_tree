x86/hyperv: fix for unwanted manipulation of sched_clock when TSC marked unstable

Marking TSC as unstable has a side effect of marking sched_clock as
unstable when TSC is still being used as the sched_clock. This is not
desirable. Hyper-V ultimately uses a paravirtualized clock source that
provides a stable scheduler clock even on systems without TscInvariant
CPU capability. Hence, mark_tsc_unstable() call should be called _after_
scheduler clock has been changed to the paravirtualized clocksource. This
will prevent any unwanted manipulation of the sched_clock. Only TSC will
be correctly marked as unstable.
