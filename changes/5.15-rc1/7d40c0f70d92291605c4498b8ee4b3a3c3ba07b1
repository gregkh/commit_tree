arm64: PCI: Support root bridge preparation for Hyper-V

Currently at root bridge preparation, the corresponding ACPI device will
be set as the companion, however for a Hyper-V virtual PCI root bridge,
there is no corresponding ACPI device, because a Hyper-V virtual PCI
root bridge is discovered via VMBus rather than ACPI table. In order to
support this, we need to make pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() work with
cfg->parent being NULL.

Use a NULL pointer as the ACPI device if there is no corresponding ACPI
device, and this is fine because: 1) ACPI_COMPANION_SET() can work with
the second parameter being NULL, 2) semantically, if a NULL pointer is
set via ACPI_COMPANION_SET(), ACPI_COMPANION() (the read API for this
field) will return NULL, and since ACPI_COMPANION() may return NULL, so
users must have handled the cases where it returns NULL, and 3) since
there is no corresponding ACPI device, it would be wrong to use any
other value here.
