media: atomisp: pci: Remove checks before kfree/kvfree

Removed checks for pointers != NULL before freeing memory. If kvfree()
and kfree() are given NULL pointers no operations are performed, so
there is no need for the above-mentioned checks. Coccinelle detected the
second of the two unnecessary checks.
