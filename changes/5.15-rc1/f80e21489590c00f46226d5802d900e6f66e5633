hrtimer: Unbreak hrtimer_force_reprogram()

Since the recent consoliation of reprogramming functions,
hrtimer_force_reprogram() is affected by a check whether the new expiry
time is past the current expiry time.

This breaks the NOHZ logic as that relies on the fact that the tick hrtimer
is moved into the future. That means cpu_base->expires_next becomes stale
and subsequent reprogramming attempts fail as well until the situation is
cleaned up by an hrtimer interrupts.

For some yet unknown reason this leads to a complete stall, so for now
partially revert the offending commit to a known working state. The root
cause for the stall is still investigated and will be fixed in a subsequent
commit.
