firmware: arm_scmi: Add message passing abstractions for transports

Add abstractions for future transports using message passing, such as
virtio. Derive the abstractions from the shared memory abstractions.

Abstract the transport SDU through the opaque struct scmi_msg_payld.
Also enable the transport to determine all other required information
about the transport SDU.
