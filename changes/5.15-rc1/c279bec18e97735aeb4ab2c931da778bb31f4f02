drm/i915/guc/slpc: Add get max/min freq hooks

Add helpers to read the min/max frequency being used
by SLPC. This is done by send a H2G command which forces
SLPC to update the shared data struct which can then be
read. These helpers will be used in a sysfs patch later
on.

v2: Address review comments (Michal W)
v3: Return err in case of query failure (Michal W)
v4: Move decode_min/max_freq to this patch
