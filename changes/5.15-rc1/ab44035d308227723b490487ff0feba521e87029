octeontx2-pf: Allow VLAN priority also in ntuple filters

VLAN TCI is a 16 bit field which includes Priority(3 bits),
CFI(1 bit) and VID(12 bits). Currently ntuple filters support
installing rules to steer packets based on VID only.
This patch extends that support such that filters can
be installed for entire VLAN TCI.
