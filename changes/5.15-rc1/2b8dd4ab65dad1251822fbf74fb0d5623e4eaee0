x86/resctrl: Calculate the index from the configuration type

resctrl uses cbm_idx() to map a closid to an index in the configuration
array. This is based on a multiplier and offset that are held in the
resource.

To merge the resources, the resctrl arch code needs to calculate the
index from something else, as there will only be one resource.

Decide based on the staged configuration type. This makes the static
mult and offset parameters redundant.
