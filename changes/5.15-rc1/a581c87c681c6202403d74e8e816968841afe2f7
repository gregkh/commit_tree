Sample code from NXP, as well as experiments on i.MX8MM with RAW10
capture with an OV5640 sensor connected over CSI-2, showed that the
TWO_8BIT_SENSOR field of the CSICR3 register needs to be set for formats
larger than 8 bits. Do so, even if the reference manual doesn't clearly
describe the effect of the field.
