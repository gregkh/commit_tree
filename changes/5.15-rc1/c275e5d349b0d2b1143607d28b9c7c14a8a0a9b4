media: atomisp: fix the uninitialized use and rename "retvalue"

Inside function mt9m114_detect(), variable "retvalue" could
be uninitialized if mt9m114_read_reg() returns error, however, it
is used in the later if statement, which is potentially unsafe.

The local variable "retvalue" is renamed to "model" to avoid
confusion.
