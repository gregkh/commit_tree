ksmbd: Fix read on the uninitialized pointer sess

There is a error handling case that passes control to label out_err
without pointer sess being assigned a value. The unassigned pointer
may be any garbage value and so the test of rc < 0 && sess maybe
true leading to sess being passed to the call to ksmbd_session_destroy.
Fix this by setting sess to NULL in this corner case.
