ravb: Remove checks for unsupported internal delay modes

The EtherAVB instances on the R-Car E3/D3 and RZ/G2E SoCs do not support
TX clock internal delay modes, and the EtherAVB driver prints a warning
if an unsupported "rgmii-*id" PHY mode is specified, to catch buggy
DTBs.

Commit a6f51f2efa742df0 ("ravb: Add support for explicit internal
clock delay configuration") deprecated deriving the internal delay mode
from the PHY mode, in favor of explicit configuration using the now
mandatory "rx-internal-delay-ps" and "tx-internal-delay-ps" properties,
thus delegating the warning to the legacy fallback code.

Since explicit configuration of a (valid) internal clock delay
configuration is enforced by validating device tree source files against
DT binding files, and all upstream DTS files have been converted as of
commit a5200e63af57d05e ("arm64: dts: renesas: rzg2: Convert EtherAVB to
explicit delay handling"), the checks in the legacy fallback code can be
removed.
