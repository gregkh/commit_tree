kdb: Get rid of redundant kdb_register_flags()

Commit e4f291b3f7bb ("kdb: Simplify kdb commands registration")
allowed registration of pre-allocated kdb commands with pointer to
struct kdbtab_t. Lets switch other users as well to register pre-
allocated kdb commands via:
- Changing prototype for kdb_register() to pass a pointer to struct
  kdbtab_t instead.
- Embed kdbtab_t structure in kdb_macro_t rather than individual params.

With these changes kdb_register_flags() becomes redundant and hence
removed. Also, since we have switched all users to register
pre-allocated commands, "is_dynamic" flag in struct kdbtab_t becomes
redundant and hence removed as well.
