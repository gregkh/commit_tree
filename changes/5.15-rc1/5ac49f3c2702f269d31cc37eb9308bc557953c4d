iavf: use mutexes for locking of critical sections

As follow-up to the discussion with Jakub Kicinski about iavf locking
being insufficient [1] convert iavf to use mutexes instead of bitops.
The locking logic is kept as is, just a drop-in replacement of
enum iavf_critical_section_t with separate mutexes.
The only difference is that the mutexes will be destroyed before the
module is unloaded.
