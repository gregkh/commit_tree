bus: mhi: core: Set BHI/BHIe offsets on power up preparation

Set the BHI and/or BHIe offsets in mhi_prepare_for_power_up(),
rearrange the function, and remove the equivalent from
mhi_async_power_up(). This helps consolidate multiple checks
in different parts of the driver and can help MHI fail early on
before power up begins if the offsets are not read correctly.
