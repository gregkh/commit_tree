locking/rtmutex: Squash !RT tasks to DEFAULT_PRIO

Ensure all !RT tasks have the same prio such that they end up in FIFO
order and aren't split up according to nice level.

The reason why nice levels were taken into account so far is historical. In
the early days of the rtmutex code it was done to give the PI boosting and
deboosting a larger coverage.
