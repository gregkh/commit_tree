net: dsa: build tag_8021q.c as part of DSA core

Upcoming patches will add tag_8021q related logic to switch.c and
port.c, in order to allow it to make use of cross-chip notifiers.
In addition, a struct dsa_8021q_context *ctx pointer will be added to
struct dsa_switch.

It seems fairly low-reward to #ifdef the *ctx from struct dsa_switch and
to provide shim implementations of the entire tag_8021q.c calling
surface (not even clear what to do about the tag_8021q cross-chip
notifiers to avoid compiling them). The runtime overhead for switches
which don't use tag_8021q is fairly small because all helpers will check
for ds->tag_8021q_ctx being a NULL pointer and stop there.

So let's make it part of dsa_core.o.
