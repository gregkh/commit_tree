ALSA: hda: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch is an attempt to slightly simplify the resource management
in HD-audio code, by using some device-managed APIs.  Only a few
resources like PCI enablement and PCI resources managed via devres,
but most of the rest code dealing with HD-audio core stuff couldn't be
changed so much, hence the changes in this patch are pretty small in
the end.  A special caveat is needed for the card object: we can't
move the card object release into devres, because the driver is
involved with the component stuff and its unregistiration doesn't work
well from devres release at all.
