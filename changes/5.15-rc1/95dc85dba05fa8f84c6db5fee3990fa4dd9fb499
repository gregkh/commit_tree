ALSA: hda: conexant: Turn off EAPD at suspend, too

Conexant codecs have a workaround for the noise at shutdown to turn
off EAPD, but it wasn't applied at suspend.  In the later patch, we'll
switch from reboot_notify callback to the general suspend-at-shutdown,
so let's apply the workaround to the suspend case, too.
