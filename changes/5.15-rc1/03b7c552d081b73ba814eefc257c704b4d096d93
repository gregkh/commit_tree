maintainers: Update freedesktop.org IRC channels

Like many free software projects, freedesktop.org issued a non-binding
recommendation for projects to migrate from Freenode to OFTC [1]. As
such, freedesktop.org entries in the MAINTAINERS file are out-of-date as
the respective channels have moved. Update the file to point to the
right network.

v2: Correct typo in commit message pointed out by Lukas and Jonathan.
Add Hector's ack.

v3: Add acks.
