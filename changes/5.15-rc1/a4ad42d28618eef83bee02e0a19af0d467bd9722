ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Support multiple format configs

A module can have two kinds of set params, as per topology requirements.
For example, one pre-init and one post-init. But currently, there is
support for just one type, as the format_config.

This patch extends the format_configs to 4, so as to be able to support
pre-init, post-init and post-bind type of set params, for the same
module, simultaneously.
