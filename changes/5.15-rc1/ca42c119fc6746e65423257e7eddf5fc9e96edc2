platform/x86: acer-wmi: Add Turbo Mode support for Acer PH315-53

The Acer Predator Helios series (usually denoted by PHxxx-yy) features
a particular key above the keyboard named "TURBO".
The turbo key does 3 things:
1. Set all fan's speeds to TURBO mode
2. Overclocks the CPU and GPU in the safe range
3. Turn on an LED just below the turbo button

All the above actions are operating using WMI function calls,
and there is no custom OC level for turbo. It acts as a flag
for enabling turbo mode instead of telling processors to use
a specific multiply of power (e.g. 1.3x of power).

I've run some benchmark tests and it worked fine:

GpuTest 0.7.0
http://www.geeks3d.com

Module: FurMark
Normal mode Score: 7289 points (FPS: 121)
Turbo mode Score: 7675 points (FPS: 127)
Settings:
- 1920x1080 fullscreen
- antialiasing: Off
- duration: 60000 ms

Renderer:
- GeForce RTX 2060/PCIe/SSE2
- OpenGL: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 460.32.03

This feature is presented by Acer officially and should not harm
hardware in any case.

A challenging part of implementing this feature is that calling
overclock function requires knowing the exact count of fans
for CPU and GPU of each model, which to the best of my
knowledge is not available in the kernel.

So after checking the official PredatorSense application methods, it
turned out they have provided the software the list of fans in each model.
I have access to the mentioned list, and all similar PH-iii-jj can be
added easily by matching "DMI_PRODUCT_NAME".

Creating a specific file for the Acer gaming features is not possible
because the current in use WMI event GUID is required for the turbo button
and it's not possible to register multiple listeners on a single WMI event.
