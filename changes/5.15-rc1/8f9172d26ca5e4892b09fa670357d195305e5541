staging: r8188eu: remove unneeded DBG_88E call from rtl8188e_Add_RateATid

Remove unneeded DBG_88E macro call from the rtl8188e_Add_RateATid
function in hal/rtl8188e_cmd.c, as it is not particularly clear in my
opinion, and we should strive towards use of existing kernel machinery
for debugging purposes.
