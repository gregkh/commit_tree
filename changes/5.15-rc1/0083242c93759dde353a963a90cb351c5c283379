sched/topology: Skip updating masks for non-online nodes

The scheduler currently expects NUMA node distances to be stable from
init onwards, and as a consequence builds the related data structures
once-and-for-all at init (see sched_init_numa()).

Unfortunately, on some architectures node distance is unreliable for
offline nodes and may very well change upon onlining.

Skip over offline nodes during sched_init_numa(). Track nodes that have
been onlined at least once, and trigger a build of a node's NUMA masks
when it is first onlined post-init.
