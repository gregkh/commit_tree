staging: r8188eu: remove function rtw_hal_free_xmit_priv

Remove function rtw_hal_free_xmit_priv in hal/hal_intf.c and its
declaration in include/hal_intf.h, as well as the single call line in
core/rtw_xmit.c. This function now essentially checks a function
pointer which will always be NULL (due to previous patches) and
therefore will never be called.
