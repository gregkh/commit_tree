net: hns3: refine function hns3_set_default_feature()

Currently, the driver sets default feature for netdev->features,
netdev->hw_features, netdev->vlan_features and
netdev->hw_enc_features separately. It's fussy, because most
of the feature bits are same. So refine it by copy value from
netdev->features.
