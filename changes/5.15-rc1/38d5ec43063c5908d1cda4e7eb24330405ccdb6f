drm/i915/guc: Ensure request ordering via completion fences

If two requests are on the same ring, they are explicitly ordered by the
HW. So, a submission fence is sufficient to ensure ordering when using
the new GuC submission interface. Conversely, if two requests share a
timeline and are on the same physical engine but different context this
doesn't ensure ordering on the new GuC submission interface. So, a
completion fence needs to be used to ensure ordering.
