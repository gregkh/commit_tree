dm ima: measure data on table clear

For a given block device, an inactive table slot contains the parameters
to configure the device with.  The inactive table can be cleared
multiple times, accidentally or maliciously, which may impact the
functionality of the device, and compromise the system.  Therefore it is
important to measure and log the event when a table is cleared.

Measure device parameters, and table hashes when the inactive table slot
is cleared.
