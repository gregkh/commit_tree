drm/i915/gem: Check object_can_migrate from object_migrate

We don't roll them together entirely because there are still a couple
cases where we want a separate can_migrate check.  For instance, the
display code checks that you can migrate a buffer to LMEM before it
accepts it in fb_create.  The dma-buf import code also uses it to do an
early check and return a different error code if someone tries to attach
a LMEM-only dma-buf to another driver.

However, no one actually wants to call object_migrate when can_migrate
has failed.  The stated intention is for self-tests but none of those
actually take advantage of this unsafe migration.
