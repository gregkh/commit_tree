usb: isp1760: clean never read udc_enabled warning

When CONFIG_USB_ISP1761_UDC is not enabled the udc_enabled variable is
never used since it is short circuited before in the logic operations.

This would trigger the following warning by clang analyzer:

drivers/usb/isp1760/isp1760-core.c:490:2: warning: Value stored to 'udc_enabled' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
        udc_enabled = ((devflags & ISP1760_FLAG_ISP1763) ||
        ^
drivers/usb/isp1760/isp1760-core.c:490:2: note: Value stored to 'udc_enabled' is never read

Just swap the other of the operands in the logic operations.
