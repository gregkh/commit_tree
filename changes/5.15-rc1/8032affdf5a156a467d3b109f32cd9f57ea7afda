arm64: dts: ti: k3-am642-evm: Add pwm nodes

ecap0 can be configured to use pad ECAP0_IN_APWM_OUT (D18) which has a
signal connected to Pin 1 of J12 on EVM. Add support for adding this
pinmux so that pwm can be observed on pin 1 of Header J12

Also mark all un-used epwm and ecap pwm nodes as disabled.
