soundwire: stream: don't abort bank switch on Command_Ignored/-ENODATA

This change is needed for support of mockup devices, which by
construction will not provide any answer to a bank switch, but it's
also legit for regular cases.

If for some reason a device loses sync and cannot handle a bank
switch, we should go ahead anyways. The devices can always resync
later.

The only case where the error flow should be used is when there is a
Command_Aborted composite answer from SoundWire devices.
