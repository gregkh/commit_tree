scsi: BusLogic: Avoid unbounded vsprintf() use

Existing blogic_msg() invocations do not appear to overrun its internal
buffer of a fixed length of 100, which would cause stack corruption, but
it's easy to miss with possible further updates and a fix is cheap in
performance terms, so limit the output produced into the buffer by using
vscnprintf() rather than vsprintf().
