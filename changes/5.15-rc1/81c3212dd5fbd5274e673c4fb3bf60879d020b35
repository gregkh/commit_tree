Revert "drm/panel-simple: Support for delays between GPIO & regulator"

This reverts commit 18a1488bf1e13fc3fc96d7948466b2166067c6c8.

Those delays were added to support the Samsung ATNA33XC20
panel. However, we've moving that to its own panel driver and out of
panel-simple. That means we don't need the ability to specify this
delay.

NOTE: it's unlikely we want to keep this delay "just in case" some
other panel needs it. The enable-gpio and the power supply are really
supposed to be different ways to specify the same thing: the main
enable of the panel. Supporting a delay between them doesn't really
make sense.
