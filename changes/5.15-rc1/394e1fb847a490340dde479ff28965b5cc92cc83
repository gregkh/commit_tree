Revert "ARM: dts: imx6: Use correct SDMA script for SPI cores"

There are two ways for SDMA accessing SPBA devices: one is SDMA->AIPS
->SPBA(masterA port), another is SDMA->SPBA(masterC port). Please refer
to the 'Figure 58-1. i.MX 6Dual/6Quad SPBA connectivity' of i.mx6DQ
Reference Manual. SDMA provide the corresponding app_2_mcu/mcu_2_app and
shp_2_mcu/mcu_2_shp script for such two options. So both AIPS and SPBA
scripts should keep the same behaviour, the issue only caught in AIPS
script sounds not solide.
The issue is more likely as the ecspi errata
ERR009165(http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdf):
eCSPI: TXFIFO empty flag glitch can cause the current FIFO transfer to
           be sent twice
So revert commit 'dd4b487b32a3' firstly.
