ARM: config: aspeed: Regenerate defconfigs

A make defconfig && make savedefconfig was performed for each
configuration.

Most changes are due to options moving around, except for the following
which are due to changing defaults:

 - SECCOMP is enabled by default as of commit 282a181b1a0d ("seccomp:
   Move config option SECCOMP to arch/Kconfig") in v5.9

 - The soc drivers ASPEED_LPC_CTRL, ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP and ASPEED_P2A_CTRL
   are enabled by default when the aspeed platform is enabled, as of
   commit 592693a1f881 ("soc: aspeed: Improve kconfig") in v5.9

 - The ZBOOT_ROM_TEXT/BSS values fall out of the defconfig as of
   commit 39c3e304567a ("ARM: 8984/1: Kconfig: set default
   ZBOOT_ROM_TEXT/BSS value to 0x0") in v5.8

 - I2C_MUX is selected by MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT, probably as of about
   v5.8. It was in the config as it is required bt the PCA I2C muxes
   that enabled it
