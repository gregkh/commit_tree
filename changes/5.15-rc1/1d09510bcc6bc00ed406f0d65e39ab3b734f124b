mm/page_isolation: tracing: trace all test_pages_isolated failures

Some test_pages_isolated failure conditions don't include trace points.
For debugging issues caused by "pinned" pages, make sure to trace all
calls whether they succeed or fail.  In this case, a failure case did not
result in a trace point.  So add the missing failure case in
test_pages_isolated traces.
