clk: ralink: avoid to set 'CLK_IS_CRITICAL' flag for gates

'clk_init_data' for gates is setting up 'CLK_IS_CRITICAL'
flag for all of them. This was being doing because some
drivers of this SoC might not be ready to use the clock
and we don't wanted the kernel to disable them since default
behaviour without clock driver was to set all gate bits to
enabled state. After a bit more testing and checking driver
code it is safe to remove this flag and just let the kernel
to disable those gates that are not in use. No regressions
seems to appear.
