KVM: VMX: Skip pointless MSR bitmap update when setting EFER

Split setup_msrs() into vmx_setup_uret_msrs() and an open coded refresh
of the MSR bitmap, and skip the latter when refreshing the user return
MSRs during an EFER load.  Only the x2APIC MSRs are dynamically exposed
and hidden, and those are not affected by a change in EFER.
