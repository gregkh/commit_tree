iommu: Split 'addr_merge' argument to iommu_pgsize() into separate parts

The 'addr_merge' parameter to iommu_pgsize() is a fabricated address
intended to describe the alignment requirements to consider when
choosing an appropriate page size. On the iommu_map() path, this address
is the logical OR of the virtual and physical addresses.

Subsequent improvements to iommu_pgsize() will need to check the
alignment of the virtual and physical components of 'addr_merge'
independently, so pass them in as separate parameters and reconstruct
'addr_merge' locally.

No functional change.
