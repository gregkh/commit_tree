btrfs: allow idmapped SNAP_CREATE/SUBVOL_CREATE ioctls

Creating subvolumes and snapshots is one of the core features of btrfs
and is even available to unprivileged users. Make it possible to use
subvolume and snapshot creation on idmapped mounts. This is a fairly
straightforward operation since all the permission checking helpers are
already capable of handling idmapped mounts. So we just need to pass
down the mount's userns.
