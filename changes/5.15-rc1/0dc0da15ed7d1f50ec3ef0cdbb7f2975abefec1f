RDMA/mlx5: Rework custom driver QP type creation

Starting from commit 2b1f747071c5 ("RDMA/core: Allow drivers to disable
restrack DB") the restrack is able to handle non-standard QP types either.

That change allows us to rewrite custom QP calls to their IB/core
counterparts, so we will use general QP creation flow even for the driver
QP types.
