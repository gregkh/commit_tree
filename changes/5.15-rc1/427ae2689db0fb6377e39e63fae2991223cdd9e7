ALSA: core: Add device-managed page allocator helper

This is a preparation for allowing devres usages more widely in
various sound drivers.  As a first step, this patch adds a new
allocator function, snd_devm_alloc_pages(), to manage the allocated
pages via devres, so that the pages will be automagically released as
device unbinding.

Unlike the old snd_dma_alloc_pages(), the new function returns
directly the snd_dma_buffer pointer.  The caller needs NULL-check for
the allocation error appropriately.

Also, since a real device pointer is mandatory for devres,
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_CONTINUOUS or SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_VMALLOC type can't be used
for this function.
