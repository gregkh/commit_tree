xfs: move xfs_inactive call to xfs_inode_mark_reclaimable

Move the xfs_inactive call and all the other debugging checks and stats
updates into xfs_inode_mark_reclaimable because most of that are
implementation details about the inode cache.  This is preparation for
deferred inactivation that is coming up.  We also move it around
xfs_icache.c in preparation for deferred inactivation.
