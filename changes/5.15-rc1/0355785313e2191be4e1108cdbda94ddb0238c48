powerpc: Add "-z notext" flag to disable diagnostic

Object files used to link .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms1 have many
R_PPC64_ADDR64 relocations in non-SHF_WRITE sections. There are many
text relocations (e.g. in .rela___ksymtab_gpl+* and .rela__mcount_loc
sections) in a -pie link and are disallowed by LLD:

  ld.lld: error: can't create dynamic relocation R_PPC64_ADDR64 against local symbol in readonly segment; recompile object files with -fPIC or pass '-Wl,-z,notext' to allow text relocations in the output
  >>> defined in arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.o
  >>> referenced by arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.o:(__restart_table+0x10)

Newer GNU ld configured with "--enable-textrel-check=error" will report
an error as well:

  $ ld-new -EL -m elf64lppc -pie ... -o .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms1 ...
  ld-new: read-only segment has dynamic relocations

Add "-z notext" to suppress the errors. Non-CONFIG_RELOCATABLE builds
use the default -no-pie mode and thus R_PPC64_ADDR64 relocations can be
resolved at link-time.
