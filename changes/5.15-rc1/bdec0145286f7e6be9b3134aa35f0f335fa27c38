ARM: 9114/1: oabi-compat: rework sys_semtimedop emulation

sys_oabi_semtimedop() is one of the last users of set_fs() on Arm. To
remove this one, expose the internal code of the actual implementation
that operates on a kernel pointer and call it directly after copying.

There should be no measurable impact on the normal execution of this
function, and it makes the overly long function a little shorter, which
may help readability.

While reworking the oabi version, make it behave a little more like
the native one, using kvmalloc_array() and restructure the code
flow in a similar way.

The naming of __do_semtimedop() is not very good, I hope someone can
come up with a better name.

One regression was spotted by kernel test robot <rong.a.chen@intel.com>
and fixed before the first mailing list submission.
