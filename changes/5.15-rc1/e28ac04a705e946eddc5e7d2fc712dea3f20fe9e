ASoC: intel: atom: Revert PCM buffer address setup workaround again

We worked around the breakage of PCM buffer setup by the commit
65ca89c2b12c ("ASoC: intel: atom: Fix breakage for PCM buffer address
setup"), but this isn't necessary since the CONTINUOUS buffer type
also sets runtime->dma_addr since commit f84ba106a018 ("ALSA:
memalloc: Store snd_dma_buffer.addr for continuous pages, too").
Let's revert the change again.
