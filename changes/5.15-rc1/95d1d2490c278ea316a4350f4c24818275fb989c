netdevice: move xdp_rxq within netdev_rx_queue

Both struct netdev_rx_queue and struct xdp_rxq_info are cacheline
aligned. This causes extra padding before and after the xdp_rxq
member. Move the member upfront, so that it's naturally aligned.

Before:
	/* size: 256, cachelines: 4, members: 6 */
	/* sum members: 160, holes: 1, sum holes: 40 */
	/* padding: 56 */
	/* paddings: 1, sum paddings: 36 */
	/* forced alignments: 1, forced holes: 1, sum forced holes: 40 */

After:
	/* size: 192, cachelines: 3, members: 6 */
	/* padding: 32 */
	/* paddings: 1, sum paddings: 36 */
	/* forced alignments: 1 */
