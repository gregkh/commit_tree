drm/i915/guc: Add LRC descriptor context lookup array

Add LRC descriptor context lookup array which can resolve the
intel_context from the LRC descriptor index. In addition to lookup, it
can determine if the LRC descriptor context is currently registered with
the GuC by checking if an entry for a descriptor index is present.
Future patches in the series will make use of this array.
