KVM: X86: Set host DR6 only on VMX and for KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT

Commit c77fb5fe6f03 ("KVM: x86: Allow the guest to run with dirty debug
registers") allows the guest accessing to DRs without exiting when
KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT and we need to ensure that they are synchronized
on entry to the guest---including DR6 that was not synced before the commit.

But the commit sets the hardware DR6 not only when KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT,
but also when KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED.  The second case is unnecessary
and just leads to a more case which leaks stale DR6 to the host which has
to be resolved by unconditionally reseting DR6 in kvm_arch_vcpu_put().

Even if KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT, however, setting the host DR6 only matters
on VMX because SVM always uses the DR6 value from the VMCB.  So move this
line to vmx.c and make it conditional on KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT.
