can: netlink: allow user to turn off unsupported features

The sanity checks on the control modes will reject any request related
to an unsupported features, even turning it off.

Example on an interface which does not support CAN-FD:

$ ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 fd off
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported

This patch lets such command go through (but requests to turn on an
unsupported feature are, of course, still denied).
