clk: qcom: apcs-msm8916: Flag a53mux instead of a53pll as critical

The clock source for MSM8916 cpu cores is like below.

                        |\
         a53pll --------| \ a53mux     +------+
                        | |------------| cpus |
     gpll0_vote --------| /            +------+
                        |/

So a53mux rather than a53pll is actually the parent clock of cpu cores.
It makes more sense to flag a53mux as critical instead, so that when
either a53pll or gpll0_vote is used by cpu cores, the clock will be kept
enabled while the other can be disabled.
