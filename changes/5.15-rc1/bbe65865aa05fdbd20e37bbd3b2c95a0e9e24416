samples: bpf: Convert xdp_redirect_map to XDP samples helper

Use the libbpf skeleton facility and other utilities provided by XDP
samples helper.

Since get_mac_addr is already provided by XDP samples helper, we drop
it. Also convert to XDP samples helper similar to prior samples to
minimize duplication of code.
