drm/i915/gt: remove explicit CNL handling from intel_sseu.c

CNL is the only platform with GRAPHICS_VER == 10. With its removal we
don't need to handle that version anymore.

Also we can now reduce the max number of slices: the call to
intel_sseu_set_info() with the highest number of slices comes from SKL
and BDW with 3 slices. Recent platforms actually increase the
number of subslices so the number of slices remain 1.
