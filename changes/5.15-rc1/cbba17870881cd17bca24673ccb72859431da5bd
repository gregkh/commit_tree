riscv: dts: microchip: mpfs-icicle: Fix serial console

Currently, nothing is output on the serial console, unless
"console=ttyS0,115200n8" or "earlycon" are appended to the kernel
command line.  Enable automatic console selection using
chosen/stdout-path by adding a proper alias, and configure the expected
serial rate.

While at it, add aliases for the other three serial ports, which are
provided on the same micro-USB connector as the first one.
