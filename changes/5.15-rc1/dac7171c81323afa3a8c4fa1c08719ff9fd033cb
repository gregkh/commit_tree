iwlwifi: remove ACPI_SAR_NUM_TABLES definition

This definition was only used to pass the size of the tables in the FW
API to the iwl_sar_select_profile() function, but we should actually
pass the definition from the FW API file.  We don't have the concept
of tables in the ACPI definition, so we can remove it.
