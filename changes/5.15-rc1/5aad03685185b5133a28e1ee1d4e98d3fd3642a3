tools/resolve_btfids: Emit warnings and patch zero id for missing symbols

Kernel functions referenced by .BTF_ids may be changed from global to static
and get inlined or get renamed/removed, and thus disappears from BTF.
This causes kernel build failure when resolve_btfids do id patch for symbols
in .BTF_ids in vmlinux. Update resolve_btfids to emit warning messages and
patch zero id for missing symbols instead of aborting kernel build process.
