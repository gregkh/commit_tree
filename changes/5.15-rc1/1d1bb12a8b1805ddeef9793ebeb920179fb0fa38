rtc: Improve performance of rtc_time64_to_tm(). Add tests.

The current implementation of rtc_time64_to_tm() contains unnecessary
loops, branches and look-up tables. The new one uses an arithmetic-based
algorithm appeared in [1] and is approximately 4.3 times faster (YMMV).

The drawback is that the new code isn't intuitive and contains many 'magic
numbers' (not unusual for this type of algorithm). However, [1] justifies
all those numbers and, given this function's history, the code is unlikely
to need much maintenance, if any at all.

Add a KUnit test case that checks every day in a 160,000 years interval
starting on 1970-01-01 against the expected result. Add a new config
RTC_LIB_KUNIT_TEST symbol to give the option to run this test suite.
