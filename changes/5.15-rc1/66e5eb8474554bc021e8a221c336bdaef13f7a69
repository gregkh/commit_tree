bpf, tests: Add branch conversion JIT test

Some JITs may need to convert a conditional jump instruction to
to short PC-relative branch and a long unconditional jump, if the
PC-relative offset exceeds offset field width in the CPU instruction.
This test triggers such branch conversion on the 32-bit MIPS JIT.
