ARM: dts: omap4-l4-abe: Add McASP configuration

OMAP4 has a single McASP instance with single serializer and locked for DIT
mode.
To be able to enable the support the following fixes needed:
- Add the DAT port ranges to the target module's ranges

We can already fill in the op-mode and serial-dir  for McASP as it only
supports this configuration, but keep the module disabled as there is no
known device available where it is used.
