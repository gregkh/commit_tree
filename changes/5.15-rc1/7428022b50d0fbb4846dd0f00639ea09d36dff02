net: dsa: mt7530: fix VLAN traffic leaks again

When a port leaves a VLAN-aware bridge, the current code does not clear
other ports' matrix field bit. If the bridge is later set to VLAN-unaware
mode, traffic in the bridge may leak to that port.

Remove the VLAN filtering check in mt7530_port_bridge_leave.
