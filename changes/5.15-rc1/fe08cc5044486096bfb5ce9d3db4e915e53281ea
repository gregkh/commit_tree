xfs: open code sb verifier feature checks

The superblock verifiers are one of the last places that use the sb
version functions to do feature checks. This are all quite simple
uses, and there aren't many of them so open code them all.

Also, move the good version number check into xfs_sb.c instead of it
being an inline function in xfs_format.h
