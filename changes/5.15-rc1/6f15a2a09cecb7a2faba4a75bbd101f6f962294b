usb: bdc: Fix a resource leak in the error handling path of 'bdc_probe()'

If an error occurs after a successful 'clk_prepare_enable()' call, it must
be undone by a corresponding 'clk_disable_unprepare()' call.
This call is already present in the remove function.

Add this call in the error handling path and reorder the code so that the
'clk_prepare_enable()' call happens later in the function.
The goal is to have as much managed resources functions as possible
before the 'clk_prepare_enable()' call in order to keep the error handling
path simple.

While at it, remove the now unneeded 'clk' variable.
