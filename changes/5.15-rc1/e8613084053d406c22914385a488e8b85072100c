scsi: lpfc: Remove use of kmalloc() in trace event logging

There are instances when trace event logs are triggered from an interrupt
context. The trace event log may attempt to alloc memory causing scheduling
while atomic bug call traces.

Remove the need for the kmalloc'ed vport array when checking the
log_verbose flag, which eliminates the need for any allocation.
