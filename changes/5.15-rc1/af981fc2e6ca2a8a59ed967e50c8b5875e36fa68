media: ti-vpe: cal: remove wait when stopping camerarx

Asserting ComplexIO reset seems to affect the HW (ie. asserting reset
will break an active capture), but the RESET_DONE bit never changes to
"reset is ongoing" state. Thus we always get a timeout.

Drop the wait, as it seems to achieve nothing.
