ACPI: tables: FPDT: Do not print FW_BUG message if record types are reserved

In ACPI 6.4 spec, record types "0x0002-0xffff" of FPDT Performance Record
Types [1] and record types "0x0003-0xffff" of Runtime Performance Record
Types [2] are reserved.

Users might be confused with the FW_BUG message, and they think this
is the FW issue. Here is the example in a Lenovo box:

  ACPI: FPDT 0x00000000A820A000 000044 (v01 LENOVO THINKSYS 00000100 01000013)
  ACPI: Reserving FPDT table memory at [mem 0xa820a000-0xa820a043]
  ACPI FPDT: [Firmware Bug]: Invalid record 4113 found

So, remove the FW_BUG message to avoid confusion since those types are
reserved in ACPI 6.4 spec.
