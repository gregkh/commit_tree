bpf: selftest: Test batching and bpf_(get|set)sockopt in bpf tcp iter

This patch adds tests for the batching and bpf_(get|set)sockopt in
bpf tcp iter.

It first creates:
a) 1 non SO_REUSEPORT listener in lhash2.
b) 256 passive and active fds connected to the listener in (a).
c) 256 SO_REUSEPORT listeners in one of the lhash2 bucket.

The test sets all listeners and connections to bpf_cubic before
running the bpf iter.

The bpf iter then calls setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION) to switch
each listener and connection from bpf_cubic to bpf_dctcp.

The bpf iter has a random_retry mode such that it can return EAGAIN
to the usespace in the middle of a batch.
