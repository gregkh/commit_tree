sfc: falcon: Search VPD with pci_vpd_find_ro_info_keyword()

Use pci_vpd_find_ro_info_keyword() to search for keywords in VPD to
simplify the code.

Replace netif_err() with pci_err() because the netdevice isn't registered
yet, which results in very ugly messages.

Use kmemdup_nul() instead of open-coding it.

This is the same as 37838aa437c7 ("sfc: Search VPD with
pci_vpd_find_ro_info_keyword()"), just for the falcon chip version.
