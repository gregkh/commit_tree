selftests/bpf: Add test for xdp_md context in BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN

Add a test for using xdp_md as a context to BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN for XDP
programs.

The test uses a BPF program that takes in a return value from XDP
meta data, then reduces the size of the XDP meta data by 4 bytes.

Test cases validate the possible failure cases for passing in invalid
xdp_md contexts, that the return value is successfully passed
in, and that the adjusted meta data is successfully copied out.
