drm/i915/display/psr2: Mark as updated all planes that intersect with pipe_clip

Without this planes that were added by intel_psr2_sel_fetch_update()
that intersect with pipe damaged area will not
have skl_program_plane() and intel_psr2_program_plane_sel_fetch()
called, causing panel to not be properly updated.
