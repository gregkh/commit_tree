posix-cpu-timers: Assert task sighand is locked while starting cputime counter

Starting the process wide cputime counter needs to be done in the same
sighand locking sequence than actually arming the related timer otherwise
this races against concurrent timers setting/expiring in the same
threadgroup.

Detecting that the cputime counter is started without holding the sighand
lock is a first step toward debugging such situations.
