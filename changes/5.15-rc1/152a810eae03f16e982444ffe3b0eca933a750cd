phy: qcom-qmp: Add support for SM6115 UFS phy

Add the tables and constants for init sequences for UFS QMP phy found in
SM4250/6115 SoC. The phy is a variation of the v2 phy, but is mistakenly
labeled as v3-660 in downstream sources.

QSERDES COM, RX, TX registers match fully existing v2 registers, with
a few additions. PCS registers don't have much in common, but there are
no clashes with existing ones so new registers were added to existing v2
PCS pack.
