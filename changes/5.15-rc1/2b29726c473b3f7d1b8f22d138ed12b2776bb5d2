btrfs: rescue: allow ibadroots to skip bad extent tree when reading block group items

When extent tree gets corrupted, normally it's not extent tree root, but
one toasted tree leaf/node.

In that case, rescue=ibadroots mount option won't help as it can only
handle the extent tree root corruption.

This patch will enhance the behavior by:

- Allow fill_dummy_bgs() to ignore -EEXIST error

  This means we may have some block group items read from disk, but
  then hit some error halfway.

- Fallback to fill_dummy_bgs() if any error gets hit in
  btrfs_read_block_groups()

  Of course, this still needs rescue=ibadroots mount option.

With that, rescue=ibadroots can handle extent tree corruption more
gracefully and allow a better recover chance.
