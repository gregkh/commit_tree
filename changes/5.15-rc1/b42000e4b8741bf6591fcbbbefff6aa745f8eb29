firmware: qcom_scm: Allow qcom_scm driver to be loadable as a permenent module

Allow the qcom_scm driver to be loadable as a permenent module.

This still uses the "depends on QCOM_SCM || !QCOM_SCM" bit to
ensure that drivers that call into the qcom_scm driver are
also built as modules. While not ideal in some cases its the
only safe way I can find to avoid build errors without having
those drivers select QCOM_SCM and have to force it on (as
QCOM_SCM=n can be valid for those drivers).

Reviving this now that Saravana's fw_devlink defaults to on,
which should avoid loading troubles seen before.
