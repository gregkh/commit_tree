power: supply: bq24735: reorganize ChargeOption command macros

Rename ChargeOption macros to match the others for ChargeCurrent and
ChargeVoltage and also separate the command & masks macros from the bits of
interest macros for each command.  This macro doesn't introduce any
functional change, only code re-org.
