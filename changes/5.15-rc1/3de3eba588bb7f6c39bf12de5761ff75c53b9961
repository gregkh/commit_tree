ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: support adda in platform driver

This patch adds mt8195 adda dai driver.

audio_h clock is used by ADSP bus and ADDA module.
When ADDA requires audio_h clock, it is switched to APLL1, otherwise
it is switched to Xtal_26m so that APLL1 can be turned off when audio
feature is not used.
ADSP bus only requires that the clock is on, so dynamic reparenting
is used for the purpose of lowering power consumption.
