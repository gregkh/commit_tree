Bluetooth: hci_h5: add WAKEUP_DISABLE flag

Some RTL chips resets the FW on suspend, so wakeup is disabled on
those chips. This patch introduces this WAKEUP_DISABLE flag so that
chips that doesn't reset FW on suspend can leave the flag unset and
is allowed to wake the host.

This patch also left RTL8822 WAKEUP_DISABLE flag unset, therefore
allowing it to wake the host, and preventing reprobing on resume.
