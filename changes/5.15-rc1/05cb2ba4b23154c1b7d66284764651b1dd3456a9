can: c_can: rename IF_RX -> IF_NAPI

The C_CAN/D_CAN cores implement 2 interfaces to manage the message
objects. To avoid concurrency and the need for locking one interface
is used in the TX path (IF_TX). While the other one, named IF_RX is
used from NAPI context only. As this interface is not only used to
manage RX, but also TX message objects, this patch renames IF_RX to
IF_NAPI.
