connector: send event on write to /proc/[pid]/comm

While comm change event via prctl has been reported to proc connector by
'commit f786ecba4158 ("connector: add comm change event report to proc
connector")', connector listeners were missing comm changes by explicit
writes on /proc/[pid]/comm.

Let explicit writes on /proc/[pid]/comm report to proc connector.
