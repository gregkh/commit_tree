staging: rtl8192e: rtl_core: Fix possible null-pointer dereference in _rtl92e_pci_disconnect()

The variable dev is checked in:
  if (dev)

This indicates that it can be NULL. If so, a null-pointer dereference will
occur:
  priv = rtllib_priv(dev);

However, the value of priv is not used in the remaining part of this
function. Thus the else-branch can be removed to fix this posible
null-pointer dereference.
