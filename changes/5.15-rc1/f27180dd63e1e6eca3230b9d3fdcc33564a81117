asm-generic/uaccess.h: remove __strncpy_from_user/__strnlen_user

This is a preparation for changing over architectures to the
generic implementation one at a time. As there are no callers
of either __strncpy_from_user() or __strnlen_user(), fold these
into the strncpy_from_user() and strnlen_user() functions to make
each implementation independent of the others.

Many of these implementations have known bugs, but the intention
here is to not change behavior at all and stay compatible with
those bugs for the moment.
