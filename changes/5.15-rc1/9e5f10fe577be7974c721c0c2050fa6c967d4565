octeontx2-af: remove redudant second error check on variable err

A recent change added error checking messages and failed to remove one
of the previous error checks. There are now two checks on variable err
so the second one is redundant dead code and can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Logically dead code")
Fixes: a83bdada06bf ("octeontx2-af: Add debug messages for failures")
