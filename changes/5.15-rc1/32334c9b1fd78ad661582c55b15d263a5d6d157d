drm/i915/gtt: ignore min_page_size for paging structures

The min_page_size is only needed for pages inserted into the GTT, and
for our paging structures we only need at most 4K bytes, so simply
ignore the min_page_size restrictions here, otherwise we might see some
severe overallocation on some devices.
