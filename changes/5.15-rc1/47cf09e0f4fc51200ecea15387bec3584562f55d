thermal/drivers/rcar_gen3_thermal: Add support for hardware trip points

All supported hardware except V3U is capable of generating interrupts
to the CPU when the temperature go below or above a set value. Use this
to implement support for the set_trip() feature of the thermal core on
supported hardware.

The V3U have its interrupts routed to the ECM module and therefore can
not be used to implement set_trip() as the driver can't be made aware of
when the interrupt triggers.

Each TSC is capable of tracking up-to three different temperatures while
only two are needed to implement the tracking of the thermal window.
