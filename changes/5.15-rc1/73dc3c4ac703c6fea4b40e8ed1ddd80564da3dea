scsi: ufs: Retry aborted SCSI commands instead of completing these successfully

Neither SAM nor the UFS standard require that the UFS controller fills in
the completion status of commands that have been aborted (LUN RESET aborts
pending commands). Hence do not rely on the completion status provided by
the UFS controller for aborted commands but instead ask the SCSI core to
retry SCSI commands that have been aborted.
