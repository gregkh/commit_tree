pinctrl: renesas: r8a77995: Add bias pinconf support

Implement support for pull-up (most pins, excl. DU_DOTCLKIN0) and
pull-down (most pins, excl. JTAG) handling for the R-Car D3 SoC, using
some parts from the common R-Car bias handling, which requires making
rcar_pin_to_bias_reg() public.

R-Car D3 needs special handling for the NFRE# (GP_3_0) and NFWE#
(GP_3_1) pins.  Unlike all other pins, they are controlled by different
bits in the LSI pin pull-up/down control register (PUD2) than in the LSI
pin pull-enable register (PUEN2).
