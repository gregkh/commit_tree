HID: amd_sfh: Add command response to check command status

Sometimes sensor enable/disable may take time, without checking the
actual status bits from MP2 FW can lead the amd-sfh to misbehave.

Hence add a status check of enable/disable command
by waiting on the command response before sending the next
command to FW.
