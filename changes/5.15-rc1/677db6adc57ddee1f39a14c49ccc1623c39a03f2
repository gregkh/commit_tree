drm/i915/gem: Set the watchdog timeout directly in intel_context_set_gem (v2)

Instead of handling it like a context param, unconditionally set it when
intel_contexts are created.  For years we've had the idea of a watchdog
uAPI floating about. The aim was for media, so that they could set very
tight deadlines for their transcodes jobs, so that if you have a corrupt
bitstream (especially for decoding) you don't hang your desktop too
hard.  But it's been stuck in limbo since forever, and this simplifies
things a bit in preparation for the proto-context work.  If we decide to
actually make said uAPI a reality, we can do it through the proto-
context easily enough.

This does mean that we move from reading the request_timeout_ms param
once per engine when engines are created instead of once at context
creation.  If someone changes request_timeout_ms between creating a
context and setting engines, it will mean that they get the new timeout.
If someone races setting request_timeout_ms and context creation, they
can theoretically end up with different timeouts.  However, since both
of these are fairly harmless and require changing kernel params, we
don't care.

v2 (Tvrtko Ursulin):
 - Add a comment about races with request_timeout_ms
