media: imx258: Rectify mismatch of VTS value

The frame_length_lines (0x0340) registers are hard-coded as follows:

- 4208x3118
  frame_length_lines = 0x0c50

- 2104x1560
  frame_length_lines = 0x0638

- 1048x780
  frame_length_lines = 0x034c

The driver exposes the V4L2_CID_VBLANK control in read-only mode and
sets its value to vts_def - height, where vts_def is a mode-dependent
value coming from the supported_modes array. It is set using one of
the following macros defined in the driver:

  #define IMX258_VTS_30FPS                0x0c98
  #define IMX258_VTS_30FPS_2K             0x0638
  #define IMX258_VTS_30FPS_VGA            0x034c

There's a clear mismatch in the value for the full resolution mode i.e.
IMX258_VTS_30FPS. Fix it by rectifying the macro with the value set for
the frame_length_lines register as stated above.
