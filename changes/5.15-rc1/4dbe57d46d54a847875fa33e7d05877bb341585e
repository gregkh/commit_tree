scsi: qedi: Fix error codes in qedi_alloc_global_queues()

This function had some left over code that returned 1 on error instead
negative error codes.  Convert everything to use negative error codes.  The
caller treats all non-zero returns the same so this does not affect run
time.

A couple places set "rc" instead of "status" so those error paths ended up
returning success by mistake.  Get rid of the "rc" variable and use
"status" everywhere.

Remove the bogus "status = 0" initialization, as a future proofing measure
so the compiler will warn about uninitialized error codes.
