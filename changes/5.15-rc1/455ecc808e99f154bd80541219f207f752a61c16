ASoC: qdsp6: q6adm: fix cppcheck warnings for unnecessary initialization

cppcheck reports below warning.

q6adm.c:475]: (style) Variable 'matrix_map' is reassigned a value before the
old one has been used.

This is due to unnecessary initialization of variable matrix_map, which is
now removed as part of this patch.
