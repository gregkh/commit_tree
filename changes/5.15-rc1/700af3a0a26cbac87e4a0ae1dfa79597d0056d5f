dmaengine: idxd: add 'struct idxd_dev' as wrapper for conf_dev

Add a 'struct idxd_dev' that wraps the 'struct device' for idxd conf_dev
that registers with the dsa bus. This is introduced in order to deal with
multiple different types of 'devices' that are registered on the dsa_bus
when the compat driver needs to route them to the correct driver to attach.
The bind() call now can determine the type of device and then do the
appropriate driver matching.
