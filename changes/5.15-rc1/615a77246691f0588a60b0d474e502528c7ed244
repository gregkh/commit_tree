drm/i915/dg1: Adjust the AUDIO power domain

DG1 and XE_PLD platforms has Audio MMIO/VERBS lies in PG0 power
well. Adjusting the power domain accordingly to
POWER_DOMAIN_AUDIO_MMIO for audio detection and
POWER_DOMAIN_AUDIO_PLAYBACK for audio playback.

While doing this it requires to use POWER_DOMAIN_AUDIO_MMIO
power domain instead of POWER_DOMAIN_AUDIO in crtc power domain mask
and POWER_DOMAIN_AUDIO_PLAYBACK with intel_display_power_{get, put}
to enable/disable display audio codec power.

It will save the power in use cases when DP/HDMI connectors
configured with PIPE_A without any audio playback.
