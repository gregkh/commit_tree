KVM: Move last_used_slot logic out of search_memslots

Make search_memslots unconditionally search all memslots and move the
last_used_slot logic up one level to __gfn_to_memslot. This is in
preparation for introducing a per-vCPU last_used_slot.

As part of this change convert existing callers of search_memslots to
__gfn_to_memslot to avoid making any functional changes.
