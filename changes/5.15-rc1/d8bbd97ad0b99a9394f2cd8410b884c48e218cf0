locking/local_lock: Add missing owner initialization

If CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y is enabled then local_lock_t has an 'owner'
member which is checked for consistency, but nothing initialized it to
zero explicitly.

The static initializer does so implicit, and the run time allocated per CPU
storage is usually zero initialized as well, but relying on that is not
really good practice.
