drm/i915/guc: Fix for error capture after full GPU reset with GuC

In the case of a full GPU reset (e.g. because GuC has died or because
GuC's hang detection has been disabled), the driver can't rely on GuC
reporting the guilty context. Instead, the driver needs to scan all
active contexts and find one that is currently executing, as per the
execlist mode behaviour. In GuC mode, this scan is different to
execlist mode as the active request list is handled very differently.

Similarly, the request state dump in debugfs needs to be handled
differently when in GuC submission mode.

Also refactured some of the request scanning code to avoid duplication
across the multiple code paths that are now replicating it.
