clk: renesas: Make CLK_R9A06G032 invisible

When configuring a kernel including support for Renesas ARM/ARM64 Socs,
but excluding support for the RZ/N1D SoC, the user is always asked about
the RZ/N1D clock driver.  As this driver is already auto-selected when
building a kernel including support for the RZ/N1D SoC, there is no need
to make the CLK_R9A06G032 symbol visible, unless compile-testing.

Align the symbol description with the other symbols.
