net/ipv4: Revert use of struct_size() helper

Revert the use of structr_size() and stay with IP_MSFILTER_SIZE() for
now, as in this case, the size of struct ip_msfilter didn't change with
the addition of the flexible array imsf_slist_flex[]. So, if we use
struct_size() we will be allocating and calculating the size of
struct ip_msfilter with one too many items for imsf_slist_flex[].

We might use struct_size() in the future, but for now let's stay
with IP_MSFILTER_SIZE().
