s390/hwcaps: open code initialization of first six hwcap bits

The first six hwcap bits are initialized in a rather odd way: an array
contains the stfl(e) bits which need to be set, so that the
corresponding bit position (= array index) within hwcaps are set.

Better open code it like it is done for all other bits, making it
obvious which bit is set when.
