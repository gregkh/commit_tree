cxl/acpi: Do not add DSDT disabled ACPI0016 host bridge ports

During CXL ACPI probe, host bridge ports are discovered by scanning
the ACPI0017 root port for ACPI0016 host bridge devices. The scan
matches on the hardware id of "ACPI0016". An issue occurs when an
ACPI0016 device is defined in the DSDT yet disabled on the platform.
Attempts by the cxl_acpi driver to add host bridge ports using a
disabled device fails, and the entire cxl_acpi probe fails.

The DSDT table includes an _STA method that sets the status and the
ACPI subsystem has checks available to examine it. One such check is
in the acpi_pci_find_root() path. Move the call to acpi_pci_find_root()
to the matching function to prevent this issue when adding either
upstream or downstream ports.
