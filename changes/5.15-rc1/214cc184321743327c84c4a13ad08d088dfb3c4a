btrfs: constify and cleanup variables in comparators

Comparators just read the data and thus get const parameters. This
should be also preserved by the local variables, update all comparators
passed to sort or bsearch.

Cleanups:

- unnecessary casts are dropped
- btrfs_cmp_device_free_bytes is cleaned up to follow the common pattern
  and 'inline' is dropped as the function address is taken
