net: bridge: fix build when setting skb->offload_fwd_mark with CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV=n

Switchdev support can be disabled at compile time, and in that case,
struct sk_buff will not contain the offload_fwd_mark field.

To make the code in br_forward.c work in both cases, we do what is done
in other places and we create a helper function, with an empty shim
definition, that is implemented by the br_switchdev.o translation module.
This is always compiled if and only if CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV is y or m.
