scripts/Makefile.clang: default to LLVM_IAS=1

LLVM_IAS=1 controls enabling clang's integrated assembler via
-integrated-as. This was an explicit opt in until we could enable
assembler support in Clang for more architecures. Now we have support
and CI coverage of LLVM_IAS=1 for all architecures except a few more
bugs affecting s390 and powerpc.

This commit flips the default from opt in via LLVM_IAS=1 to opt out via
LLVM_IAS=0.  CI systems or developers that were previously doing builds
with CC=clang or LLVM=1 without explicitly setting LLVM_IAS must now
explicitly opt out via LLVM_IAS=0, otherwise they will be implicitly
opted-in.

This finally shortens the command line invocation when cross compiling
with LLVM to simply:

$ make ARCH=arm64 LLVM=1
