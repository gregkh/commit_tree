habanalabs: add support for encapsulated signals reservation

The signaling from within encapsulated OP capability is merged into the
existing stream architecture, such that one can trigger multiple
signaling from an encapsulated op, according to the time the event
was done in the graph execution and avoid the need to wait for the
whole encapsulated OP execution to be complete before the stream can
signal.

This commit implements only the reserve/unreserve part.
