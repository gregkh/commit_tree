video: fbdev: ssd1307fb: Optimize screen updates

Currently, each screen update triggers an I2C transfer of all screen
data, up to 1 KiB of data for a 128x64 display, which takes at least 20
ms in Fast mode.

Reduce the amount of transferred data by only updating the rectangle
that changed.  Remove the calls to ssd1307fb_set_col_range() and
ssd1307fb_set_page_range() during initialization, as
ssd1307fb_update_rect() now takes care of that.

Note that for now the optimized operation is only used for fillrect,
copyarea, and imageblit, which are used by fbcon.
