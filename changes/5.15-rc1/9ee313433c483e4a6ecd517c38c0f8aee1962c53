ice: restart periodic outputs around time changes

When we enabled auxiliary input/output support for the E810 device, we
forgot to add logic to restart the output when we change time. This is
important as the periodic output will be incorrect after a time change
otherwise.

This unfortunately includes the adjust time function, even though it
uses an atomic hardware interface. The atomic adjustment can still cause
the pin output to stall permanently, so we need to stop and restart it.

Introduce wrapper functions to temporarily disable and then re-enable
the clock outputs.
