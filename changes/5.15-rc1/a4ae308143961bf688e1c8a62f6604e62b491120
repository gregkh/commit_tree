SUNRPC: Move client-side disconnect injection

Disconnect injection stress-tests the ability for both client and
server implementations to behave resiliently in the face of network
instability.

Convert the existing client-side disconnect injection infrastructure
to use the kernel's generic error injection facility. The generic
facility has a richer set of injection criteria.
