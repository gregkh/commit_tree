staging: rtl8723bs: use MAX_RF_PATH_NUM as ceiling to rf path index

use MAX_RF_PATH_NUM as ceiling to rf path index.
Only 2 rf paths are used, not 4. Remove also
TX_POWER_BY_RATE_NUM_RF left unused.

Use RF_PATH_A as loop starting point instead of
hardcoded 0, as in other places.

Related comments modified accordingly.
