hrtimer: Ensure timerfd notification for HIGHRES=n

If high resolution timers are disabled the timerfd notification about a
clock was set event is not happening for all cases which use
clock_was_set_delayed() because that's a NOP for HIGHRES=n, which is wrong.

Make clock_was_set_delayed() unconditially available to fix that.
