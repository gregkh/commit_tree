drm/i915/xehp: VDBOX/VEBOX fusing registers are enable-based

On Xe_HP the fusing register is renamed and changed to have the "enable"
semantics, but otherwise remains compatible (mmio address, bitmask
ranges) with older platforms.

To simplify things we do not add a new register definition but just stop
inverting the fusing masks before processing them.
