scsi: target: Allows backend drivers to fail with specific sense codes

Currently, backend drivers can fail I/O with SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION which
gets us TCM_LOGICAL_UNIT_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE.

Add a new helper that allows backend drivers to fail with specific sense
codes.

This is based on a patch from Mike Christie <michael.christie@oracle.com>.
