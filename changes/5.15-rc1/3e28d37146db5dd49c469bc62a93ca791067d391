drm/i915: Move priolist to new i915_sched_engine object

Introduce i915_sched_engine object which is lower level data structure
that i915_scheduler / generic code can operate on without touching
execlist specific structures. This allows additional submission backends
to be added without breaking the layering. Currently the execlists
backend uses 1 of these object per each engine (physical or virtual) but
future backends like the GuC will point to less instances utilizing the
reference counting.

This is a bit of detour to integrating the i915 with the DRM scheduler
but this object will still exist when the DRM scheduler lands in the
i915. It will however look a bit different. It will encapsulate the
drm_gpu_scheduler object plus and common variables (to the backends)
related to scheduling. Regardless this is a step in the right direction.

This patch starts the aforementioned transition by moving the priolist
into the i915_sched_engine object.
