habanalabs: fix race between soft reset and heartbeat

There is a scenario where an ongoing soft reset would race with an

thus to escalate into a hard reset.

With this fix, soft-reset procedure will disable heartbeat CPU messages
and flush the (ongoing) current one before continuing with reset code.
