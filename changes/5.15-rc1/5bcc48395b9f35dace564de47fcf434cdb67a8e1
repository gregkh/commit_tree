drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Attach to next bridge if available

On all platforms except i.MX and Rockchip, the dw-hdmi DT bindings
require a video output port connected to an HDMI sink (most likely an
HDMI connector, in rare cases another bridges converting HDMI to another
protocol). For those platforms, retrieve the next bridge and attach it
from the dw-hdmi bridge attach handler.
