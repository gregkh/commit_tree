printk: convert @syslog_lock to mutex

@syslog_lock was a raw_spin_lock to simplify the transition of
removing @logbuf_lock and the safe buffers. With that transition
complete, and since all uses of @syslog_lock are within sleepable
contexts, @syslog_lock can become a mutex.

Note that until now register_console() would disable interrupts
using irqsave, which implies that it may be called with interrupts
disabled. And indeed, there is one possible call chain on parisc
where this happens:

handle_interruption(code=1) /* High-priority machine check (HPMC) */
  pdc_console_restart()
    pdc_console_init_force()
      register_console()

However, register_console() calls console_lock(), which might sleep.
So it has never been allowed to call register_console() from an
atomic context and the above call chain is a bug.

Note that the removal of read_syslog_seq_irq() is slightly changing
the behavior of SYSLOG_ACTION_READ by testing against a possibly
outdated @seq value. However, the value of @seq could have changed
after the test, so it is not a new window. A follow-up commit closes
this window.
