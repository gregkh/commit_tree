i2c: virtio: add a virtio i2c frontend driver

Add an I2C bus driver for virtio para-virtualization.

The controller can be emulated by the backend driver in
any device model software by following the virtio protocol.

The device specification can be found on
https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/virtio-comment/202101/msg00008.html.

By following the specification, people may implement different
backend drivers to emulate different controllers according to
their needs.
