futex: Avoid redundant task lookup

No need to do the full VPID based task lookup and validation of the top
waiter when the user space futex was acquired on it's behalf during the
requeue_pi operation. The task is known already and it cannot go away
before requeue_pi_wake_futex() has been invoked.

Split out the actual attach code from attach_pi_state_owner() and use that
instead of the full blown variant.
