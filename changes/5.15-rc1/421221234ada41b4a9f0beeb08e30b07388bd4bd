KVM: x86: Open code necessary bits of kvm_lapic_set_base() at vCPU RESET

Stuff vcpu->arch.apic_base and apic->base_address directly during APIC
reset, as opposed to bouncing through kvm_set_apic_base() while fudging
the ENABLE bit during creation to avoid the other, unwanted side effects.

This is a step towards consolidating the APIC RESET logic across x86,
VMX, and SVM.
