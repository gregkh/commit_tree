drm/i915/guc: Support request cancellation

This adds GuC backend support for i915_request_cancel(), which in turn
makes CONFIG_DRM_I915_REQUEST_TIMEOUT work.

This implementation makes use of fence while there are likely simplier
options. A fence was chosen because of another feature coming soon
which requires a user to block on a context until scheduling is
disabled. In that case we return the fence to the user and the user can
wait on that fence.

v2:
 (Daniele)
  - A comment about locking the blocked incr / decr
  - A comments about the use of the fence
  - Update commit message explaining why fence
  - Delete redundant check blocked count in unblock function
  - Ring buffer implementation
  - Comment about blocked in submission path
  - Shorter rpm path
v3:
 (Checkpatch)
  - Fix typos in commit message
 (Daniel)
  - Rework to simplier locking structure in guc_context_block / unblock
