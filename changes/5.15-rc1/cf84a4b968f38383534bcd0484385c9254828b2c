dmaengine: idxd: remove interrupt disable for dev_lock

The spinlock is not being used in hard interrupt context. There is no need
to disable irq when acquiring the lock. The interrupt thread handler also
is not in bottom half context, therefore we can also remove disabling of
the bh. Convert all dev_lock acquisition to plain spin_lock() calls.
