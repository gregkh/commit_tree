iwlwifi: mvm: Refactor setting of SSIDs for 6GHz scan

- Short SSIDs should always be added for direct SSIDs included
  in the scan request. However, this was not done in case that
  information for collocated APs was included. Fix this.
- With the above fix, if the FW also supports discovery of hidden
  APs over the 6GHz band, also set the corresponding full SSID
  information.
