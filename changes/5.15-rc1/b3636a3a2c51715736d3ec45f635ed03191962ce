PM: runtime: add devm_pm_runtime_enable helper

A typical code pattern for pm_runtime_enable() call is to call it in the
_probe function and to call pm_runtime_disable() both from _probe error
path and from _remove function. For some drivers the whole remove
function would consist of the call to pm_remove_disable().

Add helper function to replace this bolierplate piece of code. Calling
devm_pm_runtime_enable() removes the need for calling
pm_runtime_disable() both in the probe()'s error path and in the
remove() function.
