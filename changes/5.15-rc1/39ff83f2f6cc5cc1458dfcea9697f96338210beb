time: Handle negative seconds correctly in timespec64_to_ns()

timespec64_ns() prevents multiplication overflows by comparing the seconds
value of the timespec to KTIME_SEC_MAX. If the value is greater or equal it
returns KTIME_MAX.

But that check casts the signed seconds value to unsigned which makes the
comparision true for all negative values and therefore return wrongly
KTIME_MAX.

Negative second values are perfectly valid and required in some places,
e.g. ptp_clock_adjtime().

Remove the cast and add a check for the negative boundary which is required
to prevent undefined behaviour due to multiplication underflow.
