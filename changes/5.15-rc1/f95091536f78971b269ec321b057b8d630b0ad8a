sched/deadline: Fix reset_on_fork reporting of DL tasks

It is possible for sched_getattr() to incorrectly report the state of
the reset_on_fork flag when called on a deadline task.

Indeed, if the flag was set on a deadline task using sched_setattr()
with flags (SCHED_FLAG_RESET_ON_FORK | SCHED_FLAG_KEEP_PARAMS), then
p->sched_reset_on_fork will be set, but __setscheduler() will bail out
early, which means that the dl_se->flags will not get updated by
__setscheduler_params()->__setparam_dl(). Consequently, if
sched_getattr() is then called on the task, __getparam_dl() will
override kattr.sched_flags with the now out-of-date copy in dl_se->flags
and report the stale value to userspace.

To fix this, make sure to only copy the flags that are relevant to
sched_deadline to and from the dl_se->flags field.
