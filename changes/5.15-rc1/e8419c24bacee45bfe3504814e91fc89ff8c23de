firmware: arm_scmi: Make SCMI transports configurable

Add configuration options to be able to select which SCMI transports have
to be compiled into the SCMI stack.

Mailbox and SMC are by default enabled if their related dependencies are
satisfied.

While doing that move all SCMI related config options in their own
dedicated submenu.
