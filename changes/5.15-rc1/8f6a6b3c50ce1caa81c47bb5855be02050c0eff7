PCI: hv: Support for create interrupt v3

Hyper-V vPCI protocol version 1_4 adds support for create interrupt
v3. Create interrupt v3 essentially makes the size of the vector
field bigger in the message, thereby allowing bigger vector values.
For example, that will come into play for supporting LPI vectors
on ARM, which start at 8192.
