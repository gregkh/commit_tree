net: ipa: kill IPA clock reference count

The runtime power management core code maintains a usage count.  This
count mirrors the IPA clock reference count, and there's no need to
maintain both.  So get rid of the IPA clock reference count and just
rely on the runtime PM usage count to determine when the hardware
should be suspended or resumed.

Use pm_runtime_get_if_active() in ipa_clock_get_additional().  We
care whether power is active, regardless of whether it's in use, so
pass true for its ign_usage_count argument.

The IPA clock mutex is just used to make enabling/disabling the
clock and updating the reference count occur atomically.  Without
the reference count, there's no need for the mutex, so get rid of
that too.
