scsi: qedf: Fix error codes in qedf_alloc_global_queues()

This driver has some left over "return 1" on failure style code mixed with
"return negative error codes" style code.  The caller doesn't care so we
should just convert everything to return negative error codes.

Then there was a problem that there were two variables used to store error
codes which just resulted in confusion.  If qedf_alloc_bdq() returned a
negative error code, we accidentally returned success instead of
propagating the error code.  So get rid of the "rc" variable and use
"status" every where.

Also remove the "status = 0" initialization so that these sorts of bugs
will be detected by the compiler in the future.
