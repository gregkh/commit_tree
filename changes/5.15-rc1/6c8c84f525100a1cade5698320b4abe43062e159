svcrdma: Fewer calls to wake_up() in Send completion handler

Because wake_up() takes an IRQ-safe lock, it can be expensive,
especially to call inside of a single-threaded completion handler.
What's more, the Send wait queue almost never has waiters, so
most of the time, this is an expensive no-op.

As always, the goal is to reduce the average overhead of each
completion, because a transport's completion handlers are single-
threaded on one CPU core. This change reduces CPU utilization of
the Send completion thread by 2-3% on my server.
