can: dev: provide optional GPIO based termination support

For CAN buses to work, a termination resistor has to be present at both
ends of the bus. This resistor is usually 120 Ohms, other values may be
required for special bus topologies.

This patch adds support for a generic GPIO based CAN termination. The
resistor value has to be specified via device tree, and it can only be
attached to or detached from the bus. By default the termination is not
active.
