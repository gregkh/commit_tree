s390: rename dma section to amode31

The dma section name is confusing, since the code which resides within
that section has nothing to do with direct memory access.  Instead the
limitation is that the code has to run in 31 bit addressing mode, and
therefore has to reside below 2GB.  So the name was chosen since
ZONE_DMA is the same region.

To reduce confusion rename the section to amode31, which hopefully
describes better what this is about.

Note: this will also change vmcoreinfo strings
- SDMA=... gets renamed to SAMODE31=...
- EDMA=... gets renamed to EAMODE31=...
