firmware: smccc: Register smccc_trng platform device

At the moment we probe for the Random Number Generator SMCCC service,
and use that in the core code (arch_get_random). However the hardware
entropy can also be useful to access from userland, and be it to assess
its quality.

Register a platform device when the SMCCC TRNG service is detected, to
allow a hw_random driver to hook onto this.

The function registering the device is deliberately made in a way which
allows expansion, so other services that could be exposed via a platform
device (or some other interface), can be added here easily.
