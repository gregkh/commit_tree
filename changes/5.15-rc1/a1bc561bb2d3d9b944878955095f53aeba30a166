mm: sparse: pass section_nr to section_mark_present

Patch series "mm: sparse: remove __section_nr() function", v4.

This patch (of 3):

With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME enabled, __section_nr() which converts
mem_section to section_nr could be costly since it iterates all section
roots to check if the given mem_section is in its range.

Since both callers of section_mark_present already know section_nr, let's
also pass section_nr as well as mem_section in order to reduce costly
translation.
