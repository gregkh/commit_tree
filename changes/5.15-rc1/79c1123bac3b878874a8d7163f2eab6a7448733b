ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add support for a second headset mic input

Some devices (HP Elitepad 1000 G2) have 2 headset jacks (1 on the dock,
2nd on the tablet itself). The 2nd headset mic input on these is
connected to in1 (the internal mics on the HP Elitepad 1000 G2 use DMIC2).

Add support for this through a new BYT_RT5640_HSMIC2_ON_IN1 quirk.
