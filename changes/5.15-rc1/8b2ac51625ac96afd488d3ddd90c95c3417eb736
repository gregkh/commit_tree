iio: hid-sensors: bind IIO channels alloc to device object

Some HID drivers use devm_kmemdup() already to clone the template IIO
channels information and update it.
However, there are still some drivers that kmemdup() and kfree() the
channels.

This change converts them to use devm_kmemdup() and bind the life-time of
this allocated object to the parent device object (in these drivers).
