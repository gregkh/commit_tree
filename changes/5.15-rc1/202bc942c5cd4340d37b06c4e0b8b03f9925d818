block: Introduce IOPRIO_NR_LEVELS

The BFQ scheduler and ioprio_check_cap() both assume that the RT
priority class (IOPRIO_CLASS_RT) can have up to 8 different priority
levels, similarly to the BE class (IOPRIO_CLASS_iBE). This is
controlled using the IOPRIO_BE_NR macro , which is badly named as the
number of levels also applies to the RT class.

Introduce the class independent IOPRIO_NR_LEVELS macro, defined to 8,
to make things clear. Keep the old IOPRIO_BE_NR macro definition as an
alias for IOPRIO_NR_LEVELS.
