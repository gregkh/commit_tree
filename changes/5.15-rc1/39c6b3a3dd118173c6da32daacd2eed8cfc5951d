of: fdt: Remove weak early_init_dt_mark_hotplug_memory_arch()

Commit 41a9ada3e6b4253f ("of/fdt: mark hotpluggable memory") introduced
two (for systems with and without memblock) weak versions of
early_init_dt_mark_hotplug_memory_arch(), that could be overridden by an
architecture-specific version.  However, no overrides ever emerged.
Later, commit aca52c3983891060 ("mm: remove CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK")
removed the non-memblock version.

Remove early_init_dt_mark_hotplug_memory_arch(), and replace it by a
direct call to memblock_mark_hotplug().
