scsi: lpfc: Discovery state machine fixes for LOGO handling

If a LOGO is received for a node that is in the NPR state, post a DEVICE_RM
event to allow clean up of the logged out node.

Clearing the NLP_NPR_2B_DISC flag upon receipt of a LOGO ACC may cause
skipping of processing outstanding PLOGIs triggered by parallel RSCN
events.  If an outstanding PLOGI is being retried and receipt of a LOGO ACC
occurs, then allow the discovery state machine's PLOGI completion to clean
up the node.
