lib/scatterlist: Provide a dedicated function to support table append

RDMA is the only in-kernel user that uses __sg_alloc_table_from_pages to
append pages dynamically. In the next patch. That mode will be extended
and that function will get more parameters. So separate it into a unique
function to make such change more clear.
