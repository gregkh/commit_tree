net: dsa: use switchdev_handle_fdb_{add,del}_to_device

Using the new fan-out helper for FDB entries installed on the software
bridge, we can install host addresses with the proper refcount on the
CPU port, such that this case:

ip link set swp0 master br0
ip link set swp1 master br0
ip link set swp2 master br0
ip link set swp3 master br0
ip link set br0 address 00:01:02:03:04:05
ip link set swp3 nomaster

works properly and the br0 address remains installed as a host entry
with refcount 3 instead of getting deleted.
