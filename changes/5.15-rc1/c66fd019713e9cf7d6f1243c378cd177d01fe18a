block: make the block holder code optional

Move the block holder code into a separate file as it is not in any way
related to the other block_dev.c code, and add a new selectable config
option for it so that we don't have to build it without any remapped
drivers selected.

The Kconfig symbol contains a _DEPRECATED suffix to match the comments
added in commit 49731baa41df
("block: restore multiple bd_link_disk_holder() support").
