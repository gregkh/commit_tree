brcmfmac: firmware: Fix firmware loading

The patch that would first try the board-specific firmware
had a bug because the fallback would not be called: the
asynchronous interface is used meaning request_firmware_nowait()
returns 0 immediately.

Harden the firmware loading like this:

- If we cannot build an alt_path (like if no board_type is
  specified) just request the first firmware without any
  suffix, like in the past.

- If the lookup of a board specific firmware fails, we get
  a NULL fw in the async callback, so just try again without
  the alt_path from a dedicated brcm_fw_request_done_alt_path
  callback.

- Drop the unnecessary prototype of brcm_fw_request_done.

- Added MODULE_FIRMWARE match for per-board SDIO bins, making
  userspace tools to pull all the relevant firmware files.
