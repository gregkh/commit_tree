IMA: add support to restrict the hash algorithms used for file appraisal

The kernel accepts any hash algorithm as a value for the security.ima
xattr. Users may wish to restrict the accepted algorithms to only
support strong cryptographic ones.

Provide the plumbing to restrict the permitted set of hash algorithms
used for verifying file hashes and signatures stored in security.ima
xattr.
