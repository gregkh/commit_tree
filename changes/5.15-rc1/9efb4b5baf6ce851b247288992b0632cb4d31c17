net: optimize GRO for the common case.

After the previous patches, at GRO time, skb->slow_gro is
usually 0, unless the packets comes from some H/W offload
slowpath or tunnel.

We can optimize the GRO code assuming !skb->slow_gro is likely.
This remove multiple conditionals in the most common path, at the
price of an additional one when we hit the above "slow-paths".
