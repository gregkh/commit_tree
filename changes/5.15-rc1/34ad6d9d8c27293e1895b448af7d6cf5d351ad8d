bpf, samples: Add missing mprog-disable to xdp_redirect_cpu's optstring

Commit ce4dade7f12a ("samples/bpf: xdp_redirect_cpu: Load a eBPF program
on cpumap") added the following option, but missed adding it to optstring:

  - mprog-disable: disable loading XDP program on cpumap entries

Fix it and add the missing option character.
