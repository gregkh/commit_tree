io_uring: optimise putting task struct

We cache all the reference to task + tctx, so if io_put_task() is
called by the corresponding task itself, we can save on atomics and
return the refs right back into the cache.

It's beneficial for all inline completions, and also iopolling, when
polling and submissions are done by the same task, including
SQPOLL|IOPOLL.

Note: io_uring_cancel_generic() can return refs to the cache as well,
so those should be flushed in the loop for tctx_inflight() to work
right.
