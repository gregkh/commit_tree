m68k: remove legacy probing

There are six m68k specific drivers that use the legacy probe method
in drivers/net/Space.c. However, all of these only support a single
device, and they completely ignore the command line settings from
netdev_boot_setup_check, so there is really no point at all.

Aside from sun3_82586, these already have a module_init function that
can be used for built-in mode as well, simply by removing the #ifdef.

Note that the 82596 driver was previously used on ISA as well, but
that got dropped long ago.
