btrfs: zoned: fix ordered extent boundary calculation

btrfs_lookup_ordered_extent() is supposed to query the offset in a file
instead of the logical address. Pass the file offset from
submit_extent_page() to calc_bio_boundaries().

Also, calc_bio_boundaries() relies on the bio's operation flag, so move
the call site after setting it.

Fixes: 390ed29b817e ("btrfs: refactor submit_extent_page() to make bio and its flag tracing easier")
