KVM: SVM: Add 5-level page table support for SVM

When the 5-level page table is enabled on host OS, the nested page table
for guest VMs must use 5-level as well. Update get_npt_level() function
to reflect this requirement. In the meanwhile, remove the code that
prevents kvm-amd driver from being loaded when 5-level page table is
detected.
