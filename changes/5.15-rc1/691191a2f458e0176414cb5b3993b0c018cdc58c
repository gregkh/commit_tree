drm/amd/amdgpu:flush ttm delayed work before cancel_sync

[Why]
In some cases when we unload driver, warning call trace
will show up in vram_mgr_fini which claims that LRU is not empty, caused
by the ttm bo inside delay deleted queue.

[How]
We should flush delayed work to make sure the delay deleting is done.
