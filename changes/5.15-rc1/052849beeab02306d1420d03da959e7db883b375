fs: dlm: clear CF_APP_LIMITED on close

If send_to_sock() sets CF_APP_LIMITED limited bit and it has not been
cleared by a waiting lowcomms_write_space() yet and a close_connection()
apprears we should clear the CF_APP_LIMITED bit again because the
connection starts from a new state again at reconnect.
