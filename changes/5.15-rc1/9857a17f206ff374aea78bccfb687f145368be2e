mm/gup: remove try_get_page(), call try_get_compound_head() directly

try_get_page() is very similar to try_get_compound_head(), and in fact
try_get_page() has fallen a little behind in terms of maintenance:
try_get_compound_head() handles speculative page references more
thoroughly.

There are only two try_get_page() callsites, so just call
try_get_compound_head() directly from those, and remove try_get_page()
entirely.

Also, seeing as how this changes try_get_compound_head() into a non-static
function, provide some kerneldoc documentation for it.
