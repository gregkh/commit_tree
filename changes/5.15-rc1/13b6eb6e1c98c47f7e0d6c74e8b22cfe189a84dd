iommu: Streamline iommu_iova_to_phys()

If people are going to insist on calling iommu_iova_to_phys()
pointlessly and expecting it to work, we can at least do ourselves a
favour by handling those cases in the core code, rather than repeatedly
across an inconsistent handful of drivers.

Since all the existing drivers implement the internal callback, and any
future ones are likely to want to work with iommu-dma which relies on
iova_to_phys a fair bit, we may as well remove that currently-redundant
check as well and consider it mandatory.
