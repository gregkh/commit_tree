ACPI: CPPC: Introduce cppc_get_nominal_perf()

On some systems the nominal_perf value retrieved via CPPC is just
a constant and fetching it doesn't require accessing any registers,
so if it is the only CPPC capability that's needed, it is wasteful
to run cppc_get_perf_caps() in order to get just that value alone,
especially when this is done for CPUs other than the one running
the code.

For this reason, introduce cppc_get_nominal_perf() allowing
nominal_perf to be obtained individually, by generalizing the
existing cppc_get_desired_perf() (and renaming it) so it can be
used to retrieve any specific CPPC capability value.

While at it, clean up the cppc_get_desired_perf() kerneldoc comment
a bit.
