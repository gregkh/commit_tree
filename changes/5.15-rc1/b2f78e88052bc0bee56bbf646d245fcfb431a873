btrfs: allow degenerate raid0/raid10

The data on raid0 and raid10 are supposed to be spread over multiple
devices, so the minimum constraints are set to 2 and 4 respectively.
This is an artificial limit and there's some interest to remove it.

Change this to allow raid0 on one device and raid10 on two devices. This
works as expected eg. when converting or removing devices.

The only difference is when raid0 on two devices gets one device
removed. Unpatched would silently create a single profile, while newly
it would be raid0.

The motivation is to allow to preserve the profile type as long as it
possible for some intermediate state (device removal, conversion), or
when there are disks of different size, with raid0 the otherwise
unusable space of the last device will be used too. Similarly for
raid10, though the two largest devices would need to be the same.

Unpatched kernel will mount and use the degenerate profiles just fine
but won't allow any operation that would not satisfy the stricter device
number constraints, eg. not allowing to go from 3 to 2 devices for
raid10 or various profile conversions.

Example output:

  # btrfs fi us -T .
