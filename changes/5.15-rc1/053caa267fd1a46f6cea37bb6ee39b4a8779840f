habanalabs: remove unnecessary device status check

Checking if the device is operational when entering the function to
wait for user interrupt is not something that is useful or necessary.

It is not done in any other wait_for_cs ioctl path.

If the device becomes non-operational during the wait, the reset
function will make sure the process wait is interrupted.

Instead, move the check to the beginning of hl_wait_ioctl(). It will
block any attempt to wait on CS or user interrupt once the device
is already marked as non-operational.
