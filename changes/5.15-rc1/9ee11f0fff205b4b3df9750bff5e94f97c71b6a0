ipv6: ioam: Data plane support for Pre-allocated Trace

Implement support for processing the IOAM Pre-allocated Trace with IPv6,
see [1] and [2]. Introduce a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop TLV option, see IANA [3].

A new per-interface sysctl is introduced. The value is a boolean to accept (=1)
or ignore (=0, by default) IPv6 IOAM options on ingress for an interface:
 - net.ipv6.conf.XXX.ioam6_enabled

Two other sysctls are introduced to define IOAM IDs, represented by an integer.
They are respectively per-namespace and per-interface:
 - net.ipv6.ioam6_id
 - net.ipv6.conf.XXX.ioam6_id

The value of the first one represents the IOAM ID of the node itself (u32; max
and default value = U32_MAX>>8, due to hop limit concatenation) while the other
represents the IOAM ID of an interface (u16; max and default value = U16_MAX).

Each "ioam6_id" sysctl has a "_wide" equivalent:
 - net.ipv6.ioam6_id_wide
 - net.ipv6.conf.XXX.ioam6_id_wide

The value of the first one represents the wide IOAM ID of the node itself (u64;
max and default value = U64_MAX>>8, due to hop limit concatenation) while the
other represents the wide IOAM ID of an interface (u32; max and default value
= U32_MAX).

The use of short and wide equivalents is not exclusive, a deployment could
choose to leverage both. For example, net.ipv6.conf.XXX.ioam6_id (short format)
could be an identifier for a physical interface, whereas
net.ipv6.conf.XXX.ioam6_id_wide (wide format) could be an identifier for a
logical sub-interface. Documentation about new sysctls is provided at the end
of this patchset.

Two relativistic hash tables are used: one for IOAM namespaces, the other for
IOAM schemas. A namespace can only have a single active schema and a schema
can only be attached to a single namespace (1:1 relationship).
