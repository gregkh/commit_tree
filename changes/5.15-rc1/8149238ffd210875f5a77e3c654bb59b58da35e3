powerpc: Redefine HMT_xxx macros as empty on PPC32

HMT_xxx macros are macros for adjusting thread priority
(hardware multi-threading) are macros inherited from PPC64
via commit 5f7c690728ac ("[PATCH] powerpc: Merged ppc_asm.h")

Those instructions are pointless on PPC32, but some common
fonctions like arch_cpu_idle() use them.

So make them empty on PPC32 to avoid those instructions.
