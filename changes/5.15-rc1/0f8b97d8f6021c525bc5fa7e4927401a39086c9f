dt-bindings: PCI: add snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml

Currently, the designware schema is defined on a text file:
	designware-pcie.txt

It contains two separate schemas on it:

- snps,dw-pcie
  This one uses the pci-bus.yaml schema;
- snps,dw-pcie-ep
  This one uses the pci-ep.yaml schema.

As the:
	AllOf:
	  - $ref: <foo>

for the endpoint part is different than the PCI one, place
it on a separate yaml file.
