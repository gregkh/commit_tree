staging: board: Fix uninitialized spinlock when attaching genpd

On Armadillo-800-EVA with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y:

    BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, swapper/1

of_genpd_add_device() is called before platform_device_register(), as it
needs to attach the genpd before the device is probed.  But the spinlock
is only initialized when the device is registered.

Fix this by open-coding the spinlock initialization, cfr.
device_pm_init_common() in the internal drivers/base code, and in the
SuperH early platform code.
