um: fix stub location calculation

In commit 9f0b4807a44f ("um: rework userspace stubs to not hard-code
stub location") I changed stub_segv_handler() to do a calculation with
a pointer to a stack variable to find the data page that we're using
for the stack and the rest of the data. This same commit was meant to
do it as well for stub_clone_handler(), but the change inadvertently
went into commit 84b2789d6115 ("um: separate child and parent errors
in clone stub") instead.

This was reported to not be compiled correctly by gcc 5, causing the
code to crash here. I'm not sure why, perhaps it's UB because the var
isn't initialized? In any case, this trick always seemed bad, so just
create a new inline function that does the calculation in assembly.
