RDMA/mlx5: Delete device resource mutex that didn't protect anything

The dev->devr.mutex was intended to protect GSI QP pointer change in the
struct mlx5_ib_port_resources when it is accessed from the
pkey_change_work. However that pointer isn't changed during the runtime
and once IB/core adds MAD, it stays stable.
