io_uring: remove IRQ aspect of io_ring_ctx completion lock

We have no hard/soft IRQ users of this lock left, remove any IRQ
disabling/saving and restoring when grabbing this lock.

This is straight forward with no users entering with IRQs disabled
anymore, the only thing to look out for is the waitqueue poll head
lock which nests inside the completion lock. That needs IRQs disabled,
and hence we have to do that now instead of relying on the outer lock
doing so.
