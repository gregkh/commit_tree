ASoC: rt5640: Add rt5640_set_ovcd_params() helper

Some devices don't use the builtin jack-detect but can still benefit
from the mic-bias-current over-current-detection to differentiate
between headphones vs a headset.

Move the ovcd init code from rt5640_enable_jack_detect() into a new
rt5640_set_ovcd_params() helper and export this helper as well
as a couple of related ovcd functions.
