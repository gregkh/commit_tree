mm: memcontrol: set the correct memcg swappiness restriction

Since commit c843966c556d ("mm: allow swappiness that prefers reclaiming
anon over the file workingset") has expended the swappiness value to make
swap to be preferred in some systems.  We should also change the memcg
swappiness restriction to allow memcg swap-preferred.
