asus-wmi: Add support for platform_profile

Add initial support for platform_profile where the support is
based on availability of ASUS_THROTTLE_THERMAL_POLICY.

Because throttle_thermal_policy is used by platform_profile and is
writeable separately to platform_profile any userspace changes to
throttle_thermal_policy need to notify platform_profile.

In future throttle_thermal_policy sysfs should be removed so that
only one method controls the laptop power profile.
