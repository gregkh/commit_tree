drm/i915/guc/slpc: Gate Host RPS when SLPC is enabled

Also ensure uc_init is called before we initialize RPS so that we
can check for SLPC support. We do not need to enable up/down
interrupts when SLPC is enabled. However, we still need the ARAT
interrupt, which will be enabled separately later.

v2: Explicitly return from intel_rps_enable with slpc check (Matthew B)
