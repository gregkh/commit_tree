ravb: Add net_features and net_hw_features to struct ravb_hw_info

On R-Car the checksum calculation on RX frames is done by the E-MAC
module, whereas on RZ/G2L it is done by the TOE.

TOE calculates the checksum of received frames from E-MAC and outputs it to
DMAC. TOE also calculates the checksum of transmission frames from DMAC and
outputs it E-MAC.

Add net_features and net_hw_features to struct ravb_hw_info, to support
subsequent SoCs without any code changes in the ravb_probe function.
