kselftest/arm64: mte: Fix misleading output when skipping tests

When skipping the tests due to a lack of system support for MTE we
currently print a message saying FAIL which makes it look like the test
failed even though the test did actually report KSFT_SKIP, creating some
confusion. Change the error message to say SKIP instead so things are
clearer.
