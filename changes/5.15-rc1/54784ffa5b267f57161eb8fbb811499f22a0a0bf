power: supply: max17042: handle fails of reading status register

Reading status register can fail in the interrupt handler.  In such
case, the regmap_read() will not store anything useful under passed
'val' variable and random stack value will be used to determine type of
interrupt.

Handle the regmap_read() failure to avoid handling interrupt type and
triggering changed power supply event based on random stack value.
