net: bridge: vlan: convert mcast router global option to per-vlan entry

The per-vlan router option controls the port/vlan and host vlan entries'
mcast router config. The global option controlled only the host vlan
config, but that is unnecessary and incosistent as it's not really a
global vlan option, but rather bridge option to control host router
config, so convert BRIDGE_VLANDB_GOPTS_MCAST_ROUTER to
BRIDGE_VLANDB_ENTRY_MCAST_ROUTER which can be used to control both host
vlan and port vlan mcast router config.
