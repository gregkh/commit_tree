net: bridge: multicast: add helper to get port mcast context from port group

Add br_multicast_pg_to_port_ctx() which returns the proper port multicast
context from either port or vlan based on bridge option and vlan flags.
As the comment inside explains the locking is a bit tricky, we rely on
the fact that BR_VLFLAG_MCAST_ENABLED requires multicast_lock to change
and we also require it to be held to call that helper. If we find the
vlan under rcu and it still has the flag then we can be sure it will be
alive until we unlock multicast_lock which should be enough.
Note that the context might change from vlan to bridge between different
calls to this helper as the mcast vlan knob requires only rtnl so it should
be used carefully and for read-only/check purposes.
