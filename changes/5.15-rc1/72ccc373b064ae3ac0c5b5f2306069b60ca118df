ARM: dts: meson8b: ec100: Fix the pwm regulator supply properties

After enabling CONFIG_REGULATOR_DEBUG=y we observer below debug logs.
Changes help link VCCK and VDDEE pwm regulator to 5V regulator supply
instead of dummy regulator.

Fixes: 087a1d8b4e4c ("ARM: dts: meson8b: ec100: add the VDDEE regulator")
Fixes: 3e7db1c1b7a3 ("ARM: dts: meson8b: ec100: improve the description of the regulators")
