bpf: Use kvmalloc for map values in syscall

Use kvmalloc/kvfree for temporary value when manipulating a map via
syscall. kmalloc might not be sufficient for percpu maps where the value
is big (and further multiplied by hundreds of CPUs).

Can be reproduced with netcnt test on qemu with "-smp 255".
