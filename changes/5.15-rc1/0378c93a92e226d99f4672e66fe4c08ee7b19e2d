perf/x86/intel/uncore: Support IIO free-running counters on Sapphire Rapids server

Several free-running counters for IIO uncore blocks are supported on
Sapphire Rapids server.

They are not enumerated in the discovery tables. Extend
generic_init_uncores() to support extra uncore types. The uncore types
for the free-running counters is inserted right after the uncore types
retrieved from the discovery table.

The number of the free-running counter boxes is calculated from the max
number of the corresponding standard boxes.
