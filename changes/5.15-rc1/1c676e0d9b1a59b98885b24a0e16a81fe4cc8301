mm/idle_page_tracking: make PG_idle reusable

PG_idle and PG_young allow the two PTE Accessed bit users, Idle Page
Tracking and the reclaim logic concurrently work while not interfering
with each other.  That is, when they need to clear the Accessed bit, they
set PG_young to represent the previous state of the bit, respectively.
And when they need to read the bit, if the bit is cleared, they further
read the PG_young to know whether the other has cleared the bit meanwhile
or not.

For yet another user of the PTE Accessed bit, we could add another page
flag, or extend the mechanism to use the flags.  For the DAMON usecase,
however, we don't need to do that just yet.  IDLE_PAGE_TRACKING and DAMON
are mutually exclusive, so there's only ever going to be one user of the
current set of flags.

In this commit, we split out the CONFIG options to allow for the use of
PG_young and PG_idle outside of idle page tracking.

In the next commit, DAMON's reference implementation of the virtual memory
address space monitoring primitives will use it.
