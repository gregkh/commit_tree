s390/hwcaps: make sie capability regular hwcap

Commit 7f16d7e787b7 ("s390: show virtualization support in /proc/cpuinfo")
introduced special handling for sie capability, saying this should not be
exposed via hwcaps, without giving a reason.

However this leads to an inconsistent /proc/cpuinfo features line
where all features except the sie capability are also present in
hwcaps. I really don't see a reason to not add that to hwcaps - it
might be quite pointless, but at least this way it is possible to get
rid of some special handling.
