dt-bindings: iio: dac: adi,ad5764: Add missing binding document

This binding covers the ad5744, ad5744r, ad5764 and ad5764r DACs.
Note that the driver currently assumes the internal reference is used for
the r parts. The binding as defined relaxes this constraint.

There is no support in the binding or driver for the two digital IO
signals.  I do not propose to add that until we have a means to
test any such binding.
