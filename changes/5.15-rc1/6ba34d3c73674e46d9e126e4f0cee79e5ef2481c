cgroup/cpuset: Fix violation of cpuset locking rule

The cpuset fields that manage partition root state do not strictly
follow the cpuset locking rule that update to cpuset has to be done
with both the callback_lock and cpuset_mutex held. This is now fixed
by making sure that the locking rule is upheld.
