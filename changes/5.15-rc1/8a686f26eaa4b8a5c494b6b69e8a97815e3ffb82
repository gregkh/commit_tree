scsi: ufs: Use DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK() where appropriate

From Documentation/scheduler/completion.rst: "When a completion is declared
as a local variable within a function, then the initialization should
always use DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK() explicitly, not just to make
lockdep happy, but also to make it clear that limited scope had been
considered and is intentional."
