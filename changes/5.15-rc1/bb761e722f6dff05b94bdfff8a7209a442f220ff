iio: light: adjd_s311: convert probe to device-managed functions

Now that the driver's buffer is stored on the adjd_s311_data private
object, the driver is a simple conversion to use only device-managed
functions in the probe.

The iio_triggered_buffer_setup() and iio_device_register() functions are
the only ones needing conversion.
And i2c_set_clientdata() is no longer required.
