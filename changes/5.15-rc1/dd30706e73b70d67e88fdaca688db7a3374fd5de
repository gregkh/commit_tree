scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add key update

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

As part of the authentication process, the authentication application will
generate a SADB entry (Security Association/SA, key, SPI value, etc). This
SADB is then passed to driver to be programmed into hardware. There will be
a pair of SADB's (Tx and Rx) for each connection.

After some period, the application can choose to change the key. At that
time, a new set of SADB pair is given to driver. The old set of SADB will
be deleted.

Add a new bsg call (QL_VND_SC_SA_UPDATE) to allow application to allow
adding or deleting SADB entries.  Driver will not keep the key in
memory. It will pass it to HW.

It is assumed that application will assign a unique SPI value to this SADB
(SA + key). Driver + hardware will assign a handle to track this unique
SPI/SADB.
