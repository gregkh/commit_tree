staging: r8188eu: remove RT_TRACE calls from core/rtw_mlme.c

Remove RT_TRACE macro calls from core/rtw_mlme.c, so that ultimately the
macro definition itself can eventually be removed. Also remove the (now) empty
functions rtw_atimdone_event_callback and rtw_cpwm_event_callback, as
well as their declarations and struct inclusions in the relevant header
files.
