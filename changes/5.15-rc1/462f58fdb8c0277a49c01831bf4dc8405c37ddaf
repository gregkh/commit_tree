mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: Use appropriate type of division macro

The division macro DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST takes int values as the argument.
However the code here uses unsigned int values for this, which is
causing the values comparison with 0 as always true. We can use
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL instead for the same.
