fscache: Fix fscache_cookie_put() to not deref after dec

fscache_cookie_put() accesses the cookie it has just put inside the
tracepoint that monitors the change - but this is something it's not
allowed to do if we didn't reduce the count to zero.

Fix this by dropping most of those values from the tracepoint and grabbing
the cookie debug ID before doing the dec.

Also take the opportunity to switch over the usage and where arguments on
the tracepoint to put the reason last.
