block: return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE if possible

When merging one bio to request, if they are discard IO and the queue
supports multi-range discard, we need to return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE
because both block core and related drivers(nvme, virtio-blk) doesn't
handle mixed discard io merge(traditional IO merge together with
discard merge) well.

Fix the issue by returning ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE in this situation,
so both blk-mq and drivers just need to handle multi-range discard.
