Bluetooth: btintel: Add combined setup and shutdown functions

There are multiple setup and shutdown functions for Intel device and the
setup function to be used is depends on the USB PID/VID, which makes
difficult to maintain the code and increases the code size.

This patch adds combined setup and shutdown functions to provide a
single entry point for all Intel devices and choose the setup functions
based on the information read with HCI_Intel_Read_Version command.

Starting from TyP device, the command and response parameters for
HCI_Intel_Read_Version command are changed even though OCF remains
same. However, the legacy devices still can handle the command without
error even if it has a extra parameter, so to simplify the flow,
the new command format is used to read the version information for
both legacy and new (tlv based) format.

Also, it also adds a routine to setup the hdev callbacks in btintel.
