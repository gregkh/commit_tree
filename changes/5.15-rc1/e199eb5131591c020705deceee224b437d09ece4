perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Sapphire Rapids server IRP support

The IRP is responsible for maintaining coherency for the IIO traffic

The layout of the control registers for a IRP uncore unit is a little
bit different from the generic one.

Factor out SPR_UNCORE_COMMON_FORMAT, which can be reused by the
following uncore units.
