KVM: arm64: Drop check_kvm_target_cpu() based percpu probe

kvm_target_cpu() never returns a negative error code, so check_kvm_target()
would never have 'ret' filled with a negative error code. Hence the percpu
probe via check_kvm_target_cpu() does not make sense as its never going to
find an unsupported CPU, forcing kvm_arch_init() to exit early. Hence lets
just drop this percpu probe (and also check_kvm_target_cpu()) altogether.

While here, this also changes kvm_target_cpu() return type to a u32, making
it explicit that an error code will not be returned from this function.
