writeback: reliably update bandwidth estimation

Currently we trigger writeback bandwidth estimation from
balance_dirty_pages() and from wb_writeback().  However neither of these
need to trigger when the system is relatively idle and writeback is
triggered e.g.  from fsync(2).  Make sure writeback estimates happen
reliably by triggering them from do_writepages().
