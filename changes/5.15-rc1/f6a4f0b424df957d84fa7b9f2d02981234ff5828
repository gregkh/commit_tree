m68k: coldfire: return success for clk_enable(NULL)

The clk_enable is supposed work when CONFIG_HAVE_CLK is false, but it
returns -EINVAL.  That means some drivers fail during probe.

[    1.680000] flexcan: probe of flexcan.0 failed with error -22

Fixes: c1fb1bf64bb6 ("m68k: let clk_enable() return immediately if clk is NULL")
