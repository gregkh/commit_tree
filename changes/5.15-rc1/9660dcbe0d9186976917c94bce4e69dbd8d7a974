RDMA/mlx5: Fix number of allocated XLT entries

In commit 8010d74b9965b ("RDMA/mlx5: Split the WR setup out of
mlx5_ib_update_xlt()") the allocation logic was split out of
mlx5_ib_update_xlt() and the logic was changed to enable better OOM
handling. Sadly this change introduced a miscalculation of the number of
entries that were actually allocated when under memory pressure where it
can actually become 0 which on s390 lets dma_map_single() fail.

It can also lead to corruption of the free pages list when the wrong
number of entries is used in the calculation of sg->length which is used
as argument for free_pages().

Fix this by using the allocation size instead of misusing get_order(size).
