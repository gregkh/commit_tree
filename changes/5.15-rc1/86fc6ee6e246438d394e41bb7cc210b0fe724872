bpf: Relax verifier recursion check.

In the following bpf subprogram:
static int timer_cb(void *map, void *key, void *value)
{
    bpf_timer_set_callback(.., timer_cb);
}

the 'timer_cb' is a pointer to a function.
ld_imm64 insn is used to carry this pointer.
bpf_pseudo_func() returns true for such ld_imm64 insn.

Unlike bpf_for_each_map_elem() the bpf_timer_set_callback() is asynchronous.
Relax control flow check to allow such "recursion" that is seen as an infinite
loop by check_cfg(). The distinction between bpf_for_each_map_elem() the
bpf_timer_set_callback() is done in the follow up patch.
