pinctrl: renesas: Fix pin control matching on R-Car H3e-2G

As R-Car H3 ES1.x (R8A77950) and R-Car ES2.0+ (R8A77951) use the same
compatible value, the pin control driver relies on soc_device_match()
with soc_id = "r8a7795" and the (non)matching of revision = "ES1.*" to
match with and distinguish between the two SoC variants.  The
corresponding entries in the normal of_match_table are present only to
make the optional sanity checks work.

The R-Car H3e-2G (R8A779M1) SoC is a different grading of the R-Car H3
ES3.0 (R8A77951) SoC.  It uses the same compatible values for individual
devices, but has an additional compatible value for the root node.
When running on an R-Car H3e-2G SoC, soc_device_match() with soc_id =
"r8a7795" does not return a match.  Hence the pin control driver falls
back to the normal of_match_table, and, as the R8A77950 entry is listed
first, incorrectly uses the sub-driver for R-Car H3 ES1.x.

Fix this by moving the entry for R8A77951 before the entry for R8A77950.
Simplify sh_pfc_quirk_match() to only handle R-Car H3 ES1,x, as R-Car H3
ES2.0+ can now be matched using the normal of_match_table as well.
