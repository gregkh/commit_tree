locking/atomic: add arch_atomic_long*()

Now that all architectures provide arch_{atomic,atomic64}_*(), we can
build arch_atomic_long_*() atop these, which can be safely used in
noinstr code. The regular atomic_long_*() wrappers are built atop these,
as we do for {atomic,atomic64}_*() atop arch_{atomic,atomic64}_*().

We don't provide arch_* versions of the cond_read*() variants, as we
don't have arch_* versions of the underlying atomic/atomic64 functions
(nor the smp_cond_load*() helpers these are typically based on).

Note that the headers in this patch under include/linux/atomic/ are
generated by the scripts in scripts/atomic/.
