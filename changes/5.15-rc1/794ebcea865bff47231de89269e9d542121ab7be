namei: Standardize callers of filename_lookup()

filename_lookup() has two variants, one which drops the caller's
reference to filename (filename_lookup), and one which does
not (__filename_lookup). This can be confusing as it's unusual to drop a
caller's reference. Remove filename_lookup, rename __filename_lookup
to filename_lookup, and convert all callers. The cost is a few slightly
longer functions, but the clarity is greater.

[AV: consuming a reference is not at all unusual, actually; look at
e.g. do_mkdirat(), for example.  It's more that we want non-consuming
variant for close relative of that function...]
