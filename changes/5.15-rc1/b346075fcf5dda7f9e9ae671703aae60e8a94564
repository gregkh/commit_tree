mm/page_alloc.c: fix 'zone_id' may be used uninitialized in this function warning

When compiling with -Werror, cc1 will warn that 'zone_id' may be used
uninitialized in this function warning.

Initialize the zone_id as 0.

Its safe to assume that if the code reaches this point it has at least one
numa node with memory, so no need for an assertion before
init_unavilable_range.
