powerpc/perf/hv-gpci: Fix counter value parsing

H_GetPerformanceCounterInfo (0xF080) hcall returns the counter data in
the result buffer. Result buffer has specific format defined in the PAPR
specification. One of the fields is counter offset and width of the
counter data returned.

Counter data are returned in a unsigned char array in big endian byte
order. To get the final counter data, the values must be left shifted
byte at a time. But commit 220a0c609ad17 ("powerpc/perf: Add support for
the hv gpci (get performance counter info) interface") made the shifting
bitwise and also assumed little endian order. Because of that, hcall
counters values are reported incorrectly.

In particular this can lead to counters go backwards which messes up the
counter prev vs now calculation and leads to huge counter value
reporting:

Fix the shifting logic to correct match the format, ie. read bytes in
big endian order.
