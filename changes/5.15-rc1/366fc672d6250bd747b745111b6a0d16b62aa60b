iwlwifi: mvm: clean up number of HW queues

Since switching to mac80211 TXQs, we no longer need to
advertise more hardware queues than ACs, since we don't
even set QUEUE_CONTROL anyway, so the vif->hw_queue[]
mapping array won't be used.

All we need (at least for now) is for hw->queues to
indicate that we have enough queues to handle QoS.
