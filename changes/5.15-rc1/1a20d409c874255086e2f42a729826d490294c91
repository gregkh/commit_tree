ACPI: button: Add DMI quirk for Lenovo Yoga 9 (14INTL5)

The Lenovo Yoga 9 (14INTL5)'s ACPI _LID is bugged:

After hibernation the lid is initially reported as closed.
Once closing and then reopening the lid reports the lid as
open again. This leads to the conclusion that the initial
notification of the lid is missing but subsequent
notifications are correct.

In order fo the Linux LID code to handle this device properly
the lid_init_state must be set to ACPI_BUTTON_LID_INIT_OPEN.
