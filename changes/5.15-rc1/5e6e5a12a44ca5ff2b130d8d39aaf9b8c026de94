huge tmpfs: shmem_is_huge(vma, inode, index)

Extend shmem_huge_enabled(vma) to shmem_is_huge(vma, inode, index), so
that a consistent set of checks can be applied, even when the inode is
accessed through read/write syscalls (with NULL vma) instead of mmaps (the
index argument is seldom of interest, but required by mount option
"huge=within_size").  Clean up and rearrange the checks a little.

This then replaces the checks which shmem_fault() and shmem_getpage_gfp()
were making, and eliminates the SGP_HUGE and SGP_NOHUGE modes.

Replace a couple of 0s by explicit SHMEM_HUGE_NEVERs; and replace the
obscure !shmem_mapping() symlink check by explicit S_ISLNK() - nothing
else needs that symlink check, so leave it there in shmem_getpage_gfp().
