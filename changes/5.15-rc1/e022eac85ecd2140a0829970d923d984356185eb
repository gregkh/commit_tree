cacheinfo: clear cache_leaves(cpu) in free_cache_attributes()

On ARM64, when PPTT(Processor Properties Topology Table) is not
implemented in ACPI boot, we will goto 'free_ci' with the following
print:
  Unable to detect cache hierarchy for CPU 0

But some other codes may still use 'num_leaves' to iterate through the
'info_list', such as get_cpu_cacheinfo_id(). If 'info_list' is NULL , it
would crash. So clear 'num_leaves' in free_cache_attributes().
