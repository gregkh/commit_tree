ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix module resource and format selection

Module configuration may differ between its instances depending on
resources required and input and output audio format. Available
parameters to select from are stored in module resource and interface
(format) lists. These come from topology, together with description of
each of pipe's modules.

Ignoring index value provided by topology and relying always on 0th
entry leads to unexpected module behavior due to under/overbudged
resources assigned or impropper format selection. Fix by taking entry at
index specified by topology.
