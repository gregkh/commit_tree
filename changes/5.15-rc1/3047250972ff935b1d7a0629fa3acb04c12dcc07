mm: remove irqsave/restore locking from contexts with irqs enabled

The page cache deletion paths all have interrupts enabled, so no need to
use irqsafe/irqrestore locking variants.

They used to have irqs disabled by the memcg lock added in commit
c4843a7593a9 ("memcg: add per cgroup dirty page accounting"), but that has
since been replaced by memcg taking the page lock instead, commit
0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge AP").
