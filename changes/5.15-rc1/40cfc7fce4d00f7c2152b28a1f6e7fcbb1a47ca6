drm/simple-helper: drm_gem_simple_display_pipe_prepare_fb as default

It's tedious to review this all the time, and my audit showed that
arcpgu actually forgot to set this.

Make this the default and stop worrying.

Again I sprinkled WARN_ON_ONCE on top to make sure we don't have
strange combinations of hooks: cleanup_fb without prepare_fb doesn't
make sense, and since simpler drivers are all new they better be GEM
based drivers.

v2: Warn and bail when it's _not_ a GEM driver (Noralf)

v3: It's neither ... nor, not not (Sam)
