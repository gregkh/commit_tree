mmc: sdhci: Correct the tuning command handle for PIO mode

If sdhci use PIO mode, and use mmc_send_tuning() to send the tuning
command, system will stuck because of the storm irq of sdhci. For PIO mode,
use mmc_send_tuning(), it will trigger buffer_read_ready interrupt and data
transfer complete interrupt.  In current code logic, it will directly
return in sdhci_data_irq, can not call the sdhci_transfer_pio(). So the
buffer_read_ready interrupt storm happen. So for standard tuning method,
need to exclude this case.
