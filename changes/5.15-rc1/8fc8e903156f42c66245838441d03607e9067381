ALSA: hda: Drop workaround for a hang at shutdown again

The commit 0165c4e19f6e ("ALSA: hda: Fix hang during shutdown due to
link reset") modified the shutdown callback of the HD-audio controller
for working around a hang.  Meanwhile, the actual culprit of the hang
was identified to be the leftover active codecs that may interfere
with the powered down controller somehow, but we took a minimal fix
approach for 5.14, and that was the commit above.

Now, since the codec drivers go runtime-suspend at shutdown for 5.15,
we can revert the change and make sure that the full runtime-suspend
is performed at shutdown of HD-audio controller again.  This patch
essentially reverts the commit above to restore the behavior.
