net: bridge: add vlan mcast snooping knob

Add a global knob that controls if vlan multicast snooping is enabled.
The proper contexts (vlan or bridge-wide) will be chosen based on the knob
when processing packets and changing bridge device state. Note that
vlans have their individual mcast snooping enabled by default, but this
knob is needed to turn on bridge vlan snooping. It is disabled by
default. To enable the knob vlan filtering must also be enabled, it
doesn't make sense to have vlan mcast snooping without vlan filtering
since that would lead to inconsistencies. Disabling vlan filtering will
also automatically disable vlan mcast snooping.
