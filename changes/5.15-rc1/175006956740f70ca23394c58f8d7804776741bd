usb: dwc3: qcom: add IRQ check

In dwc3_qcom_acpi_register_core(), the driver neglects to check the result
of platform_get_irq()'s call and blithely assigns the negative error codes
to the allocated child device's IRQ resource and then passing this resource
to platform_device_add_resources() and later causing dwc3_otg_get_irq() to
fail anyway.  Stop calling platform_device_add_resources() with the invalid
IRQ #s, so that there's less complexity in the IRQ error checking.
