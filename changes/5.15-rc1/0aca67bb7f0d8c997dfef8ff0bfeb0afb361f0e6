fanotify: introduce a generic info record copying helper

The copy_info_records_to_user() helper allows for the separation of
info record copying routines/conditionals from copy_event_to_user(),
which reduces the overall clutter within this function. This becomes
especially true as we start introducing additional info records in the
future i.e. struct fanotify_event_info_pidfd. On success, this helper
returns the total amount of bytes that have been copied into the user
supplied buffer and on error, a negative value is returned to the
caller.

The newly defined macro FANOTIFY_INFO_MODES can be used to obtain info
record types that have been enabled for a specific notification
group. This macro becomes useful in the subsequent patch when the
FAN_REPORT_PIDFD initialization flag is introduced.
