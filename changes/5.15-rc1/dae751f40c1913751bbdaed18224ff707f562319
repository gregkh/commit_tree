drm/i915/dg1: Use revid->stepping tables

Switch DG1 to use a revid->stepping table as we're trying to do on all
platforms going forward.

This removes the last use of IS_REVID() and REVID_FOREVER, so remove
those now-unused macros as well to prevent their accidental use on
future platforms.

v2:
 - Use COMMON_STEP() macro in table.  (Anusha)
