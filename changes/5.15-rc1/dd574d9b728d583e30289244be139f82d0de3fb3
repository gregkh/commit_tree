vfio/gvt: Fix open/close when multiple device FDs are open

The user can open multiple device FDs if it likes, however the open
function calls vfio_register_notifier() on device global state. Calling
vfio_register_notifier() twice will trigger a WARN_ON from
notifier_chain_register() and the first close will wrongly delete the
notifier and more.

Since these really want the new open/close_device() semantics just change
the function over.
