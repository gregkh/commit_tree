drm/amdgpu: rectify line endings in umc v8_7_0 IP headers

Commit 6b36fa6143f6 ("drm/amdgpu: add umc v8_7_0 IP headers") adds the new
file ./drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/umc/umc_8_7_0_sh_mask.h with
DOS line endings, which is very uncommon for the kernel repository.

Rectify the line endings in this file with dos2unix.

Identified by a checkpatch evaluation on the whole kernel repository and
spot-checking for really unexpected checkpatch rule violations.
