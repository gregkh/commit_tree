selftests/bpf: Add a test with bpf_timer in inner map.

Check that map-in-map supports bpf timers.

Check that indirect "recursion" of timer callbacks works:
timer_cb1() { bpf_timer_set_callback(timer_cb2); }
timer_cb2() { bpf_timer_set_callback(timer_cb1); }

Check that
  bpf_map_release
    htab_free_prealloced_timers
      bpf_timer_cancel_and_free
        hrtimer_cancel
works while timer cb is running.
"while true; do ./test_progs -t timer_mim; done"
is a great stress test. It caught missing timer cancel in htab->extra_elems.

timer_mim_reject.c is a negative test that checks
that timer<->map mismatch is prevented.
