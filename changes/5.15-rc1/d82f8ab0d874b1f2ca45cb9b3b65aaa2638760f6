net: dsa: tag_dsa: offload the bridge forwarding process

Allow the DSA tagger to generate FORWARD frames for offloaded skbs
sent from a bridge that we offload, allowing the switch to handle any
frame replication that may be required. This also means that source
address learning takes place on packets sent from the CPU, meaning
that return traffic no longer needs to be flooded as unknown unicast.
