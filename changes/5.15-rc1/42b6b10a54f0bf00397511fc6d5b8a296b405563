arm64: mte: avoid TFSRE0_EL1 related operations unless in async mode

There is no reason to touch TFSRE0_EL1 nor issue a DSB unless our task
is in asynchronous mode. Since these operations (especially the DSB) may
be expensive on certain microarchitectures, only perform them if
necessary.

Furthermore, stop clearing TFSRE0_EL1 on entry because it will be
cleared on exit and it is not necessary to have any particular value in
TFSRE0_EL1 between entry and exit.
