io_uring: don't halt iopoll too early

IOPOLL users should care more about getting completions for requests
they submitted, but not in "device did/completed something". Currently,
io_do_iopoll() may return a positive number, which will instruct
io_iopoll_check() to break the loop and end the syscall, even if there
is not enough CQEs or none at all.

Don't return positive numbers, so io_iopoll_check() exits only when it
gets an actual error, need reschedule or got enough CQEs.
