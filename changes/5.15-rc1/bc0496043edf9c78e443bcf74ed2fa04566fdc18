perf evsel: Remove retry_sample_id goto label

As far as I can tell, there is no good reason, apart from optimization
to have the retry_sample_id separate from fallback_missing_features.

Probably, this label was added to avoid reapplying patches for missing
features that had already been applied.

However, missing features that have been added later have not used this
optimization, always jumping to fallback_missing_features and reapplying
all missing features.

This patch removes that label, replacing it with
fallback_missing_features.
