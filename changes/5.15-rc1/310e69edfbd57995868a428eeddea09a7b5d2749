scsi: qla2xxx: Fix hang during NVMe session tear down

The following hung task call trace was seen:

...when device side port resets were done.

Abort threads were getting out without processing due to the "deleted"
flag check. The delete thread, meanwhile, could not proceed with a
logout (that would have cleared out pending requests) as the logout IOCB
work was not progressing. It appears like the hung qlt_free_session_done()
thread is causing the ha->wq works on hold. The qlt_free_session_done()
was hung waiting for nvme_fc_unregister_remoteport() + localport_delete cb
to be complete, which would only happen when all I/Os are released.

Fix this by allowing abort to progress until device delete is completely
done. This should make the qlt_free_session_done() proceed without hang and
thus clear up the deadlock.
