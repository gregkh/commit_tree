net/mlx5: Allocate individual capability

Currently mlx5_core_dev contains array of capabilities. It contains 19
valid capabilities of the device, 2 reserved entries and 12 holes.
Due to this for 14 unused entries, mlx5_core_dev allocates 14 * 8K = 112K
bytes of memory which is never used. Due to this mlx5_core_dev structure
size is 270Kbytes odd. This allocation further aligns to next power of 2
to 512Kbytes.

By skipping non-existent entries,
(a) 112Kbyte is saved,
(b) mlx5_core_dev reduces to 8KB with alignment
(c) 350KB saved in alignment

In future individual capability allocation can be used to skip its
allocation when such capability is disabled at the device level. This
patch prepares mlx5_core_dev to hold capability using a pointer instead
of inline array.
