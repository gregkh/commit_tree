staging: r8188eu: remove ip.h header file

The struct ip_options declared in ip.h is only unsed in the optlength
macro which is also defined in ip.h and not used in the driver code.
All other definitions/declarations in ip.h are duplicated from
<include/uapi/linux/ip.h>. Remove the ip.h header file and its includes.
