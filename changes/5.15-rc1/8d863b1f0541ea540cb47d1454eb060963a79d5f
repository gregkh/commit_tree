xprtrdma: Eliminate rpcrdma_post_sends()

Clean up.

Now that there is only one registration mode, there is only one
target "post_send" method: frwr_send(). rpcrdma_post_sends() no
longer adds much value, especially since all of its call sites
ignore the return code value except to check if it's non-zero.

Just have them call frwr_send() directly instead.
