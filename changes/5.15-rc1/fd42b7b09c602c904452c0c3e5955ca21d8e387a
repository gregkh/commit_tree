KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Initialise vcpu MSR with MSR_ME

It is possible to create a VCPU without setting the MSR before running
it, which results in a warning in kvmhv_vcpu_entry_p9() that MSR_ME is
not set. This is pretty harmless because the MSR_ME bit is added to
HSRR1 before HRFID to guest, and a normal qemu guest doesn't hit it.

Initialise the vcpu MSR with MSR_ME set.
