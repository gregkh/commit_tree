net: ipa: fix ipa_cmd_table_valid()

Stop supporting different sizes for hashed and non-hashed filter or
route tables.  Add BUILD_BUG_ON() calls to verify the sizes of the
fields in the filter/route table initialization immediate command
are the same.

Add a check to ipa_cmd_table_valid() to ensure the size of the
memory region being checked fits within the immediate command field
that must hold it.

Remove two Boolean parameters used only for error reporting.  This
actually fixes a bug that would only show up if IPA_VALIDATE were
defined.  Define ipa_cmd_table_valid() unconditionally (no longer
dependent on IPA_VALIDATE).
