memcg: infrastructure to flush memcg stats

At the moment memcg stats are read in four contexts:

1. memcg stat user interfaces
2. dirty throttling
3. page fault
4. memory reclaim

Currently the kernel flushes the stats for first two cases.  Flushing the
stats for remaining two casese may have performance impact.  Always
flushing the memcg stats on the page fault code path may negatively
impacts the performance of the applications.  In addition flushing in the
memory reclaim code path, though treated as slowpath, can become the
source of contention for the global lock taken for stat flushing because
when system or memcg is under memory pressure, many tasks may enter the
reclaim path.

This patch uses following mechanisms to solve these challenges:

1. Periodically flush the stats from root memcg every 2 seconds.  This
   will time limit the out of sync stats.

2. Asynchronously flush the stats after fixed number of stat updates.
   In the worst case the stat can be out of sync by O(nr_cpus * BATCH) for
   2 seconds.

3. For avoiding thundering herd to flush the stats particularly from
   the memory reclaim context, introduce memcg local spinlock and let only
   one flusher active at a time.  This could have been done through
   cgroup_rstat_lock lock but that lock is used by other subsystem and for
   userspace reading memcg stats.  So, it is better to keep flushers
   introduced by this patch decoupled from cgroup_rstat_lock.  However we
   would have to use irqsafe version of rstat flush but that is fine as
   this code path will be flushing for whole tree and do the work for
   everyone.  No one will be waiting for that worker.
