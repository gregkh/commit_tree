drm/stm: dsi: compute the transition time from LP to HS and back

The driver uses a conservative set of hardcoded values for the
maximum time delay of the transitions between LP and HS, either
for data and clock lanes.

By using the info in STM32MP157 datasheet, valid also for other ST
devices, compute the actual delay from the lane's bps.
