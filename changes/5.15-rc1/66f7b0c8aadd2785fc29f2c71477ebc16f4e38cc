timerfd: Provide timerfd_resume()

Resuming timekeeping is a clock-was-set event and uses the clock-was-set
notification mechanism. This is in the way of making the clock-was-set
update for hrtimers selective so unnecessary IPIs are avoided when a CPU
base does not have timers queued which are affected by the clock setting.

Provide a seperate timerfd_resume() interface so the resume logic and the
clock-was-set mechanism can be distangled in the core code.
