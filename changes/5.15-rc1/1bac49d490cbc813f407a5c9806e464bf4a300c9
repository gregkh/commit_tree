KVM: arm64: Provide the host_stage2_try() helper macro

We currently unmap all MMIO mappings from the host stage-2 to recycle
the pages whenever we run out. In order to make this pattern easy to
re-use from other places, factor the logic out into a dedicated macro.
While at it, apply the macro for the kvm_pgtable_stage2_set_owner()
calls. They're currently only called early on and are guaranteed to
succeed, but making them robust to the -ENOMEM case doesn't hurt and
will avoid painful debugging sessions later on.
