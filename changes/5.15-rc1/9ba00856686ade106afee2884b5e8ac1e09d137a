ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add support for HP Elite Pad 1000G2 jack-detect

The HP Elitepad 1000 G2 tablet has 2 headset jacks:

1. on the dock which uses the output of the codecs built-in HP-amp +
the standard IN2 input which is always used with the headset-jack.

2. on the tablet itself, this uses the line-out of the codec + an external
HP-amp, which gets enabled by the ALC5642 codec's GPIO1 pin; and IN1 for
the headset-mic.

The codec's GPIO1 is also its only IRQ output pin, so this means that
the codec's IRQ cannot be used on this tablet. Instead the jack-detect
is connected directly to GPIOs on the main SoC. The dock has a helper
chip which also detects if a headset-mic is present or not, so there
are 2 GPIOs for the jack-detect status of the dock. The tablet jack
uses a single GPIO which indicates if a jack is present or not.

Differentiating between headphones vs a headset on the tablet jack
is done by using the usual mic-bias over-current-detection mechanism.

Add support for this unique setup, this support gets enabled on this
tablet through a new BYT_RT5640_JD_HP_ELITEP_1000G2 quirk.
