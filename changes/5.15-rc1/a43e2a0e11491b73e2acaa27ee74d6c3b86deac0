drm/amdkfd: Allow querying SVM attributes that are clear

Currently the SVM get_attr call allows querying, which flags are set
in the entire address range. Add the opposite query, which flags are
clear in the entire address range. Both queries can be combined in a
single get_attr call, which allows answering questions such as, "is
this address range coherent, non-coherent, or a mix of both"?
