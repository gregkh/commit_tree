libata: cleanup device sleep capability detection

Move the code to retrieve the device sleep capability and timings out of
ata_dev_configure() into the helper function ata_dev_config_devslp().
While at it, mark the device as supporting the device sleep capability
only if the sata settings page was retrieved successfully to ensure that
the timing information is correctly initialized.
