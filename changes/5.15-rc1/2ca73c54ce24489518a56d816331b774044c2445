powerpc/pseries/iommu: Allow DDW windows starting at 0x00

enable_ddw() currently returns the address of the DMA window, which is
considered invalid if has the value 0x00.

Also, it only considers valid an address returned from find_existing_ddw
if it's not 0x00.

Changing this behavior makes sense, given the users of enable_ddw() only
need to know if direct mapping is possible. It can also allow a DMA window
starting at 0x00 to be used.

This will be helpful for using a DDW with indirect mapping, as the window
address will be different than 0x00, but it will not map the whole
partition.
