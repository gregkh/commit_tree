ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Use cfg-lineout:2 in the components string

Use "cfg-lineout:2" in the components string on boards with a lineout
instead of "cfg-lineout:1", this better mirrors the speaker part of
the components string where we use "cfg-spk:1" for devices with a single
speaker and "cfg-spk:2" for stereo speakers.

The lineout is stereo by default, so using ":2" makes more sense, this
way we keep ":1" reserved in case we ever encounter a device with
a mono lineout.

We can make this change without breaking userspace because no kernel
has shipped with "cfg-lineout:1" in the component-string yet; and there
also are no userspace bits (UCM profiles) checking for this yet.
