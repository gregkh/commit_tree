libbpf: Return non-null error on failures in libbpf_find_prog_btf_id()

Variable "err" is initialised to -EINVAL so that this error code is
returned when something goes wrong in libbpf_find_prog_btf_id().
However, a recent change in the function made use of the variable in
such a way that it is set to 0 if retrieving linear information on the
program is successful, and this 0 value remains if we error out on
failures at later stages.

Let's fix this by setting err to -EINVAL later in the function.
