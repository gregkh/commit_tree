drm/amd/display: Fixed hardware power down bypass during headless boot

[Why]
During headless boot, DIG may be on which causes HW/SW discrepancies.
To avoid this we power down hardware on boot if DIG is turned on. With
introduction of multiple eDP, hardware power down is being bypassed
under certain conditions.

[How]
Fixed hardware power down bypass, and ensured hardware will power down
if DIG is on and seamless boot is not enabled.
