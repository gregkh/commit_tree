kcsan: use u64 instead of cycles_t

cycles_t has a different type across architectures: unsigned int,
unsinged long, or unsigned long long. Depending on architecture this
will generate this warning:

kernel/kcsan/debugfs.c: In function ‘microbenchmark’:
./include/linux/kern_levels.h:5:25: warning: format ‘%llu’ expects argument of type ‘long long unsigned int’, but argument 3 has type ‘cycles_t’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} [-Wformat=]

To avoid this simply change the type of cycle to u64 in microbenchmark(),
since u64 is of type unsigned long long for all architectures.
