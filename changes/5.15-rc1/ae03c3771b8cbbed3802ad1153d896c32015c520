vfio: Introduce a vfio_uninit_group_dev() API call

This pairs with vfio_init_group_dev() and allows undoing any state that is
stored in the vfio_device unrelated to registration. Add appropriately
placed calls to all the drivers.

The following patch will use this to add pre-registration state for the
device set.
