drm/i915/gem: Call i915_gem_flush_free_objects() in i915_gem_dumb_create()

This doesn't really fix anything serious since the chances of a client
creating and destroying a mass of dumb BOs is pretty low.  However, it
is called by the other two create IOCTLs to garbage collect old objects.
Call it here too for consistency.
