net: bridge: mcast: make sure querier port/address updates are consistent

Use a sequence counter to make sure port/address updates can be read
consistently without requiring the bridge multicast_lock. We need to
zero out the port and address when the other querier has expired and
we're about to select ourselves as querier. br_multicast_read_querier
will be used later when dumping querier state. Updates are done only
with the multicast spinlock and softirqs disabled, while reads are done
from process context and from softirqs (due to notifications).
