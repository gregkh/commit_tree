interconnect: qcom: osm-l3: Use driver-specific naming

In situations were the developer screws up by e.g. not giving the OSM
nodes unique identifiers the interconnect framework might mix up nodes
between the OSM L3 provider and e.g. the RPMh provider.

The resulting callstack contains "qcom_icc_set", which is not unique to
the OSM L3 provider driver. Once the faulting qcom_icc_set() is
identified it's further confusing that "qcom_icc_node" is different
between the different drivers.

To avoid this confusion, rename the node struct and the setter in the
OSM L3 driver to include "osm_l3" in their names.
