KVM: xen: do not use struct gfn_to_hva_cache

gfn_to_hva_cache is not thread-safe, so it is usually used only within
a vCPU (whose code is protected by vcpu->mutex).  The Xen interface
implementation has such a cache in kvm->arch, but it is not really
used except to store the location of the shared info page.  Replace
shinfo_set and shinfo_cache with just the value that is passed via
KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO; the only complication is that the
initialization value is not zero anymore and therefore kvm_xen_init_vm
needs to be introduced.
