net: phy: intel-xway: Add RGMII internal delay configuration

This adds the possibility to configure the RGMII RX/TX clock skew via
devicetree.

Simply set phy mode to "rgmii-id", "rgmii-rxid" or "rgmii-txid" and add
the "rx-internal-delay-ps" or "tx-internal-delay-ps" property to the
devicetree.

Furthermore, a warning is now issued if the phy mode is configured to
"rgmii" and an internal delay is set in the phy (e.g. by pin-strapping),
as in the dp83867 driver.
