docs: sphinx-requirements: Move sphinx_rtd_theme to top

sphinx_rtd_theme 0.5.2 has "docutils<0.17" in its requirements.
docutils 0.17 released this April caused regression in
sphinx_rtd_theme 0.5.1 [1].

By removing docutils and moving sphinx_rtd_theme before Sphinx in
requirements.txt, the requirement of "docutils<0.17" can be met
naturally.
