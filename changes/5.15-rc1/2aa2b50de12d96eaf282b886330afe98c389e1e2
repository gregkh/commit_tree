arm64: dts: qcom: Use correct naming for dwc3 usb nodes in dts files

The dwc3 usb nodes in several arm64 qcom dts are currently named
differently, somewhere as 'usb@<addr>' and somewhere as 'dwc3@<addr>',
leading to some confusion when one sees the entries in sysfs or
dmesg:
[    1.943482] dwc3 a600000.usb: Adding to iommu group 1
[    2.266127] dwc3 a800000.dwc3: Adding to iommu group 2

Name the usb nodes as 'usb@<addr>' for consistency, which is
the correct convention as per the 'snps,dwc3' dt-binding as
well (see [1]).
