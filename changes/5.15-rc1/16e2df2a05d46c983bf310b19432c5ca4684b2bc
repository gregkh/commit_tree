fs: drop_caches: fix skipping over shadow cache inodes

When drop_caches truncates the page cache in an inode it also includes any
shadow entries for evicted pages.  However, there is a preliminary check
on whether the inode has pages: if it has *only* shadow entries, it will
skip running truncation on the inode and leave it behind.

Fix the check to mapping_empty(), such that it runs truncation on any
inode that has cache entries at all.
