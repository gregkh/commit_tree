printk: Straighten out log_flags into printk_info_flags

In the past, `enum log_flags` was part of `struct log`, hence the name.
`struct log` has since been reworked and now this struct is stored
inside `struct printk_info`. However, the name was never updated, which
is somewhat confusing -- especially since these flags operate at the
record level rather than at the level of an abstract log.

printk_info_flags also joins its other metadata struct friends in
printk_ringbuffer.h.
