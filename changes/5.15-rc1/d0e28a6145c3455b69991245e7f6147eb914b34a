powerpc/config: Renable MTD_PHYSMAP_OF

CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_OF is not longer enabled as it depends on
MTD_PHYSMAP which is not enabled.

This is a regression from commit 642b1e8dbed7 ("mtd: maps: Merge
physmap_of.c into physmap-core.c"), which added the extra dependency.
Add CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP=y so this stays in the config, as Christophe said
it is useful for build coverage.
