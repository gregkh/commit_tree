kcsan: Print if strict or non-strict during init

Show a brief message if KCSAN is strict or non-strict, and if non-strict
also say that CONFIG_KCSAN_STRICT=y can be used to see all data races.

This is to hint to users of KCSAN who blindly use the default config
that their configuration might miss data races of interest.
