staging: r8188eu: introduce new supporting files for RTL8188eu driver

This patchset is split in order to keep the file sizes down. These
supporting files are part of the newer/better driver from GitHub modified by
Larry Finger. Import this as the basis for all future work going
forward. Also, modify Makefile so that driver has same module filename
as original rtl8188eu driver from staging, and rename config params to
fit the Kconfig file taken from the old driver. Finally, reword Kconfig
description to make it clear this is a newer driver.
