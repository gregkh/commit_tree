ALSA: es1938: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in PCI es1938 driver with
devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is converted
with the corresponding devres helper, and the card object release is
managed now via card->private_free instead of a lowlevel snd_device.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
