pwm: omap-dmtimer: Don't check the return code of pwmchip_remove()

pwmchip_remove() returns always 0. Don't use the value to make it
possible to eventually change the function to return void. Also the
driver core ignores the return value of pwm_omap_dmtimer_remove()
and considers the device removed anyhow. So returning early results
in a resource leak.
