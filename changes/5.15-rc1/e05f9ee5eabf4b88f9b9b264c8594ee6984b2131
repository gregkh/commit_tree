ASoC: qdsp6: q6asm: fix cppcheck warnings for unnecessary initialization

cppcheck reports below warning.
q6asm.c:1631: (style) Variable 'port' is reassigned a value before the
old one has been used.

This is due to unnecessary initialization of variable port, which is
now removed as part of this patch.
