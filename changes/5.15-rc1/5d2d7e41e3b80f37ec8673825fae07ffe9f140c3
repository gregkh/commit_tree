KVM: SVM: Drop explicit MMU reset at RESET/INIT

Drop an explicit MMU reset in SVM's vCPU RESET/INIT flow now that the
common x86 path correctly handles conditional MMU resets, e.g. if INIT
arrives while the vCPU is in 64-bit mode.

This reverts commit ebae871a509d ("kvm: svm: reset mmu on VCPU reset").
