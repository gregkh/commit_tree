memory-hotplug.rst: complete admin-guide overhaul

The memory hot(un)plug documentation is outdated and incomplete.  Most of
the content dates back to 2007, so it's time for a major overhaul.

Let's rewrite, reorganize and update most parts of the documentation.  In
addition to memory hot(un)plug, also add some details regarding
ZONE_MOVABLE, with memory hotunplug being one of its main consumers.

Drop the file history, that information can more reliably be had from the
git log.

The style of the document is also properly fixed that e.g., "restview"
renders it cleanly now.

In the future, we might add some more details about virt users like
virtio-mem, the XEN balloon, the Hyper-V balloon and ppc64 dlpar.
