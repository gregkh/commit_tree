fuse: move option checking into fuse_fill_super()

Checking whether the "fd=", "rootmode=", "user_id=" and "group_id=" mount
options are present can be moved from fuse_get_tree() into
fuse_fill_super() where the value of the options are consumed.

This relaxes semantics of reusing a fuse blockdev mount using the device
name.  Before this patch presence of these options were enforced but values
ignored, after this patch these options are completely ignored in this
case.
