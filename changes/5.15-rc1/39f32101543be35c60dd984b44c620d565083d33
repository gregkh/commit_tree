net: dsa: don't fast age standalone ports

DSA drives the procedure to flush dynamic FDB entries from a port based
on the change of STP state: whenever we go from a state where address
learning is enabled (LEARNING, FORWARDING) to a state where it isn't
(LISTENING, BLOCKING, DISABLED), we need to flush the existing dynamic
entries.

However, there are cases when this is not needed. Internally, when a
DSA switch interface is not under a bridge, DSA still keeps it in the
"FORWARDING" STP state. And when that interface joins a bridge, the
bridge will meticulously iterate that port through all STP states,
starting with BLOCKING and ending with FORWARDING. Because there is a
state transition from the standalone version of FORWARDING into the
temporary BLOCKING bridge port state, DSA calls the fast age procedure.

Since commit 5e38c15856e9 ("net: dsa: configure better brport flags when
ports leave the bridge"), DSA asks standalone ports to disable address
learning. Therefore, there can be no dynamic FDB entries on a standalone
port. Therefore, it does not make sense to flush dynamic FDB entries on
one.
