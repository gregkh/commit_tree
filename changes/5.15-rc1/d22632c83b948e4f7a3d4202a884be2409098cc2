drm/i915: support forcing the page size with lmem

For some specialised objects we might need something larger than the
regions min_page_size due to some hw restriction, and slightly more
hairy is needing something smaller with the guarantee that such objects
will never be inserted into any GTT, which is the case for the paging
structures.

This also fixes how we setup the BO page_alignment, if we later migrate
the object somewhere else. For example if the placements are {SMEM,
LMEM}, then we might get this wrong. Pushing the min_page_size behaviour
into the manager should fix this.

v2(Thomas): push the default page size behaviour into buddy_man, and let
the user override it with the page-alignment, which looks cleaner

v3: rebase on ttm sys changes
