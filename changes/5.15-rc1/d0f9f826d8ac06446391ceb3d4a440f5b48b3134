KVM: SVM: Stuff save->dr6 at during VMSA sync, not at RESET/INIT

Move code to stuff vmcb->save.dr6 to its architectural init value from
svm_vcpu_reset() into sev_es_sync_vmsa().  Except for protected guests,
a.k.a. SEV-ES guests, vmcb->save.dr6 is set during VM-Enter, i.e. the
extra write is unnecessary.  For SEV-ES, stuffing save->dr6 handles a
theoretical case where the VMSA could be encrypted before the first
KVM_RUN.
