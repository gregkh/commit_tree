KVM: arm64: Allow populating software bits

Introduce infrastructure allowing to manipulate software bits in stage-1
and stage-2 page-tables using additional entries in the kvm_pgtable_prot
enum.

This is heavily inspired by Marc's implementation of a similar feature
in the NV patch series, but adapted to allow stage-1 changes as well:
