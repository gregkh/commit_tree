KVM: s390: index kvm->arch.idle_mask by vcpu_idx

While in practice vcpu->vcpu_idx ==  vcpu->vcp_id is often true, it may
not always be, and we must not rely on this. Reason is that KVM decides
the vcpu_idx, userspace decides the vcpu_id, thus the two might not
match.

Currently kvm->arch.idle_mask is indexed by vcpu_id, which implies
that code like
for_each_set_bit(vcpu_id, kvm->arch.idle_mask, online_vcpus) {
                vcpu = kvm_get_vcpu(kvm, vcpu_id);
		do_stuff(vcpu);
}
is not legit. Reason is that kvm_get_vcpu expects an vcpu_idx, not an
vcpu_id.  The trouble is, we do actually use kvm->arch.idle_mask like
this. To fix this problem we have two options. Either use
kvm_get_vcpu_by_id(vcpu_id), which would loop to find the right vcpu_id,
or switch to indexing via vcpu_idx. The latter is preferable for obvious
reasons.

Let us make switch from indexing kvm->arch.idle_mask by vcpu_id to
indexing it by vcpu_idx.  To keep gisa_int.kicked_mask indexed by the
same index as idle_mask lets make the same change for it as well.
