x86/resctrl: Group staged configuration into a separate struct

When configuration changes are made, the new value is written to struct
rdt_domain's new_ctrl field and the have_new_ctrl flag is set. Later
new_ctrl is copied to hardware by a call to update_domains().

Once the CDP resources are merged, there will be one new_ctrl field in
use by two struct resctrl_schema requiring a per-schema IPI to copy the
value to hardware.

Move new_ctrl and have_new_ctrl into a new struct resctrl_staged_config.
Before the CDP resources can be merged, struct rdt_domain will need an
array of these, one per type of configuration. Using the type as an
index to the array will ensure that a schema configuration string can't
specify the same domain twice.
