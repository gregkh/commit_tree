cgroup/cpuset: Enable event notification when partition state changes

A valid cpuset partition can become invalid if all its CPUs are offlined
or somehow removed. This can happen through external events without
"cpuset.cpus.partition" being touched at all.

Users that rely on the property of a partition being present do not
currently have a simple way to get such an event notified other than
constant periodic polling which is both inefficient and cumbersome.

To make life easier for those users, event notification is now enabled
for "cpuset.cpus.partition" whenever its state changes.
