phy: phy-twl4030-usb: Disable PHY for suspend

Since commit 88d26136a256 ("PM: Prevent runtime suspend during system
resume"), PM runtime will not let devices idle during system suspend.

This is because of the pm_runtime_get_noresume() call done in
device_prepare() that is not released until at device_complete() after
resume.

We must now disable the USB PHY in suspend if no USB cable is connected.
