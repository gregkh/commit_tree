drm/i915/xelpd: break feature inheritance

It's becoming pretty cumbersome to track the features enabled going back
to GEN7. Gather the XE_LPD display features together in XE_LPD_FEATURES
macro so they are sufficient to describe the display features.

In ADL-P's device_info we set has_psr_hw_tracking to 0 as it would
otherwise be enabled since it is inheriting from GEN12_FEATURES.
