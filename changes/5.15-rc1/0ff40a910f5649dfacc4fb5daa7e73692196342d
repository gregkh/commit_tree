btrfs: introduce btrfs_search_backwards function

It's a common practice to start a search using offset (u64)-1, which is
the u64 maximum value, meaning that we want the search_slot function to
be set in the last item with the same objectid and type.

Once we are in this position, it's a matter to start a search backwards
by calling btrfs_previous_item, which will check if we'll need to go to
a previous leaf and other necessary checks, only to be sure that we are
in last offset of the same object and type.

The new btrfs_search_backwards function does the all these steps when
necessary, and can be used to avoid code duplication.
