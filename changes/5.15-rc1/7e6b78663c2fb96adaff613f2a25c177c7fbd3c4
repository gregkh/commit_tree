dt-bindings: iio: accel: bma255: Merge bosch,bma180 schema

In Linux the bma180 and bmc150-accel driver cover fairly similar chips
from Bosch (just with minor register differences). For the DT schema,
this does not make any difference: They both represent I2C/SPI devices,
have one or two interrupts plus a vdd/vddio-supply.

This means there is no need to duplicate the schema, we can just
document the compatibles for both drivers in a single DT schema.
