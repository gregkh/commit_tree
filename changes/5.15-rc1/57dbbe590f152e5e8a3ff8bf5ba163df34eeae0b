powerpc/pseries/iommu: Rename "direct window" to "dma window"

A previous change introduced the usage of DDW as a bigger indirect DMA
mapping when the DDW available size does not map the whole partition.

As most of the code that manipulates direct mappings was reused for
indirect mappings, it's necessary to rename all names and debug/info
messages to reflect that it can be used for both kinds of mapping.

This should cause no behavioural change, just adjust naming.
