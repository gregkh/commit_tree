scsi: qla4xxx: Convert uses of __constant_cpu_to_<foo> to cpu_to_<foo>

The macros cpu_to_le16() and cpu_to_le32() have special cases for
constants.  Their __constant_<foo> versions are not required.

On little endian systems, both cpu_to_le16() and __constant_cpu_to_le16()
expand to the same expression. Same is the case with cpu_to_le32().

On big endian systems, cpu_to_le16() expands to __swab16() which has a
__builtin_constant_p check. Similarly, cpu_to_le32() expands to __swab32().

Consequently these macros can be safely used with constants, and hence all
those uses are converted. This was discovered as a part of a checkpatch
evaluation, looking at all reports of WARNING:CONSTANT_CONVERSION error
type.
