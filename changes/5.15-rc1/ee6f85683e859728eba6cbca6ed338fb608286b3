PCI: artpec6: Remove surplus break statement after return

As part of code refactoring completed in a0fd361db8e5 ("PCI: dwc: Move
"dbi", "dbi2", and "addr_space" resource setup into common code"),
artpec6_add_pcie_ep() was removed and the call to the dw_pcie_ep_init()
was moved into artpec6_pcie_probe().

This left a break statement behind that is not needed any more as
artpec6_pcie_probe() returns immediately after calling dw_pcie_ep_init().

Remove this surplus break statement that became dead code.
