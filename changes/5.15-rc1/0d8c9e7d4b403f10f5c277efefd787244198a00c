vdpa_sim: Use iova_shift() for the size passed to alloc_iova()

The size passed to alloc_iova() should be the size of page frames.
Now we use byte granularity for the iova domain, so it's safe to
pass the size in bytes to alloc_iova(). But it would be better to use
iova_shift() for the size to avoid future bugs if we change granularity.
