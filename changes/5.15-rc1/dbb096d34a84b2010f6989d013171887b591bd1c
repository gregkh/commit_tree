arm64: tegra194: p2888: Correct interrupt trigger type of temperature sensor

The LM90 temperature sensor should use edge-triggered interrupt because
LM90 hardware doesn't deassert interrupt line until temperature is back
to normal state, which results in interrupt storm. Correct the interrupt
trigger type.
