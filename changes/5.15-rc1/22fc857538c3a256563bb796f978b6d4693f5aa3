dt-bindings: thermal: Make trips node optional

Even though the previous binding made it a required child node, the
implementation in Linux never made it mandatory and just ignored thermal
zones without trip points.

This was even effectively encouraged, since the thermal core wouldn't
allow a thermal sensor to probe without a thermal zone.

In the case where you had a thermal device that had multiple sensors but
with enough knowledge to provide trip points for only a few of them,
this meant that the only way to make that driver probe was to provide a
thermal zone without the trips node required by the binding.

This obviously led to a fair number of device trees doing exactly that,
making the initial binding requirement ineffective.

Let's make it clear by dropping that requirement.
