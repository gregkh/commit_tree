tracing/probes: Have process_fetch_insn() take a void * instead of pt_regs

In preparation to allow event probes to use the process_fetch_insn()
callback in trace_probe_tmpl.h, change the data passed to it from a
pointer to pt_regs, as the event probe will not be using regs, and make it
a void pointer instead.

Update the process_fetch_insn() callers for kprobe and uprobe events to
have the regs defined in the function and just typecast the void pointer
parameter.
