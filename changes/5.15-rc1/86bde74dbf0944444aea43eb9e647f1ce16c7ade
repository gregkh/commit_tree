ALSA: atiixp: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

Like the previous patch, this patch converts the resource allocations
with device-managed API calls, so that we can reduce resource-free
calls.

The atiixp drivers are simpler than intel8x0, and even the irq can be
allocated with devres.

The end result is a good amount of code reduction.
