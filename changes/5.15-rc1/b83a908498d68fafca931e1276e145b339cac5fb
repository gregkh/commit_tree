compiler_attributes.h: move __compiletime_{error|warning}

Clang 14 will add support for __attribute__((__error__(""))) and
__attribute__((__warning__(""))). To make use of these in
__compiletime_error and __compiletime_warning (as used by BUILD_BUG and
friends) for newer clang and detect/fallback for older versions of
clang, move these to compiler_attributes.h and guard them with
__has_attribute preprocessor guards.
