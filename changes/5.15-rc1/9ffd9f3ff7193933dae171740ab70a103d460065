bpf: Add bpf_get_func_ip helper for kprobe programs

Adding bpf_get_func_ip helper for BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE programs,
so it's now possible to call bpf_get_func_ip from both kprobe and
kretprobe programs.

Taking the caller's address from 'struct kprobe::addr', which is
defined for both kprobe and kretprobe.
