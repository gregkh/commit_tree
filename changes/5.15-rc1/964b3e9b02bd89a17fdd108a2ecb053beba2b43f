power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Move the AXP20X_CC_CTRL check together with the other checks

The I2C-bus to the XPower AXP288 is shared between the Linux kernel and
the SoCs P-Unit. The P-Unit has a semaphore which the kernel must "lock"
before it may use the bus. If not explicitly taken by the I2C-driver,
then this semaphore is automatically taken by the I2C-bus-driver for
each I2C-transfer.

Move the AXP20X_CC_CTRL check done in probe() together with the other
register-accesses done in probe, so that we can take the semaphore once
for the entire set of register-accesses.
