media: imx: imx7-media-csi: Don't set PIXEL_BIT in CSICR1

The PIXEL_BIT field of the CSICR1 register is documented as setting the
Bayer data width to 10 bits, and is set by the driver for all non-YUV
pixel formats. Test code from NXP showed that the bit shouldn't be set
for Bayer formats, and this was confirmed by experimentation with RAW8
capture (which doesn't work when setting the field) and RAW10 capture
(for which setting the field doesn't seem to make a difference) on
i.MX8MM with an OV5640 sensor connected over CSI-2. Don't set it.
