blk-mq: allow 4x BLK_MAX_REQUEST_COUNT at blk_plug for multiple_queues

Limiting number of request to BLK_MAX_REQUEST_COUNT at blk_plug hurts
performance for large md arrays. [1] shows resync speed of md array drops
for md array with more than 16 HDDs.

Fix this by allowing more request at plug queue. The multiple_queue flag
is used to only apply higher limit to multiple queue cases.
