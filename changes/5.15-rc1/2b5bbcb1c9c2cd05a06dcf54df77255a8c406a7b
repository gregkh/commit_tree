huge tmpfs: remove shrinklist addition from shmem_setattr()

There's a block of code in shmem_setattr() to add the inode to
shmem_unused_huge_shrink()'s shrinklist when lowering i_size: it dates
from before 5.7 changed truncation to do split_huge_page() for itself, and
should have been removed at that time.

I am over-stating that: split_huge_page() can fail (notably if there's an
extra reference to the page at that time), so there might be value in
retrying.  But there were already retries as truncation worked through the
tails, and this addition risks repeating unsuccessful retries
indefinitely: I'd rather remove it now, and work on reducing the chance of
split_huge_page() failures separately, if we need to.
