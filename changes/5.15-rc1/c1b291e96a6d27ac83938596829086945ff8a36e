gpio: dwapb: Unify ACPI enumeration checks in get_irq() and configure_irqs()

Shared IRQ is only enabled for ACPI enumeration, there is no need
to have a special flag for that, since we simple can test if device
has been enumerated by ACPI. This unifies the checks in dwapb_get_irq()
and dwapb_configure_irqs().
