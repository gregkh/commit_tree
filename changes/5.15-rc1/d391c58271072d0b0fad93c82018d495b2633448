drivers/firmware: move x86 Generic System Framebuffers support

The x86 architecture has generic support to register a system framebuffer
platform device. It either registers a "simple-framebuffer" if the config
option CONFIG_X86_SYSFB is enabled, or a legacy VGA/VBE/EFI FB device.

But the code is generic enough to be reused by other architectures and can
be moved out of the arch/x86 directory.

This will allow to also support the simple{fb,drm} drivers on non-x86 EFI
platforms, such as aarch64 where these drivers are only supported with DT.
