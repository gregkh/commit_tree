mm, slub: move reset of c->page and freelist out of deactivate_slab()

deactivate_slab() removes the cpu slab by merging the cpu freelist with slab's
freelist and putting the slab on the proper node's list. It also sets the
respective kmem_cache_cpu pointers to NULL.

By extracting the kmem_cache_cpu operations from the function, we can make it
not dependent on disabled irqs.

Also if we return a single free pointer from ___slab_alloc, we no longer have
to assign kmem_cache_cpu.page before deactivation or care if somebody preempted
us and assigned a different page to our kmem_cache_cpu in the process.
