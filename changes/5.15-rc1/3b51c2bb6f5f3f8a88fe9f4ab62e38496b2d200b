drm/i915/dpcd_bl: Cache some backlight capabilities in intel_panel.backlight

Since we're about to be moving this code into shared DRM helpers, we might
as well start to cache certain backlight capabilities that can be
determined from the EDP DPCD, and are likely to be relevant to the majority
of drivers using said helpers. The main purpose of this is just to prevent
every driver from having to check everything against the eDP DPCD using DP
macros, which makes the code slightly easier to read (especially since the
names of some of the eDP capabilities don't exactly match up with what we
actually need to use them for, like DP_EDP_BACKLIGHT_BRIGHTNESS_BYTE_COUNT
for instance).
