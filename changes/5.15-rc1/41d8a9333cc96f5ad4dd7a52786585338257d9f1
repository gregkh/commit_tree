scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Add HPB 2.0 support

Version 2.0 of HBP supports reads of varying sizes from 4KB to 1MB.

A read operation <= 32KB is supported as single HPB read. A read between
36KB and 1MB is supported by a combination of write buffer command and HPB
read command to deliver more PPN. The write buffer commands may not be
issued immediately due to busy tags. To use HPB read more aggressively, the
driver can requeue the write buffer command. The requeue threshold is
implemented as timeout and can be modified with requeue_timeout_ms entry in
sysfs.
