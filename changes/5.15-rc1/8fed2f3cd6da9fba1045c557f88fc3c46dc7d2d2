mm: gup: remove set but unused local variable major

Patch series "Cleanups and fixup for gup".

This series contains cleanups to remove unneeded variable, useless BUG_ON
and use helper to improve readability.  Also we fix a potential pgmap
refcnt leak.  More details can be found in the respective changelogs.

This patch (of 5):

Since commit a2beb5f1efed ("mm: clean up the last pieces of page fault
accountings"), the local variable major is unused.  Remove it.
