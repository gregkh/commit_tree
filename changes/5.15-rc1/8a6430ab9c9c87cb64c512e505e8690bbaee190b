libata: add ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM for Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs

Commit ca6bfcb2f6d9 ("libata: Enable queued TRIM for Samsung SSD 860")
limited the existing ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk from "Samsung SSD 8*",
covering all Samsung 800 series SSDs, to only apply to "Samsung SSD 840*"
and "Samsung SSD 850*" series based on information from Samsung.

But there is a large number of users which is still reporting issues
with the Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs combined with Intel, ASmedia or
Marvell SATA controllers and all reporters also report these problems
going away when disabling queued trims.

Note that with AMD SATA controllers users are reporting even worse
issues and only completely disabling NCQ helps there, this will be
addressed in a separate patch.
