btrfs: sysfs: document structures and their associated files

Sysfs file has grown big. It takes some time to locate the correct
struct attribute to add new files. Create a table and map the struct
attribute to its sysfs path.

Also, fix the comment about the debug sysfs path.  And add the comments
to the attributes instead of attribute group, where sysfs file names are
defined.
