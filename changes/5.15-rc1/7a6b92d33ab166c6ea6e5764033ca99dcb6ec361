eventfd: Export eventfd_wake_count to modules

Export eventfd_wake_count so that some modules can use
the eventfd_signal_count() to check whether the
eventfd_signal() call should be deferred to a safe context.

NB(mst): this patch is not needed in Linus tree since there
eventfd_signal_count() has been superseded by an already exported
eventfd_signal_allowed().
