powerpc/kvm: Remove obsolete and unneeded select

Commit a278e7ea608b ("powerpc: Fix compile issue with force DAWR")
selects the non-existing config PPC_DAWR_FORCE_ENABLE for config
KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER. As this commit also introduces a config PPC_DAWR
and this config PPC_DAWR is selected with PPC if PPC64, there is no
need for any further select in the KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER.

Remove an obsolete and unneeded select in config KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER.

The issue was identified with ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py.
