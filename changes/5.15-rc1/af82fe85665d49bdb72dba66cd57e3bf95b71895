MIPS/jazzdma: return error code from jazz_dma_map_sg()

The .map_sg() op now expects an error code instead of zero on failure.

vdma_alloc() may fail for different reasons, but since it only supports
indicating an error via a return of DMA_MAPPING_ERROR, we coalesce the
different reasons into -EIO as is documented on dma_map_sgtable().
