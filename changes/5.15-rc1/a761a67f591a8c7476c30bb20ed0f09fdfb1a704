timekeeping: Distangle resume and clock-was-set events

Resuming timekeeping is a clock-was-set event and uses the clock-was-set
notification mechanism. This is in the way of making the clock-was-set
update for hrtimers selective so unnecessary IPIs are avoided when a CPU
base does not have timers queued which are affected by the clock setting.

Distangle it by invoking hrtimer_resume() on each unfreezing CPU and invoke
the new timerfd_resume() function from timekeeping_resume() which is the
only place where this is needed.

Rename hrtimer_resume() to hrtimer_resume_local() to reflect the change.

With this the clock_was_set*() functions are not longer required to IPI all
CPUs unconditionally and can get some smarts to avoid them.
