locktorture: Mark statistics data races

The lock_stress_stats structure's ->n_lock_fail and ->n_lock_acquired
fields are incremented and sampled locklessly using plain C-language
statements, which KCSAN objects to.  This commit therefore marks the
statistics gathering with data_race() to flag the intent.  While in
the area, this commit also reduces the number of accesses to the
->n_lock_acquired field, thus eliminating some possible check/use
confusion.
