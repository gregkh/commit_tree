drm/i915: Remove allow_alloc from i915_gem_object_get_sg*

This reverts the rest of 0edbb9ba1bfe ("drm/i915: Move cmd parser
pinning to execbuffer").  Now that the only user of i915_gem_object_get_sg
without allow_alloc has been removed, we can drop the parameter.  This
portion of the revert was broken into its own patch to aid review.
