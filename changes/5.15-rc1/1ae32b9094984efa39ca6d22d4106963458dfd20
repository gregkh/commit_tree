habanalabs: support hint addresses range reservation

Add support for pre-determined driver-reserved device VA address ranges.
This is needed for future ASIC support where some contents must be
mapped into these pre-determined ranges because the H/W will be
configured using these ranges.

In case the user asks to map a VA without a hint address, avoid
allocating the device VA from the reserved ranges.

Make sure the validation checks of the hint address take into account
situation where the DRAM page size is not pow of 2.
