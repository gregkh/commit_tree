block: cleanup the lockdep handling in *alloc_disk

Pass the lockdep name to the low-level __blk_alloc_disk helper and
hardcode the name for it given that the number of minors or node_id
are not very useful information.  While this passes a pointless
argument for non-lockdep builds that is not really an issue as
disk allocation is a probe time only slow path.
