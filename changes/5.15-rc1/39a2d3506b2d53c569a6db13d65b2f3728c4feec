dma-mapping: add a dma_init_global_coherent helper

Add a new helper to initialize the global coherent pool.  This both
cleans up the existing initialization which indirects through the
reserved_mem_ops that are normally only used for struct device, and
also allows using the global pool for non-devicetree architectures.
