drm/i915/guc: Provide mmio list to be saved/restored on engine reset

The driver must provide GuC with a list of mmio registers
that should be saved/restored during a GuC-based engine reset.
Unfortunately, the list must be dynamically allocated as its size is
variable. That means the driver must generate the list twice - once to
work out the size and a second time to actually save it.

v2:
 (Alan / CI)
  - GEN7_GT_MODE -> GEN6_GT_MODE to fix WA selftest failure
