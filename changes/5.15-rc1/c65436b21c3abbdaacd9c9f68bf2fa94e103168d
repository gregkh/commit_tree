scsi: lpfc: Call discovery state machine when handling PLOGI/ADISC completions

In the PLOGI and ADISC completion handling, the device removal event could
be skipped during some link errors. This could leave a stale node in UNUSED
state.  Driver unload would hang for a long time waiting for this node to
be freed.

Resolve by taking the following steps:

 - Always post ADISC completion events to discovery state machine upon
   ADISC completion.

 - In case of a completion error for PLOGI/ADISC, ensure that init refcount
   is dropped if not registered with transport.
