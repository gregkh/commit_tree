tools/memory-model: Document data_race(READ_ONCE())

It is possible to cause KCSAN to ignore marked accesses by applying
__no_kcsan to the function or applying data_race() to the marked accesses.
These approaches allow the developer to restrict compiler optimizations
while also causing KCSAN to ignore diagnostic accesses.

This commit therefore updates the documentation accordingly.
