fs: dlm: generic connect func

This patch adds a generic connect function for TCP and SCTP. If the
connect functionality differs from each other additional callbacks in
dlm_proto_ops were added. The sockopts callback handling will guarantee
that sockets created by connect() will use the same options as sockets
created by accept().
