scsi: block: Remove the remaining SG_IO-related fields from struct request_queue

Move the sg_timeout and sg_reserved_size fields into the bsg_device and
scsi_device structures as they have nothing to do with generic block I/O.
Note that these values are now separate for bsg vs. SCSI device node
access, but that just matches how /dev/sg vs the other nodes has always
behaved.
