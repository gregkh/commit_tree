mm, slub: restore irqs around calling new_slab()

allocate_slab() currently re-enables irqs before calling to the page allocator.
It depends on gfpflags_allow_blocking() to determine if it's safe to do so.
Now we can instead simply restore irq before calling it through new_slab().
The other caller early_kmem_cache_node_alloc() is unaffected by this.
