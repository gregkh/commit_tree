serial: 8250: Define RX trigger levels for OxSemi 950 devices

Oxford Semiconductor 950 serial port devices have a 128-byte FIFO and in
the enhanced (650) mode, which we select in `autoconfig_has_efr' with
the ECB bit set in the EFR register, they support the receive interrupt
trigger level selectable with FCR bits 7:6 from the set of 16, 32, 112,
120.  This applies to the original OX16C950 discrete UART[1] as well as
950 cores embedded into more complex devices.

For these devices we set the default to 112, which sets an excessively
high level of 112 or 7/8 of the FIFO capacity, unlike with other port
types where we choose at most 1/2 of their respective FIFO capacities.
Additionally we don't make the trigger level configurable.  Consequently
frequent input overruns happen with high bit rates where hardware flow
control cannot be used (e.g. terminal applications) even with otherwise
highly-performant systems.

Lower the default receive interrupt trigger level to 32 then, and make
it configurable.  Document the trigger levels along with other port
types, including the set of 16, 32, 64, 112 for the transmit interrupt
as well[2].
