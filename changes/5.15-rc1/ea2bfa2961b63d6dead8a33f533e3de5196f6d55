ALSA: wss: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in ISA wss driver with
devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is converted
with the corresponding devres helper.  Since the whole destructor code
could be removed by the conversion, the lowlevel snd_device was
dropped as well.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
