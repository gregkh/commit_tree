9p/xen: Fix end of loop tests for list_for_each_entry

This patch addresses the following problems:
 - priv can never be NULL, so this part of the check is useless
 - if the loop ran through the whole list, priv->client is invalid and
it is more appropriate and sufficient to check for the end of
list_for_each_entry loop condition.
