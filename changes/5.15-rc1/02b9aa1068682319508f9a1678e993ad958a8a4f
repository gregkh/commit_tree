bnxt_en: discard out of sequence HWRM responses

During firmware crash recovery, it is possible for firmware to respond
to stale HWRM commands that have already timed out. Because response
buffers may be reused, any out of sequence responses need to be ignored
and only the matching seq_id should be accepted.

Also, READ_ONCE should be used for the reads from the DMA buffer to
ensure that the necessary loads are scheduled.
