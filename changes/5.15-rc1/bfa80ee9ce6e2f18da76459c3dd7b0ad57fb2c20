irqchip/gic-v3: Add __gic_get_ppi_index() to find the PPI number from hwirq

gic_get_ppi_index() is a useful concept for ppi partitions, as the GIC
has two PPI ranges but needs mapping to a single range when used as an
index in the gic_data.ppi_descs[] array.

Add a double-underscore version which takes just the intid. This will
be used in the partition domain select and translate helpers to enable
partition support for the EPPI range.
