bpf: selftests: Add dctcp fallback test

This patch makes the bpf_dctcp test to fallback to cubic by
using setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION) when the tcp flow is not
ecn ready.

It also checks setsockopt() is not available to release().

The settimeo() from the network_helpers.h is used, so the local
one is removed.
