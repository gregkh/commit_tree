dt-bindings: mtd: gpmc: Fix the ECC bytes vs. OOB bytes equation

"PAGESIZE / 512" is the number of ECC chunks.
"ECC_BYTES" is the number of bytes needed to store a single ECC code.
"2" is the space reserved by the bad block marker.

"2 + (PAGESIZE / 512) * ECC_BYTES" should of course be lower or equal
than the total number of OOB bytes, otherwise it won't fit.

Fix the equation by substituting s/>=/<=/.
