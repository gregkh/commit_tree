serial: sh-sci: fix break handling for sysrq

This fixes two issues that cause the sysrq sequence to be inadvertently
aborted on SCIF serial consoles:

- a NUL character remains in the RX queue after a break has been detected,
  which is then passed on to uart_handle_sysrq_char()
- the break interrupt is handled twice on controllers with multiplexed ERI
  and BRI interrupts
