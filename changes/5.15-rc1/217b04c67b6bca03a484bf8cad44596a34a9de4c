serial: stm32: fix the conditional expression writing

In the function stm32_usart_init_port, intent of the code maybe when
irq returns a value of zero, the return should be '-ENODEV'. But the
conditional expression '? :' maybe clerical error, it should be
'?:' to make '-ENODEV' work.
But in fact, as the example in platform.c is
  * int irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 0);
  * if (irq < 0)
  * return irq;
So the return value of zero is unnecessary to check, at last remove
the unnecessary '?: -ENODEV'.
