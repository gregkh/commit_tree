staging: rtl8723bs: do some code cleaning in modified function

do some code cleaning after changes of previous commit.
Fixed comments, camel case names, variable naming conventions;
kept function names without chip series numbers (this is
just code for 8723), fixed indentations, blank lines and
other minor stuff.
