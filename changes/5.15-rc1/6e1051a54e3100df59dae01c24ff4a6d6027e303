samples: bpf: Convert xdp_monitor to XDP samples helper

Use the libbpf skeleton facility and other utilities provided by XDP
samples helper.

A lot of the code in xdp_monitor and xdp_redirect_cpu has been moved to
the xdp_sample_user.o helper, so we remove the duplicate functions here
that are no longer needed.

Thanks to BPF skeleton, we no longer depend on order of tracepoints to
uninstall them on startup. Instead, the sample mask is used to install
the needed tracepoints.
