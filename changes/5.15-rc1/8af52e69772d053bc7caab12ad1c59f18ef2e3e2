tools build: Fix feature detect clean for out of source builds

Currently the clean target when using O= isn't cleaning the feature
detect output. This is because O= and OUTPUT= are set to canonical
paths. For example in tools/perf/Makefile:

  FULL_O := $(shell cd $(PWD); readlink -f $(O) || echo $(O))

This means that OUTPUT ends in a / and most usages prepend it to a file
without adding an extra /. This line that was changed adds an extra /
before the 'feature' folder but not to the end, resulting in a clean
command like this:

  rm -f /tmp/build//featuretest-all.bin ...

After the change the clean command looks like this:

  rm -f /tmp/build/feature/test-all.bin ...
