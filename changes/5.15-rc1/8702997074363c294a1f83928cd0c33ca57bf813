netfilter: nf_queue: move hookfn registration out of struct net

This was done to detect when the pernet->init() function was not called
yet, by checking if net->nf.queue_handler is NULL.

Once the nfnetlink_queue module is active, all struct net pointers
contain the same address.  So place this back in nf_queue.c.

Handle the 'netns error unwind' test by checking nfnl_queue_net for a
NULL pointer and add a comment for this.
