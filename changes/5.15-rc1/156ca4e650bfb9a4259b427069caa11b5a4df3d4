powerpc: remove unused zInstall target from arch/powerpc/boot/Makefile

Commit c913e5f95e54 ("powerpc/boot: Don't install zImage.* from make
install") added the zInstall target to arch/powerpc/boot/Makefile,
but you cannot use it since the corresponding hook is missing in
arch/powerpc/Makefile.

It has never worked since its addition. Nobody has complained about
it for 7 years, which means this code was unneeded.

With this removal, the install.sh will be passed in with 4 parameters.
Simplify the shell script.
