ALSA: usb-audio: Move txfr_quirk handling to quirk_flags

The txfr_quirk field was meant for aligning the transfer, and it's set
for certain devices in quirks-table.h.  Now we can move that stuff
also to the new quirk_flags gracefully, and reduce the quirks-table.h
entries (that are exposed to module device table).

As the quirks-table.h entries are also with the name string override,
provide the corresponding entries to the usb_audio_names[] table,
too.
