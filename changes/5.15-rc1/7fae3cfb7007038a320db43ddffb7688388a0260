soundwire: bus: squelch error returned by mockup devices

All read and writes from/to SoundWire mockup devices will return
-ENODATA/Command_Ignored, this patch forces a Command_OK result to let
the bus perform the required configurations, e.g. for the Data Ports,
which will only have an effect on the Master side.
