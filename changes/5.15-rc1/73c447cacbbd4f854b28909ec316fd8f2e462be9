net: dsa: mt7530: always install FDB entries with IVL and FID 1

This reverts commit 7e777021780e ("mt7530 mt7530_fdb_write only set ivl
bit vid larger than 1").

Before this series, the default value of all ports' PVID is 1, which is
copied into the FDB entry, even if the ports are VLAN unaware. So
`bridge fdb show` will show entries like `dev swp0 vlan 1 self` even on
a VLAN-unaware bridge.

The blamed commit does not solve that issue completely, instead it may
cause a new issue that FDB is inaccessible in a VLAN-aware bridge with
PVID 1.

This series sets PVID to 0 on VLAN-unaware ports, so `bridge fdb show`
will no longer print `vlan 1` on VLAN-unaware bridges, and that special
case in fdb_write is not required anymore.

Set FDB entries' filter ID to 1 to match the VLAN table.
