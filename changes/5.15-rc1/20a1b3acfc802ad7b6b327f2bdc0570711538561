i2c: acpi: Add an i2c_acpi_client_count() helper function

We have 3 files now which have the need to count the number of
I2cSerialBus resources in an ACPI-device's resource-list.

Currently all implement their own helper function for this,
add a generic helper function to replace the 3 implementations.
