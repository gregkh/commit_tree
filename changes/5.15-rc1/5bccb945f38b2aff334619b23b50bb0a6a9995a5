drm/msm/disp/dpu1: add safe lut config in dpu driver

Add safe lut configuration for all the targets in dpu
driver as per QOS recommendation.

Issue reported on SC7280:

With wait-for-safe feature in smmu enabled, RT client
buffer levels are checked to be safe before smmu invalidation.
Since display was always set to unsafe it was delaying the
invalidaiton process thus impacting the performance on NRT clients
such as eMMC and NVMe.

Validated this change on SC7280, With this change eMMC performance
has improved significantly.

Changes in v2:
- Add fixes tag (Sai)
- CC stable kernel (Dimtry)

Changes in v3:
- Correct fixes tag with appropriate hash (stephen)
- Resend patch adding reviewed by tag
- Resend patch adding correct format for pushing into stable tree (Greg)
