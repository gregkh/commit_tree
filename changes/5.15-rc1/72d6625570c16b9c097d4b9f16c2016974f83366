habanalabs: modify multi-CS to wait on stream masters

During the integration, the multi-CS requirements were refined:
- The multi CS call shall wait on "per-ASIC" predefined stream masters
  instead of set of streams.
- Stream masters are set of QIDs used by the upper SW layers (synapse)
  for completion (must be an external/HW queue).
