Drivers: hv: Move Hyper-V misc functionality to arch-neutral code

The check for whether hibernation is possible, and the enabling of
Hyper-V panic notification during kexec, are both architecture neutral.
Move the code from under arch/x86 and into drivers/hv/hv_common.c where
it can also be used for ARM64.

No functional change.
