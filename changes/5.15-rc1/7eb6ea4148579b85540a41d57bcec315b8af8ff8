PCI: Fix pci_dev_str_match_path() alloc while atomic bug

pci_dev_str_match_path() is often called with a spinlock held so the
allocation has to be atomic.  The call tree is:

  pci_specified_resource_alignment() <-- takes spin_lock();
    pci_dev_str_match()
      pci_dev_str_match_path()

Fixes: 45db33709ccc ("PCI: Allow specifying devices using a base bus and path of devfns")
