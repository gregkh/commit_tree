xfs: pass a CIL context to xlog_write()

Pass the CIL context to xlog_write() rather than a pointer to a LSN
variable. Only the CIL checkpoint calls to xlog_write() need to know
about the start LSN of the writes, so rework xlog_write to directly
write the LSNs into the CIL context structure.

This removes the commit_lsn variable from xlog_cil_push_work(), so
now we only have to issue the commit record ordering wakeup from
there.
