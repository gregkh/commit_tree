drm/vc4: hdmi: Rely on interrupts to handle hotplug

DRM currently polls for the HDMI connector status every 10s, which can
be an issue when we connect/disconnect a display quickly or the device
on the other end only issues a hotplug pulse (for example on EDID
change).

Switch the driver to rely on the internal controller logic for the
BCM2711/RPi4.
