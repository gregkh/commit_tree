bpf, tests: Add tail call test suite

While BPF_CALL instructions were tested implicitly by the cBPF-to-eBPF
translation, there has not been any tests for BPF_TAIL_CALL instructions.
The new test suite includes tests for tail call chaining, tail call count
tracking and error paths. It is mainly intended for JIT development and
testing.
