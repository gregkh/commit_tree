clk: mediatek: Add configurable enable control to mtk_pll_data

In all MediaTek PLL design, bit0 of CON0 register is always
the enable bit.
However, there's a special case of usbpll on MT8192.
The enable bit of usbpll is moved to bit2 of other register.
Add configurable en_reg and pll_en_bit for enable control or
default 0 where pll data are static variables.
Hence, CON0_BASE_EN could also be removed.
And there might have another special case on other chips,
the enable bit is still on CON0 register but not at bit0.
