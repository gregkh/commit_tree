btrfs: zoned: fix double counting of split ordered extent

btrfs_add_ordered_extent_*() add num_bytes to fs_info->ordered_bytes.
Then, splitting an ordered extent will call btrfs_add_ordered_extent_*()
again for split extents, leading to double counting of the region of
a split extent. These leaked bytes are finally reported at unmount time
as follow:

  BTRFS info (device dm-1): at unmount dio bytes count 364544

Fix the double counting by subtracting split extent's size from
fs_info->ordered_bytes.
