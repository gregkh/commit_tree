usb: gadget: f_hid: optional SETUP/SET_REPORT mode

f_hid provides the OUT Endpoint as only way for receiving reports
from the host. SETUP/SET_REPORT method is not supported, and this causes
a number of compatibility problems with various host drivers, especially
in the case of keyboard emulation using f_hid.

  - Some hosts do not support the OUT Endpoint and ignore it,
    so it becomes impossible for the gadget to receive a report
    from the host. In the case of a keyboard, the gadget loses
    the ability to receive the status of the LEDs.

  - Some BIOSes/UEFIs can't work with HID devices with the OUT Endpoint
    at all. This may be due to their bugs or incomplete implementation
    of the HID standard.
    For example, absolutely all Apple UEFIs can't handle the OUT Endpoint
    if it goes after IN Endpoint in the descriptor and require the reverse
    order (OUT, IN) which is a violation of the standard.
    Other hosts either do not initialize gadgets with a descriptor
    containing the OUT Endpoint completely (like some HP and DELL BIOSes
    and embedded firmwares like on KVM switches), or initialize them,
    but will not poll the IN Endpoint.

This patch adds configfs option no_out_endpoint=1 to disable
the OUT Endpoint and allows f_hid to receive reports from the host
via SETUP/SET_REPORT.

Previously, there was such a feature in f_hid, but it was replaced
by the OUT Endpoint [1] in the commit 99c515005857 ("usb: gadget: hidg:
register OUT INT endpoint for SET_REPORT"). So this patch actually
returns the removed functionality while making it optional.
For backward compatibility reasons, the OUT Endpoint mode remains
the default behaviour.

  - The OUT Endpoint mode provides the report queue and reduces
    USB overhead (eliminating SETUP routine) on transmitting a report
    from the host.

  - If the SETUP/SET_REPORT mode is used, there is no report queue,
    so the userspace will only read last report. For classic HID devices
    like keyboards this is not a problem, since it's intended to transmit
    the status of the LEDs and only the last report is important.
    This mode provides better compatibility with strange and buggy
    host drivers.

Both modes passed USBCV tests. Checking with the USB protocol analyzer
also confirmed that everything is working as it should and the new mode
ensures operability in all of the described cases.
