drm/dp: Move panel DP AUX backlight support to drm_dp_helper

We were getting a depmod error:
  depmod: ERROR: Cycle detected: drm_kms_helper -> drm -> drm_kms_helper

It looks like the rule is that drm_kms_helper can call into drm, but
drm can't call into drm_kms_helper. That means we've got to move the
DP AUX backlight support into drm_dp_helper.

NOTE: as part of this, I didn't try to do any renames of the main
registration function. Even though it's in the drm_dp_helper, it still
feels very parallel to drm_panel_of_backlight().
