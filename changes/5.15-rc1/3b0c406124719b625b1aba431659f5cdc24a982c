tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit

This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct
containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel
with values.

If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the
vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),
leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to
the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to
fbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a
wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes
the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.

To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called
even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will
"fix and fill" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.
