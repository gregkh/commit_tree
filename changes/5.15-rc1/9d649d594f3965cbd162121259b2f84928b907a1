RDMA/siw: Convert siw_tx_hdt() to kmap_local_page()

kmap() is being deprecated and will break uses of device dax after PKS
protection is introduced.[1]

The use of kmap() in siw_tx_hdt() is all thread local therefore
kmap_local_page() is a sufficient replacement and will work with pgmap
protected pages when those are implemented.

siw_tx_hdt() tracks pages used in a page_array.  It uses that array to
unmap pages which were mapped on function exit.  Not all entries in the
array are mapped and this is tracked in kmap_mask.

kunmap_local() takes a mapped address rather than a page.  Alter
siw_unmap_pages() to take the iov array to reuse the iov_base address of
each mapping.  Use PAGE_MASK to get the proper address for kunmap_local().

kmap_local_page() mappings are tracked in a stack and must be unmapped in
the opposite order they were mapped in.  Because segments are mapped into
the page array in increasing index order, modify siw_unmap_pages() to
unmap pages in decreasing order.

Use kmap_local_page() instead of kmap() to map pages in the page_array.
