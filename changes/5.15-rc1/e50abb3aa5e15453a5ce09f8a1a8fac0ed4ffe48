MAINTAINERS: update STAGING - REALTEK RTL8188EU DRIVERS

Commit 55dfa29b43d2 ("staging: rtl8188eu: remove rtl8188eu driver from
staging dir") removes ./drivers/staging/rtl8188eu, but misses to adjust
the STAGING - REALTEK RTL8188EU DRIVERS section in MAINTAINERS.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  no file matches    F:    drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/

A refurnished rtl8188eu driver is available in ./drivers/staging/r8188eu/
and there is no existing section in MAINTAINERS for that directory.

So, reuse the STAGING - REALTEK RTL8188EU DRIVERS section and point to the
refurnished driver with its current developers and maintainers according
to the current git log.
