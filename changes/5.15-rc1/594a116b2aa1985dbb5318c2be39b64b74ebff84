samples: bpf: Convert xdp_redirect_map_multi to XDP samples helper

Use the libbpf skeleton facility and other utilities provided by XDP
samples helper. Also adapt to change of type of mac address map, so that
no resizing is required.

Add a new flag for sample mask that skips priting the
from_device->to_device heading for each line, as xdp_redirect_map_multi
may have two devices but the flow of data may be bidirectional, so the
output would be confusing.
