netfilter: socket: icmp6: fix use-after-scope

Bug reported by KASAN:

BUG: KASAN: use-after-scope in inet6_ehashfn (net/ipv6/inet6_hashtables.c:40)
Call Trace:
(...)
inet6_ehashfn (net/ipv6/inet6_hashtables.c:40)
(...)
nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6 (net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_socket_ipv6.c:91
net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_socket_ipv6.c:146)

It seems that this bug has already been fixed by Eric Dumazet in the
past in:
commit 78296c97ca1f ("netfilter: xt_socket: fix a stack corruption bug")

But a variant of the same issue has been introduced in
commit d64d80a2cde9 ("netfilter: x_tables: don't extract flow keys on early demuxed sks in socket match")

`daddr` and `saddr` potentially hold a reference to ipv6_var that is no
longer in scope when the call to `nf_socket_get_sock_v6` is made.

Fixes: d64d80a2cde9 ("netfilter: x_tables: don't extract flow keys on early demuxed sks in socket match")
