f2fs: extent cache: support unaligned extent

Compressed inode may suffer read performance issue due to it can not
use extent cache, so I propose to add this unaligned extent support
to improve it.

Currently, it only works in readonly format f2fs image.

Unaligned extent: in one compressed cluster, physical block number
will be less than logical block number, so we add an extra physical
block length in extent info in order to indicate such extent status.

The idea is if one whole cluster blocks are contiguous physically,
once its mapping info was readed at first time, we will cache an
unaligned (or aligned) extent info entry in extent cache, it expects
that the mapping info will be hitted when rereading cluster.

Merge policy:
- Aligned extents can be merged.
- Aligned extent and unaligned extent can not be merged.
