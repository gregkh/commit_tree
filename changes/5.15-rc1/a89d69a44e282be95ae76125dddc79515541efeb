mtd: mtdconcat: Check _read, _write callbacks existence before assignment

Since 2431c4f5b46c3 ("mtd: Implement mtd_{read,write}() as wrappers
around mtd_{read,write}_oob()") don't allow _write|_read and
_write_oob|_read_oob existing at the same time, we should check the
existence of callbacks "_read and _write" from subdev's master device
(We can trust master device since it has been registered) before
assigning, otherwise following warning occurs while making
concatenated device:

  WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 6728 at drivers/mtd/mtdcore.c:595
  add_mtd_device+0x7f/0x7b0

Fixes: 2431c4f5b46c3 ("mtd: Implement mtd_{read,write}() around ...")
