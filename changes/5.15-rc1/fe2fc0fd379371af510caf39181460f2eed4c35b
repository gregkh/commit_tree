ARM: dts: ux500: Adjust operating points to reality

The operating points should correspond to the actual frequencies
supported for the CPU. Other patches have fixed so these are
rounded and reported properly, this fixes the device trees to
match.

The Codina variant has a lower frequency than other devices so
indicate this in the device tree.
