cifs: Do not leak EDEADLK to dgetents64 for STATUS_USER_SESSION_DELETED

RHBZ: 1994393

If we hit a STATUS_USER_SESSION_DELETED for the Create part in the
Create/QueryDirectory compound that starts a directory scan
we will leak EDEADLK back to userspace and surprise glibc and the application.

Pick this up initiate_cifs_search() and retry a small number of tries before we
return an error to userspace.
