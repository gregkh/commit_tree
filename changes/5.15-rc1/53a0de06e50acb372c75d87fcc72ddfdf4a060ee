mm, slub: dissolve new_slab_objects() into ___slab_alloc()

The later patches will need more fine grained control over individual actions
in ___slab_alloc(), the only caller of new_slab_objects(), so dissolve it
there. This is a preparatory step with no functional change.

The only minor change is moving WARN_ON_ONCE() for using a constructor together
with __GFP_ZERO to new_slab(), which makes it somewhat less frequent, but still
able to catch a development change introducing a systematic misuse.
