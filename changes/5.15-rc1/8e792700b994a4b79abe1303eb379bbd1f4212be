net/mlx5: Delete impossible dev->state checks

New mlx5_core device structure is allocated through devlink_alloc
with\ kzalloc and that ensures that all fields are equal to zero
and it includes ->state too.

That means that checks of that field in the mlx5_init_one() is
completely redundant, because that function is called only once
in the begging of mlx5_core_dev lifetime.

PCI:
 .probe()
  -> probe_one()
   -> mlx5_init_one()

The recovery flow can't run at that time or before it, because relevant
work initialized later in mlx5_init_once().

Such initialization flow ensures that dev->state can't be
MLX5_DEVICE_STATE_UNINITIALIZED at all, so remove such impossible
checks.
