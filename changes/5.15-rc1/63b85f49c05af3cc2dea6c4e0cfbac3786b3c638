net/mlx5: DR, Add ignore_flow_level support for multi-dest flow tables

When creating an FTE, we might need to create multi-destination flow table,
which is eventually created by FW. In such case, this FW table should
include all the FTE properties as requested by the upper layer, including
the ability to point to another flow table with level lower or equal to
the current table - indicated by the "ignore_flow_level" property.
