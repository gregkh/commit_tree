s390: use generic strncpy/strnlen from_user

The s390 variant of strncpy_from_user() is slightly faster than the
generic variant, however convert to the generic variant now to follow
most if not all other architectures.

Converting to the generic variant was already considered a couple of
years ago. See commit f5c8b9601036 ("s390/uaccess: use sane length for
__strncpy_from_user()").
