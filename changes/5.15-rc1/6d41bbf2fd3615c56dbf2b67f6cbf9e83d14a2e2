ASoC: Intel: kbl_da7219_max98927: Fix format selection for max98373

Contrary to what is said in board's file, topology targeting
kbl_da7219_max98373 expects format 16b, not 24/32b. Partially revert
changes added in 'ASoC: Intel: Boards: Add Maxim98373 support' to bring
old behavior back, aligning with topology expectations.
