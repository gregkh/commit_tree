powerpc/svm: Don't issue ultracalls if !mem_encrypt_active()

Commit ad6c00283163 ("swiotlb: Free tbl memory in swiotlb_exit()")
introduced a set_memory_encrypted() call to swiotlb_exit() so that the
buffer pages are returned to an encrypted state prior to being freed.

Sachin reports that this leads to the following crash on a Power server:

[    0.010799] software IO TLB: tearing down default memory pool
[    0.010805] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[    0.010808] kernel BUG at arch/powerpc/kernel/interrupt.c:98!

Nick spotted that this is because set_memory_encrypted() is issuing an
ultracall which doesn't exist for the processor, and should therefore
be gated by mem_encrypt_active() to mirror the x86 implementation.
