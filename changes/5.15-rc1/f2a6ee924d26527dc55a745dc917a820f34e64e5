selftests/bpf: Add tests for {set|get} socket option from setsockopt BPF

Adding selftests for the newly added functionality to call bpf_setsockopt()
and bpf_getsockopt() from setsockopt BPF programs.

Test Details:

1. BPF Program

   Checks for changes in IPV6_TCLASS(SOL_IPV6) via setsockopt
   If the cca for the socket is not cubic do nothing
   If the newly set value for IPV6_TCLASS is 45 (0x2d) (as per our use-case)
   then change the cc from cubic to reno

2. User Space Program

   Creates an AF_INET6 socket and set the cca for that to be "cubic"
   Attach the program and set the IPV6_TCLASS to 0x2d using setsockopt
   Verify the cca for the socket changed to reno
