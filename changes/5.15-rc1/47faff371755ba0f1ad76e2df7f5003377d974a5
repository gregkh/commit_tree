libbpf: Add bpf_cookie to perf_event, kprobe, uprobe, and tp attach APIs

Wire through bpf_cookie for all attach APIs that use perf_event_open under the
hood:
  - for kprobes, extend existing bpf_kprobe_opts with bpf_cookie field;
  - for perf_event, uprobe, and tracepoint APIs, add their _opts variants and
    pass bpf_cookie through opts.

For kernel that don't support BPF_LINK_CREATE for perf_events, and thus
bpf_cookie is not supported either, return error and log warning for user.
