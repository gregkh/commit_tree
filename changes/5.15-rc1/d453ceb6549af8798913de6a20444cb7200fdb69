platform/chrome: sensorhub: Add trace events for sample

Add trace event to report samples and their timestamp coming from the
EC. It allows to check if the timestamps are correct and the filter is
working correctly without introducing too much latency.

To enable these events:

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo 1 > events/cros_ec/enable
echo 0 > events/cros_ec/cros_ec_request_start/enable
echo 0 > events/cros_ec/cros_ec_request_done/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
cat trace_pipe
Observe event flowing:
irq/105-chromeo-95      [000] ....   613.659758: cros_ec_sensorhub_timestamp: ...
irq/105-chromeo-95      [000] ....   613.665219: cros_ec_sensorhub_filter: dx: ...
