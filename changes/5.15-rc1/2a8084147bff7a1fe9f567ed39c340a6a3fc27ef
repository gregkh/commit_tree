iwlwifi: acpi: support reading and storing WRDS revision 1 and 2

Change the SAR profile tables storage to revision 2 regardless of the
revision we read from ACPI.  Revision 2 is a superset of revision 1,
which is in turn a superset of revision 0, so they can all be stored
inside revision 2.

Add support for reading and storing also revisions 1 and 2, whose only
difference is the number of chains and number of sub-bands.  So most
of the code revolves around passing different chain and sub-band
sizes.

With this patch we still pass only revision 0 to the firmware, but
that will be changed in a separate patch.
