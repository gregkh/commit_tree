Bluetooth: increase BTNAMSIZ to 21 chars to fix potential buffer overflow

An earlier commit replaced using batostr to using %pMR sprintf for the
construction of session->name. Static analysis detected that this new
method can use a total of 21 characters (including the trailing '\0')
so we need to increase the BTNAMSIZ from 18 to 21 to fix potential
buffer overflows.
