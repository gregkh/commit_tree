usb: ehci-orion: Handle errors of clk_prepare_enable() in probe

ehci_orion_drv_probe() did not account for possible errors of
clk_prepare_enable() that in particular could cause invocation of
clk_disable_unprepare() on clocks that were not prepared/enabled yet,
e.g. in remove or on handling errors of usb_add_hcd() in probe. Though,
there were several patches fixing different issues with clocks in this
driver, they did not solve this problem.

Add handling of errors of clk_prepare_enable() in ehci_orion_drv_probe()
to avoid calls of clk_disable_unprepare() without previous successful
invocation of clk_prepare_enable().
