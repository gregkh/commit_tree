drm/amd/display: Fix ASSR regression on embedded panels

[Why]
Regression found in some embedded panels traces back to the earliest
upstreamed ASSR patch. The changed code flow are causing problems
with some panels.

[How]
- Change ASSR enabling code while preserving original code flow
  as much as possible
- Simplify the code on guarding with internal display flag
