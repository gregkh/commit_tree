powerpc/64s/perf: Always use SIAR for kernel interrupts

If an interrupt is taken in kernel mode, always use SIAR for it rather than
looking at regs_sipr. This prevents samples piling up around interrupt
enable (hard enable or interrupt replay via soft enable) in PMUs / modes
where the PR sample indication is not in synch with SIAR.

This results in better sampling of interrupt entry and exit in particular.
