clk: mediatek: Fix asymmetrical PLL enable and disable control

In fact, the en_mask is a combination of divider enable mask
and pll enable bit(bit0).
Before this patch, we enabled both divider mask and bit0 in prepare(),
but only cleared the bit0 in unprepare().
In the future, we hope en_mask will only be used as divider enable mask.
The enable register(CON0) will be set in 2 steps:
first is divider mask, and then bit0 during prepare(), and vice versa.
But considering backward compatibility, at this stage we allow en_mask
to be a combination or a pure divider enable mask.
And then we will make en_mask a pure divider enable mask in another
following patch series.
