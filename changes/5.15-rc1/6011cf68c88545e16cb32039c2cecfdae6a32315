KVM: arm64: Walk userspace page tables to compute the THP mapping size

We currently rely on the kvm_is_transparent_hugepage() helper to
discover whether a given page has the potential to be mapped as
a block mapping.

However, this API doesn't really give un everything we want:
- we don't get the size: this is not crucial today as we only
  support PMD-sized THPs, but we'd like to have larger sizes
  in the future
- we're the only user left of the API, and there is a will
  to remove it altogether

To address the above, implement a simple walker using the existing
page table infrastructure, and plumb it into transparent_hugepage_adjust().
No new page sizes are supported in the process.
