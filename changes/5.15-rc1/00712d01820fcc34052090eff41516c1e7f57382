selftests/sync: Remove the deprecated config SYNC

SYNC was removed since
aff9da10e21 ("staging/android: make sync_timeline internal to sw_sync")
LKP/0Day will check if all configs listing under selftests are able to
be enabled properly.

For the missing configs, it will report something like:
LKP WARN miss config CONFIG_SYNC= of sync/config

- it's not reasonable to keep the deprecated configs.
- configs under kselftests are recommended by corresponding tests.
So if some configs are missing, it will impact the testing results
