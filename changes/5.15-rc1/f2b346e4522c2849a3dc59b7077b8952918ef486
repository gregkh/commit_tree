shmem: remove unneeded variable ret

Patch series "Cleanups for shmem".

This series contains cleanups to remove unneeded variable, header file,
function forward declaration and so on.  More details can be found in the
respective changelogs.

This patch (of 4):

The local variable ret is always equal to -ENOMEM and never touched.  So
remove it and return -ENOMEM directly to simplify the code.
