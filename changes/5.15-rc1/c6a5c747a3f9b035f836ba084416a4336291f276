scsi: lpfc: Add MIB feature enablement support

MIB support is currently limited to detecting support in the adapter and
ensuring FDMI support is enabled if present.  For the new framework MIB
support also requires active enablement of support via the SET_FEATURES
command with the firmware.

Rework the MIB detection and enablement for the following:

 - Move detection away from the get_sli4_parameters routine, and into the
   hba_setup path. get_sli4_parameters is only called once at attachment
   while hba_setup is called as part of any SLI port reset path. This
   ensures detection after firmware download.

 - Update SET_FEATURES mbx command for the MIB enablement feature and add
   support for the feature.

 - Create the cmf_setup routine to encapsulate the detection of MIB support
   and perform the enablement of the MIB support feature.
