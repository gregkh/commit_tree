dm ima: measure data on device remove

Presence of an active block-device, configured with expected parameters,
is important for an external attestation service to determine if a system
meets the attestation requirements.  Therefore it is important for DM to
measure the device remove events.

Measure device parameters and table hashes when the device is removed,
using either remove or remove_all.
