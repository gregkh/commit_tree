net/mlx5: Lag, Create shared FDB when in switchdev mode

If both eswitches are in switchdev mode and the uplink representors
are enslaved to the same bond device create a shared FDB configuration.

When moving to shared FDB mode not only the hardware needs be configured
but the RDMA driver needs to reconfigure itself.

When such change is done, unload the RDMA devices, configure the hardware
and load the RDMA representors.

When destroying the lag (can happen if a PCI function is unbinded,
driver is unloaded or by just removing a netdev from the bond) make sure
to restore the system to the previous state only if possible.

For example, if a PCI function is unbinded there is no need to load the
representors as the device is going away.
