habanalabs: re-init completion object upon retry

In case user interrupt arrived but the completion value is less than
the target value, we want to retry the wait.

However, before the retry we must reinitialize the completion object,
under spin-lock, so the wait function won't exit immediately because
the completion object is already completed (from the previous
interrupt).
