NFSv4/pNFS: Remove dead code

Since commit 2b28a7bee453 ("fs, nfs: convert
pnfs_layout_hdr.plh_refcount from atomic_t to refcount_t") it has not
been legal to bump a zero refcount, so the code that tries to allow it
if the NFS_LSEG_VALID flag is still set would cause trouble. Luckily,
NFS_LSEG_VALID has its own refcount so we can never hit this bad code
snippet in practice. Remove it to avoid confusion.
