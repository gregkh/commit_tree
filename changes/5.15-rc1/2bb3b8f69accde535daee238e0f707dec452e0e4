iio: temperature: tmp006: convert probe to device-managed

This change converts the driver to register via devm_iio_device_register().
For the tmp006_powerdown() hook, this uses a devm_add_action() hook to put
the device in powerdown mode when it's unregistered.

With these changes, the remove hook can be removed.

The i2c_set_clientdata() call is staying around as the private data is used
in the PM routines.
