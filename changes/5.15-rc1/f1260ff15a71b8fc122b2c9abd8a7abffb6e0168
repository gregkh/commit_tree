skbuff: introduce skb_expand_head()

Like skb_realloc_headroom(), new helper increases headroom of specified skb.
Unlike skb_realloc_headroom(), it does not allocate a new skb if possible;
copies skb->sk on new skb when as needed and frees original skb in case
of failures.

This helps to simplify ip[6]_finish_output2() and a few other similar cases.
