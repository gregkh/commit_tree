KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Reflect guest PMU in-use to L0 when guest SPRs are live

After the L1 saves its PMU SPRs but before loading the L2's PMU SPRs,
switch the pmcregs_in_use field in the L1 lppaca to the value advertised
by the L2 in its VPA. On the way out of the L2, set it back after saving
the L2 PMU registers (if they were in-use).

This transfers the PMU liveness indication between the L1 and L2 at the
points where the registers are not live.

This fixes the nested HV bug for which a workaround was added to the L0
HV by commit 63279eeb7f93a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Always save guest pmu
for guest capable of nesting"), which explains the problem in detail.
That workaround is no longer required for guests that include this bug
fix.
