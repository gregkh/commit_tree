iwlwifi: fw: fix debug dump data declarations

The debug dump ranges aren't just an array of such ranges
since each range has a variable size. Therefore, the use
of a struct array is misleading at best.

Change it to be a u8 data[] instead of the struct array,
the code doesn't significantly change since it's actually
doing things correctly now.
