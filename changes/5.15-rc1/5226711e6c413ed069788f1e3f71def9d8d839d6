drm/vc4: Convert to Linux IRQ interfaces

Drop the DRM IRQ midlayer in favor of Linux IRQ interfaces. DRM's
IRQ helpers are mostly useful for UMS drivers. Modern KMS drivers
don't benefit from using it.

DRM IRQ callbacks are now being called directly or inlined.

Calls to platform_get_irq() can fail with a negative errno code.
Abort initialization in this case. The DRM IRQ midlayer does not
handle this case correctly.
