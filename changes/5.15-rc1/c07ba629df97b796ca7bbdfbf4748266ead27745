tools: bpftool: Update and synchronise option list in doc and help msg

All bpftool commands support the options for JSON output and debug from
libbpf. In addition, some commands support additional options
corresponding to specific use cases.

The list of options described in the man pages for the different
commands are not always accurate. The messages for interactive help are
mostly limited to HELP_SPEC_OPTIONS, and are even less representative of
the actual set of options supported for the commands.

Let's update the lists:

- HELP_SPEC_OPTIONS is modified to contain the "default" options (JSON
  and debug), and to be extensible (no ending curly bracket).
- All commands use HELP_SPEC_OPTIONS in their help message, and then
  complete the list with their specific options.
- The lists of options in the man pages are updated.
- The formatting of the list for bpftool.rst is adjusted to match
  formatting for the other man pages. This is for consistency, and also
  because it will be helpful in a future patch to automatically check
  that the files are synchronised.
