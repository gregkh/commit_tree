staging: r8188eu: use proper way to build a module

It seems that for now, we can only build this driver as a module.

Use the same mechanism as other drivers (such as rtl8723bs or the
deprecated rtl8188eu) to enforce building as a module, i.e. depend on m
in Kconfig instead of setting CONFIG_R8188EU = m in the Makefile.

If we set CONFIG_R8188EU in the Makefile, this setting will not be visible
in .config.
