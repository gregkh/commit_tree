RDMA/rdmavt: Decouple QP and SGE lists allocations

The rdmavt QP has fields that are both needed for the control and data
path. Such mixed declaration caused to the very specific allocation flow
with kzalloc_node and SGE list embedded into the struct rvt_qp.

This patch separates QP creation to two: regular memory allocation for the
control path and specific code for the SGE list, while the access to the
later is performed through derefenced pointer.

Such pointer and its context are expected to be in the cache, so
performance difference is expected to be negligible, if any exists.
