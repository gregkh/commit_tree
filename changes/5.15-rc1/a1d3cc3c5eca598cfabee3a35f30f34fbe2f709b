libbpf: Avoid use of __int128 in typed dump display

__int128 is not supported for some 32-bit platforms (arm and i386).
__int128 was used in carrying out computations on bitfields which
aid display, but the same calculations could be done with __u64
with the small effect of not supporting 128-bit bitfields.

With these changes, a big-endian issue with casting 128-bit integers
to 64-bit for enum bitfields is solved also, as we now use 64-bit
integers for bitfield calculations.
