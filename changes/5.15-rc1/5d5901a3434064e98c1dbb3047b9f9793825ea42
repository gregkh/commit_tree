io_uring: remove submission references

Requests are by default given with two references, submission and
completion. Completion references are straightforward, they represent
request ownership and are put when a request is completed or so.
Submission references are a bit more trickier. They're needed when
io_issue_sqe() followed deep into the submission stack (e.g. in fs,
block, drivers, etc.), request may have given away for concurrent
execution or already completed, and the code unwinding back to
io_issue_sqe() may be accessing some pieces of our requests, e.g.
file or iov.

Now, we prevent such async/in-depth completions by pushing requests
through task_work. Punting to io-wq is also done through task_works,
apart from a couple of cases with a pretty well known context. So,
there're two cases:
1) io_issue_sqe() from the task context and protected by ->uring_lock.
Either requests return back to io_uring or handed to task_work, which
won't be executed because we're currently controlling that task. So,
we can be sure that requests are staying alive all the time and we don't
need submission references to pin them.

2) io_issue_sqe() from io-wq, which doesn't hold the mutex. The role of
submission reference is played by io-wq reference, which is put by
io_wq_submit_work(). Hence, it should be fine.

Considering that, we can carefully kill the submission reference.
