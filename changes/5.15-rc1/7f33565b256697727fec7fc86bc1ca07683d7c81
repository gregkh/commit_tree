s390/uv: de-duplicate checks for Protected Host Virtualization

De-duplicate checks for Protected Host Virtualization in decompressor and
kernel.

Set prot_virt_host=0 in the decompressor in *any* of the following cases
and hand it over to the decompressed kernel:
* No explicit prot_virt=1 is given on the kernel command-line
* Protected Guest Virtualization is enabled
* Hardware support not present
* kdump or stand-alone dump

The decompressed kernel needs to use only is_prot_virt_host() instead of
performing again all checks done by the decompressor.
