rcutorture: Preempt rather than block when testing task stalls

Currently, rcu_torture_stall() does a one-jiffy timed wait when
stall_cpu_block is set.  This works, but emits a pointless splat in
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y kernels.  This commit avoids this splat by instead
invoking preempt_schedule() in CONFIG_PREEMPT=y kernels.

This uses an admittedly ugly #ifdef, but abstracted approaches just
looked worse.  A prettier approach would provide a preempt_schedule()
definition with a WARN_ON() for CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernels, but this seems
quite silly.
