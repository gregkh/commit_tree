tracing/probe: Change traceprobe_set_print_fmt() to take a type

Instead of a boolean "is_return" have traceprobe_set_print_fmt() take a
type (currently just PROBE_PRINT_NORMAL and PROBE_PRINT_RETURN). This will
simplify adding different types. For example, the development of the
event_probe, will need its own type as it prints an event, and not an IP.
