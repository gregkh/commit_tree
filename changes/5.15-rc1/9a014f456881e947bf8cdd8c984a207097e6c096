powerpc/pseries/pci: Add a msi_free() handler to clear XIVE data

The MSI domain clears the IRQ with msi_domain_free(), which calls
irq_domain_free_irqs_top(), which clears the handler data. This is a
problem for the XIVE controller since we need to unmap MMIO pages and
free a specific XIVE structure.

The 'msi_free()' handler is called before irq_domain_free_irqs_top()
when the handler data is still available. Use that to clear the XIVE
controller data.
