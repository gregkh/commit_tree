KVM: selftests: Support multiple slots in dirty_log_perf_test

Introduce a new option to dirty_log_perf_test: -x number_of_slots. This
causes the test to attempt to split the region of memory into the given
number of slots. If the region cannot be evenly divided, the test will
fail.

This allows testing with more than one slot and therefore measure how
performance scales with the number of memslots.
