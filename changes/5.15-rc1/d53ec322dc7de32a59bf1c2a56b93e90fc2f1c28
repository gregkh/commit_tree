drm/i915/ttm: switch over to ttm_buddy_man

Move back to the buddy allocator for managing device local memory, and
restore the lost mock selftests. Keep around the range manager related
bits, since we likely need this for managing stolen at some point. For
stolen we also don't need to reserve anything so no need to support a
generic reserve interface.

v2(Thomas):
    - bo->page_alignment is in page units, not bytes
