staging: r8188eu: Replace BITn with BIT(n)

The driver uses BITn instead of BIT(n). All such usage is converted.

Note that this patch does not address any warnings that checkpatch
will find. These include missing space around operators and lines
that are too long. These problems will be addressed in a separate
patch.
