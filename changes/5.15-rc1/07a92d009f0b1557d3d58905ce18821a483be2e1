svcrdma: Convert rdma->sc_rw_ctxts to llist

Relieve contention on sc_rw_ctxt_lock by converting rdma->sc_rw_ctxts
to an llist.

The goal is to reduce the average overhead of Send completions,
because a transport's completion handlers are single-threaded on
one CPU core. This change reduces CPU utilization of each Send
completion by 2-3% on my server.
