microblaze: simplify pte_alloc_one_kernel()

The microblaze's implementation of pte_alloc_one_kernel() used
memblock_alloc_try_nid_raw() along with clear_page() to allocated a zeroed
page during early setup.

Replace calls of these functions with a call to memblock_alloc_try_nid()
that already returns zeroed page and respects the same allocation limits
as memblock_alloc_try_nid_raw().

While on it drop early_get_page() wrapper that was only used in
pte_alloc_one_kernel().
