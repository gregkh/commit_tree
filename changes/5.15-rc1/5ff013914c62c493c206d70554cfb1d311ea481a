brcmfmac: firmware: Allow per-board firmware binaries

After some crashes in the 3D engine (!) on the Samsung GT-I8530
it turns out that the main firmware file can be device dependent,
something that was previously only handled for the NVRAM
parameter file.

Rewrite the code a bit so we can a per-board suffixed firmware
binary as well, if this does not exist we fall back to the
canonical firmware name.

Example: a 4330 device with the OF board compatible is
"samsung,gavini". We will first try
"brcmfmac4330-sdio.samsung,gavini.bin" then "brcmfmac4330-sdio.bin"
if that does not work.
