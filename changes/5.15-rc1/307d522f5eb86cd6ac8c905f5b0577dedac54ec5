signal/seccomp: Refactor seccomp signal and coredump generation

Factor out force_sig_seccomp from the seccomp signal generation and
place it in kernel/signal.c.  The function force_sig_seccomp takes a
parameter force_coredump to indicate that the sigaction field should
be reset to SIGDFL so that a coredump will be generated when the
signal is delivered.

force_sig_seccomp is then used to replace both seccomp_send_sigsys
and seccomp_init_siginfo.

force_sig_info_to_task gains an extra parameter to force using
the default signal action.

With this change seccomp is no longer a special case and there
becomes exactly one place do_coredump is called from.

Further it no longer becomes necessary for __seccomp_filter
to call do_group_exit.
