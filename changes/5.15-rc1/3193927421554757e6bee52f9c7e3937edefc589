drm/i915: Add support for explicit L3BANK steering

Because Render Power Gating restricts us to just a single subslice as a
valid steering target for reads of multicast registers in a SUBSLICE
range, the default steering we setup at init may not lead to a suitable
target for L3BANK multicast register.  In cases where it does not, use
explicit runtime steering whenever an L3BANK multicast register is read.

While we're at it, let's simplify the function a little bit and drop its
support for gen10/CNL since no such platforms ever materialized for real
use.  Multicast register steering is already an area that causes enough
confusion; no need to complicate it with what's effectively dead code.

v2:
 - Use gt->uncore instead of gt->i915->uncore.  (Tvrtko)
 - Use {} as table terminator.  (Rodrigo)

v3:
 - L3bank fuse register is a disable mask rather than an enable mask.
   We need to invert it before use.  (CI)

v4:
 - L3bank ID goes in the subslice field, not the slice field.  (CI)
