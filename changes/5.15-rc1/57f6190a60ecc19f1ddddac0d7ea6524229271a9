drm/panel: ws2401: Add driver for WideChips WS2401

This adds a driver for panels based on the WideChips WS2401 display
controller. This display controller is used in the Samsung LMS380KF01
display found in the Samsung GT-I8160 (Codina) mobile phone and
possibly others.

As is common with Samsung displays manufacturer commands are necessary
to configure the display to a working state.

The display optionally supports internal backlight control, but can
also use an external backlight.

This driver re-uses the DBI infrastructure to communicate with the
display.
