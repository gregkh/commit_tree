xfs: replace kmem_alloc_large() with kvmalloc()

There is no reason for this wrapper existing anymore. All the places
that use KM_NOFS allocation are within transaction contexts and
hence covered by memalloc_nofs_save/restore contexts. Hence we don't
need any special handling of vmalloc for large IOs anymore and
so special casing this code isn't necessary.
