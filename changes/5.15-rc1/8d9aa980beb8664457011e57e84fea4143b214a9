habanalabs: add support for f/w reset

When the f/w runs in secured mode, it can reset the ASIC when certain
events occur. In unsecured mode, the driver asks the f/w to reset the
ASIC for those events.

We need to perform the entire reset procedure but without accessing the
ASIC. i.e. without halting the engines and without sending messages
to the f/w.
