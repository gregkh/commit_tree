dmaengine: acpi: Check for errors from acpi_register_gsi() separately

While IRQ test agaist the returned variable in practice is a good enough
there is still a room for theoretical mistake in case the vIRQ of the
device contains the same error code that acpi_register_gsi() may return.
Due to this, check for error code separately from matching the vIRQs.

Besides that, append documentation to tell why acpi_gsi_to_irq() can't
be used and we call acpi_register_gsi() instead.
