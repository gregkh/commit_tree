kbuild: check CONFIG_AS_IS_LLVM instead of LLVM_IAS

LLVM_IAS is the user interface to set the -(no-)integrated-as flag,
and it should be used only for that purpose.

LLVM_IAS is checked in some places to determine the assembler type,
but it is not precise.

For example,

 $ make CC=gcc LLVM_IAS=1

... will use the GNU assembler (i.e. binutils) since LLVM_IAS=1 is
effective only when $(CC) is clang.

Of course, 'CC=gcc LLVM_IAS=1' is an odd combination, but the build
system can be more robust against such insane input.

Commit ba64beb17493a ("kbuild: check the minimum assembler version in
Kconfig") introduced CONFIG_AS_IS_GNU/LLVM, which is more precise
because Kconfig checks the version string from the assembler in use.
