drm/i915: finish INTEL_GEN and friends conversion

Commit 161058fb899e ("drm/i915: Add remaining conversions to GRAPHICS_VER")
did the last conversions to the new macros for version checks, but left
one instance behind and some other changes sneaked in to use INTEL_GEN.
Remove the last users so we can remove the macros.
