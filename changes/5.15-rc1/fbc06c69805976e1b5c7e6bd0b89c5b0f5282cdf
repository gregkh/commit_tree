x86/resctrl: Remove rdt_cdp_peer_get()

When CDP is enabled, rdt_cdp_peer_get() finds the alternative
CODE/DATA resource and returns the alternative domain. This is used
to determine if bitmaps overlap when there are aliased entries
in the two struct rdt_hw_resources.

Now that the ctrl_val[] used by the CODE/DATA resources is the same,
the search for an alternate resource/domain is not needed.

Replace rdt_cdp_peer_get() with resctrl_peer_type(), which returns
the alternative type. This can be passed to resctrl_arch_get_config()
with the same resource and domain.
