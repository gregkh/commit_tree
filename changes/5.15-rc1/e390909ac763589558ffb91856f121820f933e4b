thunderbolt: Add vendor specific NHI quirk for auto-clearing interrupt status

Introduce nhi_check_quirks() routine to handle any vendor specific quirks
to manage a hardware specific implementation.

On Intel hardware the USB4 controller supports clearing the interrupt
status register automatically right after it is being issued. For this
reason add a new quirk that does that on all Intel hardware.
