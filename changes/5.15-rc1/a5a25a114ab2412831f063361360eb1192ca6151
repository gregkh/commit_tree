ksmbd: Relax credit_charge check in smb2_validate_credit_charge()

smb2_validate_credit_charge() checks the CreditCharge field in the
request is valid with regards to the payload size.

The current implementation rejects requests with CreditCharge = 0 and a
payload < 64K, even though they should be accepted.

Set CreditCharge to a minimum value of 1 to avoid rejecting such
requests. This matches what samba4 does.

Fixes share enumeration for jcifs-ng clients.
