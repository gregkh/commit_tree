net: cs89x0: disable compile testing on powerpc

The ISA DMA API is inconsistent between architectures, and while
powerpc implements most of what the others have, it does not provide
isa_virt_to_bus():

../drivers/net/ethernet/cirrus/cs89x0.c: In function ‘net_open’:
../drivers/net/ethernet/cirrus/cs89x0.c:897:20: error: implicit declaration of function ‘isa_virt_to_bus’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
     (unsigned long)isa_virt_to_bus(lp->dma_buff));
../drivers/net/ethernet/cirrus/cs89x0.c:894:3: note: in expansion of macro ‘cs89_dbg’
   cs89_dbg(1, debug, "%s: dma %lx %lx\n",

I tried a couple of approaches to handle this consistently across
all architectures, but as this driver is really only used on
ARM, I ended up taking the easy way out and just disable compile
testing on powerpc.
