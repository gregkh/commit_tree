perf evsel: Separate missing feature detection from evsel__open_cpu()

This is a preparatory patch for the workqueue patches with the goal to
separate in evlist__open_cpu() the actual opening, which could be
performed in parallel, from the existing fallback mechanisms, which
should be handled sequentially.

This patch separates the missing feature detection in evsel__open_cpu()
into a new evsel__detect_missing_features() function.
