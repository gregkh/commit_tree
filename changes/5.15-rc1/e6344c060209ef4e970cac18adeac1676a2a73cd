iwlwifi: fw: correctly limit to monitor dump

In commit 79f033f6f229 ("iwlwifi: dbg: don't limit dump decisions
to all or monitor") we changed the code to pass around a bitmap,
but in the monitor_only case, one place accidentally used the bit
number, not the bit mask, resulting in CSR and FW_INFO getting
dumped instead of monitor data. Fix that.
