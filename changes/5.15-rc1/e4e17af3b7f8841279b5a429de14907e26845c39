locking/rtmutex: Reduce <linux/rtmutex.h> header dependencies, only include <linux/rbtree_types.h>

We have the following header dependency problem on RT:

 - <linux/rtmutex.h> needs the definition of 'struct rb_root_cached'.
 - <linux/rbtree.h> includes <linux/kernel.h>, which includes <linux/spinlock.h>

That works nicely for non-RT enabled kernels, but on RT enabled kernels
spinlocks are based on rtmutexes, which creates another circular header
dependency as <linux/spinlocks.h> will require <linux/rtmutex.h>.

Include <linux/rbtree_types.h> instead.
