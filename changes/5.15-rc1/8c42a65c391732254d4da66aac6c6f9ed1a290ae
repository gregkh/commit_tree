scsi: lpfc: Add cm statistics buffer support

The cmf framework requires the driver to maintain a cm statistics table,
accessible inband, of congestion related statistics that are reported per
minute, rolled up to per hour, and rolled up again per day. Several days
worth may be maintained.  The table is registered with the adapter when the
MIB feature is enabled.

Add definition of the table and add support to register the table with the
adapter. Includes definition and initialization of event counters that are
later added to the statistics table.
