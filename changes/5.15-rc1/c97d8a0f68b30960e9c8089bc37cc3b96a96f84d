io_uring: avoid touching inode in rw prep

If we use fixed files, we can be sure (almost) that REQ_F_ISREG is set.
However, for non-reg files io_prep_rw() still will look into inode to
double check, and that's expensive and can be avoided.

The only caveat is that it only currently works with 64+ bit
architectures, see FFS_ISREG, so we should consider that.
