Bluetooth: btusb: Make the CSR clone chip force-suspend workaround more generic

Turns out Hans de Goede completed the work I started last year trying to
improve Chinese-clone detection of CSR controller chips. Quirk after quirk
these Bluetooth dongles are more usable now.

Even after a few BlueZ regressions; these clones are so fickle that some
days they stop working altogether. Except on Windows, they work fine.

But this force-suspend initialization quirk seems to mostly do the trick,
after a lot of testing Bluetooth now seems to work *all* the time.

The only problem is that the solution ended up being masked under a very
stringent check; when there are probably hundreds of fake dongle
models out there that benefit from a good reset. Make it so.
