RDMA/qedr: Move variables reset to qedr_set_common_qp_params()

Qedr code is tightly coupled with existing both INIT transitions.  Here,
during first INIT transition all variables are reset and the RESET state
is checked in post_recv() before any posting.

Commit dc70f7c3ed34 ("RDMA/cma: Remove unnecessary INIT->INIT transition")
exposed this bug.

So moving variables reset to qedr_set_common_qp_params() and also avoid
RESET state check for post_recv().
