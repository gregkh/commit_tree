devlink: Clear whole devlink_flash_notify struct

The { 0 } doesn't clear all fields in the struct, but tells to the
compiler to set all fields to zero and doesn't touch any sub-fields
if they exists.

The {} is an empty initialiser that instructs to fully initialize whole
struct including sub-fields, which is error-prone for future
devlink_flash_notify extensions.
