net: dsa: sja1105: increase MTU to account for VLAN header on DSA ports

Since all packets are transmitted as VLAN-tagged over a DSA link (this
VLAN tag represents the tag_8021q header), we need to increase the MTU
of these interfaces to account for the possibility that we are already
transporting a user-visible VLAN header.
