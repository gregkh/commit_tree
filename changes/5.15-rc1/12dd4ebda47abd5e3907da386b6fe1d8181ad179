arm64: dts: qcom: Fix usb entries for SA8155p adp board

SA8155p adp board has two USB A-type receptacles called
USB-portB and USB-portC respectively.

While USB-portB is a USB High-Speed connector/interface, the
USB-portC one is a USB 3.1 Super-Speed connector/interface.

Also the USB-portB is used as the USB emergency
download port (for image download purposes).

Enable both the ports on the board in USB Host mode (since all
the USB interfaces are brought out to USB Type A
connectors).
