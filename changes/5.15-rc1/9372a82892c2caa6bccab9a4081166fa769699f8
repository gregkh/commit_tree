s390/debug: fix debug area life cycle

Currently allocation and registration of s390dbf debug areas are tied
together. As a result, a debug area cannot be unregistered and
re-registered while any process has an associated debugfs file open.

Fix this by splitting alloc/release from register/unregister.
