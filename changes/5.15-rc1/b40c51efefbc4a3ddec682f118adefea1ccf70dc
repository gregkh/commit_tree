devlink: Add API to register and unregister single parameter

Currently device configuration parameters can be registered as an array.
Due to this a constant array must be registered. A single driver
supporting multiple devices each with different device capabilities end
up registering all parameters even if it doesn't support it.

One possible workaround a driver can do is, it registers multiple single
entry arrays to overcome such limitation.

Better is to provide a API that enables driver to register/unregister a
single parameter. This also further helps in two ways.
(1) to reduce the memory of devlink_param_entry by avoiding in registering
parameters which are not supported by the device.
(2) avoid generating multiple parameter add, delete, publish, unpublish,
init value notifications for such unsupported parameters
