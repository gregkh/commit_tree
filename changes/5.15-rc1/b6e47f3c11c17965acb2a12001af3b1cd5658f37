ARM: 9109/1: oabi-compat: add epoll_pwait handler

The epoll_wait() syscall has a special version for OABI compat
mode to convert the arguments to the EABI structure layout
of the kernel. However, the later epoll_pwait() syscall was
added in arch/arm in linux-2.6.32 without this conversion.

Use the same kind of handler for both.
