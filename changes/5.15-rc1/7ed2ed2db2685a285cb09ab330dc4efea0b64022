powerpc/pseries/iommu: Add ddw_property_create() and refactor enable_ddw()

Code used to create a ddw property that was previously scattered in
enable_ddw() is now gathered in ddw_property_create(), which deals with
allocation and filling the property, letting it ready for
of_property_add(), which now occurs in sequence.

This created an opportunity to reorganize the second part of enable_ddw():

Without this patch enable_ddw() does, in order:
kzalloc() property & members, create_ddw(), fill ddwprop inside property,
ddw_list_new_entry(), do tce_setrange_multi_pSeriesLP_walk in all memory,
of_add_property(), and list_add().

With this patch enable_ddw() does, in order:
create_ddw(), ddw_property_create(), of_add_property(),
ddw_list_new_entry(), do tce_setrange_multi_pSeriesLP_walk in all memory,
and list_add().

This change requires of_remove_property() in case anything fails after
of_add_property(), but we get to do tce_setrange_multi_pSeriesLP_walk
in all memory, which looks the most expensive operation, only if
everything else succeeds.

Also, the error path got remove_ddw() replaced by a new helper
__remove_dma_window(), which only removes the new DDW with an rtas-call.
For this, a new helper clean_dma_window() was needed to clean anything
that could left if walk_system_ram_range() fails.
