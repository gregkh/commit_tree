btrfs: reset this_bio_flag to avoid inheriting old flags

In btrfs_do_readpage(), we never reset @this_bio_flag after we hit a
compressed extent.

This is fine, as for PAGE_SIZE == sectorsize case, we can only have one
sector for one page, thus @this_bio_flag will only be set at most once.

But for subpage case, after hitting a compressed extent, @this_bio_flag
will always have EXTENT_BIO_COMPRESSED bit, even we're reading a regular
extent.

This will lead to various read errors, and causing new ASSERT() in
incoming subpage patches, which adds more strict check in
btrfs_submit_compressed_read().

Fix it by declaring @this_bio_flag inside the main loop and reset its
value for each iteration.
