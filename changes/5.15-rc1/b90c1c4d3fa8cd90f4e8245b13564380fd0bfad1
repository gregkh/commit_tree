crypto: qat - fix naming for init/shutdown VF to PF notifications

At start and shutdown, VFs notify the PF about their state. These
notifications are carried out through a message exchange using the PFVF
protocol.

Function names lead to believe they do perform init or shutdown logic.
This is to fix the naming to better reflect their purpose.
