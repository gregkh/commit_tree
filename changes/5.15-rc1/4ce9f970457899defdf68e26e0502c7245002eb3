checkpatch: improve GIT_COMMIT_ID test

The preferred git commit id reference has the form

	commit <SHA-1> ("Title line")

where SHA-1 is the commit hex hash with a minimum lenth of 12 and ("Title
line") is the complete title line of the commit with a (" prefix and ")
suffix.

The current tests fail when the "Title line" has one or more embedded
double quotes.

Improve the test that finds the commit SHA-1 hex hash then ("Title line")
by using $balanced_parens for a maximum of 3 consecutive lines.
