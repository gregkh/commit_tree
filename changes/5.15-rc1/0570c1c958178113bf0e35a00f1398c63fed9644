net/mlx5e: Take RQT out of TIR and group RX resources

RQT is not part of TIR, as multiple TIRs may point to the same RQT, as
it happens with indir_tir and inner_indir_tir. These instances of a TIR
don't use the embedded RQT.

This commit takes RQT out of TIR, making them independent. The RQTs are
placed into struct mlx5e_rx_res, and items in that struct are regrouped
by functionality: RSS, channels and PTP.
