pwm: lpc32xx: Don't modify HW state in .probe() after the PWM chip was registered

This fixes a race condition: After pwmchip_add() is called there might
already be a consumer and then modifying the hardware behind the
consumer's back is bad. So set the default before.

(Side-note: I don't know what this register setting actually does, if
this modifies the polarity there is an inconsistency because the
inversed polarity isn't considered if the PWM is already running during
.probe().)
