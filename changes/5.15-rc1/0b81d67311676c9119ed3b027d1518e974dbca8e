ravb: Add tx_counters to struct ravb_hw_info

The register for retrieving TX counters is present only on R-Car Gen3
and RZ/G2L; it is not present on R-Car Gen2.

Add the tx_counters hw feature bit to struct ravb_hw_info, to enable this
feature specifically for R-Car Gen3 now and later extend it to RZ/G2L.
