scsi: qla2xxx: Fix hang on NVMe command timeouts

The abort callback gets called only when it gets posted to firmware. The
refcounting is done properly in the callback. On internal errors, the
callback is not invoked leading to a hung I/O. Fix this by having separate
error code when command gets returned from firmware.
