KVM: nVMX: Remove obsolete MSR bitmap refresh at nested transitions

Drop unnecessary MSR bitmap updates during nested transitions, as L1's
APIC_BASE MSR is not modified by the standard VM-Enter/VM-Exit flows,
and L2's MSR bitmap is managed separately.  In the unlikely event that L1
is pathological and loads APIC_BASE via the VM-Exit load list, KVM will
handle updating the bitmap in its normal WRMSR flows.
