KVM: VMX: Smush x2APIC MSR bitmap adjustments into single function

Consolidate all of the dynamic MSR bitmap adjustments into
vmx_update_msr_bitmap_x2apic(), and rename the mode tracker to reflect
that it is x2APIC specific.  If KVM gains more cases of dynamic MSR
pass-through, odds are very good that those new cases will be better off
with their own logic, e.g. see Intel PT MSRs and MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL.

Attempting to handle all updates in a common helper did more harm than
good, as KVM ended up collecting a large number of useless "updates".
