workqueue: Rename "delayed" (delayed by active management) to "inactive"

There are two kinds of "delayed" work items in workqueue subsystem.

One is for timer-delayed work items which are visible to workqueue users.
The other kind is for work items delayed by active management which can
not be directly visible to workqueue users.  We mixed the word "delayed"
for both kinds and caused somewhat ambiguity.

This patch renames the later one (delayed by active management) to
"inactive", because it is used for workqueue active management and
most of its related symbols are named with "active" or "activate".

All "delayed" and "DELAYED" are carefully checked and renamed one by
one to avoid accidentally changing the name of the other kind for
timer-delayed.

No functional change intended.
