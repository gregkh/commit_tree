f2fs: fix to stop filesystem update once CP failed

During f2fs_write_checkpoint(), once we failed in
f2fs_flush_nat_entries() or do_checkpoint(), metadata of filesystem
such as prefree bitmap, nat/sit version bitmap won't be recovered,
it may cause f2fs image to be inconsistent, let's just set CP error
flag to avoid further updates until we figure out a scheme to rollback
all metadatas in such condition.
