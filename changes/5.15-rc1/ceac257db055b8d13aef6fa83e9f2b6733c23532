firmware: arm_scmi: Add optional transport_init/exit support

Some SCMI transport could need to perform some transport specific setup
before they can be used by the SCMI core transport layer: typically this
early setup consists in registering with some other kernel subsystem.

Add the optional capability for a transport to provide a couple of init
and exit functions that are assured to be called early during the SCMI
core initialization phase, well before the SCMI core probing step.
