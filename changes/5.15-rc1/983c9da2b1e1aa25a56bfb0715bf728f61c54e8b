net/mlx5e: Remove mlx5e_priv usage from mlx5e_build_*tir_ctx*()

The functions that build TIR context for TIR create and modify commands
used to depend on struct mlx5e_priv and fetch some values directly from
different places. It increased coupling of code and the chance of weird
misbehavior due to hidden complex dependencies.

As the first step, this commit removes the priv parameter from these
functions. Instead, the necessary values are passed directly.
