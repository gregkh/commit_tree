selftests: vm: add KSM zero page merging test

Add check_ksm_zero_page_merge() function to test that empty pages are
being handled properly.  For this, several zero pages are allocated and
merged using madvise.  If use_zero_pages is enabled, the pages must be
shared with the special kernel zero pages; otherwise, they are merged as
usual duplicate pages.  The test is run as follows: ./ksm_tests -Z
