ARM: dts: imx53-ppd: Fix ACHC entry

PPD has only one ACHC device, which effectively is a Kinetis
microcontroller. It has one SPI interface used for normal
communication. Additionally it's possible to flash the device
firmware using NXP's EzPort protocol by correctly driving a
second chip select pin and the device reset pin.
