octeontx2-pf: cn10K: Reserve LMTST lines per core

This patch reserves the LMTST lines per cpu instead
of separate LMTST lines for NPA(buffer free) and NIX(sqe flush).
LMTST line of the core on which SQ or RQ is processed is used
for LMTST operation.

This patch also replace STEOR with STEORL release semantics and
updates driver name in ethtool file.
