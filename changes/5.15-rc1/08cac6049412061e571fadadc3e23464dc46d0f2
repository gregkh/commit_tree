kcsan: Reduce get_ctx() uses in kcsan_found_watchpoint()

There are a number get_ctx() calls that are close to each other, which
results in poor codegen (repeated preempt_count loads).

Specifically in kcsan_found_watchpoint() (even though it's a slow-path)
it is beneficial to keep the race-window small until the watchpoint has
actually been consumed to avoid missed opportunities to report a race.

Let's clean it up a bit before we add more code in
kcsan_found_watchpoint().
