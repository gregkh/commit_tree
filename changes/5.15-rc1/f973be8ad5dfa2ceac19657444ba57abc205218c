gpio: dwapb: Read GPIO base from gpio-base property

For backward compatibility with some legacy devices introduce
a new (*) property gpio-base to read GPIO base. This will allow
further cleaning up of the driver.

*) Note, it's not new for the GPIO library since the mockup driver
   is using it already.
