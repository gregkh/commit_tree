tracing/boot: Show correct histogram error command

Since trigger_process_regex() modifies given trigger actions
while parsing, the error message couldn't show what command
was passed to the trigger_process_regex() when it returns
an error.

To fix that, show the backed up trigger action command
instead of parsed buffer.
