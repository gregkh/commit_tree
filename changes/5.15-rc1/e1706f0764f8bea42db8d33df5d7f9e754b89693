vfio/samples: Remove module get/put

The patch to move the get/put to core and the patch to convert the samples
to use vfio_device crossed in a way that this was missed. When both
patches are together the samples do not need their own get/put.

Fixes: 437e41368c01 ("vfio/mdpy: Convert to use vfio_register_group_dev()")
Fixes: 681c1615f891 ("vfio/mbochs: Convert to use vfio_register_group_dev()")
