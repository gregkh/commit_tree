drm/ingenic: Use standard drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail

By making the CRTC's .vblank_enable() function return an error when it
is known that the hardware won't deliver a VBLANK, we can drop the
ingenic_drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail() function and use the standard
drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail() function instead.
