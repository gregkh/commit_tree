octeontx2-af: cn10k: Fix SDP base channel number

As per hardware the base channel number configured
for programmable channels of a block must be multiple
of number of channels of that block. This condition
is not met for SDP base channel currently. Hence this
patch ensures all the base channel numbers of all
blocks are multiple of number of channels present in
the blocks. Also instead of hardcoding SDP number
of channels the same is read from the NIX_AF_CONST1
register.
