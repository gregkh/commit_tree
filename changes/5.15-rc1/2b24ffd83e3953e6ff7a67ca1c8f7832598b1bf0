dpaa2-switch: no need to check link state right after ndo_open

The call to dpaa2_switch_port_link_state_update is a leftover from the
time when on DPAA2 platforms the PHYs were started at boot time so when
an ifconfig was issued on the associated interface, the link status
needed to be checked directly from the ndo_open() callback.  This is not
needed anymore since we are now properly integrated with the PHY layer
thus a link interrupt will come directly from the PHY eventually without
the need to call the sync function.
Fix this up by removing the call to dpaa2_switch_port_link_state_update.
