scsi: scsi_debug: Remove dump_sector()

The function used to dump sectors containing protection information errors
was useful during initial development over a decade ago.  However,
dump_sector() substantially slows down the system during testing due to
writing an entire sector's worth of data to syslog on every error.

We now log plenty of information about the nature of detected protection
information errors throughout the stack. Dumping the entire contents of an
offending sector is no longer needed.
