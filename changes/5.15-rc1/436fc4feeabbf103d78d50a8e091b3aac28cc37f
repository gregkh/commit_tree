s390: add kmemleak annotation in stack_alloc()

kmemleak with enabled auto scanning reports that our stack allocation is
lost. This is because we're saving the pointer + STACK_INIT_OFFSET to
lowcore. When kmemleak now scans the objects, it thinks that this one is
lost because it can't find a corresponding pointer.
