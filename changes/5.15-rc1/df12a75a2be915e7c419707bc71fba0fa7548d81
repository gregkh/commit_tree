mtd: spinand: core: Properly fill the OOB area.

The comment in spinand_write_to_cache_op() says that
spinand_ondie_ecc_prepare_io_req() should 0xff fill the OOB
area but it doesn't.

This causes the OOB area to get filled with zeros
and anytime the first page in a block the bad block marker
is cleared and it becomes a bad block on the next boot.

This was observed on Longsys FORSEE branded parts and
might be specific to these parts.
