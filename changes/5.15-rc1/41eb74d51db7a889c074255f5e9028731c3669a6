drm/i915/cnl: Drop all workarounds

All of the Cannon Lake hardware that came out had graphics fused off,
and our userspace drivers have already dropped their support for the
platform; CNL-specific code in i915 that isn't inherited by subsequent
platforms is effectively dead code.  Let's remove all of the
CNL-specific workarounds as a quick and easy first step.
