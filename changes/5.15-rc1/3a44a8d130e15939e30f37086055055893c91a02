arm64: dts: renesas: salvator-xs: Factor out USB ch3 parts

Move the parts related to the fourth USB2 interface on Salvator-XS
boards to salvator-xs.dtsi, to avoid future duplication of board
descriptions.

As this interface is not present on all SoCs that can be found on
Salvator-X(S), but only on R-Car H3 ES2.0+, its descriptions are
protected by the preprocessor symbol SOC_HAS_USB2_CH3, defined in
r8a77951.dtsi, and undefined in r8a77950.dtsi.
