staging: r8188eu: change declaration of Efuse_Read1ByteFromFakeContent

Remove forward declaration of Efuse_Read1ByteFromFakeContent function
from core/rtw_efuse.c, as the function is defined in full directly
after this and therefore this forward declaration is redundant.

In addition, convert the storage class of the function to static, as the
function is only used with rtw_efuse.c, and tidy up the signature
alignment.
