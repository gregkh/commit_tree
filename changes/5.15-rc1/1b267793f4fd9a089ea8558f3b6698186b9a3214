time/timekeeping: Avoid invoking clock_was_set() twice

do_adjtimex() might end up scheduling a delayed clock_was_set() via
timekeeping_advance() and then invoke clock_was_set() directly which is
pointless.

Make timekeeping_advance() return whether an invocation of clock_was_set()
is required and handle it at the call sites which allows do_adjtimex() to
issue a single direct call if required.
