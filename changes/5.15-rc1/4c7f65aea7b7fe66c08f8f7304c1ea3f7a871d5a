xfs: rename buffer cache index variable b_bn

To stop external users from using b_bn as the disk address of the
buffer, rename it to b_rhash_key to indicate that it is the buffer
cache index, not the block number of the buffer. Code that needs the
disk address should use xfs_buf_daddr() to obtain it.

Do the rename and clean up any of the remaining internal b_bn users.
Also clean up any remaining b_bn cruft that is now unused.
