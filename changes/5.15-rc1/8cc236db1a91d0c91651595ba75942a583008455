wwan: core: Fix missing RTM_NEWLINK event for default link

A wwan link created via the wwan_create_default_link procedure is
never notified to the user (RTM_NEWLINK), causing issues with user
tools relying on such event to track network links (NetworkManager).

This is because the procedure misses a call to rtnl_configure_link(),
which sets the link as initialized and notifies the new link (cf
proper usage in __rtnl_newlink()).
