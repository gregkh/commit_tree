KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Fix TM softpatch HFAC interrupt emulation

Have the TM softpatch emulation code set up the HFAC interrupt and
return -1 in case an instruction was executed with HFSCR bits clear,
and have the interrupt exit handler fall through to the HFAC handler.
When the L0 is running a nested guest, this ensures the HFAC interrupt
is correctly passed up to the L1.

The "direct guest" exit handler will turn these into PROGILL program
interrupts so functionality in practice will be unchanged. But it's
possible an L1 would want to handle these in a different way.

Also rearrange the FAC interrupt emulation code to match the HFAC format
while here (mainly, adding the FSCR_INTR_CAUSE mask).
