drm/i915/ttm: add ttm_buddy_man

Add back our standalone i915_buddy allocator and integrate it into a
ttm_resource_manager. This will plug into our ttm backend for managing
device local-memory in the next couple of patches.

v2(Thomas):
    - Return -ENOSPC from the buddy; ttm expects this in order to
      trigger eviction
    - Drop the unnecessary inline
    - bo->page_alignment is in page units
