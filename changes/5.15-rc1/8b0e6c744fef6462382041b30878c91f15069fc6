tracing: Add DYNAMIC flag for dynamic events

To differentiate between static and dynamic events, add a new flag
DYNAMIC to the event flags that all dynamic events have set. This will
allow to differentiate when attaching to a dynamic event from a static
event.

Static events have a mod pointer that references the module they were
created in (or NULL for core kernel). This can be incremented when the
event has something attached to it. But there exists no such mechanism for
dynamic events. This is dangerous as the dynamic events may now disappear
without the "attachment" knowing that it no longer exists.

To enforce the dynamic flag, change dyn_event_add() to pass the event that
is being created such that it can set the DYNAMIC flag of the event. This
helps make sure that no location that creates a dynamic event misses
setting this flag.
