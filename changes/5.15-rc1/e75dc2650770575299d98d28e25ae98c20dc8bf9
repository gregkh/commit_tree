nfp: flower: refactor action offload code slightly

Change the action related offload functions to take in flow_rule *
as input instead of flow_cls_offload * as input. The flow_rule
parts of flow_cls_offload is the only part that is used in any
case, and this is required for more conntrack offload patches
which will follow later.
