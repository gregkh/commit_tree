drm: mxsfb: Increase number of outstanding requests on V4 and newer HW

In case the DRAM is under high load, the MXSFB FIFO might underflow
and that causes visible artifacts. This could be triggered on i.MX8MM
using e.g. "$ memtester 128M" on a device with 1920x1080 panel. The
first "Stuck Address" test of the memtester will completely corrupt
the image on the panel and leave the MXSFB FIFO in odd state.

To avoid this underflow, increase number of outstanding requests to
DRAM from 2 to 16, which is the maximum. This mitigates the issue
and it can no longer be triggered.
