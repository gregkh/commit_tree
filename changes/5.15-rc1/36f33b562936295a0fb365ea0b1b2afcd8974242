lib/test: convert test_sort.c to use KUnit

This follows up commit ebd09577be6c ("lib/test: convert
lib/test_list_sort.c to use KUnit").

Converting this test to KUnit makes the test a bit shorter, standardizes
how it reports pass/fail, and adds an easier way to run the test [1].

Like ebd09577be6c, this leaves the file and Kconfig option name the same,
but slightly changes their dependencies (needs CONFIG_KUNIT).

[1] Can be run via
$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --kunitconfig /dev/stdin <<EOF
CONFIG_KUNIT=y
CONFIG_TEST_SORT=y
EOF

[11:30:30] [PASSED] test_sort
[11:30:30] ============================================================
[11:30:30] Testing complete. 1 tests run. 0 failed. 0 crashed. 0 skipped.
[11:30:30] Elapsed time: 37.032s total, 0.001s configuring, 34.090s building, 0.000s running

Note: this is the time it took after a `make mrproper`.

With an incremental rebuild, this looks more like:
[11:38:58] Elapsed time: 6.444s total, 0.001s configuring, 3.416s building, 0.000s running

Since the test has no dependencies, it can also be run (with some other
tests) with just:
$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run
