fpga: dfl: pci: add device IDs for Silicom N501x PAC cards

This adds the approved PCI Express Device IDs for the Silicom PAC N5010
and N5011 cards (aka. Silicom Lightning Creek cards).

The N5010 features an FPGA that manages/interfaces four QSFP ports, and
allows on-board custom packet processing/filtering/routing, based on
logic loaded with user-provided FPGA bitstreams.

The N5011 cards adds a PCIe switch that exposes, in addition to the FPGA
itself, two Intel E810 (aka Columbiaville) ethernet controllers. With
this, packets can be forwarded from the FPGA to the host for further
processing.
