habanalabs: mark linux image as not loaded after hw_fini

If hard reset fails after the call to hw_fini and before loading the
linux image to the device, a subsequent call to hw_fini should
communicate via COMMS (or MSG_TO_CPU regs for old FW versions).
However, the driver still tries in this case to communicate via the GIC,
and thus no hard reset is actually done.
To avoid that, the patch clears the linux_loaded flag after every call
to hw_fini.
