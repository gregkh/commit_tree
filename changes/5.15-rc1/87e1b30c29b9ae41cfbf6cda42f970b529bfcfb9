ARM: at91: pm: avoid push and pop on stack while memory is in self-refersh

For the previous AT91 RAM controller and self-refresh procedure this
had no side effects. However, for SAMA7G5 the self-refresh procedure
doesn't allow this anymore as the RAM controller ports are closed
before switching it to self-refresh. This commits prepares the code
for the following ones adding self-refresh and PM support for SAMA7G5.
