media: uvc: don't do DMA on stack

As warned by smatch:
	drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_v4l2.c:911 uvc_ioctl_g_input() error: doing dma on the stack (&i)
	drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_v4l2.c:943 uvc_ioctl_s_input() error: doing dma on the stack (&i)

those two functions call uvc_query_ctrl passing a pointer to
a data at the DMA stack. those are used to send URBs via
usb_control_msg(). Using DMA stack is not supported and should
not work anymore on modern Linux versions.

So, use a kmalloc'ed buffer.
