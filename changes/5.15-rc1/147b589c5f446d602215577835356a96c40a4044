remoteproc: fix kernel doc for struct rproc_ops

The load_rsc_table was removed since the
commit c1d35c1ab424 ("remoteproc: Rename "load_rsc_table" to "parse_fw"")
but got added back again by mistake in the below commit:
commit b1a17513a2d6 ("remoteproc: add vendor resources handling").

The patch fixed a small code indent issue which not worth
a separate patch.
