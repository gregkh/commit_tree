KVM: arm64: Avoid mapping size adjustment on permission fault

Since we only support PMD-sized mappings for THP, getting
a permission fault on a level that results in a mapping
being larger than PAGE_SIZE is a sure indication that we have
already upgraded our mapping to a PMD.

In this case, there is no need to try and parse userspace page
tables, as the fault information already tells us everything.
