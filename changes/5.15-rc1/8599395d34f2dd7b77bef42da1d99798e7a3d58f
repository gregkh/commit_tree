powerpc/pseries/iommu: Find existing DDW with given property name

At the moment pseries stores information about created directly mapped
DDW window in DIRECT64_PROPNAME.

With the objective of implementing indirect DMA mapping with DDW, it's
necessary to have another propriety name to make sure kexec'ing into older
kernels does not break, as it would if we reuse DIRECT64_PROPNAME.

In order to have this, find_existing_ddw_windows() needs to be able to
look for different property names.

Extract find_existing_ddw_windows() into find_existing_ddw_windows_named()
and calls it with current property name.
