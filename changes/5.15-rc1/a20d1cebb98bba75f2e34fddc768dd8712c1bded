jbd2: fix portability problems caused by unaligned accesses

This commit applies the e2fsck/recovery.c portions of commit
1e0c8ca7c08a ("e2fsck: fix portability problems caused by unaligned
accesses) from the e2fsprogs git tree.

The on-disk format for the ext4 journal can have unaigned 32-bit
integers.  This can happen when replaying a journal using a obsolete
checksum format (which was never popularly used, since the v3 format
replaced v2 while the metadata checksum feature was being stablized).
