parisc: Fix unaligned-access crash in bootloader

Kernel v5.14 has various changes to optimize unaligned memory accesses,
e.g. commit 0652035a5794 ("asm-generic: unaligned: remove byteshift helpers").

Those changes triggered an unalignment-exception and thus crashed the
bootloader on parisc because the unaligned "output_len" variable now suddenly
was read word-wise while it was read byte-wise in the past.

Fix this issue by declaring the external output_len variable as char which then
forces the compiler to generate byte-accesses.
