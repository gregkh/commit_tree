usb: xhci-mtk: allow bandwidth table rollover

xhci-mtk has 64 slots for periodic bandwidth calculations and each
slot represents byte budgets on a microframe. When an endpoint's
allocation sits on the boundary of the table, byte budgets' slot
can be rolled over but the current implementation doesn't.

This patch allows the microframe index rollover and prevent
out-of-bounds array access.
