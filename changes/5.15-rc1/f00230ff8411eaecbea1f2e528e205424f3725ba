mm,do_huge_pmd_numa_page: remove unnecessary TLB flushing code

Before commit c5b5a3dd2c1f ("mm: thp: refactor NUMA fault handling"), the
TLB flushing is done in do_huge_pmd_numa_page() itself via
flush_tlb_range().

But after commit c5b5a3dd2c1f ("mm: thp: refactor NUMA fault handling"),
the TLB flushing is done in migrate_pages() as in the following code path
anyway.

do_huge_pmd_numa_page
  migrate_misplaced_page
    migrate_pages

So now, the TLB flushing code in do_huge_pmd_numa_page() becomes
unnecessary.  So the code is deleted in this patch to simplify the code.
This is only code cleanup, there's no visible performance difference.

The mmu_notifier_invalidate_range() in do_huge_pmd_numa_page() is
deleted too.  Because migrate_pages() takes care of that too when CPU
TLB is flushed.
