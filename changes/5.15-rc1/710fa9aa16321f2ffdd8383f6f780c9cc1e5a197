drm/panel: Fix up DT bindings for Samsung lms397kf04

Improve the bindings and make them more usable:

- Pick in spi-cpha and spi-cpol from the SPI node parent,
  this will specify that we are "type 3" in the device tree
  rather than hardcoding it in the operating system.
- Drop the u32 ref from the SPI frequency: comes in from
  the SPI host bindings.
- Make spi-cpha, spi-cpol and port compulsory.
- Update the example with a real-world SPI controller,
  spi-gpio.
