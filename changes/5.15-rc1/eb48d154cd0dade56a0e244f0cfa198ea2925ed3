arm64: Move .hyp.rodata outside of the _sdata.._edata range

The HYP rodata section is currently lumped together with the BSS,
which isn't exactly what is expected (it gets registered with
kmemleak, for example).

Move it away so that it is actually marked RO. As an added
benefit, it isn't registered with kmemleak anymore.
