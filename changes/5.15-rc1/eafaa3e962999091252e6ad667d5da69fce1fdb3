drm/i915: Handle cdclk crawling flag in standard manner

The 'has_cdclk_crawl' field in our device info structure is a boolean
flag and doesn't need a whole u8.  Add it as another 1-bit feature flag
and move it to the display section.  While we're at it, replace the
has_cdclk_crawl() function with a macro for consistency with our
handling of other feature flags.
