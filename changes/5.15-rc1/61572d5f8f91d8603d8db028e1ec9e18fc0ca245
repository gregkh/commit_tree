igc: Simplify TSN flags handling

Separates the procedure done during reset from applying a
configuration, knowing when the code is executing allow us to
separate the better what changes the hardware state from what
changes only the driver state.

Introduces a flag for bookkeeping the driver state of TSN
features. When Qav and frame-preemption is also implemented
this flag makes it easier to keep track on whether a TSN feature
driver state is enabled or not though controller state changes,
say, during a reset.
