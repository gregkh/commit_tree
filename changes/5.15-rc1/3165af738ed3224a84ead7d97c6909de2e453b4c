KVM: Allow to have arch-specific per-vm debugfs files

Allow archs to create arch-specific nodes under kvm->debugfs_dentry directory
besides the stats fields.  The new interface kvm_arch_create_vm_debugfs() is
defined but not yet used.  It's called after kvm->debugfs_dentry is created, so
it can be referenced directly in kvm_arch_create_vm_debugfs().  Arch should
define their own versions when they want to create extra debugfs nodes.
