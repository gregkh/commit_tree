usb: xhci-mtk: Do not use xhci's virt_dev in drop_endpoint

xhci-mtk depends on xhci's internal virt_dev when it retrieves its
internal data from usb_host_endpoint both in add_endpoint and
drop_endpoint callbacks. But when setup packet was retired by
transaction errors in xhci_setup_device() path, a virt_dev for the slot
is newly created with real_port 0. This leads to xhci-mtks's NULL pointer
dereference from drop_endpoint callback as xhci-mtk assumes that virt_dev's
real_port is always started from one. The similar problems were addressed
by [1] but that can't cover the failure cases from setup_device.

This patch drops the usages of xhci's virt_dev in xhci-mtk's drop_endpoint
callback by adopting hashtable for searching mtk's schedule entity
from a given usb_host_endpoint pointer instead of searching a linked list.
So mtk's drop_endpoint callback doesn't have to rely on virt_dev at all.
