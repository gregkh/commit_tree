scsi: lpfc: Add cmfsync WQE support

When congestion mgmt is enabled, cmf has the driver regularly issue a
command to synchronize reporting of congestion mgmt events such as fpin and
signal delivery.

This patch adds the definition of the CMF_SYNC WQE and its CQE fields as
well as support for issuing the command. The patch also adds the few
remaining cmf-related SLI additions, such as feature definition for
enablement of CMF and notifications to the driver if the cm enablement mode
changes.
