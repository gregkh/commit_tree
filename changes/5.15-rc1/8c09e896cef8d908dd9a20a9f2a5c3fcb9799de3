PCI: Allow PASID on fake PCIe devices without TLP prefixes

Some systems, e.g., HiSilicon KunPeng920 and KunPeng930, have devices that
appear as PCI but are actually on the AMBA bus.  Some of these fake PCI
devices support a PASID-like feature and they do have a working PASID
capability even though they do not use the PCIe Transport Layer Protocol
and do not support TLP prefixes.

Add a pasid_no_tlp bit for this "PASID works without TLP prefixes" case and
update pci_enable_pasid() so it can enable PASID on these devices.

Set this bit for HiSilicon KunPeng920 and KunPeng930.
