mm/page_alloc.c: avoid accessing uninitialized pcp page migratetype

If it's not prepared to free unref page, the pcp page migratetype is
unset.  Thus we will get rubbish from get_pcppage_migratetype() and
might list_del(&page->lru) again after it's already deleted from the list
leading to grumble about data corruption.
