cifs: enable fscache usage even for files opened as rw

So far, the fscache implementation we had supports only
a small set of use cases. Particularly for files opened
with O_RDONLY.

This commit enables it even for rw based file opens. It
also enables the reuse of cached data in case of mount
option (cache=singleclient) where it is guaranteed that
this is the only client (and server) which operates on
the files. There's also a single line change in fscache.c
to get around a bug seen in fscache.
