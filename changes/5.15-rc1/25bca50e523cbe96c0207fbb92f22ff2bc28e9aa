block: improve ioprio class description comment

In include/usapi/linux/ioprio.h, change the ioprio class enum comment
to remove the outdated reference to CFQ and mention BFQ and mq-deadline
instead. Also document the high priority NCQ command use for RT class
IOs directed at ATA drives that support NCQ priority.
