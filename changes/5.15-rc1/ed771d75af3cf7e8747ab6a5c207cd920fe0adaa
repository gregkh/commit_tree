media: i2c: adv7180: fix adv7280 BT.656-4 compatibility

Captured video would be out of sync when using the adv7280 with
the BT.656-4 protocol. Certain registers (0x04, 0x31, 0xE6) had to
be configured properly to ensure BT.656-4 compatibility.

An error in the adv7280 reference manual suggested that EAV/SAV mode
was enabled by default, however upon inspecting register 0x31, it was
determined to be disabled by default.
