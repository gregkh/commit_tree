ALSA: usb-audio: Move control message delay quirk into quirk_flags

We apply some delay for the control messages on certain devices as a
workaround, and this can be moved into the quirk_flags as well.
Currently there are three different delay periods (1ms, 5ms and 20ms),
so three different quirk bits are assigned for them.
