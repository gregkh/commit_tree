hwmon: (pmbus/bpa-rs600) Don't use rated limits as warn limits

In the initial implementation a number of PMBUS_x_WARN_LIMITs were
mapped to MFR fields. This was incorrect as these MFR limits reflect the
rated limit as opposed to a limit which will generate warning. Instead
return -ENXIO like we were already doing for other WARN_LIMITs.

Subsequently these rated limits have been exposed generically as new
fields in the sysfs ABI so the values are still available.
