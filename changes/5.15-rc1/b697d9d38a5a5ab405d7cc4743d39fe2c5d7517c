net: phy: marvell: add SFP support for 88E1510

Add support for SFP cages connected to the Marvell 88E1512 transceiver.
88E1512 supports for SGMII/1000Base-X/100Base-FX media type with RGMII
on system interface. Configure PHY to appropriate mode depending on the
type of SFP inserted. On SFP removal configure PHY to the RGMII-copper
mode so RJ-45 port can still work.
