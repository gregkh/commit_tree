PCI: xilinx-nwl: Enable the clock through CCF

Enable PCIe reference clock. There is no remove function that's why
this should be enough for simple operation.
Normally this clock is enabled by default by firmware but there are
usecases where this clock should be enabled by driver itself.
It is also good that PCIe clock is recorded in a clock framework.
