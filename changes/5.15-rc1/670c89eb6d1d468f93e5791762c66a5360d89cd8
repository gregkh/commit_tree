drm/i915: Clean up pre-skl wm calling convention

Just pass the full atomic state+crtc to the pre-skl watermark
functions, and clean up the types/variable names around the area.

Note that having both .compute_pipe_wm() and .compute_intermediate_wm()
is entirely redundant now. We could unify them to a single vfunc.
But let's do this one step at a time.
