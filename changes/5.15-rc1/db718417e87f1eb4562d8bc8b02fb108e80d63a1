arm64: dts: qcom: Add PMI8996 DTSI file

PMI8996 is *almost* the same hardware as PMI8994, say for some annoyances:

- Boards equipped with PMI8996 now have to include pmic-id (which wasn't the
case before)

- Different qpnp-ibb-discharge-resistor value (will be addressed after LABIBB
is introduced)

- Different inhibit-derating-ua value (will be addressed after BCL is
introduced)

- Different ramp_up_step value (will be addressed after [if?] QPNP Flash LED
is introduced)

This DTSI is supposed to be included >>ON TOP OF<< pmi8994.dtsi, like this:

-- msm8996-nice-device.dts --
\#include "pmi8994.dtsi"
\#include "pmi8996.dtsi"

or more likely like this:

-- msm8996-some-phone.dts --
\#include "msm8996.dtsi"
...
\#include "pmi8994.dtsi"

-- msm8996-pmi8996-some-phone.dts --
\#include "msm8996-some-phone.dts"
\#include "pmi8996.dtsi"

So that we only have to keep 2 DTs for devices that were shipped with both
ones, instead of what would be three (device base + pmi8994 + pmi8996)
