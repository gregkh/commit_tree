net: dpaa2-switch: phylink_disconnect_phy needs rtnl_lock

There is an ASSERT_RTNL in phylink_disconnect_phy which triggers
whenever dpaa2_switch_port_disconnect_mac is called.

To follow the pattern established by dpaa2_eth_disconnect_mac, take the
rtnl_mutex every time we call dpaa2_switch_port_disconnect_mac.
