PCI: Make saved capability state private to core

Interfaces and structs for saving and restoring PCI Capability state were
declared in include/linux/pci.h, but aren't needed outside drivers/pci/.

Move these to drivers/pci/pci.h:

  struct pci_cap_saved_data
  struct pci_cap_saved_state
  void pci_allocate_cap_save_buffers()
  void pci_free_cap_save_buffers()
  int pci_add_cap_save_buffer()
  int pci_add_ext_cap_save_buffer()
  struct pci_cap_saved_state *pci_find_saved_cap()
  struct pci_cap_saved_state *pci_find_saved_ext_cap()
