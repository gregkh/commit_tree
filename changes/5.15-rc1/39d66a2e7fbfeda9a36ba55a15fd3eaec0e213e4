dt-bindings: arm: qcom: Drop qcom,mtp

qcom,mtp is used msm8916-mtp.dts but not documented, it is a generic mtp
compatible and we have specfifc ones for each mtp so drop this

arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8916-mtp.dt.yaml: /: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
        ['qcom,msm8916-mtp', 'qcom,msm8916-mtp/1', 'qcom,msm8916', 'qcom,mtp'] is too long
        Additional items are not allowed ('qcom,msm8916', 'qcom,mtp' were unexpected)
        Additional items are not allowed ('qcom,mtp' was unexpected)
