samples: bpf: Convert xdp_redirect to XDP samples helper

Use the libbpf skeleton facility and other utilities provided by XDP
samples helper.

One important note:
The XDP samples helper handles ownership of installed XDP programs on
devices, including responding to SIGINT and SIGTERM, so drop the code
here and use the helpers we provide going forward for all xdp_redirect*
conversions.
