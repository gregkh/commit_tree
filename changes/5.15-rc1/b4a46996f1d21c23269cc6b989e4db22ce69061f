Bluetooth: hci_h5: Disable the hci_suspend_notifier for btrtl devices

The hci_suspend_notifier which was introduced last year, is causing
problems for uart attached btrtl devices. These devices may loose their
firmware and their baudrate setting over a suspend/resume.

Since we don't even know the baudrate after a suspend/resume recovering
from this is tricky. The driver solves this by treating these devices
the same as USB BT HCIs which drop of the bus during suspend.

Specifically the driver:
1. Simply unconditionally turns the device fully off during
   system-suspend to save maximum power.
2. Calls device_reprobe() from a workqueue to fully re-init the device
   from scratch on system-resume (unregistering the old HCI and
   registering a new HCI).

This means that these devices do not benefit from the suspend / resume
handling work done by the hci_suspend_notifier. At best this unnecessarily
adds some time to the suspend/resume time.

But in practice this is actually causing problems:

1. These btrtl devices seem to not like the HCI_OP_WRITE_SCAN_ENABLE(
SCAN_DISABLED) request being send to them when entering the
BT_SUSPEND_CONFIGURE_WAKE state. The same request send on
BT_SUSPEND_DISCONNECT works fine, but the second one send (unnecessarily?)
from the BT_SUSPEND_CONFIGURE_WAKE transition causes the device to hang:

[  573.497754] PM: suspend entry (s2idle)
[  573.554615] Filesystems sync: 0.056 seconds
[  575.837753] Bluetooth: hci0: Timed out waiting for suspend events
[  575.837801] Bluetooth: hci0: Suspend timeout bit: 4
[  575.837925] Bluetooth: hci0: Suspend notifier action (3) failed: -110

2. The PM_POST_SUSPEND / BT_RUNNING transition races with the
driver-unbinding done by the device_reprobe() work.
If the hci_suspend_notifier wins the race it is talking to a dead
device leading to the following errors being logged:

[  598.686060] Bluetooth: hci0: Timed out waiting for suspend events
[  598.686124] Bluetooth: hci0: Suspend timeout bit: 5
[  598.686237] Bluetooth: hci0: Suspend notifier action (4) failed: -110

In both cases things still work, but the suspend-notifier is causing
these ugly errors getting logged and ut increase both the suspend- and
the resume-time by 2 seconds.

This commit avoids these problems by disabling the hci_suspend_notifier.
