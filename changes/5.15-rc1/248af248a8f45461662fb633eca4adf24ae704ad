powerpc/xics: Rename the map handler in a check handler

This moves the IRQ initialization done under the different ICS backends
in the common part of XICS. The 'map' handler becomes a simple 'check'
on the HW IRQ at the FW level.

As we don't need an ICS anymore in xics_migrate_irqs_away(), the XICS
domain does not set a chip data for the IRQ.
