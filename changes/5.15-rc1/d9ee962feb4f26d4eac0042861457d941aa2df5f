rcu: Mark lockless ->qsmask read in rcu_check_boost_fail()

Accesses to ->qsmask are normally protected by ->lock, but there is an
exception in the diagnostic code in rcu_check_boost_fail().  This commit
therefore applies data_race() to this access to avoid KCSAN complaining
about the C-language writes protected by ->lock.
