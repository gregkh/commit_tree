rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Fix initialization of place in _rtl92c_phy_get_rightchnlplace()

Clang warns:

Commit 369956ae5720 ("rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Remove redundant variable
initializations") removed the initialization of place but it appears
that this removal was in the wrong function.

_rtl92c_phy_get_rightchnlplace() returns place's value at the end of the
function so now if the if statement is false, place never gets
initialized. Add that initialization back to address the warning.

place's initialization is not necessary in
rtl92d_get_rightchnlplace_for_iqk() as place is only used within the if
statement so it can be removed, which is likely what was intended in the
first place.
