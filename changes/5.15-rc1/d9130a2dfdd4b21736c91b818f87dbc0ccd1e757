KVM: x86: Update vCPU's hv_clock before back to guest when tsc_offset is adjusted

When MSR_IA32_TSC_ADJUST is written by guest due to TSC ADJUST feature
especially there's a big tsc warp (like a new vCPU is hot-added into VM
which has been up for a long time), tsc_offset is added by a large value
then go back to guest. This causes system time jump as tsc_timestamp is
not adjusted in the meantime and pvclock monotonic character.
To fix this, just notify kvm to update vCPU's guest time before back to
guest.
