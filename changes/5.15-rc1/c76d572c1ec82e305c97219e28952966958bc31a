ASoC: cs42l42: Assume 24-bit samples are in 32-bit slots

If the machine driver doesn't call snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk() the
SCLK is assumed to be sample_rate * sample_bits * 2 (that is, the
rate necessary for a standard I2S frame).

But 24-bit samples can be sent in either a 24-bit slot or a 32-bit
slot. If the PLL is configured for a 24-bit slot, but a 32-bit slot is
used, cs42l42 will be overclocked.

Ultimately it is the machine driver's responsibilty to call
snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk() if SLK will be different from the standard
I2S rate. However, it is convenient to assume 32-bit slots to allow
this common case without needing special machine driver support. The
machine driver then only has to set SCLK if the slots are 24-bit, but
if it fails to do this cs42l42 won't be overclocked.
