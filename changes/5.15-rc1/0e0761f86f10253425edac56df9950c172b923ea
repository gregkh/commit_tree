iio: core: Forbid use of both labels and extended names

Extended names are a problem for user-space as they make the filenames
in sysfs sometimes not parsable. They are now deprecated in favor of
labels.

This change makes sure that a device driver won't provide both labels
and extended names for its channels. It has never been the case and we
don't want it to happen.
