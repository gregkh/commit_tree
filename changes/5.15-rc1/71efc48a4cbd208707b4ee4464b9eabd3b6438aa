perf evsel: Separate rlimit increase from evsel__open_cpu()

This is a preparatory patch for the workqueue patches with the goal to
separate from evlist__open_cpu() the actual opening (which could be
performed in parallel), from the existing fallback mechanisms, which
should be handled sequentially.

This patch separates the rlimit increase from evsel__open_cpu().
