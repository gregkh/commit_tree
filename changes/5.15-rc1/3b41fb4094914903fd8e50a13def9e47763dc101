HID: apple: Add missing scan code event for keys handled by hid-apple

When an EV_KEY event is generated by hid-apple due to special key
mapping, the usual associated scan code event (EV_MSC) is missing.
This issue can be seen with the evtest utility.

Add the scan code event for these special keys.
