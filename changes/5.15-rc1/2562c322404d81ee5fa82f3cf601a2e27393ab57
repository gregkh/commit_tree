xfs: log head and tail aren't reliable during shutdown

I'm seeing assert failures from xlog_space_left() after a shutdown
has begun that look like:

XFS (dm-0): log I/O error -5
XFS (dm-0): xfs_do_force_shutdown(0x2) called from line 1338 of file fs/xfs/xfs_log.c. Return address = xlog_ioend_work+0x64/0xc0
XFS (dm-0): Log I/O Error Detected.
XFS (dm-0): Shutting down filesystem. Please unmount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)

 xfs_trans_reserve+0x18b/0x260
.....

There are two things here. Firstly, after a shutdown, the log head
and tail can be out of whack as things abort and release (or don't
release) resources, so checking them for sanity doesn't make much
sense. Secondly, xfs_log_reserve() can race with shutdown and so it
can still fail like this even though it has already checked for a
log shutdown before calling xlog_grant_push_ail().

So, before ASSERT failing in xlog_space_left(), make sure we haven't
already shut down....
