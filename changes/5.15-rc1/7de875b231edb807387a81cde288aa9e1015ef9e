lockd: lockd server-side shouldn't set fl_ops

Locks have two sets of op arrays, fl_lmops for the lock manager (lockd
or nfsd), fl_ops for the filesystem.  The server-side lockd code has
been setting its own fl_ops, which leads to confusion (and crashes) in
the reexport case, where the filesystem expects to be the only one
setting fl_ops.

And there's no reason for it that I can see-the lm_get/put_owner ops do
the same job.
