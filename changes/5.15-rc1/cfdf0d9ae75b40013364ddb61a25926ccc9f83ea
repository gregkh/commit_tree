rtnetlink: use nlmsg_notify() in rtnetlink_send()

The netlink_{broadcast, unicast} don't deal with 'if (err > 0' statement
but nlmsg_{multicast, unicast} do. The nlmsg_notify() contains them.
so use nlmsg_notify() instead. so that the caller wouldn't deal with
'if (err > 0' statement.

v2: use nlmsg_notify() will do well.
