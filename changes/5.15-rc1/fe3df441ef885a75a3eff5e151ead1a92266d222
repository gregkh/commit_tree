mm: remove redundant compound_head() calling

There is a READ_ONCE() in the macro of compound_head(), which will prevent
compiler from optimizing the code when there are more than once calling of
it in a function.  Remove the redundant calling of compound_head() from
page_to_index() and page_add_file_rmap() for better code generation.
