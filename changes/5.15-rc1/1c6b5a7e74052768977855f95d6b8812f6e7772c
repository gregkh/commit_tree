powerpc/pseries: Add support for FORM2 associativity

PAPR interface currently supports two different ways of communicating resource
grouping details to the OS. These are referred to as Form 0 and Form 1
associativity grouping. Form 0 is the older format and is now considered
deprecated. This patch adds another resource grouping named FORM2.
