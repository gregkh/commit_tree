ksmbd: Return STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND if smb2_creat() returns ENOENT

Both Windows 10's SMB server and samba return STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND
when trying to access a nonexistent path.

This fixes Windows 10 File History tool. The latter relies on the server
returning STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND to figure out what part of the
target path needs to be created. Returning STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_INVALID
will make it stop and display an error to the user.
