drm/vmwgfx: fix potential UAF in vmwgfx_surface.c

drm_file.master should be protected by either drm_device.master_mutex
or drm_file.master_lookup_lock when being dereferenced. However,
drm_master_get is called on unprotected file_priv->master pointers in
vmw_surface_define_ioctl and vmw_gb_surface_define_internal.

This is fixed by replacing drm_master_get with drm_file_get_master.
