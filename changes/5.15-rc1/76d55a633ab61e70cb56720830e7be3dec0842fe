Revert "usb: xhci-mtk: relax TT periodic bandwidth allocation"

As discussed in following patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/12420339

No need calculate number of uframes again, but should use value
form check_sch_tt(), if we plan to remove extra CS, also can do
it in check_sch_tt(). So revert this patch, and prepare to send
new patch for it.

This reverts commit 548011957d1d72e0b662300c8b32b81d593b796e.
