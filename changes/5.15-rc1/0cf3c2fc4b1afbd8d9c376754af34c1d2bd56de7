samples: bpf: Add BPF support for cpumap tracepoints

These are invoked in two places, when the XDP frame or SKB (for generic
XDP) enqueued to the ptr_ring (cpumap_enqueue) and when kthread processes
the frame after invoking the CPUMAP program for it (returning stats for
the batch).

We use cpumap_map_id to filter on the map_id as a way to avoid printing
incorrect stats for parallel sessions of xdp_redirect_cpu.
