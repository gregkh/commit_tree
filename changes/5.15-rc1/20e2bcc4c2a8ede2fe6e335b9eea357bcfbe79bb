RDMA/core: Remove protection from wrong in-kernel API usage

The ib_create_named_qp() is kernel verb that is not used for user supplied
attributes. In such case, it is ULP responsibility to provide valid QP
attributes.

In-kernel API shouldn't check it, exactly like other functions that don't
check device capabilities.
