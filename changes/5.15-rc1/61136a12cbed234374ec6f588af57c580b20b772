USB: EHCI: ehci-mv: improve error handling in mv_ehci_enable()

mv_ehci_enable() did not disable and unprepare clocks in case of
failures of phy_init(). Besides, it did not take into account failures
of ehci_clock_enable() (in effect, failures of clk_prepare_enable()).
The patch fixes both issues and gets rid of redundant wrappers around
clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare() to simplify this a bit.
