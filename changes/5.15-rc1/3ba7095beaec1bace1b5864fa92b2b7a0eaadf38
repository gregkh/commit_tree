perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Sapphire Rapids server IIO support

The IIO stacks are responsible for managing the traffic between the PCI
Express* (PCIe*) domain and the mesh domain. The IIO PMON block is
situated near the IIO stacks traffic controller capturing the traffic
controller as well as the PCIe* root port information.

The layout of the control registers for a IIO uncore unit is a little
bit different from the generic one.
