Revert "cpufreq: intel_pstate: Process HWP Guaranteed change notification"

Revert commit d0e936adbd22 ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Process HWP
Guaranteed change notification"), because it causes a NULL pointer
dereference to occur on Lenovo X1 gen9 laptops due to an HWP
guaranteed performance change interrupt arriving prematurely.

This feature will be revisited in the next cycle.
