scsi: ufs: Fix ufshcd_request_sense_async() for Samsung KLUFG8RHDA-B2D1

Samsung KLUFG8RHDA-B2D1 does not clear the unit attention condition if the
length is zero. So go back to requesting all the sense data, as it was
before patch "scsi: ufs: Request sense data asynchronously". That is
simpler than creating and maintaining a quirk for affected devices.
