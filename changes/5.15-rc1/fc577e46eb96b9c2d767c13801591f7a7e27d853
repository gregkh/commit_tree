staging: r8188eu: remove include/odm_debug.h

Remove include/odm_debug.h in its entirety. To do this, first:

(1) Remove DebugLevel and DebugComponents members from the struct
    odm_dm_struct definition, and any uses of these elsewhere in
    the driver.

(2) Remove the function ODM_InitDebugSetting from hal/odm_debug.c
    whilst leaving the file in place for now as it contains a global
    which is still used and will be removed by further cleanup code.
    Also remove all of its callers. All the function does is set the
    members mentioned above.

(3) Remove the now redundant constants and their usages:
    ODM_CMNINFO_DBG_LEVEL
    ODM_CMNINFO_DBG_COMP
    HW_DEF_ODM_DBG_FLAG
    HW_DEF_FA_CNT_DUMP
    This includes usage within a few hexadecimal ioctl switch cases
    in os_dep/ioctl_linux.c (although only the call itself within
    0x11 as it contains additional code currently).

(4) Finally, remove the file itself and its inclusion within
    include/odm_precomp.h, as none of the remaining content is used
    from anywhere else in the driver.
