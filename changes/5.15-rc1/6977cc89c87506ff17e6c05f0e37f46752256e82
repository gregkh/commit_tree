drm/msm/dsi: Fix some reference counted resource leaks

'of_find_device_by_node()' takes a reference that must be released when
not needed anymore.
This is expected to be done in 'dsi_destroy()'.

However, there are 2 issues in 'dsi_get_phy()'.

First, if 'of_find_device_by_node()' succeeds but 'platform_get_drvdata()'
returns NULL, 'msm_dsi->phy_dev' will still be NULL, and the reference
won't be released in 'dsi_destroy()'.

Secondly, as 'of_find_device_by_node()' already takes a reference, there is
no need for an additional 'get_device()'.

Move the assignment to 'msm_dsi->phy_dev' a few lines above and remove the
unneeded 'get_device()' to solve both issues.
