ARM: 9115/1: mm/maccess: fix unaligned copy_{from,to}_kernel_nofault

On machines such as ARMv5 that trap unaligned accesses, these
two functions can be slow when each access needs to be emulated,
or they might not work at all.

Change them so that each loop is only used when both the src
and dst pointers are naturally aligned.
