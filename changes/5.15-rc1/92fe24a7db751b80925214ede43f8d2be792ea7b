Bluetooth: skip invalid hci_sync_conn_complete_evt

Syzbot reported a corrupted list in kobject_add_internal [1]. This
happens when multiple HCI_EV_SYNC_CONN_COMPLETE event packets with
status 0 are sent for the same HCI connection. This causes us to
register the device more than once which corrupts the kset list.

As this is forbidden behavior, we add a check for whether we're
trying to process the same HCI_EV_SYNC_CONN_COMPLETE event multiple
times for one connection. If that's the case, the event is invalid, so
we report an error that the device is misbehaving, and ignore the
packet.
