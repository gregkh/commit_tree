tty: move tty_port to new tty_port.h

tty.h is long enough already. And I am slowly adding kernel-doc
documentation, so it grows to unmaintainable long mess. To avoid this,
split tty.h further into tty_port.h and move there tty_port-related
declarations and function prototypes (those implemented in tty_port.c).
