io_uring: use kvmalloc for fixed files

Instead of hand-coded two-level tables for registered files, allocate
them with kvmalloc(). In many cases small enough tables are enough, and
so can be kmalloc()'ed removing an extra memory load and a bunch of bit
logic instructions from the hot path. If the table is larger, we trade
off all the pros with a TLB-assisted memory lookup.
