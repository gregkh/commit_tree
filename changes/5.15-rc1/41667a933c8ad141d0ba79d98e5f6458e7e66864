This patch changs interrupt order which found by dtbs_check.

$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/nxp,dwmac-imx.yaml
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mp-evk.dt.yaml: ethernet@30bf0000: interrupt-names:0: 'macirq' was expected
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mp-evk.dt.yaml: ethernet@30bf0000: interrupt-names:1: 'eth_wake_irq' was expected

According to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/snps,dwmac.yaml, we
should list interrupt in it's order.
