mm, slub: stop disabling irqs around get_partial()

The function get_partial() does not need to have irqs disabled as a whole. It's
sufficient to convert spin_lock operations to their irq saving/restoring
versions.

As a result, it's now possible to reach the page allocator from the slab
allocator without disabling and re-enabling interrupts on the way.
