sched: Reject CPU affinity changes based on task_cpu_possible_mask()

Reject explicit requests to change the affinity mask of a task via
set_cpus_allowed_ptr() if the requested mask is not a subset of the
mask returned by task_cpu_possible_mask(). This ensures that the
'cpus_mask' for a given task cannot contain CPUs which are incapable of
executing it, except in cases where the affinity is forced.
