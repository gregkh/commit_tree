KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Make nested HFSCR state accessible

When the L0 runs a nested L2, there are several permutations of HFSCR
that can be relevant. The HFSCR that the L1 vcpu L1 requested, the
HFSCR that the L1 vcpu may use, and the HFSCR that is actually being
used to run the L2.

The L1 requested HFSCR is not accessible outside the nested hcall
handler, so copy that into a new kvm_nested_guest.hfscr field.

The permitted HFSCR is taken from the HFSCR that the L1 runs with,
which is also not accessible while the hcall is being made. Move
this into a new kvm_vcpu_arch.hfscr_permitted field.

These will be used by the next patch to improve facility handling
for nested guests, and later by facility demand faulting patches.
