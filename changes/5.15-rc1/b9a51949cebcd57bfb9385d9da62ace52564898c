KVM: arm64: vgic: Drop WARN from vgic_get_irq

vgic_get_irq(intid) is used all over the vgic code in order to get a
reference to a struct irq. It warns whenever intid is not a valid number
(like when it's a reserved IRQ number). The issue is that this warning
can be triggered from userspace (e.g., KVM_IRQ_LINE for intid 1020).

Drop the WARN call from vgic_get_irq.
