serial: max310x: Use clock-names property matching to recognize EXTCLK

Dennis reported that on ACPI-based systems the clock frequency
isn't enough to configure device properly. We have to respect
the clock source as well. To achieve this match the clock-names
property against "osc" to recognize external clock connection.
On DT-based system this doesn't change anything.
