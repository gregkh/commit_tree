dt-bindings: iio: accel: bma255: Fix interrupt type

Bosch accelerometers similar to BMA255 are initially configured to
emit an active-high interrupt signal. This is currently not re-configured
in the bmc150-accel driver so the interrupt should most certainly be
IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING (or potentially IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH).
(Unless there is some kind of inverter installed on the board...)

At the moment the bmc150-accel driver forcefully requests the IRQ
using IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING, which means that the IRQ type is currently
ignored in all existing device trees.
