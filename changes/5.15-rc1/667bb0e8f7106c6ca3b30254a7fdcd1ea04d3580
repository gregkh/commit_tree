sfc: falcon: Read VPD with pci_vpd_alloc()

Use pci_vpd_alloc() to dynamically allocate a properly sized buffer and
read the full VPD data into it.

This avoids having to allocate a buffer on the stack, and we don't have to
make any assumptions on VPD size and location of information in VPD.

This is the same as 5119e20facfa ("sfc: Read VPD with pci_vpd_alloc()"),
just for the falcon chip version.
