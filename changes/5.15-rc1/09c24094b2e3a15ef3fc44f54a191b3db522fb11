PCI: cadence: Add quirk flag to set minimum delay in LTSSM Detect.Quiet state

PCIe fails to link up if SERDES lanes not used by PCIe are assigned to
another protocol. For example, link training fails if lanes 2 and 3 are
assigned to another protocol while lanes 0 and 1 are used for PCIe to
form a two lane link. This failure is due to an incorrect tie-off on an
internal status signal indicating electrical idle.

Status signals going from SERDES to PCIe Controller are tied-off when a
lane is not assigned to PCIe. Signal indicating electrical idle is
incorrectly tied-off to a state that indicates non-idle. As a result,
PCIe sees unused lanes to be out of electrical idle and this causes
LTSSM to exit Detect.Quiet state without waiting for 12ms timeout to
occur. If a receiver is not detected on the first receiver detection
attempt in Detect.Active state, LTSSM goes back to Detect.Quiet and
again moves forward to Detect.Active state without waiting for 12ms as
required by PCIe base specification. Since wait time in Detect.Quiet is
skipped, multiple receiver detect operations are performed back-to-back
without allowing time for capacitance on the transmit lines to
discharge. This causes subsequent receiver detection to always fail even
if a receiver gets connected eventually.

Add a quirk flag "quirk_detect_quiet_flag" to program the minimum
time the LTSSM should wait on entering Detect.Quiet state here.
This has to be set for J7200 as it has an incorrect tie-off on unused
lanes.
