wcn36xx: Ensure finish scan is not requested before start scan

If the operating channel is the first in the scan list, it was seen that
a finish scan request would be sent before a start scan request was
sent, causing the firmware to fail all future scans. Track the current
channel being scanned to avoid requesting the scan finish before it
starts.
