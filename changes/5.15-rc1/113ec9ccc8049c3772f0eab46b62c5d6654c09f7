powerpc/32: indirect function call use bctrl rather than blrl in ret_from_kernel_thread

Copied from commit 89bbe4c798bc ("powerpc/64: indirect function call
use bctrl rather than blrl in ret_from_kernel_thread")

blrl is not recommended to use as an indirect function call, as it may
corrupt the link stack predictor.

This is not a performance critical path but this should be fixed for
consistency.
