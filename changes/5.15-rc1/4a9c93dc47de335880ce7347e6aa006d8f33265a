selftests/bpf: Test XDP bonding nest and unwind

Modify the test to check that enslaving a bond slave with a XDP program
is now allowed.

Extend attach test to exercise the program unwinding in bond_xdp_set and
add a new test for loading XDP program on doubly nested bond device to
verify that static key incr/decr is correct.
