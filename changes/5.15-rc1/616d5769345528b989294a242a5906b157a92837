IB/mlx5: Rename is_apu_thread_cq function to is_apu_cq

is_apu_thread_cq() used to detect CQs which are attached to APU
threads. This was extended to support other elements as well,
so the function was renamed to is_apu_cq().

c_eqn_or_apu_element was extended from 8 bits to 32 bits, which wan't
reflected when the APU support was first introduced.
