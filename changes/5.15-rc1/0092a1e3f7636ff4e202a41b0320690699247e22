bus: mhi: Add inbound buffers allocation flag

Currently, the MHI controller driver defines which channels should
have their inbound buffers allocated and queued. But ideally, this is
something that should be decided by the MHI device driver instead,
which actually deals with that buffers.

Add a flag parameter to mhi_prepare_for_transfer allowing to specify
if buffers have to be allocated and queued by the MHI stack.

Keep auto_queue flag for now, but should be removed at some point.
