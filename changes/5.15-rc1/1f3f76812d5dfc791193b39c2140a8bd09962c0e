s390/pci: improve DMA translation init and exit

Currently zpci_dma_init_device()/zpci_dma_exit_device() is called as
part of zpci_enable_device()/zpci_disable_device() and errors for
zpci_dma_exit_device() are always ignored even if we could abort.

Improve upon this by moving zpci_dma_exit_device() out of
zpci_disable_device() and check for errors whenever we have a way to
abort the current operation. Note that for example in
zpci_event_hard_deconfigured() the device is expected to be gone so we
really can't abort and proceed even in case of error.

Similarly move the cc == 3 special case out of zpci_unregister_ioat()
and into the callers allowing to abort when finding an already disabled
devices precludes proceeding with the operation.

While we are at it log IOAT register/unregister errors in the s390
debugfs log,
