xfs: grab active perag ref when reading AG headers

This patch prepares scrub to deal with the possibility of tearing down
entire AGs by changing the order of resource acquisition to match the
rest of the XFS codebase.  In other words, scrub now grabs AG resources
in order of: perag structure, then AGI/AGF/AGFL buffers, then btree
cursors; and releases them in reverse order.

This requires us to distinguish xchk_ag_init callers -- some are
responding to a user request to check AG metadata, in which case we can
return ENOENT to userspace; but other callers have an ondisk reference
to an AG that they're trying to cross-reference.  In this second case,
the lack of an AG means there's ondisk corruption, since ondisk metadata
cannot point into nonexistent space.
