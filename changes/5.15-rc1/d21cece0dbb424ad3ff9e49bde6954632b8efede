workqueue: Change the code of calculating work_flags in insert_wq_barrier()

Add a local var @work_flags to calculate work_flags step by step, so that
we don't need to squeeze several flags in only the last line of code.

Parepare for next patch to add a bit to barrier work item's flag.  Not
squshing this to next patch makes it clear that what it will have changed.

No functional change intended.
