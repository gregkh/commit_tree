perf evsel: Handle precise_ip fallback in evsel__open_cpu()

This is another patch in the effort to separate the fallback mechanisms
from the open itself.

In case of precise_ip fallback, the original precise_ip will be stored
in the evsel (it was stored in a local variable) and the open will be
retried. Since the precise_ip fallback will be the first in the chain of
fallbacks, there should be no functional change with this patch.
