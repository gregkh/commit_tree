memcg: fix up drain_local_stock comment

Thomas and Vlastimil have noticed that the comment in drain_local_stock
doesn't quite make sense.  It talks about a synchronization with the
memory hotplug but there is no actual memory hotplug involvement here.  I
meant to talk about cpu hotplug here.  Fix that up and hopefuly make the
comment more helpful by referencing the cpu hotplug callback as well.
