staging: r8188eu: remove empty function rtl8188eu_free_xmit_priv

Remove empty function rtl8188eu_free_xmit_priv from hal/rtl8188eu_xmit.c
and its declaration from include/rtl8188e_xmit.h, as well as the one
place where it is stored in the free_xmit_priv function pointer of the
HalFunc struct inside padapter. This is safe, as the wrapper function
checks for NULL before calling this function via the function pointer.
