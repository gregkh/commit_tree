scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add getfcinfo and statistic bsgs

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

Add two new BSG calls:

 - QL_VND_SC_GET_FCINFO: Application can from time to time request a list
   of all FC ports or a single device that supports secure connection.  If
   driver sees a new or old device has logged into the switch, this call is
   used to check for the WWPN.

 - QL_VND_SC_GET_STATS: Application request for various statistics for each
   FC port.
