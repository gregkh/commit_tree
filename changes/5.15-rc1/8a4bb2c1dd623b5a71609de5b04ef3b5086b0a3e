scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add authentication pass + fail bsgs

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

On completion of the authentication process, the authentication application
will notify driver on whether it is successful or not.

In case of success, application will use the QL_VND_SC_AUTH_OK BSG call to
tell driver to proceed to the PRLI phase.

In case of failure, application will use the QL_VND_SC_AUTH_FAIL bsg call
to tell driver to tear down the connection and retry. In the case where an
existing session is active, the re-key process can fail. The session tear
down ensures data is not further compromised.
