net: ipa: set up the microcontroller earlier

Initializing up the IPA-resident microcontroller requires the IPA
clock, and sets up two IPA interrupt handlers, but this does not
require GSI access.  The interrupt handlers also require the clock
to be enabled, and require the IPA memory regions to be configured,
but neither requires GSI access.  As a result, the microcontroller
can be initialized during the "config" rather than "setup" phase of
IPA initialization.

Initialize the microcontroller in ipa_config() rather than
ipa_setup(), and rename the called function ipa_uc_config().
Do the inverse in ipa_deconfig() rather than ipa_teardown(),
and rename the function for that case ipa_uc_deconfig().
