media: atmel: atmel-sama5d2-isc: fix YUYV format

SAMA5D2 does not have the YCYC field for the RLP (rounding, limiting,
packaging) module.
The YCYC field is supposed to work with interleaved YUV formats like YUYV.
In SAMA5D2, we have to use YYCC field, which is used for both planar
formats like YUV420 and interleaved formats like YUYV.
Fix the according rlp callback to replace the generic YCYC field (which
makes more sense from a logical point of view) with the required YYCC
field.
