habanalabs: disable IRQ in user interrupts spinlock

Because this spinlock is taken in an interrupt handler, we must use
the spin_lock_irqsave/irqrestore version to disable the interrupts
on the local CPU. Otherwise, we can have a potential deadlock (if
the interrupt handler is scheduled to run on the same cpu that the
code who took the lock was running on).
