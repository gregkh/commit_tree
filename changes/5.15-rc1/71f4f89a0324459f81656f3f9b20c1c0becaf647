net: switchdev: recurse into __switchdev_handle_fdb_del_to_device

The difference between __switchdev_handle_fdb_del_to_device and
switchdev_handle_del_to_device is that the former takes an extra
orig_dev argument, while the latter starts with dev == orig_dev.

We should recurse into the variant that does not lose the orig_dev along
the way. This is relevant when deleting FDB entries pointing towards a
bridge (dev changes to the lower interfaces, but orig_dev shouldn't).

The addition helper already recurses properly, just the deletion one
doesn't.
