crypto: hisilicon/sec - modify the hardware endian configuration

When the endian configuration of the hardware is abnormal, it will
cause the SEC engine is faulty that reports empty message. And it
will affect the normal function of the hardware. Currently the soft
configuration method can't restore the faulty device. The endian
needs to be configured according to the system properties. So fix it.
