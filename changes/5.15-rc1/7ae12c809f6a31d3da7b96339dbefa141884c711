fs: inode: count invalidated shadow pages in pginodesteal

pginodesteal is supposed to capture the impact that inode reclaim has on
the page cache state.  Currently, it doesn't consider shadow pages that
get dropped this way, even though this can have a significant impact on
paging behavior, memory pressure calculations etc.

To improve visibility into these effects, make sure shadow pages get
counted when they get dropped through inode reclaim.

This changes the return value semantics of invalidate_mapping_pages()
semantics slightly, but the only two users are the inode shrinker itsel
and a usb driver that logs it for debugging purposes.
