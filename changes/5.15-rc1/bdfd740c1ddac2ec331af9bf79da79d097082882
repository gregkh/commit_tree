s390/qdio: clarify reporting of errors to the drivers

Now that all drivers use qdio_inspect_queue() and qdio's internal
queue tasklets are gone, the driver-specified queue handlers are
only called for async error reporting (eg. for an error condition in
the QEBSM code).

So take a moment to clean up the Output Queue handlers (they are
_always_ called with qdio_error != 0), and clarify which error types
can be reported through what interface. As Benjamin already suggested
a while ago, we should turn these into distinct enums at some point.
