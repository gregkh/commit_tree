mm: introduce memmap_alloc() to unify memory map allocation

There are several places that allocate memory for the memory map:
alloc_node_mem_map() for FLATMEM, sparse_buffer_init() and
__populate_section_memmap() for SPARSEMEM.

The memory allocated in the FLATMEM case is zeroed and it is never
poisoned, regardless of CONFIG_PAGE_POISON setting.

The memory allocated in the SPARSEMEM cases is not zeroed and it is
implicitly poisoned inside memblock if CONFIG_PAGE_POISON is set.

Introduce memmap_alloc() wrapper for memblock allocators that will be used
for both FLATMEM and SPARSEMEM cases and will makei memory map zeroing and
poisoning consistent for different memory models.
