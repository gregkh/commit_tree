perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Sapphire Rapids server UPI support

Sapphire Rapids uses a coherent interconnect for scaling to multiple
sockets known as Intel UPI. Intel UPI technology provides a cache
coherent socket to socket external communication interface between
processors.

The layout of the control registers for a UPI uncore unit is similar to
a M2M uncore unit.
