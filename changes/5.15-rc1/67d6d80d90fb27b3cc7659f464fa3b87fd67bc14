selftests/cpufreq: Rename DEBUG_PI_LIST to DEBUG_PLIST

DEBUG_PI_LIST was renamed to DEBUG_PLIST since
8e18faeac3 ("lib/plist: rename DEBUG_PI_LIST to DEBUG_PLIST")

- It's not reasonable to keep the deprecated configs.
- configs under kselftests are recommended by corresponding tests.
So if some configs are missing, it will impact the testing results
