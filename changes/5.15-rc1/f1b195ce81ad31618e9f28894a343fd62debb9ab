RDMA/bnxt_re: Prefer kcalloc over open coded arithmetic

As noted in the "Deprecated Interfaces, Language Features, Attributes, and
Conventions" documentation [1], size calculations (especially
multiplication) should not be performed in memory allocator (or similar)
function arguments due to the risk of them overflowing. This could lead to
values wrapping around and a smaller allocation being made than the caller
was expecting. Using those allocations could lead to linear overflows of
heap memory and other misbehaviors.

In this case this is not actually dynamic sizes: both sides of the
multiplication are constant values. However it is best to refactor this
anyway, just to keep the open-coded math idiom out of code.

So, use the purpose specific kcalloc() function instead of the argument
size * count in the kzalloc() function.

Also, remove the unnecessary initialization of the sqp_tbl variable since
it is set a few lines later.
