scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Prepare HPB read for cached sub-region

If the logical address of a read I/O belongs to an active sub-region, the
HPB driver modifies the read I/O command to an HPB read. The driver
modifies the UFS UPIU instead of modifying the existing SCSI command.

In HPB version 1.0, the maximum read I/O size that can be converted to HPB
read is 4KB.

The dirty map of the active sub-region prevents an incorrect HPB read that
has stale physical page number which is updated by previous write I/O.
