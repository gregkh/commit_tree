net: dsa: b53: Set correct number of ports in the DSA struct

Setting DSA_MAX_PORTS caused DSA to call b53 callbacks (e.g.
b53_disable_port() during dsa_register_switch()) for invalid
(non-existent) ports. That made b53 modify unrelated registers and is
one of reasons for a broken BCM5301x support.

This problem exists for years but DSA_MAX_PORTS usage has changed few
times. It seems the most accurate to reference commit dropping
dsa_switch_alloc() in the Fixes tag.
