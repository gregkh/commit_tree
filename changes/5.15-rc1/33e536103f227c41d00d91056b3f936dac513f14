perf doc: Remove references to user-manual

Perf doesn't have a user-manual.txt, but git does and this explains why
there are references here. Having these references breaks 'make info' as
user-manual.info can't be created given the missing dependency. Remove
all references to user-manual so that 'make info' can succeed.
