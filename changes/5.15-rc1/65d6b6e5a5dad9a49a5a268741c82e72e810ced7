net/mlx5e: Move management of indir traffic types to rx_res

This commit moves the responsibility of keeping the RSS configuration
for different traffic types to en/rx_res.{c,h}, hiding the
implementation details behind the new getters, and abandons all usage of
struct mlx5e_tirc_config, which is no longer useful and superseded by
struct mlx5e_rss_params_traffic_type.
