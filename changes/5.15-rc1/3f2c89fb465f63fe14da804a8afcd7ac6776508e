Bluetooth: serialize calls to sco_sock_{set,clear}_timer

Currently, calls to sco_sock_set_timer are made under the locked
socket, but this does not apply to all calls to sco_sock_clear_timer.

Both sco_sock_{set,clear}_timer should be serialized by lock_sock to
prevent unexpected concurrent clearing/setting of timers.

Additionally, since sco_pi(sk)->conn is only cleared under the locked
socket, this change allows us to avoid races between
sco_sock_clear_timer and the call to kfree(conn) in sco_conn_del.
