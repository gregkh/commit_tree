drm/i915/guc: Capture error state on context reset

We receive notification of an engine reset from GuC at its
completion. Meaning GuC has potentially cleared any HW state
we may have been interested in capturing. GuC resumes scheduling
on the engine post-reset, as the resets are meant to be transparent,
further muddling our error state.

There is ongoing work to define an API for a GuC debug state dump. The
suggestion for now is to manually disable FW initiated resets in cases
where debug state is needed.
