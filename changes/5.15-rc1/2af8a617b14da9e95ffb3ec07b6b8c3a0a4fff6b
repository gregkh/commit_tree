ARM: dts: imx6q-dhcom: Add the parallel system bus

Add the parallel system bus provided by the i.MX6 WEIM interface via an
address latch. The OE pin of the latch is controlled by a fixed regulator.
The pin is low active. This is ensured by omitting the regulators property
enable-active-high. The flags value of the gpio property (3rd value), which
is also use to define active high/low, is set to 0 because it is ignored
by gpiolib-of.c.
