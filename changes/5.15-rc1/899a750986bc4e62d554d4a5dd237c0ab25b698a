soundwire: bus: update Slave status in sdw_clear_slave_status

Call to sdw_update_slave_status() needs to be added to sdw_clear_slave_
status() to ensure Slaves are informed of the new status via update_
status() callback.

This will enable codec drivers to reset their internal states and make
sure the register settings are properly restored on pm_runtime or
system resume
