KVM: SVM: Zero out GDTR.base and IDTR.base on INIT

Explicitly set GDTR.base and IDTR.base to zero when intializing the VMCB.
Functionally this only affects INIT, as the bases are implicitly set to
zero on RESET by virtue of the VMCB being zero allocated.

Per AMD's APM, GDTR.base and IDTR.base are zeroed after RESET and INIT.
