spi: mxic: patch for octal DTR mode support

Driver patch for octal DTR mode support.

Owing to the spi_mem_default_supports_op() is not support dtr
operation. Based on commit <539cf68cd51b> (spi: spi-mem: add
spi_mem_dtr_supports_op()) add spi_mem_dtr_supports_op()
to support dtr and keep checking the buswidth and command bytes.
