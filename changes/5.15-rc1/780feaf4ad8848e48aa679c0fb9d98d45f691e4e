ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix HP ElitePad 1000 G2 quirk

The HP Elitepad 1000 G2 has 2 headset jacks:

1. on the dock which uses the output of the codecs built-in HP-amp +
the standard IN2 input which is always used with the headset-jack.

2. on the tablet itself, this uses the line-out of the codec, combined
with an external HP-amp + IN1 for the headset-mic.

Fix the HP ElitePad 1000 G2 to properly reflect this now that the
machine-driver supports this setup.

Note this also changes the mapping for the internal mic. from
IN1 (which was pointing to the 2nd headset-jack mic) to DMIC2
which is the actual input for the internal mics.
