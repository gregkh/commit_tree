nbd: only return usable devices from nbd_find_unused

Device marked as NBD_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT can and should be skipped
given that they won't survive the disconnect.  So skip them and try
to grab a reference directly and just continue if the the devices
is being torn down or created and thus has a zero refcount.
