fsnotify: fix sb_connectors leak

Fix a leak in s_fsnotify_connectors counter in case of a race between
concurrent add of new fsnotify mark to an object.

The task that lost the race fails to drop the counter before freeing
the unused connector.

Following umount() hangs in fsnotify_sb_delete()/wait_var_event(),
because s_fsnotify_connectors never drops to zero.
