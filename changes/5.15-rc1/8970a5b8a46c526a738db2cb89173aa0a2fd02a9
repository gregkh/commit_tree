xfs: consolidate mount option features in m_features

This provides separation of mount time feature flags from runtime
mount flags and mount option state. It also makes the feature
checks use the same interface as the superblock features. i.e. we
don't care if the feature is enabled by superblock flags or mount
options, we just care if it's enabled or not.
