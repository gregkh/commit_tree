Revert "memcg: enable accounting for file lock caches"

This reverts commit 0f12156dff2862ac54235fc72703f18770769042.

The kernel test robot reports a sizeable performance regression for this
commit, and while it clearly does the rigth thing in theory, we'll need
to look at just how to avoid or minimize the performance overhead of the
memcg accounting.

People already have suggestions on how to do that, but it's "future
work".

So revert it for now.
