vfio/pci: Rename vfio_pci_device to vfio_pci_core_device

This is a preparation patch for separating the vfio_pci driver to a
subsystem driver and a generic pci driver. This patch doesn't change any
logic.

The new vfio_pci_core_device structure will be the main structure of the
core driver and later on vfio_pci_device structure will be the main
structure of the generic vfio_pci driver.
