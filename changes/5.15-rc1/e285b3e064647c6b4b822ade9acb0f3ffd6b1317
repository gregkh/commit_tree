mmc: sdio: Print contents of unknown CIS tuples

Print out the contents of the offending tuples when we do print them.
This can make it easier to debug, since these tuples are not exposed to
userspace anywhere else. We are limited to 64 bytes, so keep printing
out the full length in case the tuple is truncated.
