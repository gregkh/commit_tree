octeontx2-af: Change the order of queue work and interrupt disable

Clear and disable interrupt before queueing work as there might be
a chance that work gets completed on other core faster and
interrupt enable as a part of the work completes before
interrupt disable in the interrupt context. This leads to
permanent disable of interrupt.
