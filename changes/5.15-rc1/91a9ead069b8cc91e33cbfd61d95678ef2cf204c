drm/amd/display: Fixed EdidUtility build errors

[HOW]
Added #ifdefs and refactored various parts of dc to
allow dc_link to be built by AMD EDID UTILITY

[WHY]
dc_dsc was refactored moving some of the code that AMD EDID UTILITY needed
to dc_link, so now dc_link needs to be included by AMD EDID UTILITY

Squash in DCN config fix (Alex)
