ata: sata_dwc_460ex: No need to call phy_exit() befre phy_init()

Last change to device managed APIs cleaned up error path to simple phy_exit()
call, which in some cases has been executed with NULL parameter. This per se
is not a problem, but rather logical misconception: no need to free resource
when it's for sure has not been allocated yet. Fix the driver accordingly.
