ceph: remove the capsnaps when removing caps

capsnaps will take inode references via ihold when queueing to flush.
When force unmounting, the client will just close the sessions and
may never get a flush reply, causing a leak and inode ref leak.

Fix this by removing the capsnaps for an inode when removing the caps.
