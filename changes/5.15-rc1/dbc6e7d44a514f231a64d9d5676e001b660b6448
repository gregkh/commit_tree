nilfs2: fix NULL pointer in nilfs_##name##_attr_release

In nilfs_##name##_attr_release, kobj->parent should not be referenced
because it is a NULL pointer.  The release() method of kobject is always
called in kobject_put(kobj), in the implementation of kobject_put(), the
kobj->parent will be assigned as NULL before call the release() method.
So just use kobj to get the subgroups, which is more efficient and can fix
a NULL pointer reference problem.
