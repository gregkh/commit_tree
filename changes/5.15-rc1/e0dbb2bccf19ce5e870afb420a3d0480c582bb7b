include/linux/mmzone.h: avoid a warning in sparse memory support

cppcheck warns that we're possibly losing information by shifting an int.
It's a false positive, because we don't allow for a NUMA node ID that
large, but if we ever change SECTION_NID_SHIFT, it could become a problem,
and in any case this is usually a legitimate warning.  Fix it by adding
the necessary cast, which makes the compiler generate the right code.
