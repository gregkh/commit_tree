soc/tegra: fuse: Enable fuse clock on suspend for Tegra124

The FUSE clock should be enabled during suspend on Tegra124. Currently
clk driver enables it on all SoCs, but FUSE may require a higher core
voltage on Tegra30 while enabled. Move the quirk into the FUSE driver
and make it specific to Tegra124.
