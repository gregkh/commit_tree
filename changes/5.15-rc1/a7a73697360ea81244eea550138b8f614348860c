kcsan: Remove CONFIG_KCSAN_DEBUG

By this point CONFIG_KCSAN_DEBUG is pretty useless, as the system just
isn't usable with it due to spamming console (I imagine a randconfig
test robot will run into this sooner or later). Remove it.

Back in 2019 I used it occasionally to record traces of watchpoints and
verify the encoding is correct, but these days we have proper tests. If
something similar is needed in future, just add it back ad-hoc.
