x86/resctrl: Merge the CDP resources

resctrl uses struct rdt_resource to describe the available hardware
resources. The domains of the CDP aliases share a single ctrl_val[]
array. The only differences between the struct rdt_hw_resource aliases
is the name and conf_type.

The name from struct rdt_hw_resource is visible to user-space. To
support another architecture, as many user-visible details should be
handled in the filesystem parts of the code that is common to all
architectures. The name and conf_type go together.

Remove conf_type and the CDP aliases. When CDP is supported and enabled,
schemata_list_create() can create two schemata using the single
resource, generating the CODE/DATA suffix to the schema name itself.

This allows the alloc_ctrlval_array() and complications around free()ing
the ctrl_val arrays to be removed.
