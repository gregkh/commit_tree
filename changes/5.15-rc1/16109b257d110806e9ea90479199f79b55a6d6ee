dt-bindings: memory: convert H8/300 bus controller to dtschema

Convert H8/300 bus controller bindings to DT schema format using
json-schema.

The conversion also extends the bindings to match what is really used in
existing devicetree sources (the original file mentions only
"renesas,h8300-bsc" but "renesas,h8300h-bsc" and "renesas,h8s-bsc" are
used with it).
