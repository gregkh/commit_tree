mctp: Specify route types, require rtm_type in RTM_*ROUTE messages

This change adds a 'type' attribute to routes, which can be parsed from
a RTM_NEWROUTE message. This will help to distinguish local vs. peer
routes in a future change.

This means userspace will need to set a correct rtm_type in RTM_NEWROUTE
and RTM_DELROUTE messages; we currently only accept RTN_UNICAST.
