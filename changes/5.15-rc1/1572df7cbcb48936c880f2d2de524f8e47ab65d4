mm, slub: restructure new page checks in ___slab_alloc()

When we allocate slab object from a newly acquired page (from node's partial
list or page allocator), we usually also retain the page as a new percpu slab.
There are two exceptions - when pfmemalloc status of the page doesn't match our
gfp flags, or when the cache has debugging enabled.

The current code for these decisions is not easy to follow, so restructure it
and add comments. The new structure will also help with the following changes.
No functional change.
