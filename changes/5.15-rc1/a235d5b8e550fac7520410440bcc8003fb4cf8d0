ALSA: hda: Allow model option to specify PCI SSID alias

There are tons of quirks for HD-audio and many of them are without
model string, hence it's not trivial to apply the same quirk for a new
device.  This patch makes it easier: namely, the model string accepts
a form as "XXXX:YYYY" (a pair of hex numbers of the subsystem-vendor
and subsystem-device IDs), to specify the alias of PCI (or codec)
SSID.  e.g. passing model=1234:abcd would apply the quirk that matches
with the given SSID 1234:abcd instead of the actual SSID.
