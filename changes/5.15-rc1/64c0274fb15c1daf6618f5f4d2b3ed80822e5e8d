drm/dp: Don't zero PWMGEN_BIT_COUNT when driver_pwm_freq_hz not specified

The function drm_edp_backlight_init() is defined such that the
"driver_pwm_freq_hz" parameter is optional--it's 0 if you don't want
to futz with it. If you follow this variable through, you'll find out
that if it's 0 we won't ever set the "bl->pwmgen_bit_count", leaving
it as 0.

That means that before using it in drm_edp_backlight_enable() we need
to check to see if it's non-zero.

Programming this field to zero was confusing the panel I tested with
(Samsung ATNA33XC20). The backlight still worked somewhat but the
brightness values didn't correspond to what they should have been.
