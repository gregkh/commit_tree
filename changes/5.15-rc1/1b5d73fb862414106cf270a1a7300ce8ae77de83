igc: Enable PCIe PTM

Enables PCIe PTM (Precision Time Measurement) support in the igc
driver. Notifies the PCI devices that PCIe PTM should be enabled.

PCIe PTM is similar protocol to PTP (Precision Time Protocol) running
in the PCIe fabric, it allows devices to report time measurements from
their internal clocks and the correlation with the PCIe root clock.

The i225 NIC exposes some registers that expose those time
measurements, those registers will be used, in later patches, to
implement the PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE ioctl().
