io_uring: Add register support for non-4k PAGE_SIZE

Now allocated rsrc table uses PAGE_SIZE as the size of 2nd-level, and
accessing this table relies on each level index from fixed TABLE_SHIFT
(12 - 3) in 4k page case. In order to correctly work in non-4k page,
define TABLE_SHIFT as non-fixed (PAGE_SHIFT - shift of data) for
2nd-level table entry number.
