libbpf: Re-build libbpf.so when libbpf.map changes

Ensure libbpf.so is re-built whenever libbpf.map is modified.  Without this,
changes to libbpf.map are not detected and versioned symbols mismatch error
will be reported until `make clean && make` is used, which is a suboptimal
developer experience.
