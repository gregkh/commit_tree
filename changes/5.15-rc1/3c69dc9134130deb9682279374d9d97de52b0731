ALSA: usb-audio: Move ignore_ctl_error check into quirk_flags

The mixer code has a flag ignore_ctl_error for ignoring the errors
returned from the device wrt mixer accesses, and this is set from the
entries in mixer_maps.c, as well as ignore_ctl_error module option.
Those can be well integrated into the new quirk_flags field, too.
