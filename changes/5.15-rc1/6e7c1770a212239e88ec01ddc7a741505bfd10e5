fs: simplify get_filesystem_list / get_all_fs_names

Just output the '\0' separate list of supported file systems for block
devices directly rather than going through a pointless round of string
manipulation.

Based on an earlier patch from Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>.

Vivek:
Modified list_bdev_fs_names() and split_fs_names() to return number of
null terminted strings to caller. Callers now use that information to
loop through all the strings instead of relying on one extra null char
being present at the end.
