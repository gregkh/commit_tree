PCI: Add schedule point in proc_bus_pci_read()

PCI configuration space reads from /proc/bus/pci can often take several
milliseconds to complete.

Add a schedule point in proc_bus_pci_read() to reduce the maximum latency.

A similar change was made for sysfs by 2ce02a864ac1 ("PCI: Add schedule
point in pci_read_config()").
