scftorture: Avoid NULL pointer exception on early exit

When scftorture finds an error in the module parameters controlling
the relative frequencies of smp_call_function*() variants, it takes an
early exit.  So early that it has not allocated memory to track the
kthreads running the test, which results in a segfault.  This commit
therefore checks for the existence of the memory before attempting
to stop the kthreads that would otherwise have been recorded in that
non-existent memory.
