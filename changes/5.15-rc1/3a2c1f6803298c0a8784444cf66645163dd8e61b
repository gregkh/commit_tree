scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Add host control mode support to rsp_upiu

In device control mode, the device may recommend the host to either
activate or inactivate a region, and the host should follow. Meaning those
are not actually recommendations, but more of instructions.

Conversely, in host control mode, the recommendation protocol is slightly
changed:

 a) The device may only recommend the host to update a subregion of an
    already-active region. And,

 b) The device may *not* recommend to inactivate a region.

Furthermore, in host control mode, the host may choose not to follow any of
the device's recommendations. However, in case of a recommendation to
update an active and clean subregion, it is better to follow those
recommendation because otherwise the host has no other way to know that
some internal relocation took place.
