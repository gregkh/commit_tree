drm: add lockdep assert to drm_is_current_master_locked

In drm_is_current_master_locked, accessing drm_file.master should be
protected by either drm_file.master_lookup_lock or
drm_device.master_mutex. This was previously awkward to assert with
lockdep.

Following patch ("locking/lockdep: Provide lockdep_assert{,_once}()
helpers"), this assertion is now convenient. So we add in the
assertion and explain this lock design in the kerneldoc.
