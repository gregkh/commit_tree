cxgb4: improve printing NIC information

Currently the interface name and PCI address are printed twice, because
netdev_info() is printing this information implicitly already. This results
in messages like the following. remove the duplicated information.

cxgb4 0000:81:00.4 eth3: eth3: Chelsio T6225-OCP-SO (0000:81:00.4) 1G/10G/25GBASE-SFP28
