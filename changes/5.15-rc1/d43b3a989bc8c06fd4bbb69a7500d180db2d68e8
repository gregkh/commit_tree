soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Use corner in power_off

rpmhpd_aggregate_corner() takes a corner as parameter, but in
rpmhpd_power_off() the code requests the level of the first corner
instead.

In all (known) current cases the first corner has level 0, so this
change should be a nop, but in case that there's a power domain with a
non-zero lowest level this makes sure that rpmhpd_power_off() actually
requests the lowest level - which is the closest to "power off" we can
get.

While touching the code, also skip the unnecessary zero-initialization
of "ret".
