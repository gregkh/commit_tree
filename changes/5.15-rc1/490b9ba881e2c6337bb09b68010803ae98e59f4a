kernel/pid.c: implement additional checks upon pidfd_create() parameters

By adding the pidfd_create() declaration to linux/pid.h, we
effectively expose this function to the rest of the kernel. In order
to avoid any unintended behavior, or set false expectations upon this
function, ensure that constraints are forced upon each of the passed
parameters. This includes the checking of whether the passed struct
pid is a thread-group leader as pidfd creation is currently limited to
such pid types.
