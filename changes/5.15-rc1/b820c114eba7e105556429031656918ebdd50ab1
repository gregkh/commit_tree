net: fec: fix MAC internal delay doesn't work

This patch intends to fix MAC internal delay doesn't work, due to use
of_property_read_u32() incorrectly, and improve this feature a bit:
1) check the delay value if valid, only program register when it's 2000ps.
2) only enable "enet_2x_txclk" clock when require MAC internal delay.
