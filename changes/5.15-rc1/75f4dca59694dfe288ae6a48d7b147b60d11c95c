block: call blk_register_queue earlier in device_add_disk

Ensure that all the sysfs bits are set up before bdev_add is called,
as that will make the upcomding error handling much easier.  However
this means the call to disk_update_readahead has to be split as that
requires a bdi.  Also remove various sanity checks that don't make
sense now that blk_register_queue only has a single caller.
