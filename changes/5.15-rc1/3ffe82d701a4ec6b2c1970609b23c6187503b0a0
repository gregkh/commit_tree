drm/i915/xehp: handle new steering options

Xe_HP is more modular than its predecessors and as a consequence it has
more types of replicated registers.  As with l3bank regions on previous
platforms, we may need to explicitly re-steer accesses to these new
types of ranges at runtime if we can't find a single default steering
value that satisfies the fusing of all types.

v2:
 - Add a local 'i915' variable to reduce gt->i915 usage.  (Caz)
 - Drop unused 'intel_gt_read_register' prototype.  (Caz)

v3:
 - Drop unnecessary comment text.  (Lucas)
 - Drop unused register bit definition.  (Lucas)
