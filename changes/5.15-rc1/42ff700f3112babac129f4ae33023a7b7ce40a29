coresight: syscfg: Add registration and feature loading for cs devices

API for individual devices to register with the syscfg management
system is added.

Devices register with matching information, and any features or
configurations that match will be loaded into the device.

The feature and configuration loading is extended so that on load these
are loaded into any currently registered devices. This allows
configuration loading after devices have been registered.
