xfs: reflect sb features in xfs_mount

Currently on-disk feature checks require decoding the superblock
fileds and so can be non-trivial. We have almost 400 hundred
individual feature checks in the XFS code, so this is a significant
amount of code. To reduce runtime check overhead, pre-process all
the version flags into a features field in the xfs_mount at mount
time so we can convert all the feature checks to a simple flag
check.

There is also a need to convert the dynamic feature flags to update
the m_features field. This is required for attr, attr2 and quota
features. New xfs_mount based wrappers are added for this.
