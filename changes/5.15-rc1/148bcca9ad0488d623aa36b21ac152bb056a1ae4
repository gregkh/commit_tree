soc: renesas: Prefer memcpy() over strcpy()

strcpy() performs no bounds checking on the destination buffer. This
could result in linear overflows beyond the end of the buffer, leading
to all kinds of misbehaviors. So, use memcpy() as a safe replacement.

This is a previous step in the path to remove the strcpy() function
entirely from the kernel.
