scsi: smartpqi: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having a
dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use "flexible array members"[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code a bit according to the use of a flexible-array member in
struct pqi_event_config instead of a one-element array, and use the
struct_size() helper.

This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds and
get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines on
memcpy().

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle and audited and fixed,
manually.
