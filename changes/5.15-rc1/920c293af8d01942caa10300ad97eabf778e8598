arm64: dts: sparx5: Add the Sparx5 switch frame DMA support

This adds the interrupt for the Sparx5 Frame DMA.

If this configuration is present the Sparx5 SwitchDev driver will use the
Frame DMA feature, and if not it will use register based injection and
extraction for sending and receiving frames to the CPU.
