MIPS: DTS: Pistachio add missing cpc and cdmm

CPC and CDMM addresses are adjustable and we should tell kernel
how to place them in devicetree.

Note that MACH_PISTACHIO code hardcoded CDMM base to 0x1bdd0000,
however it will collide with GIC address range. As we don't have
any CDMM device on this platform it won't be a problem.
I found another spare range, 0x1bdf0000~0x1be00000 to place CDMM
instead.
