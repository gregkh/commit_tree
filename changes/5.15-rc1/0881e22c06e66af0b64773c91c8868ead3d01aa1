usb: phy: twl6030: add IRQ checks

The driver neglects to check the result of platform_get_irq()'s calls and
blithely passes the negative error codes to request_threaded_irq() (which
takes *unsigned* IRQ #), causing them both to fail with -EINVAL, overriding
an original error code.  Stop calling request_threaded_irq() with the
invalid IRQ #s.
