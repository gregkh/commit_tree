KVM: arm64: Expose page-table helpers

The KVM pgtable API exposes the kvm_pgtable_walk() function to allow
the definition of walkers outside of pgtable.c. However, it is not easy
to implement any of those walkers without some of the low-level helpers.
Move some of them to the header file to allow re-use from other places.
