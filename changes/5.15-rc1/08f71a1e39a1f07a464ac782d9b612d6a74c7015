selftests/bpf: Check inner map deletion

Add a test case to check whether an unsuccessful creation of an outer
map of a BTF-defined map-in-map destroys the inner map.

As bpf_object__create_map() is a static function, we cannot just call it
from the test case and then check whether a map accessible via
map->inner_map_fd has been closed. Instead, we iterate over all maps and
check whether the map "$MAP_NAME.inner" does not exist.
