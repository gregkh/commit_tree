PCI/PTM: Remove error message at boot

Since 39850ed51062 ("PCI/PTM: Save/restore Precision Time Measurement
Capability for suspend/resume"), devices that have PTM capability but
don't enable it see this message on calls to pci_save_state():

  no suspend buffer for PTM

Drop the message, it's perfectly fine not to use a capability.
