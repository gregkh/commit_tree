kbuild: Remove -Wno-format-invalid-specifier from clang block

Turning on -Wformat does not reveal any instances of this warning across
several different builds so remove this line to keep the number of
disabled warnings as slim as possible.

This has been disabled since commit 61163efae020 ("kbuild: LLVMLinux:
Add Kbuild support for building kernel with Clang"), which does not
explain exactly why it was turned off but since it was so long ago in
terms of both the kernel and LLVM so it is possible that some bug got
fixed along the way.
