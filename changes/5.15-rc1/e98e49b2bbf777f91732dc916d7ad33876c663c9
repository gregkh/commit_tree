io_uring: extend task put optimisations

Now with IRQ completions done via IRQ, almost all requests freeing
are done from the context of submitter task, so it makes sense to
extend task_put optimisation from io_req_free_batch_finish() to cover
all the cases including task_work by moving it into io_put_task().
