drm/i915: Hold reference to intel_context over life of i915_request

Hold a reference to the intel_context over life of an i915_request.
Without this an i915_request can exist after the context has been
destroyed (e.g. request retired, context closed, but user space holds a
reference to the request from an out fence). In the case of GuC
submission + virtual engine, the engine that the request references is
also destroyed which can trigger bad pointer dref in fence ops (e.g.
i915_fence_get_driver_name). We could likely change
i915_fence_get_driver_name to avoid touching the engine but let's just
be safe and hold the intel_context reference.

    virtual engines differently
