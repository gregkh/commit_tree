xen/pcifront: Removed unnecessary __ref annotation

An unnecessary "__ref" annotation was removed from the
"drivers/pci/xen_pcifront.c" file. The function where the annotation
was used was "pcifront_backend_changed()", which does not call any
functions annotated as "__*init" nor "__*exit". This makes "__ref"
unnecessary since this annotation is used to make the compiler ignore
section miss-matches when they are not happening here in the first
place.

In addition to the aforementioned change, some code style issues were
fixed in the same file.
