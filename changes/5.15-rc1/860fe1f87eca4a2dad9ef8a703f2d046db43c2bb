net: dpaa2-switch: call dpaa2_switch_port_disconnect_mac on probe error path

Currently when probing returns an error, the netdev is freed but
phylink_disconnect is not called.

Create a common function between the unbind path and the error path,
call it the opposite of dpaa2_switch_probe_port: dpaa2_switch_remove_port,
and call it from both the unbind and the error path.
