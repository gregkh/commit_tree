x86/resctrl: Move the schemata names into struct resctrl_schema

resctrl 'info' directories and schema parsing use the schema name.
This lives in the struct rdt_resource, and is specified by the
architecture code.

Once the CDP resources are merged, there will only be one resource (and
one name) in use by two schemata. To allow the CDP CODE/DATA property to
be the type of configuration the schema uses, the name should also be
per-schema.

Add a name field to struct resctrl_schema, and use this wherever
the schema name is exposed (or read from) user-space. Calculating
max_name_width for padding the schemata file also moves as this is
visible to user-space. As the names in struct rdt_resource already
include the CDP information, schemata_list_create() copies them.

schemata_list_create() includes the length of the CDP suffix when
calculating max_name_width in preparation for CDP resources being
merged.
