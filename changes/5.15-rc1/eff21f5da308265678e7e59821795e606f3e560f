PCI: tegra: Fix OF node reference leak

Commit 9e38e690ace3 ("PCI: tegra: Fix OF node reference leak") has fixed
some node reference leaks in this function but missed some of them.

In fact, having 'port' referenced in the 'rp' structure is not enough to
prevent the leak, until 'rp' is actually added in the 'pcie->ports' list.

Add the missing 'goto err_node_put' accordingly.
