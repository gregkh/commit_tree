scsi: mpt3sas: Introduce sas_ncq_prio_supported sysfs sttribute

Similarly to AHCI, introduce the device sysfs attribute
sas_ncq_prio_supported to advertise if a SATA device supports the NCQ
priority feature. Without this new attribute, the user can only discover if
a SATA device supports NCQ priority by trying to enable the feature use
with the sas_ncq_prio_enable sysfs device attribute, which fails when the
device does not support high prioity commands.
