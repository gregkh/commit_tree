ARM: dts: meson: Add the AIU audio controller

Add the AIU audio controller to the Amlogic Meson6/8/8b/8m2 SoC DT. This
provides I2S and SPDIF outputs as well as codec glues for the internal
HDMI controller.
Also add the clock inputs and pin mux definitions on Meson8/8b/8m2. On
Meson6 this is omitted because we neither have a clock nor pin
controller node there yet.
