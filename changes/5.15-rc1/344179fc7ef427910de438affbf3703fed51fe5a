ARM: 9106/1: traps: use get_kernel_nofault instead of set_fs()

ARM uses set_fs() and __get_user() to allow the stack dumping code to
access possibly invalid pointers carefully. These can be changed to the
simpler get_kernel_nofault(), and allow the eventual removal of set_fs().

dump_instr() will print either kernel or user space pointers,
depending on how it was called. For dump_mem(), I assume we are only
interested in kernel pointers, and the only time that this is called
with user_mode(regs)==true is when the regs themselves are unreliable
as a result of the condition that caused the trap.
