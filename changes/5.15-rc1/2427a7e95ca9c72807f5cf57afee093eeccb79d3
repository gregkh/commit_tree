iio: light: adjd_s311: move buffer on adjd_s311_data object

This change moves the entire buffer on the private adjd_s311_data type.
Since the device has 4 channels, it's not a big waste to just allocate the
maximum possible buffer and use only what's needed.

This is in contrast with free-ing and re-allocating the buffer on the
update_scan_mode hook.

Since the driver pushes buffer data with
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp(), the buffer must also include a
64-bit buffer for the timestamp, for each sample-set.

With this change, the adjd_s311_update_scan_mode() is no longer needed.
