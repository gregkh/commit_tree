af_unix: Add unix_stream_proto for sockmap

Previously, sockmap for AF_UNIX protocol only supports
dgram type. This patch add unix stream type support, which
is similar to unix_dgram_proto. To support sockmap, dgram
and stream cannot share the same unix_proto anymore, because
they have different implementations, such as unhash for stream
type (which will remove closed or disconnected sockets from the map),
so rename unix_proto to unix_dgram_proto and add a new
unix_stream_proto.

Also implement stream related sockmap functions.
And add dgram key words to those dgram specific functions.
