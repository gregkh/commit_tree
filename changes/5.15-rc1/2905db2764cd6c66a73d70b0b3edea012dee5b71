drm/panfrost: Don't reset the GPU on job faults unless we really have to

If we can recover from a fault without a reset there's no reason to
issue one.

v3:
* Drop the mention of Valhall requiring a reset on JOB_BUS_FAULT
* Set the fence error to -EINVAL instead of having per-exception
  error codes
