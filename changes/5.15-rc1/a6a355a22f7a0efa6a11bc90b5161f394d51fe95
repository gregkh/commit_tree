drm/amdgpu: Fixes to returning VBIOS RAS EEPROM address

1) Generalize the function--if the user didn't set
   i2c_address, still return true/false to
   indicate whether VBIOS contains the RAS EEPROM
   address.  This function shouldn't evaluate
   whether the user set the i2c_address pointer or
   not.

2) Don't touch the caller's i2c_address, unless
   you have to--this function shouldn't have side
   effects.

3) Correctly set the function comment as a
   kernel-doc comment.
