PCI: Set dma-can-stall for HiSilicon chips

HiSilicon KunPeng920 and KunPeng930 have devices that appear as PCI but are
actually on the AMBA bus. These fake PCI devices can support SVA via the
SMMU stall feature.

DT systems can indicate this in the device tree, but ACPI systems don't
have that mechanism, so add a "dma-can-stall" property manually for them.
