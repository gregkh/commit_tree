sock: remove one redundant SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER macro

Both SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER are defined to the same value in
net/core/sock.c and drivers/vhost/net.c.

Move the SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER definition to net/core/sock.h,
as both net/core/sock.c and drivers/vhost/net.c include it,
and it seems a reasonable file to put the macro.
