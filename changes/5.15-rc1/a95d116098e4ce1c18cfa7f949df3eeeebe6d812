drm/i915/guc: Direct all breadcrumbs for a class to single breadcrumbs

With GuC virtual engines the physical engine which a request executes
and completes on isn't known to the i915. Therefore we can't attach a
request to a physical engines breadcrumbs. To work around this we create
a single breadcrumbs per engine class when using GuC submission and
direct all physical engine interrupts to this breadcrumbs.

  - Rework header file structure so intel_engine_mask_t can be in
    intel_engine_types.h
