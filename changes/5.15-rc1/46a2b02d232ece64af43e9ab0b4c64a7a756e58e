arm64: entry: consolidate entry/exit helpers

To make the various entry/exit helpers easier to understand and easier
to compare, this patch moves all the entry/exit helpers to be adjacent
at the top of entry-common.c, rather than being spread out throughout
the file.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
