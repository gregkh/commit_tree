ARM: 8668/1: ftrace: Fix dynamic ftrace with DEBUG_RODATA and !FRAME_POINTER

The support for dynamic ftrace with CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA involves
overriding the weak arch_ftrace_update_code() with a variant which makes
the kernel text writable around the patching.

This override was however added under the CONFIG_OLD_MCOUNT ifdef, and
CONFIG_OLD_MCOUNT is only enabled if frame pointers are enabled.

This leads to non-functional dynamic ftrace (ftrace triggers a
WARN_ON()) when CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA is enabled and CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
is not.

Move the override out of that ifdef and into the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
ifdef where it belongs.
