KVM: arm/arm64: Cleanup the arch timer code's irqchip checking

Currently we check if we have an in-kernel irqchip and if the vgic was
properly implemented several places in the arch timer code.  But, we
already predicate our enablement of the arm timers on having a valid
and initialized gic, so we can simply check if the timers are enabled or
not.

This also gets rid of the ugly "error that's not an error but used to
signal that the timer shouldn't poke the gic" construct we have.
