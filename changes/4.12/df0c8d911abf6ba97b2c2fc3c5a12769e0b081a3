net: phy: Call bus->reset() after releasing PHYs from reset

The API convention makes it that a given MDIO bus reset should be able
to access PHY devices in its reset() callback and perform additional
MDIO accesses in order to bring the bus and PHYs in a working state.

Commit 69226896ad63 ("mdio_bus: Issue GPIO RESET to PHYs.") broke that
contract by first calling bus->reset() and then release all PHYs from
reset using their shared GPIO line, so restore the expected
functionality here.
