HID: logitech-hidpp: rework hidpp_connect_event()

Looks like all users don't care about a disconnect.
Simplify the various variant_connect() and put the connect state check
at the beginning.

For delayed input devices, make sure we go through all other connect
values (protocol, battery) before bailing out.
