md/r5cache: generate R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH

In r5c_finish_stripe_write_out(), R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH is append to
log->current_io.

Appending R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH in quiesce needs extra writes to
journal. To simplify the logic, we just skip R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH in
quiesce.

Even R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH supports multiple stripes per payload.
However, current implementation is one stripe per R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH,
which is simpler.
