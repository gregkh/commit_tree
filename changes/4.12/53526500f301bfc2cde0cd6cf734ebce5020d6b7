IB/hfi1: Permanently enable P_Key checking in HFI

Ingress and egress port P_Key checking should always be performed for
HFIs. This patch will enable ingress and egress P_Key checking when
the port is initialized and will ignore the P_Key information sent by
the FM in the port info structure which is meant to be used only by the
switch.
