power: supply: sbs-battery: fix the sbs interrupt request

Since we use the default primary handler for the irq, IRQF_ONESHOT must
be set. Otherwise the request fails and the following errors are
displayed:

genirq: Threaded irq requested with handler=NULL and !ONESHOT for irq 129
sbs-battery 0-000b: Failed to request irq: -22
