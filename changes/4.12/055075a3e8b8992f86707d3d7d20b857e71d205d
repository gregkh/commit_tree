[media] vivid: fix g_edid implementation

The VIDIOC_G_EDID implementation in vivid didn't take edid->start_block into account when
copying the EDID data.

Make sure that the internal EDID is updated with the correct CEC physical address. Currently
the returned EDID is updated, but that will only work well if edid->start_block is 0.
