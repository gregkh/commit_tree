drm/atomic: Acquire connection_mutex lock in drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes, v4.

mode_valid() called from drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes()
may need to look at connector->state because what a valid mode is may
depend on connector properties being set. For example some HDMI modes
might be rejected when a connector property forces the connector
into DVI mode.

Some implementations of detect() already lock all state,
so we have to pass an acquire_ctx to them to prevent a deadlock.

This means changing the function signature of detect() slightly,
and passing the acquire_ctx for locking multiple crtc's.
For the callbacks, it will always be non-zero. To allow callers
not to worry about this, drm_helper_probe_detect_ctx is added
which might handle -EDEADLK for you.

Changes since v1:
- Always set ctx parameter.
Changes since v2:
- Always take connection_mutex when probing.
Changes since v3:
- Remove the ctx from intel_dp_long_pulse, and add
  WARN_ON(!connection_mutex) (danvet)
- Update docs to clarify the locking situation. (danvet)
