tools/include: Sync kernel ABI headers with tooling headers

Sync (copy) the following v4.12 kernel headers to the tooling headers:

  arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h:
  arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h:
  arch/powerpc/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h:
  arch/s390/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h:
  arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h:
  arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h:

   - 'struct kvm_sync_regs' got changed in an ABI-incompatible way,
     fortunately none of the (in-kernel) tooling relied on it

   - new KVM_DEV calls added

  arch/x86/include/asm/required-features.h:

   - 5-level paging hardware ABI detail added

  arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h:

   - new CPU feature added

  arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h:

   - new VMX exit conditions

None of the changes requires fixes in the tooling source code.

This addresses the following warnings:

  Warning: include/uapi/linux/stat.h differs from kernel
  Warning: arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h differs from kernel
  Warning: arch/x86/include/asm/required-features.h differs from kernel

  Warning: arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h differs from kernel
  Warning: arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h differs from kernel
