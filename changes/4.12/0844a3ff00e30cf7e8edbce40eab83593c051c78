scsi: hisi_sas: add v2 hw internal abort timeout workaround

This patch is a workaround for a SoC bug where an internal abort command
may timeout. In v2 hw, the channel should become idle in order to finish
abort process. If the target side has been sending HOLD, host side
channel failed to complete the frame to send, and can not enter the idle
state. Then internal abort command will timeout.

As this issue is only in v2 hw, we deal with it in the hw layer.  Our
workaround solution is: If abort is not finished within a certain period
of time, we will check HOLD status. If HOLD has been sending, we will
send break command.
