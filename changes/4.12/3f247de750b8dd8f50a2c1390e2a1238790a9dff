Fix driver usage of 128B WQEs when WQ_CREATE is V1.

There are two versions of a structure for queue creation and setup that the
driver shares with FW. The driver was only treating as version 0.

Verify WQ_CREATE with 128B WQEs in V0 and V1.

Code review of another bug showed the driver passing
128B WQEs and 8 pages in WQ CREATE and V0.
Code inspection/instrumentation showed that the driver
uses V0 in WQ_CREATE and if the caller passes queue->entry_size
128B, the driver sets the hdr_version to V1 so all is good.
When I tested the V1 WQ_CREATE, the mailbox failed causing
the driver to unload.
