usb: usbip tool: Fix get_nports()

The commit 0775a9cbc694e8c72 ("usbip: vhci extension: modifications
to vhci driver") introduced multiple controllers, and nports as a sys
file, and claimed to read the nports from it, but it didn't.

In addition, the get_nports() has been so wrong that even with 8 port
lines for instance, it gets 7 (I am guessing it is due to a '\n' mess).
Nevertheless, we fix it by reading the nports attribute.
