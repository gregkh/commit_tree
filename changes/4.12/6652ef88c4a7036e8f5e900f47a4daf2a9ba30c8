mtd: nand: denali: remove meaningless writes to read-only registers

The write accesses to LOGICAL_PAGE_{DATA,SPARE}_SIZE have no effect
because the Denali User's Guide says these registers are read-only.

The hardware automatically multiplies the main/spare size by the
number of devices and update LOGICAL_PAGE_{DATA,SPARE}_SIZE.
