ALSA: firewire-lib: add support for source packet header field in CIP header

In IEC 61883-1, CIP headers can have a SPH field. When a packet has 1 in
SPH field of its CIP header, the packet has a source packet headers. A
source packet header consists of 32 bit field (= 1 quadlet) and it
transfers time stamp, which is the same value as the lower 25 bits of the
IEEE 1394 CYCLE_TIMER register and the rest is zero.

This commit just supports source packet header field because IEC 61883-1
includes ambiguity the position of this header and its count. Each
protocol layer is allowed to have actual implementation according its
requirements.
