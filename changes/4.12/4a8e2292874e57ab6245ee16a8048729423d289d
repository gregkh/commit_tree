drm/doc: atomic overview, with graph

I want to split up a few more things and document some details better
(like how exactly to subclass drm_atomic_state). And maybe also split
up the helpers a bit per-topic, but this should be a ok-ish start for
better atomic overview.

v2: Spelling and clarifications (Eric).

v3: Implement suggestion from Gabriel to fix the graph.

v4: Review from Laurent.
