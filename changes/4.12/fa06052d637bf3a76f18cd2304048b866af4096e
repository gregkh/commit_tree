mtd: Convert to dynamically allocated bdi infrastructure

MTD already allocates backing_dev_info dynamically. Convert it to use
generic infrastructure for this including proper refcounting. We drop
mtd->backing_dev_info as its only use was to pass mtd_bdi pointer from
one file into another and if we wanted to keep that in a clean way, we'd
have to make mtd hold and drop bdi reference as needed which seems
pointless for passing one global pointer...
