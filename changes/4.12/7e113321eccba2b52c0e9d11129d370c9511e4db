dt-bindings: net: sms911x: Add missing optional VDD regulators

The lan911x family of devices require supplying from 3.3 V power
supplies (connected to VDD_IO, VDD_A and VREG_3.3 pins).  The existing
driver however obtains only VDD_IO and VDD_A regulators in an optional
way so document this in bindings.
