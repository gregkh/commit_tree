IB/hfi1: Virtual Network Interface Controller (VNIC) HW support

HFI1 HW specific support for VNIC functionality.
Dynamically allocate a set of contexts for VNIC when the first vnic
port is instantiated. Allocate VNIC contexts from user contexts pool
and return them back to the same pool while freeing up. Set aside
enough MSI-X interrupts for VNIC contexts and assign them when the
contexts are allocated. On the receive side, use an RSM rule to
spread TCP/UDP streams among VNIC contexts.
