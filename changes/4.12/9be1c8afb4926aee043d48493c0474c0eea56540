clk: sunxi-ng: add Allwinner H5 CCU support for H3 CCU driver

Allwinner H5 is a SoC that features a design which keeps the peripheral
compatible with H3, so that it have also a CCU like the one on H3 --
only one bus gate/reset is added, and the mmc sample/output phases are
removed because of MMC controller update.

Add its support in our existing H3 CCU driver.
