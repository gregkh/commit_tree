srcu: Move combining-tree definitions for SRCU's benefit

This commit moves the C preprocessor code that defines the default shape
of the rcu_node combining tree to a new include/linux/rcu_node_tree.h
file as a first step towards enabling SRCU to create its own combining
tree, which in turn enables SRCU to implement per-CPU callback handling,
thus avoiding contention on the lock currently guarding the single list
of callbacks.  Note that users of SRCU still need to know the size of
the srcu_struct structure, hence include/linux rather than kernel/rcu.

This commit is code-movement only.
