compiler, clang: suppress warning for unused static inline functions

GCC explicitly does not warn for unused static inline functions for
-Wunused-function.  The manual states:

	Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or
	a non-inline static function is unused.

Clang does warn for static inline functions that are unused.

It turns out that suppressing the warnings avoids potentially complex
#ifdef directives, which also reduces LOC.

Suppress the warning for clang.
