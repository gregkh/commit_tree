ptrace: Properly initialize ptracer_cred on fork

When I introduced ptracer_cred I failed to consider the weirdness of
fork where the task_struct copies the old value by default.  This
winds up leaving ptracer_cred set even when a process forks and
the child process does not wind up being ptraced.

Because ptracer_cred is not set on non-ptraced processes whose
parents were ptraced this has broken the ability of the enlightenment
window manager to start setuid children.

Fix this by properly initializing ptracer_cred in ptrace_init_task

This must be done with a little bit of care to preserve the current value
of ptracer_cred when ptrace carries through fork.  Re-reading the
ptracer_cred from the ptracing process at this point is inconsistent
with how PT_PTRACE_CAP has been maintained all of these years.
