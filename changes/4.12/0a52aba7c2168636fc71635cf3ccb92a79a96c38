gfs2: Switch to rhashtable_lookup_get_insert_fast

Switch from rhashtable_lookup_insert_fast + rhashtable_lookup_fast to
rhashtable_lookup_get_insert_fast, which is cleaner and avoids an extra
rhashtable lookup.

At the same time, turn the retry loop in gfs2_glock_get into an infinite
loop.  The lookup or insert will eventually succeed, usually very fast,
but there is no reason to give up trying at a fixed number of
iterations.
