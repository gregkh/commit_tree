iio: adc: add support for X-Powers AXP20X and AXP22X PMICs ADCs

The X-Powers AXP20X and AXP22X PMICs have multiple ADCs. They expose the
battery voltage, battery charge and discharge currents, AC-in and VBUS
voltages and currents, 2 GPIOs muxable in ADC mode and PMIC temperature.

This adds support for most of AXP20X and AXP22X ADCs.
