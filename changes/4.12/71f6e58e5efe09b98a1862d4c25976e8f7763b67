powerpc/kprobes: Convert __kprobes to NOKPROBE_SYMBOL()

Along similar lines as commit 9326638cbee2 ("kprobes, x86: Use NOKPROBE_SYMBOL()
instead of __kprobes annotation"), convert __kprobes annotation to either
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() or nokprobe_inline. The latter forces inlining, in which case
the caller needs to be added to NOKPROBE_SYMBOL().

Also:
 - blacklist arch_deref_entry_point(), and
 - convert a few regular inlines to nokprobe_inline in lib/sstep.c

A key benefit is the ability to detect such symbols as being
blacklisted. Before this patch:

  $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist | grep read_mem
  $ perf probe read_mem
  Failed to write event: Invalid argument
    Error: Failed to add events.
  $ dmesg | tail -1
  [ 3736.112815] Could not insert probe at _text+10014968: -22

After patch:
  $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist | grep read_mem
  0xc000000000072b50-0xc000000000072d20	read_mem
  $ perf probe read_mem
  read_mem is blacklisted function, skip it.
  Added new events:
    (null):(null)        (on read_mem)
    probe:read_mem       (on read_mem)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

	  perf record -e probe:read_mem -aR sleep 1

  $ grep " read_mem" /proc/kallsyms
  c000000000072b50 t read_mem
  c0000000005f3b40 t read_mem
  $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/list
  c0000000005f3b48  k  read_mem+0x8    [DISABLED]
