drm/atomic: Add connector atomic_check function, v2.

The atomic_check function is useful for implementing properties, but
it can be used for other connector modeset related checks as well.

Similar to plane check functions, on a modeset atomic_check() is always
called.

Changes since v1:
- Make sure atomic_check() is called on any modeset.
