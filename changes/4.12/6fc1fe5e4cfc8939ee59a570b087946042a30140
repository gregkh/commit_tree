Revert "ceph: SetPageError() for writeback pages if writepages fails"

This reverts commit b109eec6f4332bd517e2f41e207037c4b9065094.

If I'm filling up a filesystem with this sort of command:

    $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/cephfs/fillfile bs=2M oflag=sync

...then I'll eventually get back EIO on a write. Further calls
will give us ENOSPC.

I'm not sure what prompted this change, but I don't think it's what we
want to do. If writepages failed, we will have already set the mapping
error appropriately, and that's what gets reported by fsync() or
close().

__filemap_fdatawait_range however, does this:

	wait_on_page_writeback(page);
	if (TestClearPageError(page))
		ret = -EIO;

...and that -EIO ends up trumping the mapping's error if one exists.

When writepages fails, we only want to set the error in the mapping,
and not flag the individual pages.
