scsi: pmcraid: fix endianess sparse annotations

The use of le32_to_cpu() etc in this driver looks completely arbitrary.
It may have made sense at some point, but it is not applied consistently,
so this driver presumably won't work on big-endian kernel builds.

Unfortunately it's unclear whether the type names or the calls to
le32_to_cpu() are the correct ones. I'm taking educated guesses here
and assume that most of the __le32 and __le16 annotations are correct,
adding the conversion helpers whereever we access those fields.

The exceptions are the 'fw_version' field that is always accessed as
big-endian, so I'm changing the type here, and the 'hrrq' values that
are accessed as little-endian, so I'm changing those the other way.

None of these changes should have any effect on little-endian
architectures like x86, but it addresses the sparse warnings.
