udp: make *udp*_queue_rcv_skb() functions static

Since the udp memory accounting refactor, we don't need any more
to export the *udp*_queue_rcv_skb(). Make them static and fix
a couple of sparse warnings:

net/ipv4/udp.c:1615:5: warning: symbol 'udp_queue_rcv_skb' was not
declared. Should it be static?
net/ipv6/udp.c:572:5: warning: symbol 'udpv6_queue_rcv_skb' was not
declared. Should it be static?

Fixes: 850cbaddb52d ("udp: use it's own memory accounting schema")
Fixes: c915fe13cbaa ("udplite: fix NULL pointer dereference")
