net/mlx5: Properly check applicability of devlink eswitch commands

Currently we don't check that the link type is Eth and hence crash
on IB ports when attempting to deref esw->xxx, fix that.

To avoid repeating this check over and over, put the existing
checks and the one on link type in a single helper.
