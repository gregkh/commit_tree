net: ena: fix theoretical Rx hang on low memory systems

For the rare case where the device runs out of free rx buffer
descriptors (in case of pressure on kernel  memory),
and the napi handler continuously fail to refill new Rx descriptors
until device rx queue totally runs out of all free rx buffers
to post incoming packet, leading to a deadlock:
* The device won't send interrupts since all the new
Rx packets will be dropped.
* The napi handler won't try to allocate new Rx descriptors
since allocation is part of NAPI that's not being invoked any more

The fix involves detecting this scenario and rescheduling NAPI
(to refill buffers) by the keepalive/watchdog task.
