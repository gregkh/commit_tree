power: supply: bq24190_charger: Use extcon to determine ilimit, 5v boost

Add support for monitoring an extcon device with USB SDP/CDP/DCP and HOST
cables and adjust ilimit and enable/disable the 5V boost converter
accordingly. This is necessary on systems where the PSEL pin is hardwired
high and ILIM needs to be set by software based on the detected charger
type, as well as on systems where the 5V boost converter is used, as
that always needs to be enabled from software.
