net/mlx5e: Introduce switch channels

A fail safe helper functions that allows switching to new channels on the
fly,  In simple words:

make_new_config(new_params)
{
    new_channels = open_channels(new_params);
    if (!new_channels)
         return "Failed, but current channels are still active :)"

    switch_channels(new_channels);

    return "SUCCESS";
}

Demonstrate mlx5e_switch_priv_channels usage in set channels ethtool
callback and make it fail-safe using the new switch channels mechanism.
