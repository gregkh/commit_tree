drm/vmwgfx: Explicityly track screen target width and height

We can no longer make the assumption that vmw_stdu_update_st() will
be called when there's a valid display surface attached.  So
instead of using display_srf for width and height, make a record of
these paremeters when the screen target is first defined.
