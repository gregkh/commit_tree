arm: dma-mapping: Don't override dma_ops in arch_setup_dma_ops()

The arch_setup_dma_ops() function is in charge of setting dma_ops with a
call to set_dma_ops(). set_dma_ops() is also called from

- highbank and mvebu bus notifiers
- dmabounce (to be replaced with swiotlb)
- arm_iommu_attach_device

(arm_iommu_attach_device is itself called from IOMMU and bus master
device drivers)

To allow the arch_setup_dma_ops() call to be moved from device add time
to device probe time we must ensure that dma_ops already setup by any of
the above callers will not be overriden.

Aftering replacing dmabounce with swiotlb, converting IOMMU drivers to
of_xlate and taking care of highbank and mvebu, the workaround should be
removed.
