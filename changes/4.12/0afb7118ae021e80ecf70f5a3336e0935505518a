tpm: add sleep only for retry in i2c_nuvoton_write_status()

Currently, there is an unnecessary 1 msec delay added in
i2c_nuvoton_write_status() for the successful case. This
function is called multiple times during send() and recv(),
which implies adding multiple extra delays for every TPM
operation.

This patch calls usleep_range() only if retry is to be done.
