phy: exynos4: Remove duplicated defines of PHY register defines

Phy drivers access PMU region through regmap provided by exynos-pmu
driver.   However there is no need to duplicate defines for PMU
registers.  Instead just use whatever is defined in exynos-regs-pmu.h.

Additionally MIPI PHY registers for Exynos5433 start from the same
address as Exynos4 and Exynos5250 so re-use existing defines.

This reduces number of defines and allows removal of one header file.
