ASoC: core: remove pointless auxiliary from snd_soc_component

commit 1a653aa44725 ("ASoC: core: replace aux_comp_list to ...")
tried to replace aux_comp_list to component_dev_list,
but it failed because of binding timing. Thus, Sylwester fixuped it by
commit d2e3a1358c37 ("ASoC: Fix binding and probing of auxiliary...").

One of main purpose of commit 1a653aa44725 ("ASoC: core: replace...")
was remove replaceable list (= list_aux) from snd_soc_component by using
new "auxiliary" flags (but it failed).
Because of this background, current code has reborned card_aux_list
(= same as original list_aux), and almost pointless "auxiliary" flags.

Let's remove pointless "auxiliary" flags by this patch
This means, it is same as revert both
commit 1a653aa44725 ("ASoC: core: replace aux_comp_list to ...") and
commit d2e3a1358c37 ("ASoC: Fix binding and probing of auxiliary...").
