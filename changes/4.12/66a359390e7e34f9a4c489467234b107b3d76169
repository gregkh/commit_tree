USB: core: add helpers to retrieve endpoints

Many USB drivers iterate over the available endpoints to find required
endpoints of a specific type and direction. Typically the endpoints are
required for proper function and a missing endpoint should abort probe.

To facilitate code reuse, add a helper to retrieve common endpoints
(bulk or interrupt, in or out) and four wrappers to find a single
endpoint.

Note that the helpers are marked as __must_check to serve as a reminder
to always verify that all expected endpoints are indeed present. This
also means that any optional endpoints, typically need to be looked up
through separate calls.
