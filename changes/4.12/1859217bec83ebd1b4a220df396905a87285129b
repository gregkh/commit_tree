soc: tegra: make fuse-tegra explicitly non-modular

The Makefiles currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/soc/tegra/Makefile:obj-y += fuse/
drivers/soc/tegra/fuse/Makefile:obj-y += fuse-tegra.o

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.
