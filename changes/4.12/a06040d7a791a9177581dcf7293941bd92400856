arm64: uaccess: ensure extension of access_ok() addr

Our access_ok() simply hands its arguments over to __range_ok(), which
implicitly assummes that the addr parameter is 64 bits wide. This isn't
necessarily true for compat code, which might pass down a 32-bit address
parameter.

In these cases, we don't have a guarantee that the address has been zero
extended to 64 bits, and the upper bits of the register may contain
unknown values, potentially resulting in a suprious failure.

Avoid this by explicitly casting the addr parameter to an unsigned long
(as is done on other architectures), ensuring that the parameter is
widened appropriately.
