ibmvnic: Update main crq initialization and release

Update the initialization and release routines for the crq queue so that
we validate the crq queue.

Additionally this updates the naming of the init and release routines
for the crq queue to drop the ibmvnic prefix. This matches the naming
for similar routines in the driver
