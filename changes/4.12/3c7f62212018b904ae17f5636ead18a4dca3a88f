sparc64: fix fault handling in NGbzero.S and GENbzero.S

When any of the functions contained in NGbzero.S and GENbzero.S
vector through *bzero_from_clear_user, we may end up taking a
fault when executing one of the store alternate address space
instructions. If this happens, the exception handler does not
restore the %asi register.

This commit fixes the issue by introducing a new exception
handler that ensures the %asi register is restored when
a fault is handled.
