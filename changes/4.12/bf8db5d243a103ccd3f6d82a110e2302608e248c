bpf: lru: Refactor LRU map tests in map_perf_test

One more LRU test will be added later in this patch series.
In this patch, we first move all existing LRU map tests into
a single syscall (connect) first so that the future new
LRU test can be added without hunting another syscall.

One of the map name is also changed from percpu_lru_hash_map
to nocommon_lru_hash_map to avoid the confusion with percpu_hash_map.
