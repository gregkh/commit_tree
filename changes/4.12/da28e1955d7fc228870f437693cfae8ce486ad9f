ACPICA: Disassembler: Enhance resource descriptor detection

ACPICA commit ba5020b2dbe1538e4ccd7ac2dfd8843a690c007f

This change enhances the detection of resource descriptors
within a buffer object. For the end_tag opcode, the second byte
is defined to be either a checksum or zero. All known ASL compilers
insert a zero for this byte. The disassembler now ensures this
byte is zero before deciding that a buffer should be disassembled
to a resource descriptor. This helps eliminate incorrect decisions
when attempting to disassemble a buffer to a resource descriptor.
