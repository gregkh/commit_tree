kvm/svm: Setup MCG_CAP on AMD properly

MCG_CAP[63:9] bits are reserved on AMD. However, on an AMD guest, this
MSR returns 0x100010a. More specifically, bit 24 is set, which is simply
wrong. That bit is MCG_SER_P and is present only on Intel. Thus, clean
up the reserved bits in order not to confuse guests.
