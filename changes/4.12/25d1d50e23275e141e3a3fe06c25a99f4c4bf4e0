scsi: virtio_scsi: Always try to read VPD pages

Passed through SCSI targets may have transfer limits which come from the
host SCSI controller or something on the host side other than the target
itself.

To make this work properly, the hypervisor can adjust the target's VPD
information to advertise these limits.  But for that to work, the guest
has to look at the VPD pages, which we won't do by default if it is an
SPC-2 device, even if it does actually support it.

This adds a workaround to address this, forcing devices attached to a
virtio-scsi controller to always check the VPD pages.  This is modelled
on a similar workaround for the storvsc (Hyper-V) SCSI controller,
although that exists for slightly different reasons.

A specific case which causes this is a volume from IBM's IPR RAID
controller (which presents as an SPC-2 device, although it does support
VPD) passed through with qemu's 'scsi-block' device.
