md/raid5: use bio_inc_remaining() instead of repurposing bi_phys_segments as a counter

md/raid5 needs to keep track of how many stripe_heads are processing a
bio so that it can delay calling bio_endio() until all stripe_heads
have completed.  It currently uses 16 bits of ->bi_phys_segments for
this purpose.

16 bits is only enough for 256M requests, and it is possible for a
single bio to be larger than this, which causes problems.  Also, the
bio struct contains a larger counter, __bi_remaining, which has a
purpose very similar to the purpose of our counter.  So stop using
->bi_phys_segments, and instead use __bi_remaining.

This means we don't need to initialize the counter, as our caller
initializes it to '1'.  It also means we can call bio_endio() directly
as it tests this counter internally.
