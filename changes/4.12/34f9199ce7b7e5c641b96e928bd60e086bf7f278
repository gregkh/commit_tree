qed: Fix overriding of supported autoneg value.

Driver currently uses advertised-autoneg value to populate the
supported-autoneg field. When advertised field is updated, user gets
the same value for supported field. Supported-autoneg value need to be
populated from the link capabilities value returned by the MFW.
