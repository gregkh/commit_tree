cxl: Remove unused values in bare-metal environment.

The two previously fields pid and tid, located in the structure
cxl_irq_info, are only used in the guest environment. To avoid confusion,
it's not necessary to fill the fields in the bare-metal environment.
Pid_tid is now renamed to 'reserved' to avoid undefined behavior on
bare-metal. The PSL Process and Thread Identification Register
(CXL_PSL_PID_TID_An) is only used when attaching a dedicated process
for PSL8 only. This register goes away in CAIA2.
