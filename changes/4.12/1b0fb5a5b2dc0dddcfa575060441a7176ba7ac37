dm bufio: avoid a possible ABBA deadlock

__get_memory_limit() tests if dm_bufio_cache_size changed and calls
__cache_size_refresh() if it did.  It takes dm_bufio_clients_lock while
it already holds the client lock.  However, lock ordering is violated
because in cleanup_old_buffers() dm_bufio_clients_lock is taken before
the client lock.

This results in a possible deadlock and lockdep engine warning.

Fix this deadlock by changing mutex_lock() to mutex_trylock().  If the
lock can't be taken, it will be re-checked next time when a new buffer
is allocated.

Also add "unlikely" to the if condition, so that the optimizer assumes
that the condition is false.
