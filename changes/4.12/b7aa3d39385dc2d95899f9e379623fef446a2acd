nbd: add a reconfigure netlink command

We want to be able to reconnect dead connections to existing block
devices, so add a reconfigure netlink command.  We will also allow users
to change their timeout on the fly, but everything else will require a
disconnect and reconnect.  You won't be able to add more connections
either, simply replace dead connections with new more lively
connections.
