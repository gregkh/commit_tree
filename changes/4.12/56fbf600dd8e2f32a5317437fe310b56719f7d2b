iommu/arm-smmu: Add global SMR masking property

The current SMR masking support using a 2-cell iommu-specifier is
primarily intended to handle individual masters with large and/or
complex Stream ID assignments; it quickly gets a bit clunky in other SMR
use-cases where we just want to consistently mask out the same part of
every Stream ID (e.g. for MMU-500 configurations where the appended TBU
number gets in the way unnecessarily). Let's add a new property to allow
a single global mask value to better fit the latter situation.
