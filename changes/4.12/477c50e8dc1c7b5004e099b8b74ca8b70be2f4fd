drivers/perf: arm_pmu_acpi: avoid perf IRQ init when guest PMU is off

We saw perf IRQ init failures when running Linux kernel in an ACPI
guest without PMU (i.e. pmu=off). This is because perf IRQ is not
present when pmu=off, but arm_pmu_acpi still tries to register
or unregister GSI. This patch addresses the problem by checking
gicc->performance_interrupt. If it is 0, which is the value set
by qemu when pmu=off, we skip the IRQ register/unregister process.
