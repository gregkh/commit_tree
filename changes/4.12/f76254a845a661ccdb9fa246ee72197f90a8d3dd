samples/bpf: fix XDP_FLAGS_SKB_MODE detach for xdp_tx_iptunnel

The xdp_tx_iptunnel program can be terminated in two ways, after
N-seconds or via Ctrl-C SIGINT.  The SIGINT code path does not
handle detatching the correct XDP program, in-case the program
was attached with XDP_FLAGS_SKB_MODE.

Fix this by storing the XDP flags as a global variable, which is
available for the SIGINT handler function.
