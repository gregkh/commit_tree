scsi: qedf: Cleanup the type of io_log->op

We store sc_cmd->cmnd[0] which is an unsigned char in io_log->op so
this should also be unsigned char.  The other thing is that this is
displayed in the debugfs:

	seq_printf(s, "0x%02x:", io_log->op);

Smatch complains that the formatting won't work for negative values so
changing it to unsigned silences that warning as well.
