bpf: lru: Add map-in-map LRU example

This patch adds a map-in-map LRU example.
If we know only a subset of cores will use the
LRU, we can allocate a common LRU list per targeting core
and store it into an array-of-hashs.

It allows using the common LRU map with map-update performance
comparable to the BPF_F_NO_COMMON_LRU map but without wasting memory
on the unused cores that we know they will never access the LRU map.

BPF_F_NO_COMMON_LRU:
> map_perf_test 32 8 10000000 10000000 | awk '{sum += $3}END{print sum}'
9234314 (9.23M/s)

map-in-map LRU:
> map_perf_test 512 8 1260000 80000000 | awk '{sum += $3}END{print sum}'
9962743 (9.96M/s)

Notes that the max_entries for the map-in-map LRU test is 1260000 which
is the max_entries for each inner LRU map.  8 processes have been
started, so 8 * 1260000 = 10080000 (~10M) which is close to what is
used in the BPF_F_NO_COMMON_LRU test.
