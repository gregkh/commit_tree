scsi: cxlflash: Remove port configuration assumptions

At present, the cxlflash driver only supports hardware with two FC ports. The
code was initially designed with this assumption and is dependent on having
two FC ports - adding more ports will break logic within the driver.

To mitigate this issue, remove the existing port assumptions and transition
the code to support more than two ports. As a side effect, clarify the
interpretation of the DK_CXLFLASH_ALL_PORTS_ACTIVE flag.
