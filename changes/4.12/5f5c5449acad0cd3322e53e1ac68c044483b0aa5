sh_eth: Use platform device for printing before register_netdev()

The MDIO initialization failure message is printed using the network
device, before it has been registered, leading to:

     (null): failed to initialise MDIO

Use the platform device instead to fix this:

    sh-eth ee700000.ethernet: failed to initialise MDIO
