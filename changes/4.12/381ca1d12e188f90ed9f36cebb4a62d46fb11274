ASoC: blackfin: constify snd_soc_ops structures

Declare snd_soc_ops structures as const as they are only stored
in the ops field of a snd_soc_dai_link structure. This field is
of type const, so snd_soc_ops structures having this property
can be made const too.

Cross compiled the .o files for blackfin architecture.
