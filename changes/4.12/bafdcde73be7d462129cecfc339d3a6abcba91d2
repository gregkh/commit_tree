PM / runtime: Document autosuspend-helper side effects

Document the fact that the autosuspend delay and enable helpers may
change the power.usage_count and resume or suspend a device depending on
the values of power.autosuspend_delay and power.use_autosuspend.

Note that this means that a driver must disable autosuspend before
disabling runtime pm on probe errors and on driver unbind if the device
is to be suspended upon return (as a negative delay may otherwise keep
the device resumed).
