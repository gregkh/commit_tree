firmware: dmi_scan: Look for SMBIOS 3 entry point first

Since version 3.0.0 of the SMBIOS specification, there can be
multiple entry points in memory, pointing to one or two DMI tables.
If both a 32-bit ("_SM_") entry point and a 64-bit ("_SM3_") entry
point are present, the specification requires that the latter points
to a table which is a super-set of the table pointed to by the
former. Therefore we should give preference to the 64-bit ("_SM3_")
entry point.

However, currently the code is picking the first valid entry point
it finds. Per specification, we should look for a 64-bit ("_SM3_")
entry point first, and if we can't find any, look for a 32-bit
("_SM_" or "_DMI_") entry point. Modify the code to do that.
