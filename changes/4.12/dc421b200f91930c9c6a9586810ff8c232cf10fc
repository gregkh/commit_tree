powerpc/hotplug-mem: Fix missing endian conversion of aa_index

When adding or removing memory, the aa_index (affinity value) for the
memblock must also be converted to match the endianness of the rest
of the 'ibm,dynamic-memory' property.  Otherwise, subsequent retrieval
of the attribute will likely lead to non-existent nodes, followed by
using the default node in the code inappropriately.
