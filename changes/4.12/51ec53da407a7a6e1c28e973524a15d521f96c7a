drm/i915: Make intel_get_pipe_from_connector atomic

Drive-by fixup while looking at all the connector_list walkers -
holding connection_mutex does actually _not_ give you locking to look
at the legacy drm_connector->encoder->crtc pointer chain. That one is
solely owned by the atomic commit workers. Instead we must inspect the
atomic state.
