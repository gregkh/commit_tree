powerpc/xive: Fix missing check of rc != OPAL_BUSY

Dan Carpenter noticed that the code in __xive_native_disable_queue() has a for
loop with an unconditional break in the middle, which doesn't make a lot of
sense.

What the code's supposed to do is loop as long as OPAL says it's busy, if we get
any other return code, either success or failure, then we should break the loop.

So add the missing check.
