KVM: MIPS: Fix maybe-uninitialized build failure

This commit fixes a "maybe-uninitialized" build failure in
arch/mips/kvm/tlb.c when KVM, DYNAMIC_DEBUG and JUMP_LABEL are all
enabled. The failure is:

arch/mips/kvm/tlb.c: In function ‘kvm_mips_host_tlb_inv’:
./include/linux/dynamic_debug.h:126:3: error: ‘idx_kernel’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
   __dynamic_pr_debug(&descriptor, pr_fmt(fmt), \
   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
arch/mips/kvm/tlb.c:169:16: note: ‘idx_kernel’ was declared here
  int idx_user, idx_kernel;
                ^~~~~~~~~~

There is a similar error relating to "idx_user". Both errors were
observed with GCC 6.

As far as I can tell, it is impossible for either idx_user or idx_kernel
to be uninitialized when they are later read in the calls to kvm_debug,
but to satisfy the compiler, add zero initializers to both variables.
