xfs: remove use of do_div with 32-bit dividend in quota

The kbuild test robot caught this; in debug code we have another
caller of do_div with a 32-bit dividend (j) which is caught now
that we are using the kernel-supplied do_div.

None of the values used here are 64-bit; just use simple division.
