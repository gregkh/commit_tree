dm cache policy smq: make the cleaner policy write-back more aggressively

By ignoring the sentinels the cleaner policy is able to write-back dirty
cache data much faster.  There is no reason to respect the sentinels,
which denote that a block was changed recently, when using the cleaner
policy given that the cleaner is tasked with writing back all dirty
data.
