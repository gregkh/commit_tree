nvme: let dm-mpath distinguish nvme error codes

Currently most IOs which return the nvme error codes are retried on
the other path if those IOs returns EIO from NVMe driver. This
patch let Multipath distinguish nvme media error codes and some
generic or cmd-specific nvme error codes so that multipath will
not retry those kinds of IO, to save bandwidth.
