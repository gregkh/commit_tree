mm: fix check for reclaimable pages in PF_MEMALLOC reclaim throttling

PF_MEMALLOC direct reclaimers get throttled on a node when the sum of
all free pages in each zone fall below half the min watermark.  During
the summation, we want to exclude zones that don't have reclaimables.
Checking the same pgdat over and over again doesn't make sense.
