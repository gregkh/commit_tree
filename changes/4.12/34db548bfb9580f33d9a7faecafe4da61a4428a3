mlx4: add page recycling in receive path

Same technique than some Intel drivers, for arches where PAGE_SIZE = 4096

In most cases, pages are reused because they were consumed
before we could loop around the RX ring.

This brings back performance, and is even better,
a single TCP flow reaches 30Gbit on my hosts.

v2: added full memset() in mlx4_en_free_frag(), as Tariq found it was needed
if we switch to large MTU, as priv->log_rx_info can dynamically be changed.
