selftests/powerpc: Test TM and VMX register state

Test that the VMX checkpointed register state is maintained when a VMX
unavailable exception is taken during a transaction.

Thanks to Breno Leitao <brenohl@br.ibm.com> and
Gustavo Bueno Romero <gromero@br.ibm.com> for the original test this
is based heavily on.
