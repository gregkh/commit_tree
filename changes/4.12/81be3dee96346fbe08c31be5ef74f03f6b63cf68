fs/xattr.c: zero out memory copied to userspace in getxattr

getxattr uses vmalloc to allocate memory if kzalloc fails.  This is
filled by vfs_getxattr and then copied to the userspace.  vmalloc,
however, doesn't zero out the memory so if the specific implementation
of the xattr handler is sloppy we can theoretically expose a kernel
memory.  There is no real sign this is really the case but let's make
sure this will not happen and use vzalloc instead.
