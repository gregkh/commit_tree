KVM: arm/arm64: Add ARM user space interrupt signaling ABI

We have 2 modes for dealing with interrupts in the ARM world. We can
either handle them all using hardware acceleration through the vgic or
we can emulate a gic in user space and only drive CPU IRQ pins from
there.

Unfortunately, when driving IRQs from user space, we never tell user
space about events from devices emulated inside the kernel, which may
result in interrupt line state changes, so we lose out on for example
timer and PMU events if we run with user space gic emulation.

Define an ABI to publish such device output levels to userspace.
