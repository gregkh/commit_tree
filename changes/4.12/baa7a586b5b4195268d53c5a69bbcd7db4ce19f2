staging: media/platform/bcm2835: remove gstreamer workaround

Gstreamer's v4l2src reacted poorly to certain outputs from the bcm2835
video driver's ioctl ops function vidioc_enum_framesizes, so a
workaround was created that could be activated by user input. This
workaround would replace the driver's ioctl ops struct with another,
similar struct--only with no function pointed to by
vidioc_enum_framesizes. With no response, gstreamer would attempt to
continue with some default settings that happened to work better.

However, this bug has been fixed in gstreamer since 2014, so we
shouldn't include this workaround in the stable version of the driver.
