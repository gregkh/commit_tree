drivers/perf: arm_pmu: define armpmu_init_fn

We expect an ARM PMU's init function to have a particular prototype,
which we open-code in a few places. This is less than ideal, considering
that we cast a void value to this type in one location, and a mismatch
could easily be missed.

Add a typedef so that we can ensure this is consistent.
