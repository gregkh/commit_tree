infiniband: hns: avoid gcc-7.0.1 warning for uninitialized data

hns_roce_v1_cq_set_ci() calls roce_set_bit() on an uninitialized field,
which will then change only a few of its bits, causing a warning with
the latest gcc:

infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_hw_v1.c: In function 'hns_roce_v1_cq_set_ci':
infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_hw_v1.c:1854:23: error: 'doorbell[1]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]
  roce_set_bit(doorbell[1], ROCEE_DB_OTHERS_H_ROCEE_DB_OTH_HW_SYNS_S, 1);

The code is actually correct since we always set all bits of the
port_vlan field, but gcc correctly points out that the first
access does contain uninitialized data.

This initializes the field to zero first before setting the
individual bits.
