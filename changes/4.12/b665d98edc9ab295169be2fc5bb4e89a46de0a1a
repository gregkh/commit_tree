net/mlx5: Tolerate irq_set_affinity_hint() failures

Add tolerance to failures of irq_set_affinity_hint().
Its role is to give hints that optimizes performance,
and should not block the driver load.

In non-SMP systems, functionality is not available as
there is a single core, and all these calls definitely
fail.  Hence, do not call the function and avoid the
warning prints.
