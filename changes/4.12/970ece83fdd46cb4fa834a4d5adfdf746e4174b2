drm/atomic: Move enable/connector check up in check_modeset()

Now that handle_conflicting_encoders no longer touches active state,
so there's no need to do the check quite that late any more.

Doing it with all the other checks makes it a lot more clear what the
below block tries to accomplish, and this feels like a better place to
put the check.
