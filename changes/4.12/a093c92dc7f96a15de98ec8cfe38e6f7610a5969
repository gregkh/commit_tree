powerpc/debug: Add missing warn flag to WARN_ON's non-builtin path

When trapped on WARN_ON(), report_bug() is expected to return
BUG_TRAP_TYPE_WARN so the caller will increment NIP by 4 and continue.
The __builtin_constant_p() path of the PPC's WARN_ON()
calls (indirectly) __WARN_FLAGS() which has BUGFLAG_WARNING set,
however the other branch does not which makes report_bug() report a
bug rather than a warning.

Fixes: f26dee15103f ("debug: Avoid setting BUGFLAG_WARNING twice")
