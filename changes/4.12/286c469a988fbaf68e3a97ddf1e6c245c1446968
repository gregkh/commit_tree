mm: hwpoison: call shake_page() after try_to_unmap() for mlocked page

Memory error handler calls try_to_unmap() for error pages in various
states.  If the error page is a mlocked page, error handling could fail
with "still referenced by 1 users" message.  This is because the page is
linked to and stays in lru cache after the following call chain.

  try_to_unmap_one
    page_remove_rmap
      clear_page_mlock
        putback_lru_page
          lru_cache_add

memory_failure() calls shake_page() to hanlde the similar issue, but
current code doesn't cover because shake_page() is called only before
try_to_unmap().  So this patches adds shake_page().
