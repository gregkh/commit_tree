Revert "mtip32xx: pass BLK_MQ_F_NO_SCHED"

This reverts commit 4981d04dd8f1ab19e2cce008da556d7f099b6e68.

The driver has been converted to using the proper infrastructure
for issuing internal commands. This means it's now safe to use with
the scheduling infrastruture, so we can now revert the change
that turned off scheduling for mtip32xx.
