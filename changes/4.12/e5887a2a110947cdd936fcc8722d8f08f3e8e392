net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: rework in-chip bridging

All ports -- internal and external, for chips featuring a PVT -- have a
mask restricting to which internal ports a frame is allowed to egress.

Now that DSA exposes the number of ports and their bridge devices, it is
possible to extract the code generating the VLAN map and make it generic
so that it can be shared later with the cross-chip bridging code.
