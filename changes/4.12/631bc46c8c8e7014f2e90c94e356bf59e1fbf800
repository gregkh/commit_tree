powerpc/64s: Data driven machine check evaluation

Have machine types define i-side and d-side tables to describe their
machine check encodings, and match entries to evaluate (for reporting)
machine checks.

Functionality is mostly unchanged (tested with a userspace harness), but
it does make a change in that it no longer records DAR as the effective
address for those errors where it is specified to be invalid (which is a
reporting change only).
