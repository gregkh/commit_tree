net: sched: make default fifo qdiscs appear in the dump

The original reason [1] for having hidden qdiscs (potential scalability
issues in qdisc_match_from_root() with single linked list in case of large
amount of qdiscs) has been invalidated by 59cc1f61f0 ("net: sched: convert
qdisc linked list to hashtable").

This allows us for bringing more clarity and determinism into the dump by
making default pfifo qdiscs visible.

We're not turning this on by default though, at it was deemed [2] too
intrusive / unnecessary change of default behavior towards userspace.
Instead, TCA_DUMP_INVISIBLE netlink attribute is introduced, which allows
applications to request complete qdisc hierarchy dump, including the
ones that have always been implicit/invisible.

Singleton noop_qdisc stays invisible, as teaching the whole infrastructure
about singletons would require quite some surgery with very little gain
(seeing no qdisc or seeing noop qdisc in the dump is probably setting
the same user expectation).
