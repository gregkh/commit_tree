USB: core: add helpers to retrieve endpoints in reverse order

Several drivers have implemented their endpoint look-up loops in such a
way that they have picked the last endpoint descriptor of the specified
type should more than one such descriptor exist.

To avoid any regressions, add corresponding helpers to lookup endpoints
by searching the endpoint descriptors in reverse order.
