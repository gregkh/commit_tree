i2c: export i2c_client_type structure

i2c bus has 2 different types of device belonging to the same bus and
bus notifiers use device type to distinguish between adapters and clients.
Previously we only had i2c_adapter_type exported, which made code wanting
to work with i2c_client devices test for type not equal to adapter type.
This unfortunately is not safe if we ever add another type to the bus,
so let's export i2c_client_type as well.
