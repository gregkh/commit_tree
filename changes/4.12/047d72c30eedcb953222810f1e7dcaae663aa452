mm: remove seemingly spurious reclaimability check from laptop_mode gating

Commit 1d82de618ddd ("mm, vmscan: make kswapd reclaim in terms of
nodes") allowed laptop_mode=1 to start writing not just when the
priority drops to DEF_PRIORITY - 2 but also when the node is
unreclaimable.

That appears to be a spurious change in this patch as I doubt the series
was tested with laptop_mode, and neither is that particular change
mentioned in the changelog.  Remove it, it's still recent.
