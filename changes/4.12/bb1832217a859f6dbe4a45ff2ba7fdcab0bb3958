powerpc/mm/hash: Store addr_limit in PACA

We optmize the slice page size array copy to paca by copying only the
range based on addr_limit. This will require us to not look at page size
array beyond addr_limit in PACA on slb fault. To enable that copy task
size to paca which will be used during slb fault.
