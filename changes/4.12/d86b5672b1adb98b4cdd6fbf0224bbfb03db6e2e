xen-netfront: avoid crashing on resume after a failure in talk_to_netback()

Unavoidable crashes in netfront_resume() and netback_changed() after a
previous fail in talk_to_netback() (e.g. when we fail to read MAC from
xenstore) were discovered. The failure path in talk_to_netback() does
unregister/free for netdev but we don't reset drvdata and we try accessing
it after resume.

Fix the bug by removing the whole xen device completely with
device_unregister(), this guarantees we won't have any calls into netfront
after a failure.
