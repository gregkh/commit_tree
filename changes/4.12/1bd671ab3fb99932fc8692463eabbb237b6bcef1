IB/opa-vnic: VNIC Ethernet Management Agent (VEMA) function

management information packets with the Ethernet Manager (EM).
It interfaces with the OPA VNIC netdev function to SET/GET the management
information. The information exchanged with the EM includes class port
details, encapsulation configuration, various counters, unicast and
multicast MAC list and the MAC table. It also supports sending traps
