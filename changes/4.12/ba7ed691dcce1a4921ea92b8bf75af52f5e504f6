[media] v4l2-compat-ioctl32: VIDIOC_S_EDID should return all fields on error

Most ioctls do not have to write back the contents of the argument
if an error is returned. But VIDIOC_S_EDID is an exception together
with the EXT_CTRLS ioctls (already handled correctly).

Add this exception to v4l2-compat-ioctl32.

This fixes a compliance error when using compat32 and trying to
set a new EDID with more blocks than the hardware supports. In
that case the driver will return -E2BIG and set edid.blocks to the
actual maximum number of blocks. This field was never copied back
to userspace due to this bug.
