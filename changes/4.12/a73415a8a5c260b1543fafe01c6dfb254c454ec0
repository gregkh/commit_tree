reiserfs: Remove useless setting of i_flags

reiserfs_new_inode() clears IMMUTABLE and APPEND flags from a symlink
i_flags however a few lines below in sd_attrs_to_i_attrs() we will
happily overwrite i_flags with whatever we inherited from the directory.
Since this behavior is there for ages just remove the useless setting of
i_flags.
