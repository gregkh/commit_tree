gpio: mvebu: fix gpio bank registration when pwm is used

If more than one gpio bank has the "pwm" property, only one will be
registered successfully, all the others will fail with:
mvebu-gpio: probe of f1018140.gpio failed with error -17

That's because in alloc_pwms(), the chip->base (aka "int pwm"), was not
set (thus, ==0) ; and 0 is a meaningful start value in alloc_pwm().
What was intended is mvpwm->chip->base = -1.
Like that, the numbering will be done auto-magically

Moreover, as the region might be already occupied by another pwm, we
shouldn't force:
mvpwm->chip->base = 0
nor
mvpwm->chip->base = id * MVEBU_MAX_GPIO_PER_BANK;

Tested on clearfog-pro (Marvell 88F6828)
