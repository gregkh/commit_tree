drm/i915: Keep a global seqno per-engine

Replace the global device seqno with one for each engine, and account
for in-flight seqno on each separately. This is consistent with
dma-fence as each timeline has separate fence-contexts for each engine
and a seqno is only ordered within a fence-context (i.e.  seqno do not
need to be ordered wrt to other engines, just ordered within a single
engine). This is required to enable request rewinding for preemption on
individual engines (we have to rewind the global seqno to avoid
overflow, and we do not have to rewind all engines just to preempt one.)

v2: Rename active_seqno to inflight_seqnos to more clearly indicate that
it is a counter and not equivalent to the existing seqno. Update
functions that operated on active_seqno similarly.
