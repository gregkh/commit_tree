netfilter: nf_tables: validate the expr explicitly after init successfully

When we want to validate the expr's dependency or hooks, we must do two
things to accomplish it. First, write a X_validate callback function
and point ->validate to it. Second, call X_validate in init routine.
This is very common, such as fib, nat, reject expr and so on ...

It is a little ugly, since we will call X_validate in the expr's init
routine, it's better to do it in nf_tables_newexpr. So we can avoid to
do this again and again. After doing this, the second step listed above
is not useful anymore, remove them now.

Patch was tested by nftables/tests/py/nft-test.py and
nftables/tests/shell/run-tests.sh.
