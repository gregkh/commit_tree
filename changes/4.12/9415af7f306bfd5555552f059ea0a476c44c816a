iwlwifi: mvm: support new binding API

For a000 devices the binding API needs to include relevant
lmac ID - support the new API.
The new API should be used regardless if the device had CDB or
not. If there is no actual CDB support the binding is bound
to first lmac regardless of the band.
There are some functionality changes in binding restrictions
and quota allocations that will be handled in future patches.
