ipv4: fib: Move FIB notification code to a separate file

Most of the code concerned with the FIB notification chain currently
resides in fib_trie.c, but this isn't really appropriate, as the FIB
notification chain is also used for FIB rules.

Therefore, it makes sense to move the common FIB notification code to a
separate file and have it export the relevant functions, which can be
invoked by its different users (e.g., fib_trie.c, fib_rules.c).
