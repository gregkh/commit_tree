KVM: x86: check against irqchip_mode in kvm_set_routing_entry()

Let's replace the checks for pic_in_kernel() and ioapic_in_kernel() by
checks against irqchip_mode.

Also make sure that creation of any route is only possible if we have
an lapic in kernel (irqchip_in_kernel()) or if we are currently
inititalizing the irqchip.

This is necessary to switch pic_in_kernel() and ioapic_in_kernel() to
irqchip_mode, too.
