[media] pci: mantis: constify mb86a16_config structure

Declare mb86a16_config structure as const as it is either passed as
an argument to the function dvb_attach or is dereferenced. dvb_attach
calls its first argument on the rest of its arguments. The first argument
of dvb_attach in the changed case is mb86a16_attach and the parameter of
this function to which the object reference is passed is of type
const. So, mb86a16_config structures having this property can be made
const.
