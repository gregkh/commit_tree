usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: fix pm_runtime functions calling

This patch fixes an issue that this driver is possible to access
the registers before pm_runtime_get_sync() if a gadget driver is
installed first. After that, oops happens on R-Car Gen3 environment.
To avoid it, this patch changes the pm_runtime call timing from
probe/remove to udc_start/udc_stop.
