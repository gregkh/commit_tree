ARM64: PCI: Fix struct acpi_pci_root_ops allocation failure path

Commit 093d24a20442 ("arm64: PCI: Manage controller-specific data on
per-controller basis") added code to allocate ACPI PCI root_ops
dynamically on a per host bridge basis but failed to update the
corresponding memory allocation failure path in pci_acpi_scan_root()
leading to a potential memory leakage.

Fix it by adding the required kfree call.
