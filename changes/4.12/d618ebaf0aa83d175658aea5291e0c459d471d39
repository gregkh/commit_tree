f2fs: enable small discard by default

This patch start to enable 4K granularity small discard by default
when realtime discard is on, so, in seriously fragmented space,
small size discard can be issued in time to avoid useless storage
space occupying of invalid filesystem's data, then performance of
flash storage can be recovered.
