mm/mmap: replace SHM_HUGE_MASK with MAP_HUGE_MASK inside mmap_pgoff

Commit 091d0d55b286 ("shm: fix null pointer deref when userspace
specifies invalid hugepage size") had replaced MAP_HUGE_MASK with
SHM_HUGE_MASK.  Though both of them contain the same numeric value of
0x3f, MAP_HUGE_MASK flag sounds more appropriate than the other one in
the context.  Hence change it back.
