drivers/perf: arm_pmu: handle no platform_device

In armpmu_dispatch_irq() we look at arm_pmu::plat_device to acquire
platdata, so that we can defer to platform-specific IRQ handling,
required on some 32-bit parts. With the advent of ACPI we won't always
have a platform_device, and so we must avoid trying to dereference
fields from it.

This patch fixes up armpmu_dispatch_irq() to avoid doing so, introducing
a new armpmu_get_platdata() helper.
