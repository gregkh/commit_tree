staging: wilc1000: Remove useless cast.

Variable ip_addr is already declared as pointer to u8. Again explicit type
casting of ip_addr to u8, is not required. Hence this patch removes it
by using the following coccinelle script.

@@
type T;
T *ptr,p;

(
- (T *)(&p)
+ &p
|
- (T *)ptr

- (T *)(ptr)
+ ptr

- (T)(p)
+ p
)
