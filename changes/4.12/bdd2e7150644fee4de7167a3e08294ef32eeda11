cxl: Update implementation service layer

The service layer API (in cxl.h) lists some low-level functions whose
implementation is different on PSL8, PSL9 and XSL:
- Init implementation for the adapter and the afu.
- Invalidate TLB/SLB.
- Attach process for dedicated/directed models.
- Handle psl interrupts.
- Debug registers for the adapter and the afu.
- Traces.
Each environment implements its own functions, and the common code uses
them through function pointers, defined in cxl_service_layer_ops.
