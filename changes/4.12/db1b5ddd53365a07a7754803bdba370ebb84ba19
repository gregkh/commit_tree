IB/core: Rename uverbs event file structure

Previously, ib_uverbs_event_file was suffixed by _file as it contained
the actual file information. Since it's now only used as base struct
for ib_uverbs_async_event_file and ib_uverbs_completion_event_file,
we change its name to ib_uverbs_event_queue. This represents its
logical role better.
