powerpc/tm: Fix FP and VMX register corruption

In commit dc3106690b20 ("powerpc: tm: Always use fp_state and vr_state
to store live registers"), a section of code was removed that copied
the current state to checkpointed state. That code should not have been
removed.

When an FP (Floating Point) unavailable is taken inside a transaction,
we need to abort the transaction. This is because at the time of the
tbegin, the FP state is bogus so the state stored in the checkpointed
registers is incorrect. To fix this, we treclaim (to get the
checkpointed GPRs) and then copy the thread_struct FP live state into
the checkpointed state. We then trecheckpoint so that the FP state is
correctly restored into the CPU.

The copying of the FP registers from live to checkpointed is what was
missing.

This simplifies the logic slightly from the original patch.
tm_reclaim_thread() will now always write the checkpointed FP
state. Either the checkpointed FP state will be written as part of
the actual treclaim (in tm.S), or it'll be a copy of the live
state. Which one we use is based on MSR[FP] from userspace.

Similarly for VMX.
