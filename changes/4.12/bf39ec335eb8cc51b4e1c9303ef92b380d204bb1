drm/i915/gvt: adjust mem size for low resolution type

From commit d1a513be1f0a ("drm/i915/gvt: add resolution definition for vGPU
type"), small type has been restricted to small resolution, so not
require larger high GM size any more. Change to smaller 384M for more
VM creation with vGPU enabled which still perform reasonable workload.
