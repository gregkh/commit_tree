scsi: scsi_error: count medium access timeout only once per EH run

The current medium access timeout counter will be increased for
each command, so if there are enough failed commands we'll hit
the medium access timeout for even a single device failure and
the following kernel message is displayed:

sd H:C:T:L: [sdXY] Medium access timeout failure. Offlining disk!

Fix this by making the timeout per EH run, ie the counter will
only be increased once per device and EH run.

Fixes: 18a4d0a ("[SCSI] Handle disk devices which can not process medium access commands")
