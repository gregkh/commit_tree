HID: sony: Make work handling more generic

The driver currently uses sony_schedule_work to submit output
reports for the different devices for LEDs or rumble.

This patch adds a new parameter to sony_schedule_work to allow
scheduling for other types of work. The next patch in this series
will utilize this functionality. Considering the driver structure
and all error handling it felt best to reuse sony_schedule_work
and sony_cancel_work. The idea was inspired by the wacom driver
which does something similar.
