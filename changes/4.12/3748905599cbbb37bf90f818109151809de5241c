ibmvnic: Correct crq and resource releasing

We should not be releasing the crq's when calling close for the
adapter, these need to remain open to facilitate operations such
as updating the mac address. The crq's should be released in the
adpaters remove routine.

Additionally, we need to call release_reources from remove. This
corrects the scenario of trying to remove an adapter that has only
been probed.
