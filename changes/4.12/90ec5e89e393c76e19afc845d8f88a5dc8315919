kretprobes: Ensure probe location is at function entry

kretprobes can be registered by specifying an absolute address or by
specifying offset to a symbol. However, we need to ensure this falls at
function entry so as to be able to determine the return address.

Validate the same during kretprobe registration. By default, there
should not be any offset from a function entry, as determined through a
kallsyms_lookup(). Introduce arch_function_offset_within_entry() as a
way for architectures to override this.
