arm64: sysreg: sort by encoding

Out sysreg definitions are largely (but not entirely) in ascending order
of op0:op1:CRn:CRm:op2.

It would be preferable to enforce this sort, as this makes it easier to
verify the set of encodings against documentation, and provides an
obvious location for each addition in future, minimising conflicts.

This patch enforces this order, by moving the few items that break it.
There should be no functional change.
