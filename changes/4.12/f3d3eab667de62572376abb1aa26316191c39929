HID: i2c: Call acpi_device_fix_up_power for ACPI-enumerated devices

For ACPI devices which do not have a _PSC method, the ACPI subsys cannot
query their initial state at boot, so these devices are assumed to have
been put in D0 by the BIOS, but for touchscreens that is not always true.

This commit adds a call to acpi_device_fix_up_power to explicitly put
devices without a _PSC method into D0 state (for devices with a _PSC
method it is a nop). Note we only need to do this on probe, after a
resume the ACPI subsys knows the device is in D3 and will properly
put it in D0.

This fixes the SIS0817 i2c-hid touchscreen on a Peaq C1010 2-in-1
device failing to probe with a "hid_descr_cmd failed" error.
