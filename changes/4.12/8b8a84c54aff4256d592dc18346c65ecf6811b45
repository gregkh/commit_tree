mfd: omap-usb-tll: Fix inverted bit use for USB TLL mode

Commit 16fa3dc75c22 ("mfd: omap-usb-tll: HOST TLL platform driver")
added support for USB TLL, but uses OMAP_TLL_CHANNEL_CONF_ULPINOBITSTUFF
bit the wrong way. The comments in the code are correct, but the inverted
use of OMAP_TLL_CHANNEL_CONF_ULPINOBITSTUFF causes the register to be
enabled instead of disabled unlike what the comments say.

Without this change the Wrigley 3G LTE modem on droid 4 EHCI bus can
be only pinged few times before it stops responding.
