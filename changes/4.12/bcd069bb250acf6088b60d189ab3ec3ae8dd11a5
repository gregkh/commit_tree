scsi: sd: Remove LBPRZ dependency for discards

Separating discards and zeroout operations allows us to remove the LBPRZ
block zeroing constraints from discards and honor the device preferences
for UNMAP commands.

If supported by the device, we'll also choose UNMAP over one of the
WRITE SAME variants for discards.
