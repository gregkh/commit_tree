tpm_tis_spi: Use single function to transfer data

The algorithm for sending data to the TPM is mostly identical to the
algorithm for receiving data from the TPM, so a single function is
sufficient to handle both cases.

This is a prequisite for all the other fixes, so we don't have to fix
everything twice (send/receive)

v2: u16 instead of u8 for the length.
