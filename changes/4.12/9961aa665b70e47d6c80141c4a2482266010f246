tools build: Fix feature detection redefinion of build flags

This change is a follow up of https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/2/16

The patch above avoided redefining CC, CXX and PKG_CONFIG in feature
detection. The patch was not merged due to a unsolved concern with the
-MD flag.

Later, commit c8c188679ccf ("tools build: Use the same CC for feature
detection and actual build") did the change for CC and CXX but not
PKG_CONFIG.

This patch makes PKG_CONFIG consistent with CC and CXX and moves the -MD
to CFLAGS, as suggested by Jiri in the thread above.
