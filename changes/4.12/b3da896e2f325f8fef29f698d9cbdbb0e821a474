clk: cs2000: select 12.20 High Accuracy on LFRatioCfg

cs2000 can select Static/Dynamic ratio based Frequency Synthesizer
Mode, it can select 20.12 High Multiplier interpret for 32-bit
User Defined Ratio if Dynamic ratio mode. Otherwise it should select
12.20 High Accuracy mode.
Current cs2000 is supporting Static ratio mode only, so it should
select 12.20 High Accuracy mode, not 20.12 High Multiplier mode.
This patch fixes it.
