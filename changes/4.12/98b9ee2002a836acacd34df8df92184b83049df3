IB/hfi1: Cache neighbor secure data after link up

Secure data is transferred across the link during verify
cap. This includes Neighbor Guid, Type, and Port Number.
This transfer is not guaranteed to complete until the 8051
firmware has completed processing of the state_complete
frame. Move the consumption of this data from verify cap
handling to link up handling to ensure the data is finalized.

Additionally, do not notify the SM that the link is up until
after this data is actually available.
