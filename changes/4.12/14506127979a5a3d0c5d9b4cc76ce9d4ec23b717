btrfs: fix a bogus warning when converting only data or metadata

If your filesystem has, eg, data:raid0 metadata:raid1, and you run "btrfs
balance -dconvert=raid1", the meta.target field will be uninitialized.
That's otherwise ok, as it's unused except for this warning.

Thus, let's use the existing set of raid levels for the comparison.

As a side effect, non-convert balances will now nag about data>metadata.
