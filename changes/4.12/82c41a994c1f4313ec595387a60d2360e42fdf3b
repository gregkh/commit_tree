staging: vchi: Remove ARM64 from TODO list

ARM64 for core vchiq which is the core of vc04_services should
now be work complete.  The driver compiles without any errors
or warnings, and works just as well as 32 bit mode.  The
necessary compatibility wrappers for the 32 bit ioctls have been
written and merged.

Since no more ARM64 specific changes should be needed, perhaps
it's best to remove it from the TODO list.
