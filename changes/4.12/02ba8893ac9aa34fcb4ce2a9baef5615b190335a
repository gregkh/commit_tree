block: fix leak of q->rq_wb

CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE found a possible leak of q->rq_wb when a
request queue is reregistered. This has been a problem since wbt was
introduced, but the WARN_ON(!list_empty(&stats->callbacks)) in the
blk-stat rework exposed it. Fix it by cleaning up wbt when we unregister
the queue.
