Revert "pinctrl: generic: Add bi-directional and output-enable"

This reverts commit 8c58f1a7a4b6d1d723bf25fef9d842d5a11200d0.

It turns out that applying these generic properties was
premature: the properties used in the driver using this
are of unclear electrical nature and the subject need to
be discussed.
