btrfs: Prevent scrub recheck from racing with dev replace

scrub_setup_recheck_block() calls btrfs_map_sblock() and then accesses
bbio without protection of bio_counter.

This can lead to use-after-free if racing with dev replace cancel.

Fix it by increasing bio_counter before calling btrfs_map_sblock() and
decreasing the bio_counter when corresponding recover is finished.
