PCI: Add pci_mmap_resource_range() and use it for ARM64

Starting to leave behind the legacy of the pci_mmap_page_range() interface
which takes "user-visible" BAR addresses.  This takes just the resource and
offset.

For now, both APIs coexist and depending on the platform, one is
implemented as a wrapper around the other.
