samples/bpf: add -Wno-unknown-warning-option to clang

I was initially going to remove '-Wno-address-of-packed-member' because I
thought it was not supposed to be there but Daniel suggested using
'-Wno-unknown-warning-option'.

This silences several warnings similiar to the one below

warning: unknown warning option '-Wno-address-of-packed-member' [-Wunknown-warning-option]
1 warning generated.
