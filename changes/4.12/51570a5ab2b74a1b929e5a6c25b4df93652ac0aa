A Sample of using socket cookie and uid for traffic monitoring

Add a sample program to demostrate the possible usage of
get_socket_cookie and get_socket_uid helper function. The program will
store bytes and packets counting of in/out traffic monitored by iptables
and store the stats in a bpf map in per socket base. The owner uid of
the socket will be stored as part of the data entry. A shell script for
running the program is also included.
