scsi: cxlflash: Add hardware queues attribute

As staging for supporting multiple hardware queues, add an attribute to show
and set the current number of hardware queues for the host. Support specifying
a hard limit or a CPU affinitized value. This will allow the number of
hardware queues to be tuned by a system administrator.
