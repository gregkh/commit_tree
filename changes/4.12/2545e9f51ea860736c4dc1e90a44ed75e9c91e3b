x86/intel_rdt: Cleanup namespace to support multiple resource types

Lot of data structures and functions are named after cache specific
resources(named after cbm, cache etc). In many cases other non cache
resources may need to share the same data structures/functions.

Generalize such naming to prepare to add more resources like memory
bandwidth.
