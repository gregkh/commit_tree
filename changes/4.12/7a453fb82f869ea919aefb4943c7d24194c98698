drm/i915: Remove redudant wait for each engine to idle from seqno wrap

Having added the wait upon each engine to idle into the central
i915_gem_wait_for_idle(), we can remove the now redundant wait from
reset_all_global_seqno(). This has the advantage of removing the late
detection of an error (an engine still busy) which left the seqno reset
only partially complete (though it should be safe enough!).
