md-cluster: introduce cluster_check_sync_size

Support resize is a little complex for clustered
raid, since we need to ensure all the nodes share
the same knowledge about the size of raid.

We achieve the goal by check the sync_size which
is in each node's bitmap, we can only change the
capacity after cluster_check_sync_size returns 0.

Also, get_bitmap_from_slot is added to get a slot's
bitmap. And we exported some funcs since they are
used in cluster_check_sync_size().

We can also reuse get_bitmap_from_slot to remove
redundant code existed in bitmap_copy_from_slot.
