tcm_fileio: Prevent information leak for short reads

If we failed to read data from backing file (probably because some one
truncate file under us), we must zerofill cmd's data, otherwise it will
be returned as is. Most likely cmd's data are unitialized pages from
page cache. This result in information leak.

(Change BUG_ON into -EINVAL se_cmd failure - nab)
