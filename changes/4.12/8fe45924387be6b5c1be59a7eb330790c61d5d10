bpf: map_get_next_key to return first key on NULL

When iterating through a map, we need to find a key that does not exist
in the map so map_get_next_key will give us the first key of the map.
This often requires a lot of guessing in production systems.

This patch makes map_get_next_key return the first key when the key
pointer in the parameter is NULL.
