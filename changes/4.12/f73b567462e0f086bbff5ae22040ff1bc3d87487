drm/i915: Include GT/seqno activity in engine/hangcheck debugfs

Whilst investigating some mysterious failures with hangcheck not running
during gem_busy/basic-hang-default, the question is why did we decide to
cancel the retire_work (which queues the hangcheck)? That decision is
based around GT activity, so include that information in the debug
report.

v2: Include the GT awake status in the error state
