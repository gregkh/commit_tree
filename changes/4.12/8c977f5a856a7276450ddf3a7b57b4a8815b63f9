mdio: mux: fix device_node_continue.cocci warnings

Device node iterators put the previous value of the index variable, so an
explicit put causes a double put.

In particular, of_mdiobus_register can fail before doing anything
interesting, so one could view it as a no-op from the reference count
point of view.
