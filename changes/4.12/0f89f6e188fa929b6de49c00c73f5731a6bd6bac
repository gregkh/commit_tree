crypto: crct10dif-vpmsum - Fix missing preempt_disable()

In crct10dif_vpmsum() we call enable_kernel_altivec() without first
disabling preemption, which is not allowed.

It used to be sufficient just to call pagefault_disable(), because that
also disabled preemption. But the two were decoupled in commit 8222dbe21e79
("sched/preempt, mm/fault: Decouple preemption from the page fault
logic") in mid 2015.

The crct10dif-vpmsum code inherited this bug from the crc32c-vpmsum code
on which it was modelled.

So add the missing preempt_disable/enable(). We should also call
disable_kernel_fp(), although it does nothing by default, there is a
debug switch to make it active and all enables should be paired with
disables.
