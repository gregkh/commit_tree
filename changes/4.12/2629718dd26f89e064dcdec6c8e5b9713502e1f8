fsnotify: Remove useless list deletion and comment

After removing all the indirection it is clear that

hlist_del_init_rcu(&mark->obj_list);

in fsnotify_destroy_marks() is not needed as the mark gets removed from
the list shortly afterwards in fsnotify_destroy_mark() ->
fsnotify_detach_mark() -> fsnotify_detach_from_object(). Also there is
no problem with mark being visible on object list while we call
fsnotify_destroy_mark() as parallel destruction of marks from several
places is properly handled (as mentioned in the comment in
fsnotify_destroy_marks(). So just remove the list removal and also the
stale comment.
