CIFS: Add asynchronous context to support kernel AIO

Currently the code doesn't recognize asynchronous calls passed
by io_submit() and processes all calls synchronously. This is not
what kernel AIO expects. This patch introduces a new async context
that keeps track of all issued i/o requests and moves a response
collecting procedure to a separate thread. This allows to return
to a caller immediately for async calls and call iocb->ki_complete()
once all requests are completed. For sync calls the current thread
simply waits until all requests are completed.
