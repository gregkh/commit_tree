lkdtm: add bad USER_DS test

This adds CORRUPT_USER_DS to check that the get_fs() test on syscall
return (via __VERIFY_PRE_USERMODE_STATE) still sees USER_DS. Since
trying to deal with values other than USER_DS and KERNEL_DS across all
architectures in a safe way is not sensible, this sets KERNEL_DS, but
since that could be extremely dangerous if the protection is not present,
it also raises SIGKILL for current, so that no matter what, the process
will die. A successful test will be visible with a BUG(), like all the
other LKDTM tests.
