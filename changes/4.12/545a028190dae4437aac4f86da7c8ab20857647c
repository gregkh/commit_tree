kprobes: Document how optimized kprobes are removed from module unload

Thomas discovered a bug where the kprobe trace tests had a race
condition where the kprobe_optimizer called from a delayed work queue
that does the optimizing and "unoptimizing" of a kprobe, can try to
modify the text after it has been freed by the init code.

The kprobe trace selftest is a special case, and Thomas and myself
investigated to see if there's a chance that this could also be a bug
with module unloading, as the code is not obvious to how it handles
this. After adding lots of printks, I figured it out. Thomas suggested
that this should be commented so that others will not have to go
through this exercise again.
