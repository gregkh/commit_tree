amd-xgbe: use PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER in xgbe_map_rx_buffer

xgbe_map_rx_buffer is rather confused about what PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER
means. It uses PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER-1 assuming that
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER is the first costly order which is not the case
actually because orders larger than that are costly. And even that
applies only to sleeping allocations which is not the case here. We
simply do not perform any costly operations like reclaim or compaction
for those. Simplify the code by dropping the order calculation and use
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER directly.
