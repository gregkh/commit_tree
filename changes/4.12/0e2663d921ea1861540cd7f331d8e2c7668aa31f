drivers/perf: arm_pmu: split cpu-local irq request/free

Currently we have functions to request/free all IRQs for a given PMU.
While this works today, this won't work for ACPI, where we don't know
the full set of IRQs up front, and need to request them separately.

To enable supporting ACPI, this patch splits out the cpu-local
request/free into new functions, allowing us to request/free individual
IRQs.

As this makes it possible/necessary to request a PPI once per cpu, an
additional check is added to detect mismatched PPIs. This shouldn't
matter for the DT / platform case, as we check this when parsing.
