braille-console: Fix value returned by _braille_console_setup

commit bbeddf52adc1 ("printk: move braille console support into
separate braille.[ch] files") introduced _braille_console_setup()
to outline the braille initialization code.  There was however some
confusion over the value it was supposed to return. commit 2cfe6c4ac7ee
("printk: Fix return of braille_register_console()") tried to fix it
but failed to.

This fixes and documents the returned value according to the use
in printk.c: non-zero return means a parsing error, and thus this
console configuration should be ignored.
