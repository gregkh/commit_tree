ASoC: Call snd_soc_set_dmi_name() unconditionally

Since recently UCM can pick up a configuration specific to the board
via card longname field, and we introduced a helper function
snd_soc_set_dmi_name() for that.  So far, it was used only in one
place (sound/soc/intel/boards/broadwell.c), but it should be more
widely applied.

This patch puts a big hammer for that: it lets snd_soc_register_card()
calling snd_soc_set_dmi_name() unconditionally, so that all x86
devices get the better longname string.  This would have no impact for
other systems without DMI support, as snd_soc_set_dmi_name() is no-op
on them.
