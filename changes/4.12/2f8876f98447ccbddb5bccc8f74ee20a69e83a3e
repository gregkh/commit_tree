s390/dump_stack: use control program identification string

If running within a level 3 hypervisor, the hypervisor provides a
SYSIB block which contains a control program indentifier string. Use
this string instead of the simple KVM and z/VM strings only. In case
of z/VM this provides addtional information: the z/VM version.

The new string looks similar to this:

Hardware name: IBM 2964 N96 702 (z/VM 6.4.0)
