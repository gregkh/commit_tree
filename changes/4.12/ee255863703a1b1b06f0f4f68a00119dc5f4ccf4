drm: shmobile: use vblank hooks in struct drm_crtc_funcs

The vblank hooks in struct drm_driver are deprecated and only meant for
legacy drivers.  For modern drivers with DRIVER_MODESET flag, the hooks
in struct drm_crtc_funcs should be used instead.

As the result, shmob_drm_crtc_enable_vblank() becomes a static function,
although it gets moved around a bit to save forward declaration.
