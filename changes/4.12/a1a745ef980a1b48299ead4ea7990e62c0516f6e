batman-adv: fix memory leak when dropping packet from other gateway

The skb must be released in the receive handler since b91a2543b4c1
("batman-adv: Consume skb in receive handlers"). Just returning NET_RX_DROP
will no longer automatically free the memory. This results in memory leaks
when unicast packets from other backbones must be dropped because they
share a common backbone.
