bpf: remove struct bpf_prog_type_list

There's no need to have struct bpf_prog_type_list since
it just contains a list_head, the type, and the ops
pointer. Since the types are densely packed and not
actually dynamically registered, it's much easier and
smaller to have an array of type->ops pointer. Also
initialize this array statically to remove code needed
to initialize it.

In order to save duplicating the list, move it to a new
header file and include it in the places needing it.
