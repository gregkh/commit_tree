mtd: nand: denali: consolidate INTR_STATUS__* and INTR_EN__* macros

The interrupts are enabled by INTR_EN register, then asserted
interrupts can be observed via INTR_STATUS register.

The bit fields are identical between INTR_EN and INTR_STATUS, so we
can merge the bit field macros.  Likewise for DATA_INTR.
