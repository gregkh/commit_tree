sched/fair: Explicitly generate __update_load_avg() instances

The __update_load_avg() function is an __always_inline because its
used with constant propagation to generate different variants of the
code without having to duplicate it (which would be prone to bugs).

Explicitly instantiate the 3 variants.

Note that most of this is called from rather hot paths, so reducing
branches is good.
