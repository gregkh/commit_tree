x86/mm: Fix dump pagetables for 4 levels of page tables

Commit fdd3d8ce0ea62 ("x86/dump_pagetables: Add support for 5-level
paging") introduced an error for dumping with only 4 levels by setting
PGD_LEVEL_MULT to a wrong value.

This is leading to e.g. addresses printed as "(null)" for ranges:

  x86/mm: Found insecure W+X mapping at address (null)/(null)

Make PGD_LEVEL_MULT a multiple of PTRS_PER_P4D instead of PTRS_PER_PUD
