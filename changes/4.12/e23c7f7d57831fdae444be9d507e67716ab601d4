soc: imx: add PM dependency for IMX7_PM_DOMAINS

The new pm domain driver causes a build failure when CONFIG_PM
is not set:

warning: (IMX7_PM_DOMAINS) selects PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS which has unmet direct dependencies (PM)
drivers/base/power/domain_governor.c: In function 'default_suspend_ok':
drivers/base/power/domain_governor.c:75:17: error: 'struct dev_pm_info' has no member named 'ignore_children'

This adds a dependency to ensure that we don't attempt to build the
driver without CONFIG_PM.
