xprtrdma: Support unplugging an HCA from under an NFS mount

The device driver for the underlying physical device associated
with an RPC-over-RDMA transport can be removed while RPC-over-RDMA
transports are still in use (ie, while NFS filesystems are still
mounted and active). The IB core performs a connection event upcall
to request that consumers free all RDMA resources associated with
a transport.

There may be pending RPCs when this occurs. Care must be taken to
release associated resources without leaving references that can
trigger a subsequent crash if a signal or soft timeout occurs. We
rely on the caller of the transport's ->close method to ensure that
the previous RPC task has invoked xprt_release but the transport
remains write-locked.

A DEVICE_REMOVE upcall forces a disconnect then sleeps. When ->close
is invoked, it destroys the transport's H/W resources, then wakes
the upcall, which completes and allows the core driver unload to
continue.
