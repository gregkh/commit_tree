staging: lustre: Fix sparse endianness warnings cast to restricted __le64 and __le32

The struct lu_dirpage elements in lustre_idl.h file are modified to
__le64 and __le32 types since the  elements are always converted from
litte endian to processor native format in mdc_request.c file.

Following warnings are removed by this fix.
