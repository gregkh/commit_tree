jbd2: preserve original nofs flag during journal restart

When a transaction starts, start_this_handle() saves current
PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS value so that it can be restored at journal stop time.
Journal restart is a special case that calls start_this_handle() without
stopping the transaction. start_this_handle() isn't aware that the
original value is already stored so it overwrites it with current value.

For instance, a call sequence like below leaves PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS flag set
at the end:

  jbd2_journal_start()
  jbd2__journal_restart()
  jbd2_journal_stop()

Make jbd2__journal_restart() restore the original value before calling
start_this_handle().
