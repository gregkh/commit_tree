netfilter: nf_queue: only call synchronize_net twice if nf_queue is active

nf_unregister_net_hook(s) can avoid a second call to synchronize_net,
provided there is no nfqueue active in that net namespace (which is
the common case).

This also gets rid of the extra arg to nf_queue_nf_hook_drop(), normally
this gets called during netns cleanup so no packets should be queued.

For the rare case of base chain being unregistered or module removal
while nfqueue is in use the extra hiccup due to the packet drops isn't
a big deal.
