MIPS: Remove confusing else statement in __do_page_fault()

Commit 41c594ab65fc ("[MIPS] MT: Improved multithreading support.")
added an else case to an if statement in do_page_fault() (which has
since gained 2 leading underscores) for some unclear reason. If the
condition in the if statement evaluates true then we execute a goto &
branch elsewhere anyway, so the else has no effect. Combined with an #if
0 block with misleading indentation introduced in the same commit it
makes the code less clear than it could be.

Remove the unnecessary else statement & de-indent the printk within
the #if 0 block in order to make the code easier for humans to parse.
