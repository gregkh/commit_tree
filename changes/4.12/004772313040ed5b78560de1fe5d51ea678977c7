KVM: VMX: remove bogus check for invalid EPT violation

handle_ept_violation is checking for "guest-linear-address invalid" +
"not a paging-structure walk".  However, _all_ EPT violations without
a valid guest linear address are paging structure walks, because those
EPT violations happen when loading the guest PDPTEs.

Therefore, the check can never be true, and even if it were, KVM doesn't
care about the guest linear address; it only uses the guest *physical*
address VMCS field.  So, remove the check altogether.
