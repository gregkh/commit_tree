ipv4: fib_rules: Add notifier info to FIB rules notifications

Whenever a FIB rule is added or removed, a notification is sent in the
FIB notification chain. However, listeners don't have a way to tell
which rule was added or removed.

This is problematic as we would like to give listeners the ability to
decide which action to execute based on the notified rule. Specifically,
offloading drivers should be able to determine if they support the
reflection of the notified FIB rule and flush their LPM tables in case
they don't.

Do that by adding a notifier info to these notifications and embed the
common FIB rule struct in it.
