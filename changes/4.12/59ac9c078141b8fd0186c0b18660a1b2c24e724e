target/fileio: Fix zero-length READ and WRITE handling

This patch fixes zero-length READ and WRITE handling in target/FILEIO,
which was broken a long time back by:

Since:

  commit d81cb44726f050d7cf1be4afd9cb45d153b52066
  Author: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>
  Date:   Mon Sep 17 16:36:11 2012 -0700

      target: go through normal processing for all zero-length commands

which moved zero-length READ and WRITE completion out of target-core,
to doing submission into backend driver code.

To address this, go ahead and invoke target_complete_cmd() for any
non negative return value in fd_do_rw().
