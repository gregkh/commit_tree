ns: allow ns_entries to have custom symlink content

Patch series "Expose task pid_ns_for_children to userspace".

pid_ns_for_children set by a task is known only to the task itself, and
it's impossible to identify it from outside.

It's a big problem for checkpoint/restore software like CRIU, because it
can't correctly handle tasks, that do setns(CLONE_NEWPID) in proccess of
their work.  If they have a custom pid_ns_for_children before dump, they
must have the same ns after restore.  Otherwise, restored task bumped
into enviroment it does not expect.

This patchset solves the problem.  It exposes pid_ns_for_children to ns
directory in standard way with the name "pid_for_children":

  ~# ls /proc/5531/ns -l | grep pid
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 14 16:38 pid -> pid:[4026531836]
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 14 16:38 pid_for_children -> pid:[4026532286]

This patch (of 2):

Make possible to have link content prefix yyy different from the link
name xxx:

  $ readlink /proc/[pid]/ns/xxx
  yyy:[4026531838]

This will be used in next patch.
