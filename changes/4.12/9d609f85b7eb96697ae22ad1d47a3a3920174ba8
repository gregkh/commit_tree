dm integrity: support larger block sizes

The DM integrity block size can now be 512, 1k, 2k or 4k.  Using larger
blocks reduces metadata handling overhead.  The block size can be
configured at table load time using the "block_size:<value>" option;
where <value> is expressed in bytes (defult is still 512 bytes).

It is safe to use larger block sizes with DM integrity, because the
DM integrity journal makes sure that the whole block is updated
atomically even if the underlying device doesn't support atomic writes
of that size (e.g. 4k block ontop of a 512b device).
