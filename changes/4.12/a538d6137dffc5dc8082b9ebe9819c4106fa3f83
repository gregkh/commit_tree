drm/dp: Kill total_pbn and total_slots in struct drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr

The total vcpi time slots is always 63 and does not depend on the link BW,
remove total_slots from MST topology manager struct. The next change is to
remove total_pbn which is hardcoded to 2560. The total PBN that the
topology manager allocates from depends on the link rate and is not a
constant. So, fix this by removing the total_pbn member itself.
