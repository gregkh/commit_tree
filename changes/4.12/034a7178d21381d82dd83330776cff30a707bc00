staging: ks7010: move WPA code to separate function

Checkpatch emits WARNING: Too many leading tabs - consider code
refactoring. Function contains 5 levels of nesting and 14 local
variables. Code can be simplified and nesting reduced by refactoring
into separate functions.

WPA code is contained and may be factored out into a separate
function. This will reduce the length and complexity of
hostif_data_indication(). At times within the WPA code errors result
in the function returning. In order to maintain this behaviour new
function should return a status integer.

Factor out WPA code into separate function. Add only code needed to
get compilation to pass, including modifying return statements. Make
no other code changes, program logic is unchanged.
