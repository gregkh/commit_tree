i40e: reduce wait time for adminq command completion

When sending an adminq command, we wait for the command to complete in
a loop. This loop waits for an entire millisecond, when in practice the
adminq command is processed often much faster.

Change the loop to use i40e_usec_delay instead, and wait for 50 usecs
each time instead. This appears to be about the minimum time required,
based on some manual observation and testing.

The primary benefit of this change is reducing latency of various
operations in the PF driver, especially when related to having a large
number of VFs enabled.

For example, on Linux, when instantiating 128 VFs, the time to finish
the operation dropped from about 9 seconds down to under 6 seconds.
Additionally, the time it takes to finish a PF reset with 128 VFs
dropped from 5.1 seconds down to 0.7 seconds.

As the examples above show, a significant portion of the delay is wasted
waiting for admiqn operations which have already finished.

This patch shouldn't cause impact to functionality, as we still check
and keep waiting until the command does get processed. The only expected
change is an increase in CPU utilization as we now check for completion
far more times. However, in practice the commands appear to generally be
complete within the first delay window anyways.
