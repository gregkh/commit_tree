RDMA/bnxt_re: HW workarounds for handling specific conditions

This patch implements the following HW workarounds

1. The SQ depth needs to be augmented  by 128 + 1 to avoid running
   into an Out of order CQE issue
2. Workaround to handle the problem where the HW fast path engine continues
   to access DMA memory in retranmission mode even after the WQE has
   already been completed. If the HW reports this condition, driver detects
   it and posts a Fence WQE. The driver stops reporting the completions
   to stack until it receives completion  for Fence WQE.
