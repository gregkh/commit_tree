powerpc/fadump: Reserve memory at an offset closer to bottom of RAM

Currently, the area to preserve boot memory is reserved at the top of
RAM. This leaves fadump vulnerable to memory hot-remove operations. As
memory for fadump has to be reserved early in the boot process, fadump
can't be registered after a memory hot-remove operation. Though this
problem can't be eleminated completely, the impact can be minimized by
reserving memory at an offset closer to bottom of the RAM. The offset
for fadump memory reservation can be any value greater than fadump boot
memory size.
