fs: ceph: CURRENT_TIME with ktime_get_real_ts()

CURRENT_TIME is not y2038 safe.  The macro will be deleted and all the
references to it will be replaced by ktime_get_* apis.

struct timespec is also not y2038 safe.  Retain timespec for timestamp
representation here as ceph uses it internally everywhere.  These
references will be changed to use struct timespec64 in a separate patch.

The current_fs_time() api is being changed to use vfs struct inode* as
an argument instead of struct super_block*.

Set the new mds client request r_stamp field using ktime_get_real_ts()
instead of using current_fs_time().

Also, since r_stamp is used as mtime on the server, use timespec_trunc()
to truncate the timestamp, using the right granularity from the
superblock.

This api will be transitioned to be y2038 safe along with vfs.
