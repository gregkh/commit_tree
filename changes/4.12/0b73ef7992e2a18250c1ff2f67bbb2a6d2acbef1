NFC: remove TI nfcwilink driver

It appears that TI WiLink devices including NFC (WL185x/WL189x) never
shipped. The only information I found were announcements in Feb
2012 about the parts. There's been no activity on this driver besided
common changes since initially added in Jan 2012. There's also no in
users that instantiate the platform device (nor DT bindings).

This is a first step in removing TI ST (shared transport) driver in
favor of extending the BT hci_ll driver to support WL183x chips.
