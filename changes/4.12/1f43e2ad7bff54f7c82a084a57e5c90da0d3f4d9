f2fs: introduce CP_TRIMMED_FLAG to avoid unneeded discard

Introduce CP_TRIMMED_FLAG to indicate all invalid block were trimmed
before umount, so once we do mount with image which contain the flag,
we don't record invalid blocks as undiscard one, when fstrim is being
triggered, we can avoid issuing redundant discard commands.
