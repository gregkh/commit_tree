tpm_tis: convert to using locality callbacks

This patch converts tpm_tis to use of the new tpm class ops
request_locality, and relinquish_locality.

With the move to using the callbacks, release_locality is changed so
that we now release the locality even if there is no request pending.

This required some changes to the tpm_tis_core_init code path to
make sure locality is requested when needed:

  - tpm2_probe code path will end up calling request/release through
    callbacks, so request_locality prior to tpm2_probe not needed.

  - probe_itpm makes calls to tpm_tis_send_data which no longer calls
    request_locality, so add request_locality prior to tpm_tis_send_data
    calls. Also drop release_locality call in middleof probe_itpm, and
    keep locality until release_locality called at end of probe_itpm.
