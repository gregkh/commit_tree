bpf: properly reset caller saved regs after helper call and ld_abs/ind

Currently, after performing helper calls, we clear all caller saved
registers, that is r0 - r5 and fill r0 depending on struct bpf_func_proto
specification. The way we reset these regs can affect pruning decisions
in later paths, since we only reset register's imm to 0 and type to
NOT_INIT. However, we leave out clearing of other variables such as id,
min_value, max_value, etc, which can later on lead to pruning mismatches
due to stale data.
