powerpc/iommu/vfio_spapr_tce: Cleanup iommu_table disposal

At the moment iommu_table can be disposed by either calling
iommu_table_free() directly or it_ops::free(); the only implementation
of free() is in IODA2 - pnv_ioda2_table_free() - and it calls
iommu_table_free() anyway.

As we are going to have reference counting on tables, we need an unified
way of disposing tables.

This moves it_ops::free() call into iommu_free_table() and makes use
of the latter. The free() callback now handles only platform-specific
data.

As from now on the iommu_free_table() calls it_ops->free(), we need
to have it_ops initialized before calling iommu_free_table() so this
moves this initialization in pnv_pci_ioda2_create_table().

This should cause no behavioral change.
