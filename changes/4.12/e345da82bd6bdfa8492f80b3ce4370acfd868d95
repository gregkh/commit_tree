drm/edid: Add 10 bpc quirk for LGD 764 panel in HP zBook 17 G2

The builtin eDP panel in the HP zBook 17 G2 supports 10 bpc,
as advertised by the Laptops product specs and verified via
injecting a fixed edid + photometer measurements, but edid
reports unknown depth, so drivers fall back to 6 bpc.

Add a quirk to get the full 10 bpc.
