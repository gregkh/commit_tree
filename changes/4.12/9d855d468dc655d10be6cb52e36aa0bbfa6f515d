platform/x86: intel_pmc_ipc: Fix iTCO_wdt GCS memory mapping failure

iTCO_wdt driver need access to PMC_CFG GCR register to modify the
noreboot setting. Currently, this is done by passing PMC_CFG reg
address as memory resource to watchdog driver and allowing it directly
modify the PMC_CFG register. But currently PMC driver also has
requirement to memory map the entire GCR register space in this driver.
This causes mem request failure in watchdog driver. So this patch fixes
this issue by adding API to update noreboot flag and passes them
to watchdog driver via platform data.
