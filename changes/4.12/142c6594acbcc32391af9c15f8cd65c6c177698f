bonding: refine bond_fold_stats() wrap detection

Some device drivers reset their stats at down/up events, possibly
fooling bonding stats, since they operate with relative deltas.

It is nearly not possible to fix drivers, since some of them compute the
tx/rx counters based on per rx/tx queue stats, and the queues can be
reconfigured (ethtool -L) between the down/up sequence.

Lets avoid accumulating 'negative' values that render bonding stats
useless.

It is better to lose small deltas, assuming the bonding stats are
fetched at a reasonable frequency.
