arm64: kdump: add VMCOREINFO's for user-space tools

In addition to common VMCOREINFO's defined in
crash_save_vmcoreinfo_init(), we need to know, for crash utility,
  - kimage_voffset
  - PHYS_OFFSET
to examine the contents of a dump file (/proc/vmcore) correctly
due to the introduction of KASLR (CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE) in v4.6.

  - VA_BITS
is also required for makedumpfile command.

arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo() appends them to the dump file.
More VMCOREINFO's may be added later.
