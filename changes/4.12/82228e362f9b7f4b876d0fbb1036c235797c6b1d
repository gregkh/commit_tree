powerpc/pseries: Skip using reserved virtual address range

Now that we use all the available virtual address range, we need to make
sure we don't generate VSID such that it overlaps with the reserved vsid
range. Reserved vsid range include the virtual address range used by the
adjunct partition and also the VRMA virtual segment. We find the context
value that can result in generating such a VSID and reserve it early in
boot.

We don't look at the adjunct range, because for now we disable the
adjunct usage in a Linux LPAR via CAS interface.
