mm: fix new crash in unmapped_area_topdown()

Trinity gets kernel BUG at mm/mmap.c:1963! in about 3 minutes of
mmap testing.  That's the VM_BUG_ON(gap_end < gap_start) at the
end of unmapped_area_topdown().  Linus points out how MAP_FIXED
(which does not have to respect our stack guard gap intentions)
could result in gap_end below gap_start there.  Fix that, and
the similar case in its alternative, unmapped_area().
