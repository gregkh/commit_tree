staging: comedi: jr3_pci: omit pointless debug info

`jr3_pci_open()` outputs several debug log messages containing serial
numbers of the sensors (one per subdevice) along with a pointer to the
subdevice private data structure.  The latter is of no use, so reformat
the debug log to omit it.

`jr3_pci_alloc_spriv()` outputs a debug log message containing more
useless information about the remapped base address of the board
registers, the sensor registers, and the difference between them.  Get
rid of it.
