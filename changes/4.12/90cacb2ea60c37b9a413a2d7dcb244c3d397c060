net/smc: guarantee reset of write_blocked for heavy workload

If peer indicates write_blocked, the cursor state of the received data
should be send to the peer immediately (in smc_tx_consumer_update()).
Afterwards the write_blocked indicator is cleared.

If there is no free slot for another write request, sending is postponed
to worker smc_tx_work, and the write_blocked indicator is not cleared.
Therefore another clearing check is needed in smc_tx_work().
