KVM: mark requests that need synchronization

kvm_make_all_requests() provides a synchronization that waits until all
kicked VCPUs have acknowledged the kick.  This is important for
KVM_REQ_MMU_RELOAD as it prevents freeing while lockless paging is
underway.

This patch adds the synchronization property into all requests that are
currently being used with kvm_make_all_requests() in order to preserve
the current behavior and only introduce a new framework.  Removing it
from requests where it is not necessary is left for future patches.
