ALSA: fireface: add hwdep interface

This commit adds hwdep interface so as the other drivers for audio and
music units on IEEE 1394 have.

This interface is designed for mixer/control applications. By using this
interface, an application can get information about firewire node, can
lock/unlock kernel streaming and can get notification at starting/stopping
kernel streaming.
