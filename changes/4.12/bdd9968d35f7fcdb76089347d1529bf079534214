power: supply: lp8788: prevent out of bounds array access

val might become 7 in which case stime[7] (array of length 7) would be
accessed during the scnprintf call later and that will cause issues.
Obviously, string concatenation is not intended here so just a comma needs
to be added to fix the issue.
