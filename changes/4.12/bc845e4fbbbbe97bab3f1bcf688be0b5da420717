ARM: KVM: Implement HVC_RESET_VECTORS stub hypercall in the init code

In order to restore HYP mode to its original condition, KVM currently
implements __kvm_hyp_reset(). As we're moving towards a hyp-stub
defined API, it becomes necessary to implement HVC_RESET_VECTORS.

This patch adds the HVC_RESET_VECTORS hypercall to the KVM init
code, which so far lacked any form of hypercall support.
