powerpc/pasemi: Do not process external or decrementer interrupts from sreset

PA Semi will wake from low power state at the system reset interrupt,
with the event encoded in SRR1, rather than waking at the interrupt
vector that corresponds to that event.

The system reset handler for this platform decodes SRR1 event reason
and calls the interrupt handler to process it directly from the system
reset handlre.

A subsequent change will treat the system reset interrupt as a Linux NMI
with its own per-CPU stack, and this will no longer work. Remove the
external and decrementer handlers from the system reset handler.

- The external exception remains raised and will fire again at the
  EE interrupt vector when system reset returns.

- The decrementer is set to 1 so it will be raised again and fire when
  the system reset returns.

It is possible to branch to an idle handler from the system reset
interrupt (like POWER does), then restore a normal stack and restore
this optimisation. But simplicity wins for now.
