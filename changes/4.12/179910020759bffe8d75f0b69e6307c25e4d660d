qed: Correct endian order of MAC passed to MFW

The management firmware is running on a Big Endian processor,
and when running on LE platform HW is configured to swap access
to memory shared between management firmware and driver on
32-bit granulariy.

As a result, for matters of simplicity most of the APIs between
driver and management firmware are based on 32-bit variables.
MAC settings are one exception, as driver needs to fill a byte
array when indicating to management firmware that primary MAC
has changed.
Due to the swap, driver must make sure that the mac that was
provided in byte-order would be translated into native order,
otherwise after the swap the management firmware would read
it swapped.
