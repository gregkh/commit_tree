Bluetooth: hci_uart: add serdev driver support library

This adds library functions for serdev based BT drivers. This is largely
copied from hci_ldisc.c and modified to use serdev calls. There's a little
bit of duplication, but I avoided intermixing this as the ldisc code should
eventually go away.
