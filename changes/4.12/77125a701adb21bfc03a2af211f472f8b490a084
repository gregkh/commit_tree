ARM: sunxi: h3-h5: Add PLL_PERIPH0 clock to the R_CCU

The AR100 clock within the R_CCU (PRCM) has the PLL_PERIPH0 as one of
its parents.

This adds the reference in the device tree describing this relationship.
This patch uses a raw number for the clock index to ease merging by
avoiding cross tree dependencies.
