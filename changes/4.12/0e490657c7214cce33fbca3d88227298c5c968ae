staging: wilc1000: Fix problem with wrong vif index

The vif->idx value is always 0 for two interfaces.

wl->vif_num = 0;

loop {
     ...

     vif->idx = wl->vif_num;
     ...
     wl->vif_num = i;
      ....
     i++;
     ...
}

At present, vif->idx is assigned the value of wl->vif_num
at the beginning of this block and device is initialized
based on this index value.
In the next iteration, wl->vif_num is still 0 as it is only updated
later but gets assigned to vif->idx in the beginning. This causes problems
later when we try to reference a particular interface and also while
configuring the firmware.

This patch moves the assignment to vif->idx from the beginning
of the block to after wl->vif_num is updated with latest value of i.

Fixes: commit 735bb39ca3be ("staging: wilc1000: simplify vif[i]->ndev accesses")
