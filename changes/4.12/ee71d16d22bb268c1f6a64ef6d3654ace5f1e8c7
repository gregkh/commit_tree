s390/mm: make TASK_SIZE independent from the number of page table levels

The TASK_SIZE for a process should be maximum possible size of the address
space, 2GB for a 31-bit process and 8PB for a 64-bit process. The number
of page table levels required for a given memory layout is a consequence
of the mapped memory areas and their location.
