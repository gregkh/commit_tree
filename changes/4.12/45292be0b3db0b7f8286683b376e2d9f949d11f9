staging: comedi: jr3_pci: fix possible null pointer dereference

For some reason, the driver does not consider allocation of the
subdevice private data to be a fatal error when attaching the COMEDI
device.  It tests the subdevice private data pointer for validity at
certain points, but omits some crucial tests.  In particular,
`jr3_pci_auto_attach()` calls `jr3_pci_alloc_spriv()` to allocate and
initialize the subdevice private data, but the same function
subsequently dereferences the pointer to access the `next_time_min` and
`next_time_max` members without checking it first.  The other missing
test is in the timer expiry routine `jr3_pci_poll_dev()`, but it will
crash before it gets that far.

Fix the bug by returning `-ENOMEM` from `jr3_pci_auto_attach()` as soon
as one of the calls to `jr3_pci_alloc_spriv()` returns `NULL`.  The
COMEDI core will subsequently call `jr3_pci_detach()` to clean up.
