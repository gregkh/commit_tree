xen/x86: Do not call xen_init_time_ops() until shared_info is initialized

Routines that are set by xen_init_time_ops() use shared_info's
pvclock_vcpu_time_info area. This area is not properly available until
shared_info is mapped in xen_setup_shared_info().

This became especially problematic due to commit dd759d93f4dd ("x86/timers:
Add simple udelay calibration") where we end up reading tsc_to_system_mul
from xen_dummy_shared_info (i.e. getting zero value) and then trying
to divide by it in pvclock_tsc_khz().
