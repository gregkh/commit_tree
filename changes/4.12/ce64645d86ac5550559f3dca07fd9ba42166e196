drm/i915: use variadic macros and arrays to choose port/pipe based registers

This allows the use of more than 3 ports/pipes/whatever without tricks,
even if the register offsets are not evenly spaced.

There's the risk of out of bounds access if we're not careful; currently
that would "just" lead to the wrong register offset being used. It might
be possible to add build bug ons for build time constant indexing.

We already have ports defined up to E, not sure if we might have bugs
related to them and the current _PORT3() macro.
