net: vrf: Make add_fib_rules per network namespace flag

Commit 1aa6c4f6b8cd8 ("net: vrf: Add l3mdev rules on first device create")
adds the l3mdev FIB rule the first time a VRF device is created. However,
it only creates the rule once and only in the namespace the first device
is created - which may not be init_net. Fix by using the net_generic
capability to make the add_fib_rules flag per network namespace.
