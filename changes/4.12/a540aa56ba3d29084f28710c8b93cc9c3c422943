powerpc/powernv/iommu: Add real mode version of iommu_table_ops::exchange()

In real mode, TCE tables are invalidated using special
cache-inhibited store instructions which are not available in
virtual mode

This defines and implements exchange_rm() callback. This does not
define set_rm/clear_rm/flush_rm callbacks as there is no user for those -
exchange/exchange_rm are only to be used by KVM for VFIO.

The exchange_rm callback is defined for IODA1/IODA2 powernv platforms.

This replaces list_for_each_entry_rcu with its lockless version as
from now on pnv_pci_ioda2_tce_invalidate() can be called in
the real mode too.
