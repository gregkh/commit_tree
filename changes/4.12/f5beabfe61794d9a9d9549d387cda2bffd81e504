ACPI / scan: Apply default enumeration to devices with ACPI drivers

The current code in acpi_bus_attach() is inconsistent with respect
to device objects with ACPI drivers bound to them, as it allows
ACPI drivers to bind to device objects with existing "physical"
device companions, but it doesn't allow "physical" device objects
to be created for ACPI device objects with ACPI drivers bound to
them.  Thus, in some cases, the outcome depends on the ordering
of events which is confusing at best.

For this reason, modify acpi_bus_attach() to call
acpi_default_enumeration() for device objects with the
pnp.type.platform_id flag set regardless of whether or not
any ACPI drivers are bound to them.
