HID: sony: Improve navigation controller axis/button mapping

The navigation controller is a DS3 (sixaxis) with fewer physical
axes and buttons. It utilizes the same HID report as the DS3 and
thus reports axes/buttons which aren't physically present.
Currently many non-existing buttons and axes are reported, which
we are now removing.

For the axes/buttons which do exist, we make the axis/button mapping
similar to the DS3.
