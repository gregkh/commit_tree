dm verity: switch to using asynchronous hash crypto API

Use of the synchronous digest API limits dm-verity to using pure
CPU based algorithm providers and rules out the use of off CPU
algorithm providers which are normally asynchronous by nature,
potentially freeing CPU cycles.

This can reduce performance per Watt in situations such as during
boot time when a lot of concurrent file accesses are made to the
protected volume.
