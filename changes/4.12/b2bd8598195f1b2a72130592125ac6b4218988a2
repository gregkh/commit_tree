mm, vmstat: print non-populated zones in zoneinfo

Initscripts can use the information (protection levels) from
/proc/zoneinfo to configure vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio at boot.

vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio is an array of ratios for each configured zone
on the system.  If a zone is not populated on an arch, /proc/zoneinfo
suppresses its output.

This results in there not being a 1:1 mapping between the set of zones
emitted by /proc/zoneinfo and the zones configured by
vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio.

This patch shows statistics for non-populated zones in /proc/zoneinfo.
The zones exist and hold a spot in the vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio array.
Without this patch, it is not possible to determine which index in the
array controls which zone if one or more zones on the system are not
populated.

Remaining users of walk_zones_in_node() are unchanged.  Files such as
/proc/pagetypeinfo require certain zone data to be initialized properly
for display, which is not done for unpopulated zones.
