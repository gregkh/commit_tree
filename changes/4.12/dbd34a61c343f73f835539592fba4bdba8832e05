Revert "scsi: ufs: add queries retry mechanism"

This reverts commit 61e073590b82a539654626ecae91b8fab11db3f3.

The patch introduced redundant query retries as we already had such
mechanism provided with _retry functions.  Both ufshcd_read_desc and
ufshcd_read_unit_desc_param functions call ufshcd_query_descriptor_retry
wrapper.
