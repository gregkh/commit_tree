rcu: Semicolon inside RCU_TRACE() for rcu.h

The current use of "RCU_TRACE(statement);" can cause odd bugs, especially
where "statement" is a local-variable declaration, as it can leave a
misplaced ";" in the source code.  This commit therefore converts these
to "RCU_TRACE(statement;)", which avoids the misplaced ";".
