ver_linux: Use /usr/bin/awk instead of /bin/awk

Most Linux distributions contain awk in /usr/bin by default,
not in /bin. This script's suggested use is for creating version
information for bug reporting.

This has been tested on a number of different distributions,
including Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Debian, Centos, Arch Linuxi,
and Poky!
