mtd: nand: allocate aligned buffers if NAND_OWN_BUFFERS is unset

Some NAND controllers are using DMA engine requiring a specific
buffer alignment.  The core provides no guarantee on the nand_buffers
pointers, which forces some drivers to allocate their own buffers
and pass the NAND_OWN_BUFFERS flag.

Rework the nand_buffers allocation logic to allocate each buffer
independently.  This should make most NAND controllers/DMA engine
happy, and allow us to get rid of these custom buf allocation in
NAND controller drivers.
