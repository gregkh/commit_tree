Input: xpad - sync supported devices with xboxdrv

The userspace xboxdrv driver [0] contains some USB IDs unknown to the
kernel driver. I have created a simple script [1] to extract the missing
devices and add them to xpad.

A quick google search confirmed that all the new devices called
Fightstick/pad are Arcade-type devices [2] where the
MAP_TRIGGERS_TO_BUTTONS option should apply.

There are some similar devices in the existing device table where this
flag is not set, but I did refrain from changing those.
