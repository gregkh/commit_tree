openvswitch: Deferred fifo API change.

add_deferred_actions() API currently requires actions to be passed in
as a fully encoded netlink message. So far both 'sample' and 'recirc'
actions happens to carry actions as fully encoded netlink messages.
However, this requirement is more restrictive than necessary, future
patch will need to pass in action lists that are not fully encoded
by themselves.
