dt: bindings: add pmu0 regs for USB PHYs on Allwinner H3/V3s/A64

Allwinner H3/V3s/A64 SoCs have a special USB PHY0 that can route to two
controllers: one is MUSB and the other is a EHCI/OHCI pair.

When it's routed to EHCI/OHCI pair, it will needs a "pmu0" regs to
tweak, like other EHCI/OHCI pairs in Allwinner SoCs.

Add this to the binding of USB PHYs on Allwinner H3/V3s/A64.
