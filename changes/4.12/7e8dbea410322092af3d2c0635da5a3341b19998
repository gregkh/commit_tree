staging: bcm2835-camera: Remove explicit cache flush operations

The camera code has an explicit cache flush operation
which is not portable.  Now that vc04_services is using portable
DMA APIs that already do the cache flushing, explicit flushes
should no longer be needed.

The one call to __cpuc_flush_dcache_area has been removed.

Testing:
	The offical V2 camera for the RPI was tested on a RPI 3
	running in 32 bit mode(armhf).  The cheese application
	and ffmpeg was used to view and stream video from the
	camera.  Nothing new seems to be broken without the
	cache flushing.
