mac80211: rewrite monitor mode delivery logic

The monitor mode delivery logic makes it hard to add any
kind of filtering in an efficient way, because the monitor
SKB is created first and then passed to all interfaces.

Rewrite the logic to create the monitor SKB the first time
it's actually needed, and then keep delivering it.
