scsi: sd: Write lock zone for REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES

For a zoned block device, sd_zbc_complete() handles zone write unlock on
completion of a REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES command but the zone write locking
is missing from sd_setup_write_zeroes_cmnd(). This patch fixes this
problem by locking the target zone of a REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES request.
