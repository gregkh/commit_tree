checkpatch: improve the embedded function name test for patch contexts

The current test works only for a single patch context as it is done in
the foreach ($rawlines) loop that precedes the loop where the actual
$context_function variable is used.

Move the set of $context_function into the foreach (@lines) loop where
it is useful for each patch context.
