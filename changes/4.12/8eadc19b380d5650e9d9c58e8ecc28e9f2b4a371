drm/i915: Extend debugfs/i915_drop_caches to call i915_gem_shrink_all()

Sometimes we want to explicitly page out all available objects from igt,
i.e. call i915_gem_shrink_all() and check that subsequent operations
succeed. This adds DROP_SHRINK_ALL [0x8] to the set of flags for
debugfs/i915_drop_caches for that purpose.
