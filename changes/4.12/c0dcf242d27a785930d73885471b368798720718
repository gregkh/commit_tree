USB: serial: ti_usb_3410_5052: always require a bulk-out endpoint

These devices always require at least one bulk-out endpoint so let core
verify that.

This avoids attempting to send bulk data to the default pipe when
downloading firmware in boot mode.

Note that further endpoints are still needed when not in boot mode.
