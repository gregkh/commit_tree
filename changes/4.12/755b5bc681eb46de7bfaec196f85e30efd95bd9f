fsnotify: Remove indirection from mark list addition

Adding notification mark to object list has been currently done through
fsnotify_add_{inode|vfsmount}_mark() helpers from
fsnotify_add_mark_locked() which call fsnotify_add_mark_list(). Remove
this unnecessary indirection to simplify the code.

Pushing all the locking to fsnotify_add_mark_list() also allows us to
allocate the connector structure with GFP_KERNEL mode.
