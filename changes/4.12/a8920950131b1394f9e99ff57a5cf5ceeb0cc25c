KVM: s390: introduce adapter interrupt inject function

Inject adapter interrupts on a specified adapter which allows to
retrieve the adapter flags, e.g. if the adapter is subject to AIS
facility or not. And add documentation for this interface.

For adapters subject to AIS, handle the airq injection suppression
for a given ISC according to the interruption mode:
- before injection, if NO-Interruptions Mode, just return 0 and
  suppress, otherwise, allow the injection.
- after injection, if SINGLE-Interruption Mode, change it to
  NO-Interruptions Mode to suppress the following interrupts.

Besides, add tracepoint for suppressed airq and AIS mode transitions.
