locking/ww_mutex: Improve test to cover acquire context changes

Currently each thread starts an acquire context only once, and
performs all its loop iterations under it.

This means that the Wound/Wait relations between threads are fixed.

To make things a little more realistic and cover more of the
functionality with the test, open a new acquire context for each loop.
