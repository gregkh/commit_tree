HID: wacom: Have wacom_tpc_irq guard against possible NULL dereference

The following Smatch complaint was generated in response to commit
2a6cdbd ("HID: wacom: Introduce new 'touch_input' device"):

    drivers/hid/wacom_wac.c:1586 wacom_tpc_irq()
             error: we previously assumed 'wacom->touch_input' could be null (see line 1577)

The 'touch_input' and 'pen_input' variables point to the 'struct input_dev'
used for relaying touch and pen events to userspace, respectively. If a
device does not have a touch interface or pen interface, the associated
input variable is NULL. The 'wacom_tpc_irq()' function is responsible for
forwarding input reports to a more-specific IRQ handler function. An
unknown report could theoretically be mistaken as e.g. a touch report
on a device which does not have a touch interface. This can be prevented
by only calling the pen/touch functions are called when the pen/touch
pointers are valid.
