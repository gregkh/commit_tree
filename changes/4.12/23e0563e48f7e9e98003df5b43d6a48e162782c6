drm/amdgpu: clear freed mappings immediately when BO may be freed

Also, add the fence of the clear operations to the BO to ensure that
the underlying memory can only be re-used after all PTEs pointing to
it have been cleared.

This avoids the following sequence of events that could be triggered
by user space:

1. Submit a CS that accesses some BO _without_ adding that BO to the
   buffer list.
2. Free that BO.
3. Some other task re-uses the memory underlying the BO.
4. The CS is submitted to the hardware and accesses memory that is
   now already in use by somebody else.

By clearing the page tables immediately in step 2, a GPU VM fault will
be triggered in step 4 instead of wild memory accesses.

v2: use amdgpu_bo_fence directly
