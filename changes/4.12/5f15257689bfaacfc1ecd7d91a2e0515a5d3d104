drm/fb-helper: Add multi buffer support for cma fbdev

This patch add a config to support to create multi buffer for cma fbdev.
Such as double buffer and triple buffer.

Cma fbdev is convient to add a legency fbdev. And still many Android
devices use fbdev now and at least double buffer is needed for these
Android devices, so that a buffer flip can be operated. It will need
some time for Android device vendors to abondon legency fbdev. So multi
buffer for fbdev is needed.
