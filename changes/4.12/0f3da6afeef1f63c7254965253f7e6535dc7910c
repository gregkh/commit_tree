net: dsa: check out-of-range ageing time value

If a DSA switch driver cannot program an ageing time value due to it
being out-of-range, switchdev will raise a stack trace before failing.

To fix this, add ageing_time_min and ageing_time_max members to the
dsa_switch in order for the switch drivers to optionally specify their
supported ageing time limits.

The DSA core will now check for provided ageing time limits and return
-ERANGE from the switchdev prepare phase if the value is out-of-range.
