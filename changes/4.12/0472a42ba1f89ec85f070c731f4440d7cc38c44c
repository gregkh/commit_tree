md/raid5: remove over-loading of ->bi_phys_segments.

When a read request, which bypassed the cache, fails, we need to retry
it through the cache.
This involves attaching it to a sequence of stripe_heads, and it may not
be possible to get all the stripe_heads we need at once.
We do what we can, and record how far we got in ->bi_phys_segments so
we can pick up again later.

There is only ever one bio which may have a non-zero offset stored in
->bi_phys_segments, the one that is either active in the single thread
which calls retry_aligned_read(), or is in conf->retry_read_aligned
waiting for retry_aligned_read() to be called again.

So we only need to store one offset value.  This can be in a local
variable passed between remove_bio_from_retry() and
retry_aligned_read(), or in the r5conf structure next to the
->retry_read_aligned pointer.

Storing it there allows the last usage of ->bi_phys_segments to be
removed from md/raid5.c.
