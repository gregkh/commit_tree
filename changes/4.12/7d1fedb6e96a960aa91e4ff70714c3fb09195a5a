dm btree: fix for dm_btree_find_lowest_key()

dm_btree_find_lowest_key() is giving incorrect results.  find_key()
traverses the btree correctly for finding the highest key, but there is
an error in the way it traverses the btree for retrieving the lowest
key.  dm_btree_find_lowest_key() fetches the first key of the rightmost
block of the btree instead of fetching the first key from the leftmost
block.

Fix this by conditionally passing the correct parameter to value64()
based on the @find_highest flag.
