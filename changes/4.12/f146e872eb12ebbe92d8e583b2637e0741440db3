net: caif: Fix a sleep-in-atomic bug in cfpkt_create_pfx

The kernel may sleep under a rcu read lock in cfpkt_create_pfx, and the
function call path is:
cfcnfg_linkup_rsp (acquire the lock by rcu_read_lock)
  cfctrl_linkdown_req
    cfpkt_create
      cfpkt_create_pfx
        alloc_skb(GFP_KERNEL) --> may sleep
cfserl_receive (acquire the lock by rcu_read_lock)
  cfpkt_split
    cfpkt_create_pfx
      alloc_skb(GFP_KERNEL) --> may sleep

There is "in_interrupt" in cfpkt_create_pfx to decide use "GFP_KERNEL" or
"GFP_ATOMIC". In this situation, "GFP_KERNEL" is used because the function
is called under a rcu read lock, instead in interrupt.

To fix it, only "GFP_ATOMIC" is used in cfpkt_create_pfx.
