block, bfq: use pointer entity->sched_data only if set

In the function __bfq_deactivate_entity, the pointer
entity->sched_data could happen to be used before being properly
initialized. This led to a NULL pointer dereference. This commit fixes
this bug by just using this pointer only where it is safe to do so.
