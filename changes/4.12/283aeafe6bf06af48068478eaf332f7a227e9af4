i40evf: allocate queues before we setup the interrupts and q_vectors

This matches the ordering of how we free stuff during reset and remove.
It also makes logical sense because we set the interrupts based on the
number of queues. Currently this doesn't really matter in practice.
However a future patch moves the assignment of num_active_queues into
i40evf_alloc_queues, which is required by
i40evf_set_interrupt_capability.
