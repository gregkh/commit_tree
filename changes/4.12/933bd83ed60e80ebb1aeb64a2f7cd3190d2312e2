netfilter: batch synchronize_net calls during hook unregister

synchronize_net is expensive and slows down netns cleanup a lot.

We have two APIs to unregister a hook:
nf_unregister_net_hook (which calls synchronize_net())
and
nf_unregister_net_hooks (calls nf_unregister_net_hook in a loop)

Make nf_unregister_net_hook a wapper around new helper
__nf_unregister_net_hook, which unlinks the hook but does not free it.

Then, we can call that helper in nf_unregister_net_hooks and then
call synchronize_net() only once.

Andrey Konovalov reports this change improves syzkaller fuzzing speed at
least twice.
