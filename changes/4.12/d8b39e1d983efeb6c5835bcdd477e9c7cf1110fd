selftests: ftrace: Add a test to test function triggers to start and stop tracing

This adds a test to test the function tiggers traceon and traceoff to make
sure that it starts and stops tracing when a function is hit.

The test performs the following:

 o Enables all events

 o Writes schedule:traceoff into set_ftrace_filter

 o Makes sure the tigger exists in the file

 o Makes sure the trace file no longer grows

 o Makes sure that tracing_on is now zero

 o Clears the trace file

 o Makes sure it's still empty

 o Removes the trigger

 o Makes sure tracing is still off (tracing_on is zero)

 o Writes schedule:traceon into set_ftrace_filter

 o Makes sure the trace file is no longer empty

 o Makes sure that tracing_on file is set to one

 o Removes the trigger

 o Makes sure the trigger is no longer there

 o Writes schedule:traceoff:3 into set_ftrace_filter

 o Makes sure that tracing_on turns off

   . Writes 1 into tracing_on

   . Makes sure that it turns off 2 more times

 o Writes 1 into tracing_on

 o Makes sure that tracing_on is still a one
