lightnvm: don't print a warning for ADDR_EMPTY

Reading from ADDR_EMPTY is out of bounds.  The current code generates a
static checker warning because we check for out of bounds "lba" before
we check for ADDR_EMPTY, so the second check is always false.  It looks
like we intended ADDR_EMPTY to be a no-op without printing a warning.
