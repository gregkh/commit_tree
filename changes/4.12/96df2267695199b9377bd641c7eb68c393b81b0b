KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Preserve storage control bits

PR KVM page fault handler performs eaddr to pte translation for a guest,
however kvmppc_mmu_book3s_64_xlate() does not preserve WIMG bits
(storage control) in the kvmppc_pte struct. If PR KVM is running as
a second level guest under HV KVM, and PR KVM tries inserting HPT entry,
this fails in HV KVM if it already has this mapping.

This preserves WIMG bits between kvmppc_mmu_book3s_64_xlate() and
kvmppc_mmu_map_page().
