arm: kvm: move kvm_vgic_global_state out of .text section

The kvm_vgic_global_state struct contains a static key which is
written to by jump_label_init() at boot time. So in preparation of
making .text regions truly (well, almost truly) read-only, mark
kvm_vgic_global_state __ro_after_init so it moves to the .rodata
section instead.
