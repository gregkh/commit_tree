s390/qeth: unbreak OSM and OSN support

commit b4d72c08b358 ("qeth: bridgeport support - basic control")
broke the support for OSM and OSN devices as follows:

As OSM and OSN are L2 only, qeth_core_probe_device() does an early
setup by loading the l2 discipline and calling qeth_l2_probe_device().
In this context, adding the l2-specific bridgeport sysfs attributes
via qeth_l2_create_device_attributes() hits a BUG_ON in fs/sysfs/group.c,
since the basic sysfs infrastructure for the device hasn't been
established yet.

Note that OSN actually has its own unique sysfs attributes
(qeth_osn_devtype), so the additional attributes shouldn't be created
at all.
For OSM, add a new qeth_l2_devtype that contains all the common
and l2-specific sysfs attributes.
When qeth_core_probe_device() does early setup for OSM or OSN, assign
the corresponding devtype so that the ccwgroup probe code creates the
full set of sysfs attributes.
This allows us to skip qeth_l2_create_device_attributes() in case
of an early setup.

Any device that can't do early setup will initially have only the
generic sysfs attributes, and when it's probed later
qeth_l2_probe_device() adds the l2-specific attributes.

If an early-setup device is removed (by calling ccwgroup_ungroup()),
device_unregister() will - using the devtype - delete the
l2-specific attributes before qeth_l2_remove_device() is called.
So make sure to not remove them twice.

What complicates the issue is that qeth_l2_probe_device() and
qeth_l2_remove_device() is also called on a device when its
layer2 attribute changes (ie. its layer mode is switched).
For early-setup devices this wouldn't work properly - we wouldn't
remove the l2-specific attributes when switching to L3.
But switching the layer mode doesn't actually make any sense;
we already decided that the device can only operate in L2!
So just refuse to switch the layer mode on such devices. Note that
OSN doesn't have a layer2 attribute, so we only need to special-case
OSM.

Based on an initial patch by Ursula Braun.
