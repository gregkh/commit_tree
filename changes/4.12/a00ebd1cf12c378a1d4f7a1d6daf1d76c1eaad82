drbd: fix request leak introduced by locking/atomic, kref: Kill kref_sub()

When killing kref_sub(), the unconditional additional kref_get()
was not properly paired with the necessary kref_put(), causing
a leak of struct drbd_requests (~ 224 Bytes) per submitted bio,
and breaking DRBD in general, as the destructor of those "drbd_requests"
does more than just the mempoll_free().
