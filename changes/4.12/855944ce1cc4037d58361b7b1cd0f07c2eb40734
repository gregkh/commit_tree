ftgmac100: Add a reset task and use it for link changes

Link speed changes require a full HW reset. This isn't done
properly at the moment. It will involve delays and thus isn't
suitable to do from the link poll callback.

So let's create a reset_task that we can queue up when the
link changes. It will be useful for various cases of error
handling as well.
