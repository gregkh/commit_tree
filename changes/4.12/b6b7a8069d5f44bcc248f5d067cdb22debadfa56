arm64: KVM: Do not corrupt registers on failed 64bit CP read

If we fail to emulate a mrrc instruction, we:
1) deliver an exception,
2) spit a nastygram on the console,
3) write back some garbage to Rt/Rt2

While 1) and 2) are perfectly acceptable, 3) is out of the scope of
the architecture... Let's mimick the code in kvm_handle_cp_32 and
be more cautious.
