nfp: remove the refresh of all ports optimization

The code refreshing the eth port state was trying to update state
of all ports of the card.  Unfortunately to safely walk the port
list we would have to hold the port lock, which we can't due to
lock ordering constraints against rtnl.

Make the per-port sync refresh and async refresh of all ports
completely separate routines.
