netfilter: nf_tables: can't assume lock is acquired when dumping set elems

When dumping the elements related to a specified set, we may invoke the
nf_tables_dump_set with the NFNL_SUBSYS_NFTABLES lock not acquired. So
we should use the proper rcu operation to avoid race condition, just
like other nft dump operations.
