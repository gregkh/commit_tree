KVM: PPC: Align the table size to system page size

At the moment the userspace can request a table smaller than a page size
and this value will be stored as kvmppc_spapr_tce_table::size.
However the actual allocated size will still be aligned to the system
page size as alloc_page() is used there.

This aligns the table size up to the system page size. It should not
change the existing behaviour but when in-kernel TCE acceleration patchset
reaches the upstream kernel, this will allow small TCE tables be
accelerated as well: PCI IODA iommu_table allocator already aligns
the size and, without this patch, an IOMMU group won't attach to LIOBN
due to the mismatching table size.
