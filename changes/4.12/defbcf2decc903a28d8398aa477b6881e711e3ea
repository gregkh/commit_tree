af_unix: Add sockaddr length checks before accessing sa_family in bind and connect handlers

Verify that the caller-provided sockaddr structure is large enough to
contain the sa_family field, before accessing it in bind() and connect()
handlers of the AF_UNIX socket. Since neither syscall enforces a minimum
size of the corresponding memory region, very short sockaddrs (zero or
one byte long) result in operating on uninitialized memory while
referencing .sa_family.
