md/raid1: skip data copy for behind io for discard request

discard request doesn't have data attached, so it's meaningless to
allocate memory and copy from original bio for behind IO. And the copy
is bogus because bio_copy_data_partial can't handle discard request.

We don't support writesame/writezeros request so far.
