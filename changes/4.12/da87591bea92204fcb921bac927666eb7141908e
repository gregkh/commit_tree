nvme: only consider exit latency when choosing useful non-op power states

When a NVMe is in non-op states, the latency is exlat.
The latency will be enlat + exlat only when the NVMe tries to transit
from operational state right atfer it begins to transit to
non-operational state, which should be a rare case.

Therefore, as Andy Lutomirski suggests, use exlat only when deciding power
states to trainsit to.
