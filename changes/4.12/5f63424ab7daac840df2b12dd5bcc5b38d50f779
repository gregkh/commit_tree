USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add Olimex ARM-USB-TINY(H) PIDs

This patch adds support for recognition of ARM-USB-TINY(H) devices which
are almost identical to ARM-USB-OCD(H) but lacking separate barrel jack
and serial console.

By suggestion from Johan Hovold it is possible to replace
ftdi_jtag_quirk with a bit more generic construction. Since all
Olimex-ARM debuggers has exactly two ports, we could safely always use
only second port within the debugger family.
