block: Fix list corruption of blk stats callback list

When CFQ calls wbt_disable_default(), it will call
blk_stat_remove_callback() to stop gathering IO statistics for the
purposes of writeback throttling. Later, when request_queue is
unregistered, wbt_exit() will call blk_stat_remove_callback() again
which will try to delete callback from the list again and possibly cause
list corruption.

Fix the problem by making wbt_disable_default() called wbt_exit() which
is properly guarded against being called multiple times.
