x86/mm: Make mmap(MAP_32BIT) work correctly

mmap(MAP_32BIT) is broken due to the dependency on the TIF_ADDR32 thread
flag.

For 64bit applications MAP_32BIT will force legacy bottom-up allocations and
the 1GB address space restriction even if the application issued a compat
syscall, which should not be subject of these restrictions.

For 32bit applications, which issue 64bit syscalls the newly introduced
mmap base separation into 64-bit and compat bases changed the behaviour
because now a 64-bit mapping is returned, but due to the TIF_ADDR32
dependency MAP_32BIT is ignored. Before the separation a 32-bit mapping was
returned, so the MAP_32BIT handling was irrelevant.

Replace the check for TIF_ADDR32 with a check for the compat syscall. That
solves both the 64-bit issuing a compat syscall and the 32-bit issuing a
64-bit syscall problems.
