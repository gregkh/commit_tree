virtio-net: enable TSO/checksum offloads for Q-in-Q vlans

Since virtio does not provide it's own ndo_features_check handler,
TSO, and now checksum offload, are disabled for stacked vlans.
Re-enable the support and let the host take care of it.  This
restores/improves Guest-to-Guest performance over Q-in-Q vlans.
