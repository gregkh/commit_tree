clk: ti: divider: try to fix ti_clk_register_divider

Commit 6c0afb503937 ("clk: ti: convert to use proper register
definition for all accesses") converted all register accesses in
the TI clk driver to use a proper struct instead of a void
pointer casted struct that fits into a u32. Unfortunately, it
missed a conversion here in the didivder code, leading to a
compiler warning like so:

drivers/clk/ti/divider.c: In function 'ti_clk_register_divider':
drivers/clk/ti/divider.c:460:8: error: 'reg' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Treating a 'u32' variable as a structure leads to a stack
overflow here, and the register address we pass down is never
initialized. Convert this part of the code as well so things
work properly.
