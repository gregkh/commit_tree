IB/SA: Add OPA addr header

When importing the patch 57520751445b (IB/SA: Add OPA path record type),
a new header file should have been added to the repo as part of the
patch.  However, as the patch didn't apply cleanly using git am, I
instead used patch manually, and followed that up with git add -u, which
misses new files.  This adds the new file back in.
