net: ena: fix rare uncompleted admin command false alarm

The current flow to detect admin completion is:
while (command_not_completed) {
	if (timeout)
		error

	check_for_completion()
		sleep()
   }
So in case the sleep took more than the timeout
(in case the thread/workqueue was not scheduled due to higher priority
task or prolonged VMexit), the driver can detect a stall even if
the completion is present.

The fix changes the order of this function to first check for
completion and only after that check if the timeout expired.
