igb: Clear Rx buffer_info in configure instead of clean

This change makes it so that instead of going through the entire ring on Rx
cleanup we only go through the region that was designated to be cleaned up
and stop when we reach the region where new allocations should start.

In addition we can avoid having to perform a memset on the Rx buffer_info
structures until we are about to start using the ring again.  By deferring
this we can avoid dirtying the cache any more than we have to which can
help to improve the time needed to bring the interface down and then back
up again in a reset or suspend/resume cycle.
