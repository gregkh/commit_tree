xfs: fix spurious spin_is_locked() assert failures on non-smp kernels

The 0-day kernel test robot reports assertion failures on
!CONFIG_SMP kernels due to failed spin_is_locked() checks. As it
turns out, spin_is_locked() is hardcoded to return zero on
!CONFIG_SMP kernels and so this function cannot be relied on to
verify spinlock state in this configuration.

To avoid this problem, replace the associated asserts with lockdep
variants that do the right thing regardless of kernel configuration.
Drop the one assert that checks for an unlocked lock as there is no
suitable lockdep variant for that case. This moves the spinlock
checks from XFS debug code to lockdep, but generally provides the
same level of protection.
