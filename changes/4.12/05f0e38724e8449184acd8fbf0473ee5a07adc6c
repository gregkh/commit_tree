fanotify: Release SRCU lock when waiting for userspace response

When userspace task processing fanotify permission events screws up and
does not respond, fsnotify_mark_srcu SRCU is held indefinitely which
causes further hangs in the whole notification subsystem. Although we
cannot easily solve the problem of operations blocked waiting for
response from userspace, we can at least somewhat localize the damage by
dropping SRCU lock before waiting for userspace response and reacquiring
it when userspace responds.
