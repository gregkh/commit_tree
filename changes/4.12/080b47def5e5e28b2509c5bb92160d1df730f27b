MicroSemi Switchtec management interface driver

Microsemi's "Switchtec" line of PCI switch devices is already well
supported by the kernel with standard PCI switch drivers.  However, the
Switchtec device advertises a special management endpoint with a separate
PCI function address and class code.  This endpoint enables some additional
functionality which includes:

 * Packet and Byte Counters
 * Switch Firmware Upgrades
 * Event and Error logs
 * Querying port link status
 * Custom user firmware commands

Add a switchtec kernel module which provides PCI driver that exposes a char
device.  The char device provides userspace access to this interface
through read, write and (optionally) poll calls.

A userspace tool and library which utilizes this interface is available
at [1].  This tool takes inspiration (and borrows some code) from
nvme-cli [2].  The tool is largely complete at this time but additional
features may be added in the future.
