iommu/arm-smmu: Simplify ASID/VMID handling

Calculating ASIDs/VMIDs dynamically from arm_smmu_cfg was a neat trick,
but the global uniqueness workaround makes it somewhat more awkward, and
means we end up having to pass extra state around in certain cases just
to keep a handle on the offset.

We already have 16 bits going spare in arm_smmu_cfg; let's just
precalculate an ASID/VMID, plop it in there, and tidy up the users
accordingly. We'd also need something like this anyway if we ever get
near to thinking about SVM, so it's no bad thing.
