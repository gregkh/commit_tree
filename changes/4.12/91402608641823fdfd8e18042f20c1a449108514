scsi: pmcraid: fix lock imbalance in pmcraid_reset_reload()

sparse found a bug that has always been present since the driver was
merged:

drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:2353:12: warning: context imbalance in 'pmcraid_reset_reload' - different lock contexts for basic block

Fix this by using a common unlock goto label, and also reduce the
indentation level in the function.
