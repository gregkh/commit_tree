Revert "extcon: usb-gpio: add support for ACPI gpio interface"

The commit 942c7924a51e introduced a check for ACPI handle for the
device that never appears on any ACPI-enabled platform so far. It seems
a confusion with extcon-intel-int3496 which does support ACPI-enabled
platforms.

Revert commit 942c7924a51e to avoid any confusion in the future.
