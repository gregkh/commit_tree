rbd: fix error handling around rbd_init_disk()

add_disk() takes an extra reference on disk->queue, which is put in
put_disk() -> disk_release().  Avoiding blk_cleanup_queue() (which also
puts the queue) until add_disk() sets GENHD_FL_UP works for the queue
itself, but leaks various queue internals.  Conditioning tag_set freeing
on GENHD_FL_UP is wrong too: all error paths after rbd_init_disk() leak
the tag_set.

Move the final "announce" steps out of rbd_dev_device_setup() so that
it can be unwound like any other function.  Leave "announce" steps to
do_rbd_add/remove().
