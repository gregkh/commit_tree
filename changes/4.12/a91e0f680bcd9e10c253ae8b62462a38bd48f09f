lib/cmdline.c: fix get_options() overflow while parsing ranges

When using get_options() it's possible to specify a range of numbers,
like 1-100500.  The problem is that it doesn't track array size while
calling internally to get_range() which iterates over the range and
fills the memory with numbers.
