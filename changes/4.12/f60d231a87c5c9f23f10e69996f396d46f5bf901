srcu: Crude control of expedited grace periods

SRCU's implementation of expedited grace periods has always assumed
that the SRCU instance is idle when the expedited request arrives.
This commit improves this a bit by maintaining a count of the number
of outstanding expedited requests, thus allowing prior non-expedited
grace periods accommodate these requests by shifting to expedited mode.
However, any non-expedited wait already in progress will still wait for
the full duration.

Improved control of expedited grace periods is planned, but one step
at a time.
