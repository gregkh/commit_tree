net/mlx5: E-Switch, Refactor fast path FDB table creation in switchdev mode

Refactor the creation of the fast path FDB table that holds the
offloaded rules in SRIOV switchdev mode into it's own function.

This will be used in the next patch to be able and re-create the
table under different settings without going through legacy mode.

This patch doesn't change any functionality.
