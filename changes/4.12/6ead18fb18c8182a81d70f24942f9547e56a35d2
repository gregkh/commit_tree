selftests/bpf: add a test case to check verifier pointer arithmetic

With clang/llvm 4.0+, the test case is able to generate
the following pattern:
....
440: (b7) r1 = 15
441: (05) goto pc+73
515: (79) r6 = *(u64 *)(r10 -152)
516: (bf) r7 = r10
517: (07) r7 += -112
518: (bf) r2 = r7
519: (0f) r2 += r1
520: (71) r1 = *(u8 *)(r8 +0)
521: (73) *(u8 *)(r2 +45) = r1
....

commit 332270fdc8b6 ("bpf: enhance verifier to understand stack
pointer arithmetic") improved verifier to handle such a pattern.
This patch adds a C test case to actually generate such a pattern.
A dummy tracepoint interface is used to load the program
into the kernel.
