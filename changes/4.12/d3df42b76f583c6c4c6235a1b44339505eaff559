drm/i915: Wait for reset to complete before returning from debugfs/i915_wedged

Provide some serialisation between user operations by waiting for the
reset initiated by setting i915_wedged to complete.

The automatic wait here makes
        echo 1 > i915_wedged; cat i915_error_state
do the right thing, and not risk reporting "No error collected".
