lightnvm: Use blk_init_request_from_bio() instead of open-coding it

This patch changes the behavior of the lightnvm driver as follows:
* REQ_FAILFAST_MASK is set for read-ahead requests.
* If no I/O priority has been set in the bio, the I/O priority is
  copied from the I/O context.
* The rq_disk member is initialized if bio->bi_bdev != NULL.
* The bio sector offset is copied into req->__sector instead of
  retaining the value -1 set by blk_mq_alloc_request().
* req->errors is initialized to zero.
