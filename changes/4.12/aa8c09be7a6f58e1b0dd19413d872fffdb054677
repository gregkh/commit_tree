arm64: mmu: move TLB maintenance from callers to create_mapping_late()

In preparation of refactoring the kernel mapping logic so that text regions
are never mapped writable, which would require adding explicit TLB
maintenance to new call sites of create_mapping_late() (which is currently
invoked twice from the same function), move the TLB maintenance from the
call site into create_mapping_late() itself, and change it from a full
TLB flush into a flush by VA, which is more appropriate here.

Also, given that create_mapping_late() has evolved into a routine that only
updates protection bits on existing mappings, rename it to
update_mapping_prot()
