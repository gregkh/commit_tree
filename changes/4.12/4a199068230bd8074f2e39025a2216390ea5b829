mac80211: disentangle iflist_mtx and chanctx_mtx

At least on iwlwifi, sometimes lockdep complains that we can
lock
 chanctx_mtx -> mvm.mutex -> iflist_mtx
 (due to iterate_interfaces)
and
 iflist_mtx -> chanctx_mtx

Remove the latter dependency in mac80211 by using the RTNL
that we already hold in one case, and can relatively easily
achieve in the other case.
