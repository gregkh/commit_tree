drm/i915/gvt: fix error return check for copy_gma_to_hva()

From commit 73dec95e6ba3 ("drm/i915: Emit to ringbuffer directly"),
copy_gma_to_hva() now returns copied data length instead of 0, so
need to change error return check for that.

Note: Looks this is caused by backmerge conflict resolving, so
4.11-rc4 is not impacted as commit 73dec95e6ba3 ("drm/i915: Emit to
ringbuffer directly") is not in 4.11. But need to fix this before I
can apply 4.12 stuff against drm-intel-next correctly.

Fixes: e5c1ff14757a ("Backmerge tag 'v4.11-rc4' into drm-next")
