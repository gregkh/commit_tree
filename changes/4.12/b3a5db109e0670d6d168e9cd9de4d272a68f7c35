netfilter: conntrack: use u8 for extension sizes again

commit 223b02d923ecd7c84cf9780bb3686f455d279279
("netfilter: nf_conntrack: reserve two bytes for nf_ct_ext->len")
had to increase size of the extension offsets because total size of the
extensions had increased to a point where u8 did overflow.

3 years later we've managed to diet extensions a bit and we no longer
need u16.  Furthermore we can now add a compile-time assertion for this
problem.
