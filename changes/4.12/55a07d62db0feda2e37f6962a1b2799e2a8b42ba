HID: sony: Calibrate DS4 motion sensors

The DS4 motion sensors require calibration for accurate operation.
This patch adds calibration for both the accelerometer and the
gyroscope. Calibration requires reading device specific scaling
factors and offsets. For precision reasons we store these values
as a numerator and denominator and apply the values when processing
the data.
