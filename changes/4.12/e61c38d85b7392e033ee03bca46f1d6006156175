serial: imx: setup DCEDTE early and ensure DCD and RI irqs to be off

If the UART is operated in DTE mode and UCR3_DCD or UCR3_RI are 1 (which
is the reset default) and the opposite side pulls the respective line to
its active level the irq triggers after it is requested in .probe.

These irqs were already disabled in .startup but this might be too late.

Also setup of the UFCR_DCEDTE bit (currently done in .set_termios) is
done very late which is critical as it also controls direction of some
pins.

So setup UFCR_DCEDTE earlier (in .probe) and also disable the broken
irqs in DTE mode there before requesting irqs.
