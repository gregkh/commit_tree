IB/core: For multicast functions, verify that LIDs are multicast LIDs

The Infiniband spec defines "A multicast address is defined by a
MGID and a MLID" (section 10.5).  Currently the MLID value is not
validated.

Add check to verify that the MLID value is in the correct address
range.

Fixes: 0c33aeedb2cf ("[IB] Add checks to multicast attach and detach")
