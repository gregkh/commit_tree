KEYS: encrypted: sanitize all key material

For keys of type "encrypted", consistently zero sensitive key material
before freeing it.  This was already being done for the decrypted
payloads of encrypted keys, but not for the master key and the keys
derived from the master key.

Out of an abundance of caution and because it is trivial to do so, also
zero buffers containing the key payload in encrypted form, although
depending on how the encrypted-keys feature is used such information
does not necessarily need to be kept secret.
