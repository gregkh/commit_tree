x86/boot/64: Rename start_cpu()

It doesn't really start a CPU but does a far jump to C code. So call it
that. Eliminate the unconditional JMP to it from secondary_startup_64()
but make the jump to C code piece part of secondary_startup_64()
instead.

Also, it doesn't need to be a global symbol either so make it a local
label. One less needlessly global symbol in the symbol table.

No functionality change.
