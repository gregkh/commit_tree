drm: vblank cannot be enabled if dev->irq_enabled is false

Since we cannot enable the vblank if !dev->irq_enabled, we assert that
checking for both !vblank->enabled and !dev->irq_enabled is tautological
and only need the former. The only time it may differ is when racing
with drm_irq_uninstall(), but that will then disable the vblank and
wakeup the waiters.
