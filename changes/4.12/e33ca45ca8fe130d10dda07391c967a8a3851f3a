platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: reorganize LED-related code

Move around LED definitions and callbacks to eliminate the need for
forward declarations and ensure code is organized LED-wise, not
action-wise.  Reorder assignments inside designated initializers so that
they are in the same order as struct led_classdev fields in
include/linux/leds.h.  Adjust whitespace to make checkpatch happy.
