isdn: Fix a sleep-in-atomic bug

The driver may sleep under a spin lock, the function call path is:
isdn_ppp_mp_receive (acquire the lock)
  isdn_ppp_mp_reassembly
    isdn_ppp_push_higher
      isdn_ppp_decompress
        isdn_ppp_ccp_reset_trans
          isdn_ppp_ccp_reset_alloc_state
            kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL) --> may sleep

To fixed it, the "GFP_KERNEL" is replaced with "GFP_ATOMIC".
