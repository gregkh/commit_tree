crypto: s5p-sss - Close possible race for completed requests

Driver is capable of handling only one request at a time and it stores
it in its state container struct s5p_aes_dev.  This stored request must be
protected between concurrent invocations (e.g. completing current
request and scheduling new one).  Combination of lock and "busy" field
is used for that purpose.

When "busy" field is true, the driver will not accept new request thus
it will not overwrite currently handled data.

However commit 28b62b145868 ("crypto: s5p-sss - Fix spinlock recursion
on LRW(AES)") moved some of the write to "busy" field out of a lock
protected critical section.  This might lead to potential race between
completing current request and scheduling a new one.  Effectively the
request completion might try to operate on new crypto request.
