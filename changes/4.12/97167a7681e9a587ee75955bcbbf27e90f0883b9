mm/madvise.c: clean up MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE and MADV_HWPOISON

This cleans up handling MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE and MADV_HWPOISON called
through madvise() system call.

* madvise_memory_failure() was misleading to accommodate handling of
  both memory_failure() as well as soft_offline_page() functions.
  Basically it handles memory error injection from user space which
  can go either way as memory failure or soft offline. Renamed as
  madvise_inject_error() instead.

* Renamed struct page pointer 'p' to 'page'.

* pr_info() was essentially printing PFN value but it said 'page'
  which was misleading. Made the process virtual address explicit.
