checkpatch: allow space leading blank lines in email headers

Allow a leading space and otherwise blank link in the email headers as
it can be a line wrapped Spamassassin multiple line string or any other
valid rfc 2822/5322 email header.

The line with space causes checkpatch to erroneously think that it's in
the content body, as opposed to headers and thus flag a mail header as
an unwrapped long comment line.
