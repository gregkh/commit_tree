ext4: trim return value and 'dir' argument from ext4_insert_dentry()

In the initial implementation of ext4 encryption, the filename was
encrypted in ext4_insert_dentry(), which could fail and also required
access to the 'dir' inode.  Since then ext4 filename encryption has been
changed to encrypt the filename earlier, so we can revert the additions
to ext4_insert_dentry().
