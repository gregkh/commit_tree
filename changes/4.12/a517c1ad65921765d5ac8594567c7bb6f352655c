KVM: MIPS: Init timer frequency from callback

Currently the software emulated timer is initialised to a frequency of
100MHz by kvm_mips_init_count(), but this isn't suitable for VZ where
the frequency of the guest timer matches that of the host.

Add a count_hz argument so the caller can specify the default frequency,
and move the call from kvm_arch_vcpu_create() to the implementation
specific vcpu_setup() callback, so that VZ can specify a different
frequency.
