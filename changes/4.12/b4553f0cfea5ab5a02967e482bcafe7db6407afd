doc: Add mid-boot operation to expedited grace periods

This commit adds a description of how expedited grace periods operate
during the mid-boot "dead zone", which starts when the scheduler spawns
the first kthread and ends when all of RCU's kthreads have been spawned.
In short, before mid-boot, synchronous grace periods can be a no-op.
After the end of mid-boot, workqueues may be used.  During mid-boot,
the requesting task drivees the expedited grace period.
