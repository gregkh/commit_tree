drm/i915: Replace reset_wait_queue with default_wake_function

If we change the wait_queue_t from using the autoremove_wake_function to
the default_wake_function, we no longer have to restore the wait_queue_t
entry on the wait_queue_head_t list after being woken up by it, as we
are unusual in sleeping multiple times on the same wait_queue_t.
