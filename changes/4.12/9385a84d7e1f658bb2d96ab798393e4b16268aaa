fsnotify: Pass fsnotify_iter_info into handle_event handler

Pass fsnotify_iter_info into ->handle_event() handler so that it can
release and reacquire SRCU lock via fsnotify_prepare_user_wait() and
fsnotify_finish_user_wait() functions.  These functions also make sure
current marks are appropriately pinned so that iteration protected by
srcu in fsnotify() stays safe.
