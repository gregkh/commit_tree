i40e/i40evf: Remove VF Rx csum offload for tunneled packets

Rx checksum offload for tunneled packets was never being negotiated or
requested by VF. This capability was assumed by default and enabled in
current hardware for VF. Going forward, this feature needs to be disabled
or advanced ptypes should be negotiated with PF in the future.
