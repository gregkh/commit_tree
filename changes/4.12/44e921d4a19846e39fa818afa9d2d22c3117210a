drm/i915: Optimize VLV/CHV display FIFO updates

Use I915_{READ,WRITE}_FW() for updating the DSPARB registers on
VLV/CHV. This is less expesive as we can grab the uncore.lock across
the entire sequence of reads and writes instead of each register
access grabbing it.

This also allows us to eliminate the dsparb lock entirely as the
uncore.lock now effectively protects the contents of the DSPARB
registers.
