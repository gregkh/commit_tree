kvm: make KVM_COALESCED_MMIO_PAGE_OFFSET public

Its value has never changed; we might as well make it part of the ABI instead
of using the return value of KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION(KVM_CAP_COALESCED_MMIO).

Because PPC does not always make MMIO available, the code has to be made
dependent on CONFIG_KVM_MMIO rather than KVM_COALESCED_MMIO_PAGE_OFFSET.
