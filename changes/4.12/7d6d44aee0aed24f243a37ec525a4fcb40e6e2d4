vt: set mouse selection word-chars to gpm's default

Since forever, gpm was this code's only user, and it overrides the table on
start so the default was never seen -- until Bill Allombert's "consolation"
came in.  The in-kernel set is "A-Za-z0-9_" which fails to catch typical
file names, etc.  Let's change this to gpm's conservative default, ie
"-A-Za-z0-9_./"; most terminals include more, for example xfce4-terminal has
"-A-Za-z0-9,./?%&#:_=+@~".

There's some discussion at https://bugs.debian.org/846587
