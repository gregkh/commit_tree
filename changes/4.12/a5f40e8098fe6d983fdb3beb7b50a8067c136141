PCI: Don't allow unbinding host controllers that aren't prepared

Many PCI host controller drivers aren't prepared to have their devices
unbound from them forcefully (e.g., through /sys/.../<driver>/unbind), as
they don't provide any driver .remove callback, where they'd detach the
root bus, release resources, etc. Keeping the driver built in (i.e., not a
loadable module) is not enough; and providing no .remove callback just
means we don't do any teardown.

To rule out the possibility of unbinding a device via sysfs, we need to set
the ".suppress_bind_attrs" field.

I found the suspect drivers via the following search:

  git grep -l platform_driver $(git grep -L -e '\.remove' -e suppress_bind_attrs drivers/pci/)

Then I inspected them to ensure that
(a) they set up a PCI bus in their probe() and
(b) they don't have a remove() callback for undoing the setup
