ASoC: da7213: Fix incorrect usage of bitwise '&' operator for SRM check

In the SRM lock check section of code the '&' bitwise operator is
used as part of checking lock status. Functionally the code works
as intended, but the conditional statement is a boolean comparison
so should really use '&&' logical operator instead. This commit
rectifies this discrepancy.
