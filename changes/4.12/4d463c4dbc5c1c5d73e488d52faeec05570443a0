xdp: use common helper for netlink extended ack reporting

Small follow-up to d74a32acd59a ("xdp: use netlink extended ACK reporting")
in order to let drivers all use the same NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD() helper macro
for reporting. This also ensures that we consistently add the driver's
prefix for dumping the report in user space to indicate that the error
message is driver specific and not coming from core code. Furthermore,
NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD() now reuses NL_SET_ERR_MSG() and thus makes all macros
check the pointer as suggested.
