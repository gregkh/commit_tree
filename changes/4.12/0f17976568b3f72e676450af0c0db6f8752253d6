ftrace: Fix regression with module command in stack_trace_filter

When doing the following command:

 # echo ":mod:kvm_intel" > /sys/kernel/tracing/stack_trace_filter

it triggered a crash.

This happened with the clean up of probes. It required all callers to the
regex function (doing ftrace filtering) to have ops->private be a pointer to
a trace_array. But for the stack tracer, that is not the case.

Allow for the ops->private to be NULL, and change the function command
callbacks to handle the trace_array pointer being NULL as well.
