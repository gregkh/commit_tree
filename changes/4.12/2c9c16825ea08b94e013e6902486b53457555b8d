net/smc: do not use IB_SEND_INLINE together with mapped data

smc specifies IB_SEND_INLINE for IB_WR_SEND ib_post_send calls, but
provides a mapped buffer to be sent. This is inconsistent, since
IB_SEND_INLINE works without mapped buffer. Problem has not been
detected in the past, because tests had been limited to Connect X3 cards
from Mellanox, whose mlx4 driver just ignored the IB_SEND_INLINE flag.
For now, the IB_SEND_INLINE flag is removed.
