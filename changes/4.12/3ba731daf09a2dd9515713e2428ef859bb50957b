KVM: MIPS/VZ: Emulate hit CACHE ops for Octeon III

Octeon III doesn't implement the optional GuestCtl0.CG bit to allow
guest mode to execute virtual address based CACHE instructions, so
implement emulation of a few important ones specifically for Octeon III
in response to a GPSI exception.

Currently the main reason to perform these operations is for icache
synchronisation, so they are implemented as a simple icache flush with
local_flush_icache_range().
