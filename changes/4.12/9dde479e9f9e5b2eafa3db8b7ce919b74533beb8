staging: iio: adis16060: Remove iio_dev mlock and refactor code

The IIO subsystem is redefining iio_dev->mlock to be used by
the IIO core only for protecting device operating mode changes.
ie. Changes between INDIO_DIRECT_MODE, INDIO_BUFFER_* modes.

In this driver, mlock was being used to protect hardware state changes.

In the driver, buf_lock protects both the adis16060_spi_write() and
adis16060_spi_read() functions and both are always called in
pair. First write, then read. Refactor the code to have
one single function adis16060_spi_write_than_read() protected by
the buf_lock.  This removes the need for additional locking via
mlock, so this locking is removed.
