srcu: Consolidate batch checking into rcu_all_batches_empty()

The srcu_reschedule() function invokes rcu_batch_empty() on each of
the four rcu_batch structures in the srcu_struct in question twice.
Given that this check will also be needed in cleanup_srcu_struct(), this
commit consolidates these four checks into a new rcu_all_batches_empty()
function.
