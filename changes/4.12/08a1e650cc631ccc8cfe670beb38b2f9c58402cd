powerpc: Fixup LPCR:PECE and HEIC setting on POWER9

We need to set LPES in order for normal external interrupts (0x500)
to be directed to the guest while running in guest state.

We also need HEIC set to prevent them to be sent to the host while
in host state.

With XIVE the host never gets one of these and wouldn't know how to
handle it. All host external interrupts come in via the new
hypervisor virtualization interrupts vector.
