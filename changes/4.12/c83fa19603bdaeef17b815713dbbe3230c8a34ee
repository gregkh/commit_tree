netfilter: nf_log: don't call synchronize_rcu in nf_log_unset

nf_log_unregister() (which is what gets called in the logger backends
module exit paths) does a (required, module is removed) synchronize_rcu().

But nf_log_unset() is only called from pernet exit handlers. It doesn't
free any memory so there appears to be no need to call synchronize_rcu.

v2: Liping Zhang points out that nf_log_unregister() needs to be called
after pernet unregister, else rmmod would become unsafe.
