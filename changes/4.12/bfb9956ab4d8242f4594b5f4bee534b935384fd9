powerpc/mm: Fix crash in page table dump with huge pages

The page table dump code doesn't know about huge pages, so currently
it crashes (or walks random memory, usually leading to a crash), if it
finds a huge page. On Book3S we only see huge pages in the Linux page
tables when we're using the P9 Radix MMU.

Teaching the code to properly handle huge pages is a bit more involved,
so for now just prevent the crash.
