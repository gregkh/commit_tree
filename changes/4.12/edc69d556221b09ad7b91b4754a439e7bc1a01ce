usb: gadget: mv_udc: clarify a switch with an implicit fall-through

Rearrange statements in mv_ep_enable function so that it’s obvious
what the switch does and how zlt, ios and mult variables are
initialised.  Most notably, this gets rid of an implicit fall-through
so people don’t have to wonder whether it was intenional or not.
