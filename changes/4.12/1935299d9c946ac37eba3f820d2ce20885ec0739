net: tcp: Refine the __tcp_select_window

1. Move the "window = tp->rcv_wnd;" into the condition block without
tp->rx_opt.rcv_wscale.
Because it is unnecessary when enable wscale;

2. Use the macro ALIGN instead of two statements.
The two statements are used to make window align to 1<<wscale.
Use the ALIGN is more clearer.

3. Use the rounddown to make codes clearer.
