perf/callchain: Force USER_DS when invoking perf_callchain_user()

Perf can generate and record a user callchain in response to a synchronous
request, such as a tracepoint firing. If this happens under set_fs(KERNEL_DS),
then we can end up walking the user stack (and dereferencing/saving whatever we
find there) without the protections usually afforded by checks such as
access_ok.

Rather than play whack-a-mole with each architecture's stack unwinding
implementation, fix the root of the problem by ensuring that we force USER_DS
when invoking perf_callchain_user from the perf core.
