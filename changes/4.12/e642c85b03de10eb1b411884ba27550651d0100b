drm/i915: Remove superfluous i915_add_request_no_flush() helper

The only time we need to emit a flush inside request emission is after
an execbuffer, for which we can use the full __i915_add_request(). All
other instances want the simpler i915_add_request() without flushing, so
remove the useless helper.
