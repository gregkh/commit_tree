lightnvm: double-clear of dev->lun_map on target init error

The dev->lun_map bits are cleared twice if an target init error occurs.
First in the target clean routine, and then next in the nvm_tgt_create
error function. Make sure that it is only cleared once by extending
nvm_remove_tgt_devi() with a clear bit, such that clearing of bits can
ignored when cleaning up a successful initialized target.
