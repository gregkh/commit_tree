staging: dgnc: replace usleep_range with udelay

udelay is impelmented using a busy-wait loop and consumes CPU cycles
while usleep_range is implemented using interrupts.cls_flush_uart_write()
is called after a channel lock is acquired i.e. an atomic context.
Hence delay in this method should use udelay instead of usleep_range.
