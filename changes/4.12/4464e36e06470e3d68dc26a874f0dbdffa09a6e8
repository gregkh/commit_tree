dm raid: fix table line argument order in status

Commit 3a1c1ef2f ("dm raid: enhance status interface and fixup
takeover/raid0") added new table line arguments and introduced an
ordering flaw.  The sequence of the raid10_copies and raid10_format
raid parameters got reversed which causes lvm2 userspace to fail by
falsely assuming a changed table line.

Sequence those 2 parameters as before so that old lvm2 can function
properly with new kernels by adjusting the table line output as
documented in Documentation/device-mapper/dm-raid.txt.

Also, add missing version 1.10.1 highlight to the documention.
