tty: serial_core: Add name field to uart_port struct

Introduce a field to store name of uart_port that can be used to easily
identify UART port instances on a system that has more than one UART
instance. The name is of the form ttyXN(eg. ttyS0, ttyAMA0,..) where N
is number that particular UART instance.
This field will be useful when printing debug info for a particular port
or in register IRQs with unique IRQ name. Port name is populated during
uart_add_one_port().
