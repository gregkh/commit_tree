x86/boot: Fix Sparse warning by including required header file

Include declarations for various symbols defined in the error.h header file
to fix the following Sparse warnings:

  arch/x86/boot/compressed/error.c:8:6:
	warning: symbol 'warn' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/error.c:15:6:
	warning: symbol 'error' was not declared. Should it be static?
