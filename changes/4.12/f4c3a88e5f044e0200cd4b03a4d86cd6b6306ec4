drm/i915: Tighten mmio arrays for MIPI_PORT

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_dsi.c: In function ‘intel_dsi_prepare’:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_dsi.c:1308:1: error: the frame size of 2488 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

which is caused by the compiling expanding every _MIPI_PORT into an
on-stack array of u32[3] at every callsite. Not sure why only one
machine/compiler appears susceptible, but with a minor tweak to _MIPI_PORT
we can defer the error until later.

This is a partial revert of commit ce64645d86ac ("drm/i915: use variadic
macros and arrays to choose port/pipe based registers") for a particular
bad offender.
