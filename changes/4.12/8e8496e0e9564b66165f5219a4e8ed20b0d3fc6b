ntb_transport: fix bug calculating num_qps_mw

A divide by zero error occurs if qp_count is less than mw_count because
num_qps_mw is calculated to be zero. The calculation appears to be
incorrect.

The requirement is for num_qps_mw to be set to qp_count / mw_count
with any remainder divided among the earlier mws.

For example, if mw_count is 5 and qp_count is 12 then mws 0 and 1
will have 3 qps per window and mws 2 through 4 will have 2 qps per window.
Thus, when mw_num < qp_count % mw_count, num_qps_mw is 1 higher
than when mw_num >= qp_count.
