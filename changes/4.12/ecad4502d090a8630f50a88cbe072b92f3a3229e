powernv-cpuidle: Validate DT property array size

The various properties associated with powernv idle states such as
names, flags, residency-ns, latencies-ns, psscr, psscr-mask are
exposed in the device-tree as property arrays such the pointwise
entries in each of these arrays correspond to the properties of the
same idle state.

This patch validates that the lengths of the property arrays are the
same. If there is a mismatch, the patch will ensure that we bail out
and not expose the platform idle states via cpuidle.
