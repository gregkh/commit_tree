iommu/of: Prepare for deferred IOMMU configuration

IOMMU configuration represents unchanging properties of the hardware,
and as such should only need happen once in a device's lifetime, but
the necessary interaction with the IOMMU device and driver complicates
exactly when that point should be.

Since the only reasonable tool available for handling the inter-device
dependency is probe deferral, we need to prepare of_iommu_configure()
to run later than it is currently called (i.e. at driver probe rather
than device creation), to handle being retried, and to tell whether a
not-yet present IOMMU should be waited for or skipped (by virtue of
having declared a built-in driver or not).
