powerpc/prom: Increase minimum RMA size to 512MB

When booting very large systems with a large initrd, we run out of
space early in boot for either RTAS or the flattened device tree (FDT).
Boot fails with messages like:

	Could not allocate memory for RTAS
or
	No memory for flatten_device_tree (no room)

Increasing the minimum RMA size to 512MB fixes the problem. This
should not have an impact on smaller LPARs (with 256MB memory),
as the firmware will cap the RMA to the memory assigned to the LPAR.

Fix is based on input/discussions with Michael Ellerman. Thanks to
Praveen K. Pandey for testing on a large system.
