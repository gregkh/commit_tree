arm64: cpuinfo: remove I-cache VIPT aliasing detection

The CCSIDR_EL1.{NumSets,Associativity,LineSize} fields are only for use
in conjunction with set/way cache maintenance and are not guaranteed to
represent the actual microarchitectural features of a design.

The architecture explicitly states:

| You cannot make any inference about the actual sizes of caches based
| on these parameters.

We currently use these fields to determine whether or the I-cache is
aliasing, which is bogus and known to break on some platforms. Instead,
assume the I-cache is always aliasing if it advertises a VIPT policy.
