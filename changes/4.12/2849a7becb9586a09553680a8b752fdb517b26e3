nvme/lightnvm: Prevent small buffer overflow in nvme_nvm_identify

There are two closely named structs in lightnvm:
struct nvme_nvm_addr_format and
struct nvme_addr_format.

The first struct has 4 reserved bytes at the end, the second does not.
(gdb) p sizeof(struct nvme_nvm_addr_format)
$1 = 16
(gdb) p sizeof(struct nvm_addr_format)
$2 = 12

In the nvme_nvm_identify function we memcpy from the larger struct to the
smaller struct. We incorrectly pass the length of the larger struct
and overflow by 4 bytes, lets not do that.
