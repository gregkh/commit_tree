iommu/arm-smmu: Restrict domain attributes to UNMANAGED domains

The ARM SMMU drivers provide a DOMAIN_ATTR_NESTING domain attribute,
which allows callers of the IOMMU API to request that the page table
for a domain is installed at stage-2, if supported by the hardware.

Since setting this attribute only makes sense for UNMANAGED domains,
this patch returns -ENODEV if the domain_{get,set}_attr operations are
called on other domain types.
