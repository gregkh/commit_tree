drivers/perf: arm_pmu: simplify cpu_pmu_request_irqs()

The ARM PMU framework code always uses armpmu_dispatch_irq as its common
IRQ handler. Passing this down from cpu_pmu_init() is somewhat
pointless, and gets in the way of refactoring.

This patch makes cpu_pmu_request_irqs() always use armpmu_dispatch_irq
as the handler when requesting IRQs, and removes the handler parameter
from its prototype.
