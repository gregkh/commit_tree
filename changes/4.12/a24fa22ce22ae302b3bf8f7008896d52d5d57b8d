xen/blkback: don't use xen_blkif_get() in xen-blkback kthread

There is no need to use xen_blkif_get()/xen_blkif_put() in the kthread
of xen-blkback. Thread stopping is synchronous and using the blkif
reference counting in the kthread will avoid to ever let the reference
count drop to zero at the end of an I/O running concurrent to
disconnecting and multiple rings.

Setting ring->xenblkd to NULL after stopping the kthread isn't needed
as the kthread does this already.
