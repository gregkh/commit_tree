crypto: chcr - Increase priority of AEAD algos.

templates(gcm,ccm etc) inherit priority value of driver to
calculate its priority. In some cases template priority becomes
 more than driver priority for same algo.
Without this patch we will not be able to use driver authenc algos. It will
be good if it pushed in stable kernel.
