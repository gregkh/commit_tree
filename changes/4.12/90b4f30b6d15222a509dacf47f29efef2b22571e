hwmon: (coretemp) Handle frozen hotplug state correctly

The recent conversion to the hotplug state machine missed that the original
hotplug notifiers did not execute in the frozen state, which is used on
suspend on resume.

This does not matter on single socket machines, but on multi socket systems
this breaks when the device for a non-boot socket is removed when the last
CPU of that socket is brought offline. The device removal locks up the
machine hard w/o any debug output.

Prevent executing the hotplug callbacks when cpuhp_tasks_frozen is true.

Thanks to Tommi for providing debug information patiently while I failed to
spot the obvious.
