KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Implement vgic_its_has_attr_regs and attr_regs_access

This patch implements vgic_its_has_attr_regs and vgic_its_attr_regs_access
upon the MMIO framework. VGIC ITS KVM device KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ITS_REGS
group becomes functional.

At least GITS_CREADR and GITS_IIDR require to differentiate a guest write
action from a user access. As such let's introduce a new uaccess_its_write
vgic_register_region callback.
