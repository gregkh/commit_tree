ASoC: Fix use-after-free at card unregistration

soc_cleanup_card_resources() call snd_card_free() at the last of its
procedure.  This turned out to lead to a use-after-free.
PCM runtimes have been already removed via soc_remove_pcm_runtimes(),
while it's dereferenced later in soc_pcm_free() called via
snd_card_free().

The fix is simple: just move the snd_card_free() call to the beginning
of the whole procedure.  This also gives another benefit: it
guarantees that all operations have been shut down before actually
releasing the resources, which was racy until now.
