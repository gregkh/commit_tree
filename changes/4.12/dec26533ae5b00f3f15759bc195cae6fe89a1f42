qed: Reserve VF feature before PF

Align the driver feature distribution with the flow utilized
by the management firmware - first reserve L2 queues for
VFs and use all the remaining for the PF.

The current distribution might lead to PFs with an enormous
amount of queues, but at the same time leave us with insufficient
resources for starting all VFs.
