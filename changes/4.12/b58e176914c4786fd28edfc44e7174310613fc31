block-mq: don't re-queue if we get a queue error

When try to issue a request directly and we fail we will requeue the
request, but call blk_mq_end_request() as well.  This leads to the
completed request being on a queuelist and getting ended twice, which
causes list corruption in schedulers and other shenanigans.
