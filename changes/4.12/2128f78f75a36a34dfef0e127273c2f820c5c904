ALSA: firewire-lib: add a quirk of packet without valid EOH in CIP format

In IEC 61883-1, when two quadlets CIP header is used, the most significant
bit in second CIP header stands. However, packets from units with MOTU
protocol version 3 have a quirk without this flag. Current packet streaming
layer handles this as protocol error.

This commit adds a new enumeration constant for this quirk, to handle MOTU
protocol version 3.
