dm integrity: various small changes and cleanups

Some coding style changes.

Fix a bug that the array test_tag has insufficient size if the digest
size of internal has is bigger than the tag size.

The function __fls is undefined for zero argument, this patch fixes
undefined behavior if the user sets zero interleave_sectors.

Fix the limit of optional arguments to 8.

Don't allocate crypt_data on the stack to avoid a BUG with debug kernel.

Rename all optional argument names to have underscores rather than
dashes.
