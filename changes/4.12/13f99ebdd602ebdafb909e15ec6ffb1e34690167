ALSA: au88x0: avoid theoretical uninitialized access

The latest gcc-7.0.1 snapshot points out that we if nr_ch is zero, we never
initialize some variables:

sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c: In function 'vortex_adb_allocroute':
sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2304:68: error: 'mix[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2305:58: error: 'src[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

I assume this can never happen in practice, but adding a check here doesn't
hurt either and avoids the warning. The code has been unchanged since
the start of git history.
