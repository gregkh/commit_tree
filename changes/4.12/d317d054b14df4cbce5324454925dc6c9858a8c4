staging: ks7010: move check and break to top of loop

Function uses an if statement within a for loop to guard a block of
code. If 'if' statement conditional evaluates to false, loop breaks. The
same logic can be expressed by inverting the conditional and breaking
when new conditional evaluates to true. This allows the subsequent code
to be indented one level less, aiding readability. Reduced indentation
also allows for the code to be laid out more clearly and fixes two
checkpatch warnings.

Invert if statement conditional, break from for loop if new
conditional evaluates to true. Reduce indentation in subsequent code,
fix whitespace issues. Do not change program logic.
