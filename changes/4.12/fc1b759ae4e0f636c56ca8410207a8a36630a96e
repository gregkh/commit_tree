metag/usercopy: Simplify rapf loop fixup corner case

The final fixup in the rapf loops must handle a corner case due to the
intermediate decrementing of the destination pointer before writing the
last element to it again and re-incrementing it. This decrement (and the
associated increment in the fixup code) can be easily avoided by using
SETL/SETD with an offset of -8/-4.
