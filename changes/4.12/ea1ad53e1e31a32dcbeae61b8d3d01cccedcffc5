KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Collection table save/restore

The save path copies the collection entries into guest RAM
at the GPA specified in the BASER register. This obviously
requires the BASER to be set. The last written element is a
dummy collection table entry.

We do not index by collection ID as the collection entry
can fit into 8 bytes while containing the collection ID.

On restore path we re-allocate the collection objects.
