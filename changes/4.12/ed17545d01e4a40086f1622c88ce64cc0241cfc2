GFS2: Allow glocks to be unlocked after withdraw

This bug fixes a regression introduced by patch 0d1c7ae9d8.

The intent of the patch was to stop promoting glocks after a
file system is withdrawn due to a variety of errors, because doing
so results in a BUG(). (You should be able to unmount after a
withdraw rather than having the kernel panic.)

Unfortunately, it also stopped demotions, so glocks could not be
unlocked after withdraw, which means the unmount would hang.

This patch allows function do_xmote to demote locks to an
unlocked state after a withdraw, but not promote them.
