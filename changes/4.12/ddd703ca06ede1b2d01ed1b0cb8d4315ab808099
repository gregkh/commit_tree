powerpc: Add NMI IPI infrastructure

Add a simple NMI IPI system that handles concurrency and reentrancy.

The platform does not have to implement a true non-maskable interrupt,
the default is to simply use the debugger break IPI message. This has
now been co-opted for a general IPI message, and users (debugger and
crash) have been reimplemented on top of the NMI system.
