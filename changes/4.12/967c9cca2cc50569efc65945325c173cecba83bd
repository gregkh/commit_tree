tee: generic TEE subsystem

Initial patch for generic TEE subsystem.
This subsystem provides:
* Registration/un-registration of TEE drivers.
* Shared memory between normal world and secure world.
* Ioctl interface for interaction with user space.
* Sysfs implementation_id of TEE driver

A TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) driver is a driver that interfaces
with a trusted OS running in some secure environment, for example,
TrustZone on ARM cpus, or a separate secure co-processor etc.

The TEE subsystem can serve a TEE driver for a Global Platform compliant
TEE, but it's not limited to only Global Platform TEEs.

This patch builds on other similar implementations trying to solve
the same problem:
* "optee_linuxdriver" by among others
  Jean-michel DELORME<jean-michel.delorme@st.com> and
  Emmanuel MICHEL <emmanuel.michel@st.com>
* "Generic TrustZone Driver" by Javier González <javier@javigon.com>
