MIPS: Separate MAAR V bit into VL and VH for XPA

The MAAR V bit has been renamed VL since another bit called VH is added
at the top of the register when it is extended to 64-bits on a 32-bit
processor with XPA. Rename the V definition, fix the various users, and
add definitions for the VH bit. Also add a definition for the MAARI
Index field.
