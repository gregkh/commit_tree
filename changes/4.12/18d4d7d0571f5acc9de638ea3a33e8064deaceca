blk-mq: Do not invoke queue operations on a dead queue

In commit e869b5462f83 ("blk-mq: Unregister debugfs attributes
earlier"), we shuffled the debugfs cleanup around so that the "state"
attribute was removed before we freed the blk-mq data structures.
However, later changes are going to undo that, so we need to explicitly
disallow running a dead queue.
