perf stat: Issue a HW watchdog disable hint

When using perf stat on an AMD F15h system with the default hw events
attributes, some of the events don't get counted:

 Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':

          0.749208      task-clock (msec)         #    0.001 CPUs utilized

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^

     <not counted>      branch-misses                                                 (0.00%)

The reason is that we have the HW watchdog consuming one PMU counter and
when perf tries to schedule 6 events on 6 counters and some of those
counters are constrained to only a specific subset of PMCs by the
hardware, the event scheduling fails.

So issue a hint to disable the HW watchdog around a perf stat session.

  Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
	perf stat ...
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
