drm/i915: Add selftests for object allocation, phys

The phys object is a rarely used device (only very old machines require
a chunk of physically contiguous pages for a few hardware interactions).
As such, it is not exercised by CI and to combat that we want to add a
test that exercises the phys object on all platforms.

v2: Always set err on error paths and not rely on inheriting the err.
