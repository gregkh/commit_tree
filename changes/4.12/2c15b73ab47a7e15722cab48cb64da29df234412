MAINTAINERS: Update ocrdma module status

Since ocrdma driver is not going to be updated with any
new development activity, except for critical bug fixes
reported by partners or customers, changing the module status
to "Odd Fixes". Also, updating the web page info and the
maintainers email addresses.
