x86/boot/e820: Move the memblock_find_dma_reserve() function and rename it to memblock_set_dma_reserve()

We introduced memblock_find_dma_reserve() in this commit:

   6f2a75369e75 x86, memblock: Use memblock_memory_size()/memblock_free_memory_size() to get correct dma_reserve

But there's several problems with it:

 - The changelog is full of typos and is incomprehensible in general, and
   the comments in the code are not much better either.

 - The function was inexplicably placed into e820.c, while it has very
   little connection to the E820 table: when we call
   memblock_find_dma_reserve() then memblock is already set up and we
   are not using the E820 table anymore.

 - The function is a wrapper around set_dma_reserve(), but changed the 'set'
   name to 'find' - actively misleading about its primary purpose, which is
   still to set the DMA-reserve value.

 - The function is limited to 64-bit systems, but neither the changelog nor
   the comments explain why. The change would appear to be relevant to
   32-bit systems as well, as the ISA DMA zone is the first 16 MB of RAM.

So address some of these problems:

 - Move it into arch/x86/mm/init.c, next to the other zone setup related
   functions.

 - Clean up the code flow and names of local variables a bit.

 - Rename it to memblock_set_dma_reserve()

 - Improve the comments.

No change in functionality. Enabling it for 32-bit systems is left
for a separate patch.
