fs/ufs: Set UFS default maximum bytes per file

This fixes a problem with reading files larger than 2GB from a UFS-2
file system:

    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195721

The incorrect UFS s_maxsize limit became a problem as of commit
c2a9737f45e2 ("vfs,mm: fix a dead loop in truncate_inode_pages_range()")
which started using s_maxbytes to avoid a page index overflow in
do_generic_file_read().

That caused files to be truncated on UFS-2 file systems because the
default maximum file size is 2GB (MAX_NON_LFS) and UFS didn't update it.

Here I simply increase the default to a common value used by other file
systems.
