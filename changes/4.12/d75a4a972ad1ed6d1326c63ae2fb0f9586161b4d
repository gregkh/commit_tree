platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: do not log set_lcd_level() failures in bl_update_status()

Any set_lcd_level() call can fail for one of two reasons: either
requested brightness is outside the allowed range or the ACPI method
used for setting brightness level is not available.  For
bl_update_status(), the first case is handled by backlight core, which
means bl_update_status() will not even be called if requested brightness
is outside the allowed range.  The second case will be logged anyway by
set_lcd_level() itself, so there is no point in generating another
message in bl_update_status().  Remove the superfluous debug message
along with a local variable that is now redundant.
