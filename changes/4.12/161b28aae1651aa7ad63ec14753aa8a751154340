iommu/vt-d: Make sure IOMMUs are off when intel_iommu=off

When booting into a kexec kernel with intel_iommu=off, and
the previous kernel had intel_iommu=on, the IOMMU hardware
is still enabled and gets not disabled by the new kernel.

This causes the boot to fail because DMA is blocked by the
hardware. Disable the IOMMUs when we find it enabled in the
kexec kernel and boot with intel_iommu=off.
