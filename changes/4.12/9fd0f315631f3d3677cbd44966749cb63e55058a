Add uid and cookie bpf helper to cg_skb_func_proto

BPF helper functions get_socket_cookie and get_socket_uid can be
used for network traffic classifications, among others. Expose
them also to programs of type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB. As of
commit 8f917bba0042 ("bpf: pass sk to helper functions") the
required skb->sk function is available at both cgroup bpf ingress
and egress hooks. With these two new helper, cg_skb_func_proto is
effectively the same as sk_filter_func_proto.

Change since V1:
Instead of add the helper to cg_skb_func_proto, redirect the
cg_skb_func_proto to sk_filter_func_proto since all helper function
in sk_filter_func_proto are applicable to cg_skb_func_proto now.
