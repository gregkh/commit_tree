liquidio: refactor interrupt moderation code

Refactor interrupt moderation code for flexibility because parameters are
different for 10G and 25G cards.  Currently parameters (for 10G only) come
from macros compiled-in to the PF and VF drivers; fix it so that parameters
suitable for the card (10G or 25G) come from the NIC firmware via response
to a command.

Also bump up driver version to 1.5.1 to match newer NIC firmware version.
