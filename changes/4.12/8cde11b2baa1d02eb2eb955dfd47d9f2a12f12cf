tty/serdev: add serdev registration interface

Add a new interface for registering a serdev controller and clients, and
a helper function to deregister serdev devices (or a tty device) that
were previously registered using the new interface.

Once every driver currently using the tty_port_register_device() helpers
have been vetted and converted to use the new serdev registration
interface (at least for deregistration), we can move serdev registration
to the current helpers and get rid of the serdev-specific functions.
