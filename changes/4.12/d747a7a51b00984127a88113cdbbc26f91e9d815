tcp: reset sk_rx_dst in tcp_disconnect()

We have to reset the sk->sk_rx_dst when we disconnect a TCP
connection, because otherwise when we re-connect it this
dst reference is simply overridden in tcp_finish_connect().

This fixes a dst leak which leads to a loopback dev refcnt
leak. It is a long-standing bug, Kevin reported a very similar
(if not same) bug before. Thanks to Andrei for providing such
a reliable reproducer which greatly narrows down the problem.

Fixes: 41063e9dd119 ("ipv4: Early TCP socket demux.")
