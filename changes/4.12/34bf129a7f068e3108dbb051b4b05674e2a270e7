fbdev: sti: don't select CONFIG_VT

While working on another build error, I ran into several variations of
this dependency loop:

subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/input/Kconfig:8:	symbol INPUT is selected by VT
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt

For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"

subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
arch/x86/Kconfig:1005:	symbol X86_LOCAL_APIC depends on X86_UP_APIC

subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/iommu/Kconfig:106:	symbol AMD_IOMMU depends on IOMMU_SUPPORT
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/iommu/Kconfig:5:	symbol IOMMU_SUPPORT is selected by DRM_ETNAVIV
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/gpu/drm/etnaviv/Kconfig:2:	symbol DRM_ETNAVIV depends on THERMAL
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/thermal/Kconfig:5:	symbol THERMAL is selected by ACPI_VIDEO
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
drivers/acpi/Kconfig:183:	symbol ACPI_VIDEO is selected by INPUT

This doesn't currently show up as I fixed the 'THERMAL' part of it,
but I noticed that the FB_STI dependency should not be there but
was introduced by slightly incorrect bug-fix patch that tried to
fix a link error.

Instead of selecting 'VT' to make us enter the drivers/video/console
directory at compile-time, it's sufficient to build the
drivers/video/console/sticore.c file by adding its directory
to when CONFIG_FB_STI is enabled. Alternatively, we could move the
sticore code to another directory that is always built when we
have at STI_CONSOLE or FB_STI enabled.
