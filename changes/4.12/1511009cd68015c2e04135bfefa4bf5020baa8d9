net: mpls: Increase max number of labels for lwt encap

Alow users to push down more labels per MPLS encap. Similar to LSR case,
move label array to the end of mpls_iptunnel_encap and allocate based on
the number of labels for the route.

For consistency with the LSR case, re-use the same maximum number of
labels.
