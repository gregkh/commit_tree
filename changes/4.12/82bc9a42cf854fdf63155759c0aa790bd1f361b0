drm/gma500/psb: Actually use VBT mode when it is found

With LVDS we were incorrectly picking the pre-programmed mode instead of
the prefered mode provided by VBT. Make sure we pick the VBT mode if
one is provided. It is likely that the mode read-out code is still wrong
but this patch fixes the immediate problem on most machines.
