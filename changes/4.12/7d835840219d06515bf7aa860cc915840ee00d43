staging: lustre: Remove lustre_eacl.h

The structures and the macros in the header file are not used
anywhere inside the kernel (verified by using grep). The structures
and macros were leftover from the patch
341f1f0affed1c24712f37c95bb654b3b33ab2c6 "staging: lustre: remove
remote client support". Also, removed the include statements for
lustre_eacl.h.
