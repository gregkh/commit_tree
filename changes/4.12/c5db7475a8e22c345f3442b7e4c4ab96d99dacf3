[media] b2c2: constify nxt200x_config structure

Declare nxt200x_config structure as const as it is only passed as
an argument to the function dvb_attach. dvb_attach calls its first
argument on the rest of its arguments. The first argument of
dvb_attach in the changed case is nxt200x_attach and the parameter of
this function to which the object reference is passed is of type
const. So, nxt200x_config structures having this property can be made
const.
