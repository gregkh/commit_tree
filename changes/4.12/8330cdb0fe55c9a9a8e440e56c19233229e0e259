block: Make writeback throttling defaults consistent for SQ devices

When CFQ is used as an elevator, it disables writeback throttling
because they don't play well together. Later when a different elevator
is chosen for the device, writeback throttling doesn't get enabled
again as it should. Make sure CFQ enables writeback throttling (if it
should be enabled by default) when we switch from it to another IO
scheduler.
