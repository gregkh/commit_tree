RDMA/IPoIB: Limit the ipoib_dev_uninit_default scope

ipoib_dev_uninit_default() call is used in ipoib_main.c file only
and it generates the following warning from smatch tool:
	drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_main.c:1593:6: warning:
	symbol 'ipoib_dev_uninit_default' was not declared. Should it
	be static?

so let's declare that function as static.
