drm/vmwgfx: Support topology greater than texture size

Most of the display servers today use a single surface to represent the
entire desktop even if it's stretched across multiple screens.

For vmwgfx with STDU, the maximum surface size is limited to the
maximum texture size on the host.  On a 2D VM, this limits our
ability to support configurations with more than one 4K monitor.

To get past this limitation, we will now allow using a large DMA buf
as the framebuffer, and take care of blitting contents from this DMA buf
to the display buffer.
