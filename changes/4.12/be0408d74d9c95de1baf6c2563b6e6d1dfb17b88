cpufreq: dbx500: add a Kconfig symbol

Moving the cooling code into the cpufreq driver caused a possible build failure
when the cpu_thermal helper code is a loadable module or disabled:

drivers/cpufreq/dbx500-cpufreq.o: In function `dbx500_cpufreq_ready':
dbx500-cpufreq.c:(.text.dbx500_cpufreq_ready+0x4): undefined reference to `cpufreq_cooling_register'

This adds the same dependency that we have in other cpufreq drivers,
forcing the driver to be disabled when we can't possibly link it.
