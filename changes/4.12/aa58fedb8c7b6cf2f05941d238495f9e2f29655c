[media] gspca: konica: add missing endpoint sanity check

Make sure to check the number of endpoints to avoid accessing memory
beyond the endpoint array should a device lack the expected endpoints.

Note that, as far as I can tell, the gspca framework has already made
sure there is at least one endpoint in the current alternate setting so
there should be no risk for a NULL-pointer dereference here.

konica chipset using cams")
