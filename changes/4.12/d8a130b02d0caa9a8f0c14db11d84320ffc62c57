iwlwifi: pcie: apply no-reclaim logic only to group 0

When applying no-reclaim logic to commands other than the group
zero for legacy commands, commands such as 0x1c (TX_CMD in group
0) can't be used in any other group. Fix that by applying this
logic only for group 0 - it's not and should never be needed for
any other groups.
