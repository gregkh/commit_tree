net: move somaxconn init from sysctl code

The default value for somaxconn is set in sysctl_core_net_init(), but this
function is not called when kernel is configured without CONFIG_SYSCTL.

This results in the kernel not being able to accept TCP connections,
because the backlog has zero size. Usually, the user ends up with:
"TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 7. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters."
If SYN cookies are not enabled the connection is rejected.

Before ef547f2ac16 (tcp: remove max_qlen_log), the effects were less
severe, because the backlog was always at least eight slots long.
