xfs: Fix missed holes in SEEK_HOLE implementation

XFS SEEK_HOLE implementation could miss a hole in an unwritten extent as
can be seen by the following command:

xfs_io -c "falloc 0 256k" -c "pwrite 0 56k" -c "pwrite 128k 8k"
       -c "seek -h 0" file
wrote 57344/57344 bytes at offset 0
56 KiB, 14 ops; 0.0000 sec (49.312 MiB/sec and 12623.9856 ops/sec)
wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 131072
8 KiB, 2 ops; 0.0000 sec (70.383 MiB/sec and 18018.0180 ops/sec)
Whence	Result
HOLE	139264

Where we can see that hole at offset 56k was just ignored by SEEK_HOLE
implementation. The bug is in xfs_find_get_desired_pgoff() which does
not properly detect the case when pages are not contiguous.

Fix the problem by properly detecting when found page has larger offset
than expected.
