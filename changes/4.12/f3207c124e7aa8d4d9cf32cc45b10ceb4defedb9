powerpc/mm/slice: Convert slice_mask high slice to a bitmap

In followup patch we want to increase the va range which will result
in us requiring high_slices to have more than 64 bits. To enable this
convert high_slices to bitmap. We keep the number bits same in this patch
and later change that to higher value
