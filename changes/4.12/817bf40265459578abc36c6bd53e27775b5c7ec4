dm: teach dm-targets to use a dax_device + dax_operations

Arrange for dm to lookup the dax services available from member devices.
Update the dax-capable targets, linear and stripe, to route dax
operations to the underlying device. Changes the target-internal
->direct_access() method to more closely align with the dax_operations
->direct_access() calling convention.
