ext4: fix quota charging for shared xattr blocks

ext4_xattr_block_set() calls dquot_alloc_block() to charge for an xattr
block when new references are made. However if dquot_initialize() hasn't
been called on an inode, request for charging is effectively ignored
because ext4_inode_info->i_dquot is not initialized yet.

Add dquot_initialize() to call paths that lead to ext4_xattr_block_set().
