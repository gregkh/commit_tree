GFS2: Temporarily zero i_no_addr when creating a dinode

Before this patch i_no_addr was not initialized until after the
return from allocating its block. That meant the i_no_addr was
temporarily uninitialized storage. Ordinarily that's not a concern,
but if inplace_reserve can't find space, it can call try_rgrp_unlink
which references i_no_addr as a block to avoid. That can result in
unpredictable behavior. More importantly, the trace point in
gfs2_alloc_blocks references ip->i_no_addr before it is set, which
is misleading when reading the kernel traces. This patch makes it
look like the new dinode block was assigned in the name of inode 0
rather than a random inode that's completely unrelated.
