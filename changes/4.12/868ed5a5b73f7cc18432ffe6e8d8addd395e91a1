scsi: sd_zbc: Do not write lock zones for reset

Resetting a zone write pointer is equivalent to discarding sectors:
after a reset, the zone sectors will contain zeros (or the format
pattern). So there is no need for mutual exclusion between a zone reset
and write. Similarly to discard, make it the responsability of the user
to properly synchronize between reset and write (as is done now for
discard and write).
