scsi: advansys: fix uninitialized data access

gcc-7.0.1 now warns about a previously unnoticed access of uninitialized
struct members:

drivers/scsi/advansys.c: In function 'AscMsgOutSDTR':
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:3860:26: error: '*((void *)&sdtr_buf+5)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
         ((ushort)s_buffer[i + 1] << 8) | s_buffer[i]);
                          ^
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:3860:26: error: '*((void *)&sdtr_buf+7)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:3860:26: error: '*((void *)&sdtr_buf+5)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:3860:26: error: '*((void *)&sdtr_buf+7)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The code has existed in this exact form at least since v2.6.12, and the
warning seems correct. This uses named initializers to ensure we
initialize all members of the structure.
