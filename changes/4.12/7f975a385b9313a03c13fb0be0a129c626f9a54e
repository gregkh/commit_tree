ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Use the sig_bits to define dai bps capability

For calculating the HDA DMA format, use the max_bps supported by the
DAI caps instead of fixing it to 32/24. For host DMA the Max bps support
is 32, but in case of link DMA, this depends on the codec capability.
So use the sig_bits to define the bps supported by dai.
