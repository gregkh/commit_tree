tcp: make congestion control optionally skip slow start after idle

Congestion control modules that want full control over congestion
control behavior do not want the cwnd modifications controlled by
the sysctl_tcp_slow_start_after_idle code path.
So skip those code paths for CC modules that use the cong_control()
API.
As an example, those cwnd effects are not desired for the BBR congestion
control algorithm.
