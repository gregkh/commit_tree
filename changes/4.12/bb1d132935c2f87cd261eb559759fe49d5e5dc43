drm/i915/vbt: split out defaults that are set when there is no VBT

The main thing are the DDI ports. If there's a VBT that says there are
no outputs, we should trust that, and not have semi-random
defaults. Unfortunately, the defaults have resulted in some Chromebooks
without VBT to rely on this behaviour, so we split out the defaults for
the missing VBT case.
