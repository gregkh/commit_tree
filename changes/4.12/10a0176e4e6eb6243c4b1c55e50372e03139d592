qede: Update receive statistic once per NAPI

Currently, each time an ingress packet is passed to networking stack
the driver increments a per-queue SW statistic.
As we want to have additional fields in the first cache-line of the
Rx-queue struct, change flow so this statistic would be updated once per
NAPI run. We will later push the statistic to a different cache line.
