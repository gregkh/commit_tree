usb: host: xhci-ring: don't need to clear interrupt pending for MSI enabled hcd

According to xHCI spec Figure 30: Interrupt Throttle Flow Diagram

	If PCI Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI or MSI-X) are enabled,
       	then the assertion of the Interrupt Pending (IP) flag in Figure 30
       	generates a PCI Dword write. The IP flag is automatically cleared
       	by the completion of the PCI write.

the MSI enabled HCs don't need to clear interrupt pending bit, but
hcd->irq = 0 doesn't equal to MSI enabled HCD. At some Dual-role
controller software designs, it sets hcd->irq as 0 to avoid HCD
requesting interrupt, and they want to decide when to call usb_hcd_irq
by software.
