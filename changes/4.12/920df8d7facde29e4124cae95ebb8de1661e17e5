USB: iowarrior: refactor endpoint retrieval

Use the new endpoint helpers to lookup the required interrupt-in
endpoint.

IOWarror56 devices also requires an interrupt-out endpoint, which is
looked up in a second call.

Note that the descriptors are searched in reverse order to avoid any
regressions.
