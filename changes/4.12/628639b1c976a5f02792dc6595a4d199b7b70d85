wil6210: use WMI_DISCONNECT_CMDID upon connect timeout

Upon connect timeout driver invokes _wil6210_disconnect() which iterates
over sta array and disconnects each connected sta. In practice, because
the connection is still ongoing and because cid is not yet allocated,
disconnect is not actually happening. This leaves FW in connecting
state while driver is in disconnected state.
To fix this, upon connect timeout, explicitly send WMI_DISCONNECT_CMDID
to FW to make sure it gets disconnected.
