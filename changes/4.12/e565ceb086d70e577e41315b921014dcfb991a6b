drm/i915: Only preallocate the aliasing GTT to the extents of the global GTT

As the aliasing GTT is only accessed via the global GTT, we will never
use more of it than we expose via the Global GTT and so we only need to
preallocate sufficient space within the ppgtt for the full GTT. Equally,
if the aliasing GTT is smaller than the global GTT, we have a serious
issue and must bail.
