blk-throttle: add hierarchy support for latency target and idle time

For idle time, children's setting should not be bigger than parent's.
For latency target, children's setting should not be smaller than
parent's. The leaf nodes will adjust their settings according to the
hierarchy and compare their IO with the settings and do
upgrade/downgrade. parents nodes don't need to track their IO
latency/idle time.
