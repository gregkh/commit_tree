drm: exynos: Perform initialization/cleanup at probe/remove time

The drm driver .load() operation is prone to race conditions as it
initializes the driver after registering the device nodes. Its usage is
deprecated, inline it in the probe function and call drm_dev_alloc() and
drm_dev_register() explicitly.

For consistency inline the .unload() handler in the remove function as
well.
