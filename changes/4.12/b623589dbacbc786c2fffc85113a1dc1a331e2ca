svcrdma: Eliminate RPCRDMA_SQ_DEPTH_MULT

The Send Queue depth is temporarily reduced to 1 SQE per credit. The
new rdma_rw API does an internal computation, during QP creation, to
increase the depth of the Send Queue to handle RDMA Read and Write
operations.

This change has to come before the NFSD code paths are updated to
use the rdma_rw API. Without this patch, rdma_rw_init_qp() increases
the size of the SQ too much, resulting in memory allocation failures
during QP creation.
