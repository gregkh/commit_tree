drm/i915: Fix forcewake active domain tracking

In commit 003342a50021 ("drm/i915: Keep track of active
forcewake domains in a bitmask") I forgot to adjust the
newly introduce fw_domains_active state across reset.

This caused the assert_forcewakes_inactive to trigger
during suspend and resume if there were user held
forcewakes.

v2: Bitmask checks are required since vfuncs are not
    always present.

v3: Move bitmask tracking to get/put vfunc for simplicity.
