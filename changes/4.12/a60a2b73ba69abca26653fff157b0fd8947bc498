PCI: Export pcie_flr()

Currently we opencode the FLR sequence in lots of place; export a core
helper instead.  We split out the probing for FLR support as all the
non-core callers already know their hardware.

Note that in the new pci_has_flr() function the quirk check has been moved
before the capability check as there is no point in reading the capability
in this case.
