PM / runtime: Fix autosuspend documentation

Update the autosuspend documentation which claimed that the autosuspend
delay is not taken into account when using the non-autosuspend helper
functions, something which is no longer true since commit d66e6db28df3
("PM / Runtime: Respect autosuspend when idle triggers suspend").

This specifically means that drivers must now disable autosuspend before
disabling runtime pm in probe error paths and remove callbacks if
pm_runtime_put_sync was being used to suspend the device before
returning. (If an idle callback can prevent suspend,
pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend must be used instead of pm_runtime_put_sync
as before.)

Also remove the claim that the autosuspend helpers behave "just like
the non-autosuspend counterparts", something which have never really
been true as some of the latter use idle notifications.
