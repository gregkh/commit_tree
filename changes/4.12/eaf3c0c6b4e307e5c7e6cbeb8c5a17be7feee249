qed - VF tunnelling support [VXLAN/GENEVE/GRE]

This patch adds hardware channel APIs support between
VF and PF for tunnelling configuration for the VFs.
According to that configuration VFs can run VXLAN/GENEVE/GRE
tunnels over it with tunnel features offloaded.

Using these APIs VF can also request for UDP ports configuration
to the PF, although PF and it's child VFs share the same port.
