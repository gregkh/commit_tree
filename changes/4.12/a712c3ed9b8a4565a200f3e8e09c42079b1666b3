acpi/arm64: Add memory-mapped timer support in GTDT driver

On platforms booting with ACPI, architected memory-mapped timers'
configuration data is provided by firmware through the ACPI GTDT
static table.

The clocksource architected timer kernel driver requires a firmware
interface to collect timer configuration and configure its driver.
this infrastructure is present for device tree systems, but it is
missing on systems booting with ACPI.

Implement the kernel infrastructure required to parse the static
ACPI GTDT table so that the architected timer clocksource driver can
make use of it on systems booting with ACPI, therefore enabling
the corresponding timers configuration.
