cpufreq: intel_pstate: Use different utilization update callbacks

Notice that some overhead in the utilization update callbacks
registered by intel_pstate in the active mode can be avoided if
those callbacks are tailored to specific configurations of the
driver.  For example, the utilization update callback for the HWP
enabled case only needs to update the average CPU performance
periodically whereas the utilization update callback for the
PID-based algorithm does not need to take IO-wait boosting into
account and so on.

With that in mind, define three utilization update callbacks for
three different use cases: HWP enabled, the CPU load "powersave"
P-state selection algorithm and the PID-based "powersave" P-state
selection algorithm and modify the driver initialization to
choose the callback matching its current configuration.
