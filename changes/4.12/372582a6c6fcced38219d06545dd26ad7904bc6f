KVM: MIPS/TLB: Add VZ TLB management

Add functions for MIPS VZ TLB management to tlb.c.

kvm_vz_host_tlb_inv() will be used for invalidating root TLB entries
after GPA page tables have been modified due to a KVM page fault. It
arranges for a root GPA mapping to be flushed from the TLB, using the
gpa_mm ASID or the current GuestID to do the probe.

kvm_vz_local_flush_roottlb_all_guests() and
kvm_vz_local_flush_guesttlb_all() flush all TLB entries in the
corresponding TLB for guest mappings (GPA->RPA for root TLB with
GuestID, and all entries for guest TLB). They will be used when starting
a new GuestID cycle, when VZ hardware is enabled/disabled, and also when
switching to a guest when the guest TLB contents may be stale or belong
to a different VM.

kvm_vz_guest_tlb_lookup() converts a guest virtual address to a guest
physical address using the guest TLB. This will be used to decode guest
virtual addresses which are sometimes provided by VZ hardware in
CP0_BadVAddr for certain exceptions when the guest physical address is
unavailable.

kvm_vz_save_guesttlb() and kvm_vz_load_guesttlb() will be used to
preserve wired guest VTLB entries while a guest isn't running.
