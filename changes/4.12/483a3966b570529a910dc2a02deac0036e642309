IB/core: Introduce drop flow specification

This flow steering specification identifies flow for drop by the HW.
If user create a flow only with the drop specification,
then all the packets that hit this flow will be dropped, otherwise the HW
will drop only the packets that match the other L2/L3/L4 specifications.
