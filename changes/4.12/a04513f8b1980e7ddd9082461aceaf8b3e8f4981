ALSA: firewire-lib: record cycle count for the first packet

Currently, packet streaming layer passes generated SYT value to data block
processing layer. However, this is not enough in a case that the data block
processing layer generates time stamps by its own ways.

For out-packet stream, the packet streaming layer guarantees 8,000 times
calls of data block processing layers per sec. Therefore, when cycle count
of the first packet is recorded, data block processing layers can calculate
own time stamps with the recorded value.

For the reason, this commit allows packet streaming layer to record the
first cycle count. Each data block processing layer can read the count by
accessing a member of structure for packet streaming layer.
