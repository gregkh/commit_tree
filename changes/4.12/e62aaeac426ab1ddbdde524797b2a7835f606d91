arm64: kdump: provide /proc/vmcore file

Arch-specific functions are added to allow for implementing a crash dump
file interface, /proc/vmcore, which can be viewed as a ELF file.

A user space tool, like kexec-tools, is responsible for allocating
a separate region for the core's ELF header within crash kdump kernel
memory and filling it in when executing kexec_load().

Then, its location will be advertised to crash dump kernel via a new
device-tree property, "linux,elfcorehdr", and crash dump kernel preserves
the region for later use with reserve_elfcorehdr() at boot time.

On crash dump kernel, /proc/vmcore will access the primary kernel's memory
with copy_oldmem_page(), which feeds the data page-by-page by ioremap'ing
it since it does not reside in linear mapping on crash dump kernel.

Meanwhile, elfcorehdr_read() is simple as the region is always mapped.
