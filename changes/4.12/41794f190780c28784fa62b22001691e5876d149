ftrace: Added ftrace_func_mapper for function probe triggers

In order to move the ops to the function probes directly, they need a way to
map function ips to their own data without depending on the infrastructure
of the function probes, as the data field will be going away.

New helper functions are added that are based on the ftrace_hash code.
ftrace_func_mapper functions are there to let the probes map ips to their
data. These can be allocated by the probe ops, and referenced in the
function callbacks.
