vfio: ccw: introduce support for ccw0

Although Linux does not use format-0 channel command words (CCW0)
these are a non-optional part of the platform spec, and for the sake
of platform compliance, and possibly some non-Linux guests, we have
to support CCW0.

Making the kernel execute a format 0 channel program is too much hassle
because we would need to allocate and use memory which can be addressed
by 24 bit physical addresses (because of CCW0.cda). So we implement CCW0
support by translating the channel program into an equivalent CCW1
program instead.

Based upon an orginal patch by Kai Yue Wang.
