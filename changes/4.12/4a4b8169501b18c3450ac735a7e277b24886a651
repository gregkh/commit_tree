cfg80211: Accept multiple RSSI thresholds for CQM

Change the SET CQM command's RSSI threshold attribute to accept any
number of thresholds as a sorted array.  The API should be backwards
compatible so that if one s32 threshold value is passed, the old
mechanism is enabled.  The netlink event generated is the same in both
cases.

cfg80211 handles an arbitrary number of RSSI thresholds but drivers have
to provide a method (set_cqm_rssi_range_config) that configures a range
set by a high and a low value.  Drivers have to call back when the RSSI
goes out of that range and there's no additional event for each time the
range is reconfigured as there was with the current one-threshold API.

This method doesn't have a hysteresis parameter because there's no
benefit to the cfg80211 code from having the hysteresis be handled by
hardware/driver in terms of the number of wakeups.  At the same time
it would likely be less consistent between drivers if offloaded or
done in the drivers.
