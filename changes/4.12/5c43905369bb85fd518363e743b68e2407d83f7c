cpufreq: intel_pstate: Initialize pid_params statically

Notice that both the existing struct cpu_defaults instances in which
PID parameters are actually initialized use the same values of those
parameters, so it is not really necessary to copy them over to
pid_params dynamically.

Instead, initialize pid_params statically with those values and
drop the unused pid_policy member from struct cpu_defaults along
with copy_pid_params() used for initializing it.
