of: device: Fix overflow of coherent_dma_mask

Size of the dma-range is calculated as coherent_dma_mask + 1
and passed to arch_setup_dma_ops further. It overflows when
the coherent_dma_mask is set for full 64 bits 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF,
resulting in size getting passed as 0 wrongly. Fix this by
passsing in max(mask, mask + 1). Note that in this case
when the mask is set to full 64bits, we will be passing the mask
itself to arch_setup_dma_ops instead of the size. The real fix
for this should be to make arch_setup_dma_ops receive the
mask and handle it, to be done in the future.
