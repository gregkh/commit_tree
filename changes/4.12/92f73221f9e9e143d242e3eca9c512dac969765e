netfilter: expect: Make sure the max_expected limit is effective

Because the type of expecting, the member of nf_conn_help, is u8, it
would overflow after reach U8_MAX(255). So it doesn't work when we
configure the max_expected exceeds 255 with expect policy.

Now add the check for max_expected. Return the -EINVAL when it exceeds
the limit.
