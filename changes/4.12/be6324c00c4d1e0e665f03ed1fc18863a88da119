xfs: fix over-copying of getbmap parameters from userspace

In xfs_ioc_getbmap, we should only copy the fields of struct getbmap
from userspace, or else we end up copying random stack contents into the
kernel.  struct getbmap is a strict subset of getbmapx, so a partial
structure copy should work fine.
