scsi: hisi_sas: modify error handling for v2 hw

For error codes which need abort-and-retry, simulate IO timeout and let
SCSI+ATA layers process those errors.

Previously for SSP, we should try to abort the IO in the LLDD and then
pass back to upper layer, but sometimes this would also error. So
Instead of adding special error handling for this scenario in the LLDD,
allow the upper layer to handle completely.

No performance hit is seen by taking this approach.
