mqprio: Change handling of hw u8 to allow for multiple hardware offload modes

This patch is meant to allow for support of multiple hardware offload type
for a single device. There is currently no bounds checking for the hw
member of the mqprio_qopt structure.  This results in us being able to pass
values from 1 to 255 with all being treated the same.  On retreiving the
value it is returned as 1 for anything 1 or greater being set.

With this change we are currently adding limited bounds checking by
defining an enum and using those values to limit the reported hardware
offloads.
