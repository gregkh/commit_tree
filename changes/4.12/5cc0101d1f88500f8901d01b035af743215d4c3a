tpm_tis_spi: Add small delay after last transfer

Testing the implementation with a Raspberry Pi 2 showed that under some
circumstances its SPI master erroneously releases the CS line before the
transfer is complete, i.e. before the end of the last clock. In this case
the TPM ignores the transfer and misses for example the GO command. The
driver is unable to detect this communication problem and will wait for a
command response that is never going to arrive, timing out eventually.

As a workaround, the small delay ensures that the CS line is held long
enough, even with a faulty SPI master. Other SPI masters are not affected,
except for a negligible performance penalty.
