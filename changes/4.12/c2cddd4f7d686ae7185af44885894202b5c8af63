platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: cleanup error labels in fujitsu_init()

Error labels currently used in fujitsu_init() are really hard to follow:
some (fail_laptop) indicate which operation has failed, others
(fail_sysfs_group) indicate where unrolling should start and the rest
(fail_platform_driver) is simply confusing.  Change them to follow the
pattern used throughout the rest of the module, i.e. make every label
indicate the first unrolling operation it leads to.
