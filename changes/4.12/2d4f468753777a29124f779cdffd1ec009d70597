md/r5cache: handle R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH in recovery

This patch adds handling of R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH in journal recovery.
Next patch will add logic that generate R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH on flush
finish.

When R5LOG_PAYLOAD_FLUSH is seen in recovery, pending data and parity
will be dropped from recovery. This will reduce the number of stripes
to replay, and thus accelerate the recovery process.
