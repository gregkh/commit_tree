Btrfs: remove ASSERT in btrfs_truncate_inode_items

After 76b42abbf748 ("Btrfs: fix data loss after truncate when using the
no-holes feature"),

For either NO_HOLES or inline extents, we've set last_size to newsize to
avoid data loss after remount or inode got evicted and read again, thus,
we don't need this check anymore.
