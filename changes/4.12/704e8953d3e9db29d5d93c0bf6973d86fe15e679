PCI/irq: Add pci_request_irq() and pci_free_irq() helpers

These are small wrappers around request_threaded_irq() and free_irq(),
which dynamically allocate space for the device name so that drivers don't
need to keep static buffers for these around.  Additionally it works with
device-relative vector numbers to make the usage easier, and force the
IRQF_SHARED flag on given that it has no runtime overhead and should be
supported by all PCI devices.
