powerpc/powernv: Move CPU-Offline idle state invocation from smp.c to idle.c

Move the piece of code in powernv/smp.c::pnv_smp_cpu_kill_self() which
transitions the CPU to the deepest available platform idle state to a
new function named pnv_cpu_offline() in powernv/idle.c. The rationale
behind this code movement is that the data required to determine the
deepest available platform state resides in powernv/idle.c.
