md: don't return -EAGAIN in md_allow_write for external metadata arrays

This essentially reverts commit b5470dc5fc18 ("md: resolve external
metadata handling deadlock in md_allow_write") with some adjustments.

Since commit 6791875e2e53 ("md: make reconfig_mutex optional for writes
to md sysfs files.") changing array_state to 'active' does not use
mddev_lock() and will not cause a deadlock with md_allow_write(). This
revert simplifies userspace tools that write to sysfs attributes like
"stripe_cache_size" or "consistency_policy" because it removes the need
for special handling for external metadata arrays, checking for EAGAIN
and retrying the write.
