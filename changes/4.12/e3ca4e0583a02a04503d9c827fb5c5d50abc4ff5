net/mlx5e: Fix warnings around parsing of TC pedit actions

The sparse tool emits these correct complaints:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core//en_tc.c:1005:25: warning: cast to restricted __be32
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core//en_tc.c:1007:25: warning: cast to restricted __be16

The value is provided from user-space in network order, but there's
no way for them to realize that, avoid the warnings by casting to the
appropriate type.
