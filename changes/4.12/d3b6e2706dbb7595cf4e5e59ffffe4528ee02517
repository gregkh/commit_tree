ARM: exynos_defconfig: Enable DYNAMIC_DEBUG and get rid of old ext3

DYNAMIC_DEBUG is quite useful for debugging kernels and should not cause
noticeable performance regressions.  It makes the kernel bigger (around 4%)
but this difference should not impact typical developer and reference
usage of this defconfig.

Additionally, remove the EXT3_FS symbol because it is entirely replaced
by EXT4_FS.
