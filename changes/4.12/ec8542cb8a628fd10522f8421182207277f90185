ARM: dts: bcm2835: fix uart0 pinctrl node names

Downstream kernel uses pins 32, 33 as UART0 (PL011) Rx/Tx to communicate with
the Bluetooth chip. So ALT3 of these pins is most likely not CTS/RTS. Change
the node name to reflect that. This matches section 6.2 "Alternative Function
Assignments" in the BCM2835 ARM Peripherals document.

With this change in place, adding

  &uart0 {
	 pinctrl-names = "default";
	 pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_gpio32 &gpclk2_gpio43>;
	 status = "okay";
  };

to bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dts does the right thing on my Raspberry Pi 3.

Pins 30, 31 are CTS/RTS of UART0 in alternate function 3. Rename uart0_gpio30
as well.

While at it, fix a little typo in a nearby comment.
