drm/i915/execlists: Wrap tail pointer after reset tweaking

If the request->wa_tail is 0 (because it landed exactly on the end of
the ringbuffer), when we reconstruct request->tail following a reset we
fill in an illegal value (-8 or 0x001ffff8). As a result, RING_HEAD is
never able to catch up with RING_TAIL and the GPU spins endlessly. If
the ring contains a couple of breadcrumbs, even our hangcheck is unable
to catch the busy-looping as the ACTHD and seqno continually advance.

v2: Move the wrap into a common intel_ring_wrap().
