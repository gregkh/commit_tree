mmc: sdhci: Do not use spin lock in set_ios paths

The spin lock is not necessary in set_ios. Anything that is racing with
changes to the I/O state is already broken. The mmc core already provides
synchronization via "claiming" the host. So remove spin_lock and friends
from sdhci_set_ios and related callbacks.
