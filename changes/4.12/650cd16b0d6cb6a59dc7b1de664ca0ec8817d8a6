staging: ks7010: add parentheses to complex macro

Checkpatch emits ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed
in parentheses. Error may be fixed by adding parentheses around macro
definition, macros are simple arithmetic statement.

Add parentheses around macro definitions. Fix 24 cases of identical
error. Do commented out macros also to save the next developer from
having to add them.
