powerpc/mm/hash: Support 68 bit VA

Inorder to support large effective address range (512TB), we want to
increase the virtual address bits to 68. But we do have platforms like
p4 and p5 that can only do 65 bit VA. We support those platforms by
limiting context bits on them to 16.

The protovsid -> vsid conversion is verified to work with both 65 and 68
bit va values. I also documented the restrictions in a table format as
part of code comments.
