mm: reclaim MADV_FREE pages

When memory pressure is high, we free MADV_FREE pages.  If the pages are
not dirty in pte, the pages could be freed immediately.  Otherwise we
can't reclaim them.  We put the pages back to anonumous LRU list (by
setting SwapBacked flag) and the pages will be reclaimed in normal
swapout way.

We use normal page reclaim policy.  Since MADV_FREE pages are put into
inactive file list, such pages and inactive file pages are reclaimed
according to their age.  This is expected, because we don't want to
reclaim too many MADV_FREE pages before used once pages.

Based on Minchan's original patch
