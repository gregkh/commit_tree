perf/x86/intel/pt: Handle VMX better

Since commit:

  1c5ac21a0e ("perf/x86/intel/pt: Don't die on VMXON")

... PT events depend on re-scheduling to get enabled after a VMX session
has taken place. This is, in particular, a problem for CPU context events,
which don't normally get re-scheduled, unless there is a reason.

This patch changes the VMX handling so that PT event gets re-enabled
when VMX root mode exits.

Also, notify the user when there's a gap in PT data due to VMX root
mode by flagging AUX records as partial.

In combination with vmm_exclusive=0 parameter of the kvm_intel driver,
this will result in trace gaps only for the duration of the guest's
timeslices.
