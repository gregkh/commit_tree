ixgbe: Fix output from ixgbe_dump

I just found that when we had changed the Rx path to check for length
instead of the DD bit we introduced an issue in ixgbe_dump since we were no
longer clearing the status bits.

To correct this I am updating ixgbe_dump to look for the length bits in the
descriptor since that is what we are using in the Rx path.
