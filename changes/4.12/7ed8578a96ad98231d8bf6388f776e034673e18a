dm rq: change ->rq_end_io calling conventions

Instead of returning either a DM_ENDIO_* constant or an error code, add
a new DM_ENDIO_DONE value that means keep errno as is.  This allows us
to easily keep the existing error code in case where we can't push back,
and it also preparares for the new block level status codes with strict
type checking.
