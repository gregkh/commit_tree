KVM: arm/arm64: Don't call map_resources when restoring ITS tables

The only reason we called kvm_vgic_map_resources() when restoring the
ITS tables was because we wanted to have the KVM iodevs registered in
the KVM IO bus framework at the time when the ITS was restored such that
a restored and active device can inject MSIs prior to otherwise calling
kvm_vgic_map_resources() from the first run of a VCPU.

Since we now register the KVM iodevs for the redestributors and ITS as
soon as possible (when setting the base addresses), we no longer need
this call and kvm_vgic_map_resources() is again called only when first
running a VCPU.
