can: peak: move header file to new can common subdir

The CAN-FD IP from PEAK-System runs into several kinds of PC CAN-FD
interfaces. Up to now, only the USB CAN-FD adapters were supported by
the Kernel. In order to prepare the adding of some new non-USB CAN-FD
interfaces, this patch moves - and rename - the IP definitions file
from its private (usb) sub-directory into a - newly created - CAN specific
one.
