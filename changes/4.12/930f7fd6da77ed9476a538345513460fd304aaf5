KVM: mark requests that do not need a wakeup

Some operations must ensure that the guest is not running with stale
data, but if the guest is halted, then the update can wait until another
event happens.  kvm_make_all_requests() currently doesn't wake up, so we
can mark all requests used with it.

First 8 bits were arbitrarily reserved for request numbers.

Most uses of requests have the request type as a constant, so a compiler
will optimize the '&'.

An alternative would be to have an inline function that would return
whether the request needs a wake-up or not, but I like this one better
even though it might produce worse assembly.
