x86/cpu: Drop wp_works_ok member of struct cpuinfo_x86

Remove the wp_works_ok member of struct cpuinfo_x86. It's an
optimization back from Linux v0.99 times where we had no fixup support
yet and did the CR0.WP test via special code in the page fault handler.
The < 0 test was an optimization to not do the special casing for each
NULL ptr access violation but just for the first one doing the WP test.
Today it serves no real purpose as the test no longer needs special code
in the page fault handler and the only call side -- mem_init() -- calls
it just once, anyway. However, Xen pre-initializes it to 1, to skip the
test.

Doing the test again for Xen should be no issue at all, as even the
commit introducing skipping the test (commit d560bc61575e ("x86, xen:
Suppress WP test on Xen")) mentioned it being ban aid only. And, in
fact, testing the patch on Xen showed nothing breaks.

The pre-fixup times are long gone and with the removal of the fallback
handling code in commit a5c2a893dbd4 ("x86, 386 removal: Remove
CONFIG_X86_WP_WORKS_OK") the kernel requires a working CR0.WP anyway.
So just get rid of the "optimization" and do the test unconditionally.
