soc/tegra: Move Tegra flowctrl driver

The flowctrl driver is required for both ARM and ARM64 Tegra devices
and in order to enable support for it for ARM64, move the Tegra flowctrl
driver into drivers/soc/tegra.

By moving the flowctrl driver, tegra_flowctrl_init() is now called by
via an early initcall and to prevent this function from attempting to
mapping IO space for a non-Tegra device, a test for 'soc_is_tegra()'
is also added.
