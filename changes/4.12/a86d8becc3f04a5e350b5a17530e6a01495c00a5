net: dsa: Factor bottom tag receive functions

All DSA tag receive functions do strictly the same thing after they have located
the originating source port from their tag specific protocol:

- push ETH_HLEN bytes
- set pkt_type to PACKET_HOST
- call eth_type_trans()
- bump up counters
- call netif_receive_skb()

Factor all of that into dsa_switch_rcv(). This also makes us return a pointer to
a sk_buff, which makes us symetric with the xmit function.
