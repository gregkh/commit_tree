drm/dp: start a DPCD based DP sink/branch device quirk database

Face the fact, there are Display Port sink and branch devices out there
in the wild that don't follow the Display Port specifications, or they
have bugs, or just otherwise require special treatment. Start a common
quirk database the drivers can query based on the DP device
identification. At least for now, we leave the workarounds for the
drivers to implement as they see fit.

For starters, add a branch device that can't handle full 24-bit main
link Mdiv and Ndiv main link attributes properly. Naturally, the
workaround of reducing main link attributes for all devices ended up in
regressions for other devices. So here we are.

v2: Rebase on DRM DP desc read helpers

v3: Fix the OUI memcmp blunder (Clint)
