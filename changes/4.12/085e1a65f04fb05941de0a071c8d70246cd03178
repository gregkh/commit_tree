rtnetlink: Do not generate notifications for MTU events

Changing MTU on a link currently causes 3 messages to be sent to userspace:

[LINK]11: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1490 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
    link/ether f2:52:5c:6d:21:f3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

[LINK]11: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
    link/ether f2:52:5c:6d:21:f3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

[LINK]11: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
    link/ether f2:52:5c:6d:21:f3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Remove the messages sent for PRE_CHANGE_MTU and CHANGE_MTU netdev events.
