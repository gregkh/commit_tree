fscrypt: Move key structure and constants to uapi

This commit exposes the necessary constants and structures for a
userspace program to pass filesystem encryption keys into the keyring.
The fscrypt_key structure was already part of the kernel ABI, this
change just makes it so programs no longer have to redeclare these
structures (like e4crypt in e2fsprogs currently does).

Note that we do not expose the other FS_*_KEY_SIZE constants as they are
not necessary. Only XTS is supported for contents_encryption_mode, so
currently FS_MAX_KEY_SIZE bytes of key material must always be passed to
the kernel.

This commit also removes __packed from fscrypt_key as it does not
contain any implicit padding and does not refer to an on-disk structure.
