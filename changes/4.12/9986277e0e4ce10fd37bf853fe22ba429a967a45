Btrfs: handle only applicable errors returned by btrfs_get_extent

btrfs_get_extent() never returns NULL pointers, so this code introduces
a static checker warning.

The btrfs_get_extent() is a bit complex, but trust me that it doesn't
return NULLs and also if it did we would trigger the BUG_ON(!em) before
the last return statement.
