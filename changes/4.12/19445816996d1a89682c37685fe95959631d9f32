USB: Revert "cdc-wdm: fix "out-of-sync" due to missing notifications"

This reverts commit 833415a3e781 ("cdc-wdm: fix "out-of-sync" due to
missing notifications")

There have been several reports of wdm_read returning unexpected EIO
errors with QMI devices using the qmi_wwan driver. The reporters
confirm that reverting prevents these errors. I have been unable to
reproduce the bug myself, and have no explanation to offer either. But
reverting is the safe choice here, given that the commit was an
attempt to work around a firmware problem.  Living with a firmware
problem is still better than adding driver bugs.
