ARM: dts: exynos: Add phy-pcie node for pcie to Exynos5440

Add pcie-phy node to phy-exynos-pcie along with some changes to other
nodes:
1. Remove the configuration space from "ranges" property because this
   was the old way of getting it. Preferred is to use "config" reg.

2. Use the reg-names as "elbi" and "config" so the purpose of addresses
   will be easily known.
