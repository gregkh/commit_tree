x86/kvm: virt_xxx memory barriers instead of mandatory barriers

virt_xxx memory barriers are implemented trivially using the low-level
__smp_xxx macros, __smp_xxx is equal to a compiler barrier for strong
TSO memory model, however, mandatory barriers will unconditional add
memory barriers, this patch replaces the rmb() in kvm_steal_clock() by
virt_rmb().
