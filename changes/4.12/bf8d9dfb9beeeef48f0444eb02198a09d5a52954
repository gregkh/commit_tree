be2net: VxLAN offload should be re-enabled when only 1 UDP port is left

We disable VxLAN offload when more than 1 UDP port is added to the driver,
since Skyhawk doesn't support offload with multiple ports. The existing
driver design expects the user to delete all port configurations and create
a configuration with a single UDP port for VxLAN offload to be re-enabled.
Remove this restriction by tracking the ports added and re-enabling offload
when ports get deleted and only 1 port is left.
