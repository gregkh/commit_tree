power: supply: max17042_battery: Add default platform_data fallback data

Some x86 machines use a max17047 fuel-gauge and x86 might be missing
platform_data if not provided by SFI.

This commit adds default platform_data as fallback option so that the
driver can work on boards where no platform_data is provided.

Since not all boards have a thermistor hooked up, set temp_min to 0 and
change the health checks from temp <= temp_min to temp < temp_min to
not trigger on such boards (where temp reads 0).
