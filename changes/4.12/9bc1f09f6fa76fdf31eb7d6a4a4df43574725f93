KVM: async_pf: avoid async pf injection when in guest mode

This is triggered by running both win7 and win2016 on L1 KVM simultaneously,
and then gives stress to memory on L1, I can observed this hang on L1 when
at least ~70% swap area is occupied on L0.

This is due to async pf was injected to L2 which should be injected to L1,
L2 guest starts receiving pagefault w/ bogus %cr2(apf token from the host
actually), and L1 guest starts accumulating tasks stuck in D state in
kvm_async_pf_task_wait() since missing PAGE_READY async_pfs.

This patch fixes the hang by doing async pf when executing L1 guest.
