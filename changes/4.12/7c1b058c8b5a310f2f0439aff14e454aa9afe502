iommu/dma: Handle IOMMU API reserved regions

Now that it's simple to discover the necessary reservations for a given
device/IOMMU combination, let's wire up the appropriate handling. Basic
reserved regions and direct-mapped regions we simply have to carve out
of IOVA space (the IOMMU core having already mapped the latter before
attaching the device). For hardware MSI regions, we also pre-populate
the cookie with matching msi_pages. That way, irqchip drivers which
normally assume MSIs to require mapping at the IOMMU can keep working
without having to special-case their iommu_dma_map_msi_msg() hook, or
indeed be aware at all of quirks preventing the IOMMU from translating
certain addresses.
