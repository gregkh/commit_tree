arm64: allwinner: h5: Remove syslink to shared DTSI

The arm64 H5 and arm H3 SoCs share roughly the same base, and therefore
share a significant part of their device tree.

The approach we took was to add a symlink from the arm64 DTSI to the arm
DTSI.

Now that the arm DT folder is exposed in the include path, we can just use
it and remove our symlink.
