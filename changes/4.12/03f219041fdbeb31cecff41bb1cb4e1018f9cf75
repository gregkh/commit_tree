ceph: check i_nlink while converting a file handle to dentry

Converting a file handle to a dentry can be done call after the inode
unlink.  This means that __fh_to_dentry() requires an extra check to
verify the number of links is not 0.

The issue can be easily reproduced using xfstest generic/426, which does
something like:

    name_to_handle_at(&fh)
    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    unlink()
    open_by_handle_at(&fh)

The call to open_by_handle_at() should fail, as the file doesn't exist
anymore.
