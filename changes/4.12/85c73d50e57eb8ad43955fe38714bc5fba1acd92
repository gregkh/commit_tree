gpio: acpi: Add managed variant of acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios()

Introduce device managed variant of acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() and its
counterpart acpi_dev_remove_driver_gpios().

The functions in most cases are used in driver's ->probe() and
->remove() callbacks, that's why it's useful to have managed variant of
them.
