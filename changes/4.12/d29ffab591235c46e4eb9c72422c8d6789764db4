drm: bridge: vga-dac: Add adi,adv7123 compatible string

The ADV7123 is a transparent VGA DAC. Unlike dumb VGA DACs it can be
controlled through a power save pin, and requires a power supply.
However, on most boards where the device is used neither the power save
signal nor the power supply are controllable.

To avoid developing a separate device-specific driver add an
"adi,adv7123" compatible entry to the dumb-vga-dac driver. This will
allow supporting most ADV7123-based boards easily, while allowing future
development of an adv7123 driver when needed without breaking backward
compatibility.
