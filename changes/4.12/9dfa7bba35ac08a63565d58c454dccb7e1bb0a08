fix race in drivers/char/random.c:get_reg()

get_reg() can be reentered on architectures with prioritized interrupts
(m68k in this case), causing f->reg_index to be incremented after the
range check. Out of bounds memory access past the pt_regs struct results.
This will go mostly undetected unless access is beyond end of memory.

Prevent the race by disabling interrupts in get_reg().

Tested on m68k (Atari Falcon, and ARAnyM emulator).

Kudos to Geert Uytterhoeven for helping to trace this race.
