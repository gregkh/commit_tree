md/linear: improve bio splitting.

linear_make_request() uses fs_bio_set, which is meant for filesystems
to use, and loops, possible allocating  from the same bio set multiple
times.
These behaviors can theoretically cause deadlocks, though as
linear requests are hardly ever split, it is unlikely in practice.

Change to use mddev->bio_set - otherwise unused for linear, and submit
the tail of a split request to generic_make_request() for it to
handle.
