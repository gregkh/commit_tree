thermal: core: Allow orderly_poweroff to be called only once

thermal_zone_device_check --> thermal_zone_device_update -->
handle_thermal_trip --> handle_critical_trips --> orderly_poweroff

The above sequence happens every 250/500 mS based on the configuration.
The orderly_poweroff function is getting called every 250/500 mS.
With a full fledged file system it takes at least 5-10 Seconds to
power off gracefully.

In that period due to the thermal_zone_device_check triggering
periodically the thermal work queues bombard with
orderly_poweroff calls multiple times eventually leading to
failures in gracefully powering off the system.

Make sure that orderly_poweroff is called only once.
