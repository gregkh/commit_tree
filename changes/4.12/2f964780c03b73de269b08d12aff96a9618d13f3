USB: core: replace %p with %pK

Format specifier %p can leak kernel addresses while not valuing the
kptr_restrict system settings. When kptr_restrict is set to (1), kernel
pointers printed using the %pK format specifier will be replaced with
Zeros. Debugging Note : &pK prints only Zeros as address. If you need
actual address information, write 0 to kptr_restrict.

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict

[Found by poking around in a random vendor kernel tree, it would be nice
if someone would actually send these types of patches upstream - gkh]
