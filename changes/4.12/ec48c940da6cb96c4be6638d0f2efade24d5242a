kref: remove WARN_ON for NULL release functions

The kref functions check for NULL release functions.  This WARN_ON seems
rather pointless.  We will eventually release and then just crash
nicely.  It is also somewhat expensive because these functions are
inlined in a lot of places.  Removing the WARN_ONs saves around 2.3k in
this kernel (likely more in others with more drivers)
