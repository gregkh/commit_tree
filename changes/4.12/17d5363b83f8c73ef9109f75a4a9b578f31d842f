scsi: introduce a result field in struct scsi_request

This passes on the scsi_cmnd result field to users of passthrough
requests.  Currently we abuse req->errors for this purpose, but that
field will go away in its current form.

Note that the old IDE code abuses the errors field in very creative
ways and stores all kinds of different values in it.  I didn't dare
to touch this magic, so the abuses are brought forward 1:1.
