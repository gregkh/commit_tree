ARM: dts: dra7: Add updated operating-points-v2 table for cpu

After the ti-cpufreq driver has been added, we can now drop the
operating-points table present in dra7.dtsi for the cpu and add an
operating-points-v2 table with all OPPs available for all silicon
revisions. Also add necessary data for use by ti-cpufreq to selectively
enable the appropriate OPPs at runtime as part of the operating-points
table.

As we now need to define voltage ranges for each OPP, we define the
minimum and maximum voltage to match the ranges possible for AVS class0
voltage as defined by the DRA7/AM57 Data Manual, with the exception of
using a range for OPP_OD based on historical data to ensure that SoCs
from older lots still continue to boot, even though more optimal voltages
are now the standard. Once an AVS Class0 driver is in place it will be
possible for these OPP voltages to be adjusted to any voltage within the
provided range.
