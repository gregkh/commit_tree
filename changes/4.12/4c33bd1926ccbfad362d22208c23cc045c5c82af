IB/SA: Add support to query OPA path records

When the bit 26 of capmask2 field in OPA classport info
query is set, SA will query for OPA path records instead
of querying for IB path records. Note that OPA
path records can only be queried by kernel ULPs.
Userspace clients continue to query IB path records.
