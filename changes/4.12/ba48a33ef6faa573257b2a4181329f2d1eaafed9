f2fs: in prior to issue big discard

Keep issuing big size discard in prior instead of the one with random
size, so that we expect that it will help to:
- be quick to recycle unused large space in flash storage device.
- give a chance for
  a) wait to merge small piece discards into bigger one, or
  b) avoid issuing discards while they have being reallocated by SSR.
