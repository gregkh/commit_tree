powerpc/mm/radix: Optimise tlbiel flush all case

_tlbiel_pid() is called with a ric (Radix Invalidation Control) argument of
either RIC_FLUSH_TLB or RIC_FLUSH_ALL.

RIC_FLUSH_ALL says to invalidate the entire TLB and the Page Walk Cache (PWC).

To flush the whole TLB, we have to iterate over each set (congruence class) of
the TLB. Currently we do that and pass RIC_FLUSH_ALL each time. That is not
incorrect but it means we flush the PWC 128 times, when once would suffice.

Fix it by doing the first flush with the ric value we're passed, and then if it
was RIC_FLUSH_ALL, we downgrade it to RIC_FLUSH_TLB, because we know we have
just flushed the PWC and don't need to do it again.
