mmc: block: Introduce queue semantics

Change from viewing the requests in progress as 'current' and 'previous',
to viewing them as a queue. The current request is allocated to the first
free slot. The presence of incomplete requests is determined from the
count (mq->qcnt) of entries in the queue. Non-read-write requests (i.e.
discards and flushes) are not added to the queue at all and require no
special handling. Also no special handling is needed for the
MMC_BLK_NEW_REQUEST case.

As well as allowing an arbitrarily sized queue, the queue thread function
is significantly simpler.
