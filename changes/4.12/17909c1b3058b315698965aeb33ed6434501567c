ALSA: firewire-motu: add tracepoints for SPH in IEC 61883-1 fashion

Unique protocol is used for MOTU FireWire series. In this protocol,
data block format is not compliant to AM824 in IEC 61883-1/6. Each of
the data block consists of 24 bit data chunks, except for a first
quadlet. The quadlet is used for source packet header (SPH) described
in IEC 61883-1.

The sequence of SPH seems to represent presentation timestamp
corresponding to included data. Developers have experienced that invalid
sequence brings disorder of units in the series.

Unfortunately, current implementation of ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 engine and
firewire-motu driver brings periodical noises to the units at sampling
transmission frequency based on 44.1 kHz. The engine generates the SPH with
even interval and this mechanism seems not to be suitable to the units.
Further work is required for this issue and infrastructure is preferable
to assist the work.

This commit adds tracepoints for the purpose. In the tracepoints, events
are probed to gather the SPHs from each data blocks.
