platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: add mapping for new hotkeys

The T470, X270 emits new hkey events in the 0x1311 - 0x1315 range.
According to the user manual they should launch a user selected
favorite application (star icon, 0x1311), snipping tool (0x1312,
currently ignored), enable/disable bluetooth (0x1314) and open they
keyboard settings (0x1315).

The third nibble (0xf00) is used to differentiate between the original
hotkeys, the adaptive keyboard codes and the new, additional ones.
