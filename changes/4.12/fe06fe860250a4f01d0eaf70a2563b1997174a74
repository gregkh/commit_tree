selftests/powerpc: Fix TM resched DSCR test with some compilers

The tm-resched-dscr test has started failing sometimes, depending on
what compiler it's built with, eg:

  test: tm_resched_dscr
  Check DSCR TM context switch: tm-resched-dscr: tm-resched-dscr.c:76: test_body: Assertion `rv' failed.
  !! child died by signal 6

When it fails we see that the compiler doesn't initialise rv to 1 before
entering the inline asm block. Although that's counter intuitive, it
is allowed because we tell the compiler that the inline asm will write
to rv (using "=r"), meaning the original value is irrelevant.

Marking it as a read/write parameter would presumably work, but it seems
simpler to fix it by setting the initial value of rv in the inline asm.
