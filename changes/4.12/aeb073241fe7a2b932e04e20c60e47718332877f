net: bridge: start hello timer only if device is up

When the transition of NO_STP -> KERNEL_STP was fixed by always calling
mod_timer in br_stp_start, it introduced a new regression which causes
the timer to be armed even when the bridge is down, and since we stop
the timers in its ndo_stop() function, they never get disabled if the
device is destroyed before it's upped.

To reproduce:
$ while :; do ip l add br0 type bridge hello_time 100; brctl stp br0 on;
ip l del br0; done;
