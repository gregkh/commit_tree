clockevents: Make clockevents_config() static

A clockevent device's rate should be configured before or at registration
and changed afterwards through clockevents_update_freq() only.

For the configuration at registration, we already have
clockevents_config_and_register().

Right now, there are no clockevents_config() users outside of the
clockevents core.

To mitigiate the risk of drivers errorneously reconfiguring their rates
through clockevents_config() *after* device registration, make
clockevents_config() static.
