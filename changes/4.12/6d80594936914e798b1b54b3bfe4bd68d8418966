ARM: 8670/1: V7M: Do not corrupt vector table around v7m_invalidate_l1 call

We save/restore registers around v7m_invalidate_l1 to address pointed
by r12, which is vector table, so the first eight entries are
overwritten with a garbage. We already have stack setup at that stage,
so use it to save/restore register.
