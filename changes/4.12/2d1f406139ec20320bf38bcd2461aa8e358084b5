x86/MCE: Export memory_error()

Export the function which checks whether an MCE is a memory error to
other users so that we can reuse the logic. Drop the boot_cpu_data use,
while at it, as mce.cpuvendor already has the CPU vendor in there.

Integrate a piece from a patch from Vishal Verma
<vishal.l.verma@intel.com> to export it for modules (nfit).

The main reason we're exporting it is that the nfit handler
nfit_handle_mce() needs to detect a memory error properly before doing
its recovery actions.
