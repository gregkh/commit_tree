dax: introduce dax_direct_access()

Replace bdev_direct_access() with dax_direct_access() that uses
dax_device and dax_operations instead of a block_device and
block_device_operations for dax. Once all consumers of the old api have
been converted bdev_direct_access() will be deleted.

Given that block device partitioning decisions can cause dax page
alignment constraints to be violated this also introduces the
bdev_dax_pgoff() helper. It handles calculating a logical pgoff relative
to the dax_device and also checks for page alignment.
