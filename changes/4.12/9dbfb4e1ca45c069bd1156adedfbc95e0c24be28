net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: add port priority override op

Add a new operation to disable the DA, SA and VTU priority override.

Setting such limit is not likely to be used soon, so provide a
port_disable_pri_override operation directly. This can be changed later
for port_set_pri_override when we'll need it.

Also remove the now obsolete mv88e6xxx_6320_family helper.
