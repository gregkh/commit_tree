ovl: Use designated initializers

Prepare to mark sensitive kernel structures for randomization by making
sure they're using designated initializers. These were identified during
allyesconfig builds of x86, arm, and arm64, with most initializer fixes
extracted from grsecurity.

For these cases, use { }, which will be zero-filled, instead of
undesignated NULLs.
