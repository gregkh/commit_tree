serial: sh-sci: Fix (AUTO)RTS in sci_init_pins()

If a UART has dedicated RTS/CTS pins, and hardware control flow is
disabled (or AUTORTS is not yet effective), changing any serial port
configuration deasserts RTS, as .set_termios() calls sci_init_pins().

To fix this, consider the current (AUTO)RTS state when (re)initializing
the pins.  Note that for SCIFA/SCIFB, AUTORTS needs explicit
configuration of the RTS# pin function, while (H)SCIF handles this
automatically.
