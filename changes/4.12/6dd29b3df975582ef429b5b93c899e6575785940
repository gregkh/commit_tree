Revert "x86/mm/gup: Switch GUP to the generic get_user_page_fast() implementation"

This reverts commit 2947ba054a4dabbd82848728d765346886050029.

Dan Williams reported dax-pmem kernel warnings with the following signature:

   WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 245 at lib/percpu-refcount.c:155 percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_rcu+0x1f5/0x200
   percpu ref (dax_pmem_percpu_release [dax_pmem]) <= 0 (0) after switching to atomic

... and bisected it to this commit, which suggests possible memory corruption
caused by the x86 fast-GUP conversion.

He also pointed out:

 "
  This is similar to the backtrace when we were not properly handling
  pud faults and was fixed with this commit: 220ced1676c4 "mm: fix
  get_user_pages() vs device-dax pud mappings"

  I've found some missing _devmap checks in the generic
  get_user_pages_fast() path, but this does not fix the regression
  [...]
 "

So given that there are known bugs, and a pretty robust looking bisection
points to this commit suggesting that are unknown bugs in the conversion
as well, revert it for the time being - we'll re-try in v4.13.
