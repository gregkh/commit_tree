USB: gadget: dummy_hcd: fix hub-descriptor removable fields

Flag the first and only port as removable while also leaving the
remaining bits (including the reserved bit zero) unset in accordance
with the specifications:

	"Within a byte, if no port exists for a given location, the bit
	field representing the port characteristics shall be 0."

Also add a comment marking the legacy PortPwrCtrlMask field.
