caif: Add sockaddr length check before accessing sa_family in connect handler

Verify that the caller-provided sockaddr structure is large enough to
contain the sa_family field, before accessing it in the connect()
handler of the AF_CAIF socket. Since the syscall doesn't enforce a minimum
size of the corresponding memory region, very short sockaddrs (zero or one
byte long) result in operating on uninitialized memory while referencing
sa_family.
