brcmfmac: Do not print the firmware version as an error

Using pr_err for things which are not errors is a bad idea. E.g. it
will cause the plymouth bootsplash screen to drop back to the text
console so that the user can see the error, which is not what we
normally want to happen.

Instead add a new brcmf_info macro and use that.
