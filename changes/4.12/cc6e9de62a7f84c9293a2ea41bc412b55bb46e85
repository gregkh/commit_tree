be2net: Fix offload features for Q-in-Q packets

At least some of the be2net cards do not seem to be capabled
of performing checksum offload computions on Q-in-Q packets.
In these case, the recevied checksum on the remote is invalid
and TCP syn packets are dropped.

This patch adds a call to check disbled acceleration features
on Q-in-Q tagged traffic.
