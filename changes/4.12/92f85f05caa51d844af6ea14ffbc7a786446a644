bnx2x: Allow vfs to disable txvlan offload

VF clients are configured as enforced, meaning firmware is validating
the correctness of their ethertype/vid during transmission.
Once txvlan is disabled, VF would start getting SKBs for transmission
here vlan is on the payload - but it'll pass the packet's ethertype
instead of the vid, leading to firmware declaring it as malicious.
