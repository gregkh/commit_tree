IB/hfi1: Clean up on context initialization failure

The error path for context initialization is not consistent. Cleanup all
resources on failure.

Removed unused variable user_event_mask.

Add the _BASE_FAILED bit to the event flags so that a base context can
notify waiting sub contexts that they cannot continue.

Running out of sub contexts is an EBUSY result, not EINVAL.
