usb: musb: dsps: keep VBUS on for host-only mode

Currently VBUS is turned off while a usb device is detached, and turned
on again by the polling routine. This short period VBUS loss prevents
usb modem to switch mode.

VBUS should be constantly on for host-only mode, so this changes the
driver to not turn off VBUS for host-only mode.
