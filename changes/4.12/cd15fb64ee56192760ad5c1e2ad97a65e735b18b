Revert "dm mirror: use all available legs on multiple failures"

This reverts commit 12a7cf5ba6c776a2621d8972c7d42e8d3d959d20.

This commit apparently attempted to fix an issue that didn't really
exist, furthermore: this commit is the source of deadlocks and crashes
seen in multiple cases related to failing the primary mirror dev while
syncing.
