dm integrity: add recovery mode

In recovery mode, we don't:
- replay the journal
- check checksums
- allow writes to the device

This mode can be used as a last resort for data recovery.  The
motivation for recovery mode is that when there is a single error in the
journal, the user should not lose access to the whole device.
