platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Add IdeaPad 310-15IKB to no_hw_rfkill

Like other Lenovo models the IdeaPad 310-15IKB does not have an hw rfkill
switch. This results in hard-blocked radios after boot, resulting in
always blocked radios rendering them unusable.

Add the IdeaPad 310-15IKB to the no_hw_rfkill DMI list and allows using
the built-in radios.
