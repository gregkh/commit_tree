net: ethoc: enable NAPI before poll may be scheduled

ethoc_reset enables device interrupts, ethoc_interrupt may schedule a
NAPI poll before NAPI is enabled in the ethoc_open, which results in
device being unable to send or receive anything until it's closed and
reopened. In case the device is flooded with ingress packets it may be
unable to recover at all.
Move napi_enable above ethoc_reset in the ethoc_open to fix that.
