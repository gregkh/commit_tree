ceph: when seeing write errors on an inode, switch to sync writes

Currently, we don't have a real feedback mechanism in place for when we
start seeing buffered writeback errors. If writeback is failing, there
is nothing that prevents an application from continuing to dirty pages
that aren't being cleaned.

In the event that we're seeing write errors of any sort occur on an
inode, have the callback set a flag to force further writes to be
synchronous. When the next write succeeds, clear the flag to allow
buffered writeback to continue.

Since this is just a hint to the write submission mechanism, we only
take the i_ceph_lock when a lockless check shows that the flag needs to
be changed.
