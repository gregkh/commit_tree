net: break include loop netdevice.h, dsa.h, devlink.h

There is an include loop between netdevice.h, dsa.h, devlink.h because
of NETDEV_ALIGN, making it impossible to use devlink structures in
dsa.h.

Break this loop by taking dsa.h out of netdevice.h, add a forward
declaration of dsa_switch_tree and netdev_set_default_ethtool_ops()
function, which is what netdevice.h requires.

No longer having dsa.h in netdevice.h means the includes in dsa.h no
longer get included. This breaks a few other files which depend on
these includes. Add these directly in the affected file.
