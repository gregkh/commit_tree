PCI: Avoid FLR for Intel 82579 NICs

Per Intel Specification Update 335553-002 (see link below), some 82579
network adapters advertise a Function Level Reset (FLR) capability, but
they can hang when an FLR is triggered.

To reproduce the problem, attach the device to a VM, then detach and try to
attach again.

Add a quirk to prevent the use of FLR on these devices.
