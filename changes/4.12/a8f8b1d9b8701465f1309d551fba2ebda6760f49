drm: Extract drm_file.h

I'm torn on whether drm_minor really should be here or somewhere else.
Maybe with more clarity after untangling drmP.h more this is easier to
decide, for now I've put a FIXME comment right next to it. Right now
we need struct drm_minor for the inline drm_file type helpers, and so
it does kinda make sense to have them here.

Next patch will kerneldoc-ify the entire pile.
