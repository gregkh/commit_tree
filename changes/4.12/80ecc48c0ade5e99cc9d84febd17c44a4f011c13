HID: sony: Print error on failure to active DS3 / Navigation controllers

This patch adds printing when we failed to activate DS3 / Nagivation
controllers and checks the return value for these failures earlier
in sony_input_configured. This paves the way for other configuration
logic for these devices, which we don't want to call if for example
the activation failed.
