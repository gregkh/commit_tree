f2fs: fix multiple f2fs_add_link() having same name for inline dentry

Commit 88c5c13a5027 (f2fs: fix multiple f2fs_add_link() calls having
same name) does not cover the scenario where inline dentry is enabled.
In that case, F2FS_I(dir)->task will be NULL, and __f2fs_add_link will
lookup dentries one more time.

This patch fixes it by moving the assigment of current task to a upper
level to cover both normal and inline dentry.
