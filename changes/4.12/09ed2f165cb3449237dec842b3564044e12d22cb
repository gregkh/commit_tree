Btrfs: add file item tracepoints

While debugging truncate problems, I found that these tracepoints could
help us quickly know what went wrong.

Two sets of tracepoints are created to track regular/prealloc file item
and inline file item respectively, I put inline as a separate one since
what inline file items cares about are way less than the regular one.

This adds four tracepoints:
- btrfs_get_extent_show_fi_regular
- btrfs_get_extent_show_fi_inline
- btrfs_truncate_show_fi_regular
- btrfs_truncate_show_fi_inline
