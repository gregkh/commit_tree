net/mlx5e: Fix min inline value for VF rep SQs

The offending commit only changed the code path for PF/VF, but it
didn't take care of VF representors. As a result, since
params->tx_min_inline_mode for VF representors is kzalloced to 0
(MLX5_INLINE_MODE_NONE), all VF reps SQs were set to that mode.

This actually works on CX5 by default but broke CX4. Fix that by
adding a call to query the min inline mode from the VF rep build up code.
