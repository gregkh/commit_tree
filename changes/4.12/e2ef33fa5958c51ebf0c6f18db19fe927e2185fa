scsi: cxlflash: Improve asynchronous interrupt processing

The method used to decode asynchronous interrupts involves unnecessary loops
to match up bits that are set with corresponding entries in the asynchronous
interrupt information table. This algorithm is wasteful and does not scale
well as new status bits are supported.

As an improvement, use the for_each_set_bit() service to iterate over the
asynchronous status bits and refactor the information table such that it can
be indexed by bit position.
