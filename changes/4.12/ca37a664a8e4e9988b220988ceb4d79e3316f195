IB/mlx4: Change vma from shared to private

Anonymous VMA (->vm_ops == NULL) cannot be shared, otherwise
it would lead to SIGBUS.

Remove the shared flags from the vma after we change it to be
anonymous.

This is easily reproduced by doing modprobe -r while running a
user-space application such as raw_ethernet_bw.
