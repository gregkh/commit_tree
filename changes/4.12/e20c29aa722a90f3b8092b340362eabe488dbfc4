drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: fix input format/encoding from plat_data

The plat_data->input_bus_format and plat_data->input_bus_encoding
are unsigned long and are always >=0, but the value 0 was still
considered as RGB888 for input_bus_format and default color space
for input_bus_encoding in the reworked code.

This patch changes the if statement check for a non-zero value to
either use the default input bus_format and/or bus_encoding for a zero
value and the provided bus_format and/or bus_encoding for a
non zero value.

Thanks to Dan Carpenter for his bug report at [1].

Tested on Amlogic P230 (with CSC enabled for YUV444 to RGB) and Rockchip
RK3288 ACT8846 EVB Board (no CSC involved, direct RGB passthrough).
