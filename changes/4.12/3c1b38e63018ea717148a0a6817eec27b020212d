drm/i915: Remove redundant toggling from the power well sync_hw hooks

Doing an explicit enable/disable in the power well sync_hw hook based on
the power well's reference count is redundant, since by the time these
hooks are called all the power wells are enabled and have a reference.
So remove the redundant toggling.

This is needed by a follow-up patchset that adds power wells which we
can't enable/disable during power domain initialization and so want to
preserve their state until modeset init time.
