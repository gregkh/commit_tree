drm/i915: Immediately process a reset before starting waiting

As we handoff the GPU reset to the waiter, we need to check we don't
miss a wakeup if it has already been sent prior to us starting the wait.

v2: Tweak checking for reset to be clear to the need before sleeping
after changing the task state.
