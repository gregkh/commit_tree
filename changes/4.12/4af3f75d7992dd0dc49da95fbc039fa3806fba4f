lightnvm: allow to init targets on factory mode

Target initialization has two responsibilities: creating the target
partition and instantiating the target. This patch enables to create a
factory partition (e.g., do not trigger recovery on the given target).
This is useful for target development and for being able to restore the
device state at any moment in time without requiring a full-device
erase.
