block: track request size in blk_issue_stat

Currently there is no way to know the request size when the request is
finished. Next patch will need this info. We could add extra field to
record the size, but blk_issue_stat has enough space to record it, so
this patch just overloads blk_issue_stat. With this, we will have 49bits
to track time, which still is very long time.
