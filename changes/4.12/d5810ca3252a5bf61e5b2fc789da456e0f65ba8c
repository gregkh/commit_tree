net: bcmgenet: clear status to reduce spurious interrupts

Since the DMA interrupt status is latched and the DMA servicing can be
polled, it is a good idea to clear the latched status of a DMA interrupt
before performing the service that would be invoked by the interrupt.

This prevents old status from causing spurious interrupts when the
interrupt is unmasked at a later time.
