powerpc/powernv/npu-dma: Add explicit flush when sending an ATSD

NPU2 requires an extra explicit flush to an active GPU PID when
sending address translation shoot downs (ATSDs) to reliably flush the
GPU TLB. This patch adds just such a flush at the end of each sequence
of ATSDs.

We can safely use PID 0 which is always reserved and active on the
GPU. PID 0 is only used for init_mm which will never be a user mm on
the GPU. To enforce this we add a check in pnv_npu2_init_context()
just in case someone tries to use PID 0 on the GPU.
