ixgbe: add XDP support for pass and drop actions

Basic XDP drop support for ixgbe. Uses READ_ONCE/xchg semantics on XDP
programs instead of RCU primitives as suggested by Daniel Borkmann and
Alex Duyck.

v2: fix the build issues seen w/ XDP when page sizes are larger than 4K
    and made minor fixes based on feedback from Jakub Kicinski
