net: dsa: Mock-up driver

This patch adds support for a DSA mock-up driver which essentially does
the following:

- registers/unregisters 4 fixed PHYs to the slave network devices
- uses eth0 (configurable) as the master netdev
- registers the switch as a fixed MDIO device against the fixed MDIO bus
  at address 31
- includes dynamic debug prints for dsa_switch_ops functions that can be
  enabled to get call traces

This is a good way to test modular builds as well as exercise the DSA
APIs without requiring access to real hardware. This does not test the
data-path, although this could be added later on.
