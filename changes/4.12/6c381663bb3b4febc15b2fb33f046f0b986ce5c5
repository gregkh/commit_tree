power: supply: bq24190_charger: Use new extcon_register_notifier_all()

When I submitted the extcon handling I had a patch pending for the
extcon sub-system for extcon_register_notifier to take -1 as cable id
for listening for all type cable events on an extcon with a single
notifier.

In the end it was decided to instead add a new
extcon_register_notifier_all function for this, switch to using this.
