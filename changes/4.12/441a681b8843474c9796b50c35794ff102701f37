phy: rcar-gen3-usb2: fix implementation for runtime PM

This patch fixes an issue that this driver doesn't take care of the runtime
PM. This code assumed that devm_phy_create() called pm_runtime_enable(dev),
but it misunderstood the dev_phy_create()'s specification.
This driver should call its own pm_runtime_enable() before
dev_phy_create().
