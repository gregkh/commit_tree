arm64: Add support for DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS to IOMMU

Add support for allocating physically contiguous DMA buffers on arm64
systems with an IOMMU.  This can be useful when two or more devices
with different memory requirements are involved in buffer sharing.

Note that as this uses the CMA allocator, setting the
DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS attribute has a runtime-dependency on
CONFIG_DMA_CMA, just like on arm32.

For arm64 systems using swiotlb, no changes are needed to support the
allocation of physically contiguous DMA buffers:
  - swiotlb always uses physically contiguous buffers (up to
    IO_TLB_SEGSIZE = 128 pages),
  - arm64's __dma_alloc_coherent() already calls
    dma_alloc_from_contiguous() when CMA is available.
