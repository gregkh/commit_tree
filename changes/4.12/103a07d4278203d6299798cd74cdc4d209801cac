iio: adc: meson-saradc: fix potential crash in meson_sar_adc_clear_fifo

meson_sar_adc_clear_fifo passes a 0 as value-pointer to regmap_read().
In case of the meson-saradc driver this ends up in regmap_mmio_read(),
where the value-pointer is de-referenced unconditionally to assign the
value which was read.
Fix this by passing an actual pointer, even though all we want to do is
to discard the value.

As a side-effect this fixes a sparse warning ("Using plain integer as
NULL pointer") as reported by Paolo Cretaro.
