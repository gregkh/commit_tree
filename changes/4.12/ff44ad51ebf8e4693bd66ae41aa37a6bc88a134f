drm/i915: Move engine->submit_request selection to a vfunc

It turns out that we may want to restore the original
engine->submit_request (and engine->schedule) callbacks from more than
just the guc <-> execlists transition. Move this to a vfunc so we can
have a common interface.

v2: Move initial selection to intel_engines_init_common(), repaint vfunc
with engine->set_default_submission (and a similar colour for the
helper).
