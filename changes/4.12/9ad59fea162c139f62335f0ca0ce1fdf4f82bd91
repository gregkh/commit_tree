drm/etnaviv: submit support for in-fences

Loosely based on commit f0a42bb5423a ("drm/msm: submit support for
in-fences"). Unfortunately, struct drm_etnaviv_gem_submit doesn't have
a flags field yet, so we have to extend the structure and trust that
drm_ioctl will clear the flags for us if an older userspace only submits
part of the struct.
