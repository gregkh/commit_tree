net: Track start of busy loop instead of when it should end

This patch flips the logic we were using to determine if the busy polling
has timed out.  The main motivation for this is that we will need to
support two different possible timeout values in the future and by
recording the start time rather than when we would want to end we can focus
on making the end_time specific to the task be it epoll or socket based
polling.
