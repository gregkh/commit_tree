sd: split sd_setup_discard_cmnd

Split sd_setup_discard_cmnd into one function per provisioning type.  While
this creates some very slight duplication of boilerplate code it keeps the
code modular for additions of new provisioning types, and for reusing the
write same functions for the upcoming scsi implementation of the Write Zeroes
operation.
