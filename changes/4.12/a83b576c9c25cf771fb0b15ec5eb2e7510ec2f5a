block: fix stacked driver stats init and free

If a driver allocates a queue for stacked usage, then it does
not currently get stats allocated. This causes the later init
of, eg, writeback throttling to blow up. Move the init to the
queue allocation instead.

Additionally, allow a NULL callback unregistration. This avoids
having the caller check for that, fixing another oops on
removal of a block device that doesn't have poll stats allocated.
