sock: introduce SO_MEMINFO getsockopt

Allows reading of SK_MEMINFO_VARS via socket option. This way an
application can get all meminfo related information in single socket
option call instead of multiple calls.

Adds helper function, sk_get_meminfo(), and uses that for both
getsockopt and sock_diag_put_meminfo().
