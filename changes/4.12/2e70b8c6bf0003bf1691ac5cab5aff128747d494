drm/i915/execlists: Relax the locked clear_bit(IRQ_EXECLIST)

We only need to care about the ordering of the clearing of the bit with
the uncached CSB read in order to correctly detect a new interrupt
before the read completes. The uncached read itself acts as a full
memory barrier, so we do not need to enforce another in the form of a
locked clear_bit.

v2: Clarify why the split and unlocked test/clear is harmless.
