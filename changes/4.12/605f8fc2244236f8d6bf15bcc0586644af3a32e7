i2c: core: Add new i2c_acpi_new_device helper function

By default the i2c subsys creates an i2c-client for the first I2cSerialBus
resource of an acpi_device, but some acpi_devices have multiple
I2cSerialBus resources and we may want to instantiate i2c-clients for
the others.

This commit adds a new i2c_acpi_new_device function which can be used to
create an i2c-client for any I2cSerialBus resource of an acpi_device.

Note that the other resources may even be on a different i2c bus, so just
retrieving the client address is not enough.

Here is an example DSDT excerpt from such a device:

    Name (_CID, "INT33FE" /* XPOWER Battery Device */)
