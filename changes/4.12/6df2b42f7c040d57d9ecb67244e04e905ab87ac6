usb: musb: tusb6010_omap: Do not reset the other direction's packet size

We have one register for each EP to set the maximum packet size for both
TX and RX.
If for example an RX programming would happen before the previous TX
transfer finishes we would reset the TX packet side.

To fix this issue, only modify the TX or RX part of the register.
