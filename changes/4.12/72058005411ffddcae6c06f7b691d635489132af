dax: add a facility to lookup a dax device by 'host' device name

For the current block_device based filesystem-dax path, we need a way
for it to lookup the dax_device associated with a block_device. Add a
'host' property of a dax_device that can be used for this purpose. It is
a free form string, but for a dax_device associated with a block device
it is the bdev name.

This is a stop-gap until filesystems are able to mount on a dax-inode
directly.
