MAINTAINERS: Add FUTEX SUBSYSTEM

Add a MAINTAINERS block for the FUTEX SUBSYSTEM which includes the core
kernel code, include headers, testing code, and Documentation. Excludes
arch files, and higher level test code.

I added tglx and mingo as M as they have made the tip commits and peterz
and myself as R.
