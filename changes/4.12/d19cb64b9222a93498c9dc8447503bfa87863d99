i40e: separate PF and VSI state flags

Avoid using the same named flags for both vsi->state and pf->state. This
makes code review easier, as it is more likely that future authors will
use the correct state field when checking bits. Previous commits already
found issues with at least one check, and possibly others may be
incorrect.

This reduces confusion as it is more clear what each flag represents,
and which flags are valid for which state field.
