PCI: Implement devm_pci_remap_cfgspace()

The introduction of the pci_remap_cfgspace() interface allows PCI host
controller drivers to map PCI config space through a dedicated kernel
interface. Current PCI host controller drivers use the devm_ioremap_*()
devres interfaces to map PCI configuration space regions so in order to
update them to the new pci_remap_cfgspace() mapping interface a new set of
devres interfaces should be implemented so that PCI host controller drivers
can make use of them.

Introduce two new functions in the PCI kernel layer and Devres
documentation:

- devm_pci_remap_cfgspace()
- devm_pci_remap_cfg_resource()

so that PCI host controller drivers can make use of them to map PCI
configuration space regions.
