netvsc: fix NAPI performance regression

When using NAPI, the single stream performance declined signifcantly
because the poll routine was updating host after every burst
of packets. This excess signalling caused host throttling.

This fix restores the old behavior. Host is only signalled
after the ring has been emptied.
