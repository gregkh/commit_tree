rtnetlink: NUL-terminate IFLA_PHYS_PORT_NAME string

IFLA_PHYS_PORT_NAME is a string attribute, so terminate it with \0.
Otherwise libnl3 fails to validate netlink messages with this attribute.
"ip -detail a" assumes too that the attribute is NUL-terminated when
printing it. It often was, due to padding.

I noticed this as libvirtd failing to start on a system with sfc driver
after upgrading it to Linux 4.11, i.e. when sfc added support for
phys_port_name.
