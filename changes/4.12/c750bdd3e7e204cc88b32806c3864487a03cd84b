drm/i915: Reject HDMI 12bpc if the sink doesn't indicate support

Check that the sink really declared 12bpc support before we enable it.
This should not actually never happen since it's mandatory for HDMI
sinks to support 12bpc if they support any deep color modes. But
reality disagrees with the theory and there are actually sinks in
the wild that violate the spec.

v2: Fix the output_types check
    Update commit message to state that these things are in fact real
