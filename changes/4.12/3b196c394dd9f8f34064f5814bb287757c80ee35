ALSA: firewire-lib: add no-header packet processing

As long as investigating Fireface 400, IEC 61883-1/6 is not applied to
its packet streaming protocol. Remarks of the specific protocol are:
 * Each packet doesn't include CIP headers.
 * 64,0 and 128,0 kHz are supported.
 * The device doesn't necessarily transmit 8,000 packets per second.
 * 0, 1, 2, 3 are used as tag for rx isochronous packets, however 0 is
   used for tx isochronous packets.

On the other hand, there's a common feature. The number of data blocks
transferred in a second is the same as sampling transmission frequency.
Current ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 engine already has a method to calculate it and
this driver can utilize it for rx packets, as well as tx packets.

This commit adds support for the transferring protocol. CIP_NO_HEADERS
flag is newly added. When this flag is set:
 * Both of 0 (without CIP header) and 1 (with CIP header) are used as tag
   to handle incoming isochronous packet.
 * 0 (without CIP header) is used as tag to transfer outgoing isochronous
   packet.
 * Skip CIP header evaluation.
 * Use unique way to calculate the quadlets of isochronous packet payload.

In ALSA PCM interface, 128.0 kHz is not supported, and the ALSA
IEC 61883-1/6 engine doesn't support 64.0 kHz. These modes are dropped.

The sequence of rx packet has a remarkable quirk about tag. This will be
described in later commits.
