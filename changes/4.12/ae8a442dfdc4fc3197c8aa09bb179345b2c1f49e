efi/libstub/arm*: Set default address and size cells values for an empty dtb

In cases where a device tree is not provided (ie ACPI based system), an
empty fdt is generated by efistub.  #address-cells and #size-cells are not
set in the empty fdt, so they default to 1 (4 byte wide).  This can be an
issue on 64-bit systems where values representing addresses, etc may be
8 bytes wide as the default value does not align with the general
requirements for an empty DTB, and is fragile when passed to other agents
as extra care is required to read the entire width of a value.

This issue is observed on Qualcomm Technologies QDF24XX platforms when
kexec-tools inserts 64-bit addresses into the "linux,elfcorehdr" and
"linux,usable-memory-range" properties of the fdt.  When the values are
later consumed, they are truncated to 32-bit.

Setting #address-cells and #size-cells to 2 at creation of the empty fdt
resolves the observed issue, and makes the fdt less fragile.
