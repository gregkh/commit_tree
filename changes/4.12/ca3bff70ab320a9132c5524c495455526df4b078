hwrng: timeriomem - Improve performance for sub-jiffie update periods

Some hardware RNGs provide a single register for obtaining random data.
Instead of signaling when new data is available, the reader must wait a
fixed amount of time between reads for new data to be generated.
timeriomem_rng implements this scheme with the period specified in
platform data or device tree.  While the period is specified in
microseconds, the implementation used a standard timer which has a
minimum delay of 1 jiffie and caused a significant bottleneck for
devices that can update at 1us.  By switching to an hrtimer, 1us periods
now only delay at most 2us per read.
