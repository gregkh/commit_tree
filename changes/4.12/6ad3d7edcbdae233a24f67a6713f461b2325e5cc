ftgmac100: Cleanup tx queue handling

We have a private lock which isn't terribly useful, and we maintain
a "tx_pending" counter for information that's already available
via a trivial arithmetic operation. Then we unconditionaly wake
the queue even when not stopped. Finally our code in tx isn't
really safe vs. a concurrent reclaim. The aspeed chips aren't SMP
today but I prefer the code being right and future proof.

So rip that out and replace it with more "standard" queue handling,
currently with a threshold of 1 queue element, which will be
increased when we implement fragmented sends.
