ath10k: disallow DFS simulation if DFS channel is not enabled

If DFS is not enabled in hostapd (ieee80211h=0) DFS channels shall
not be available for use even though the hardware may have the capability
to support DFS. With this configuration (DFS disabled in hostapd) trying to
bring up ath10k device in DFS channel for AP mode fails and trying to
simulate DFS in ath10k debugfs results in a warning in cfg80211 complaining
invalid channel and this should be avoided in the driver itself rather than
false propogating RADAR detection to mac80211/cfg80211. Fix this by
checking for the first vif 'is_started' state(should work for client mode
as well) as all the vifs shall be configured for the same channel
