xfs: avoid mount-time deadlock in CoW extent recovery

If a malicious user corrupts the refcount btree to cause a cycle between
different levels of the tree, the next mount attempt will deadlock in
the CoW recovery routine while grabbing buffer locks.  We can use the
ability to re-grab a buffer that was previous locked to a transaction to
avoid deadlocks, so do that here.
