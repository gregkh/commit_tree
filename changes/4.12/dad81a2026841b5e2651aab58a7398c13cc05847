srcu: Introduce CLASSIC_SRCU Kconfig option

The TREE_SRCU rewrite is large and a bit on the non-simple side, so
this commit helps reduce risk by allowing the old v4.11 SRCU algorithm
to be selected using a new CLASSIC_SRCU Kconfig option that depends
on RCU_EXPERT.  The default is to use the new TREE_SRCU and TINY_SRCU
algorithms, in order to help get these the testing that they need.
However, if your users do not require the update-side scalability that
is to be provided by TREE_SRCU, select RCU_EXPERT and then CLASSIC_SRCU
to revert back to the old classic SRCU algorithm.
