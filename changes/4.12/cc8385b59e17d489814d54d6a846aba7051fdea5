btrfs: preallocate radix tree node for readahead

We can preallocate the node so insertion does not have to do that under
the lock. The GFP flags for the per-device radix tree are initialized to
 GFP_NOFS & ~__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM
but we can use GFP_KERNEL, same as an allocation above anyway, but also
because readahead is optional and not on any critical writeout path.
