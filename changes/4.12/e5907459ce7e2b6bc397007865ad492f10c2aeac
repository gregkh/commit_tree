tcp: Record Rx hash and NAPI ID in tcp_child_process

While working on some recent busy poll changes we found that child sockets
were being instantiated without NAPI ID being set.  In our first attempt to
fix it, it was suggested that we should just pull programming the NAPI ID
into the function itself since all callers will need to have it set.

In addition to the NAPI ID change I have dropped the code that was
populating the Rx hash since it was actually being populated in
tcp_get_cookie_sock.
