KEYS: sanitize add_key() and keyctl() key payloads

Before returning from add_key() or one of the keyctl() commands that
takes in a key payload, zero the temporary buffer that was allocated to
hold the key payload copied from userspace.  This may contain sensitive
key material that should not be kept around in the slab caches.
