drm/i915: Eliminate per-fw_domain i915 backpointer

Pass along the drm_i915_private pointer from the caller, rather than
looking it up from each fw_domain during fw_domains_get/_put. This
allows us to then eliminate the backpointer, in exchange for a more
complicated unwrapping procedure in the rare
intel_uncore_fw_release_timer().
