rcu: Eliminate flavor scan in rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle()

The rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle() function scans the RCU flavors, checking
that one of them still needs a quiescent state before doing an expensive
atomic operation on the ->dynticks counter.  However, this check reduces
overhead only after a rare race condition, and increases complexity.  This
commit therefore removes the scan and the mechanism enabling the scan.
