powerpc/64s: Remove unnecessary relocation branch from idle handler

The system reset idle handler system_reset_idle_common is relocated, so
relocation is not required to branch to kvm_start_guest. The superfluous
relocation does not result in incorrect code, but it does not compile
outside of exception-64s.S (with fixed section definitions).
