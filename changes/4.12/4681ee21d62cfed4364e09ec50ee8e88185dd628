drm/i915: Do not sync RCU during shrinking

Due to the complex dependencies between workqueues and RCU, which
are not easily detected by lockdep, do not synchronize RCU during
shrinking.

On low-on-memory systems (mem=1G for example), the RCU sync leads
to all system workqueus freezing and unrelated lockdep splats are
displayed according to reports. GIT bisecting done by J. R.
Okajima points to the commit where RCU syncing was extended.

RCU sync gains us very little benefit in real life scenarios
where the amount of memory used by object backing storage is
dominant over the metadata under RCU, so drop it altogether.

 " Yeeeaah, if core could just, go ahead and reclaim RCU
   queues, that'd be great. "
