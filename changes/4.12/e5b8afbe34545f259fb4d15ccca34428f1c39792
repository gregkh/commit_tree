drm: zte: use vblank hooks in struct drm_crtc_funcs

The vblank hooks in struct drm_driver are deprecated and only meant for
legacy drivers.  For modern drivers with DRIVER_MODESET flag, the hooks
in struct drm_crtc_funcs should be used instead.

The functions are moved around to save forward declaration.
