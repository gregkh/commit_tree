s390/uaccess: use sane length for __strncpy_from_user()

The average string that is copied from user space to kernel space is
rather short. E.g. booting a system involves about 50.000
strncpy_from_user() calls where the NULL terminated string has an
average size of 27 bytes.

By default our s390 specific strncpy_from_user() implementation
however copies up to 4096 bytes, which is a waste of cpu cycles and
cache lines. Therefore reduce the default length to L1_CACHE_BYTES
(256 bytes), which also reduces the average execution time of
strncpy_from_user() by 30-40%.

Alternatively we could have switched to the generic
strncpy_from_user() implementation, however it turned out that that
variant would be slower than the now optimized s390 variant.
