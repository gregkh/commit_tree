nbd: handle dead connections

Sometimes we like to upgrade our server without making all of our
clients freak out and reconnect.  This patch provides a way to specify a
dead connection timeout to allow us to pause all requests and wait for
new connections to be opened.  With this in place I can take down the
nbd server for less than the dead connection timeout time and bring it
back up and everything resumes gracefully.
