[media] v4l: vsp1: Prevent multiple streamon race commencing pipeline early

With multiple inputs through the BRU it is feasible for the streams to
race each other at stream-on.

Multiple VIDIOC_STREAMON calls racing each other could have process
N-1 skipping over the pipeline setup section and then start the pipeline
early, if videobuf2 has already enqueued buffers to the driver for
process N but not called the .start_streaming() operation yet

In the case of the video pipelines, this
can present two serious issues.

 1) A null-dereference if the pipe->dl is committed at the same time as
    the vsp1_video_setup_pipeline() is processing

 2) A hardware hang, where a display list is committed without having
    called vsp1_video_setup_pipeline() first

Repair this issue, by ensuring that only the stream which configures the
pipeline is able to start it.
