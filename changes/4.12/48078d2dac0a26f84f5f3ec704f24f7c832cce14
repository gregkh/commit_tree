sparc/ftrace: Fix ftrace graph time measurement

The ftrace function_graph time measurements of a given function is not
accurate according to those recorded by ftrace using the function
filters.  This change pulls the x86_64 fix from 'commit 722b3c746953
("ftrace/graph: Trace function entry before updating index")' into the
sparc specific prepare_ftrace_return which stops ftrace from
counting interrupted tasks in the time measurement.

Example measurements for select_task_rq_fair running "hackbench 100
process 1000":
