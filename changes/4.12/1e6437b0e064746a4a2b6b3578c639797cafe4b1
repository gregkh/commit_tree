drm/i915/gtt: Prefer i915_vm_is_48bit() over macro

If we setup the vm size early, we can use the newly introduced
i915_vm_is_48bit() in majority of callsites wanting to know the vm size.

As we operate either with 3lvl or 4lvl page table structure,
wrap the vm size query inside a function which tells us if
4lvl setup is needed for particular vm, as the following
code uses the function names where level is noted.

v2: use_4lvl (Chris)
