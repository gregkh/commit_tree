i40e: exit ATR mode only when adding TCP/IPv4 filter succeeds

Move ATR exit check after we have sent the TCP/IPv4 filter to the ring
successfully. This avoids an issue where we potentially update the
filter count without actually succeeding in adding the filter. Now, we
only increment the fd_tcp_rule after we've succeeded. Additionally, we
will re-enable ATR mode only after deletion of the filter is actually
posted to the FDIR ring.
