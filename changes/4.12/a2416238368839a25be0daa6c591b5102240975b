ARM: DRA7: hwmod: Fix DCAN1 stuck in transition

Add HWMOD_CLKDM_NOAUTO flag to DCAN1 module.

Without this DCAN1 module remains stuck in transition
after the CAN interface is brought down. This is also suggested
in Errata i893 "DCAN Initialization Sequence".

Add the HWMOD_CLKDM_NOAUTO to DCAN2 module as well
as it is mentioned in Errata i893.
