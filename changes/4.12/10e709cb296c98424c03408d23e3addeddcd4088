drm/amdgpu: fix deadlock of reservation between cs and gpu reset v2

the case could happen when gpu reset:
1. when gpu reset, cs can be continue until sw queue is full, then push job will wait with holding pd reservation.
2. gpu_reset routine will also need pd reservation to restore page table from their shadow.
3. cs is waiting for gpu_reset complete, but gpu reset is waiting for cs releases reservation.

v2: handle amdgpu_cs_submit error path.
