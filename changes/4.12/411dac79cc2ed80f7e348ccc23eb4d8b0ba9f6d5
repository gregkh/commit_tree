MIPS: r2-on-r6-emu: Clear BLTZALL and BGEZALL debugfs counters

Add missing clearing of BLTZALL and BGEZALL emulation counters in
function mipsr2_stats_clear_show().

Previously, it was not possible to reset BLTZALL and BGEZALL
emulation counters - their value remained the same even after
explicit request via debugfs. As far as other related counters
are concerned, they all seem to be properly cleared.

This change affects debugfs operation only, core R2 emulation
functionality is not affected.
