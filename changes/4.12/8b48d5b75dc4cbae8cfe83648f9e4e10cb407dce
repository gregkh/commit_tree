KVM: MIPS/Emulate: De-duplicate MMIO emulation

Refactor MIPS KVM MMIO load/store emulation to reduce code duplication.
Each duplicate differed slightly anyway, and it will simplify adding
64-bit MMIO support for VZ.

kvm_mips_emulate_store() and kvm_mips_emulate_load() can now return
EMULATE_DO_MMIO (as possibly originally intended). We therefore stop
calling either of these from kvm_mips_emulate_inst(), which is now only
used by kvm_trap_emul_handle_cop_unusable() which is picky about return
values.
