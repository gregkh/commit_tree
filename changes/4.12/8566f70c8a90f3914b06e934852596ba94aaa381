rtc: ds1307: support m41t0 variant

The m41t0 variant is very similar to the already supported m41t00
variant, with the notable exception of the oscillator fail bit.
The data sheet notes:

  If the oscillator fail (OF) bit is internally set to a '1,' this
  indicates that the oscillator has either stopped, or was stopped
  for some period of time and can be used to judge the validity of
  the clock and date data.

The bit will get cleared with a regular write of the system time,
so no changes are needed to clear it.
