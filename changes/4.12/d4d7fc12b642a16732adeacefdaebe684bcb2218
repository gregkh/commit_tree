gfs2: Re-enable fallocate for the rindex

Commit 86066914edff2316cbed63aac8a87d5001441a16 "gfs2: Don't support
fallocate on jdata files" removed the ability of gfs2_grow to reserve
space at the end of the rindex, which could prevent a second gfs2_grow
from succeeding if the fs is full. Allow fallocate to work on the rindex
once again.
