crypto: powerpc - Re-enable non-REFLECTed CRCs

When CRC32c was included in the kernel, Anton ripped out
the #ifdefs around reflected polynomials, because CRC32c
is always reflected. However, not all CRCs use reflection
so we'd like to make it optional.

Restore the REFLECT parts from Anton's original CRC32
implementation (https://github.com/antonblanchard/crc32-vpmsum)

That implementation is available under GPLv2+, so we're OK
from a licensing point of view:
https://github.com/antonblanchard/crc32-vpmsum/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT

As CRC32c requires REFLECT, add that #define.
