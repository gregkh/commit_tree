perf lock: Subcommands should include common options

When I use -i option for report subcommand, it doesn't accept it.  We
need add common options using OPT_PARENT macro.

perf lock report -i lock_perf.data
  Error: unknown switch `i'

  Usage: perf lock report [<options>]

    -f, --force           don't complain, do it
    -k, --key <acquired>  key for sorting ...
