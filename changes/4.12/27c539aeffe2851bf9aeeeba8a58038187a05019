crypto: algapi - annotate expected branch behavior in crypto_inc()

To prevent unnecessary branching, mark the exit condition of the
primary loop as likely(), given that a carry in a 32-bit counter
occurs very rarely.

On arm64, the resulting code is emitted by GCC as

     9a8:   cmp     w1, #0x3
     9ac:   add     x3, x0, w1, uxtw
     9b0:   b.ls    9e0 <crypto_inc+0x38>
     9b4:   ldr     w2, [x3,#-4]!
     9b8:   rev     w2, w2
     9bc:   add     w2, w2, #0x1
     9c0:   rev     w4, w2
     9c4:   str     w4, [x3]
     9c8:   cbz     w2, 9d0 <crypto_inc+0x28>
     9cc:   ret

where the two remaining branch conditions (one for size < 4 and one for
the carry) are statically predicted as non-taken, resulting in optimal
execution in the vast majority of cases.

Also, replace the open coded alignment test with IS_ALIGNED().
