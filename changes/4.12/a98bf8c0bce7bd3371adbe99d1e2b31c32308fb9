net/smc: guarantee ConnClosed send after shutdown SHUT_WR

State SMC_CLOSED should be reached only, if ConnClosed has been sent to
the peer. If ConnClosed is received from the peer, a socket with
shutdown SHUT_WR done, switches errorneously to state SMC_CLOSED, which
means the peer socket is dangling. The local SMC socket is supposed to
switch to state APPFINCLOSEWAIT to make sure smc_close_final() is called
during socket close.
