net: ipv6: Fix UDP early demux lookup with udp_l3mdev_accept=0

David Ahern reported that 5425077d73e0c ("net: ipv6: Add early demux
handler for UDP unicast") breaks udp_l3mdev_accept=0 since early
demux for IPv6 UDP was doing a generic socket lookup which does not
require an exact match. Fix this by making UDPv6 early demux match
connected sockets only.

v1->v2: Take reference to socket after match as suggested by Eric
v2->v3: Add comment before break
