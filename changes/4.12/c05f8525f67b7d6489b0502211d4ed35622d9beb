blk-mq-sched: make completed_request() callback more useful

Currently, this callback is called right after put_request() and has no
distinguishable purpose. Instead, let's call it before put_request() as
soon as I/O has completed on the request, before we account it in
blk-stat. With this, Kyber can enable stats when it sees a latency
outlier and make sure the outlier gets accounted.
