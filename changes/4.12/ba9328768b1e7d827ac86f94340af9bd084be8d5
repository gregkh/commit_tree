staging: ks7010: fix checkpatch UNNECESSARY_ELSE

Checkpatch emits WARNING: else is not generally useful after a break
or return. Two warnings of this type are emitted for this code block,
in both cases 'else' statements are unnecessary.

Remove unnecessary 'else' statements, reduce indentation in subsequent
code.
