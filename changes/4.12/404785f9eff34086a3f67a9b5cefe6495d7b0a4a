ASoC: es8328: Enabling support for 192k

The master and slave modes don't share the same table for MCLK/LRCLK
ratios. The slaves mode has bigger ratios that allow to use BCLK that
matche sampling frequency of 192khz.

This commit enables this rate only for slave mode, i.e it does not
declare this frequency in sysclk_contraints, resulting to an error in
master mode (not supported CLK).
