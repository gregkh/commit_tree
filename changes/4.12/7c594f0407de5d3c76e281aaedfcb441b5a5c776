scsi: hisi_sas: add softreset function for SATA disk

Add softreset to clear IO after internal abort device for SATA disk.

The SATA error handling for the controller is based on device internal
abort and softreset function.

The controller does not support internal abort for single IO, so we need
to execute internal abort for device.
