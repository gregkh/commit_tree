bridge: start hello_timer when enabling KERNEL_STP in br_stp_start

Since commit 76b91c32dd86 ("bridge: stp: when using userspace stp stop
kernel hello and hold timers"), bridge would not start hello_timer if
stp_enabled is not KERNEL_STP when br_dev_open.

The problem is even if users set stp_enabled with KERNEL_STP later,
the timer will still not be started. It causes that KERNEL_STP can
not really work. Users have to re-ifup the bridge to avoid this.

This patch is to fix it by starting br->hello_timer when enabling
KERNEL_STP in br_stp_start.

As an improvement, it's also to start hello_timer again only when
br->stp_enabled is KERNEL_STP in br_hello_timer_expired, there is
no reason to start the timer again when it's NO_STP.
