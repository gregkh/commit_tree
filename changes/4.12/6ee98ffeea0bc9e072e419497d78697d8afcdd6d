x86/ftrace: Make sure that ftrace trampolines are not RWX

ftrace use module_alloc() to allocate trampoline pages. The mapping of
module_alloc() is RWX, which makes sense as the memory is written to right
after allocation. But nothing makes these pages RO after writing to them.

Add proper set_memory_rw/ro() calls to protect the trampolines after
modification.
