scsi: lpfc: Fix NVMEI's handling of NVMET's PRLI response attributes

Code review of NVMEI's FC_PORT_ROLE_NVME_DISCOVERY looked wrong.

Discussions with storage architecture team clarified NVMEI's audit of
the PRLI response port roles.  Following up discussion with code review
showed a few minor corrections were required - especially in
anticipation of NVME auto discovery.

During PRLI, NVMEI should sent prli_init - which it it does.  NVMET
should send prli_tgt and prli_disc - which it does.  When NVMEI receives
a PRLI Response now, it audits the incoming target bits and stores the
attributes in the corresponding NDLP.  Later, when NVMEI registers the
NVME rport, it uses the stored ndlp attributes to set the rport
port_roles correctly.
