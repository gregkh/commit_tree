ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix headset mic and speaker on Asus X441SA/X441UV

ASUS X441SA and X441UV laptops with ALC3236 (ALC223) codec require
the known fixup (ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MIC) and a different pin value on
pin 0x19 to make the headset mic work.

To make the speaker work, it requires an EAPD verb fixup.
