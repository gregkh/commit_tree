net: phy: Allow splitting MDIO bus/device support from PHYs

Introduce a new configuration symbol: MDIO_DEVICE which allows building
the MDIO devices and bus code, without pulling in the entire Ethernet
PHY library and devices code.

PHYLIB nows select MDIO_DEVICE and the relevant Makefile files are
updated to reflect that.

When MDIO_DEVICE (MDIO bus/device only) is selected, but not PHYLIB, we
have mdio-bus.ko as a loadable module, and it does not have a
module_exit() function because the safety of removing a bus class is
unclear.

When both MDIO_DEVICE and PHYLIB are enabled, we need to assemble
everything into a common loadable module: libphy.ko because of nasty
circular dependencies between phy.c, phy_device.c and mdio_bus.c which
are really tough to untangle.
