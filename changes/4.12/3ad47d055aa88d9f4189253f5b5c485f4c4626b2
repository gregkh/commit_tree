arm64: reduce el2_setup branching

The early el2_setup code is a little convoluted, with two branches where
one would do. This makes the code more painful to read than is
necessary.

We can remove a branch and simplify the logic by moving the early return
in the booted-at-EL1 case earlier in the function. This separates it
from all the setup logic that only makes sense for EL2.
