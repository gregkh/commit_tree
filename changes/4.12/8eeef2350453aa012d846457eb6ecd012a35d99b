netfilter: nf_ct_ext: invoke destroy even when ext is not attached

For NF_NAT_MANIP_SRC, we will insert the ct to the nat_bysource_table,
then remove it from the nat_bysource_table via nat_extend->destroy.

But now, the nat extension is attached on demand, so if the nat extension
is not attached, we will not be notified when the ct is destroyed, i.e.
we may fail to remove ct from the nat_bysource_table.

So just keep it simple, even if the extension is not attached, we will
still invoke the related ext->destroy. And this will also preserve the
flexibility for the future extension.
