include/linux/uaccess.h: remove expensive WARN_ON in pagefault_disabled_dec

pagefault_disabled_dec is frequently used inline, and it has a WARN_ON
for underflow that expands to about 6.5k of extra code.  The warning
doesn't seem to be that useful and worth so much code so remove it.

If it was needed could make it depending on some debug kernel option.

Saves ~6.5k in my kernel
