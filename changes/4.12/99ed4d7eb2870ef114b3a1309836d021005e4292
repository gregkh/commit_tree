drm/atmel-hlcdc: Fix suspend/resume implementation

The current suspend resume implementation is assuming register values are
kept when entering suspend, which is no longer the case with the
suspend-to-RAM on the sama5d2.

While at it, switch to the generic infrastructure to enter suspend mode
(drm_atomic_helper_suspend/resume()).
