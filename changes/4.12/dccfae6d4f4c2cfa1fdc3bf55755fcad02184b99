ACPI / battery: Add a blacklist with PMIC ACPI HIDs with a native battery driver

On some systems we have a native PMIC driver which provides battery
monitoring, while the ACPI battery driver is broken on these systems
due to bad DSDTs or because we do not support the proprietary and
undocumented ACPI opregions these ACPI battery devices rely on
(e.g. BMOP opregion).

This leads to there being 2 battery power_supply-s registed like this:

~$ acpi
Battery 0: Charging, 84%, 00:49:39 until charged
Battery 1: Unknown, 0%, rate information unavailable

Even if the ACPI battery where to function fine (which on systems
where we have a native PMIC driver it often doesn't) we still do not
want to export the same battery to userspace twice.

This commit adds a blacklist with PMIC ACPI HIDs for which we've a
native battery driver and makes the ACPI battery driver not register
itself when a PMIC on this list is present.
