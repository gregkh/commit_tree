f2fs: guard macro variables with braces

Add braces around variables used within macros for those make sense
to do it. Many of the macros in f2fs already do this. What this commit
doesn't do is anything that changes line# as a result of adding braces,
which usually affects the binary via __LINE__.

Confirmed no diff in fs/f2fs/f2fs.ko before/after this commit on x86_64,
to make sure this has no functional change as well as there's been no
unexpected side effect due to callers' arithmetics within the existing
code.
