[media] soc-camera: fix rectangle adjustment in cropping

update_subrect() adjusts the sub-rectangle to be inside a base area.
It checks width and height to not exceed those of the area, then it
checks the low border (left or top) to lie within the area, then the
high border (right or bottom) to lie there too. This latter check has
a bug, which is fixed by this patch.
