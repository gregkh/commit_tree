drm/color: un-inline drm_color_lut_extract()

The function is not that big, but it's also not used for anything
performance critical. Make it a normal function.

As a side effect, this apparently makes sparse smarter about what it's
doing, and gets rid of the warning:

./include/drm/drm_color_mgmt.h:53:28: warning: shift too big (4294967295) for type unsigned long
./include/drm/drm_color_mgmt.h:53:28: warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (8000000000000000 becomes 0)
