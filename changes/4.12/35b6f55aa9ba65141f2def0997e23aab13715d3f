trace/kprobes: Allow return probes with offsets and absolute addresses

Since the kernel includes many non-global functions with same names, we
will need to use offsets from other symbols (typically _text/_stext) or
absolute addresses to place return probes on specific functions. Also,
the core register_kretprobe() API never forbid use of offsets or
absolute addresses with kretprobes.

Allow its use with the trace infrastructure. To distinguish kernels that
support this, update ftrace README to explicitly call this out.
