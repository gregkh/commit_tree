printk: fix double printing with earlycon

If a console was specified by ACPI SPCR table _and_ command line
parameters like "console=ttyAMA0" _and_ "earlycon" were specified,
then log messages appear twice.

The root cause is that the code traverses the list of specified
consoles (the `console_cmdline` array) and stops at the first match.
But it may happen that the same console is referred by the elements
of this array twice:

	pl011,mmio,0x87e024000000,115200 -- from SPCR
	ttyAMA0 -- from command line

but in this case `preferred_console` points to the second entry and
the flag CON_CONSDEV is not set, so bootconsole is not deregistered.

To fix that, introduce an invariant "The last non-braille console
is always the preferred one" on the entries of the console_cmdline
array.  Then traverse it in reverse order to be sure that if
the console is preferred then it will be the first matching entry.
Introduce variable console_cmdline_cnt that keeps the number
of elements of the console_cmdline array (Petr Mladek).  It helps
to get rid of the loop that searches for the end of this array.
