arm64: KVM: Fix decoding of Rt/Rt2 when trapping AArch32 CP accesses

Our 32bit CP14/15 handling inherited some of the ARMv7 code for handling
the trapped system registers, completely missing the fact that the
fields for Rt and Rt2 are now 5 bit wide, and not 4...

Let's fix it, and provide an accessor for the most common Rt case.
