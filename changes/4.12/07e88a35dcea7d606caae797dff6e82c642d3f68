HID: Add quirk driver for NTI USB-SUN adapter

These adapters allow pre-USB Sun keyboards to be connected to USB-only
machines, but include the wrong maximum keycode in their report descriptor,
making most of the keys present on Sun keyboards but not 101-key PC
keyboards nonfunctional.

This patch implements a quirk that overrides the maximum keycode in the
report descriptor.
