ARM: sun8i: sina33: add highest OPP of CPUs

The A33 supports 1.1GHz and 1.2GHz frequencies at 1.32V and the Sinlinx
SinA33 has its cpu-supply property set in the cpu DT node.

Therefore, CPUfreq knows how to handle the regulator in charge of the
CPU and can adjust its voltage to match the OPP.

Add these two CPU frequencies to the CPU OPP table of the Sinlinx
SinA33.
