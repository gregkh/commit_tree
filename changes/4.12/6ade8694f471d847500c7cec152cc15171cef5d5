kvm: Move srcu_struct fields to end of struct kvm

Parallelizing SRCU callback handling will increase the size of
srcu_struct, which will move the kvm structure's kvm_arch field out
of reach of powerpc's current assembly code, which will result in the
following sort of build error:

arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S:617: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000b328 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)

This commit moves the srcu_struct fields in the kvm structure to follow
the kvm_arch field, which will allow powerpc's assembly code to continue
to be able to reach the kvm_arch field.

[ paulmck: Moved this commit to precede SRCU callback parallelization,
  and reworded the commit log into future tense, all in the name of
  bisectability. ]
