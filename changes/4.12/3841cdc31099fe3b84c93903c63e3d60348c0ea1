sched/fair: Fix comments

Historically our periods (or p) argument in PELT denoted the number of
full periods (what is now d2). However recent patches have changed
this to the total decay (previously p+1), leading to a confusing
discrepancy between comments and code.

Try and clarify things by making periods (in code) and p (in comments)
be the same thing (again).
