livepatch: separate enabled and patched states

Once we have a consistency model, patches and their objects will be
enabled and disabled at different times.  For example, when a patch is
disabled, its loaded objects' funcs can remain registered with ftrace
indefinitely until the unpatching operation is complete and they're no
longer in use.

It's less confusing if we give them different names: patches can be
enabled or disabled; objects (and their funcs) can be patched or
unpatched:

- Enabled means that a patch is logically enabled (but not necessarily
  fully applied).

- Patched means that an object's funcs are registered with ftrace and
  added to the klp_ops func stack.

Also, since these states are binary, represent them with booleans
instead of ints.
