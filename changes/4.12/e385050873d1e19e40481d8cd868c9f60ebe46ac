s390/zcrypt: Fix blocking queue device after unbind/bind.

When the association between a queue device and the
driver is released via unbind and later re-associated
the queue device was not operational any more. Reason
was a wrong administration of the card/queue lists
within the ap device driver.

This patch introduces revised card/queue list handling
within the ap device driver: when an ap device is
detected it is initial not added to the card/queue list
any more. With driver probe the card device is added to
the card list/the queue device is added to the queue list
within a card. With driver remove the device is removed
from the card/queue list. Additionally there are some
situations within the ap device live where the lists
need update upon card/queue device release (for example
device hot unplug or suspend/resume).
