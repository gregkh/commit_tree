powerpc/powernv: Require MMU_NOTIFIER to fix NPU build

In the recent commit 1ab66d1fbada ("powerpc/powernv: Introduce address
translation services for Nvlink2") the NPU code gained a dependency on MMU
notifiers.

All our defconfigs have KVM enabled, which selects MMU_NOTIFIER, but if KVM is
not enabled then the build breaks.

Fix it by always selecting MMU_NOTIFIER when we're building powernv.
