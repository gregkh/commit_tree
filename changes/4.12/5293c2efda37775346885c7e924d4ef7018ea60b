futex,rt_mutex: Provide futex specific rt_mutex API

Part of what makes futex_unlock_pi() intricate is that
rt_mutex_futex_unlock() -> rt_mutex_slowunlock() can drop
rt_mutex::wait_lock.

This means it cannot rely on the atomicy of wait_lock, which would be
preferred in order to not rely on hb->lock so much.

The reason rt_mutex_slowunlock() needs to drop wait_lock is because it can
race with the rt_mutex fastpath, however futexes have their own fast path.

Since futexes already have a bunch of separate rt_mutex accessors, complete
that set and implement a rt_mutex variant without fastpath for them.
