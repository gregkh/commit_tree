dma-buf: Rename dma-ops to prevent conflict with kunmap_atomic macro

Seeing the kunmap_atomic dma_buf_ops share the same name with a macro
in highmem.h, the former can be aliased if any dma-buf user includes
that header.

I'm personally trying to include highmem.h inside scatterlist.h and this
breaks the dma-buf code proper.

Christoph Hellwig suggested [1] renaming it and pushing this patch ASAP.

To maintain consistency I've renamed all four of kmap* and kunmap* to be
map* and unmap*. (Even though only kmap_atomic presently conflicts.)
