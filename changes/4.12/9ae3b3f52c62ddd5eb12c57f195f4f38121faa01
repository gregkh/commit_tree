block: provide bio_uninit() free freeing integrity/task associations

Wen reports significant memory leaks with DIF and O_DIRECT:

"With nvme devive + T10 enabled, On a system it has 256GB and started
logging /proc/meminfo & /proc/slabinfo for every minute and in an hour
it increased by 15968128 kB or ~15+GB.. Approximately 256 MB / minute
leaking.

/proc/meminfo | grep SUnreclaim...

SUnreclaim:      6752128 kB
SUnreclaim:      6874880 kB
SUnreclaim:      7238080 kB
....
SUnreclaim:     22307264 kB
SUnreclaim:     22485888 kB
SUnreclaim:     22720256 kB

When testcases with T10 enabled call into __blkdev_direct_IO_simple,
code doesn't free memory allocated by bio_integrity_alloc. The patch
fixes the issue. HTX has been run with +60 hours without failure."

Since __blkdev_direct_IO_simple() allocates the bio on the stack, it
doesn't go through the regular bio free. This means that any ancillary
data allocated with the bio through the stack is not freed. Hence, we
can leak the integrity data associated with the bio, if the device is
using DIF/DIX.

Fix this by providing a bio_uninit() and export it, so that we can use
it to free this data. Note that this is a minimal fix for this issue.
Any current user of bio's that are allocated outside of
bio_alloc_bioset() suffers from this issue, most notably some drivers.
We will fix those in a more comprehensive patch for 4.13. This also
means that the commit marked as being fixed by this isn't the real
culprit, it's just the most obvious one out there.
