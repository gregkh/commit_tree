scsi: make eh_eflags persistent

If a failed command is retried and fails again we need
to enter SCSI EH, otherwise we will never be able to
recover the command.
To detect this situation we must not clear scmd->eh_eflags
when EH finishes but rather make it persistent throughout
the lifetime of the command.
