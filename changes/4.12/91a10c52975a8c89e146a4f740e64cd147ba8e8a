xprtrdma: Use same device when mapping or syncing DMA buffers

When the underlying device driver is reloaded, ia->ri_device will be
replaced. All cached copies of that device pointer have to be
updated as well.

Commit 54cbd6b0c6b9 ("xprtrdma: Delay DMA mapping Send and Receive
buffers") added the rg_device field to each regbuf. As part of
handling a device removal, rpcrdma_dma_unmap_regbuf is invoked on
all regbufs for a transport.

Simply calling rpcrdma_dma_map_regbuf for each Receive buffer after
the driver has been reloaded should reinitialize rg_device correctly
for every case except rpcrdma_wc_receive, which still uses
rpcrdma_rep::rr_device.

Ensure the same device that was used to map a Receive buffer is also
used to sync it in rpcrdma_wc_receive by using rg_device there
instead of rr_device.

This is the only use of rr_device, so it can be removed.

The use of regbufs in the send path is also updated, for
completeness.
