i40e/i40evf: Clean-up process_skb_fields

This is a minor clean-up to make the i40e/i40evf process_skb_fields
function look a little more like what we have in igb.  The Rx checksum
function called out a need for skb->protocol but I can't see where it
actually needs it.  I am assuming this is something that was likely
refactored out some time ago as the Rx checksum code has gone through a few
rewrites.
