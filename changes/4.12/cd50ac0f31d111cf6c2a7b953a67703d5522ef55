cfg80211: Fix dfs state propagation for non-DFS center channel

When part of a bigger bandwidth (160 MHz) channel falls in DFS
channel range it is possible that the  center frequency may not
necessarily be a radar channel. Remove the sanity check on channel
flag for IEEE80211_CHAN_RADAR in regulatory_propagate_dfs_state(),
this should fix the dfs state propagation for non-DFS center freq
which has DFS channels in it's bandwidth, should also fix unnecessary
WARN_ON() spam in regulatory_propagate_dfs_state().
