blk-mq: Take tagset lock when updating hw queues

The tagset lock needs to be held when iterating the tag_list, so a
lockdep assert was added when updating number of hardware queues. The
drivers calling this API, however, were unaware of the new requirement,
so are failing the assertion.

This patch takes the lock within the blk-mq function so the drivers do
not have to be modified in order to be safe.

Fixes: 705cda97e ("blk-mq: Make it safe to use RCU to iterate over blk_mq_tag_set.tag_list")
