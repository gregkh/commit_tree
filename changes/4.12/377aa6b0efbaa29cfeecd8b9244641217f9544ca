powerpc/npu-dma: Remove spurious WARN_ON when a PCI device has no of_node

Commit 4c3b89effc28 ("powerpc/powernv: Add sanity checks to
pnv_pci_get_{gpu|npu}_dev") introduced explicit warnings in
pnv_pci_get_npu_dev() when a PCIe device has no associated device-tree
node. However not all PCIe devices have an of_node and
pnv_pci_get_npu_dev() gets indirectly called at least once for every
PCIe device in the system. This results in spurious WARN_ON()'s so
remove it.

The same situation should not exist for pnv_pci_get_gpu_dev() as any
NPU based PCIe device requires a device-tree node.
