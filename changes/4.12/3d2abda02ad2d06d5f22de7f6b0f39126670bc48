ARM: dts: r7s72100: update sdhi clock bindings

The SDHI controller in the RZ/A1 has 2 clock sources per channel and both
need to be enabled/disabled for proper operation. This fixes the fact that
the define for R7S72100_CLK_SDHI1 was not correct to begin with (typo), and
that all 4 clock sources need to be defined an used.
