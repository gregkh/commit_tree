kbuild: clang: add -no-integrated-as to KBUILD_[AC]FLAGS

The Linux Kernel relies on GCC's acceptance of inline assembly as an
opaque object which will not have any validation performed on the content.
The current behaviour in LLVM is to perform validation of the contents by
means of parsing the input if the MC layer can handle it.

Disable clangs integrated assembler and use the GNU assembler instead.
