perf tools: Add a simple expression parser for JSON

Add a simple expression parser good enough to parse JSON relation
expressions. The parser is implemented using bison.

This is just intended as an simple parser for internal usage in the
event lists, not the beginning of a "perf scripting language"

v2: Use expr__ prefix instead of expr_
    Support multiple free variables for parser

Committer note:

The v2 patch had:

  %define api.pure full

In expr.y, that is a feature introduced in bison 2.7, to have reentrant
parsers, not using global variables, which would make tools/perf stop
building with the bison version shipped in older distros, so Andi
realised that the other parsers (e.g. parse-events.y) were using:

  %pure-parser

Which is present in older versions of bison and fits the bill.

I added:

  CFLAGS_expr-bison.o += -DYYENABLE_NLS=0 -DYYLTYPE_IS_TRIVIAL=0 -w

To finally make it build, copying what was there for pmu-bison.o,
another parser.
