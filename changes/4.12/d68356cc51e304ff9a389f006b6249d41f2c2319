KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Fix nr_pre_bits bitfield extraction

We used to extract PRIbits from the ICH_VT_EL2 which was the upper field
in the register word, so a mask wasn't necessary, but as we switched to
looking at PREbits, which is bits 26 through 28 with the PRIbits field
being potentially non-zero, we really need to mask off the field value,
otherwise fun things may happen.
