cpufreq: intel_pstate: Set HWP sampling interval once

In the HWP enabled case pid_params.sample_rate_ns only needs to be
updated once, because it is global, so do that when setting hwp_active
instead of doing it during the initialization of every CPU.

Moreover, pid_params.sample_rate_ms is never used if HWP is enabled,
so do not update it at all then.
