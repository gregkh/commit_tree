staging: rtl8192e: Remove multiple assignments

This patch removes multiple assignments by factorizing them.
This was done with Coccinelle for the if branch. For the else part
the change was done manually. Braces were also added to the
else part to remove the checkpatch warning, "braces should be
on all arms of if-else statements".
