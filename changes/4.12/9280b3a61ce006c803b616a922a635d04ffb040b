staging: ks7010: fix checkpatch PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT

Checkpatch emits WARNING and CHECK for prototype declarations.

WARNING: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Also prototype parameters wrap more than is necessary.

Tidy up function prototypes. Fix 5 error/warning instances.
