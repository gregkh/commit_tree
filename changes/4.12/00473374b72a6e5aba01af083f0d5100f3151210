ext4: mark superblock writes synchronous for nobarrier mounts

Commit b685d3d65ac7 "block: treat REQ_FUA and REQ_PREFLUSH as
synchronous" removed REQ_SYNC flag from WRITE_FUA implementation.
generic_make_request_checks() however strips REQ_FUA flag from a bio
when the storage doesn't report volatile write cache and thus write
effectively becomes asynchronous which can lead to performance
regressions. This affects superblock writes for ext4. Fix the problem
by marking superblock writes always as synchronous.
