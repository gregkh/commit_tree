powerpc: Make /proc/self/stack always print the current stack

For the current task, the kernel stack would only tell the last time the
process was rescheduled, if ever. Use the current stack pointer for the
current task.

Otherwise, every once in a while, the stacktrace printed when reading
/proc/self/stack would look like the process is running in userspace,
while it's not, which some may consider as a bug.

This is also consistent with some other architectures, like x86 and arm,
at least.
