s390: enable ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT

Deferred struct page initialization works on s390. However it makes
only sense for the fake numa case, since the kthreads that initialize
struct pages are started per node. Without fake numa there is just a
single node and therefore no gain.
However there is no reason to not enable this feature. Therefore
select the config option and enable the feature in all config files.
