powerpc: Consolidate variants of real-mode MMIOs

We have all sort of variants of MMIO accessors for the real mode
instructions. This creates a clean set of accessors based on
Linux normal naming conventions, replacing all occurrences of
the old ones in the tree.

I have purposefully removed the "out/in" variants in favor of
only including __raw variants. Any code using these is already
pretty much hand tuned to operate in a very specific environment.
I've fixed up the 2 users (only one of them actually needed
a barrier in the first place).
