dt-bindings: gemini: augment Gemini bindings to reflect Faraday origin

When we merged the Gemini interrupt controller it was not yet
discovered that this IP block is actually a standard Faraday
Technology interrupt controller.

As the IP block will probably appear in other designs as well,
let's augment the DT bindings to reflect that it is first and
foremost a standard Faraday part with a function name (FTINTC010)
so that people reusing the IP easily find the driver they need.

Sorry for the mistakes due to lack of information.
