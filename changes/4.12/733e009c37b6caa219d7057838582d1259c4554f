[media] Staging: media: radio-bcm2048: remove incorrect __exit markups

Even if bus is not hot-pluggable, devices can be unbound from the
driver via sysfs, so we should not be using __exit annotations on
remove() methods. The only exception is drivers registered with
platform_driver_probe() which specifically disables sysfs bind/unbind
attributes.
