pinctrl: bcm: make use of raw_spinlock variants

The bcm pinctrl drivers currently implement an irq_chip for handling
interrupts; due to how irq_chip handling is done, it's necessary for the
irq_chip methods to be invoked from hardirq context, even on a a
real-time kernel.  Because the spinlock_t type becomes a "sleeping"
spinlock w/ RT kernels, it is not suitable to be used with irq_chips.

A quick audit of the operations under the lock reveal that they do only
minimal, bounded work, and are therefore safe to do under a raw spinlock.
