net: vrf: Set slave's private flag before linking

Allow listeners of the subsequent CHANGEUPPER notification to retrieve
the VRF's table ID by calling l3mdev_fib_table() with the slave netdev.
Without this change, the netdev won't be considered an L3 slave and the
function would return 0.

This is consistent with other master device such as bridge and bond that
set the slave's private flag before linking. It also makes
do_vrf_{add,del}_slave() symmetric.
