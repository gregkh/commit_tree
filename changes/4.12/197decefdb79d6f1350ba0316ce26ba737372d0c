efi/libstub/arm: Don't use TASK_SIZE when randomizing the RT space

As reported by James, Catalin and Mark, commit:

  e69176d68d26 ("ef/libstub/arm/arm64: Randomize the base of the UEFI rt services region")

... results in a crash in the firmware, regardless of whether KASLR
is in effect or not and whether the firmware implements EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL
or not.

Mark has identified the root cause to be the inappropriate use of
TASK_SIZE in the stub, which arm64 defines as:

  #define TASK_SIZE             (test_thread_flag(TIF_32BIT) ? \
                                TASK_SIZE_32 : TASK_SIZE_64)

and testing thread flags at this point results in the dereference of
pointers in uninitialized structures.

So instead, introduce a preprocessor symbol EFI_RT_VIRTUAL_LIMIT and
define it to TASK_SIZE_64 on arm64 and TASK_SIZE on ARM, both of which
are compile time constants. Also, change the 'headroom' variable to
static const to force an error if this might change in the future.
