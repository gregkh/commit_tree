xhci: Fix command ring stop regression in 4.11

In 4.11 TRB completion codes were renamed to match spec.

Completion codes for command ring stopped and endpoint stopped
were mixed, leading to failures while handling a stopped command ring.

Use the correct completion code for command ring stopped events.
