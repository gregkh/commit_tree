KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Add infrastructure for table lookup

Add a generic scan_its_table() helper whose role consists in
scanning a contiguous table located in guest RAM and applying
a callback on each entry. Entries can be handled as linked lists
since the callback may return an id offset to the next entry and
also indicate whether the entry is the last one.

Helper functions also are added to compute the device/event ID
offset to the next DTE/ITE.

compute_next_devid_offset, compute_next_eventid_offset and
scan_table will become static in subsequent patches
