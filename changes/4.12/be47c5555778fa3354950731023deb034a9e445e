qede: Split PF/VF ndos.

PFs and VFs share the same structure of NDOs today,
and the VFs explicitly fails the ndo_xdp() callback stating
it doesn't support XDP.

This results in lots of:

  [qede_xdp:1032(enp131s2)]VFs don't support XDP
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 1426 at net/core/rtnetlink.c:1637 rtnl_dump_ifinfo+0x354/0x3c0
  ...
  Call Trace:
    ? __alloc_skb+0x9b/0x1d0
    netlink_dump+0x122/0x290
    netlink_recvmsg+0x27d/0x430
    sock_recvmsg+0x3d/0x50
  ...

As every dump request for the VF interface info would fail due to
rtnl_xdp_fill() returning an error code.

To resolve this, introduce a subset of the NDOs meant for the VF
in a seperate structure and register that one instead for VFs,
and omit the ndo_xdp initialization.
