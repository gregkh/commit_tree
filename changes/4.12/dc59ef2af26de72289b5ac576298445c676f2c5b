staging: ks7010: fix multi-way decision

Multi-way decision contains two anomalies.

Firstly, a local variable is defined to be the inverse truth variable
of a struct member. This local variable is used as the conditional to
the multi-way decision. This is unnecessary, the same logic can be
expressed using the struct member directly.

Secondly, there are four branches in the multi-way decision, two of
which can never be executed. This is dead code.

Remove unnecessary local variable. Remove two branches of multi-way
decision statement that can never be executed.
