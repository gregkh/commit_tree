drivers/perf: arm_pmu: factor out pmu registration

Currently arm_pmu_device_probe contains probing logic specific to the
platform_device infrastructure, and some logic required to safely
register the PMU with various systems.

This patch factors out the logic relating to the registration of the
PMU. This makes arm_pmu_device_probe a little easier to read, and will
make it easier to reuse the logic for an ACPI-specific probing
mechanism.
