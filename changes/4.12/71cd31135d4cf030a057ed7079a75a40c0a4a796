mm: memcontrol: re-use node VM page state enum

The current duplication is a high-maintenance mess, and it's painful to
add new items or query memcg state from the rest of the VM.

This increases the size of the stat array marginally, but we should aim
to track all these stats on a per-cgroup level anyway.
