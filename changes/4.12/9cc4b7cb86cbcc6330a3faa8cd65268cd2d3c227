brcmfmac: Make skb header writable before use

The driver was making changes to the skb_header without
ensuring it was writable (i.e. uncloned).
This patch also removes some boiler plate header size
checking/adjustment code as that is also handled by the
skb_cow_header function used to make header writable.
