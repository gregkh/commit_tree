tcp: fix access to sk->sk_state in tcp_poll()

avoid direct access to sk->sk_state when tcp_poll() is called on a socket
using active TCP fastopen with deferred connect. Use local variable
'state', which stores the result of sk_state_load(), like it was done in
commit 00fd38d938db ("tcp: ensure proper barriers in lockless contexts").
