powerpc/powernv: Set NAPSTATELOST after recovering paca on P9 DD1

Commit 17ed4c8f81da ("powerpc/powernv: Recover correct PACA on wakeup
from a stop on P9 DD1") promises to set the NAPSTATELOST bit in paca
after recovering the correct paca for the thread waking up from stop1
on DD1, so that the GPRs can be correctly restored on the stop exit
path. However, it loads the value 1 into r3, but stores the value in
r0 into NAPSTATELOST(r13).

Fix this by correctly set the NAPSTATELOST bit in paca after
recovering the paca on POWER9 DD1.
