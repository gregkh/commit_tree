mlxsw: spectrum: Add support for flower matches on VLAN ID, PCP

Introduce MLXSW_AFK_ELEMENT_VID, PCP and declare them in afk_element
infos that contain them.  Use the elements when VLAD ID or priority are
used in the flow.

Also add MLXSW_AFK_ELEMENT_VID, PCP to mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_pattern_ipv4.
Both items are included in mlxsw_sp_afk_element_info_l2_dmac,
resp. _smac, and both MLXSW_AFK_ELEMENT_SMAC and _DMAC are already in
the pattern.
