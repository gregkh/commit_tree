nfsd: Revert "nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3 arguments"

This reverts commit 51f567777799 "nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3
arguments", which breaks support for NFSv3 ACLs.

That patch was actually an earlier draft of a fix for the problem that
was eventually fixed by e6838a29ecb "nfsd: check for oversized NFSv2/v3
arguments".  But somehow I accidentally left this earlier draft in the
branch that was part of my 2.12 pull request.
