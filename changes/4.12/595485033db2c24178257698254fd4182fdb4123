ovl: set the ORIGIN type flag

For directory entries, non zero oe->numlower implies OVL_TYPE_MERGE.
Define a new type flag OVL_TYPE_ORIGIN to indicate that an entry holds a
reference to its lower copy up origin.

For directory entries ORIGIN := MERGE && UPPER. For non-dir entries ORIGIN
means that a lower type dentry has been recently copied up or that we were
able to find the copy up origin from overlay.origin xattr.
