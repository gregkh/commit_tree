samples/bpf: run cleanup routines when receiving SIGTERM

Shahid Habib noticed that when xdp1 was killed from a different console the xdp
program was not cleaned-up properly in the kernel and it continued to forward
traffic.

Most of the applications in samples/bpf cleanup properly, but only when getting
SIGINT.  Since kill defaults to using SIGTERM, add support to cleanup when the
application receives either SIGINT or SIGTERM.
