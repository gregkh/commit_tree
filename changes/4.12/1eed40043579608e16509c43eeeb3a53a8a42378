MIPS: smp-mt: Use CPU interrupt controller IPI IRQ domain support

Remove the smp-mt IPI code that supported single-core multithreaded
systems and instead make use of the IPI IRQ domain support provided by
the MIPS CPU interrupt controller driver. This removes some less than
nice code, the horrible split between arch & board code and the
duplication that led to within board code.

The lantiq portion of this patch has only been compile tested. Malta has
been tested & is functional.
