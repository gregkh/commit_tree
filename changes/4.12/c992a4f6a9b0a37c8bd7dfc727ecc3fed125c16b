KVM: MIPS: Implement VZ support

Add the main support for the MIPS Virtualization ASE (A.K.A. VZ) to MIPS
KVM. The bulk of this work is in vz.c, with various new state and
definitions elsewhere.

Enough is implemented to be able to run on a minimal VZ core. Further
patches will fill out support for guest features which are optional or
can be disabled.
