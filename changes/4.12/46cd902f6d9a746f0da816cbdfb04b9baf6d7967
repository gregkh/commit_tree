drm/i915: set initialised only when init_context callback is NULL

During execlist_context_deferred_alloc() we presumed that the context is
uninitialised (we only just allocated the state object for it!) and
chose to optimise away the later call to engine->init_context() if
engine->init_context were NULL. This breaks with GVT's contexts that are
marked as pre-initialised to avoid us annoyingly calling
engine->init_context(). The fix is to not override ce->initialised if it
is already true.
