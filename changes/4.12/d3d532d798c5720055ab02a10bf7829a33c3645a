ftrace: Have unregister_ftrace_function_probe_func() return a value

Currently unregister_ftrace_function_probe_func() is a void function. It
does not give any feedback if an error occurred or no item was found to
remove and nothing was done.

Change it to return status and success if it removed something. Also update
the callers to return that feedback to the user.
