efi/arm-stub: Round up FDT allocation to mapping size

The FDT is mapped via a fixmap entry that is at least 2 MB in size and
2 MB aligned on 4 KB page size kernels.

On UEFI systems, the FDT allocation may share this 2 MB mapping with a
reserved region (or another memory region that we should never map),
unless we account for this in the size of the allocation (the alignment
is already 2 MB)

So instead of taking guesses at the needed space, simply allocate 2 MB
immediately. The allocation will be recorded as EFI_LOADER_DATA, and the
kernel only memblock_reserve()'s the actual size of the FDT, so the
unused space will be released back to the kernel.
