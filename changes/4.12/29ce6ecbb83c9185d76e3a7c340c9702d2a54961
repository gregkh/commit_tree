cfg80211: unify cfg80211_roamed() and cfg80211_roamed_bss()

cfg80211_roamed() and cfg80211_roamed_bss() take the same arguments
except that cfg80211_roamed() requires the BSSID and
cfg80211_roamed_bss() requires the bss entry.

Unify the two functions by using a struct for driver initiated
roaming information so that either the BSSID or the bss entry can be
passed as an argument to the unified function.
