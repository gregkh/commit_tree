xfs: more do_div cleanups

On some architectures do_div does the pointer compare
trick to make sure that we've sent it an unsigned 64-bit
number.  (Why unsigned?  I don't know.)

Fix up the few places that squawk about this; in
xfs_bmap_wants_extents() we just used a bare int64_t so change
that to unsigned.

In xfs_adjust_extent_unmap_boundaries() all we wanted was the
mod, and we have an xfs-specific function to handle that w/o
side effects, which includes proper casting for do_div.

In xfs_daddr_to_ag[b]no, we were using the wrong type anyway;
XFS_BB_TO_FSBT returns a block in the filesystem, so use
xfs_rfsblock_t not xfs_daddr_t, and gain the unsignedness
from that type as a bonus.
