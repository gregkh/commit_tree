scsi: ipr: Remove redundant initialization

Removes some code in __ipr_eh_dev_reset which was modifying the ipr_cmd
done function. This should have already been setup at command allocation
time and if its since been changed, it means we are in the ipr_erp*
functions and need to wait for them to complete and don't want to
override that here.
