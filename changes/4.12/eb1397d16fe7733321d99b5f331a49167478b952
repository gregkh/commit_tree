staging: rtl8192u: Remove ternary operator

Relational and logical operators evaluate to either true or false.
Lines with ternary operators were found using coccinelle script. In a
few cases using logical && operator would suffice. Hence those were
changed to improve readability.

Coccinelle Script:
@r@
expression A,B;
symbol true,false;
binary operator b = {==,!=,&&,||,>=,<=,>,<};
@@
- (A b B) ? true : false
+ A b B
