Input: axp20x-pek - switch to acpi_dev_present and check for ACPI0011 too

acpi_dev_found checks that there is a matching ACPI node, but it
may be disabled (_STA method returns 0) in which case the
soc_button_array driver will not bind to it and axp20x-pek should
handle the power-button.

This commit switches from acpi_dev_found to acpi_dev_present to
avoid not registering an input-dev for the powerbutton when there
is a disabled PNP0C40 device.

The ACPI-6.0 standard defines a standard gpio button device using
the ACPI0011 HID replacing the custom PNP0C40 gpio device, many
newer devices define both PNP0C40 and ACPI0011 devices enabling one
or the other depending on whether the BIOS thinks it is going to boot
Android or Windows.

This commit adds a check for the ACPI0011 device, so that if
either device is present *and* enabled we don't register an input-dev
for the powerbutton.
