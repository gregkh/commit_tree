PCI: Make PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_MASK a 32-bit constant

A 64-bit value is not needed since a PCI ROM address consists in 32 bits.
This fixes a clang warning about "implicit conversion from 'unsigned long'
to 'u32'".

Also remove now unnecessary casts to u32 from __pci_read_base() and
pci_std_update_resource().
