ibmvnic: Cleanup failure path in ibmvnic_open

Now that ibmvnic_release_resources will clean up all of our resources
properly, even if they were not allocated, we can just call this
for failues in ibmvnic_open.

This patch also moves the ibmvnic_release_resources() routine up
in the file to avoid creating a forward declaration ad re-names it to
drop the ibmvnic prefix.
