bpf: pass sk to helper functions

BPF helper functions access socket fields through skb->sk. This is not
set in ingress cgroup and socket filters. The association is only made
in skb_set_owner_r once the filter has accepted the packet. Sk is
available as socket lookup has taken place.

Temporarily set skb->sk to sk in these cases.
