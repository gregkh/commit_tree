staging: ks7010: refactor function call parameters

Function call parameters are split over more lines than
necessary. Also assignment statements are split after the '=' sign.
This adds extra lines to the function and may also reduces
readability.

Refactor function call parameters and reduce the number of lines
used. Put assignment statements onto single line.
