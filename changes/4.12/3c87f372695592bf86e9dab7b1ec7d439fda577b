acpi, nfit: fix acpi_get_table leak

Calls to acpi_get_table() must be paired with acpi_put_table() to undo
the mapping established by acpi_tb_acquire_table().

It turns out this has no effect in practice since the NFIT will already
be mapped to support the /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/NFIT attribute in
sysfs.
