ARM: KVM: Gracefully handle hyp-stubs being restored from under our feet

Should kvm_reboot() be invoked while guest is running, an IPI
wil be issued, forcing the guest to exit and HYP being reset to
the stubs. We will then try to reenter the guest, only to get
an error (HVC_STUB_ERR).

This patch allows this case to be gracefully handled by exiting
the run loop.
