ARM: dts: am33xx: Add updated operating-points-v2 table for cpu

After the ti-cpufreq driver has been added, we can now drop the
operating-points table present in am33xx.dtsi for the cpu and add an
operating-points-v2 table with all OPPs available for all silicon
revisions. Also add necessary data for use by ti-cpufreq to selectively
enable the appropriate OPPs at runtime as part of the operating-points
table.

Information from AM335x Data Manual, SPRS717i, Revised December 2015,
Table 5-7.
