mm: don't assume anonymous pages have SwapBacked flag

There are a few places the code assumes anonymous pages should have
SwapBacked flag set.  MADV_FREE pages are anonymous pages but we are
going to add them to LRU_INACTIVE_FILE list and clear SwapBacked flag
for them.  The assumption doesn't hold any more, so fix them.
