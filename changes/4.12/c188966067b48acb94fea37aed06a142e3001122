speakup: make get_char actually get unicode characters

9831013cbdbd3d06430a1db01d8c32d50c7d1c04 ('speakup: convert screen
reading to 16bit characters') paved the way for handling unicode
characters in speakup, but for the review mode, it missed actually
getting unicode characters from the VC. This fixes by just turning the
use_unicode parameter to 1.
