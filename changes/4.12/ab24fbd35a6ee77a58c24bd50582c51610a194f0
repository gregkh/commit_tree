s390/dasd: suppress command reject error for query host access command

On some z/VM systems the query host access command is not supported for
temp disks, though the corresponding feature code is set.
This does not have any impact beside that the information is not available.
Suppress the full blown command reject error messages to not confuse the
user. The error is still logged in the s390dbf.
