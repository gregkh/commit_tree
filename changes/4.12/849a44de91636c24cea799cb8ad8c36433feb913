net: don't global ICMP rate limit packets originating from loopback

Florian Weimer seems to have a glibc test-case which requires that
loopback interfaces does not get ICMP ratelimited.  This was broken by
commit c0303efeab73 ("net: reduce cycles spend on ICMP replies that
gets rate limited").

An ICMP response will usually be routed back-out the same incoming
interface.  Thus, take advantage of this and skip global ICMP
ratelimit when the incoming device is loopback.  In the unlikely event
that the outgoing it not loopback, due to strange routing policy
rules, ICMP rate limiting still works via peer ratelimiting via
icmpv4_xrlim_allow().  Thus, we should still comply with RFC1812
(section 4.3.2.8 "Rate Limiting").

This seems to fix the reproducer given by Florian.  While still
avoiding to perform expensive and unneeded outgoing route lookup for
rate limited packets (in the non-loopback case).
