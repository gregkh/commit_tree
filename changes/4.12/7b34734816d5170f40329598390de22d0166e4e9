drm: vc4: remove redundant check of plane being non-null

The pointer plane is always null on the error path at label 'fail'
hence the check if it is non-null is redundant. We can therefore
remove the check and the destruction of plane as well as the fail
error path and instead just return an -ENOMEM ERR_PTR.
