IB/core: Define 'ib' and 'roce' rdma_ah_attr types

rdma_ah_attr can now be either ib or roce allowing
core components to use one type or the other and also
to define attributes unique to a specific type. struct
ib_ah is also initialized with the type when its first
created. This ensures that calls such as modify_ah
dont modify the type of the address handle attribute.
