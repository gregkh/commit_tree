USB: serial: io_edgeport: simplify and tighten endpoint check

Simplify the endpoint sanity check by letting core verify that the
required endpoints are present.

Also require the presence of a bulk-out endpoint, something which
prevents the driver from trying to send bulk messages over the control
pipe should a bulk-out endpoint be missing.
