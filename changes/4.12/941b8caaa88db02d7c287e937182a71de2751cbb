drm: extract legacy framebuffer remove

I got confused every time I audited what that lock_all is doing in
there until realizing it's for legacy kms only. Make that a notch more
obvious by having 2 entirely different paths.

While at it also move the atomic version of this into
drm_framebuffer.c, there's no reason it needs to be in drm_atomic.c.
That way it becomes a simple static function.
