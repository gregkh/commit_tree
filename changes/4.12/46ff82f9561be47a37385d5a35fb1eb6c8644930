staging: lustre: ldlm: handle ldlm lock cancel race when evicting client.

A ldlm lock could be canceled simutaneously by ldlm bl thread and
cleanup_resource(). In this case, only one side will win the race
and the other side should wait for the work to complete. Eviction
on group lock is now well supported.
