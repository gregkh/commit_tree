xfs: abstract PF_FSTRANS to PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS

xfs has defined PF_FSTRANS to declare a scope GFP_NOFS semantic quite
some time ago.  We would like to make this concept more generic and use
it for other filesystems as well.  Let's start by giving the flag a more
generic name PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS which is in line with an exiting
PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO already used for the same purpose for GFP_NOIO
contexts.  Replace all PF_FSTRANS usage from the xfs code in the first
step before we introduce a full API for it as xfs uses the flag directly
anyway.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
