net: ena: bug fix in lost tx packets detection mechanism

check_for_missing_tx_completions() is called from a timer
task and looking for lost tx packets.
The old implementation accumulate all the lost tx packets
and did not check if those packets were retrieved on a later stage.
This cause to a situation where the driver reset
the device for no reason.
