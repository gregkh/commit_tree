drm/i915: Inline __i915_gem_request_wait_for_execute()

It had only one callsite and existed to keep the code clearer. Now
having shared the wait-on-error between phases and with plans to change
the wait-for-execute in the next few patches, remove the out of line
wait loop and move it into the main body of i915_wait_request.
