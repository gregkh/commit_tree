ip6_tunnel: Fix missing tunnel encapsulation limit option

The IPv6 tunneling code tries to insert IPV6_TLV_TNL_ENCAP_LIMIT and
IPV6_TLV_PADN options when an encapsulation limit is defined (the
default is a limit of 4).  An MTU adjustment is done to account for
these options as well.  However, the options are never present in the
generated packets.

The issue appears to be a subtlety between IPV6_DSTOPTS and
IPV6_RTHDRDSTOPTS defined in RFC 3542.  When the IPIP tunnel driver was
written, the encap limit options were included as IPV6_RTHDRDSTOPTS in
dst0opt of struct ipv6_txoptions.  Later, ipv6_push_nfrags_opts was
(correctly) updated to require IPV6_RTHDR options when IPV6_RTHDRDSTOPTS
are to be used.  This caused the options to no longer be included in v6
encapsulated packets.

The fix is to use IPV6_DSTOPTS (in dst1opt of struct ipv6_txoptions)
instead.  IPV6_DSTOPTS do not have the additional IPV6_RTHDR requirement.
