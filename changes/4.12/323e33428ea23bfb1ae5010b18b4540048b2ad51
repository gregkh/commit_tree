scsi: cxlflash: Fence EEH during probe

An EEH during probe can lead to a crash as the recovery thread races with the
probe thread. To avoid this issue, introduce new states to fence out EEH
recovery until probe has completed. Also ensure the reset wait queue is
flushed during device removal to avoid orphaned threads.
