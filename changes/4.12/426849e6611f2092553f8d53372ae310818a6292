net: stmmac: fix completely hung TX when using TSO

stmmac_tso_allocator can fail to set the Last Descriptor bit
on a descriptor that actually was the last descriptor.

This happens when the buffer of the last descriptor ends
up having a size of exactly TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE.

When the IP eventually reaches the next last descriptor,
which actually has the bit set, the DMA will hang.

When the DMA hangs, we get a tx timeout, however,
since stmmac does not do a complete reset of the IP
in stmmac_tx_timeout, we end up in a state with
completely hung TX.
