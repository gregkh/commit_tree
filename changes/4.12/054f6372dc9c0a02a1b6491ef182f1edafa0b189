net: mvpp2: introduce an intermediate union for the TX/RX descriptors

Since the format of the HW descriptors is different between PPv2.1 and
PPv2.2, this commit introduces an intermediate union, with for now
only the PPv2.1 descriptors. The bulk of the driver code only
manipulates opaque mvpp2_tx_desc and mvpp2_rx_desc pointers, and the
descriptors can only be accessed and modified through the accessor
functions. A follow-up commit will add the descriptor definitions for
PPv2.2.
