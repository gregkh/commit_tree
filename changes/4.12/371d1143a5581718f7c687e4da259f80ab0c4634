[media] mxl111sf: reduce stack usage in init function

mxl111sf uses a lot of kernel stack memory as it puts an i2c_client
structure on the stack:

drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/mxl111sf.c: In function 'mxl111sf_init':
drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/mxl111sf.c:953:1: error: the frame size of 1248 bytes is larger than 1152 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

We can avoid doing this by open-coding the call to i2c_transfer()
instead of calling tveeprom_read(), and not passing an i2c_client
pointer to tveeprom_hauppauge_analog(), which would ignore that
anyway.
