NFS: Use ERR_CAST() to avoid cross-structure cast

When the call to nfs_devname() fails, the error path attempts to retain
the error via the mnt variable, but this requires a cast across very
different types (char * to struct vfsmount *), which the upcoming
structure layout randomization plugin flags as being potentially
dangerous in the face of randomization. This is a false positive, but
what this code actually wants to do is retain the error value, so this
patch explicitly sets it, instead of using what seems to be an
unexpected cast.
