xfs: bad assertion for delalloc an extent that start at i_size

By run fsstress long enough time enough in RHEL-7, I find an
assertion failure (harder to reproduce on linux-4.11, but problem
is still there):

  XFS: Assertion failed: (iflags & BMV_IF_DELALLOC) != 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs_bmap_util.c

The assertion is in xfs_getbmap() funciton:

  if (map[i].br_startblock == DELAYSTARTBLOCK &&
-->   map[i].br_startoff <= XFS_B_TO_FSB(mp, XFS_ISIZE(ip)))
          ASSERT((iflags & BMV_IF_DELALLOC) != 0);

When map[i].br_startoff == XFS_B_TO_FSB(mp, XFS_ISIZE(ip)), the
startoff is just at EOF. But we only need to make sure delalloc
extents that are within EOF, not include EOF.
