Btrfs: clear EXTENT_DEFRAG bits in finish_ordered_io

Before this, we use 'filled' mode here, ie. if all range has been
filled with EXTENT_DEFRAG bits, get to clear it, but if the defrag
range joins the adjacent delalloc range, then we'll have EXTENT_DEFRAG
bits in extent_state until releasing this inode's pages, and that
prevents extent_data from being freed.

This clears the bit if any was found within the ordered extent.
