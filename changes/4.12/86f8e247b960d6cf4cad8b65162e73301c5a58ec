test_bpf: Use ULL suffix for 64-bit constants

On 32-bit:

    lib/test_bpf.c:4772: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘unsigned long’ type
    lib/test_bpf.c:4772: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘unsigned long’ type

    lib/test_bpf.c:4802: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘unsigned long’ type
    lib/test_bpf.c:4802: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘unsigned long’ type

On 32-bit systems, "long" is only 32-bit.
Replace the "UL" suffix by "ULL" to fix this.
