block: Fix bdi assignment to bdev inode when racing with disk delete

When disk->fops->open() in __blkdev_get() returns -ERESTARTSYS, we
restart the process of opening the block device. However we forget to
switch bdev->bd_bdi back to noop_backing_dev_info and as a result bdev
inode will be pointing to a stale bdi. Fix the problem by setting
bdev->bd_bdi later when __blkdev_get() is already guaranteed to succeed.
