drm: omap: use common OF graph helpers

The OMAP driver has its own OF graph helpers that are similar to the
common helpers. This commit replaces most of the calls with the common
helpers. There's still a couple of custom helpers left, but the driver
needs more extensive changes to get rid of them.

In dss_init_ports, we invert the loop, looping through the known ports
and matching them to DT nodes rather than looping thru DT nodes and
matching them to the ports.
