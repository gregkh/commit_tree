ASoC: Intel: Atom: update Thinkpad 10 quirk

There are multiple skews of the same Lenovo audio hardware
based on the Realtek RT5670 codec.

Manufacturer: LENOVO
        Product Name: 20C1CTO1WW
        Version: ThinkPad 10

Manufacturer: LENOVO
	Product Name: 20C3001VHH
	Version: ThinkPad 10

Manufacturer: LENOVO
	Product Name: 20C10024GE
	Version: ThinkPad Tablet B

Manufacturer: LENOVO
	Product Name: 20359
	Version: Lenovo Miix 2 10

For all these devices, the same quirk is used to force
the machine driver to be based on RT5670 instead of RT5640
as indicated by the BIOS.
