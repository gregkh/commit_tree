[media] media: add CEC notifier support

Add support for CEC notifiers, which is used to convey CEC physical address
information from video drivers to their CEC counterpart driver(s).

Based on an earlier version from Russell King:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9277043/

The cec_notifier is a reference counted object containing the CEC physical address
state of a video device.

When a new notifier is registered the current state will be reported to
that notifier at registration time.
