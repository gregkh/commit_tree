blk-mq: include errors in did_work calculation

Currently we return true in blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() if we queued IO
successfully, but we really want to return whether or not the we made
progress. Progress includes if we got an error return.  If we don't,
this can lead to a hang in blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests() when a
driver is draining IO by returning BLK_MQ_QUEUE_ERROR instead of
manually ending the IO in error and return BLK_MQ_QUEUE_OK.
