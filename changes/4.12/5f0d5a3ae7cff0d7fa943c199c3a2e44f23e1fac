mm: Rename SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU to SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU

A group of Linux kernel hackers reported chasing a bug that resulted
from their assumption that SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU provided an existence
guarantee, that is, that no block from such a slab would be reallocated
during an RCU read-side critical section.  Of course, that is not the
case.  Instead, SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU only prevents freeing of an entire
slab of blocks.

However, there is a phrase for this, namely "type safety".  This commit
therefore renames SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU to SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU in order
to avoid future instances of this sort of confusion.
