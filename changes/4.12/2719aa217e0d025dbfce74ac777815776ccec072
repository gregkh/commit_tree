blk-mq: don't use sync workqueue flushing from drivers

A previous commit introduced the sync flush, which we need from
internal callers like blk_mq_quiesce_queue(). However, we also
call the stop helpers from drivers, particularly from ->queue_rq()
when we have to stop processing for a bit. We can't block from
those locations, and we don't have to guarantee that we're
fully flushed.
