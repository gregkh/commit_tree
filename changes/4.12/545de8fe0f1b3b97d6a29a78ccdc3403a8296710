apparmor: fix parameters so that the permission test is bypassed at boot

Boot parameters are written before apparmor is ready to answer whether
the user is policy_view_capable(). Setting the parameters at boot results
in an oops and failure to boot. Setting the parameters at boot is
obviously allowed so skip the permission check when apparmor is not
initialized.

While we are at it move the more complicated check to last.
