usb: gadget: legacy gadgets are optional

With commit bc49d1d17dcf ("usb: gadget: don't couple configfs to legacy
gadgets"),it is possible to build a modular kernel with both built-in
configfs support and modular legacy gadget drivers.

But when building a kernel without modules, it is also necessary to be
able to build with configfs but without any legacy gadget driver. This
was a possible configuration when the USB_CONFIGFS was a part of the
choice options, but not anymore.

Mark the choice for legacy gadget drivers as optional restores this.
