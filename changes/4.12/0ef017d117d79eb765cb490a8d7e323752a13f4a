mm, swap: improve readability via make spin_lock/unlock balanced

This is just a cleanup patch, no functionality change.

In cluster_list_add_tail(), spin_lock_nested() is used to lock the
cluster, while unlock_cluster() is used to unlock the cluster.  To
improve the code readability, use spin_unlock() directly to unlock the
cluster.
