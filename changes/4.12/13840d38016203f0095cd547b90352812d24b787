dm bufio: make the parameter "retain_bytes" unsigned long

Change the type of the parameter "retain_bytes" from unsigned to
unsigned long, so that on 64-bit machines the user can set more than
4GiB of data to be retained.

Also, change the type of the variable "count" in the function
"__evict_old_buffers" to unsigned long.  The assignment
"count = c->n_buffers[LIST_CLEAN] + c->n_buffers[LIST_DIRTY];"
could result in unsigned long to unsigned overflow and that could result
in buffers not being freed when they should.

While at it, avoid division in get_retain_buffers().  Division is slow,
we can change it to shift because we have precalculated the log2 of
block size.
