ARM: decompressor: Remove __hyp_get_vectors usage

When the compressed image needs to be relocated to avoid being
overwritten by the decompression process, we need to relocate
the hyp vectors as well so that we can find them once the
decompression has taken effect.

For that, we perform the following calculation:
	u32 v = __hyp_get_vectors();
	v += offset;
	__hyp_set_vectors(v);

But we're guaranteed that the initial value of v as returned by
__hyp_get_vectors is always __hyp_stub_vectors, because we have
just set it by calling __hyp_stub_install.

So let's remove the use of __hyp_get_vectors, and directly use
__hyp_stub_vectors instead.
