scsi: make scsi_eh_scmd_add() always succeed

scsi_eh_scmd_add() currently only will fail if no
error handler thread is started (which will never be the
case) or if the state machine encounters an illegal transition.

But if we're encountering an invalid state transition
chances is we cannot fixup things with the error handler.
So better add a WARN_ON for illegal host states and
make scsi_dh_scmd_add() a void function.
