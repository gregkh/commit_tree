drm/i915: Differentiate between sw write location into ring and last hw read

We need to keep track of the last location we ask the hw to read up to
(RING_TAIL) separately from our last write location into the ring, so
that in the event of a GPU reset we do not tell the HW to proceed into
a partially written request (which can happen if that request is waiting
for an external signal before being executed).

v2: Refactor intel_ring_reset() (Mika)
