staging: bcm2835-camera: Convert client_component field to u32

In the messages passed back and forth between the camera and
the firmware, a client_component field is passed.

This is a pointer to a structure that represents part of the
camera. Luckly, it's only used for debug logging, so simply
convert it to a u32.
