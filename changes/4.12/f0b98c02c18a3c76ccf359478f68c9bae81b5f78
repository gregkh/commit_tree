kvm: vmx: Don't use INVVPID when EPT is enabled

According to the Intel SDM, volume 3, section 28.3.2: Creating and
Using Cached Translation Information, "No linear mappings are used
while EPT is in use." INVEPT will invalidate both the guest-physical
mappings and the combined mappings in the TLBs and paging-structure
caches, so an INVVPID is superfluous.
