ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix IPC rx_list corruption

In SKL+ platforms, all IPC commands are serialised, i.e. the driver sends
a new IPC to DSP, only after receiving a reply from the firmware for the
current IPC.

Hence it seems apparent that there is only a single modifier of the IPC RX
List. However, during an IPC timeout case in a multithreaded environment,
there is a possibility of the list element being deleted two times if not
properly protected.

So, use spin lock save/restore to prevent rx_list corruption.
