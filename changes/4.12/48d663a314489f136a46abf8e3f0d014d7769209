lightnvm: enable nvme size compile asserts

The asserts in _nvme_nvm_check_size are not compiled due to the function
not begin called. Make sure that it is called, and also fix the wrong
sizes of asserts for nvme_nvm_addr_format, and nvme_nvm_bb_tbl, which
checked for number of bits instead of bytes.
