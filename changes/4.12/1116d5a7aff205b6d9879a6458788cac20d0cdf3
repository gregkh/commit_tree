clk: tegra: Don't reset PLL-CX if it is already enabled

Commit 8dce89a1c2cf ("clk: tegra: Don't warn for PLL defaults
unnecessarily") changed the tegra210_pllcx_set_defaults() function
causing the PLL to always be reset regardless of whether it is in-use.
This function was changed so that resetting of the PLL will only be
skipped if the PLL is enabled AND 'pllcx->params->defaults_set' is not
true. However, the 'pllcx->params->defaults_set' is always true and
hence, the PLL is now always reset. This causes the boot to fail on the
Tegra210 Smaug where the PLL is already enabled and in-use. Fix this by
only resetting the PLL if not in-use and only printing the warning that
the defaults are not set after we have checked the default settings.
