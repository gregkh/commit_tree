New kernel function to get IP overhead on a socket.

A new function, kernel_sock_ip_overhead(), is provided
to calculate the cumulative overhead imposed by the IP
Header and IP options, if any, on a socket's payload.
The new function returns an overhead of zero for sockets
that do not belong to the IPv4 or IPv6 address families.
This is used in the L2TP code path to compute the
total outer IP overhead on the L2TP tunnel socket when
calculating the default MTU for Ethernet pseudowires.
