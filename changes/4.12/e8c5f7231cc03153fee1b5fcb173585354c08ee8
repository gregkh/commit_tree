i40e: Swap use of pf->flags and pf->hw_disabled_flags for ATR Eviction

This is a minor cleanup so that we are always updating pf->flags when we
make a change to the private flags instead of updating a mix of either
pf->flags and/or pf->hw_disabled_flags.

In addition I went through and cleaned out all the spots where we were
using the X722 define in regards to this flag.

Lastly since we changed the logic I went through and flushed out any
redundancy and cleaned up the handling of the flags in the Tx path.
