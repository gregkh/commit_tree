dm: add dax_device and dax_operations support

Allocate a dax_device to represent the capacity of a device-mapper
instance. Provide a ->direct_access() method via the new dax_operations
indirection that mirrors the functionality of the current direct_access
support via block_device_operations.  Once fs/dax.c has been converted
to use dax_operations the old dm_blk_direct_access() will be removed.

A new helper dm_dax_get_live_target() is introduced to separate some of
the dm-specifics from the direct_access implementation.

This enabling is only for the top-level dm representation to upper
layers. Converting target direct_access implementations is deferred to a
separate patch.
