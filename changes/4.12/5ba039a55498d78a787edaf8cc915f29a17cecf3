x86/apic: Fix a comment in init_apic_mappings()

commit c0104d38a740 ("x86, apic: Unify identical register_lapic_address()
functions") renames acpi_register_lapic_address to register_lapic_address.

But acpi_register_lapic_address remains in a comment, and renaming it to
register_lapic_address is not suitable for this comment.

Remove acpi_register_lapic_address and rewrite the comment.

[ tglx: LAPIC address can be registered either by ACPI/MADT or MP info ]
