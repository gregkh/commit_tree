frv: declare jiffies to be located in the .data section

Commit 7c30f352c852 ("jiffies.h: declare jiffies and jiffies_64 with
____cacheline_aligned_in_smp") removed a section specification from the
jiffies declaration that caused conflicts on some platforms.

Unfortunately this change broke the build for frv:

  kernel/built-in.o: In function `__do_softirq': (.text+0x6460): relocation truncated to fit: R_FRV_GPREL12 against symbol
      `jiffies' defined in *ABS* section in .tmp_vmlinux1
  kernel/built-in.o: In function `__do_softirq': (.text+0x6574): relocation truncated to fit: R_FRV_GPREL12 against symbol
      `jiffies' defined in *ABS* section in .tmp_vmlinux1
  kernel/built-in.o: In function `pwq_activate_delayed_work': workqueue.c:(.text+0x15b9c): relocation truncated to fit: R_FRV_GPREL12 against
      symbol `jiffies' defined in *ABS* section in .tmp_vmlinux1
  ...

Add __jiffy_arch_data to the declaration of jiffies and use it on frv to
include the section specification.  For all other platforms
__jiffy_arch_data (currently) has no effect.
