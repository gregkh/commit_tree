fpga fr br: update supported version numbers

The value in the version register of the altera freeze bridge
controller changed from the beta value of 2 to the
value of 0xad000003 in the official release of the IP.
This patch supports the old and new version numbers, and the
driver's probe function will fail if neither of the supported
versions is found.
