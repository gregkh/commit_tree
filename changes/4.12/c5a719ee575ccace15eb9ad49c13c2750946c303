iwlwifi: mvm: add queues after adding station

Currently aux & broadcast queues are added before calling add
station, which results with a SCD_QUEUE_CFG command sent with
a station id unknown yet to fw.
While this works for pre-a000 firmware, the a000 fw requires
the order to be reversed.
The reason the change is only for a000 devices and not for
previous devices is that we cannot reverse the order since
the tfd_queue_mask containing the aux queue will cause FW to
assert on adding a queue mask with a queue that is not enabled.
This is not a problem in a000 fw since the tfd_queue_mask was
removed from the add sta API.
