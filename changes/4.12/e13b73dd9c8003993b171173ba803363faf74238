x86/hugetlb: Adjust to the new native/compat mmap bases

Commit 1b028f784e8c introduced two mmap() bases for 32-bit syscalls and for
64-bit syscalls. The mmap() code in x86 was modified to handle the
separation, but the patch series missed to update the hugetlb code.

As a consequence a 32bit application mapping a file on hugetlbfs uses the
64-bit mmap base for address space allocation, which fails.

Adjust the hugetlb mapping code to use the proper bases depending on the
syscall invocation mode (64-bit or compat).

[ tglx: Massaged changelog and switched from asm/compat.h to linux/compat.h ]

Fixes: commit 1b028f784e8c ("x86/mm: Introduce mmap_compat_base() for 32-bit mmap()")
