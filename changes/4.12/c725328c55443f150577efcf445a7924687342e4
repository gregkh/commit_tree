Btrfs: enable repair during read for raid56 profile

Now that scrub can fix data errors with the help of parity for raid56
profile, repair during read is able to as well.

Although the mirror num in raid56 scenario has different meanings, i.e.
0 or 1: read data directly
> 1:    do recover with parity,
it could be fit into how we repair bad block during read.

The trick is to use BTRFS_MAP_READ instead of BTRFS_MAP_WRITE to get the
device and position on it.
