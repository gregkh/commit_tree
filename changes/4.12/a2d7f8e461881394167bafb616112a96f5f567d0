mm: don't avoid high-priority reclaim on unreclaimable nodes

Commit 246e87a93934 ("memcg: fix get_scan_count() for small targets")
sought to avoid high reclaim priorities for kswapd by forcing it to scan
a minimum amount of pages when lru_pages >> priority yielded nothing.

Commit b95a2f2d486d ("mm: vmscan: convert global reclaim to per-memcg
LRU lists"), due to switching global reclaim to a round-robin scheme
over all cgroups, had to restrict this forceful behavior to
unreclaimable zones in order to prevent massive overreclaim with many
cgroups.

The latter patch effectively neutered the behavior completely for all
but extreme memory pressure.  But in those situations we might as well
drop the reclaimers to lower priority levels.  Remove the check.
