KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: vgic_v3_lpi_sync_pending_status

this new helper synchronizes the irq pending_latch
with the LPI pending bit status found in rdist pending table.
As the status is consumed, we reset the bit in pending table.

As we need the PENDBASER_ADDRESS() in vgic-v3, let's move its
definition in the irqchip header. We restore the full length
of the field, ie [51:16]. Same for PROPBASER_ADDRESS with full
field length of [51:12].
