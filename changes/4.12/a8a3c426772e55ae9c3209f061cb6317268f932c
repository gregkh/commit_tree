KVM: MIPS: Add VZ & TE capabilities

Add new KVM_CAP_MIPS_VZ and KVM_CAP_MIPS_TE capabilities, and in order
to allow MIPS KVM to support VZ without confusing old users (which
expect the trap & emulate implementation), define and start checking
KVM_CREATE_VM type codes.

The codes available are:

 - KVM_VM_MIPS_TE = 0

   This is the current value expected from the user, and will create a
   VM using trap & emulate in user mode, confined to the user mode
   address space. This may in future become unavailable if the kernel is
   only configured to support VZ, in which case the EINVAL error will be
   returned and KVM_CAP_MIPS_TE won't be available even though
   KVM_CAP_MIPS_VZ is.

 - KVM_VM_MIPS_VZ = 1

   This can be provided when the KVM_CAP_MIPS_VZ capability is available
   to create a VM using VZ, with a fully virtualized guest virtual
   address space. If VZ support is unavailable in the kernel, the EINVAL
   error will be returned (although old kernels without the
   KVM_CAP_MIPS_VZ capability may well succeed and create a trap &
   emulate VM).

This is designed to allow the desired implementation (T&E vs VZ) to be
potentially chosen at runtime rather than being fixed in the kernel
configuration.
