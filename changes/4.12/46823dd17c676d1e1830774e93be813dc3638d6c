arm64: cpufeature: Make ID reg accessor naming less counterintuitive

read_system_reg() can readily be confused with read_sysreg(),
whereas these are really quite different in their meaning.

This patches attempts to reduce the ambiguity be reserving "sysreg"
for the actual system register accessors.

read_system_reg() is instead renamed to read_sanitised_ftr_reg(),
to make it more obvious that the Linux-defined sanitised feature
register cache is being accessed here, not the underlying
architectural system registers.

cpufeature.c's internal __raw_read_system_reg() function is renamed
in line with its actual purpose: a form of read_sysreg() that
indexes on (non-compiletime-constant) encoding rather than symbolic
register name.
