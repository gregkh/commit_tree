iwlwifi: mvm: add GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT cmd for geographic tx power table

To utilize the maximum allowed tx power, an additional table was added
to the BIOS. The table consists of up to seven different regions
(currently only three are in use). Each region contains per band:
1. Maximum allowed tx power on the band.
2. Tx power offset for chain A.
3. Tx power offset for chain B.
On init flow driver reads this table by means of ACPI and
passes it to the firmware with GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT cmd.
The firmware will use this table to enhance tx power with
the offset in the relevant table as well as verifying it does not
violate the maximum allowed tx power.
