drm/nouveau/tmr: fix corruption of the pending list when rescheduling an alarm

At least therm/fantog "attempts" to work around this issue, which could
lead to corruption of the pending alarm list.

Fix it properly by not updating the timestamp without the lock held, or
trying to add an already pending alarm to the pending alarm list....
