HID: logitech-hidpp: add battery support for HID++ 2.0 devices

If the 0x1000 Unified Battery Level Status feature exists, expose the battery
level.

The main drawback is that while a device is plugged in its battery level is 0.
To avoid exposing that as 0% charge we make up a number based on the charging
status.
