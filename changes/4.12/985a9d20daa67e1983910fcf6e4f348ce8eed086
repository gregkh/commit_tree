s390/crypto: Renaming PPNO to PRNO.

The PPNO (Perform Pseudorandom Number Operation) instruction
has been renamed to PRNO (Perform Random Number Operation).
To avoid confusion and conflicts with future extensions with
this instruction (like e.g. provide a true random number
generator) this patch renames all occurences in cpacf.h and
adjusts the only exploiter code which is the prng device
driver and one line in the s390 kvm feature check.
