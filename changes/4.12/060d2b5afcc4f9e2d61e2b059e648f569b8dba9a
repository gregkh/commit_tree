vfio: ccw: introduce ccw_io_region

To provide user-space a set of interfaces to:
1. pass in a ccw program to perform an I/O operation.
2. read back I/O results of the completed I/O operations.
We introduce an MMIO region for the vfio-ccw device here.

This region is defined to content:
1. areas to store arguments that an ssch required.
2. areas to store the I/O results.

Using pwrite/pread to the device on this region, a user-space program
could write/read data to/from the vfio-ccw device.
