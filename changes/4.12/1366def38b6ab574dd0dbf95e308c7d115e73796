s390/pageattr: avoid unnecessary page table splitting

The kernel page table splitting code will split page tables even for
features the CPU does not support. E.g. a CPU may not support the NX
feature.
In order to avoid this, remove those bits from the flags parameter
that correlate with unsupported CPU features within __set_memory(). In
addition add an early exit if the flags parameter does not have any
bits set afterwards.
