NFSv4.1: Work around a Linux server bug...

It turns out the Linux server has a bug in its implementation of
supattr_exclcreat; it returns the set of all attributes, whether
or not they are supported by minor version 1.
In order to avoid a regression, we therefore apply the supported_attrs
as a mask on top of whatever the server sent us.
