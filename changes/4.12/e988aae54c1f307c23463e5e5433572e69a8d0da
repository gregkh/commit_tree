clk: meson8b: put dividers and muxes in tables

Until now, there was only 1 divider and 1 mux declared for the meson8b
platform. With the ongoing work on various system, including audio, this
is about to change. Use the same approach as gates for dividers and muxes,
putting them in tables to fix the register address at runtime.
