Input: matrix_keypad - add option to drive inactive columns

The gpio-matrix-keypad driver normally sets inactive columns as inputs
while scanning. This does not work for all hardware, which may require
the inactive columns to be actively driven in order to overcome any
pull-ups/downs on the columns.
