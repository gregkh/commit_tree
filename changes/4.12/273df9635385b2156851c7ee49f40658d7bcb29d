iommu/dma: Make PCI window reservation generic

Now that we're applying the IOMMU API reserved regions to our IOVA
domains, we shouldn't need to privately special-case PCI windows, or
indeed anything else which isn't specific to our iommu-dma layer.
However, since those aren't IOMMU-specific either, rather than start
duplicating code into IOMMU drivers let's transform the existing
function into an iommu_get_resv_regions() helper that they can share.
