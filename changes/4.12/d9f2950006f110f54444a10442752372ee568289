Revert "NFS: nfs_rename() handle -ERESTARTSYS dentry left behind"

This reverts commit 920b4530fb80430ff30ef83efe21ba1fa5623731 which could
call d_move() without holding the directory's i_mutex, and reverts commit
d4ea7e3c5c0e341c15b073016dbf3ab6c65f12f3 "NFS: Fix old dentry rehash after
move", which was a follow-up fix.
