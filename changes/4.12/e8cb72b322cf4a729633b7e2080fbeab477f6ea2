bdi: Unify bdi->wb_list handling for root wb_writeback

Currently root wb_writeback structure is added to bdi->wb_list in
bdi_init() and never removed. That is different from all other
wb_writeback structures which get added to the list when created and
removed from it before wb_shutdown().

So move list addition of root bdi_writeback to bdi_register() and list
removal of all wb_writeback structures to wb_shutdown(). That way a
wb_writeback structure is on bdi->wb_list if and only if it can handle
writeback and it will make it easier for us to handle shutdown of all
wb_writeback structures in bdi_unregister().
