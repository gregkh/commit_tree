staging: media: atomisp: Remove useless cast.

Explicit type casting of variable, with same type as that of variable,
is not required. The following coccinelle script is used to remove it.

@@
type T;
T *ptr;
T p;
@@
(
- (T *)(&p)
+ &p
|
- (T *)ptr
+ ptr
|
- (T *)(ptr)
+ ptr
|
- (T)(p)
+ p
)

This patch also removes unnecessary parentheses.
