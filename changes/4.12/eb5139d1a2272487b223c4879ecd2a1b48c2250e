cpufreq: intel_pstate: Support HWP processors in all operation modes

Currently, some processors supporting HWP are only supported by
intel_pstate if HWP is actually going to be used and not supported
otherwise which is confusing.

Specifically, they are not supported if "intel_pstate=no_hwp" is
passed to the kernel in the command line or if the driver is started
in the passive mode ("intel_pstate=passive").

There is no real reason for that, because everything about those
processor is known anyway and the driver can work with them in all
modes, so make that happen, but use the load-based P-state selection
algorithm for the active mode "powersave" policy with them.
