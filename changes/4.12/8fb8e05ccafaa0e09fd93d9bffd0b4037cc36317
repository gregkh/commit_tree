staging: ks7010: make abbreviation mgmt uniform

Driver currently uses abbreviations 'mgt' and 'mngmt' for
'management'. Also 'power' is sometimes abbreviated to 'pow' and other
times not. It makes the code easier to read and easier to modify if
one abbreviation is used throughout the driver. 'mgmt' is widely
accepted as an abbreviation of 'management'. 'power' can be spelled
out in full, the extra two characters aids readability without an
excessive cost.

Make abbreviation of 'management' uniform across the driver, function
names, preprocessor defined constants, and enumeration types.
