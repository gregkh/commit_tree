rndis_wlan: add return value validation

Function create_singlethread_workqueue() will return a NULL pointer if
there is no enough memory, and its return value should be validated
before using. However, in function rndis_wlan_bind(), its return value
is not checked. This may cause NULL dereference bugs. This patch fixes
it.
