soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Add support for R-Car H3 ES2.0

Power area A2VC0 was removed in revision ES2.0, cfr. R-Car Gen3 Hardware
User's Manual rev. 0.53E.

Hence remove it from the power area table when not running on ES1.x.

This is in line with the goal to:
  1. Support both the ES1.x and ES2.0 SoC revisions in a single binary
     for now,
  2. Make it clear which code supports ES1.x, so it can easily be
     identified and removed later, when production SoCs are deemed
     ubiquitous.
