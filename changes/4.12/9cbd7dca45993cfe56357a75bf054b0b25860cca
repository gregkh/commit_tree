staging: ccree: fix array_size.cocci warnings

drivers/staging/ccree/ssi_sysfs.c:319:34-35: WARNING: Use ARRAY_SIZE
drivers/staging/ccree/ssi_sysfs.c:429:34-35: WARNING: Use ARRAY_SIZE

 Use ARRAY_SIZE instead of dividing sizeof array with sizeof an element

Semantic patch information:
 This makes an effort to find cases where ARRAY_SIZE can be used such as
 where there is a division of sizeof the array by the sizeof its first
 element or by any indexed element or the element type. It replaces the
 division of the two sizeofs by ARRAY_SIZE.
