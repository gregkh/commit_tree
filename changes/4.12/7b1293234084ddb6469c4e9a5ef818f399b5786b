fsnotify: Add group pointer in fsnotify_init_mark()

Currently we initialize mark->group only in fsnotify_add_mark_lock().
However we will need to access fsnotify_ops of corresponding group from
fsnotify_put_mark() so we need mark->group initialized earlier. Do that
in fsnotify_init_mark() which has a consequence that once
fsnotify_init_mark() is called on a mark, the mark has to be destroyed
by fsnotify_put_mark().
