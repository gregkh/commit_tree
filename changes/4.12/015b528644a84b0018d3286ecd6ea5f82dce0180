watchdog: sama5d4: fix WDDIS handling

The datasheet states: "When setting the WDDIS bit, and while it is set, the
fields WDV and WDD must not be modified."

Because the whole configuration is already cached inside .mr, wait for the
user to enable the watchdog to configure it so it is enabled and configured
at the same time (what the IP is actually expecting).

When the watchdog is already enabled, it is not an issue to reconfigure it.
