pidns: expose task pid_ns_for_children to userspace

pid_ns_for_children set by a task is known only to the task itself, and
it's impossible to identify it from outside.

It's a big problem for checkpoint/restore software like CRIU, because it
can't correctly handle tasks, that do setns(CLONE_NEWPID) in proccess of
their work.

This patch solves the problem, and it exposes pid_ns_for_children to ns
directory in standard way with the name "pid_for_children":

  ~# ls /proc/5531/ns -l | grep pid
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 14 16:38 pid -> pid:[4026531836]
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 14 16:38 pid_for_children -> pid:[4026532286]
