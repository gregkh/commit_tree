can: peak: add support for PEAK PCAN-PCIe FD CAN-FD boards

This patch adds the support of the PCAN-PCI Express FD boards made
by PEAK-System, for computers using the PCI Express slot.

The PCAN-PCI Express FD has one or two CAN FD channels, depending
on the model. A galvanic isolation of the CAN ports protects
the electronics of the card and the respective computer against
disturbances of up to 500 Volts. The PCAN-PCI Express FD can be operated
with ambient temperatures in a range of -40 to +85 Â°C.

Such boards run an extented version of the CAN-FD IP running into USB
CAN-FD interfaces from PEAK-System, so this patch adds several new commands
and their corresponding data types to the PEAK CAN-FD common definitions
header file too.
