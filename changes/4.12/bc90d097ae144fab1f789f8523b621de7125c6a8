drm/i915/gvt: define weight according to vGPU type

The weight defines proportional control of physical GPU resource
shared between vGPUs. So far the weight is tied to a specific vGPU
type, i.e when creating multiple vGPUs with different types, they
will inherit different weights.

e.g. The weight of type GVTg_V5_2 is 8, the weight of type GVTg_V5_4
is 4, so vGPU of type GVTg_V5_2 has double vGPU resource of vGPU type
GVTg_V5_4.

TODO: allow user control the weight setting in the future.
