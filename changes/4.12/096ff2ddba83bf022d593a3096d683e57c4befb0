powerpc/ftrace/64: Split further based on -mprofile-kernel

Split ftrace_64.S further retaining the core ftrace 64-bit aspects
in ftrace_64.S and moving ftrace_caller() and ftrace_graph_caller() into
separate files based on -mprofile-kernel. The livepatch routines are all
now contained within the mprofile file.
