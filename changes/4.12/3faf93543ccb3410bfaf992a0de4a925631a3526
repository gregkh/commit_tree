pstore: constify pstore_zbackend structures

The references of pstore_zbackend structures are stored into the
pointer zbackend of type struct pstore_zbackend. The pointer zbackend
can be made const as it is only dereferenced. After making this change
the pstore_zbackend structures whose references are stored into the
pointer zbackend can be made const too.
