autofs: sanity check status reported with AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_FAIL

If a positive status is passed with the AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_FAIL ioctl,
autofs4_d_automount() will return

   ERR_PTR(status)

with that status to follow_automount(), which will then dereference an
invalid pointer.

So treat a positive status the same as zero, and map to ENOENT.

See comment in systemd src/core/automount.c::automount_send_ready().
