scsi: sd: Ignore sync cache failures when not supported

Some external hard drives don't support the sync command even though the
hard drive has write cache enabled. In this case, upon suspend request,
sync cache failures are ignored if the error code in the sense header is
ILLEGAL_REQUEST. There's not much we can do for these drives, so we
shouldn't fail to suspend for this error case. The drive may stay
powered if that's the setup for the port it's plugged into.
