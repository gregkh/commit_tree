powerpc/eeh: Avoid use after free in eeh_handle_special_event()

eeh_handle_special_event() is called when an EEH event is detected but
can't be narrowed down to a specific PE.  This function looks through
every PE to find one in an erroneous state, then calls the regular event
handler eeh_handle_normal_event() once it knows which PE has an error.

However, if eeh_handle_normal_event() found that the PE cannot possibly
be recovered, it will free it, rendering the passed PE stale.
This leads to a use after free in eeh_handle_special_event() as it attempts to
clear the "recovering" state on the PE after eeh_handle_normal_event() returns.

Thus, make sure the PE is valid when attempting to clear state in
eeh_handle_special_event().
