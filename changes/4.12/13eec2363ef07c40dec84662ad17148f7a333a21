fs: Get proper reference for s_bdi

So far we just relied on block device to hold a bdi reference for us
while the filesystem is mounted. While that works perfectly fine, it is
a bit awkward that we have a pointer to a refcounted structure in the
superblock without proper reference. So make s_bdi hold a proper
reference to block device's BDI. No filesystem using mount_bdev()
actually changes s_bdi so this is safe and will make bdev filesystems
work the same way as filesystems needing to set up their private bdi.
