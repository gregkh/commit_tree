ARM: i.MX25: globally disable supervisor protect

The problem described in commit 6befda9a272b ("ARM: i.MX53: globally
disable supervisor protect") for the i.MX53 platform applies to i.MX25
as well.

E.g. CSPI1+SDMA and SSI1+SDMA are not working with the default AIPS
configuration. Modifiy the AIPS configuration to allow access to the bus
by SDMA and peripherals.
