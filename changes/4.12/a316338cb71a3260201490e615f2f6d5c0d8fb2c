bpf: fix wrong exposure of map_flags into fdinfo for lpm

trie_alloc() always needs to have BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC passed in via
attr->map_flags, since it does not support preallocation yet. We
check the flag, but we never copy the flag into trie->map.map_flags,
which is later on exposed into fdinfo and used by loaders such as
iproute2. Latter uses this in bpf_map_selfcheck_pinned() to test
whether a pinned map has the same spec as the one from the BPF obj
file and if not, bails out, which is currently the case for lpm
since it exposes always 0 as flags.

Also copy over flags in array_map_alloc() and stack_map_alloc().
They always have to be 0 right now, but we should make sure to not
miss to copy them over at a later point in time when we add actual
flags for them to use.
