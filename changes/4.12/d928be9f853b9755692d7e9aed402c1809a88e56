block: add a REQ_NOUNMAP flag for REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES

If this flag is set logical provisioning capable device should
release space for the zeroed blocks if possible, if it is not set
devices should keep the blocks anchored.

Also remove an out of sync kerneldoc comment for a static function
that would have become even more out of data with this change.
