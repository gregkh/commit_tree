md/raid5-cache: bump flush stripe batch size

Bump the flush stripe batch size to 2048. For my 12 disks raid
array, the stripes takes:
12 * 4k * 2048 = 96MB

This is still quite small. A hardware raid card generally has 1GB size,
which we suggest the raid5-cache has similar cache size.

The advantage of a big batch size is we can dispatch a lot of IO in the
same time, then we can do some scheduling to make better IO pattern.

Last patch prioritizes stripes, so we don't worry about a big flush
stripe batch will starve normal stripes.
