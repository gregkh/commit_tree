net: ipv6: Add sysctl for minimum prefix len acceptable in RIOs.

This commit adds a new sysctl accept_ra_rt_info_min_plen that
defines the minimum acceptable prefix length of Route Information
Options. The new sysctl is intended to be used together with
accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen to configure a range of acceptable
prefix lengths. It is useful to prevent misconfigurations from
unintentionally blackholing too much of the IPv6 address space
(e.g., home routers announcing RIOs for fc00::/7, which is
incorrect).
