net: hns: Avoid Hip06 chip TX packet line bug

There is a bug on Hip06 that tx ring interrupts packets count will be
clear when drivers send data to tx ring, so that the tx packets count
will never upgrade to packets line, and cause the interrupts engendered
was delayed.
Sometimes, it will cause sending performance lower than expected.

To fix this bug, we set tx ring interrupts packets line to 1 forever,
to avoid count clear. And set the gap time to 20us, to solve the problem
that too many interrupts engendered when packets line is 1.

This patch could advance the send performance on ARM  from 6.6G to 9.37G
when an iperf send thread on ARM and an iperf send thread on X86 for XGE.
