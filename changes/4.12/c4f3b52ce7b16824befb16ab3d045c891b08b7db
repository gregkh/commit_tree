powerpc/64s: Disallow system reset vs system reset reentrancy

In preparation for using a dedicated stack for system reset interrupts,
prevent a nested system reset from recovering, in order to simplify
code that is called in crash/debug path. This allows a system reset
interrupt to just use the base stack pointer.

Keep an in_nmi nesting counter similarly to the in_mce counter. Consider
the interrrupt non-recoverable if it is taken inside another system
reset.

Interrupt nesting could be allowed similarly to MCE, but system reset
is a special case that's not for normal operation, so simplicity wins
until there is requirement for nested system reset interrupts.
