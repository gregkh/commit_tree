mtd: nand: fsmc: remove ->select_bank() from fsmc_nand_platform_data

Since commit 4404d7d821c3 ("mtd: nand: fsmc: remove stale non-DT probe
path"), only DT probing is used for the fsmc_nand driver. Due to this,
the ->select_bank() field of fsmc_nand_platform_data is never used, so
this commit gets rid of it.
