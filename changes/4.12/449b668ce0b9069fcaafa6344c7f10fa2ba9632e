dm cache: set/clear the cache core's dirty_bitset when loading mappings

When loading metadata make sure to set/clear the dirty bits in the cache
core's dirty_bitset as well as the policy.

Otherwise the cache core is unaware that any blocks were dirty when the
cache was last shutdown.  A very serious side-effect being that the
cleaner policy would therefore never be tasked with writing back dirty
data from a cache that was in writeback mode (e.g. when switching from
smq policy to cleaner policy when decommissioning a writeback cache).

This fixes a serious data corruption bug associated with writeback mode.
