drm/msm: Hard code the GPU "slow frequency"

Some A3XX and A4XX GPU targets required that the GPU clock be
programmed to a non zero value when it was disabled so
27Mhz was chosen as the "invalid" frequency.

Even though newer targets do not have the same clock restrictions
we still write 27Mhz on clock disable and expect the clock subsystem
to round down to zero.

For unknown reasons even though the slow clock speed is always
27Mhz and it isn't actually a functional level the legacy device tree
frequency tables always defined it and then did gymnastics to work
around it.

Instead of playing the same silly games just hard code the "slow" clock
speed in the code as 27MHz and save ourselves a bit of infrastructure.
