drivers/perf: arm_pmu: rename irq request/free functions

For historical reasons, portions of the arm_pmu code use a cpu_pmu_
prefix rather than an armpmu_ prefix. While a minor annoyance, this
hasn't been a problem thusfar.

However, to enable ACPI support, we'll need to expose a few things in
header files, and we should aim to keep those consistently namespaced.
In preparation for exporting our IRQ request/free functions, rename
these to have an armpmu_ prefix. For consistency, the 'cpu_pmu'
parameter is also renamed to 'armpmu'.
