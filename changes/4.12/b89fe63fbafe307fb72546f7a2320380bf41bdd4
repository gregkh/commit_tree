perf symbols: Kill dso__build_id_is_kmod()

The commit e7ee40475760 ("perf symbols: Fix symbols searching for module
in buildid-cache") added the function to check kernel modules reside in
the build-id cache.  This was because there's no way to identify a DSO
which is actually a kernel module.  So it searched linkname of the file
and find ".ko" suffix.

But this does not work for compressed kernel modules and now such DSOs
hCcave correct symtab_type now.  So no need to check it anymore.  This
patch essentially reverts the commit.
