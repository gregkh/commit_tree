staging: greybus: loopback_test: Fix open error path

Change array index from the loop bound variable to loop index.
If a poll file fails to open for any intermediate device, all poll files with
fds of devices from 0 upto that device must be closed in the open_poll_files()
function. The current code only closes the poll file with the most recent fd
allocated, and at times tries to close the same file multiple times.
