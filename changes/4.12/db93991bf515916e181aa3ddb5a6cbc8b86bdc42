drm/i915: Only attempt to signal the request once from the interrupt handler

Check that request has not been signaled before acquiring a reference to
the request for signaling later in the interrupt handler.

The loading of the cacheline (for request->fence.flags) should be "free"
when followed by the locked increment of the request->fence.refcount
(which then sets the cacheline to exclusive mode), i.e. the cost of
test_bit prior to an atomic_inc should be negligible. This should
benefit us when we have a pile of bare breadcrumbs (interrupted execbuf)
where we may get interrupts faster than we can get rid of the
intel_wait, or if the device is too slow to run the bottom-half between
interrupts.
