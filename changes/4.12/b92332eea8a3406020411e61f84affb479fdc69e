clk: gxbb: put dividers and muxes in tables

Until now, there was only 2 dividers and 2 muxes declared for the gxbb
platform. With the ongoing work on various subsystem, including audio,
this is about to change. Use the same approach as gates for dividers and
muxes, putting them in tables to fix the register address at runtime.
