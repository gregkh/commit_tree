qed: Utilize resource-lock based scheme

Management firmware is used as an arbiter between the various PFs
in matters of resources, but some of the resources that need to
be divided are dependent on the non-management firmware used,
so management firmware first needs to be told how many resources
there are before trying to divide them.

As part of the initialization sequence, driver would first inform
the management firmware of the available resources under
a dedicated resource lock, and afterwards request for various
resources which might be based on the previous set values.
