drm: mali-dp: enable gamma support

Add gamma via the DRM GAMMA_LUT/GAMMA_LUT_SIZE CRTC
properties. The expected LUT size is 4096 in order
to produce as accurate a set of segments as possible.

This version uses only the green channel's gamma curve
to set the hardware curve on DP550/650. For the sake of
simplicity, it uses the same table of coefficients for
all 3 curves on DP500.
