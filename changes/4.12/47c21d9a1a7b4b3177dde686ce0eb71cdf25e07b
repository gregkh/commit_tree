drm/i915: Extend vlv/chv residency resolution

Vlv and chv residency counters are 40 bits in width.
With a control bit, we can choose between upper or lower
32 bit window into this counter.

Lets toggle this bit on and off on and read both parts.
As a result we can push the wrap from 13 seconds to 54
minutes.

v2: commit msg, loop readability, goto elimination (Chris)
v3: bug ref, divide outside runtime pm lock (Chris)
