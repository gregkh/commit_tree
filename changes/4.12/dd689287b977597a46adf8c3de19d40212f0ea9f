drm/i915: Prevent concurrent tiling/framebuffer modifications

Reintroduce a lock around tiling vs framebuffer creation to prevent
modification of the obj->tiling_and_stride whilst the framebuffer is
being created. Rather than use struct_mutex once again, use the
per-object lock - this will also be required in future to prevent
changing the tiling whilst submitting rendering.
