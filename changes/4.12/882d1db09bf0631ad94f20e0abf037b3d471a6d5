drm/i915/uc: Rename intel_?uc_{setup, load}() to _init_hw()

GuC historically has two "startup" functions called _init() and _setup()

Then HuC came with it's _init() and _load().

This commit renames intel_guc_setup() and intel_huc_load() to
*uc_init_hw() as they called from the i915_gem_init_hw().

The aim is to be consistent in that entry points called during
particular driver init phases (e.g. init_hw) are all suffixed by that
phase. When reading the leaf functions, it should be clear at what stage
during the driver load it is called and therefore what operations are
legal at that point.

Also, since the functions start with intel_guc and intel_huc they take
appropiate structure.
