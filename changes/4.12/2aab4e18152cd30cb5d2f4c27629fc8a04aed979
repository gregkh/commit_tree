dmaengine: mv_xor_v2: properly handle wrapping in the array of HW descriptors

mv_xor_v2_tasklet() is looping over completed HW descriptors. Before the
loop, it initializes 'next_pending_hw_desc' to the first HW descriptor
to handle, and then the loop simply increments this point, without
taking care of wrapping when we reach the last HW descriptor. The
'pending_ptr' index was being wrapped back to 0 at the end, but it
wasn't used in each iteration of the loop to calculate
next_pending_hw_desc.

This commit fixes that, and makes next_pending_hw_desc a variable local
to the loop itself.
