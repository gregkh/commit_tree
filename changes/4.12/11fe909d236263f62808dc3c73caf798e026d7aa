powerpc/powernv: Add OPAL exports attributes to sysfs

New versions of OPAL have a device node /ibm,opal/firmware/exports, each
property of which describes a range of memory in OPAL that Linux might
want to export to userspace for debugging.

This patch adds a sysfs file under 'opal/exports' for each property
found there, and makes it read-only by root.
