x86/boot/e820: Rename early_reserve_e820() to e820__memblock_alloc() and document it

early_reserve_e820() is an early hack for kexec that does a limited fixup of the
mptable and passes it to the kexec kernel as if it was the real thing.

For this it needs to allocate memory - but no memory allocator is available yet
beyond the memblock allocator, so early_reserve_e820() is really a wrapper
around memblock_alloc() plus a hack to update the e820_table_firmware entries.

The name 'reserve' is really a bit of a misnomer, as 'reserved' memory typically
means memory completely inaccessible to the kernel - while here what we want to do
is a special RAM allocation for our own purposes and insert that as RAM_RESERVED.

Rename the function to e820__memblock_alloc_reserved() to better signal this dual
purpose, plus document it better, which was omitted when it was merged. The barely
comprehensible and cryptic comment:

  /*
   * pre allocated 4k and reserved it in memblock and e820_table_firmware
   */
  u64 __init e820__memblock_alloc_reserved(u64 size, u64 align)

... does not count as documentation, replace it with:

  /*
   * Allocate the requested number of bytes with the requsted alignment
   * and return (the physical address) to the caller. Also register this
   * range in the 'firmware' E820 table.
   *
   * This allows kexec to fake a new mptable, as if it came from the real
   * system.
   */
  u64 __init e820__memblock_alloc_reserved(u64 size, u64 align)

No change in functionality.
