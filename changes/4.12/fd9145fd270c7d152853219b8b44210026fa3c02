x86/xen: use capabilities instead of fake cpuid values for aperf

When running as pv domain xen_cpuid() is being used instead of
native_cpuid(). In xen_cpuid() the aperf/mperf feature is indicated
as not being present by special casing the related cpuid leaf.

Instead of delivering fake cpuid values clear the cpu capability bit
for aperf/mperf instead.
