target: Use kmalloc_array() in compare_and_write_callback()

* A multiplication for the size determination of a memory allocation
  indicated that an array data structure should be processed.
  Thus use the corresponding function "kmalloc_array".

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Replace the specification of a data structure by a pointer dereference
  to make the corresponding size determination a bit safer according to
  the Linux coding style convention.
