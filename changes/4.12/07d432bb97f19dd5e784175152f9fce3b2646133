rxe: Fix a sleep-in-atomic bug in post_one_send

The driver may sleep under a spin lock, and the function call path is:
post_one_send (acquire the lock by spin_lock_irqsave)
  init_send_wqe
    copy_from_user --> may sleep

There is no flow that makes "qp->is_user" true, and copy_from_user may
cause bug when a non-user pointer is used. So the lines of copy_from_user
and check of "qp->is_user" are removed.
