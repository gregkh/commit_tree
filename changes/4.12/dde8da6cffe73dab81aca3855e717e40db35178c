mm: Use static initialization for "srcu"

The MM-notifier code currently dynamically initializes the srcu_struct
named "srcu" at subsys_initcall() time, and includes a BUG_ON() to check
this initialization in do_mmu_notifier_register().  Unfortunately, there
is no foolproof way to verify that an srcu_struct has been initialized,
given the possibility of an srcu_struct being allocated on the stack or
on the heap.  This means that creating an srcu_struct_is_initialized()
function is not a reasonable course of action.  Nor is peppering
do_mmu_notifier_register() with SRCU-specific #ifdefs an attractive
alternative.

This commit therefore uses DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU() to initialize
this srcu_struct at compile time, thus eliminating both the
subsys_initcall()-time initialization and the runtime BUG_ON().
