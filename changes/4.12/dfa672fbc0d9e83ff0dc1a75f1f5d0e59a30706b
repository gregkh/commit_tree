ACPI / property: Add possiblity to retrieve parent firmware node

Sometimes it is useful to be able to navigate firmware node hierarchy
upwards toward parent nodes. ACPI device nodes are pretty much already
supported because ACPICA provides acpi_get_parent(). ACPI data nodes,
however, are all below the same parent ACPI device. Their hierarchy is
created by "linking" each other using references in the value field.

Add parent pointer to the parent data node while we create them so it is
easy to navigate the hierarchy backwards. We use this parent pointer in a
new function acpi_node_get_parent() that is able to extract parent of both
ACPI firmware node types.
