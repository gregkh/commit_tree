ARM: 8675/1: MCPM: ensure not to enter __hyp_soft_restart from loopback and cpu_power_down

Commit 9da5ac236de6 ("ARM: soft-reboot into same mode that we entered
the kernel") added support to enter the new kernel in the same processor
mode as the previous one when we soft-reboot from one kernel into
another by pass a flag to cpu_reset() so it knows what to do exactly.

However it missed to make similar changes in MCPM code. Due to the
missing flag, the CPUs enter HYP mode which is not supported with MCPM.
MCPM works only in secure mode as it manages CCI.

This patch aligns the cpu_reset call in MCPM with other changes in the
above mentioned commit by making phys_reset_t to follow the prototype
of cpu_reset().
