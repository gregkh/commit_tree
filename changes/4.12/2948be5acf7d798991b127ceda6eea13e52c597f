mm: do not use double negation for testing page flags

With the discussion[1], I found it seems there are every PageFlags
functions return bool at this moment so we don't need double negation
any more.  Although it's not a problem to keep it, it makes future users
confused to use double negation for them, too.

Remove such possibility.

Frankly sepaking, I like every PageFlags to return bool instead of int.
It will make it clear.  AFAIR, Chen Gang had tried it but don't know why
it was not merged at that time.
