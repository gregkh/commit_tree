net: ipv4: Refine the ipv4_default_advmss

1. Don't get the metric RTAX_ADVMSS of dst.
There are two reasons.
1) Its caller dst_metric_advmss has already invoke dst_metric_advmss
before invoke default_advmss.
2) The ipv4_default_advmss is used to get the default mss, it should
not try to get the metric like ip6_default_advmss.

2. Use sizeof(tcphdr)+sizeof(iphdr) instead of literal 40.

3. Define one new macro IPV4_MAX_PMTU instead of 65535 according to
RFC 2675, section 5.1.
