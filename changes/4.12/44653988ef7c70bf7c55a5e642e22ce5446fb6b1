drm/i915: Create a fake object for testing huge allocations

We would like to be able to exercise huge allocations even on memory
constrained devices. To do this we create an object that allocates only
a few pages and remaps them across its whole range - each page is reused
multiple times. We can therefore pretend we are rendering into a much
larger object.
