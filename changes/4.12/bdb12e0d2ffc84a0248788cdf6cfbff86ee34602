virtio-net: keep tx interrupts disabled unless kick

Tx napi mode increases the rate of transmit interrupts. Suppress some
by masking interrupts while more packets are expected. The interrupts
will be reenabled before the last packet is sent.

This optimization reduces the througput drop with tx napi for
unidirectional flows such as UDP_STREAM that do not benefit from
cleaning tx completions in the the receive napi handler.
