device-dax: kill NR_DEV_DAX

There is no point to ask how many device-dax instances the kernel should
support. Since we are already using a dynamic major number, just allow
the max number of minors by default and be done. This also fixes the
fact that the proposed max for the NR_DEV_DAX range was larger than what
could be supported by alloc_chrdev_region().
