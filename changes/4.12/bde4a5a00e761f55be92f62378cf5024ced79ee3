PCI: imx6: Allow probe deferral by reset GPIO

Some designs implement reset GPIO via a GPIO expander connected to a
peripheral bus.  One such example would be i.MX7 Sabre board where said
GPIO is provided by SPI shift register connected to a bitbanged SPI bus.
To support such designs, allow reset GPIO request to defer probing of the
driver.
