mailbox: always wait in mbox_send_message for blocking Tx mode

There exists a race when msg_submit return immediately as there was an
active request being processed which may have completed just before it's
checked again in mbox_send_message. This will result in return to the
caller without waiting in mbox_send_message even when it's blocking Tx.

This patch fixes the issue by waiting for the completion always if Tx
is in blocking mode.
