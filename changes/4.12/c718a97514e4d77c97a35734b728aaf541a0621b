fs: semove set but not checked AOP_FLAG_UNINTERRUPTIBLE flag

Commit afddba49d18f ("fs: introduce write_begin, write_end, and
perform_write aops") introduced AOP_FLAG_UNINTERRUPTIBLE flag which was
checked in pagecache_write_begin(), but that check was removed by
4e02ed4b4a2f ("fs: remove prepare_write/commit_write").

Between these two commits, commit d9414774dc0c ("cifs: Convert cifs to
new aops.") added a check in cifs_write_begin(), but that check was soon
removed by commit a98ee8c1c707 ("[CIFS] fix regression in
cifs_write_begin/cifs_write_end").

Therefore, AOP_FLAG_UNINTERRUPTIBLE flag is checked nowhere.  Let's
remove this flag.  This patch has no functionality changes.
