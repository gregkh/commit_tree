mailbox: skip complete wait event if timer expired

If a wait_for_completion_timeout() call returns due to a timeout,
complete() can get called after returning from the wait which is
incorrect and can cause subsequent transmissions on a channel to fail.
Since the wait_for_completion_timeout() sees the completion variable
is non-zero caused by the erroneous/spurious complete() call, and
it immediately returns without waiting for the time as expected by the
client.

This patch fixes the issue by skipping complete() call for the timer
expiry.
