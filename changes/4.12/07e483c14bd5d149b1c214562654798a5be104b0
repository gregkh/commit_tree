staging: ks7010: rename wakeup work struct

struct work_struct uses identifier ks_wlan_wakeup_task, this is
confusing because the 'task' suffix implies that this is a
tasklet_struct instead of a work struct. Suffix 'work' would be more
clear. The code would be easier to read if it followed the principle
of least surprise and used the 'work' suffix for a work_struct
identifier.

Rename work_struct structure 'ks_wlan_wakeup_task' to 'wakeup_work'.
