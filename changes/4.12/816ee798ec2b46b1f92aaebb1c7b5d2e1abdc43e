drm/i915: Only disable execlist preemption for the duration of the request

We need to prevent resubmission of the context immediately following an
initial resubmit (which does a lite-restore preemption). Currently we do
this by disabling all submission whilst the context is still active, but
we can improve this by limiting the restriction to only until we
receive notification from the context-switch interrupt that the
lite-restore preemption is complete.
