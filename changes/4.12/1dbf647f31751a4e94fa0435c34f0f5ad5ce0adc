brcmfmac: fix alignment configuration on host using 64-bit DMA

For SDIO the alignment requirement for transfers from device to host
is configured in firmware. This configuration is limited to minimum
of 4-byte alignment. However, this is not correct for platforms using
64-bit DMA when the minimum alignment should be 8 bytes. This issue
appeared when the ALIGNMENT definition was set according the DMA
configuration. The configuration in firmware was not using that macro
defintion, but a hardcoded value of 4. Hence the driver reported
alignment failures for data coming from the device and causing
transfers to fail.
