nfp: don't spawn netdevs for reconfigured ports

After port reconfiguration (port split, media type change)
firmware will continue to report old configuration until
reboot.  NSP will inform us that reconfiguration is pending.
To avoid user confusion refuse to spawn netdevs until the
new configuration is applied (reboot).

We need to split the netdev to eth_table port matching from
MAC search and move it earlier in the probe() flow.
