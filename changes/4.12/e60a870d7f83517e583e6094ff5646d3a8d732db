drm/i915: Assert that fence->lock is held in an irq-safe manner

Everytime we take the fence->lock (aka request->lock), we must do so
with irqs disabled since it may be used from within an hardirq context.
As sometimes we are taking the lock in a nested manner, assert that the
caller did disable the irqs for us.
