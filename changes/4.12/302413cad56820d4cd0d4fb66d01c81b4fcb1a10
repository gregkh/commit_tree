powerpc/mm/slice: Update slice mask printing to use bitmap printing.

We now get output like below which is much better.

[    0.935306]  good_mask low_slice: 0-15
[    0.935360]  good_mask high_slice: 0-511

Compared to

[    0.953414]  good_mask:1111111111111111 - 1111111111111.........

I also fixed an error with slice_dbg printing.
