usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: add support for usb role swap

This patch adds support for usb role swap via sysfs "role".

For example:
 1) Connect a usb cable using 2 Salvator-X boards.
  - For A-Device, the cable is connected to CN11 (USB3.0 ch0).
  - For B-Device, the cable is connected to CN9 (USB2.0 ch0).
 2) On A-Device, you input the following command:
  # echo peripheral > /sys/devices/platform/soc/ee020000.usb/role
 3) On B-Device, you input the following command:
  # echo host > /sys/devices/platform/soc/ee080200.usb-phy/role

Then, the A-Device acts as a peripheral and the B-Device acts as
a host. Please note that A-Device must input the following command
if you want the board to act as a host again.
 # echo host > /sys/devices/platform/soc/ee020000.usb/role
