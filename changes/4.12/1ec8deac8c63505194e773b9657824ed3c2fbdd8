i40e: explicitly fail on extended MAC field for ethtool_rx_flow_spec

Although we will fail the filter later due to checking flow_type which
will have a bogus invalid type, it is possible future refactoring will
remove this hidden failure case. Avoid a possible issue in the future by
explicitly checking the flow type at the start.
