platform/x86: dell-*: Call new led hw_changed API on kbd brightness change

Make dell-wmi notify on hotkey kbd brightness changes, listen for this
in dell-laptop and call led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed.

This will allow userspace to monitor (poll) for brightness changes on
these LEDs caused by the hotkey.
