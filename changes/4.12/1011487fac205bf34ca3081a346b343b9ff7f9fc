staging: lustre: llite: lower message level for ll_setattr_raw()

Truncate and write can happen at the same time, so that a file can
be set modified even though the file is not restored from released
state, and ll_hsm_state_set() is not applicable for the file, and
it will return error in this case, we'd lower the error message level
in this case.
