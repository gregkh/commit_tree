iommu: Add dummy implementations for !IOMMU_IOVA

Currently, building code which uses the API guarded by the IOMMU_IOVA
will fail to link if IOMMU_IOVA is not enabled. Often this code will be
using the API provided by the IOMMU_API Kconfig symbol, but support for
this can be optional, with code falling back to contiguous memory. This
commit implements dummy functions for the IOVA API so that it can be
compiled out.

With both IOMMU_API and IOMMU_IOVA optional, code can now be built with
or without support for IOMMU without having to resort to #ifdefs in the
user code.
