apparmor: use SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK

When building the kernel with clang, the compiler fails to build
security/apparmor/crypto.c with the following error:

    security/apparmor/crypto.c:36:8: error: fields must have a constant
    size: 'variable length array in structure' extension will never be
    supported
                    char ctx[crypto_shash_descsize(apparmor_tfm)];
                         ^

Since commit a0a77af14117 ("crypto: LLVMLinux: Add macro to remove use
of VLAIS in crypto code"), include/crypto/hash.h defines
SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK to work around this issue. Use it in aa_calc_hash()
and aa_calc_profile_hash().
