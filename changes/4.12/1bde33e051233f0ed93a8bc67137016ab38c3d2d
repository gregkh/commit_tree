include/linux/gfp.h: fix ___GFP_NOLOCKDEP value

Igor Stoppa has noticed that __GFP_NOLOCKDEP can use a lower bit.  At
the time commit 7e7844226f10 ("lockdep: allow to disable reclaim lockup
detection") was written we still had __GFP_OTHER_NODE but I have removed
it in commit 41b6167e8f74 ("mm: get rid of __GFP_OTHER_NODE") and forgot
to lower the bit value.

The current value is outside of __GFP_BITS_SHIFT so it cannot be used
actually.
