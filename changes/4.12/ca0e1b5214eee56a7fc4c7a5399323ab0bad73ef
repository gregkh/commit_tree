clocksource: arm_arch_timer: move arch_timer_needs_of_probing into DT init call

To cleanly split code paths specific to ACPI or DT at a higher level,
this patch removes arch_timer_init(), folding the relevant
parts of its logic into existing callers.

This pathes the way for further rework, and saves a few lines.
