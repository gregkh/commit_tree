powerpc/sysfs: Move #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU out of the function body

The entire body of unregister_cpu_online() is inside an #ifdef
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU block. This is ugly and means we create an empty function
when hotplug is disabled for no reason.

Instead move the #ifdef out of the function body and define the function to be
NULL in the else case. This means we'll pass NULL to cpuhp_setup_state(), but
that's fine because it accepts NULL to mean there is no teardown callback, which
is exactly what we want.
