HID: sony: Perform duplicate device check earlier on

Game controllers can be connected twice through USB and BT. Only
one connection is allowed. Currently we perform a check for duplicate
controllers halfway through device initialization. To prevent
'transient' devices, we should do this check as early as we can.
