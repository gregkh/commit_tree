ACPICA: Debugger: Add interpreter blocking mark for single-step mode

ACPICA commit 91af5d18cd40b35f9d5568fb95fc403ff12474e5

When the single-step mode is used, evaluation is actually split by the
single-step command prompts, so this patch correctly marks the evaluation
segment with interpreter lock release/acquire.
This in return fixes an issue that in the single-step command prompt,
commands requiring to hold the namespace lock (ex. namespace) cannot be
executed. ACPICA BZ 1362, fixed by Lv Zheng.
