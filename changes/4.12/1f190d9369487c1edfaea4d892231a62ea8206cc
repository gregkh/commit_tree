i40e: Reprogram port offloads after reset

This patch corrects a major oversight in that we were not reprogramming the
ports after a reset.  As a result we completely lost all of the Rx tunnel
offloads on receive including Rx checksum, RSS on inner headers, and ATR.

The fix for this is pretty standard as all we needed to do is reset the
filter bits to pending for all active filters and schedule the sync event.
