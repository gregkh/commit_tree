staging: unisys: visorhba: fix s-Par to boot with option CONFIG_VMAP_STACK set to y

The root issue is that we are not allowed to have items on the
stack being passed to "DMA" like operations. In this case we have
a vmcall and an inline completion of scsi command.

This patch fixes the issue by moving the variables on stack in
do_scsi_nolinuxstat() to heap memory.
