drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Disable interrupt bottom-half first on idling

Before walking the rbtree of waiters (marking them as complete and waking
them), decouple the interrupt handler. This prevents a race between the
missed waiter waking up and removing its intel_wait (which skips
checking the lock) and the interrupt handler dereferencing the
intel_wait. (Though we do not expect to encounter waiters during idle!)
