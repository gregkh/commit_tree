batman-adv: prevent multiple ARP replies sent by gateways if dat enabled

If dat is enabled it must be made sure that only the backbone gw which has
claimed the remote destination for the ARP request answers the ARP request
directly if the MAC address is known due to the local dat table. This
prevents multiple ARP replies in a common backbone if more than one
gateway already knows the remote mac searched for in the ARP request.
