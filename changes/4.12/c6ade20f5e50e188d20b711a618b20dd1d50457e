libata: reject passthrough WRITE SAME requests

The WRITE SAME to TRIM translation rewrites the DATA OUT buffer.  While
the SCSI code accomodates for this by passing a read-writable buffer
userspace applications don't cater for this behavior.  In fact it can
be used to rewrite e.g. a readonly file through mmap and should be
considered as a security fix.
