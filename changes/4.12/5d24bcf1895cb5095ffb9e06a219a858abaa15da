qed: Move to new load request scheme

Management firmware is used as an arbiter between the various PFs
in regard to loading - it causes the various PFs to load/unload
sequentially and informs each of its appropriate rule in the init.

But the existing flow is too weak to handle some scenarios where
PFs aren't properly cleaned prior to loading.
The significant scenarios falling under this criteria:
  a. Preboot drivers in some environment can't properly unload.
  b. Unexpected driver replacement [kdump, PDA].

Modern management firmware supports a more intricate loading flow,
where the driver has the ability to overcome previous limitations.
This moves qed into using this newer scheme.

Notice new scheme is backward compatible, so new drivers would
still be able to load properly on top of older management firmwares
and vice versa.
