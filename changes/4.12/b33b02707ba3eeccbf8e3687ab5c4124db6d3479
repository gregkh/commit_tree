drm: Peek at the current counter/timestamp for vblank queries

Bypass all the spinlocks and return the last timestamp and counter from
the last vblank if the driver delcares that it is accurate (and stable
across on/off), and the vblank is currently enabled.

This is dependent upon the both the hardware and driver to provide the
proper barriers to facilitate reading our bookkeeping outside of the
vblank interrupt and outside of the explicit vblank locks.
