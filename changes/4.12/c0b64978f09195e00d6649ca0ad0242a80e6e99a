powerpc/eeh: Clean up and document event handling functions

Remove unnecessary tags in eeh_handle_normal_event(), and add function
comments for eeh_handle_normal_event() and eeh_handle_special_event().

The only functional difference is that in the case of a PE reaching the
maximum number of failures, rather than one message telling you of this
and suggesting you reseat the device, there are two separate messages.
