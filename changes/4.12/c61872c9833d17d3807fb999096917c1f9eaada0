firmware: dmi: Add DMI_PRODUCT_FAMILY identification string

Sometimes it is more convenient to be able to match a whole family of
products, like in case of bunch of Chromebooks based on Intel_Strago to
apply a driver quirk instead of quirking each machine one-by-one.

This adds support for DMI_PRODUCT_FAMILY identification string and also
exports it to the userspace through sysfs attribute just like the
existing ones.
