staging: ks7010: reduce level of indentation

Checkpatch emits WARNING: Too many leading tabs - consider code
refactoring. One level of indentation may be removed by inverting an
if statement conditional (and returning if new conditional evaluates
to true). Code contains switch statement that also contains multiple
layers of indentation. Indentation may be reduced by breaking out of
the case statement in multiple places instead of guarding code with
if/else statements.

Invert conditional. Return original error code if new conditional
evaluates to true. Break out of case blocks instead of using
if/else. Do not modify program logic.
