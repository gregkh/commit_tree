drm/i915: Drop spinlocks around adding to the client request list

Adding to the tail of the client request list as the only other user is
in the throttle ioctl that iterates forwards over the list. It only
needs protection against deletion of a request as it reads it, it simply
won't see a new request added to the end of the list, or it would be too
early and rejected. We can further reduce the number of spinlocks
required when throttling by removing stale requests from the client_list
as we throttle.
