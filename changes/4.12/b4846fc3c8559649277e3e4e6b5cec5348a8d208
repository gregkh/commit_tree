igmp: add a missing spin_lock_init()

Andrey reported a lockdep warning on non-initialized
spinlock:

 INFO: trying to register non-static key.
 the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
 turning off the locking correctness validator.

We miss a spin_lock_init() in igmpv3_add_delrec(), probably
because previously we never use it on this code path. Since
we already unlink it from the global mc_tomb list, it is
probably safe not to acquire this spinlock here. It does not
harm to have it although, to avoid conditional locking.
