Revert "KVM: Support vCPU-based gfn->hva cache"

This reverts commit bbd6411513aa8ef3ea02abab61318daf87c1af1e.

I've been sitting on this revert for too long and it unfortunately
missed 4.11.  It's also the reason why I haven't merged ring-based
dirty tracking for 4.12.

Using kvm_vcpu_memslots in kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init and
kvm_vcpu_write_guest_offset_cached means that the MSR value can
now be used to access SMRAM, simply by making it point to an SMRAM
physical address.  This is problematic because it lets the guest
OS overwrite memory that it shouldn't be able to touch.
