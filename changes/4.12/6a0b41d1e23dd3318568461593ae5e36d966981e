x86/mm: Introduce arch_rnd() to compute 32/64 mmap random base

The compat (32bit) mmap() sycall issued by a 64-bit task results in a
mapping above 4GB. That's outside the compat mode address space and
prevents CRIU to restore 32bit processes from a 64bit application.

As a first step to address this, split out the address base randomizing
calculation from arch_mmap_rnd() into a helper function, which can be used
independent of mmap_ia32() based decisions.
