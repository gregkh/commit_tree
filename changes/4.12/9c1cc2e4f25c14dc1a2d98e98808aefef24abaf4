mm, swap: fix comment in __read_swap_cache_async

Commit cbab0e4eec29 ("swap: avoid read_swap_cache_async() race to
deadlock while waiting on discard I/O completion") fixed a deadlock in
read_swap_cache_async().  Because at that time, in swap allocation path,
a swap entry may be set as SWAP_HAS_CACHE, then wait for discarding to
complete before the page for the swap entry is added to the swap cache.

But in commit 815c2c543d3a ("swap: make swap discard async"), the
discarding for swap become asynchronous, waiting for discarding to
complete will be done before the swap entry is set as SWAP_HAS_CACHE.
So the comments in code is incorrect now.  This patch fixes the
comments.

The cond_resched() added in the commit cbab0e4eec29 is not necessary now
too.  But if we added some sleep in swap allocation path in the future,
there may be some hard to debug/reproduce deadlock bug.  So it is kept.
