qed: Uniform IOV queue validation

PF needs to validate the status of VF queues before asking firmware
to configure anything for them, but that validation is done in various
different forms - sometimes inadequate.

Add auxillary functions that can be used for testing of the queue
state and convert the various flows to use those instead of current
existing flows; Also, add missing validations where needed.
