drm: Remove drm_pending_event->pid

We might as well dump the drm_file pointer, that's about as useful
a cookie as the pid. Noticed while typing docs for drm_file and friends.

Since the only consumer of this is the tracepoints I think we can safely
change this - those tracepoints should not be uapi relevant at all. It

    drm: add per-event vblank event trace points

Also note that the nouveau code setting it is entirely pointless:
Since this isn't a vblank event, it will never hit the vblank
tracepoints.
