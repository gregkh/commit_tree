tracing: Have the trace_event benchmark thread call cond_resched_rcu_qs()

The trace_event benchmark thread runs in kernel space in an infinite loop
while also calling cond_resched() in case anything else wants to schedule
in. Unfortunately, on a PREEMPT kernel, that makes it a nop, in which case,
this will never voluntarily schedule. That will cause synchronize_rcu_tasks()
to forever block on this thread, while it is running.

This is exactly what cond_resched_rcu_qs() is for. Use that instead.
