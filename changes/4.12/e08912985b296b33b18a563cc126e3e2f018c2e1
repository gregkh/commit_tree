igb: Add support for ethtool private flag to allow use of legacy Rx

Since there are potential drawbacks to the new Rx allocation approach I
thought it best to add a "chicken bit" so that we can turn the feature off
if in the event that a problem is found.

It also provides a means of validating the legacy Rx path in the event that
we are forced to fall back.  At some point in the future when we are
convinced we don't need it anymore we might be able to drop the legacy-rx
flag.
