net: ipv4: fix multipath RTM_GETROUTE behavior when iif is given

inet_rtm_getroute synthesizes a skeletal ICMP skb, which is passed to
ip_route_input when iif is given. If a multipath route is present for
the designated destination, fib_multipath_hash ends up being called with
that skb. However, as that skb contains no information beyond the
protocol type, the calculated hash does not match the one we would see
for a real packet.

There is currently no way to fix this for layer 4 hashing, as
RTM_GETROUTE doesn't have the necessary information to create layer 4
headers. To fix this for layer 3 hashing, set appropriate saddr/daddrs
in the skb and also change the protocol to UDP to avoid special
treatment for ICMP.
