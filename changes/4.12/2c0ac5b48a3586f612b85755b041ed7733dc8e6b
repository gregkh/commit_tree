serial: exar: Fix stuck MSIs

After migrating 8250_exar to MSI in 172c33cb61da, we can get stuck
without further interrupts because of the special wake-up event these
chips send. They are only cleared by reading INT0. As we fail to do so
during startup and shutdown, we can leave the interrupt line asserted,
which is fatal with edge-triggered MSIs.

Add the required reading of INT0 to startup and shutdown. Also account
for the fact that a pending wake-up interrupt means we have to return 1
from exar_handle_irq. Drop the unneeded reading of INT1..3 along with
this - those never reset anything.

An alternative approach would have been disabling the wake-up interrupt.
Unfortunately, this feature (REGB[17] = 1) is not available on the
XR17D15X.
