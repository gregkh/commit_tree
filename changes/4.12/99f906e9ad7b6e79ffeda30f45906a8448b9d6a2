bridge: add per-port broadcast flood flag

Support for l2 multicast flood control was added in commit b6cb5ac8331b
("net: bridge: add per-port multicast flood flag"). It allows broadcast
as it was introduced specifically for unknown multicast flood control.
But as broadcast is a special case of multicast, this may also need to
be disabled. For this purpose, introduce a flag to disable the flooding
of received l2 broadcasts. This approach is backwards compatible and
provides flexibility in filtering for the desired packet types.
