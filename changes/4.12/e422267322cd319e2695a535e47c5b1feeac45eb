perf: Add PERF_RECORD_NAMESPACES to include namespaces related info

With the advert of container technologies like docker, that depend on
namespaces for isolation, there is a need for tracing support for
namespaces. This patch introduces new PERF_RECORD_NAMESPACES event for
recording namespaces related info. By recording info for every
namespace, it is left to userspace to take a call on the definition of a
container and trace containers by updating perf tool accordingly.

Each namespace has a combination of device and inode numbers. Though
every namespace has the same device number currently, that may change in
future to avoid the need for a namespace of namespaces. Considering such
possibility, record both device and inode numbers separately for each
namespace.
