RDMA/bnxt_re: Add HW workaround for avoiding stall for UD QPs

HW stalls out after 0x800000 WQEs are posted for UD QPs.
To workaround this problem, driver will send a modify_qp cmd
to the HW at around the halfway mark(0x400000) so that FW
can accordingly modify the QP context in the HW to prevent this
stall.
This workaround needs to be done for UD, QP1 and Raw Ethertype
packets. Added a counter to keep track of WQEs posted during post_send.
