x86/boot/32: Fix UP boot on Quark and possibly other platforms

This partially reverts commit:

  23b2a4ddebdd17f ("x86/boot/32: Defer resyncing initial_page_table until per-cpu is set up")

That commit had one definite bug and one potential bug.  The
definite bug is that setup_per_cpu_areas() uses a differnet generic
implementation on UP kernels, so initial_page_table never got
resynced.  This was fine for access to percpu data (it's in the
identity map on UP), but it breaks other users of
initial_page_table.  The potential bug is that helpers like
efi_init() would be called before the tables were synced.

Avoid both problems by just syncing the page tables in setup_arch()
*and* setup_per_cpu_areas().
