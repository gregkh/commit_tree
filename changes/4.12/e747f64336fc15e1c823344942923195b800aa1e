xfrm: NULL dereference on allocation failure

The default error code in pfkey_msg2xfrm_state() is -ENOBUFS.  We
added a new call to security_xfrm_state_alloc() which sets "err" to zero
so there several places where we can return ERR_PTR(0) if kmalloc()
fails.  The caller is expecting error pointers so it leads to a NULL
dereference.
