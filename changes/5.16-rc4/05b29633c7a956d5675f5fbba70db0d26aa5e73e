KVM: X86: Use vcpu->arch.walk_mmu for kvm_mmu_invlpg()

INVLPG operates on guest virtual address, which are represented by
vcpu->arch.walk_mmu.  In nested virtualization scenarios,
kvm_mmu_invlpg() was using the wrong MMU structure; if L2's invlpg were
emulated by L0 (in practice, it hardly happen) when nested two-dimensional
paging is enabled, the call to ->tlb_flush_gva() would be skipped and
the hardware TLB entry would not be invalidated.
