tools: Fix math.h breakage

Commit 98e1385ef24b ("include/linux/radix-tree.h: replace kernel.h with
the necessary inclusions") broke the radix tree test suite in two
different ways; first by including math.h which didn't exist in the
tools directory, and second by removing an implicit include of
spinlock.h before lockdep.h.  Fix both issues.
