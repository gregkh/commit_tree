net/mlx5: Fix use after free in mlx5_health_wait_pci_up

The device health recovery flow calls mlx5_health_wait_pci_up() which
queries the device for FW_RESET timeout after freeing the device
timeouts structure on mlx5_function_teardown(). Fix this bug by moving
timeouts structure init/cleanup to the device's init/uninit phases.
Since it is necessary to reset default software timeouts on function
reload, extract setting of defaults values from mlx5_tout_init() and
call mlx5_tout_set_def_val() directly from mlx5_function_setup().
