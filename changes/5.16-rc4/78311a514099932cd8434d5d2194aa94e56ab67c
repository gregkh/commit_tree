KVM: x86: ignore APICv if LAPIC is not enabled

Synchronize the two calls to kvm_x86_sync_pir_to_irr.  The one
in the reenter-guest fast path invoked the callback unconditionally
even if LAPIC is present but disabled.  In this case, there are
no interrupts to deliver, and therefore posted interrupts can
be ignored.
