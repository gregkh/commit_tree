net/mlx5e: Fix missing IPsec statistics on uplink representor

The cited patch added the IPsec support to uplink representor, however
as uplink representors have his private statistics where IPsec stats
is not part of it, that effectively makes IPsec stats hidden when uplink
representor stats queried.

Resolve by adding IPsec stats to uplink representor private statistics.
