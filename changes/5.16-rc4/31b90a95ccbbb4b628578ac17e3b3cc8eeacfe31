i2c: stm32f7: stop dma transfer in case of NACK

In case of receiving a NACK, the dma transfer should be stopped
to avoid feeding data into the FIFO.
Also ensure to properly return the proper error code and avoid
waiting for the end of the dma completion in case of
error happening during the transmission.
