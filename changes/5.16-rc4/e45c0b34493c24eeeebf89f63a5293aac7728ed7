net/mlx5: Move MODIFY_RQT command to ignore list in internal error state

When the device is in internal error state, command interface isn't
accessible and the driver decides which commands to fail and which
to ignore.

Move the MODIFY_RQT command to the ignore list in order to avoid
the following redundant warning messages in internal error state:

mlx5_core 0000:82:00.1: mlx5e_rss_disable:419:(pid 23754): Failed to redirect RQT 0x0 to drop RQ 0xc00848: err = -5
mlx5_core 0000:82:00.1: mlx5e_rx_res_channels_deactivate:598:(pid 23754): Failed to redirect direct RQT 0x1 to drop RQ 0xc00848 (channel 0): err = -5
mlx5_core 0000:82:00.1: mlx5e_rx_res_channels_deactivate:607:(pid 23754): Failed to redirect XSK RQT 0x19 to drop RQ 0xc00848 (channel 0): err = -5
