drm: msm: fix building without CONFIG_COMMON_CLK

When CONFIG_COMMON_CLOCK is disabled, the 8996 specific
phy code is left out, which results in a link failure:

ld: drivers/gpu/drm/msm/hdmi/hdmi_phy.o:(.rodata+0x3f0): undefined reference to `msm_hdmi_phy_8996_cfg'

This was only exposed after it became possible to build
test the driver without the clock interfaces.

Make COMMON_CLK a hard dependency for compile testing,
and simplify it a little based on that.
