x86/tsc: Add a timer to make sure TSC_adjust is always checked

The TSC_ADJUST register is checked every time a CPU enters idle state, but
Thomas Gleixner mentioned there is still a caveat that a system won't enter
idle [1], either because it's too busy or configured purposely to not enter
idle.

Setup a periodic timer (every 10 minutes) to make sure the check is
happening on a regular base.
