net/mlx4_en: Update reported link modes for 1/10G

When link modes were initially added in commit 2c762679435dc
("net/mlx4_en: Use PTYS register to query ethtool settings") and
later updated for the new ethtool API in commit 3d8f7cc78d0eb
("net: mlx4: use new ETHTOOL_G/SSETTINGS API") the only 1/10G non-baseT
link modes configured were 1000baseKX, 10000baseKX4 and 10000baseKR.
It looks like these got picked to represent other modes since nothing
better was available.

Switch to using more specific link modes added in commit 5711a98221443
("net: ethtool: add support for 1000BaseX and missing 10G link modes").

Tested with MCX311A-XCAT connected via DAC.
