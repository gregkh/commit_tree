x86/entry: Use the correct fence macro after swapgs in kernel CR3

The commit

  c75890700455 ("x86/entry/64: Remove unneeded kernel CR3 switching")

removed a CR3 write in the faulting path of load_gs_index().

But the path's FENCE_SWAPGS_USER_ENTRY has no fence operation if PTI is
enabled, see spectre_v1_select_mitigation().

Rather, it depended on the serializing CR3 write of SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3
and since it got removed, add a FENCE_SWAPGS_KERNEL_ENTRY call to make
sure speculation is blocked.
