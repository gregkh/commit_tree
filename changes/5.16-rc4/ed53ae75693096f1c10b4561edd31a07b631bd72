rt2x00: do not mark device gone on EPROTO errors during start

As reported by Exuvo is possible that we have lot's of EPROTO errors
during device start i.e. firmware load. But after that device works
correctly. Hence marking device gone by few EPROTO errors done by
commit e383c70474db ("rt2x00: check number of EPROTO errors") caused
regression - Exuvo device stop working after kernel update. To fix
disable the check during device start.
