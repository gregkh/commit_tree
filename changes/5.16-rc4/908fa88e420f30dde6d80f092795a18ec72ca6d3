KVM: selftests: Make sure kvm_create_max_vcpus test won't hit RLIMIT_NOFILE

With the elevated 'KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS' value kvm_create_max_vcpus test
may hit RLIMIT_NOFILE limits:

 # ./kvm_create_max_vcpus
 KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID: 4096
 KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS: 1024
 Testing creating 1024 vCPUs, with IDs 0...1023.
 /dev/kvm not available (errno: 24), skipping test

Adjust RLIMIT_NOFILE limits to make sure KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS fds can be
opened. Note, raising hard limit ('rlim_max') requires CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability which is generally not needed to run kvm selftests (but without
raising the limit the test is doomed to fail anyway).
