KVM: SEV: initialize regions_list of a mirror VM

This was broken before the introduction of KVM_CAP_VM_MOVE_ENC_CONTEXT_FROM,
but technically harmless because the region list was unused for a mirror
VM.  However, it is untidy and it now causes a NULL pointer access when
attempting to move the encryption context of a mirror VM.

Fixes: 54526d1fd593 ("KVM: x86: Support KVM VMs sharing SEV context")
