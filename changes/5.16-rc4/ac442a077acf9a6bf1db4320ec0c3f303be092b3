serial: pl011: Add ACPI SBSA UART match id

The document 'ACPI for Arm Components 1.0' defines the following
_HID mappings:
-'Prime cell UART (PL011)': ARMH0011
-'SBSA UART': ARMHB000

Use the sbsa-uart driver when a device is described with
the 'ARMHB000' _HID.

Note:
PL011 devices currently use the sbsa-uart driver instead of the
uart-pl011 driver. Indeed, PL011 devices are not bound to a clock
in ACPI. It is not possible to change their baudrate.
