Revert "tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: drop earlycon entry for i.MX8QXP"

Revert commit b4b844930f27 ("tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: drop earlycon entry
for i.MX8QXP"), because this breaks earlycon support on imx8qm/imx8qxp.
While it is true that for earlycon there is no difference between
i.MX8QXP and i.MX7ULP (for now at least), there are differences
regarding clocks and fixups for wakeup support. For that reason it was
deemed unacceptable to add the imx7ulp compatible to device tree in
order to get earlycon working again.
