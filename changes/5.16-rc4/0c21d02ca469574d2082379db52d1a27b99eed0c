i2c: stm32f7: flush TX FIFO upon transfer errors

While handling an error during transfer (ex: NACK), it could
happen that the driver has already written data into TXDR
before the transfer get stopped.
This commit add TXDR Flush after end of transfer in case of error to
avoid sending a wrong data on any other slave upon next transfer.
