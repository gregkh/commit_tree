drm/msm/gpu: Fix check for devices without devfreq

Looks like 658f4c829688 ("drm/msm/devfreq: Add 1ms delay before
clamping freq") was badly rebased on top of efb8a170a367 ("drm/msm:
Fix devfreq NULL pointer dereference on a3xx") and ended up with
the NULL check in the wrong place.

Fixes: 658f4c829688 ("drm/msm/devfreq: Add 1ms delay before clamping freq")
