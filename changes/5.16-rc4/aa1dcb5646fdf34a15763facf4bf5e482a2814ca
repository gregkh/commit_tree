atlantic: Increase delay for fw transactions

The max waiting period (of 1 ms) while reading the data from FW shared
buffer is too small for certain types of data (e.g., stats). There's a
chance that FW could be updating buffer at the same time and driver
would be unsuccessful in reading data. Firmware manual recommends to
have 1 sec timeout to fix this issue.
