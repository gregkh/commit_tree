RDMA/core: Fix ordering of CQ pool destruction

rxe will hold a refcount on the IB device as long as CQ objects exist,
this causes destruction of a rxe device to hang if the CQ pool has any
cached CQs since they are being destroyed after the refcount must go to
zero.

Treat the CQ pool like a client and create/destroy it before/after all
other clients. No users of CQ pool can exist past a client remove call.
