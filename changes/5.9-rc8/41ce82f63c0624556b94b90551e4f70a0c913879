KVM: arm64: timers: Move timer registers to the sys_regs file

Move the timer gsisters to the sysreg file. This will further help when
they are directly changed by a nesting hypervisor in the VNCR page.

This requires moving the initialisation of the timer struct so that some
of the helpers (such as arch_timer_ctx_index) can work correctly at an
early stage.
