pinctrl: aspeed: Improve debug output

We need to iterate over each pin in a group for a function and
disable higher priority mux configurations on the pin before finally
muxing the relevant function's signal. With the current debug output it
is hard to track what register output is relevant to which operation, so
break up the actions in the debug output by providing some more context.
