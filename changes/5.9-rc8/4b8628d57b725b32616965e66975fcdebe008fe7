xfs: actually bump warning counts when we send warnings

Currently, xfs quotas have the ability to send netlink warnings when a
user exceeds the limits.  They also have all the support code necessary
to convert softlimit warnings into failures if the number of warnings
exceeds a limit set by the administrator.  Unfortunately, we never
actually increase the warning counter, so this never actually happens.
Make it so we actually do something useful with the warning counts.
