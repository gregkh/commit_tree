powerpc/signal_32: Remove !FULL_REGS() special handling in PPC64 save_general_regs()

Since commit ("1bd79336a426 powerpc: Fix various
syscall/signal/swapcontext bugs"), getting save_general_regs() called
without FULL_REGS() is very unlikely and generates a warning.

The 32-bit version of save_general_regs() doesn't take care of it
at all and copies all registers anyway since that commit.

Moreover, commit 965dd3ad3076 ("powerpc/64/syscall: Remove
non-volatile GPR save optimisation") is another reason why it would
never happen.

So the same with 64-bit, don't worry about FULL_REGS() and copy
all registers all the time.
