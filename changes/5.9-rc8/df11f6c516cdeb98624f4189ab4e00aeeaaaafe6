platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Revert "Use strndup_user() in dispatch_proc_write()"

This reverts commit 35d13c7a05126a5a54a1ef40aff4c6984474e604.

This broke procfs interface due to neglecting the fact that
the strings are not coming NULL terminated.

Revert the change till we will have a better clean up.
