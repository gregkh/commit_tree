staging: dpaa2-ethsw: use netif_running when checking for port up

There are some cases where the switch interface needs to be disabled so
that changes in the configuration can be made. In such cases, we should
check for a running interface (bit __LINK_STATE_START of the netdev)
instead of netif_carrier_ok(). This is because on open() we enable the
switch interface even though the link up has not come out yet.
