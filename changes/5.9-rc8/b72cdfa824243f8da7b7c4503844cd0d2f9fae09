HID: lenovo: Merge tpkbd and cptkbd data structures

Merge the tpkbd and cptkbd data structures, into a single unified
structure instead of having a separate data structure per keyboard type.

This is a preparation patch for making the tpkbd LED functions more
generic, so that they can be re-used for supporting the LEDs on the
Thinkpad 10 ultrabook keyboard.
