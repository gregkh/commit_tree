drm/i915: Document our lackluster FSB frequency readout

Document the fact that we aren't reading out the actual FSB
frequency but rather just the state of the FSB straps.
Some BIOSen allow you to configure the two independently.
So if someone sets the two up in an inconsistent manner
we'll get the wrong answer here and thus will end up with
incorrect aux/pps clock dividers. Alas, proper docs are no
longer around so we can't do any better.
