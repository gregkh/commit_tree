refperf: Add holdoff parameter to allow CPUs to come online

This commit adds an rcuperf module parameter named "holdoff" that
defaults to 10 seconds if refperf is built in and to zero otherwise.
The assumption is that all the CPUs are online by the time that the
modprobe and insmod commands are going to do anything, and that normal
systems will have all the CPUs online within ten seconds.

Larger systems may take many tens of seconds or even minutes to get
to this point, hence this being a module parameter instead of being a
hard-coded constant.
