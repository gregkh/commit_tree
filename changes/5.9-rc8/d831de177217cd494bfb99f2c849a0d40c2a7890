KVM: x86: always allow writing '0' to MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_EN

Even without in-kernel LAPIC we should allow writing '0' to
MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_EN as we're not enabling the mechanism. In
particular, QEMU with 'kernel-irqchip=off' fails to start
a guest with

qemu-system-x86_64: error: failed to set MSR 0x4b564d02 to 0x0
