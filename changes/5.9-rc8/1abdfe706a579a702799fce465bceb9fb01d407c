lib: Restrict cpumask_local_spread to houskeeping CPUs

The current implementation of cpumask_local_spread() does not respect the
isolated CPUs, i.e., even if a CPU has been isolated for Real-Time task,
it will return it to the caller for pinning of its IRQ threads. Having
these unwanted IRQ threads on an isolated CPU adds up to a latency
overhead.

Restrict the CPUs that are returned for spreading IRQs only to the
available housekeeping CPUs.
