selftests/bpf: Add variable-length data concatenation pattern test

Add selftest that validates variable-length data reading and concatentation
with one big shared data array. This is a common pattern in production use for
monitoring and tracing applications, that potentially can read a lot of data,
but overall read much less. Such pattern allows to determine precisely what
amount of data needs to be sent over perfbuf/ringbuf and maximize efficiency.
