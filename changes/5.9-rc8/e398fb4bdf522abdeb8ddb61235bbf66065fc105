xen/privcmd: Corrected error handling path

Previously, if lock_pages() end up partially mapping pages, it used
to return -ERRNO due to which unlock_pages() have to go through
each pages[i] till *nr_pages* to validate them. This can be avoided
by passing correct number of partially mapped pages & -ERRNO separately,
while returning from lock_pages() due to error.

With this fix unlock_pages() doesn't need to validate pages[i] till
*nr_pages* for error scenario and few condition checks can be ignored.
