phy: omap-usb2-phy: disable PHY charger detect

AM654x PG1.0 has a silicon bug that D+ is pulled high after POR, which
could cause enumeration failure with some USB hubs.  Disabling the
USB2_PHY Charger Detect function will put D+ into the normal state.

This addresses Silicon Errata:
i2075 - "USB2PHY: USB2PHY Charger Detect is Enabled by Default Without VBUS
Presence"
