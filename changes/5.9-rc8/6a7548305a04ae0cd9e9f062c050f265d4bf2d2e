ARM: dts: bcm2835: Change firmware compatible from simple-bus to simple-mfd

The current binding for the RPi firmware uses the simple-bus compatible as
a fallback to benefit from its automatic probing of child nodes.

However, simple-bus also comes with some constraints, like having the ranges,
our case.

Let's switch to simple-mfd that provides the same probing logic without
those constraints.
