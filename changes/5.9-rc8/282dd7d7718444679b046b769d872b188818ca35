btrfs: reset compression level for lzo on remount

Currently a user can set mount "-o compress" which will set the
compression algorithm to zlib, and use the default compress level for
zlib (3):

  relatime,compress=zlib:3,space_cache

If the user remounts the fs using "-o compress=lzo", then the old
compress_level is used:

  relatime,compress=lzo:3,space_cache

But lzo does not expose any tunable compression level. The same happens
if we set any compress argument with different level, also with zstd.

Fix this by resetting the compress_level when compress=lzo is
specified.  With the fix applied, lzo is shown without compress level:

  relatime,compress=lzo,space_cache
