io_uring: fail poll arm on queue proc failure

Check the ipt.error value, it must have been either cleared to zero or
set to another error than the default -EINVAL if we don't go through the
waitqueue proc addition. Just give up on poll at that point and return
failure, this will fallback to async work.

io_poll_add() doesn't suffer from this failure case, as it returns the
error value directly.
