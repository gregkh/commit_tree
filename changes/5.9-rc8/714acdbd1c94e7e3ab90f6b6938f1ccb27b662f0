arch: rename copy_thread_tls() back to copy_thread()

Now that HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS has been removed, rename copy_thread_tls()
back simply copy_thread(). It's a simpler name, and doesn't imply that only
tls is copied here. This finishes an outstanding chunk of internal process
creation work since we've added clone3().
