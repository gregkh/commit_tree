x86/alternatives: Acquire pte lock with interrupts enabled

pte lock is never acquired in-IRQ context so it does not require interrupts
to be disabled. The lock is a regular spinlock which cannot be acquired
with interrupts disabled on RT.

RT complains about pte_lock() in __text_poke() because it's invoked after
disabling interrupts.

__text_poke() has to disable interrupts as use_temporary_mm() expects
interrupts to be off because it invokes switch_mm_irqs_off() and uses
per-CPU (current active mm) data.

Move the PTE lock handling outside the interrupt disabled region.
