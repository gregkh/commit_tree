ice: Implement LFC workaround

There is a bug where the LFC settings are not being preserved
through a link event.  The registers in question are the ones
that are touched (and restored) when a set_local_mib AQ command
is performed.

On a link-up event, make sure that a set_local_mib is being
performed.

Move the function ice_aq_set_lldp_mib() from the DCB specific
ice_dcb.c to ice_common.c so that the driver always has access
to this AQ command.
