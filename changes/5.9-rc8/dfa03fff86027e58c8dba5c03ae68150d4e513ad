selftests/powerpc: Fix online CPU selection

The size of the CPU affinity mask must be large enough for
systems with a very large number of CPUs. Otherwise, tests
which try to determine the first online CPU by calling
sched_getaffinity() will fail. This makes sure that the size
of the allocated affinity mask is dependent on the number of
CPUs as reported by get_nprocs_conf().
