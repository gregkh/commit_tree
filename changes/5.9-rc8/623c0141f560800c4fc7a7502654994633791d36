mtd: rawnand: timings: Provide onfi_fill_data_interface() with a data interface

Right now the core uses onfi_fill_data_interface() to initialize the
nand_data_interface object embedded in nand_chip, but we are about to
allocate this object dynamically and let manufacturer drivers provide
their own interface config. Let's patch the onfi_fill_data_interface()
so it can initialize an interface config that's not the one
currently attached to the nand_chip.
