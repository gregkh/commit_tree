dyndbg-docs: eschew file /full/path query in docs

Regarding:
commit 2b6783191da7 ("dynamic_debug: add trim_prefix() to provide source-root relative paths")
commit a73619a845d5 ("kbuild: use -fmacro-prefix-map to make __FILE__ a relative path")

2nd commit broke dynamic-debug's "file $fullpath" query form, but
nobody noticed because 1st commit had trimmed prefixes from
control-file output, so the click-copy-pasting of fullpaths into new
queries had ceased; that query form became unused.

Removing the function is cleanest, but it could be useful in
old-compiler corner cases, where __FILE__ still has /full/path,
and it safely does nothing otherwize.

So instead, quietly deprecate "file /full/path" query form, by
removing all /full/paths examples in the docs.  I skipped adding a
back-compat note.
