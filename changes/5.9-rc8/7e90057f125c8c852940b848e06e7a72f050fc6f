usb: typec: ucsi: Fix 2 unlocked ucsi_run_command calls

Fix 2 unlocked ucsi_run_command calls:

1. ucsi_handle_connector_change() contains one ucsi_send_command() call,
which takes the ppm_lock for it; and one ucsi_run_command() call which
relies on the caller have taking the ppm_lock.
ucsi_handle_connector_change() does not take the lock, so the
second (ucsi_run_command) calls should also be ucsi_send_command().

2. ucsi_get_pdos() gets called from ucsi_handle_connector_change() which
does not hold the ppm_lock, so it also must use ucsi_send_command().

This commit also adds a WARN_ON(!mutex_is_locked(&ucsi->ppm_lock)); to
ucsi_run_command() to avoid similar problems getting re-introduced in
the future.
