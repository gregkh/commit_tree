arm64: dts: sdm845: Add OPP table for all qup devices

qup has a requirement to vote on the performance state of the CX domain
in sdm845 devices. Add OPP tables for these and also add power-domains
property for all qup instances for uart and spi.
i2c does not support scaling and uses a fixed clock.
