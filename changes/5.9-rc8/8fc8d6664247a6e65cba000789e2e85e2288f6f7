mm, slub: extend checks guarded by slub_debug static key

There are few more places in SLUB that could benefit from reduced overhead
of the static key introduced by a previous patch:

- setup_object_debug() called on each object in newly allocated slab page
- setup_page_debug() called on newly allocated slab page
- __free_slab() called on freed slab page
