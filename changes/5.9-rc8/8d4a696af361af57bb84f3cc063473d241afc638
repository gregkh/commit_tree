media: staging: rkisp1: set pads array of the resizer to size 2

Currently the 'pads' and 'pad_cfg' arrays of the rkisp1_resizer
are of size 'RKISP1_ISP_PAD_MAX' which is 4. But the resizer
has only two pads. Change the size of the arrays to 2 by adding
and using 'RKISP1_RSZ_PAD_MAX' similar to the way it is done in
the isp entity.
