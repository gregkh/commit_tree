l2tp: tweak exports for l2tp_recv_common and l2tp_ioctl

All of the l2tp subsystem's exported symbols are exported using
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, except for l2tp_recv_common and l2tp_ioctl.

These functions alone are not useful without the rest of the l2tp
infrastructure, so there's no practical benefit to these symbols using a
different export policy.

Change these exports to use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for consistency with the
rest of l2tp.
