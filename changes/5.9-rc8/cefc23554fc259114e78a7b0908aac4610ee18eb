net/mlx5: Fix FTE cleanup

Currently, when an FTE is allocated, its refcount is decreased to 0
with the purpose it will not be a stand alone steering object and every
rule (destination) of the FTE would increase the refcount.
When mlx5_cleanup_fs is called while not all rules were deleted by the
steering users, it hit refcount underflow on the FTE once clean_tree
calls to tree_remove_node after the deleted rules already decreased
the refcount to 0.

FTE is no longer destroyed implicitly when the last rule (destination)
is deleted. mlx5_del_flow_rules avoids it by increasing the refcount on
the FTE and destroy it explicitly after all rules were deleted. So we
can avoid the refcount underflow by making FTE as stand alone object.
In addition need to set del_hw_func to FTE so the HW object will be
destroyed when the FTE is deleted from the cleanup_tree flow.

refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
