net: mscc: ocelot: move ocelot_regs.c into ocelot_vsc7514.c

ocelot_regs.c actually shouldn't be part of the common library. It
describes the register map of the VSC7514 switch. The way ocelot
switches work, they'll have highly optimized register maps, so another
SoC will likely have the same registers but laid out completely
different in memory (so there's little room for reusing this structure).
So move it to ocelot_vsc7514.c instead.
