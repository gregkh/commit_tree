blk-mq: move failure injection out of blk_mq_complete_request

Move the call to blk_should_fake_timeout out of blk_mq_complete_request
and into the drivers, skipping call sites that are obvious error
handlers, and remove the now superflous blk_mq_force_complete_rq helper.
This ensures we don't keep injecting errors into completions that just
terminate the Linux request after the hardware has been reset or the
command has been aborted.
