drm/amd/display: Switch to immediate mode for updating infopackets

[Why]
Using FRAME_UPDATE will result in infopacket to be potentially updated
one frame late.
In commit stream scenarios for previously active stream, some stale
infopacket data from previous config might be erroneously sent out on
initial frame after stream is re-enabled.

[How]
Switch to using IMMEDIATE_UPDATE mode
