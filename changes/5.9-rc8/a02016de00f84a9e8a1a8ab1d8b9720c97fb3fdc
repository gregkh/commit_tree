ice: fix overwriting TX/RX descriptor values when rebuilding VSI

If a user sets the value of the TX or RX descriptors to some non-default
value using 'ethtool -G' then we need to not overwrite the values when
we rebuild the VSI. The VSI rebuild could happen as a result of a user
setting the number of queues via the 'ethtool -L' command. Fix this by
checking to see if the value we have stored is non-zero and if it is
then don't change the value.
