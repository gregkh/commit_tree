torture:  Remove qemu dependency on EFI firmware

On some (probably misconfigured) systems, the torture-test scripting
will cause qemu to complain about missing EFI firmware, often because
qemu is trying to traverse broken symbolic links to find that firmware.
Which is a bit silly given that the default torture-test guest OS has
but a single binary for its userspace, and thus is unlikely to do much
in the way of networking in any case.

This commit therefore avoids such problems by specifying "-net none"
to qemu unless the TORTURE_QEMU_INTERACTIVE environment variable is set
(for example, by having specified "--interactive" to kvm.sh), in which
case "-net nic -net user" is specified to qemu instead.  Either choice
may be overridden by specifying the "-net" argument of your choice to
the kvm.sh "--qemu-args" parameter.
