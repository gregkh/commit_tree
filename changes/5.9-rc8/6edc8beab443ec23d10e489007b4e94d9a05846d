mlxsw: spectrum_span: Do not dereference destination netdev

Currently, the destination netdev to which we mirror must be a valid
netdev. However, this is going to change with the introduction of
mirroring towards the CPU port, as the CPU port does not have a backing
netdev.

Avoid dereferencing the destination netdev when it is not clear if it is
valid or not.
