selftests/livepatch: simplify test-klp-callbacks busy target tests

The test-klp-callbacks script includes a few tests which rely on kernel
task timings that may not always execute as expected under system load.
These may generate out of sequence kernel log messages that result in
test failure.

Instead of using sleep timing windows to orchestrate these tests, add a
block_transition module parameter to communicate the test purpose and
utilize flush_queue() to serialize the test module's task output.
