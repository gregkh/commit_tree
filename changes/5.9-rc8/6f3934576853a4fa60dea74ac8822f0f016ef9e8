net: ipv6: Use struct_size() helper and kcalloc()

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes. Also, remove unnecessary
function ipv6_rpl_srh_alloc_size() and replace kzalloc() with kcalloc(),
which has a 2-factor argument form for multiplication.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and
fixed manually.
