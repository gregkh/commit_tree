selftests/x86: Add a syscall_arg_fault_64 test for negative GSBASE

If the kernel erroneously allows WRGSBASE and user code writes a
negative value, paranoid_entry will get confused. Check for this by
writing a negative value to GSBASE and doing SYSENTER with TF set. A
successful run looks like:

    [RUN]	SYSENTER with TF, invalid state, and GSBASE < 0
    [SKIP]	Illegal instruction

A failed run causes a kernel hang, and I believe it's because we
double-fault and then get a never ending series of page faults and,
when we exhaust the double fault stack we double fault again,
starting the process over.
