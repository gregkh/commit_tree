dt-bindings: leds: cznic,turris-omnia-leds: fix error in binding

There is a bug in the device tree binding for cznic,turris-omnia-leds
which causes make dt_binding_check to complain.

The reason is that the multi-led property binding's regular expression
does not contain the `@` character, while the example nodes do.

Fix this, and also adjust the maximum address to 'b' as there are 12
LEDs.
