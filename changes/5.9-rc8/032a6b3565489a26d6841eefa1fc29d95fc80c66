bpf: Rename bpf_htab to bpf_shtab in sock_map

There are two different `struct bpf_htab` in bpf code in the following
files:
- kernel/bpf/hashtab.c
- net/core/sock_map.c

It makes it impossible to find proper btf_id by name = "bpf_htab" and
kind = BTF_KIND_STRUCT what is needed to support access to map ptr so
that bpf program can access `struct bpf_htab` fields.

To make it possible one of the struct-s should be renamed, sock_map.c
looks like a better candidate for rename since it's specialized version
of hashtab.

Rename it to bpf_shtab ("sh" stands for Sock Hash).
