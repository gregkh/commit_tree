samples: bpf: Refactor BPF map in map test with libbpf

From commit 646f02ffdd49 ("libbpf: Add BTF-defined map-in-map
support"), a way to define internal map in BTF-defined map has been
added.

Instead of using previous 'inner_map_idx' definition, the structure to
be used for the inner map can be directly defined using array directive.

    __array(values, struct inner_map)

This commit refactors map in map test program with libbpf by explicitly
defining inner map with BTF-defined format.
