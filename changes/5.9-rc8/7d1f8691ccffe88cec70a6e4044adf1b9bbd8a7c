Revert "KVM: Check the allocation of pv cpu mask"

The commit 0f990222108d ("KVM: Check the allocation of pv cpu mask") we
have in 5.9-rc5 has two issue:
1) Compilation fails for !CONFIG_SMP, see:
   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209285

2) This commit completely disables PV TLB flush, see
   https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/87y2lrnnyf.fsf@vitty.brq.redhat.com/

The allocation problem is likely a theoretical one, if we don't
have memory that early in boot process we're likely doomed anyway.
Let's solve it properly later.

This reverts commit 0f990222108d214a0924d920e6095b58107d7b59.
