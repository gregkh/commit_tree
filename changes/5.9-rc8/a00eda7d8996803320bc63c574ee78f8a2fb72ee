drm/i915: Move sseu debugfs under gt/

In line with what happened for other gt-related features, move the sseu
debugfs files under gt/.

The sseu_status debugfs has also been kept at the top level as we do
have tests that use it; it will be removed once we teach the tests to
look into the new path.
