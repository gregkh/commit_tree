iio:adc:mcp3422: remove CONFIG_OF and of_match_ptr protections

They stop the driver being used with ACPI PRP0001 and are something
I want to avoid being cut and paste into new drivers.
Also switch the include from of.h to mod_devicetable.h as we
struct of_device_id is defined in there and we don't use anything
actually in of.h.
