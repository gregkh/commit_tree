cifs`: handle ERRBaduid for SMB1

If server returns ERRBaduid but does not reset transport connection,
we'll keep sending command with a non-valid UID for the server as long
as transport is healthy, without actually recovering. This have been
observed on the field.

This patch adds ERRBaduid handling so that we set CifsNeedReconnect.

map_and_check_smb_error() can be modified to extend use cases.
