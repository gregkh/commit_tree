libnvdimm: Validate command family indices

The ND_CMD_CALL format allows for a general passthrough of passlisted
commands targeting a given command set. However there is no validation
of the family index relative to what the bus supports.

- Update the NFIT bus implementation (the only one that supports
  ND_CMD_CALL passthrough) to also passlist the valid set of command
  family indices.

- Update the generic __nd_ioctl() path to validate that field on behalf
  of all implementations.
