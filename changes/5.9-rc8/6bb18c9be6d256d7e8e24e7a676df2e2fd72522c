drm/ast: Init cursors before creating modesetting structures

The cursor helpers reserve buffer objects in VRAM and update their
content. So although tied to modesetting, cursor helpers are more
of a memory manager. The modesetting's cursor plane requires this
functionality, so initialize cursors before modesetting.

While at it, also add an error check for ast_cursor_init().
