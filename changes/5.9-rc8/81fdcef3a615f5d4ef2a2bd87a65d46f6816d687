regulator: lp87565: enable voltage regardless of ENx pin

This driver enables outputs by setting bit EN_BUCKn in the BUCKn_CTRL1
register. However, if bit EN_PIN_CTRLn in the same register is set, the
output is actually enabled only if EN_BUCKn is set AND an enable pin is
active. Since the driver does not touch EN_PIN_CTRLn, the choice is left to
the hardware, which in turn gets this bit from OTP memory, and in absence
of OTP data it uses a default value that is documented in the datasheet for
LP8752x, but not for LP8756x.

Thus the driver doesn't really "know" whether it is actually enabling the
output or not.

In order to make sure activation is always driver-controlled, just clear
the EN_PIN_CTRLn bit. Now all activation solely depend on the EN_BUCKn bit.
