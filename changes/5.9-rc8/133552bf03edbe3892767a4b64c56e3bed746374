phy: Remove CONFIG_ARCH_* check for related subdir in Makefile

If CONFIG_ARCH_ROCKCHIP is not set but COMPILE_TEST is set, the file in
the subdir rockchip can not be built due to CONFIG_ARCH_ROCKCHIP check
in drivers/phy/Makefile.

Since the related configs in drivers/phy/rockchip/Kconfig depend on
ARCH_ROCKCHIP, so remove CONFIG_ARCH_ROCKCHIP check for subdir rockchip
in drivers/phy/Makefile.

The other CONFIG_ARCH_* about allwinner, amlogic, mediatek, renesas and
tegra have the same situation, so remove them too.
