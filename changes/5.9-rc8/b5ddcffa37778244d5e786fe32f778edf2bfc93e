btrfs: fix put of uninitialized kobject after seed device delete

The following test case leads to NULL kobject free error:

  mount seed /mnt
  add sprout to /mnt
  umount /mnt
  mount sprout to /mnt
  delete seed

  kobject: '(null)' (00000000dd2b87e4): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.

This is because, at the end of the seed device-delete, we try to remove
the seed's devid sysfs entry. But for the seed devices under the sprout
fs, we don't initialize the devid kobject yet. So add a kobject state
check, which takes care of the bug.
