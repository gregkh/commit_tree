clocksource/drivers/ingenic: Add high resolution timer support for SMP/SMT.

Enable clock event handling on per CPU core basis. Make sure that
interrupts raised on the first core execute event handlers on the
correct CPU core. This driver is required by Ingenic processors
that support SMP/SMT, such as JZ4780 and X2000.
