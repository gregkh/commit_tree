NFSv4.2: add client side xattr caching.

Implement client side caching for NFSv4.2 extended attributes. The cache
is a per-inode hashtable, with name/value entries. There is one special
entry for the listxattr cache.

NFS inodes have a pointer to a cache structure. The cache structure is
allocated on demand, freed when the cache is invalidated.

Memory shrinkers keep the size in check. Large entries (> PAGE_SIZE)
are collected by a separate shrinker, and freed more aggressively
than others.
