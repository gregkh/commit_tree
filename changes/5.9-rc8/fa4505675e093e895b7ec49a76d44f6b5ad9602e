selftests/bpf: Fix massive output from test_maps

When stdout output from the selftests tool 'test_maps' gets redirected
into e.g file or pipe, then the output lines increase a lot (from 21
to 33949 lines).  This is caused by the printf that happens before the
fork() call, and there are user-space buffered printf data that seems
to be duplicated into the forked process.

To fix this fflush() stdout before the fork loop in __run_parallel().
