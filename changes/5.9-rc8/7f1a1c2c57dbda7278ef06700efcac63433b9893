dt-bindings: arm: coresight: Add support to skip trace unit power up

Add "qcom,skip-power-up" property to identify systems which can
skip powering up of trace unit since they share the same power
domain as their CPU core. This is required to identify such
systems with hardware errata which stops the CPU watchdog counter
when the power up bit is set (TRCPDCR.PU).
