cpufreq: Register governors at core_initcall

Currently, most CPUFreq governors are registered at the core_initcall
time when the given governor is the default one, and the module_init
time otherwise.

In preparation for letting users specify the default governor on the
kernel command line, change all of them to be registered at the
core_initcall unconditionally, as it is already the case for the
schedutil and performance governors. This will allow us to assume
that builtin governors have been registered before the built-in
CPUFreq drivers probe.

And since all governors have similar init/exit patterns now, introduce
two new macros, cpufreq_governor_{init,exit}(), to factorize the code.
