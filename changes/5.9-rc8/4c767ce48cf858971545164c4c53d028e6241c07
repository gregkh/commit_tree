thunderbolt: Ensure left shift of 512 does not overflow a 32 bit int

The 32 bit int value 512 is being left shifted and then used in a context
that expects the expression to be a larger unsigned long. There may be
a potential integer overflow, so make 512 a UL before shift to avoid
any such issues.
