zonefs: add zone-capacity support

In the zoned storage model, the sectors within a zone are typically all
writeable. With the introduction of the Zoned Namespace (ZNS) Command
Set in the NVM Express organization, the model was extended to have a
specific writeable capacity.

This zone capacity can be less than the overall zone size for a NVMe ZNS
device or null_blk in zoned-mode. For other ZBC/ZAC devices the zone
capacity is always equal to the zone size.

Use the zone capacity field instead from blk_zone for determining the
maximum inode size and inode blocks in zonefs.
