ext4: add inline encryption support

Wire up ext4 to support inline encryption via the helper functions which
fs/crypto/ now provides.  This includes:

- Adding a mount option 'inlinecrypt' which enables inline encryption
  on encrypted files where it can be used.

- Setting the bio_crypt_ctx on bios that will be submitted to an
  inline-encrypted file.

  Note: submit_bh_wbc() in fs/buffer.c also needed to be patched for
  this part, since ext4 sometimes uses ll_rw_block() on file data.

- Not adding logically discontiguous data to bios that will be submitted
  to an inline-encrypted file.

- Not doing filesystem-layer crypto on inline-encrypted files.
