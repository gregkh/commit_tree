net: mscc: ocelot: fix race condition with TX timestamping

The TX-timestampable skb is added late to the ocelot_port->tx_skbs. It
is in a race with the TX timestamp IRQ, which checks that queue trying
to match the timestamp with the skb by the ts_id. The skb should be
added to the queue before the IRQ can fire.
