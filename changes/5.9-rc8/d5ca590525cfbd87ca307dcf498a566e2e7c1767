selftests/bpf: Fix silent Makefile output

99aacebecb75 ("selftests: do not use .ONESHELL") removed .ONESHELL, which
changes how Makefile "silences" multi-command target recipes. selftests/bpf's
Makefile relied (a somewhat unknowingly) on .ONESHELL behavior of silencing
all commands within the recipe if the first command contains @ symbol.
Removing .ONESHELL exposed this hack.

This patch fixes the issue by explicitly silencing each command with $(Q).

Also explicitly define fallback rule for building *.o from *.c, instead of
relying on non-silent inherited rule. This was causing a non-silent output for
bench.o object file.
