spi: altera: support indirect access to the registers

This patch adds support for indirect access to the registers via parent
regmap.

The use case is, the spi master is a sub device of a Multifunction
device, which is connected to host by some indirect bus. To support this
device type, a new platform_device_id is introduced, and the driver tries
to get parent regmap for register accessing like many MFD sub device
drivers do.
