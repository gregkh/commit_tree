x86: Add support for ZSTD compressed kernel

- Add support for zstd compressed kernel

- Define __DISABLE_EXPORTS in Makefile

- Remove __DISABLE_EXPORTS definition from kaslr.c

- Bump the heap size for zstd.

- Update the documentation.

Integrates the ZSTD decompression code to the x86 pre-boot code.

Zstandard requires slightly more memory during the kernel decompression
on x86 (192 KB vs 64 KB), and the memory usage is independent of the
window size.

__DISABLE_EXPORTS is now defined in the Makefile, which covers both
the existing use in kaslr.c, and the use needed by the zstd decompressor
in misc.c.

This patch has been boot tested with both a zstd and gzip compressed
kernel on i386 and x86_64 using buildroot and QEMU.

Additionally, this has been tested in production on x86_64 devices.
We saw a 2 second boot time reduction by switching kernel compression
from xz to zstd.
