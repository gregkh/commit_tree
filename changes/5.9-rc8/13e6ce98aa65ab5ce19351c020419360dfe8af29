net: sched: only keep the available bits when setting vxlan md->gbp

As we can see from vxlan_build/parse_gbp_hdr(), when processing metadata
on vxlan rx/tx path, only dont_learn/policy_applied/policy_id fields can
be set to or parse from the packet for vxlan gbp option.

So we'd better do the mask when set it in act_tunnel_key and cls_flower.
Otherwise, when users don't know these bits, they may configure with a
value which can never be matched.
