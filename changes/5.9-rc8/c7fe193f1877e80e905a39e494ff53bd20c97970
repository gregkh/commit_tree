fs/dax: Remove unused size parameter

Passing size to copy_user_dax implies it can copy variable sizes of data
when in fact it calls copy_user_page() which is exactly a page.

We are safe because the only caller uses PAGE_SIZE anyway so just remove
the variable for clarity.

While we are at it change copy_user_dax() to copy_cow_page_dax() to make
it clear it is a singleton helper for this one case not implementing
what dax_iomap_actor() does.
