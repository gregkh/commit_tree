firmware: tegra: Add support for in-band debug

Add support for retrieving BPMP debug information via in-band messaging
as opposed to using shared-memory which older BPMP firmware used. Note
that it is possible to detect at runtime whether the BPMP firmware being
used supports the in-band messaging for retrieving the debug
informaation. Therefore, if the BPMP firmware supports the in-band
messaging for debug use this and otherwise fall-back to using shared
memory.
