scripts/gdb: fix python 3.8 SyntaxWarning

Fixes the observed warnings:
scripts/gdb/linux/rbtree.py:20: SyntaxWarning: "is" with a literal. Did
you mean "=="?
  if node is 0:
scripts/gdb/linux/rbtree.py:36: SyntaxWarning: "is" with a literal. Did
you mean "=="?
  if node is 0:

Fixes: commit 449ca0c95ea2 ("scripts/gdb: add rb tree iterating utilities")
