spi: spi-geni-qcom: Set an autosuspend delay of 250 ms

In commit 0e3b8a81f5df ("spi: spi-geni-qcom: Add interconnect
support") the spi_geni_runtime_suspend() and spi_geni_runtime_resume()
became a bit slower.  Measuring on my hardware I see numbers in the
hundreds of microseconds now.

Let's use autosuspend to help avoid some of the overhead.  Now if
we're doing a bunch of transfers we won't need to be constantly
chruning.

The number 250 ms for the autosuspend delay was picked a bit
arbitrarily, so if someone has measurements showing a better value we
could easily change this.
