fs/minix: fix block limit check for V1 filesystems

The minix filesystem reads its maximum file size from its on-disk
superblock.  This value isn't necessarily a multiple of the block size.
When it's not, the V1 block mapping code doesn't allow mapping the last
possible block.  Commit 6ed6a722f9ab ("minixfs: fix block limit check")
fixed this in the V2 mapping code.  Fix it in the V1 mapping code too.
