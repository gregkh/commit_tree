tools/bpf: build: Make sure resolve_btfids cleans up after itself

The new resolve_btfids tool did not clean up the feature detection folder
on 'make clean', and also was not called properly from the clean rule in
tools/make/ folder on its 'make clean'. This lead to stale objects being
left around, which could cause feature detection to fail on subsequent
builds.
