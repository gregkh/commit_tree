perf bench numa: Use numa_node_to_cpus() to bind tasks to nodes

It is currently assumed that each node contains at most nr_cpus/nr_nodes
CPUs and nodes' CPU ranges do not overlap.

That assumption is generally incorrect as there are archs where a CPU
number does not depend on to its node number.

This update removes the described assumption by simply calling
numa_node_to_cpus() interface and using the returned mask for binding
CPUs to nodes.

Also, variable types and names made consistent in functions using
cpumask.
