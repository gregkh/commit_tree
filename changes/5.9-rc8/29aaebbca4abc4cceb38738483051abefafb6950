iommu/vt-d: Handle 36bit addressing for x86-32

Beware that the address size for x86-32 may exceed unsigned long.

[    0.368971] UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/iommu/intel/iommu.c:128:14
[    0.369055] shift exponent 36 is too large for 32-bit type 'long unsigned int'

If we don't handle the wide addresses, the pages are mismapped and the
device read/writes go astray, detected as DMAR faults and leading to
device failure. The behaviour changed (from working to broken) in commit
fa954e683178 ("iommu/vt-d: Delegate the dma domain to upper layer"), but
the error looks older.
