cpufreq: powernow-k8: Mark 'hi' and 'lo' dummy variables as __always_unused

if we fail to use a variable, even a dummy ones, then the compiler
complains that it is set but not used.  We know this is fine, so we
set them as __always_unused here to let the compiler know.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c: In function ‘pending_bit_stuck’:
 drivers/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c:89:10: warning: variable ‘hi’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 89 | u32 lo, hi;
 | ^~
 drivers/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c: In function ‘core_voltage_pre_transition’:
 drivers/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c:285:14: warning: variable ‘lo’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 285 | u32 maxvid, lo, rvomult = 1;
 | ^~
