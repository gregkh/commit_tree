bpf: Use dedicated bpf_trace_printk event instead of trace_printk()

The bpf helper bpf_trace_printk() uses trace_printk() under the hood.
This leads to an alarming warning message originating from trace
buffer allocation which occurs the first time a program using
bpf_trace_printk() is loaded.

We can instead create a trace event for bpf_trace_printk() and enable
it in-kernel when/if we encounter a program using the
bpf_trace_printk() helper.  With this approach, trace_printk()
is not used directly and no warning message appears.
