MIPS: only register FTLBPar exception handler for supported models

Previously ExcCode 16 is unconditionally treated as the FTLB parity
exception (FTLBPar), but in fact its semantic is implementation-
dependent. Looking at various manuals it seems the FTLBPar exception is
only present on some recent MIPS Technologies cores, so only register
the handler on these.
