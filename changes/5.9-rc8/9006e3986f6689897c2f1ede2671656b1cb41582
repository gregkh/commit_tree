scsi: ufs-mediatek: Do not gate clocks if auto-hibern8 is not entered yet

There is a chance that link enters hibern8 via auto-hibern8 scheme during
the clock-gating flow. Clocks shall not be gated if link is still active
otherwise host or device may hang.

Fix this by returning error code to the caller __ufshcd_setup_clocks() to
skip gating clocks there if link is not confirmed in hibern8 state yet.

Also allow some waiting time for the hibern8 state transition.
