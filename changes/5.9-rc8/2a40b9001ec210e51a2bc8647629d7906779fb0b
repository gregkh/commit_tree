KVM: x86: Pull the PGD's level from the MMU instead of recalculating it

Use the shadow_root_level from the current MMU as the root level for the
PGD, i.e. for VMX's EPTP.  This eliminates the weird dependency between
VMX and the MMU where both must independently calculate the same root
level for things to work correctly.  Temporarily keep VMX's calculation
of the level and use it to WARN if the incoming level diverges.

Opportunistically refactor kvm_mmu_load_pgd() to avoid indentation hell,
and rename a 'cr3' param in the load_mmu_pgd prototype that managed to
survive the cr3 purge.

No functional change intended.
