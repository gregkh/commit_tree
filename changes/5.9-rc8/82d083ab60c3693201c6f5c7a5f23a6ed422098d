kprobes: tracing/kprobes: Fix to kill kprobes on initmem after boot

Since kprobe_event= cmdline option allows user to put kprobes on the
functions in initmem, kprobe has to make such probes gone after boot.
Currently the probes on the init functions in modules will be handled
by module callback, but the kernel init text isn't handled.
Without this, kprobes may access non-exist text area to disable or
remove it.
