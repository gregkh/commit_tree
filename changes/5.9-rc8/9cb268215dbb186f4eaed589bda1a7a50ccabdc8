drm/amdgpu: Fix NULL dereference in dpm sysfs handlers

NULL dereference occurs when string that is not ended with space or
newline is written to some dpm sysfs interface (for example pp_dpm_sclk).
This happens because strsep replaces the tmp with NULL if the delimiter
is not present in string, which is then dereferenced by tmp[0].

Reproduction example:
sudo sh -c 'echo -n 1 > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_sclk'
