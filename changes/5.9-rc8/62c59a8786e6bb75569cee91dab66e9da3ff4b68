memstick: Skip allocating card when removing host

After commit 6827ca573c03 ("memstick: rtsx_usb_ms: Support runtime power
management"), removing module rtsx_usb_ms will be stuck.

The deadlock is caused by powering on and powering off at the same time,
the former one is when memstick_check() is flushed, and the later is called
by memstick_remove_host().

Soe let's skip allocating card to prevent this issue.
