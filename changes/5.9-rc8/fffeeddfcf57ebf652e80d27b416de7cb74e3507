i40e: detect and log info about pre-recovery mode

Detect and log information about pre-recovery mode when firmware
transitions to a recovery mode.
When a firmware transitions to a recovery mode it stores a number
of unexpected EMP resets in one of its registers. The number of EMP
resets ranging from 0x21 to 0x2A indicates that FW transitions
to recovery mode. Use these values to emit log entry about transition
process. Previously the pre-recovery mode may not have been detected
and there was no log entry when NIC was in pre-recovery mode.
