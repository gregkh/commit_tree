drm/of: Make drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() to check graph's presence

When graph isn't defined in a device-tree, the of_graph_get_remote_node()
prints a noisy error message, telling that port node is not found. This is
undesirable behaviour in our case because absence of a panel/bridge graph
is a valid case. Let's check the graph's presence in a device-tree before
proceeding with parsing of the graph.
