USB: serial: ch341: name prescaler, divisor registers

Add constants for the prescaler and divisor registers. Document and
name register 0x25, and put the LCR define to more use.

The 0x25 register (CH341_REG_LCR2) is only used by CH341 chips before
version 0x30 and is involved in configuring the line control parameters.
It's not known to the author whether there any such chips in the wild,
and Linux' ch341 driver never supported them. For chip version 0x30 and
above the 0x25 register is always set to zero. The alternative would've
been to not set the register at all, but that may have unintended
effects.
