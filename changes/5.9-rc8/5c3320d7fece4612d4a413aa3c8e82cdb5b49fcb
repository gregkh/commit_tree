libbpf: Fix memory leak and optimize BTF sanitization

Coverity's static analysis helpfully reported a memory leak introduced by
0f0e55d8247c ("libbpf: Improve BTF sanitization handling"). While fixing it,
I realized that btf__new() already creates a memory copy, so there is no need
to do this. So this patch also fixes misleading btf__new() signature to make
data into a `const void *` input parameter. And it avoids unnecessary memory
allocation and copy in BTF sanitization code altogether.
