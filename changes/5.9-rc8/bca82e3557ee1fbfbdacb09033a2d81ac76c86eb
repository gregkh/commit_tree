media: i2c: imx214: select V4L2_FWNODE

After the recent conversion of the media build infrastructure to select
V4L2 components instead of depending on their presence, which took place
in:
32a363d0b0b14 ("media: Kconfig files: use select for V4L2 subdevs and MC")

imx214 stands out as being the (only?) media I2C driver that still depends
on a V4L2 core symbol instead of selecting it.

This confuses the build system which claims it has detected a circular
dependency when other drivers select the same symbol as the imx214
driver does.

drivers/media/i2c/Kconfig:728:error: recursive dependency detected!
drivers/media/i2c/Kconfig:728:	symbol VIDEO_IMX214 depends on V4L2_FWNODE
drivers/media/v4l2-core/Kconfig:71:	symbol V4L2_FWNODE is selected by VIDEO_BCM2835_UNICAM
drivers/media/platform/bcm2835/Kconfig:3:	symbol VIDEO_BCM2835_UNICAM depends on VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API
drivers/media/v4l2-core/Kconfig:19:	symbol VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API depends on MEDIA_CONTROLLER
drivers/media/Kconfig:168:	symbol MEDIA_CONTROLLER is selected by VIDEO_IMX214

Fix this by making the imx214 driver select V4L2_FWNODE instead of
depending on it and align it with all the other drivers.
