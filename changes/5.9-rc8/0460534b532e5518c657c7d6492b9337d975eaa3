powerpc/papr_scm: Limit the readability of 'perf_stats' sysfs attribute

The newly introduced 'perf_stats' attribute uses the default access
mode of 0444, allowing non-root users to access performance stats of
an nvdimm and potentially force the kernel into issuing a large number
of expensive hypercalls. Since the information exposed by this
attribute cannot be cached it is better to ward off access to this
attribute from users who don't need to access to these performance
statistics.

Hence update the access mode of 'perf_stats' attribute to be only
readable by root users.
