x86/kvm: Use generic xfer to guest work function

Use the generic infrastructure to check for and handle pending work before
transitioning into guest mode.

This now handles TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME as well which was ignored so
far. Handling it is important as this covers task work and task work will
be used to offload the heavy lifting of POSIX CPU timers to thread context.
