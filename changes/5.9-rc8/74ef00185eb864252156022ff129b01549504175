btrfs: introduce "rescue=" mount option

This patch introduces a new "rescue=" mount option group for all mount
options for data recovery.

Different rescue sub options are seperated by ':'. E.g
"ro,rescue=nologreplay:usebackuproot".

The original plan was to use ';', but ';' needs to be escaped/quoted,
or it will be interpreted by bash, similar to '|'.

And obviously, user can specify rescue options one by one like:
"ro,rescue=nologreplay,rescue=usebackuproot".

The following mount options are converted to "rescue=", old mount
options are deprecated but still available for compatibility purpose:

- usebackuproot
  Now it's "rescue=usebackuproot"

- nologreplay
  Now it's "rescue=nologreplay"
