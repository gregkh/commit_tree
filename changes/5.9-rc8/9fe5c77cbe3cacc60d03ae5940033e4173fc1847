xfs: mark log recovery buffers for completion

Log recovery has it's own buffer write completion handler for
buffers that it directly recovers. Convert these to direct calls by
flagging these buffers as being log recovery buffers. The flag will
get cleared by the log recovery IO completion routine, so it will
never leak out of log recovery.
