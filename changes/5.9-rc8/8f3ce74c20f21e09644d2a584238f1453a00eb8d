coresight: replicator: Reset replicator if context is lost

On some QCOM SoCs, replicators in Always-On domain loses its
context as soon as the clock is disabled. Currently as a part
of pm_runtime workqueue, clock is disabled after the replicator
is initialized by amba_pm_runtime_suspend assuming that context
is not lost which is not true for replicators with such
limitations. So add a new property "qcom,replicator-loses-context"
to identify such replicators and reset them.
