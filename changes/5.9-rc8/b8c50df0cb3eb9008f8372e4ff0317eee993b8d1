selftests/bpf: test_progs avoid minus shell exit codes

There are a number of places in test_progs that use minus-1 as the argument
to exit(). This is confusing as a process exit status is masked to be a
number between 0 and 255 as defined in man exit(3). Thus, users will see
status 255 instead of minus-1.

This patch use positive exit code 3 instead of minus-1. These cases are put
in the same group of infrastructure setup errors.
