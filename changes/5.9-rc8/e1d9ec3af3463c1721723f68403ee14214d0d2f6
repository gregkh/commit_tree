fpga: dfl: Use struct_size() in kzalloc()

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes. Also, remove unnecessary
function dfl_feature_platform_data_size().

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and
fixed manually.
