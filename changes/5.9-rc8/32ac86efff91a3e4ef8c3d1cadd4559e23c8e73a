fs/minix: set s_maxbytes correctly

The minix filesystem leaves super_block::s_maxbytes at MAX_NON_LFS rather
than setting it to the actual filesystem-specific limit.  This is broken
because it means userspace doesn't see the standard behavior like getting
EFBIG and SIGXFSZ when exceeding the maximum file size.

Fix this by setting s_maxbytes correctly.
