net: mscc: ocelot: split writes to pause frame enable bit and to thresholds

We don't want ocelot_port_set_maxlen to enable pause frame TX, just to
adjust the pause thresholds.

Move the unconditional enabling of pause TX to ocelot_init_port. There
is no good place to put such setting because it shouldn't be
unconditional. But at the moment it is, we're not changing that.
