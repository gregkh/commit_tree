arm64: defconfig: Enable additional support for Renesas platforms

Increase build and test coverage by enabling support for more hardware
present on Renesas SoCs and boards:
  - Renesas Gigabit Ethernet Controller on R-Car V3H, as used on the
    Condor and V3HSK boards,
  - Sony IMX219 and OmniVision OV5645 cameras, as used on the
    AISTARVISION MIPI Adapter V2.1,
  - Analog Devices ADV7511 HDMI audio, as used on various boards
    (Condor, Draak, Eagle, Ebisu, V3HSK, and V3MSK).

All of the above are modular, except for Ethernet support (HDMI Audio
support is an optional feature of the modular ADV7511 driver).
