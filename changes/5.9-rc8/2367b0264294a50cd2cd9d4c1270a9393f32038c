m68k: Optimize cc-option calls for cpuflags-y

arch/m68k/Makefile computes lots of unneeded cc-option calls.

For example, if CONFIG_M5441x is not defined, there is not point in
evaluating the following compiler flag.

 cpuflags-$(CONFIG_M5441x)      := $(call cc-option,-mcpu=54455,-mcfv4e)

The result is set to cpuflags-, then thrown away.

The right hand side of ':=' is immediately expanded. Hence, all of the
16 calls for cc-option are evaluated. This is expensive since cc-option
invokes the compiler. This occurs even if you are not attempting to
build anything, like 'make ARCH=m68k help'.

Use '=' to expand the value _lazily_. The evaluation for cc-option is
delayed until $(cpuflags-y) is expanded. So, the cc-option test happens
just once at most.

This commit mimics tune-y of arch/arm/Makefile.
