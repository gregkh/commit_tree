nvme-fc: fail new connections to a deleted host or remote port

The lldd may have made calls to delete a remote port or local port and
the delete is in progress when the cli then attempts to create a new
controller. Currently, this proceeds without error although it can't be
very successful.

Fix this by validating that both the host port and remote port are
present when a new controller is to be created.
