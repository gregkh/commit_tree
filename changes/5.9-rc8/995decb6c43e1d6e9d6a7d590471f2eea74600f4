KVM: x86: take as_id into account when checking PGD

OVMF booted guest running on shadow pages crashes on TRIPLE FAULT after
enabling paging from SMM. The crash is triggered from mmu_check_root() and
is caused by kvm_is_visible_gfn() searching through memslots with as_id = 0
while vCPU may be in a different context (address space).

Introduce kvm_vcpu_is_visible_gfn() and use it from mmu_check_root().
