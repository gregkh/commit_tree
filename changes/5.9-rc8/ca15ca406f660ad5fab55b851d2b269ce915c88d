mm: remove unneeded includes of <asm/pgalloc.h>

Patch series "mm: cleanup usage of <asm/pgalloc.h>"

Most architectures have very similar versions of pXd_alloc_one() and
pXd_free_one() for intermediate levels of page table.  These patches add
generic versions of these functions in <asm-generic/pgalloc.h> and enable
use of the generic functions where appropriate.

In addition, functions declared and defined in <asm/pgalloc.h> headers are
used mostly by core mm and early mm initialization in arch and there is no
actual reason to have the <asm/pgalloc.h> included all over the place.
The first patch in this series removes unneeded includes of
<asm/pgalloc.h>

In the end it didn't work out as neatly as I hoped and moving
pXd_alloc_track() definitions to <asm-generic/pgalloc.h> would require
unnecessary changes to arches that have custom page table allocations, so
I've decided to move lib/ioremap.c to mm/ and make pgalloc-track.h local
to mm/.

This patch (of 8):

In most cases <asm/pgalloc.h> header is required only for allocations of
page table memory.  Most of the .c files that include that header do not
use symbols declared in <asm/pgalloc.h> and do not require that header.

As for the other header files that used to include <asm/pgalloc.h>, it is
possible to move that include into the .c file that actually uses symbols
from <asm/pgalloc.h> and drop the include from the header file.

The process was somewhat automated using

	sed -i -E '/[<"]asm\/pgalloc\.h/d' \
                $(grep -L -w -f /tmp/xx \
                        $(git grep -E -l '[<"]asm/pgalloc\.h'))

where /tmp/xx contains all the symbols defined in
arch/*/include/asm/pgalloc.h.
