fsnotify: create method handle_inode_event() in fsnotify_operations

The method handle_event() grew a lot of complexity due to the design of
fanotify and merging of ignore masks.

Most backends do not care about this complex functionality, so we can hide
this complexity from them.

Introduce a method handle_inode_event() that serves those backends and
passes a single inode mark and less arguments.

This change converts all backends except fanotify and inotify to use the
simplified handle_inode_event() method.  In pricipal, inotify could have
also used the new method, but that would require passing more arguments
on the simple helper (data, data_type, cookie), so we leave it with the
handle_event() method.
