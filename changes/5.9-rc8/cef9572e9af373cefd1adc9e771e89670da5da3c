watchdog: add support for adjusting last known HW keepalive time

Certain watchdogs require the watchdog only to be pinged within a
specific time window, pinging too early or too late cause the watchdog
to fire. In cases where this sort of watchdog has been started before
kernel comes up, we must adjust the watchdog keepalive window to match
the actually running timer, so add a new driver API for this purpose.
