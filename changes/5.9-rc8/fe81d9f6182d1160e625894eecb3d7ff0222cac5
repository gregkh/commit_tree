net: sctp: Fix IPv6 ancestor_size calc in sctp_copy_descendant

When calculating ancestor_size with IPv6 enabled, simply using
sizeof(struct ipv6_pinfo) doesn't account for extra bytes needed for
alignment in the struct sctp6_sock. On x86, there aren't any extra
bytes, but on ARM the ipv6_pinfo structure is aligned on an 8-byte
boundary so there were 4 pad bytes that were omitted from the
ancestor_size calculation.  This would lead to corruption of the
pd_lobby pointers, causing an oops when trying to free the sctp
structure on socket close.
