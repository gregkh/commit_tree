kexec_file: Allow archs to handle special regions while locating memory hole

Some architectures may have special memory regions, within the given
memory range, which can't be used for the buffer in a kexec segment.
Implement weak arch_kexec_locate_mem_hole() definition which arch code
may override, to take care of special regions, while trying to locate
a memory hole.

Also, add the missing declarations for arch overridable functions and
and drop the __weak descriptors in the declarations to avoid non-weak
definitions from becoming weak.
