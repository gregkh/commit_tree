drm/cma-helper: Add DRM_GEM_CMA_DRIVER_OPS to set default GEM CMA functions

The macro to DRM_GEM_CMA_DRIVER_OPS sets GEM callbacks in struct drm_driver
to their defaults for CMA. A variant of the macro is provided for drivers
that override the default .dumb_create callback. Adapt drivers to the changes.

v4:
	* remove parenthesis around dumb_create_func
	* fix grammar in commit message
