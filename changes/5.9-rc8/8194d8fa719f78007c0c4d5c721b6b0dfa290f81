net: mscc: ocelot: fix some key offsets for IP4_TCP_UDP VCAP IS2 entries

The IS2 IP4_TCP_UDP key offsets do not correspond to the VSC7514
datasheet. Whether they work or not is unknown to me. On VSC9959 and
VSC9953, with the same mistake and same discrepancy from the
documentation, tc-flower src_port and dst_port rules did not work, so I
am assuming the same is true here.
