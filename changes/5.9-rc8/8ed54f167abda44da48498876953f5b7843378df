ip_tunnel_core: Fix build for archs without _HAVE_ARCH_IPV6_CSUM

On architectures defining _HAVE_ARCH_IPV6_CSUM, we get
csum_ipv6_magic() defined by means of arch checksum.h headers. On
other architectures, we actually need to include net/ip6_checksum.h
to be able to use it.

Without this include, building with defconfig breaks at least for
s390.
