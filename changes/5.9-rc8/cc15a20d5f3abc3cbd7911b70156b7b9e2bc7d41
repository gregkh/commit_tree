selftests/bpf: Add test for resolve_btfids

Adding resolve_btfids test under test_progs suite.

It's possible to use btf_ids.h header and its logic in
user space application, so we can add easy test for it.

The test defines BTF_ID_LIST and checks it gets properly
resolved.

For this reason the test_progs binary (and other binaries
that use TRUNNER* macros) is processed with resolve_btfids
tool, which resolves BTF IDs in .BTF_ids section. The BTF
data are taken from btf_data.o object rceated from
progs/btf_data.c.
