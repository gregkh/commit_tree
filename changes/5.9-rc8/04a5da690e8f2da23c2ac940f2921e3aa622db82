NFSv4.2: define limits and sizes for user xattr handling

Set limits for extended attributes (attribute value size and listxattr
buffer size), based on the fs-independent limits (XATTR_*_MAX).

Define the maximum XDR sizes for the RFC 8276 XATTR operations.
In the case of operations that carry a larger payload (SETXATTR,
GETXATTR, LISTXATTR), these exclude that payload, which is added
as separate pages, like other operations do.

Define, much like for read and write operations, the maximum overhead
sizes for get/set/listxattr, and use them to limit the maximum payload
size for those operations, in combination with the channel attributes.
