KVM: x86/mmu: Drop kvm_arch_write_log_dirty() wrapper

Drop kvm_arch_write_log_dirty() in favor of invoking .write_log_dirty()
directly from FNAME(update_accessed_dirty_bits).  "kvm_arch" is usually
used for x86 functions that are invoked from generic KVM, and implies
that there are external callers, neither of which is true.

Remove the check for a non-NULL kvm_x86_ops hook as the call is wrapped
in PTTYPE_EPT and is unconditionally set by VMX.
