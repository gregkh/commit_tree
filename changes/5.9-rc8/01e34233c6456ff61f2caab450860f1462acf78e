ath11k: fix wmi peer flags in peer assoc command

Currently need ptk/gtk wmi peer flags in wmi peer assoc cmd
are set based on the rsnie and wpaie of the bss from the bss list.
Since this bss list is not updated with current BSSID for AP mode,
we may not find bss from the bss list. Which results in ptk/gtk peer
flags are not set in the wmi peer assoc cmd. Due to this EAPOL frames
are going in data rates instead of management rates.
