bcache: add more accurate error information in read_super_common()

The improperly set bucket or block size will trigger error in
read_super_common(). For large bucket size, a more accurate error message
for invalid bucket or block size is necessary.

This patch disassembles the combined if() checks into multiple single
if() check, and provide more accurate error message for each check
failure condition.
