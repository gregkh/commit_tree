media: media/v4l2: remove V4L2_FLAG_MEMORY_NON_CONSISTENT flag

The patch partially reverts some of the UAPI bits of the buffer
cache management hints. Namely, the queue consistency (memory
coherency) user-space hint because, as it turned out, the kernel
implementation of this feature was misusing DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT.

The patch reverts both kernel and user space parts: removes the
DMA consistency attr functions, rolls back changes to v4l2_requestbuffers,
v4l2_create_buffers structures and corresponding UAPI functions
(plus compat32 layer) and cleans up the documentation.
