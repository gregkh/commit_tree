platform/chrome: cros_ec_ishtp: Fix a double-unlock issue

In function cros_ec_ishtp_probe(), "up_write" is already called
before function "cros_ec_dev_init". But "up_write" will be called
again after the calling of the function "cros_ec_dev_init" failed.
Thus add a call of the function “down_write” in this if branch
for the completion of the exception handling.
