m68k: mac: Fix IOP status/control register writes

When writing values to the IOP status/control register make sure those
values do not have any extraneous bits that will clear interrupt flags.

To place the SCC IOP into bypass mode would be desirable but this is not
achieved by writing IOP_DMAINACTIVE | IOP_RUN | IOP_AUTOINC | IOP_BYPASS
to the control register. Drop this ineffective register write.

Remove the flawed and unused iop_bypass() function. Make use of the
unused iop_stop() function.
