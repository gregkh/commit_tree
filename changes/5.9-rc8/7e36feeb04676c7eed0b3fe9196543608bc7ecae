net/mlx5e: CT: Don't offload tuple rewrites for established tuples

Next patches will remove the tupleid registers that is used
to restore the ct state on miss, and instead use the tuple on
the missed packet to lookup which state to restore.
Disable tuple rewrites after connection tracking.

For tuple rewrites, inject a ct_state=-trk match so it won't
change the tuple for established flows (+trk) that passed connection
tracking, and instead miss to software.
