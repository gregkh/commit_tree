net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix napi sync and possible use-after-free

Using synchronize_rcu() is sufficient to wait until running NAPI quits.

See similar upstream fix with detailed explanation:
("net/mlx5e: Use synchronize_rcu to sync with NAPI")

This change also fixes a possible use-after-free as the NAPI
might be already released at this stage.
