i2c: algo: pca: Reapply i2c bus settings after reset

If something goes wrong (such as the SCL being stuck low) then we need
to reset the PCA chip. The issue with this is that on reset we lose all
config settings and the chip ends up in a disabled state which results
in a lock up/high CPU usage. We need to re-apply any configuration that
had previously been set and re-enable the chip.
