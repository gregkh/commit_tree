ASoC: meson: cards: deal dpcm flag change

Commit b73287f0b074 ("ASoC: soc-pcm: dpcm: fix playback/capture checks")
changed the meaning of dpcm_playback/dpcm_capture and now requires the
CPU DAI BE to aligned with those flags.

This broke all Amlogic cards with uni-directional backends (All gx and
most axg cards).

While I'm still confused as to how this change is an improvement, those
cards can't remain broken forever. Hopefully, next time an API change is
done like that, all the users will be updated as part of the change, and
not left to fend for themselves.
