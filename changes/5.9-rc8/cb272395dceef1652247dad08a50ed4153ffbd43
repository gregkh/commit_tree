mtd: rawnand: qcom: set BAM mode only if not set already

BAM is DMA controller on QCOM ipq platforms, BAM mode on NAND driver
is set by writing BAM_MODE_EN bit on NAND_CTRL register.

NAND_CTRL is an operational register and in BAM mode operational
registers are read only.

So, before enabling BAM mode by writing the NAND_CTRL register, check
if BAM mode was already enabled by the bootloader, and enable BAM mode
only if it is not enabled already.
