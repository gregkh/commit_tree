timers: Spare timer softirq until next expiry

Now that the core timer infrastructure doesn't depend anymore on
periodic base->clk increments, even when the CPU is not in NO_HZ mode,
timer softirqs can be skipped until there are timers to expire.

Some spurious softirqs can still remain since base->next_expiry doesn't
keep track of canceled timers but this still reduces the number of softirqs
significantly: ~15 times less for HZ=1000 and ~5 times less for HZ=100.
