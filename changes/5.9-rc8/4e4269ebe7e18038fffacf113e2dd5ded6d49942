hinic: bump up the timeout of SET_FUNC_STATE cmd

We free memory regardless of the return value of SET_FUNC_STATE
cmd in hinic_close function to avoid memory leak and this cmd may
timeout when fw is busy with handling other cmds, so we bump up the
timeout of this cmd to ensure it won't return failure.
