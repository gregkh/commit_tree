powerpc: Drop old comment about CONFIG_POWER

There's a comment in time.h referring to CONFIG_POWER, which doesn't
exist. That confuses scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py.

Presumably the comment was referring to a CONFIG_POWER vs CONFIG_PPC,
in which case for CONFIG_POWER we would #define __USE_RTC to 1. But
instead we have CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_601, and these days we have
IS_ENABLED().

So the comment is no longer relevant, drop it.
