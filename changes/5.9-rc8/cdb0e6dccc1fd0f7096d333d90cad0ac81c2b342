enetc: Fix mdio bus removal on PF probe bailout

This is the correct resolution for the conflict from
merging the "net" tree fix:
commit 26cb7085c898 ("enetc: Remove the mdio bus on PF probe bailout")
with the "net-next" new work:
commit 07095c025ac2 ("net: enetc: Use DT protocol information to set up the ports")
that moved mdio bus allocation to an ealier stage of
the PF probing routine.
