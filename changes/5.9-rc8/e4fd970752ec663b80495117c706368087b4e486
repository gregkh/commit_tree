dt-bindings: interrupt-controller: Convert mti,gic to DT schema

Modern device tree bindings are supposed to be created as YAML-files
in accordance with DT schema. This commit replaces MIPS GIC legacy bare
text binding with YAML file. As before the binding file states that the
corresponding dts node is supposed to be compatible with MIPS Global
Interrupt Controller indicated by the "mti,gic" compatible string and
to provide a mandatory interrupt-controller and '#interrupt-cells'
properties. There might be optional registers memory range,
"mti,reserved-cpu-vectors" and "mti,reserved-ipi-vectors" properties
specified.

MIPS GIC also includes a free-running global timer, per-CPU count/compare
timers, and a watchdog. Since currently the GIC Timer is only supported the
DT schema expects an IRQ and clock-phandler charged timer sub-node with
"mti,mips-gic-timer" compatible string.
