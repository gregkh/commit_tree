tracepoint: Mark __tracepoint_string's __used

__tracepoint_string's have their string data stored in .rodata, and an
address to that data stored in the "__tracepoint_str" section. Functions
that refer to those strings refer to the symbol of the address. Compiler
optimization can replace those address references with references
directly to the string data. If the address doesn't appear to have other
uses, then it appears dead to the compiler and is removed. This can
break the /tracing/printk_formats sysfs node which iterates the
addresses stored in the "__tracepoint_str" section.

Like other strings stored in custom sections in this header, mark these
__used to inform the compiler that there are other non-obvious users of
the address, so they should still be emitted.
