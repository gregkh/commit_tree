platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: ignore unnecessary wakeups on old ECs

ECs that don't implement EC_CMD_HOST_EVENT_GET_WAKE_MASK should still
have some reasonable default mask -- otherwise, they'll treat a variety
of EC signals as spurious wakeups. Battery and AC events can be
especially common, for devices that have been sitting at full charge
plugged into AC for a long time, as they may cycle their charging off
and on, or their battery may start reporting failures as it ages.

Treating these as wakeups does not serve a useful purpose, and is
instead often counterproductive. And indeed, later ECs (that implement
the mask) don't include these events in their wake-mask.

Note that this patch doesn't do anything without the subsequent patch
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: check for missing
EC_CMD_HOST_EVENT_GET_WAKE_MASK"), because
cros_ec_get_host_event_wake_mask() currently does not return an error if
EC_CMD_HOST_EVENT_GET_WAKE_MASK is not implemented.

Some additional notes:
While the EC typically knows not to wake the CPU for these unimportant
events once the CPU reaches a sleep state, it doesn't really have a way
to know that the CPU is "almost" asleep, unless it has support for
EC_CMD_HOST_SLEEP_EVENT. Alas, these older ECs do not support that
command either, so this solution is not 100% complete.
