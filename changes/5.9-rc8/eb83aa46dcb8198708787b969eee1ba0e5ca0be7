ARM: dts: motorola-mapphone-common: remove unneeded "simple-graph-card"

Audio Graph Card is using "audio-graph-card" prefix instead of
"simple-graph-card", and moreover "widgets / routing" doesn't need it.
This patch removes unsupported "simple-graph-card" prefix from
motorola-mapphone-common.dtsi and vendor-prefixes.yaml.
