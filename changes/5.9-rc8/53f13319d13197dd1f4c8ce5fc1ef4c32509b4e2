thunderbolt: Get rid of E2E workaround

The end-to-end (E2E) workaround is needed for Falcon Ridge (TBT 2)
controller when E2E is enabled for both ends of the host-to-host
connection. However, we never supported full E2E in the first place so
this code is not necessary at the moment. Further this allows us to use
all available rings for data except ring 0 which is reserved for the
control path.

The complete E2E flow control is explained in the USB4 spec so we may
add it back later if needed but at least the networking driver seems to
work fine without, and the higher level stack, like TCP will retransmit
lost packets anyway.
