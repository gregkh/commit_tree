fanotify: use FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD as implicit flag on sb/mount/non-dir marks

Up to now, fanotify allowed to set the FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD flag on
sb/mount marks and non-directory inode mask, but the flag was ignored.

Mask out the flag if it is provided by user on sb/mount/non-dir marks
and define it as an implicit flag that cannot be removed by user.

This flag is going to be used internally to request for events with
parent and name info.
