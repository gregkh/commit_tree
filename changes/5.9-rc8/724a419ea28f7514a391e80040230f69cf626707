HID: microsoft: Add rumble support for the 8bitdo SN30 Pro+ controller

When operating in XInput mode, the 8bitdo SN30 Pro+ requires the same
quirk as the official Xbox One Bluetooth controllers for rumble to
function.

Other controllers like the N30 Pro 2, SF30 Pro, SN30 Pro, etc. probably
also need this quirk, but I do not have the hardware to test.
