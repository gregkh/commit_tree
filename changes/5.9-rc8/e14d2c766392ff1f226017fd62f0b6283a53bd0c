ARM: dts: am335x-pocketbeagle: add gpio-line-names

The BeagleBoard.org PocketBeagle has P1 and P2 headers [0] which expose
many of the TI AM3358 SoC balls to stacking expansion boards called
"capes", or to other external connections like jumper wires connected
to a breadboard.

Note: the AM3358 die is actually embedded inside of the OSD335x-SM
System-in-Package (SiP) [1] but that is irrelevant to the gpio driver.

Many of the P1 and P2 header pins can muxed to a GPIO line.  The
gpio-line-names describe which P1 or P2 pin that line goes to and the
default mux for that P1 or P2 pin if it is not GPIO.

Some GPIO lines are named "[NC]" as the corresponding balls are not
routed to anything on the PCB.

The goal for these names is to make it easier for a user viewing the
output of gpioinfo to determine which P1 or P2 pin is connected to a
GPIO line.  The output of gpioinfo on a PocketBeagle would be:
