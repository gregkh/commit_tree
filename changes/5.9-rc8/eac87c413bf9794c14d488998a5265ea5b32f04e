net: openvswitch: reorder masks array based on usage

This patch reorders the masks array every 4 seconds based on their
usage count. This greatly reduces the masks per packet hit, and
hence the overall performance. Especially in the OVS/OVN case for
OpenShift.

Here are some results from the OVS/OVN OpenShift test, which use
8 pods, each pod having 512 uperf connections, each connection
sends a 64-byte request and gets a 1024-byte response (TCP).
All uperf clients are on 1 worker node while all uperf servers are
on the other worker node.

Kernel without this patch     :  7.71 Gbps
Kernel with this patch applied: 14.52 Gbps

We also run some tests to verify the rebalance activity does not
lower the flow insertion rate, which does not.
