ktest.pl: Always show log file location if defined even on success

If a log file is defined and the test were to error, a print statement is
made that shows the user where the log file is to examine it further. But
this is not done if the test were to succeed.

I find it annoying that it does not show where the log file is on success,
as I run several different tests that place their log files in various
locations, and even though the test pass, there's things I want to look at
in the log file (like warnings). It is much easier to find where the log
file is, if it is displayed at the end of a test.
