PCI: Set bridge map_irq and swizzle_irq to default functions

The majority of DT based host drivers use the default .map_irq() and
.swizzle_irq() functions, so let's initialize the function pointers to
the default and drop setting them in the host drivers.

Drivers like iProc which don't support legacy interrupts need to set
.map_irq() back to NULL.
