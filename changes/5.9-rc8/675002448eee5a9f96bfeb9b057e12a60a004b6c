gpio: zynq: Add Versal support

Add Versal support in gpio.
Only bank 0 and 3 are connected to the Multiplexed Input output pins.
Bank 0 to mio and bank3 to fabric Multiplexed input output pins.

Versal devices are the industry's first adaptive compute
acceleration platforms.

On the Versal platform, we are using two customized GPIO controllers(IP)
which were used in Zynq/ZynqMp platform.
One of them present in the Platform Management Controller(PMC) block and
other in Processing System(PS) block.

In PMC_GPIO only Bank0,1,3 & 4 are enabled and in PS_GPIO only
Bank 0 & 3 are enabled.

You can find more details of GPIO IP in ZynqMP TRM General Purpose
I/O(Chapter-27).
