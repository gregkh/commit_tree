crypto: caam/qi2 - create ahash shared descriptors only once

For keyed hash algorithms, shared descriptors are currently generated
twice:
-at tfm initialization time, in cra_init() callback
-in setkey() callback

Since it's mandatory to call setkey() for keyed algorithms, drop the
generation in cra_init().

This is similar to the change in caamhash (caam/jr top-level library)
