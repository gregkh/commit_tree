media: rockchip: rga: Only set output CSC mode for RGB input

Setting the output CSC mode is required for a YUV output, but must not
be set when the input is also YUV. Doing this (as tested with a YUV420P
to YUV420P conversion) results in wrong colors.

Adapt the logic to only set the output CSC mode when the output is YUV and
the input is RGB. Also add a comment to clarify the rationale.
