net: sched: sch_red: Split init and change callbacks

In the following patches, RED will get two qevents. The implementation will
be clearer if the callback for change is not a pure subset of the callback
for init. Split the two and promote attribute parsing to the callbacks
themselves from the common code, because it will be handy there.
