i40e: fix return of uninitialized aq_ret in i40e_set_vsi_promisc

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_virtchnl_pf.c: In function ‘i40e_set_vsi_promisc’:
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_virtchnl_pf.c:1176:14: error: ‘aq_ret’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  i40e_status aq_ret;

In case the code inside the if statement and the for loop does not get
executed aq_ret will be uninitialized when the variable gets returned at
the end of the function.

Avoid this by changing num_vlans from int to u16, so aq_ret always gets
set. Making this change in additional places as num_vlans should never
be negative.
