f2fs: avoid readahead race condition

If two readahead threads having same offset enter in readpages, every read
IOs are split and issued to the disk which giving lower bandwidth.

This patch tries to avoid redundant readahead calls.

Fixes one build error reported by Randy.
Fix build error when F2FS_FS_COMPRESSION is not set/enabled.
This label is needed in either case.

../fs/f2fs/data.c: In function ‘f2fs_mpage_readpages’:
../fs/f2fs/data.c:2327:5: error: label ‘next_page’ used but not defined
     goto next_page;
