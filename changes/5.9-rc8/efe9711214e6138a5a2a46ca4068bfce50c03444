cpuidle: change enter_s2idle() prototype

Control Flow Integrity(CFI) is a security mechanism that disallows
changes to the original control flow graph of a compiled binary,
making it significantly harder to perform such attacks.

init_state_node() assign same function callback to different
function pointer declarations.

static int init_state_node(struct cpuidle_state *idle_state,
                           const struct of_device_id *matches,
                           struct device_node *state_node) { ...
        idle_state->enter = match_id->data; ...
        idle_state->enter_s2idle = match_id->data; }

Function declarations:

struct cpuidle_state { ...
        int (*enter) (struct cpuidle_device *dev,
                      struct cpuidle_driver *drv,
                      int index);

        void (*enter_s2idle) (struct cpuidle_device *dev,
                              struct cpuidle_driver *drv,
                              int index); };

In this case, either enter() or enter_s2idle() would cause CFI check
failed since they use same callee.

Align function prototype of enter() since it needs return value for
some use cases. The return value of enter_s2idle() is no
need currently.
