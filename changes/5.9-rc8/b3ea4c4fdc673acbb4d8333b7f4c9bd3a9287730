net/mlx5e: Change reporters create functions to return void

Creation of devlink health reporters is not fatal for mlx5e instance load.
In case of error in reporter's creation, the return value is ignored.
Change all reporters creation functions to return void.

In addition, with this change, a failure in creating a reporter, will not
prevent the driver from trying to create the next reporter in the list.
