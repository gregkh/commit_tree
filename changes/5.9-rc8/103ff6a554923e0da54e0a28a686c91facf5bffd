fanotify: generalize merge logic of events on dir

An event on directory should never be merged with an event on
non-directory regardless of the event struct type.

This change has no visible effect, because currently, with struct
fanotify_path_event, the relevant events will not be merged because
event path of dir will be different than event path of non-dir.
