ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_rt5672: Improve dai-set-fmt comment in cht_codec_fixup()

As Pierre-Louis Bossart pointed out, saying that the default mode for the
SSP is TDM 4 slot is not entirely accurate.

There really are 2 default modes:
The default mode for the SSP configuration is TDM 4 slot for the
cpu-dai (hard-coded in DSP firmware),
The default mode for the SSP configuration is I2S for the codec-dai
(hard-coded in the 'SSP2-Codec" .dai_fmt masks, so far unused).

This commit updates the comment in cht_codec_fixup() to properly reflect
this.
