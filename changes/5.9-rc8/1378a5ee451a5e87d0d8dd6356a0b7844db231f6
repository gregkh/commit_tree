mm: store compound_nr as well as compound_order

Patch series "THP prep patches".

These are some generic cleanups and improvements, which I would like
merged into mmotm soon.  The first one should be a performance improvement
for all users of compound pages, and the others are aimed at getting code
to compile away when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is disabled (ie small
systems).  Also better documented / less confusing than the current prefix
mixture of compound, hpage and thp.

This patch (of 7):

This removes a few instructions from functions which need to know how many
pages are in a compound page.  The storage used is either page->mapping on
64-bit or page->index on 32-bit.  Both of these are fine to overlay on
tail pages.
