rapidio: Replace 'select' DMAENGINES 'with depends on'

Enabling a whole subsystem from a single driver 'select' is frowned
upon and won't be accepted in new drivers, that need to use 'depends on'
instead. Existing selection of DMAENGINES will then cause circular
dependencies. Replace them with a dependency.
