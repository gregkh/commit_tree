ASoC: samsung: Add sound support for Midas boards

This patch adds support for voice and BT calls, along with standard
audio output via the speaker, earpiece, headphone jack, HDMI, and
any accessories compatible with Midas boards. This patch also supports
headphone/headset detection and headsets with inline buttons.

[s.nawrocki: removal of the clk API calls for CODEC MCLK, the jack data
 structure moved to struct midas_priv, coding style and typo fixes,
 conversion to new cpu/codec/dai-node binding]
