gpiolib: Fix line event handling in syscall compatible mode

The introduced line event handling ABI in the commit

  61f922db7221 ("gpio: userspace ABI for reading GPIO line events")

missed the fact that 64-bit kernel may serve for 32-bit applications.
In such case the very first check in the lineevent_read() will fail
due to alignment differences.

To workaround this introduce lineevent_get_size() helper which returns actual
size of the structure in user space.
