f2fs: shrink node_write lock coverage

- to avoid race between checkpoint and quota file writeback, it
just needs to hold read lock of node_write in writeback path.
- node_write lock has covered all LFS data write paths, it's not
necessary, we only need to hold node_write lock at write path of
quota file.

This refactors commit ca7f76e68074 ("f2fs: fix wrong discard space").
