net/vdpa: Use struct for set/get vq state

For now VQ state involves 16 bit available index value encoded in u64
variable. In the future it will be extended to contain more fields. Use
struct to contain the state, now containing only a single u16 for the
available index. In the future we can add fields to this struct.
