scsi: libsas: Check link status in ATA prereset()

libata currently attempts to reset even if the SATA disk is unplugged.  To
avoid the meaningless reset of a missing disk, libsas should report offline
status to libata. libata already provides a .prereset callback for this
purpose. This is called by ata_eh_reset() and can be used to influence
whether a reset attempt should be made.

Add sas_ata_preset callback to check status of phy and disk. If the disk is
already offline or phy is disabled, we return -ENOENT to libata to avoid
the reset.
