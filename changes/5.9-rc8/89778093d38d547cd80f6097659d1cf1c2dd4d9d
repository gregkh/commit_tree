drivers/acpi: Add new macro ACPI_DECLARE_SUBTABLE_PROBE_ENTRY

In an effort to enable -Wcast-function-type in the top-level Makefile to
support Control Flow Integrity builds, there are the need to remove all
the function callback casts.

To do this, create a new macro called ACPI_DECLARE_SUBTABLE_PROBE_ENTRY
to initialize the acpi_probe_entry struct using the probe_subtbl field
instead of the probe_table field. This is a previous work to be able to
modify the IRQCHIP_ACPI_DECLARE macro to use this new defined macro.

Even though these two commented fields are part of a union, this is
necessary to avoid function cast mismatches. That is, due to the
IRQCHIP_ACPI_DECLARE invocations use as last parameter a function with
the protoype "int (*func)(struct acpi_subtable_header *, const unsigned
long)" it's necessary that this macro initialize the probe_subtbl field
of the acpi_probe_entry struct and not the probe_table field.
