ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirk for MPMAN Converter9 2-in-1

The MPMAN Converter9 2-in-1 almost fully works with out default settings.
The only problem is that it has only 1 speaker so any sounds only playing
on the right channel get lost.

Add a quirk for this model using the default settings + MONO_SPEAKER.
