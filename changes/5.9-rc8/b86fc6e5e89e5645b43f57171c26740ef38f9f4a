drm/i915: Don't set queue-priority hint when supressing the reschedule

We recorded the execlists->queue_priority_hint update for the inflight
request without kicking the tasklet. The next submitted request then
failed to be scheduled as it had a lower priority than the hint, leaving
the HW running with only the inflight request.
