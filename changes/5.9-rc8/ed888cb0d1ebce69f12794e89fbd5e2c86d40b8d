arm64: Allow CPUs unffected by ARM erratum 1418040 to come in late

Now that we allow CPUs affected by erratum 1418040 to come in late,
this prevents their unaffected sibblings from coming in late (or
coming back after a suspend or hotplug-off, which amounts to the
same thing).

To allow this, we need to add ARM64_CPUCAP_OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU,
which amounts to set .type to ARM64_CPUCAP_WEAK_LOCAL_CPU_FEATURE.
