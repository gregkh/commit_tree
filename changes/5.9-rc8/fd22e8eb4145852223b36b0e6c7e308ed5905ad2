media: rcar-vin: Invalidate pipeline if conversion is not possible on input formats

Up until now the VIN was capable to convert any of its supported input mbus
formats to any of it's supported output pixel formats. With the addition of
RAW formats this is no longer true.

This patch invalidates the pipeline by adding a check if given vin input
format can be converted to supported output pixel format.
