xhci: dbc: Pass dbc pointer to endpoint init and exit functions.

struct xhci_hcd pointer is not needed for dbc endpoint init and exit,
it was only used to get to the dbc structure.
Pass the dbc pointer as a parameter to these functions instead.

No functional changes
This change helps decoupling xhci and DbC
