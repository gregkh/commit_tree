net: mscc: ocelot: deinitialize only initialized ports

Currently mscc_ocelot_init_ports() will skip initializing a port when it
doesn't have a phy-handle, so the ocelot->ports[port] pointer will be
NULL. Take this into consideration when tearing down the driver, and add
a new function ocelot_deinit_port() to the switch library, mirror of
ocelot_init_port(), which needs to be called by the driver for all ports
it has initialized.
