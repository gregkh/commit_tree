lockdep: Complain only once about RCU in extended quiescent state

Currently, lockdep_rcu_suspicious() complains twice about RCU read-side
critical sections being invoked from within extended quiescent states,
for example:

	RCU used illegally from idle CPU!
	rcu_scheduler_active = 2, debug_locks = 1
	RCU used illegally from extended quiescent state!

This commit therefore saves a couple lines of code and one line of
console-log output by eliminating the first of these two complaints.
