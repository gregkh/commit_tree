memory: tegra: Add Tegra132 compatible string match

Ensure that the driver will bind against the Tegra132 instantiation of
the external memory controller. While the two are roughly the same from
a capability perspective, they do require some incompatible changes to
the programming sequences and therefore need separate compatible
strings.
