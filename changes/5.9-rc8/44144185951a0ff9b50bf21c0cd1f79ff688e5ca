hv_netvsc: Add validation for untrusted Hyper-V values

For additional robustness in the face of Hyper-V errors or malicious
behavior, validate all values that originate from packets that Hyper-V
has sent to the guest in the host-to-guest ring buffer. Ensure that
invalid values cannot cause indexing off the end of an array, or
subvert an existing validation via integer overflow. Ensure that
outgoing packets do not have any leftover guest memory that has not
been zeroed out.
