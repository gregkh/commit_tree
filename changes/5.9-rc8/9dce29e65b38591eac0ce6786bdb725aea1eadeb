ktest.pl: Have config-bisect save each config used in the bisect

When performing a automatic config bisect via ktest.pl, it is very useful to
have a copy of each of the bisects used. This way, if a bisect were to go
wrong, it is possible to retrace the steps and continue at the location
before the error was made.

The ktest.pl will make a copy of the good and bad configs, labeled as such,
as well as a number attached to it that represents the iteration of the
bisect. These files are saved in the ktest temp directory where it currently
stores the good and bad config files.
