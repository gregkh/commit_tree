bpf: Add support for forced LINK_DETACH command

Add LINK_DETACH command to force-detach bpf_link without destroying it. It has
the same behavior as auto-detaching of bpf_link due to cgroup dying for
bpf_cgroup_link or net_device being destroyed for bpf_xdp_link. In such case,
bpf_link is still a valid kernel object, but is defuncts and doesn't hold BPF
program attached to corresponding BPF hook. This functionality allows users
with enough access rights to manually force-detach attached bpf_link without
killing respective owner process.

This patch implements LINK_DETACH for cgroup, xdp, and netns links, mostly
re-using existing link release handling code.
