btrfs: fix messages after changing compression level by remount

Reported by Forza on IRC that remounting with compression options does
not reflect the change in level, or at least it does not appear to do so
according to the messages:

  mount -o compress=zstd:1 /dev/sda /mnt
  mount -o remount,compress=zstd:15 /mnt

does not print the change to the level to syslog:

  [   41.366060] BTRFS info (device vda): use zstd compression, level 1
  [   41.368254] BTRFS info (device vda): disk space caching is enabled
  [   41.390429] BTRFS info (device vda): disk space caching is enabled

What really happens is that the message is lost but the level is actualy
changed.

There's another weird output, if compression is reset to 'no':

  [   45.413776] BTRFS info (device vda): use no compression, level 4

To fix that, save the previous compression level and print the message
in that case too and use separate message for 'no' compression.
