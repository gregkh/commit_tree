Revert "tty: serial: add missing spin_lock_init for SiFive serial console"

This reverts commit 17b4efdf4e4867079012a48ca10d965fe9d68822.

There has been a quick fix against uninitialised lock revealed by
the commit f743061a85f5 ("serial: core: Initialise spin lock before use
in uart_configure_port()"). Since we have now better fix in serial core,
this may be safely reverted.
