powerpc/numa: stub out numa_update_cpu_topology()

Previous changes have removed the code which sets bits in
cpu_associativity_changes_mask and thus it is never modifed at
runtime. From this we can reason that numa_update_cpu_topology()
always returns 0 without doing anything. Remove the body of
numa_update_cpu_topology() and remove all code which becomes
unreachable as a result.
