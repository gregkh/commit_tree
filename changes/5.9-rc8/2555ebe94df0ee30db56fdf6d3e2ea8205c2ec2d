ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: add quirk override with kernel parameter

During the bring-up of new platforms, or to take care of specific
hardware reworks, it's useful to add a kernel parameter to override
the default DMI-based quirks.

For example, adding the following line in a .conf file in
/etc/modprobe.d/ will change the default quirk and log the changes if
dynamic debug is enabled.

options snd_soc_sof_sdw quirk=0x802

[  735.025785] sof_sdw sof_sdw: Overriding quirk 0x10 => 0x802
[  735.025787] sof_sdw sof_sdw: quirk realtek,jack-detect-source 2
[  735.025790] sof_sdw sof_sdw: quirk SOF_RT715_DAI_ID_FIX enabled

Tested on ICL RVP with add-on board instead of default codec.
