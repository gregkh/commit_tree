dm: Call proper helper to determine dax support

DM was calling generic_fsdax_supported() to determine whether a device
referenced in the DM table supports DAX. However this is a helper for "leaf" device drivers so that
they don't have to duplicate common generic checks. High level code
should call dax_supported() helper which that calls into appropriate
helper for the particular device. This problem manifested itself as
kernel messages:

dm-3: error: dax access failed (-95)

when lvm2-testsuite run in cases where a DM device was stacked on top of
another DM device.
