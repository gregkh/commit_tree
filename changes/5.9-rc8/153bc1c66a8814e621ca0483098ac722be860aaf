clk: at91: fix possible dead lock in new drivers

syscon_node_to_regmap() will make the created regmap get and enable the
first clock it can parse from the device tree. This clock is not needed to
access the registers and should not be enabled at that time.

Use device_node_to_regmap to resolve this as it looks up the regmap in
the same list but doesn't care about the clocks. This issue is detected
by lockdep when booting the sama5d3 with a device tree containing the
new clk bindings.

This fix already happened in 6956eb33abb5 ("clk: at91: fix possible
deadlock") for the drivers that had been migrated to the new clk binding
back then. This does the same for the new drivers as well.
