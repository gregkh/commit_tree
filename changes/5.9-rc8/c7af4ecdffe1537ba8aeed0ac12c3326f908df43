lib/bootconfig: Fix to remove tailing spaces after value

Fix to remove tailing spaces after value. If there is a space
after value, the bootconfig failed to remove it because it
applies strim() before replacing the delimiter with null.

For example,

foo = var    # comment

was parsed as below.

foo="var    "

but user will expect

foo="var"

This fixes it by applying strim() after removing the delimiter.
