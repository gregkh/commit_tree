nvmet: add passthru code to process commands

Add passthru command handling capability for the NVMeOF target and
export passthru APIs which are used to integrate passthru
code with nvmet-core.

The new file passthru.c handles passthru cmd parsing and execution.
In the passthru mode, we create a block layer request from the nvmet
request and map the data on to the block layer request.

Admin commands and features are on an allow list as there are a number
of each that don't make too much sense with passthrough. We use an
allow list such that new commands can be considered before being blindly
passed through. In both cases, vendor specific commands are always
allowed.

We also reject reservation IO commands as the underlying device cannot
differentiate between multiple hosts behind a fabric.
