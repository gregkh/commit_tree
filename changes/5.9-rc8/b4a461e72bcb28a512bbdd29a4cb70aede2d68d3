printk: Make linux/printk.h self-contained

As it stands if you include printk.h by itself it will fail to
compile because it requires definitions from ratelimit.h.  However,
simply including ratelimit.h from printk.h does not work due to
inclusion loops involving sched.h and kernel.h.

This patch solves this by moving bits from ratelimit.h into a new
header file which can then be included by printk.h without any
worries about header loops.

The build bot then revealed some intriguing failures arising out
of this patch.  On s390 there is an inclusion loop with asm/bug.h
and linux/kernel.h that triggers a compile failure, because kernel.h
will cause asm-generic/bug.h to be included before s390's own
asm/bug.h has finished processing.  This has been fixed by not
including kernel.h in arch/s390/include/asm/bug.h.
