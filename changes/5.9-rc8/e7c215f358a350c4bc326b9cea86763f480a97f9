firmware: arm_scmi: Add notification callbacks-registration

Add the core SCMI notifications callbacks-registration support: allow
users to register their own callbacks against the desired events.

Whenever a registration request is issued against a still non existent
event, mark such request as pending for later processing, in order to
account for possible late initializations of SCMI Protocols associated
to loadable drivers.
