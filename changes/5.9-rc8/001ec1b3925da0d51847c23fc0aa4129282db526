timers: Optimize _next_timer_interrupt() level iteration

If a level has a timer that expires before reaching the next level, there
is no need to iterate further.

The next level is reached when the 3 lower bits of the current level are
cleared. If the next event happens before/during that, the next levels
won't provide an earlier expiration.
