kill unused dump_fpu() instances

dump_fpu() is used only on the architectures that support elf
and have neither CORE_DUMP_USE_REGSET nor ELF_CORE_COPY_FPREGS
defined.

Currently that's csky, m68k, microblaze, nds32 and unicore32.  The rest
of the instances are dead code.

NB: THIS MUST GO AFTER ELF_FDPIC CONVERSION
