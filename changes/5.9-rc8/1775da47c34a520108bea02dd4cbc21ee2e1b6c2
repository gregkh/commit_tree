qed: fix the allocation of the chains with an external PBL

Dan reports static checker warning:

"The patch 9b6ee3cf95d3: "qed: sanitize PBL chains allocation" from Jul
23, 2020, leads to the following static checker warning:

This issue was introduced with commit c3a321b06a80 ("qed: simplify
initialization of the chains with an external PBL"), when
chain->pbl_sp.table_virt initialization was moved up to
qed_chain_init_params().
Fix it by initializing pbl_virt with an already filled chain struct field.
