9p: retrieve fid from file when file instance exist.

In the current setattr implementation in 9p, fid is always retrieved
from dentry no matter file instance exists or not. If so, there may be
some info related to opened file instance dropped. So it's better
to retrieve fid from file instance when it is passed to setattr.

for example:
fd=open("tmp", O_RDWR);
ftruncate(fd, 10);

The file context related with the fd will be lost as fid is always
retrieved from dentry, then the backend can't get the info of
file context. It is against the original intention of user and
may lead to bug.
