drm/vblank: Use spin_(un)lock_irq() in drm_crtc_vblank_reset()

All of the drivers in the kernel tree only call this from one of the
following contexts:

* drm_crtc_funcs->reset
* During initial module load

Since both of these contexts are guaranteed to have interrupts enabled
beforehand, there's no need to use the irqsave/irqrestore variants of
spin_(un)lock(). So, fix this to make the irq context of this function
more obvious.
