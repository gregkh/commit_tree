phy: qualcomm: fix setting of tx_deamp_3_5db when device property read fails

Currently when reading of the device property for "qcom,tx-deamp_3_5db"
fails the default is being assigned incorrectly to phy_dwc3->rx_eq. This
looks like a copy-n-paste error and in fact should be assigning the
default instead to phy_dwc3->tx_deamp_3_5db

Addresses-Coverity: ("Copy-paste error")
