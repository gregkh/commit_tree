test_firmware: Test platform fw loading on non-EFI systems

On non-EFI systems, it wasn't possible to test the platform firmware
loader because it will have never set "checked_fw" during __init.
Instead, allow the test code to override this check. Additionally split
the declarations into a private symbol namespace so there is greater
enforcement of the symbol visibility.
