powerpc/mm/book3s64: Skip 16G page reservation with radix

With hash translation, the hypervisor can hint the LPAR about 16GB contiguous range
via ibm,expected#pages. The kernel marks the range specified in the device tree
as reserved. Avoid doing this when using radix translation. Radix translation
only supports 1G gigantic hugepage and kernel can do the 1G gigantic hugepage
allocation via early memblock reservation. This can be done because with radix
translation pages are not required to be contiguous on the host.
