drm/cma-helper: Rework DRM_GEM_CMA_VMAP_DRIVER_OPS macro

Rename the macro to DRM_GEM_CMA_DRIVER_OPS_VMAP to align naming with
SHMEM helpers and drm_gem_cma_prime_import_sg_table_vmap(). An variant of
the macro is provided for drivers that override the default .dumb_create
callback. Adapt drivers to the changes.

v3:
	* rename macro to signal implicit vmap on imported buffers
v2:
	* provide DRM_GEM_CMA_DRIVER_OPS_WITH_DUMB_CREATE
