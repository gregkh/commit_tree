i2c: eg20t: Drop PCI wakeup calls from .suspend/.resume

The driver calls pci_enable_wake(...., false) in pch_i2c_suspend() as well
as pch_i2c_resume(). Either it should enable-wake the device in .suspend()
or should not invoke pci_enable_wake() at all.

Concluding that this driver doesn't support enable-wake and PCI core calls
pci_enable_wake(pci_dev, PCI_D0, false) during resume, drop it from
.suspend() and .resume().
