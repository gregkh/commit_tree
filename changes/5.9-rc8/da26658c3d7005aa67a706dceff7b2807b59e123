hv_netvsc: Cache the current data path to avoid duplicate call and message

The previous change "hv_netvsc: Switch the data path at the right time
during hibernation" adds the call of netvsc_vf_changed() upon
NETDEV_CHANGE, so it's necessary to avoid the duplicate call and message
when the VF is brought UP or DOWN.
