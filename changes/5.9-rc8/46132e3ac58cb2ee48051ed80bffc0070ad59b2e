sched: nohz: stop passing around unused "ticks" parameter.

The "ticks" parameter was added in commit 0f004f5a696a ("sched: Cure more
NO_HZ load average woes") since calc_global_nohz() was called and needed
the "ticks" argument.

But in commit c308b56b5398 ("sched: Fix nohz load accounting -- again!")
it became unused as the function calc_global_nohz() dropped using "ticks".

Fixes: c308b56b5398 ("sched: Fix nohz load accounting -- again!")
