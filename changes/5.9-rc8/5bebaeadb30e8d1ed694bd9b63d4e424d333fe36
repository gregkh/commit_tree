drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Implement lane reordering + polarity

The ti-sn65dsi86 MIPI DSI to eDP bridge chip supports arbitrary
remapping of eDP lanes and also polarity inversion.  Both of these
features have been described in the device tree bindings for the
device since the beginning but were never implemented in the driver.
Implement both of them.

Part of this change also allows you to (via the same device tree
bindings) specify to use fewer than the max number of DP lanes that
the panel reports.  This could be useful if your display supports more
lanes but only a few are hooked up on your board.
