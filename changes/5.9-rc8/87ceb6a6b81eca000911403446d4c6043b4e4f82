io_uring: drop 'ctx' ref on task work cancelation

If task_work ends up being marked for cancelation, we go through a
cancelation helper instead of the queue path. In converting task_work to
always hold a ctx reference, this path was missed. Make sure that
io_req_task_cancel() puts the reference that is being held against the
ctx.
