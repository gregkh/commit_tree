media: ti-vpe: cal: Decouple control handler from v4l2_device

To prepare for decoupling the v4l2_device from the cal_ctx, don't set
the control handler in the v4l2_device and expect the video node to use
it automatically, but set the video node control handler directly. This
requires adding the sensor subdev controls to the control handler
manually, as that operation was performed on the v4l2_device by
v4l2_device_register_subdev().
