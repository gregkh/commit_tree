ALSA: hda: Enable sync-write operation as default for all controllers

In the end we already enabled the sync-write mode for most of HD-audio
controllers including Intel, and it's no big merit to keep the async
write mode for the rest.  Let's make it as default and drop the
superfluous AZX_DCAPS_SYNC_WRITE bit flag.

Also, avoid to set the allow_bus_reset flag, which is a quite unstable
and hackish behavior that was needed only for some early platforms
(decades ago).  The straight fallback to the single cmd mode is more
robust.
