selftests/bpf: Add bpf_{update, delete}_map_elem in hashmap iter program

Added bpf_{updata,delete}_map_elem to the very map element the
iter program is visiting. Due to rcu protection, the visited map
elements, although stale, should still contain correct values.
  $ ./test_progs -n 4/18
  #4/18 bpf_hash_map:OK
  #4 bpf_iter:OK
  Summary: 1/1 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED
