gcov: add support for GCC 10.1

Using gcov to collect coverage data for kernels compiled with GCC 10.1
causes random malfunctions and kernel crashes.  This is the result of a
changed GCOV_COUNTERS value in GCC 10.1 that causes a mismatch between
the layout of the gcov_info structure created by GCC profiling code and
the related structure used by the kernel.

Fix this by updating the in-kernel GCOV_COUNTERS value.  Also re-enable
config GCOV_KERNEL for use with GCC 10.
