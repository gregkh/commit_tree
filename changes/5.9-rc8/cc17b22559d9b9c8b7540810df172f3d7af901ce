x86/kvm: don't forget to ACK async PF IRQ

Merge commit 26d05b368a5c0 ("Merge branch 'kvm-async-pf-int' into HEAD")
tried to adapt the new interrupt based async PF mechanism to the newly
introduced IDTENTRY magic but unfortunately it missed the fact that
DEFINE_IDTENTRY_SYSVEC() doesn't call ack_APIC_irq() on its own and
all DEFINE_IDTENTRY_SYSVEC() users have to call it manually.

As the result all multi-CPU KVM guest hang on boot when
KVM_FEATURE_ASYNC_PF_INT is present. The breakage went unnoticed because no
KVM userspace (e.g. QEMU) currently set it (and thus async PF mechanism
is currently disabled) but we're about to change that.
