KVM: arm64: Simplify PtrAuth alternative patching

We currently decide to execute the PtrAuth save/restore code based
on a set of branches that evaluate as (ARM64_HAS_ADDRESS_AUTH_ARCH ||
ARM64_HAS_ADDRESS_AUTH_IMP_DEF). This can be easily replaced by
a much simpler test as the ARM64_HAS_ADDRESS_AUTH capability is
exactly this expression.
