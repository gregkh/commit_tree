media: cec-adap.c: don't use flush_scheduled_work()

For some inexplicable reason I decided to call flush_scheduled_work()
instead of cancel_delayed_work_sync(). The problem with that is that
flush_scheduled_work() waits for *all* queued scheduled work to be
completed instead of just the work itself.

This can cause a deadlock if a CEC driver also schedules work that
takes the same lock. See the comments for flush_scheduled_work() in
linux/workqueue.h.

This is exactly what has been observed a few times.

This patch simply replaces flush_scheduled_work() by
cancel_delayed_work_sync().
