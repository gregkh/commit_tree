vhost-vdpa: fix backend feature ioctls

Commit 653055b9acd4 ("vhost-vdpa: support get/set backend features")
introduces two malfunction backend features ioctls:

1) the ioctls was blindly added to vring ioctl instead of vdpa device
   ioctl
2) vhost_set_backend_features() was called when dev mutex has already
   been held which will lead a deadlock

This patch fixes the above issues.
