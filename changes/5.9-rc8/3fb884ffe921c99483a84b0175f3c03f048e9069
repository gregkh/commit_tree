KVM: arm64: Do not try to map PUDs when they are folded into PMD

For the obscure cases where PMD and PUD are the same size
(64kB pages with 42bit VA, for example, which results in only
two levels of page tables), we can't map anything as a PUD,
because there is... erm... no PUD to speak of. Everything is
either a PMD or a PTE.

So let's only try and map a PUD when its size is different from
that of a PMD.
