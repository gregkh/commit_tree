btrfs: stop incremening log_batch for the log root tree when syncing log

We are incrementing the log_batch atomic counter of the root log tree but
we never use that counter, it's used only for the log trees of subvolume
roots. We started doing it when we moved the log_batch and log_write
counters from the global, per fs, btrfs_fs_info structure, into the
btrfs_root structure in commit 7237f1833601dc ("Btrfs: fix tree logs
parallel sync").

So just stop doing it for the log root tree and add a comment over the
field declaration so inform it's used only for log trees of subvolume
roots.

This patch is part of a series that has the following patches:

1/4 btrfs: only commit the delayed inode when doing a full fsync
2/4 btrfs: only commit delayed items at fsync if we are logging a directory
3/4 btrfs: stop incremening log_batch for the log root tree when syncing log
4/4 btrfs: remove no longer needed use of log_writers for the log root tree

After the entire patchset applied I saw about 12% decrease on max latency
reported by dbench. The test was done on a qemu vm, with 8 cores, 16Gb of
ram, using kvm and using a raw NVMe device directly (no intermediary fs on
the host). The test was invoked like the following:

  mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdk
  mount -o ssd -o nospace_cache /dev/sdk /mnt/sdk
  dbench -D /mnt/sdk -t 300 8
  umount /mnt/dsk
