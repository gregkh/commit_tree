mm: Introduce mm_struct.has_pinned

(Commit message majorly collected from Jason Gunthorpe)

Reduce the chance of false positive from page_maybe_dma_pinned() by
keeping track if the mm_struct has ever been used with pin_user_pages().
This allows cases that might drive up the page ref_count to avoid any
penalty from handling dma_pinned pages.

Future work is planned, to provide a more sophisticated solution, likely
to turn it into a real counter.  For now, make it atomic_t but use it as
a boolean for simplicity.
