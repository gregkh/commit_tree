ARM: dts: s5pv210: Correct BCM4329 bluetooth node

There are several issues with the bluetooth node - the wrong
compatible was used (because the bcm4329 compatible didn't exist
when the node was added), the max rate was incorrect (due to
limitations in the samsung TTY driver which have now been fixed),
the clocks were not assigned properly so some rates didn't work,
and the some pinctrl settings weren't explicitly set.  Fix all
of the above issues.

While we're at it, update from the deprecated host-wakeup-gpios
property to the host-wake interrupt.
