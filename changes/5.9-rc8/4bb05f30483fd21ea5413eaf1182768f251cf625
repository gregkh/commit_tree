KVM: SVM: Add a dedicated INVD intercept routine

The INVD instruction intercept performs emulation. Emulation can't be done
on an SEV guest because the guest memory is encrypted.

Provide a dedicated intercept routine for the INVD intercept. And since
the instruction is emulated as a NOP, just skip it instead.
