refperf: Provide module parameter to specify number of experiments

The current code uses the number of threads both to limit the number
of threads and to specify the number of experiments, but also varies
the number of threads as the experiments progress.  This commit takes
a different approach by adding an refperf.nruns module parameter that
specifies the number of experiments, and furthermore uses the same
number of threads for each experiment.
