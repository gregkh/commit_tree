mptcp: Track received DATA_FIN sequence number and add related helpers

Incoming DATA_FIN headers need to propagate the presence of the DATA_FIN
bit and the associated sequence number to the MPTCP layer, even when
arriving on a bare ACK that does not get added to the receive queue. Add
structure members to store the DATA_FIN information and helpers to set
and check those values.
