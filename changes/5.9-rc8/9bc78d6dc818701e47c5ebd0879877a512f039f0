drm: meson: dw-hdmi: Use dw_hdmi context to replace hack

The meson-dw-hdmi driver needs to access its own context from the
.mode_valid() operation. It currently gets it from the dev_private field
of the drm_device retrieved from the connector, which is a hack. Use the
private data passed to the .mode_valid() operation instead.
