USB: phy: fsl-usb: remove character device usage

No idea why this driver is using a char device node, statically
allocated, with no dynamic allocation or hook up with devtmpfs, along
with a reserverd major number, for "special" operations, not all of
which ever were implemented.

So just rip it out, as no one must be using it because no modern system
will ever actually create the /dev/ node it needs.
