staging: vchi: Get rid of struct vchi_instance_handle

The idea behind this was to create an opaque handle to struct
vchiq_instance. This can be achieved without creating a new type by
means of a forward declaration of struct vchiq_instance.

This saves us from a lot of useless casting and overall simplifies code.
