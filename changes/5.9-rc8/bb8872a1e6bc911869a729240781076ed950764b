tipc: fix using smp_processor_id() in preemptible

The 'this_cpu_ptr()' is used to obtain the AEAD key' TFM on the current
CPU for encryption, however the execution can be preemptible since it's
actually user-space context, so the 'using smp_processor_id() in
preemptible' has been observed.

We fix the issue by using the 'get/put_cpu_ptr()' API which consists of
a 'preempt_disable()' instead.
