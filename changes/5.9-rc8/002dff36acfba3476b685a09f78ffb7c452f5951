asm/rwonce: Don't pull <asm/barrier.h> into 'asm-generic/rwonce.h'

Now that 'smp_read_barrier_depends()' has gone the way of the Norwegian
Blue, drop the inclusion of <asm/barrier.h> in 'asm-generic/rwonce.h'.

This requires fixups to some architecture vdso headers which were
previously relying on 'asm/barrier.h' coming in via 'linux/compiler.h'.
