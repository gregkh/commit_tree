dt-bindings: mtd: update STM32 FMC2 NAND controller documentation

These bindings can be used on SOCs where the FMC2 NAND controller is
in standalone. In case that the FMC2 embeds 2 controllers (an external
bus controller and a raw NAND controller), the register base address,
the clock and the reset will be defined in the parent node.
