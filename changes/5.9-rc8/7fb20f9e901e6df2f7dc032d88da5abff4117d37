bpf, doc: Remove references to warning message when using bpf_trace_printk()

The BPF helper bpf_trace_printk() no longer uses trace_printk();
it is now triggers a dedicated trace event.  Hence the described
warning is no longer present, so remove the discussion of it as
it may confuse people.

Fixes: ac5a72ea5c89 ("bpf: Use dedicated bpf_trace_printk event instead of trace_printk()")
