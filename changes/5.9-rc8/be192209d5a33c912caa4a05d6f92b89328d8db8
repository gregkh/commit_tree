mtd: spi-nor: Add capability to disable flash quad mode

Previous we didn't provide a way to disable the flash's quad mode.
Which means we cannot do some cleanup works when to remove or
poweroff the flash, like what set 4-byte address mode does in
spi_nor_restore().

Add the capability to disable the flash quad mode, by introducing
an enable flag in the flash parameters quad_enable() hooks and
related functions.
