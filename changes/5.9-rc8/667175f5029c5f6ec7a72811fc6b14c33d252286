arm64: dts: renesas: Add HiHope RZ/G2N Rev2.0/3.0/4.0 board with idk-1110wr display

The HiHope RZ/G2N variants are advertised as compatible with panel
idk-1110wr from Advantech, however the panel isn't sold alongside the
board. New dts's, enabling the lvds node to get the panel to work with
all the HiHope RZ/G2N variants.
