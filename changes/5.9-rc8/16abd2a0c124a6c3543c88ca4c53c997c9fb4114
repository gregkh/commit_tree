NFSv4.2: fix client's attribute cache management for copy_file_range

After client is done with the COPY operation, it needs to invalidate
its pagecache (as it did no reading or writing of the data locally)
and it needs to invalidate it's attributes just like it would have
for a read on the source file and write on the destination file.

Once the linux server started giving out read delegations to
read+write opens, the destination file of the copy_file range
started having delegations and not doing syncup on close of the
file leading to xfstest failures for generic/430,431,432,433,565.

v2: changing cache_validity needs to be protected by the i_lock.
