net: dsa: microchip: look for phy-mode in port nodes

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/dsa.txt says that the phy-mode
property should be specified on port nodes. However, the microchip
drivers read it from the switch node.

Let the driver use the per-port property and fall back to the old
location with a warning.

Fix in-tree users.
