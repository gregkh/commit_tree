afs: Fix error handling in VL server rotation

The error handling in the VL server rotation in the case of there being no
contactable servers is not correct.  In such a case, the records of all the
servers in the list are scanned and the errors and abort codes are mapped
and prioritised and one error is chosen.  This is then forgotten and the
default error is used (EDESTADDRREQ).

Fix this by using the calculated error.

Also we need to note whether a server responded on one of its endpoints so
that we can priorise an error from an abort message over local and network
errors.
