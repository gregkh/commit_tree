powerpc/watchpoint: Set CPU_FTR_DAWR1 based on pa-features bit

As per the PAPR, bit 0 of byte 64 in pa-features property indicates
availability of 2nd DAWR registers. i.e. If this bit is set, 2nd
DAWR is present, otherwise not. Host generally uses "cpu-features",
which masks "pa-features". But "cpu-features" are still not used for
guests and thus this change is mostly applicable for guests only.
