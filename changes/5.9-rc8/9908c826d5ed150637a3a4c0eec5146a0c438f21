powerpc/perf: Add Power10 PMU feature to DT CPU features

Add Power10 feature function to DT CPU features, along with a Power10
specific init() to initialize PMU SPRs, sets the oprofile_cpu_type and
cpu_features. This will enable performance monitoring unit (PMU) for
Power10 in CPU features with "performance-monitor-power10".

For Power ISA v3.1, BHRB disable is controlled via Monitor Mode
Control Register A (MMCRA) bit, namely "BHRB Recording
Disable (BHRBRD)". This patch initializes MMCRA BHRBRD to disable BHRB
feature at boot for Power10.
