scsi: virtio-scsi: Correctly handle the case where all LUNs are unplugged

Commit 5ff843721467 ("scsi: virtio_scsi: unplug LUNs when events missed")
missed a corner case in which all the LUNs are unplugged at the same time.

In this case INQUIRY returns DID_BAD_TARGET. Detect this and unplug the
LUN.
