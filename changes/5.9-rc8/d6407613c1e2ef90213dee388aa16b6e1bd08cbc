Revert "usbip: Implement a match function to fix usbip"

This commit reverts commit 7a2f2974f265 ("usbip: Implement a match
function to fix usbip").

In summary, commit d5643d2249b2 ("USB: Fix device driver race")
inadvertently broke usbip functionality, which I resolved in an incorrect
manner by introducing a match function to usbip, usbip_match(), that
unconditionally returns true.

However, the usbip_match function, as is, causes usbip to take over
virtual devices used by syzkaller for USB fuzzing, which is a regression
reported by Andrey Konovalov.

Furthermore, in conjunction with the fix of another bug, handled by another
patch titled "usbcore/driver: Fix specific driver selection" in this patch
set, the usbip_match function causes unexpected USB subsystem behaviour
when the usbip_host driver is loaded. The unexpected behaviour can be
qualified as follows:
- If commit 41160802ab8e ("USB: Simplify USB ID table match") is included
  in the kernel, then all USB devices are bound to the usbip_host
  driver, which appears to the user as if all USB devices were
  disconnected.
- If the same commit (41160802ab8e) is not in the kernel (as is the case
  with v5.8.10) then all USB devices are re-probed and re-bound to their
  original device drivers, which appears to the user as a disconnection
  and re-connection of USB devices.

Please note that this commit will make usbip non-operational again,
until yet another patch in this patch set is merged, titled
"usbcore/driver: Accommodate usbip".
