EDAC/ghes: Clear scanned data on unload

Commit

  b972fdba8665 ("EDAC/ghes: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ghes_edac_register()")

didn't clear all the information from the scanned system and, more
specifically, left ghes_hw.num_dimms to its previous value. On a
second load (CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE=y), the driver would use
the leftover num_dimms value which is not 0 and thus the 0 check in
enumerate_dimms() will get bypassed and it would go directly to the
pointer deref:

  d = &hw->dimms[hw->num_dimms];

which is, of course, NULL:

  #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
  #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
  PGD 0 P4D 0
  Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP

  RIP: 0010:enumerate_dimms.cold+0x7b/0x375

Reset the whole ghes_hw on driver unregister so that no stale values are
used on a second system scan.
