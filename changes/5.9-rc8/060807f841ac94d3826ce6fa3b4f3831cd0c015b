mm, slub: make remaining slub_debug related attributes read-only

SLUB_DEBUG creates several files under /sys/kernel/slab/<cache>/ that can
be read to check if the respective debugging options are enabled for given
cache.  Some options, namely sanity_checks, trace, and failslab can be
also enabled and disabled at runtime by writing into the files.

The runtime toggling is racy.  Some options disable __CMPXCHG_DOUBLE when
enabled, which means that in case of concurrent allocations, some can
still use __CMPXCHG_DOUBLE and some not, leading to potential corruption.
The s->flags field is also not updated or checked atomically.  The
simplest solution is to remove the runtime toggling.  The extended
slub_debug boot parameter syntax introduced by earlier patch should allow
to fine-tune the debugging configuration during boot with same
granularity.
