kprobes: Add symbols for kprobe insn pages

Symbols are needed for tools to describe instruction addresses. Pages
allocated for kprobe's purposes need symbols to be created for them.
Add such symbols to be visible via /proc/kallsyms.

Note: kprobe insn pages are not used if ftrace is configured. To see the
effect of this patch, the kernel must be configured with:

	# CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER is not set
	CONFIG_KPROBES=y

and for optimised kprobes:

	CONFIG_OPTPROBES=y

Example on x86:

	# perf probe __schedule
	Added new event:
	  probe:__schedule     (on __schedule)
	# cat /proc/kallsyms | grep '\[__builtin__kprobes\]'
	ffffffffc00d4000 t kprobe_insn_page     [__builtin__kprobes]
	ffffffffc00d6000 t kprobe_optinsn_page  [__builtin__kprobes]

Note: This patch adds "__builtin__kprobes" as a module name in
/proc/kallsyms for symbols for pages allocated for kprobes' purposes, even
though "__builtin__kprobes" is not a module.
