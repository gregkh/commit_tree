cifs: reduce number of referral requests in DFS link lookups

When looking up the DFS cache with a referral path that has more than
two path components, and is a complete prefix of an existing cache
entry, do not request another referral and just return the matched
entry as specified in MS-DFSC 3.2.5.5 Receiving a Root Referral
Request or Link Referral Request.
