net: phy: Avoid NPD upon phy_detach() when driver is unbound

If we have unbound the PHY driver prior to calling phy_detach() (often
via phy_disconnect()) then we can cause a NULL pointer de-reference
accessing the driver owner member. The steps to reproduce are:

echo unimac-mdio-0:01 > /sys/class/net/eth0/phydev/driver/unbind
ip link set eth0 down
