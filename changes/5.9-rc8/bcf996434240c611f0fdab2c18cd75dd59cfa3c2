arm64/vdso: Restrict splitting VVAR VMA

Forbid splitting VVAR VMA resulting in a stricter ABI and reducing the
amount of corner-cases to consider while working further on VDSO time
namespace support.

As the offset from timens to VVAR page is computed compile-time, the pages
in VVAR should stay together and not being partically mremap()'ed.
