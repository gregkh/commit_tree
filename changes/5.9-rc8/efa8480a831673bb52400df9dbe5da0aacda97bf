fs: RWF_NOWAIT should imply IOCB_NOIO

With the change allowing read-ahead for IOCB_NOWAIT, we changed the
RWF_NOWAIT semantics of only doing cached reads. Since we know have
IOCB_NOIO to manage that specific side of it, just make RWF_NOWAIT
imply IOCB_NOIO as well to restore the previous behavior.

Fixes: 2e85abf053b9 ("mm: allow read-ahead with IOCB_NOWAIT set")
