scsi: lpfc: Fix initial FLOGI failure due to BBSCN not supported

Initial FLOGIs are failing with the following message:

 lpfc 0000:13:00.1: 1:(0):0820 FLOGI Failed (x300). BBCredit Not Supported

In a prior patch, the READ_SPARAM command was re-ordered to post after
CONFIG_LINK as the driver is expected to update the driver's copy of the
service parameters for the FLOGI payload. If the bb-credit recovery feature
is enabled, this is fine. But on adapters were bb-credit recovery isn't
enabled, it would cause the FLOGI to fail.

Fix by restoring the original command order (READ_SPARAM before
CONFIG_LINK), and after issuing CONFIG_LINK, detect bb-credit recovery
support and reissuing READ_SPARAM to obtain the updated service parameters
(effectively adding in the fix command order).

[mkp: corrected SHA]
