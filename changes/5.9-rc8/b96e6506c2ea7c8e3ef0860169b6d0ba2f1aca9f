KVM: x86: VMX: Make smaller physical guest address space support user-configurable

This patch exposes allow_smaller_maxphyaddr to the user as a module parameter.
Since smaller physical address spaces are only supported on VMX, the
parameter is only exposed in the kvm_intel module.

For now disable support by default, and let the user decide if they want
to enable it.

Modifications to VMX page fault and EPT violation handling will depend
on whether that parameter is enabled.
