gpiolib: cdev: remove recalculation of offset

Remove recalculation of offset from desc, where desc itself was calculated
from offset.

There is no benefit from the desc -> hwgpio conversion in this context.
The only implicit benefit of the offset -> desc -> hwgpio is
the range check in the offset -> desc, but where desc is required you
still get that, and where desc isn't required it is simpler to perform
the range check directly.
