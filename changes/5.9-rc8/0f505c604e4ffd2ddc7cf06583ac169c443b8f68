net: ena: add support for traffic mirroring

Add support for traffic mirroring, where the hardware reads the
buffer from the instance memory directly.

Traffic Mirroring needs access to the rx buffers in the instance.
To have this access, this patch:
1. Changes the code to map and unmap the rx buffers bidirectionally.
2. Enables the relevant bit in driver_supported_features to indicate
   to the FW that this driver supports traffic mirroring.

Rx completion is not generated until mirroring is done to avoid
the situation where the driver changes the buffer before it is
mirrored.
