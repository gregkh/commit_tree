mm/debug: print head flags in dump_page

Tail page flags contain very little useful information.  Print the head
page's flags instead.  While the flags will contain "head" for tail pages,
this should not be too confusing as the previous line starts with the word
"head:" and so the flags should be interpreted as belonging to the head
page.
