lib/test_bitops: do the full test during module init

Currently, the bitops test consists of two parts: one part is executed
during module load, the second part during module unload.  This is
cumbersome for the user, as he has to perform two steps to execute all
tests, and is different from most (all?) other tests.

Merge the two parts, so both are executed during module load.
