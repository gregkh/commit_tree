PCI: hv: Make some functions static

sparse report build warning as follows:

drivers/pci/controller/pci-hyperv.c:941:5: warning:
 symbol 'hv_read_config_block' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/pci/controller/pci-hyperv.c:1021:5: warning:
 symbol 'hv_write_config_block' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/pci/controller/pci-hyperv.c:1090:5: warning:
 symbol 'hv_register_block_invalidate' was not declared. Should it be static?

Those functions are not used outside of this file, so mark them static.
