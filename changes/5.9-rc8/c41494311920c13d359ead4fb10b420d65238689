crypto: cpt - Fix sparse warnings

This patch fixes all the sparse warnings in the octeontx driver.
Some of these are just trivial type changes.

However, some of the changes are non-trivial on little-endian hosts.
Obviously the driver appears to be broken on either LE or BE as it
was doing different things.  I've taken the BE behaviour as the
correct one.
