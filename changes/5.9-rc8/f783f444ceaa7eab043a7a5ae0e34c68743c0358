nvme: introduce nvme_ctrl_get_by_path()

nvme_ctrl_get_by_path() is analogous to blkdev_get_by_path() except it
gets a struct nvme_ctrl from the path to its char dev (/dev/nvme0).
It makes use of filp_open() to open the file and uses the private
data to obtain a pointer to the struct nvme_ctrl. If the fops of the
file do not match, -EINVAL is returned.

The purpose of this function is to support NVMe-OF target passthru
and is exported under the NVME_TARGET_PASSTHRU namespace.
