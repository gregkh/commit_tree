ASoC: fsl_sai: Refine regcache usage with pm runtime

When there is dedicated power domain bound with device, after probing
the power will be disabled, then registers are not accessible in
fsl_sai_dai_probe(), so regcache only need to be enabled in end of
probe() and regcache_mark_dirty should be moved to pm runtime resume
callback function.
