blk-mq: add a new blk_mq_complete_request_remote API

This is a variant of blk_mq_complete_request_remote that only completes
the request if it needs to be bounced to another CPU or a softirq.  If
the request can be completed locally the function returns false and lets
the driver complete it without requring and indirect function call.
