mm/vmalloc: simplify merge_or_add_vmap_area()

Currently when a VA is deallocated and is about to be placed back to the
tree, it can be either: merged with next/prev neighbors or inserted if not
coalesced.

On those steps the tree can be populated several times.  For example when
both neighbors are merged.  It can be avoided and simplified in fact.

Therefore do it only once when VA points to final merged area, after all
manipulations: merging/removing/inserting.
