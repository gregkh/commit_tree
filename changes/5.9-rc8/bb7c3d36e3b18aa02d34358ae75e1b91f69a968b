powerpc/pseries: remove prrn special case from DT update path

pseries_devicetree_update() is no longer called with PRRN_SCOPE. The
purpose of prrn_update_node() was to remove and then add back a LMB
whose NUMA assignment had changed. This has never been reliable, and
this codepath has been default-disabled for several releases. Remove
prrn_update_node().
