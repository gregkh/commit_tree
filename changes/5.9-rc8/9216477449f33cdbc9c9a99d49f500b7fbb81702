bpf: cpumap: Add the possibility to attach an eBPF program to cpumap

Introduce the capability to attach an eBPF program to cpumap entries.
The idea behind this feature is to add the possibility to define on
which CPU run the eBPF program if the underlying hw does not support
RSS. Current supported verdicts are XDP_DROP and XDP_PASS.

This patch has been tested on Marvell ESPRESSObin using xdp_redirect_cpu
sample available in the kernel tree to identify possible performance
regressions. Results show there are no observable differences in
packet-per-second:

$./xdp_redirect_cpu --progname xdp_cpu_map0 --dev eth0 --cpu 1
