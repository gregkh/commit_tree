bpf/local_storage: Fix build without CONFIG_CGROUP

local_storage.o has its compile guard as CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL, which
does not imply that CONFIG_CGROUP is on. Including cgroup-internal.h
when CONFIG_CGROUP is off cause a compilation failure.

Fixes: f67cfc233706 ("bpf: Make cgroup storages shared between programs on the same cgroup")
