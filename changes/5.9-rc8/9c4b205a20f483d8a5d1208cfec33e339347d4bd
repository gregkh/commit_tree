ASoC: meson: axg-toddr: fix channel order on g12 platforms

On g12 and following platforms, The first channel of record with more than
2 channels ends being placed randomly on an even channel of the output.

On these SoCs, a bit was added to force the first channel to be placed at
the beginning of the output. Apparently the behavior if the bit is not set
is not easily predictable. According to the documentation, this bit is not
present on the axg series.

Set the bit on g12 and fix the problem.
