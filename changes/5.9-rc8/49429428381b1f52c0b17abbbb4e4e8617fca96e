HID: lenovo: Fix spurious F23 key press report during resume from suspend

The Ultrabook Keyboard sends a spurious F23 key-press when resuming
from suspend. GNOME uses F23 to toggle the touchpad on/off so this causes
the OSD graphics for the touchpad toggle to show on resume.

The keyboard does not actually have a F23 key, se we can simple fix it
by marking the 0x00070072 HID usage, which normally is F23, to be ignored.
