powerpc/pseries/hotplug-cpu: Remove double free in error path

In the unlikely event that the device tree lacks a /cpus node,
find_dlpar_cpus_to_add() oddly frees the cpu_drcs buffer it has been
passed before returning an error. Its only caller also frees the
buffer on error.

Remove the less conventional kfree() of a caller-supplied buffer from
find_dlpar_cpus_to_add().
