ARM: dts: meson8m2: add resets for the power domain controller

The Meson8m2 SoCs has introduced additional reset lines for the VPU
compared to Meson8. Also it uses a slightly different VPU clock
frequency compared to Meson8 since it can now achieve 364MHz thanks to
the addition of the GP_PLL.
Add the reset lines, VPU clock configuration and update the compatible
string so the implementation differences can be managed.
