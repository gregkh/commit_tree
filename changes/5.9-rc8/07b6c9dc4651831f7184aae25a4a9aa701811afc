iio: stm32-dfsdm-adc: remove usage of iio_priv_to_dev() helper

We may want to get rid of the iio_priv_to_dev() helper. The reason is that
we will hide some of the members of the iio_dev structure (to prevent
drivers from accessing them directly), and that will also mean hiding the
implementation of the iio_priv_to_dev() helper inside the IIO core.

Hiding the implementation of iio_priv_to_dev() implies that some fast-paths
may not be fast anymore, so a general idea is to try to get rid of the
iio_priv_to_dev() altogether.
The iio_priv() helper won't be affected by the rework, as the iio_dev
struct will keep a reference to the private information.

For this driver, not using iio_priv_to_dev(), means reworking some paths to
pass the iio device and using iio_priv() to access the private information.
