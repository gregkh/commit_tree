io_uring: change the poll type to be 32-bits

poll events should be 32-bits to cover EPOLLEXCLUSIVE.

Explicit word-swap the poll32_events for big endian to make sure the ABI
is not changed.  We call this feature IORING_FEAT_POLL_32BITS,
applications who want to use EPOLLEXCLUSIVE should check the feature bit
first.
