s390/idle: fix suspicious RCU usage

After commit eb1f00237aca ("lockdep,trace: Expose tracepoints") the
lock tracepoints are visible to lockdep and RCU-lockdep is finding a
bunch more RCU violations that were previously hidden.

Switch the idle->seqcount over to using raw_write_*() to avoid the
lockdep annotation and thus the lock tracepoints.
