x86/ioapic: Unbreak check_timer()

Several people reported in the kernel bugzilla that between v4.12 and v4.13
the magic which works around broken hardware and BIOSes to find the proper
timer interrupt delivery mode stopped working for some older affected
platforms which need to fall back to ExtINT delivery mode.

The reason is that the core code changed to keep track of the masked and
disabled state of an interrupt line more accurately to avoid the expensive
hardware operations.

That broke an assumption in i8259_make_irq() which invokes

     disable_irq_nosync();
     irq_set_chip_and_handler();
     enable_irq();

Up to v4.12 this worked because enable_irq() unconditionally unmasked the
interrupt line, but after the state tracking improvements this is not
longer the case because the IO/APIC uses lazy disabling. So the line state
is unmasked which means that enable_irq() does not call into the new irq
chip to unmask it.

In principle this is a shortcoming of the core code, but it's more than
unclear whether the core code should try to reset state. At least this
cannot be done unconditionally as that would break other existing use cases
where the chip type is changed, e.g. when changing the trigger type, but
the callers expect the state to be preserved.

As the way how check_timer() is switching the delivery modes is truly
unique, the obvious fix is to simply unmask the i8259 manually after
changing the mode to ExtINT delivery and switching the irq chip to the
legacy PIC.

Note, that the fixes tag is not really precise, but identifies the commit
which broke the assumptions in the IO/APIC and i8259 code and that's the
kernel version to which this needs to be backported.
