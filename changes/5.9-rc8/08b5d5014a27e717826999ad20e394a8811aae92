xattr: break delegations in {set,remove}xattr

set/removexattr on an exported filesystem should break NFS delegations.
This is true in general, but also for the upcoming support for
RFC 8726 (NFSv4 extended attribute support). Make sure that they do.

Additionally, they need to grow a _locked variant, since callers might
call this with i_rwsem held (like the NFS server code).
