futex: Consistently use fshared as boolean

Since fshared is only conveying true/false values, declare it as bool.

In get_futex_key() the usage of fshared can be restricted to the first part
of the function. If fshared is false the function is terminated early and
the subsequent code can use a constant 'true' instead of the variable.
