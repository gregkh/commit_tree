KVM: VMX: update PFEC_MASK/PFEC_MATCH together with PF intercept

The PFEC_MASK and PFEC_MATCH fields in the VMCS reverse the meaning of
the #PF intercept bit in the exception bitmap when they do not match.
This means that, if PFEC_MASK and/or PFEC_MATCH are set, the
hypervisor can get a vmexit for #PF exceptions even when the
corresponding bit is clear in the exception bitmap.

This is unexpected and is promptly detected by a WARN_ON_ONCE.
To fix it, reset PFEC_MASK and PFEC_MATCH when the #PF intercept
is disabled (as is common with enable_ept && !allow_smaller_maxphyaddr).
