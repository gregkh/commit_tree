thermal: Add current mode to thermal zone device

Prepare for changing the place where the mode is stored: now it is in
drivers, which might or might not implement get_mode()/set_mode() methods.
A lot of cleanup can be done thanks to storing it in struct tzd. The
get_mode() methods will become redundant.
