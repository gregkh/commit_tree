regulator: qcom-rpmh-regulator: Repair dodgy kerneldoc header formatting

W=1 kernel builds report a lack of descriptions for various
enum properties and function arguments.  In reality they are
documented, but the formatting was not as expected '@.*:'.
Instead, some weird arg identifiers were used or none at all.

This change fixes the following warnings:

 drivers/regulator/qcom-rpmh-regulator.c:33: warning: Enum value 'VRM' not described in enum 'rpmh_regulator_type'
 drivers/regulator/qcom-rpmh-regulator.c:33: warning: Enum value 'XOB' not described in enum 'rpmh_regulator_type'

 drivers/regulator/qcom-rpmh-regulator.c:416: warning: Function parameter or member 'pmic_rpmh_data' not described in 'rpmh_regulator_init_vreg'
