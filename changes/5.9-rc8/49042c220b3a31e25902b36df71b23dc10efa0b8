l3mdev: add infrastructure for table to VRF mapping

Add infrastructure to l3mdev (the core code for Layer 3 master devices) in
order to find out the corresponding VRF device for a given table id.
Therefore, the l3mdev implementations:
 - can register a callback that returns the device index of the l3mdev
   associated with a given table id;
 - can offer the lookup function (table to VRF device).
