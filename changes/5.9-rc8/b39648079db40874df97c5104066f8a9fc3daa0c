net: mscc: ocelot: disable flow control on NPI interface

The Ocelot switches do not support flow control on Ethernet interfaces
where a DSA tag must be added. If pause frames are enabled, they will be
encapsulated in the DSA tag just like regular frames, and the DSA master
will not recognize them.
