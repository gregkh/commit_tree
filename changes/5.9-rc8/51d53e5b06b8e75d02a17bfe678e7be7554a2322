backlight: Use backlight_get_brightness() throughout

Introduce the backlight_get_brightness() helper in all
video/backlight/* drivers. This simplifies the code and align the
implementation of the update_status() operation across the different
backlight drivers.

Some of the drivers gains a little extra functionality by the change
as they now respect the fb_blank() ioctl.
