/proc/PID/smaps: consistent whitespace output format

The keys in smaps output are padded to fixed width with spaces.  All
except for THPeligible that uses tabs (only since commit c06306696f83
("mm: thp: fix false negative of shmem vma's THP eligibility")).

Unify the output formatting to save time debugging some naïve parsers.
(Part of the unification is also aligning FilePmdMapped with others.)
