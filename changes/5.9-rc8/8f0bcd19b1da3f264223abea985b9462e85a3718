net/mlx5e: TLS, Do not expose FPGA TLS counter if not supported

The set of TLS TX global SW counters in mlx5e_tls_sw_stats_desc
is updated from all rings by using atomic ops.
This set of stats is used only in the FPGA TLS use case, not in
the Connect-X TLS one, where regular per-ring counters are used.

Do not expose them in the Connect-X use case, as this would cause
counter duplication. For example, tx_tls_drop_no_sync_data would
appear twice in the ethtool stats.
