ixgbe: use generic power management

With legacy PM hooks, it was the responsibility of a driver to manage PCI
states and also the device's power state. The generic approach is to let
PCI core handle the work.

ixgbe_suspend() calls __ixgbe_shutdown() to perform intermediate tasks.
__ixgbe_shutdown() modifies the value of "wake" (device should be wakeup
enabled or not), responsible for controlling the flow of legacy PM.

Since, PCI core has no idea about the value of "wake", new code for generic
PM may produce unexpected results. Thus, use "device_set_wakeup_enable()"
to wakeup-enable the device accordingly.

Compile-tested only.
