dt-bindings: display: vc4: dpi: Fix panel warning

The example used in the DPI binding before the conversion to YAML had a
simple-panel example that got carried over to the YAML binding.

However, that example doesn't match the simple-panel binding and results in
validation errors. Since it's only marginally helpful, let's remove that
part of the example entirely.
