mailbox: pcc: Put the PCCT table for error path

The acpi_get_table() should be coupled with acpi_put_table() if
the mapped table is not used at runtime to release the table
mapping.

In acpi_pcc_probe(), the PCCT table entries will be used as private
data for communication chan at runtime, but the table should be put
for error path.
