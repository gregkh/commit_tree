af_packet: TPACKET_V3: replace busy-wait loop

A busy-wait loop is used to implement waiting for bits to be copied
from the skb to the kernel buffer before retiring a block. This is
a problem on PREEMPT_RT because the copying task could be preempted
by the busy-waiting task and thus live lock in the busy-wait loop.

Replace the busy-wait logic with an rwlock_t. This provides lockdep
coverage and makes the code RT ready.
