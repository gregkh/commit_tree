drivers/dax: Expand lock scope to cover the use of addresses

The addition of PKS protection to dax read lock/unlock will require that
the address returned by dax_direct_access() be protected by this lock.

Correct the locking by ensuring that the use of kaddr and end_kaddr
are covered by the dax read lock/unlock.
