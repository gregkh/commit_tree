mtd: rawnand: Reorganize the nand_chip structure

Reorder fields in this structure and pack entries by theme:
* The main descriptive structures
* The data interface details
* Bad block information
* The device layout
* Extra buffers matching the device layout
* Internal values
* External objects like the ECC controller, the ECC engine and a
  private data pointer.

While at it, adapt the documentation style.

I changed on purpose the description of @oob_poi which was weird.
