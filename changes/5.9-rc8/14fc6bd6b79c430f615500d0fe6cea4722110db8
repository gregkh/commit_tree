bpf: Refactor bpf_iter_reg to have separate seq_info member

There is no functionality change for this patch.
Struct bpf_iter_reg is used to register a bpf_iter target,
which includes information for both prog_load, link_create
and seq_file creation.

This patch puts fields related seq_file creation into
a different structure. This will be useful for map
elements iterator where one iterator covers different
map types and different map types may have different
seq_ops, init/fini private_data function and
private_data size.
