regmap: fix page selection for noinc reads

Non-incrementing reads can fail if register + length crosses page
border. However for non-incrementing reads we should not check for page
border crossing. Fix this by passing additional flag to _regmap_raw_read
and passing length to _regmap_select_page basing on the flag.
