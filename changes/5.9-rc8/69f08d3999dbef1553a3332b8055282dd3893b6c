rcu/tree: Use static initializer for krc.lock

The per-CPU variable is initialized at runtime in
kfree_rcu_batch_init(). This function is invoked before
'rcu_scheduler_active' is set to 'RCU_SCHEDULER_RUNNING'.
After the initialisation, '->initialized' is to true.

The raw_spin_lock is only acquired if '->initialized' is
set to true. The worqueue item is only used if 'rcu_scheduler_active'
set to RCU_SCHEDULER_RUNNING which happens after initialisation.

Use a static initializer for krc.lock and remove the runtime
initialisation of the lock. Since the lock can now be always
acquired, remove the '->initialized' check.
