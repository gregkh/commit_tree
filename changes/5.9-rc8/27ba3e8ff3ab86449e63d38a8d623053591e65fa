scsi: sd: sd_zbc: Fix handling of host-aware ZBC disks

When CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED is disabled, allow using host-aware ZBC disks as
regular disks. In this case, ensure that command completion is correctly
executed by changing sd_zbc_complete() to return good_bytes instead of 0
and causing a hang during device probe (endless retries).

When CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED is enabled and a host-aware disk is detected to
have partitions, it will be used as a regular disk. In this case, make sure
to not do anything in sd_zbc_revalidate_zones() as that triggers warnings.

Since all these different cases result in subtle settings of the disk queue
zoned model, introduce the block layer helper function
blk_queue_set_zoned() to generically implement setting up the effective
zoned model according to the disk type, the presence of partitions on the
disk and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED configuration.
