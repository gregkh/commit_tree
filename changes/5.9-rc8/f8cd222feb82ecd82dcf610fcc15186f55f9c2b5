iio:adc:ina2xx Fix timestamp alignment issue.

One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
this driver which uses a 32 byte array of smaller elements on the stack.
As Lars also noted this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to
userspace and that indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by
moving to a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data with alignment
explicitly requested.  This data is allocated with kzalloc so no
data can leak apart from previous readings. The explicit alignment
isn't technically needed here, but it reduced fragility and avoids
cut and paste into drivers where it will be needed.

If we want this in older stables will need manual backport due to
driver reworks.
