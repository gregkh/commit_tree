vt: convert vc_tab_stop to bitmap

vc_tab_stop is used as a bitmap, but defined as an unsigned int array.
Switch it to bitmap and convert all users to the bitmap interface.

Note the difference in behavior! We no longer mask the top 24 bits away
from x, hence we do not wrap tabs at 256th column. Instead, we silently
drop attempts to set a tab behind 256 columns. And we will also seek by
'\t' to the rightmost column, when behind that boundary. I do not think
the original behavior was desired and that someone relies on that. If
this turns out to be the case, we can change the added 'if's back to
masks here and there instead...

(Or we can increase the limit as fb consoles now have 240 chars here.
And they could have more with higher than my resolution, of course.)
