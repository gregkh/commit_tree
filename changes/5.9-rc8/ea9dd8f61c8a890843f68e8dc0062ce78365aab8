ARM: exynos: MCPM: Restore big.LITTLE cpuidle support

Call exynos_cpu_power_up(cpunr) unconditionally. This is needed by the
big.LITTLE cpuidle driver and has no side-effects on other code paths.

The additional soft-reset call during little core power up has been added
to properly boot all cores on the Exynos5422-based boards with secure
firmware (like Odroid XU3/XU4 family). This however broke big.LITTLE
CPUidle driver, which worked only on boards without secure firmware (like
Peach-Pit/Pi Chromebooks). Apply the workaround only when board is
running under secure firmware.
