net: usb: Fix uninit-was-stored issue in asix_read_phy_addr()

The buffer size is 2 Bytes and we expect to receive the same amount of
data. But sometimes we receive less data and run into uninit-was-stored
issue upon read. Hence modify the error check on the return value to match
with the buffer size as a prevention.
