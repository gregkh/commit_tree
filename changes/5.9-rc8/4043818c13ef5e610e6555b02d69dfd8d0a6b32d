ice: distribute Tx queues evenly

Distribute the Tx queues evenly across all queue groups. This will
help the queues to get more equal sharing among the queues when all
are in use.

In the previous algorithm, the next queue group node will be picked up
only after the previous one filled with max children.
For example: if VSI is configured with 9 queues, the first 8 queues
will be assigned to queue group 1 and the 9th queue will be assigned to
queue group 2.

The 2 queue groups split the bandwidth between them equally (50:50).
The first queue group node will share the 50% bandwidth with all of
its children (8 queues). And the second queue group node will share
the entire 50% bandwidth with its only children.

The new algorithm will fix this issue.
