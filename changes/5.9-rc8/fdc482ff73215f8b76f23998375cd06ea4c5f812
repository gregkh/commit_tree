memory: ti-aemif: Rename SS to SSTROBE to avoid name conflicts

SS conflicts with compile test build on i386:

    drivers/memory/ti-aemif.c:40:0: warning: "SS" redefined

    arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/ptrace-abi.h:23:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
     #define SS   16

Use more descriptive name (SSTROBE) to avoid the conflict.
