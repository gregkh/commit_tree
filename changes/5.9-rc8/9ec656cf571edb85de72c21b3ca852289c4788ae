media: docs-rst: Document memory-to-memory video encoder interface

Due to complexity of the video encoding process, the V4L2 drivers of
stateful encoder hardware require specific sequences of V4L2 API calls
to be followed. These include capability enumeration, initialization,
encoding, encode parameters change, drain and reset.

Specifics of the above have been discussed during Media Workshops at
LinuxCon Europe 2012 in Barcelona and then later Embedded Linux
Conference Europe 2014 in DÃ¼sseldorf. The de facto Codec API that
originated at those events was later implemented by the drivers we already
have merged in mainline, such as s5p-mfc or coda.

The only thing missing was the real specification included as a part of
Linux Media documentation. Fix it now and document the encoder part of
the Codec API.
