HID: quirks: Set INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE for all Saitek X52 devices

The Saitek X52 family of joysticks has a pair of axes that were
originally (by the Windows driver) used as mouse pointer controls. The
corresponding usage page is the Game Controls page, which is not
recognized by the generic HID driver, and therefore, both axes get
mapped to ABS_MISC. The quirk makes the second axis get mapped to
ABS_MISC+1, and therefore made available separately.

One Saitek X52 device is already fixed. This patch fixes the other two
known devices with VID/PID 06a3:0255 and 06a3:0762.
