arm64: dts: mt8183: Fix unit name warnings

Remove the unit address from the DT nodes that doesn't have a reg
property. This fixes the following unit name warnings:

  Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /cpus/idle-states/cluster-sleep@0: node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property
  Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /cpus/idle-states/cluster-sleep@1: node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property
