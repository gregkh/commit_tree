powerpc/32s: Use dedicated segment for modules with STRICT_KERNEL_RWX

When STRICT_KERNEL_RWX is set, we want to set NX bit on vmalloc
segments. But modules require exec.

Use a dedicated segment for modules. There is not much space
above kernel, and we don't waste vmalloc space to do alignment.
Therefore, we take the segment before PAGE_OFFSET for modules.
