scsi: sd: sd_zbc: Fix ZBC disk initialization

Make sure to call sd_zbc_init_disk() when the sdkp->zoned field is known,
that is, once sd_read_block_characteristics() is executed in
sd_revalidate_disk(), so that host-aware disks also get initialized.  To do
so, move sd_zbc_init_disk() call in sd_zbc_revalidate_zones() and make sure
to execute it for all zoned disks, including for host-aware disks used as
regular disks as these disk zoned model may be changed back to BLK_ZONED_HA
when partitions are deleted.
