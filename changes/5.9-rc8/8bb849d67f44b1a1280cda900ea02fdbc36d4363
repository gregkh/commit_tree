net: mscc: ocelot: fix non-initialized CPU port on VSC7514

The VSC7514 is marketed as a 10-port switch, however it has 11 physical
ports (0->10) in the block diagram:
https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/ethernet-switches/3992-vsc7514
(also in the device tree at arch/mips/boot/dts/mscc/ocelot.dtsi)

Additionally, by architecture it has one more entry in the analyzer
block, situated right after the physical ports, for the CPU port module.
This is not a physical port, it only represents a channel for frame
injection and extraction. That entry for the CPU port is at index 11 in
the analyzer.

When the register groups for QSYS_SWITCH_PORT_MODE, SYS_PORT_MODE and
SYS_PAUSE_CFG are declared to be replicated 11 times, the 11th entry in
the array of regfields is not initialized, so the CPU port module is not
initialized either.

The documentation of QSYS_SWITCH_PORT_MODE for VSC7514 also says that
this register group is replicated 12 times, so this patch is simply
reflecting that and not introducing any further inconsistency.
