nilfs2: only call unlock_new_inode() if I_NEW

Patch series "nilfs2 updates".

This patch (of 3):

unlock_new_inode() is only meant to be called after a new inode has
already been inserted into the hash table.  But nilfs_new_inode() can call
it even before it has inserted the inode, triggering the WARNING in
unlock_new_inode().  Fix this by only calling unlock_new_inode() if the
inode has the I_NEW flag set, indicating that it's in the table.
