KVM: selftests: Add event channel upcall support to xen_shinfo_test

When I first looked at this, there was no support for guest exception
handling in the KVM selftests. In fact it was merged into 5.10 before
the Xen support got merged in 5.11, and I could have used it from the
start.

Hook it up now, to exercise the Xen upcall delivery. I'm about to make
things a bit more interesting by handling the full 2level event channel
stuff in-kernel on top of the basic vector injection that we already
have, and I'll want to build more tests on top.
