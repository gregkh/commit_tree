mac80211: drop check for DONT_REORDER in __ieee80211_select_queue

When __ieee80211_select_queue is called, skb->cb has not been cleared yet,
which means that info->control.flags can contain garbage.
In some cases this leads to IEEE80211_TX_CTRL_DONT_REORDER being set, causing
packets marked for other queues to randomly end up in BE instead.

This flag only needs to be checked in ieee80211_select_queue_80211, since
the radiotap parser is the only piece of code that sets it
