Documentation/process: fix a cross reference

The cross-reference for the handbooks section works. However, it is
meant to describe the path inside the Kernel's doc where the section
is, but there's an space instead of a dash, plus it lacks the .rst at
the end, which makes:

	./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check

to complain.
