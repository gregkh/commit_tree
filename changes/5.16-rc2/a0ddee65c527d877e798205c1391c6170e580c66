printk: Remove printk.h inclusion in percpu.h

After the commit 42a0bb3f7138 ("printk/nmi: generic solution for safe
printk in NMI") the printk.h is not needed anymore in percpu.h.

Moreover `make headerdep` complains (an excerpt)

In file included from linux/printk.h,
                 from linux/dynamic_debug.h:188
                 from linux/printk.h:559 <-- here
                 from linux/percpu.h:9
                 from linux/idr.h:17
include/net/9p/client.h:13: warning: recursive header inclusion

Yeah, it's not a root cause of this, but removing will help to reduce
the noise.
