pinctrl: qcom: sm8350: Correct UFS and SDC offsets

The downstream TLMM binding covers a group of TLMM-related hardware
blocks, but the upstream binding only captures the particular block
related to controlling the TLMM pins from an OS. In the translation of
the driver from downstream, the offset of 0x100000 was lost for the UFS
and SDC pingroups.
