hugetlb: fix hugetlb cgroup refcounting during mremap

When hugetlb_vm_op_open() is called during copy_vma(), we may take the
reference to resv_map->css.  Later, when clearing the reservation
pointer of old_vma after transferring it to new_vma, we forget to drop
the reference to resv_map->css.  This leads to a reference leak of css.

Fixes this by adding a check to drop reservation css reference in
clear_vma_resv_huge_pages()
