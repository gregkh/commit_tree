lib: zstd: Fix unused variable warning

The variable `litLengthSum` is only used by an `assert()`, so when
asserts are disabled the compiler doesn't see any usage and warns.

This issue is already fixed upstream by PR #2838 [0]. It was reported
by the Kernel test robot in [1].

Another approach would be to change zstd's disabled `assert()`
definition to use the argument in a disabled branch, instead of
ignoring the argument. I've avoided this approach because there are
some small changes necessary to get zstd to build, and I would
want to thoroughly re-test for performance, since that is slightly
changing the code in every function in zstd. It seems like a
trivial change, but some functions are pretty sensitive to small
changes. However, I think it is a valid approach that I would
like to see upstream take, so I've opened Issue #2868 to attempt
this upstream.

Lastly, I've chosen not to use __maybe_unused because all code
in lib/zstd/ must eventually be upstreamed. Upstream zstd can't
use __maybe_unused because it isn't portable across all compilers.
