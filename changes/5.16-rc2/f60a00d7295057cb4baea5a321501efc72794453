KVM: arm64: Cap KVM_CAP_NR_VCPUS by kvm_arm_default_max_vcpus()

Generally, it doesn't make sense to return the recommended maximum number
of vCPUs which exceeds the maximum possible number of vCPUs.

Note: ARM64 is special as the value returned by KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS differs
depending on whether it is a system-wide ioctl or a per-VM one. Previously,
KVM_CAP_NR_VCPUS didn't have this difference and it seems preferable to
keep the status quo. Cap KVM_CAP_NR_VCPUS by kvm_arm_default_max_vcpus()
which is what gets returned by system-wide KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS.
