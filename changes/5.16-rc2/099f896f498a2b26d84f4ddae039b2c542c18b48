udp: Validate checksum in udp_read_sock()

It turns out the skb's in sock receive queue could have bad checksums, as
both ->poll() and ->recvmsg() validate checksums. We have to do the same
for ->read_sock() path too before they are redirected in sockmap.

Fixes: d7f571188ecf ("udp: Implement ->read_sock() for sockmap")
