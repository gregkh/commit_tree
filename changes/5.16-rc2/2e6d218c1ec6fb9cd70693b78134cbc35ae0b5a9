i40e: Fix creation of first queue by omitting it if is not power of two

Reject TCs creation with proper message if the first queue
assignment is not equal to the power of two.
The first queue number was checked too late in the second queue
iteration, if second queue was configured at all. Now if first queue value
is not a power of two, then trying to create qdisc will be rejected.
