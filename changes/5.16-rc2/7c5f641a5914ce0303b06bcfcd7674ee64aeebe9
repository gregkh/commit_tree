ata: libahci: Adjust behavior when StorageD3Enable _DSD is set

The StorageD3Enable _DSD is used for the vendor to indicate that the disk
should be opted into or out of a different behavior based upon the platform
design.

For AMD's Renoir and Green Sardine platforms it's important that any
attached SATA storage has transitioned into DevSlp when s2idle is used.

If the disk is left in active/partial/slumber, then the system is not able
to resume properly.

When the StorageD3Enable _DSD is detected, check the system is using s2idle
and DevSlp is enabled and if so explicitly wait long enough for the disk to
enter DevSlp.
