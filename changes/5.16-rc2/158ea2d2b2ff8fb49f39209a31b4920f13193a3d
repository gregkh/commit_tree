kbuild: Fix -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 error for GCC 5.x and 6.x

-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 was under cc-option because it was only
available in GCC 7.x and newer so the build is now broken for GCC 5.x
and 6.x:

gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5';
did you mean '-Wno-fallthrough'?

Fix this by moving -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 under cc-option.
