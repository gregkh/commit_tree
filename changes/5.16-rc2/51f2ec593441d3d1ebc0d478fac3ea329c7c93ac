hexagon: clean up timer-regs.h

When building allmodconfig, there is a warning about TIMER_ENABLE being
redefined:

  drivers/clocksource/timer-oxnas-rps.c:39:9: error: 'TIMER_ENABLE' macro redefined [-Werror,-Wmacro-redefined]
  #define TIMER_ENABLE            BIT(7)
          ^
  arch/hexagon/include/asm/timer-regs.h:13:9: note: previous definition is here
  #define TIMER_ENABLE            0
           ^
  1 error generated.

The values in this header are only used in one file each, if they are
used at all.  Remove the header and sink all of the constants into their
respective files.

TCX0_CLK_RATE is only used in arch/hexagon/include/asm/timex.h

TIMER_ENABLE, RTOS_TIMER_INT, RTOS_TIMER_REGS_ADDR are only used in
arch/hexagon/kernel/time.c.

SLEEP_CLK_RATE and TIMER_CLR_ON_MATCH have both been unused since the
file's introduction in commit 71e4a47f32f4 ("Hexagon: Add time and timer
functions").

TIMER_ENABLE is redefined as BIT(0) so the shift is moved into the
definition, rather than its use.
