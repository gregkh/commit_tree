net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix crash in RX resync flow

For the TLS RX resync flow, we maintain a list of TLS contexts
that require some attention, to communicate their resync information
to the HW.
Here we fix list corruptions, by protecting the entries against
movements coming from resync_handle_seq_match(), until their resync
handling in napi is fully completed.
