block: avoid to quiesce queue in elevator_init_mq

elevator_init_mq() is only called before adding disk, when there isn't
any FS I/O, only passthrough requests can be queued, so freezing queue
plus canceling dispatch work is enough to drain any dispatch activities,
then we can avoid synchronize_srcu() in blk_mq_quiesce_queue().

Long boot latency issue can be fixed in case of lots of disks added
during booting.
