tracing: Don't use out-of-sync va_list in event printing

If trace_seq becomes full, trace_seq_vprintf() no longer consumes
arguments from va_list, making va_list out of sync with format
processing by trace_check_vprintf().

This causes va_arg() in trace_check_vprintf() to return wrong
positional argument, which results into a WARN_ON_ONCE() hit.

ftrace_stress_test from LTP triggers this situation.

Fix it by explicitly avoiding further use if va_list at the point
when it's consistency can no longer be guaranteed.
