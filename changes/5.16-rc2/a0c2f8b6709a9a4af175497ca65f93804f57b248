scsi: iscsi: Unblock session then wake up error handler

We can race where iscsi_session_recovery_timedout() has woken up the error
handler thread and it's now setting the devices to offline, and
session_recovery_timedout()'s call to scsi_target_unblock() is also trying
to set the device's state to transport-offline. We can then get a mix of
states.

For the case where we can't relogin we want the devices to be in
transport-offline so when we have repaired the connection
__iscsi_unblock_session() can set the state back to running.

Set the device state then call into libiscsi to wake up the error handler.
