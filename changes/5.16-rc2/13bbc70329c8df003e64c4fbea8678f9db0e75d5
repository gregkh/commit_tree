KVM: selftests: Sync perf_test_args to guest during VM creation

Copy perf_test_args to the guest during VM creation instead of relying on
the caller to do so at their leisure.  Ideally, tests wouldn't even be
able to modify perf_test_args, i.e. they would have no motivation to do
the sync, but enforcing that is arguably a net negative for readability.

No functional change intended.

[Set wr_fract=1 by default and add helper to override it since the new
 access_tracking_perf_test needs to set it dynamically.]
