amt: cancel delayed_work synchronously in amt_fini()

When the amt module is being removed, it calls cancel_delayed_work()
to cancel pending delayed_work. But this function doesn't wait for
canceling delayed_work.
So, workers can be still doing after module delete.

In order to avoid this, cancel_delayed_work_sync() should be used instead.
