net/mlx5: DR, Handle eswitch manager and uplink vports separately

When querying eswitch manager vport capabilities as "other = 1",
we encounter a FW compatibility issue with older FW versions.
To maintain backward compatibility, eswitch manager vport should
be queried as "other = 0" vport both for ECPF and non-ECPF cases.

This patch fixes these queries and improves the code readability
by handling eswitch manager and uplink vports separately, avoiding
the excessive 'if' conditions. Also, uplink caps are stored similar
to esw manager and not as part of xarray.
