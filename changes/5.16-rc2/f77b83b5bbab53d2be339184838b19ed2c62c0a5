net: usb: r8152: Add MAC passthrough support for more Lenovo Docks

Like ThinkaPad Thunderbolt 4 Dock, more Lenovo docks start to use the original
Realtek USB ethernet chip ID 0bda:8153.

Lenovo Docks always use their own IDs for usb hub, even for older Docks.
If parent hub is from Lenovo, then r8152 should try MAC passthrough.
Verified on Lenovo TBT3 dock too.
