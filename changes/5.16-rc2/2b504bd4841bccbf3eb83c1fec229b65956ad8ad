blk-mq: don't insert FUA request with data into scheduler queue

We never insert flush request into scheduler queue before.

Recently commit d92ca9d8348f ("blk-mq: don't handle non-flush requests in
blk_insert_flush") tries to handle FUA data request as normal request.
This way has caused warning[1] in mq-deadline dd_exit_sched() or io hang in
case of kyber since RQF_ELVPRIV isn't set for flush request, then
->finish_request won't be called.

Fix the issue by inserting FUA data request with blk_mq_request_bypass_insert()
when the device supports FUA, just like what we did before.
