mac80211: fix monitor_sdata RCU/locking assertions

Since commit a05829a7222e ("cfg80211: avoid holding the RTNL when
calling the driver") we've not only been protecting the pointer
to monitor_sdata with the RTNL, but also with the wiphy->mtx. This
is relevant in a number of lockdep assertions, e.g. the one we hit
in ieee80211_set_monitor_channel(). However, we're now protecting
all the assignments/dereferences, even the one in interface iter,
with the wiphy->mtx, so switch over the lockdep assertions to that
lock.
