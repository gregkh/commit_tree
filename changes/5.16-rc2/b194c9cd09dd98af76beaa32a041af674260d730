perf evsel: Fix memory leaks relating to unit

unit may have a strdup pointer or be to a literal, consequently memory
assocciated with it isn't freed. Change it so the unit is always strdup
and so the memory can be safely freed.

Fix related issue in perf_event__process_event_update() for name and
own_cpus. Leaks were spotted by leak sanitizer.
