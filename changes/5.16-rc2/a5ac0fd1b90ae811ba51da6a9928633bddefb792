KVM: selftests: Remove perf_test_args.host_page_size

Remove perf_test_args.host_page_size and instead use getpagesize() so
that it's somewhat obvious that, for tests that care about the host page
size, they care about the system page size, not the hardware page size,
e.g. that the logic is unchanged if hugepages are in play.

No functional change intended.
