KVM: selftests: Use perf util's per-vCPU GPA/pages in demand paging test

Grab the per-vCPU GPA and number of pages from perf_util in the demand
paging test instead of duplicating perf_util's calculations.

Note, this may or may not result in a functional change.  It's not clear
that the test's calculations are guaranteed to yield the same value as
perf_util, e.g. if guest_percpu_mem_size != vcpu_args->pages.
