ACPI: Add stubs for wakeup handler functions

The commit ddfd9dcf270c ("ACPI: PM: Add acpi_[un]register_wakeup_handler()")
added new functions for drivers to use during the s2idle wakeup path, but
didn't add stubs for when CONFIG_ACPI wasn't set.

Add those stubs in for other drivers to be able to use.
