tools headers UAPI: Sync x86's asm/kvm.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  828ca89628bfcb1b ("KVM: x86: Expose TSC offset controls to userspace")

That just rebuilds kvm-stat.c on x86, no change in functionality.

This silences these perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
