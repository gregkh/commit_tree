ipv6: check return value of ipv6_skip_exthdr

The offset value is used in pointer math on skb->data.
Since ipv6_skip_exthdr may return -1 the pointer to uh and th
may not point to the actual udp and tcp headers and potentially
overwrite other stuff. This is why I think this should be checked.

EDIT:  added {}'s, thanks Kees
