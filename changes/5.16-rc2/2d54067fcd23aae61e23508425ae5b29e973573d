pinctrl: amd: Fix wakeups when IRQ is shared with SCI

On some Lenovo AMD Gen2 platforms the IRQ for the SCI and pinctrl drivers
are shared.  Due to how the s2idle loop handling works, this case needs
an extra explicit check whether the interrupt was caused by SCI or by
the GPIO controller.

To fix this rework the existing IRQ handler function to function as a
checker and an IRQ handler depending on the calling arguments.
