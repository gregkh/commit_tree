KVM: x86/xen: Fix get_attr of KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO

In commit 319afe68567b ("KVM: xen: do not use struct gfn_to_hva_cache") we
stopped storing this in-kernel as a GPA, and started storing it as a GFN.
Which means we probably should have stopped calling gpa_to_gfn() on it
when userspace asks for it back.
