KVM: Fix steal time asm constraints

In 64-bit mode, x86 instruction encoding allows us to use the low 8 bits
of any GPR as an 8-bit operand. In 32-bit mode, however, we can only use
the [abcd] registers. For which, GCC has the "q" constraint instead of
the less restrictive "r".

Also fix st->preempted, which is an input/output operand rather than an
input.
