net: sched: act_mirred: drop dst for the direction from egress to ingress

Without dropping dst, the packets sent from local mirred/redirected
to ingress will may still use the old dst. ip_rcv() will drop it as
the old dst is for output and its .input is dst_discard.

This patch is to fix by also dropping dst for those packets that are
mirred or redirected from egress to ingress in act_mirred.

Note that we don't drop it for the direction change from ingress to
egress, as on which there might be a user case attaching a metadata
dst by act_tunnel_key that would be used later.
