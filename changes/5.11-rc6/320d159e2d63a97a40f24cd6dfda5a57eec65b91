dt-bindings: rtc: add reset-source property

Some RTCs, e.g. the pcf2127, can be used as a hardware watchdog. But
if the reset pin is not actually wired up, the driver exposes a
watchdog device that doesn't actually work.

Provide a standard binding that can be used to indicate that a given
RTC can perform a reset of the machine, similar to wakeup-source.
