ARM: dts: rockchip: Remove 0 point from brightness-levels on rk3288-veyron

The extra 0 only adds one point in the userspace visible range,
so this change is almost a noop with the current driver behavior.

We don't need the 0% point, userspace seems to handle this just fine
because it uses the bl_power property to turn off the display.

Furthermore after adding "backlight: pwm_bl: Fix interpolation" patch,
the backlight interpolation will work a little differently. So we need
to preemptively remove the 0-3 segment since otherwise we would have a
252 long interpolation that would slowly go between 0 and 3, looking
really bad in userspace. So it's almost a noop/cleanup now, but it will
be required in the future.
