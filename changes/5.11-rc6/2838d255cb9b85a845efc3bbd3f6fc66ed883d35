btrfs: warn when remount will not change the free space tree

If the remount is ro->ro, rw->ro, or rw->rw, we will not create or
clear the free space tree. This can be surprising, so print a warning
to dmesg to make the failure more visible. It is also important to
ensure that the space cache options (SPACE_CACHE, FREE_SPACE_TREE) are
consistent, so ensure those are set to properly match the current on
disk state (which won't be changing).
