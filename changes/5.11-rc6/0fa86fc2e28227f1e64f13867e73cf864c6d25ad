pinctrl: merrifield: Set default bias in case no particular value given

When GPIO library asks pin control to set the bias, it doesn't pass
any value of it and argument is considered boolean (and this is true
for ACPI GpioIo() / GpioInt() resources, by the way). Thus, individual
drivers must behave well, when they got the resistance value of 1 Ohm,
i.e. transforming it to sane default.

In case of Intel Merrifield pin control hardware the 20 kOhm sounds plausible
because it gives a good trade off between weakness and minimization of leakage
current (will be only 50 uA with the above choice).
