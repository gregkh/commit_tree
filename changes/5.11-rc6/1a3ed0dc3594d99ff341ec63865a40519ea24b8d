mmc: sdhci-xenon: fix 1.8v regulator stabilization

Automatic Clock Gating is a feature used for the power consumption
optimisation. It turned out that during early init phase it may prevent the
stable voltage switch to 1.8V - due to that on some platforms an endless
printout in dmesg can be observed: "mmc1: 1.8V regulator output did not
became stable" Fix the problem by disabling the ACG at very beginning of
the sdhci_init and let that be enabled later.
