soundwire: bus: add comments to explain interrupt loop filter

The interrupt handling in SoundWire requires software to re-read the
interrupt status after clearing an interrupt. In case the interrupt is
still outstanding, the code in bus.c will loop a number of times,
however that loop is limited to the interrupts detected in the first
read. This strategy helps meet SoundWire requirements without
remaining forever in an interrupt handler.

Add a couple of comments to document this design.
