regulator: BD71847 support commonly used feedback connection

The BD71847 buck output voltages are in a few cases scaled using external
connection which adds a pull-up to regulator feedback pin. This connection
will adjust output voltage from regulator in a deterministic way.

Add support for describing this HW connection so that driver can adjust
voltage ranges accordingly.
