arm64: dts: rockchip: fix supplies on rk3399-rock-pi-4

Based on the board schematics at
https://dl.radxa.com/rockpi4/docs/hw/rockpi4/rockpi_4c_v12_sch_20200620.pdf
on page 18:
vcc_lan is not controllable by software, it is just an analog LC filter.
Because of this, it can not be turned off-in-suspend.

and on page 17:
vcc_cam and vcc_mipi are not voltage regulators, they are just switches.
So, the voltage range is not applicable.
This silences an error message about not being able to adjust the voltage.
