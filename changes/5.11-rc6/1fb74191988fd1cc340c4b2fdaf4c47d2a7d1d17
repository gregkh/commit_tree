net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix vlan setup

DSA assumes that a bridge which has vlan filtering disabled is not
vlan aware, and ignores all vlan configuration. However, the kernel
software bridge code allows configuration in this state.

This causes the kernel's idea of the bridge vlan state and the
hardware state to disagree, so "bridge vlan show" indicates a correct
configuration but the hardware lacks all configuration. Even worse,
enabling vlan filtering on a DSA bridge immediately blocks all traffic
which, given the output of "bridge vlan show", is very confusing.

Allow the VLAN configuration to be updated on Marvell DSA bridges,
otherwise we end up cutting all traffic when enabling vlan filtering.
