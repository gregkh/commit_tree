f2fs: add compress_mode mount option

We will add a new "compress_mode" mount option to control file
compression mode. This supports "fs" and "user". In "fs" mode (default),
f2fs does automatic compression on the compression enabled files.
In "user" mode, f2fs disables the automaic compression and gives the
user discretion of choosing the target file and the timing. It means
the user can do manual compression/decompression on the compression
enabled files using ioctls.
