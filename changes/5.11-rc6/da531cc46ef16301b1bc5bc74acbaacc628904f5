xfs: fix parent pointer scrubber bailing out on unallocated inodes

xfs_iget can return -ENOENT for a file that the inobt thinks is
allocated but has zeroed mode.  This currently causes scrub to exit
with an operational error instead of flagging this as a corruption.  The
end result is that scrub mistakenly reports the ENOENT to the user
instead of "directory parent pointer corrupt" like we do for EINVAL.
