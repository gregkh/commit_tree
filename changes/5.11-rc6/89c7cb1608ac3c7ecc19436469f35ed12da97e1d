of/device: Update dma_range_map only when dev has valid dma-ranges

The commit e0d072782c73 ("dma-mapping: introduce DMA range map,
supplanting dma_pfn_offset") always update dma_range_map even though it was
already set, like in the sunxi_mbus driver. the issue is reported at [1].
This patch avoid this(Updating it only when dev has valid dma-ranges).

Meanwhile, dma_range_map contains the devices' dma_ranges information,
This patch moves dma_range_map before of_iommu_configure. The iommu
driver may need to know the dma_address requirements of its iommu
consumer devices.
