scsi: lpfc: Fix NPIV Fabric Node reference counting

While testing initiator-side cable swaps with NPIV, oops occur.  The
reference counts for the Fabric nodes on the NPIV vports isn't balanced,
resulting in premature node removal.

The following fixes were made:

 - Removed the FC_LBIT check in lpfc_linkup_port. This removed the special
   case for vports that didn't have them clean up just like the physical
   port.

 - Removed the unreg_rpi call in lpfc_cleanup_node. In this section, the
   node is being removed in the context of a reference count release and a
   mailbox command can't be issued at this point.

 - Remove special case handling in the default mailbox completion handler
   that allowed the skipping of a node reference. Now, reference counting
   always requires the removal of the reference.

 - Move the location of the DEVICE_RM event is done during LOGO handling as
   the driver has additional work to do on the ndlp before puts/releases
   can be performed.
