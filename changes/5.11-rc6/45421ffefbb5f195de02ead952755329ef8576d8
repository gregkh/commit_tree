auxdisplay: Move clear_display to hd44780_common

This moves the clear_display function from charlcd to hd44780_common.
This is one more step to make charlcd independent from device specific
code. The two hd44780 drivers use the new function from hd44780_common
and charlcd calls this function through its function pointer in its ops
structure.
