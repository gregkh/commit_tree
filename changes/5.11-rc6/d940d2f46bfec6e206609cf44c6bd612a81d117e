media: mtk-vcodec: add missing put_device() call in mtk_vcodec_release_enc_pm()

mtk_vcodec_release_enc_pm() will be called in two places:

a. mtk_vcodec_init_enc_pm() succeed while mtk_vcodec_probe() return error.
b. mtk_vcodec_enc_remove().

In both cases put_device() call is needed, since of_find_device_by_node()
was called in mtk_vcodec_init_enc_pm() previously.

Thus add put_devices() call in mtk_vcodec_release_enc_pm()
