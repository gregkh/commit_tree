file: Merge __alloc_fd into alloc_fd

The function __alloc_fd was added to support binder[1].  With binder
fixed[2] there are no more users.

As alloc_fd just calls __alloc_fd with "files=current->files",
merge them together by transforming the files parameter into a
local variable initialized to current->files.
