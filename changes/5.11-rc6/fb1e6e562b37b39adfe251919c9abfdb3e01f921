bnxt_en: Fix AER recovery.

A recent change skips sending firmware messages to the firmware when
pci_channel_offline() is true during fatal AER error.  To make this
complete, we need to move the re-initialization sequence to
bnxt_io_resume(), otherwise the firmware messages to re-initialize
will all be skipped.  In any case, it is more correct to re-initialize
in bnxt_io_resume().

Also, fix the reverse x-mas tree format when defining variables
in bnxt_io_slot_reset().
