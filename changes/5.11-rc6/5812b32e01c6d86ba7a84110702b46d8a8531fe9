of: fix linker-section match-table corruption

Specify type alignment when declaring linker-section match-table entries
to prevent gcc from increasing alignment and corrupting the various
tables with padding (e.g. timers, irqchips, clocks, reserved memory).

This is specifically needed on x86 where gcc (typically) aligns larger
objects like struct of_device_id with static extent on 32-byte
boundaries which at best prevents matching on anything but the first
entry. Specifying alignment when declaring variables suppresses this
optimisation.

Here's a 64-bit example where all entries are corrupt as 16 bytes of
padding has been inserted before the first entry:

	ffffffff8266b4b0 D __clk_of_table
	ffffffff8266b4c0 d __of_table_fixed_factor_clk
	ffffffff8266b5a0 d __of_table_fixed_clk
	ffffffff8266b680 d __clk_of_table_sentinel

And here's a 32-bit example where the 8-byte-aligned table happens to be
placed on a 32-byte boundary so that all but the first entry are corrupt
due to the 28 bytes of padding inserted between entries:

	812b3ec0 D __irqchip_of_table
	812b3ec0 d __of_table_irqchip1
	812b3fa0 d __of_table_irqchip2
	812b4080 d __of_table_irqchip3
	812b4160 d irqchip_of_match_end

Verified on x86 using gcc-9.3 and gcc-4.9 (which uses 64-byte
alignment), and on arm using gcc-7.2.

Note that there are no in-tree users of these tables on x86 currently
(even if they are included in the image).
