selftests/bpf: Add an iterator selftest for bpf_sk_storage_get

The eBPF program iterates over all files and tasks. For all socket
files, it stores the tgid of the last task it encountered with a handle
to that socket. This is a heuristic for finding the "owner" of a socket
similar to what's done by lsof, ss, netstat or fuser. Potentially, this
information could be used from a cgroup_skb/*gress hook to try to
associate network traffic with processes.

The test makes sure that a socket it created is tagged with prog_tests's
pid.
