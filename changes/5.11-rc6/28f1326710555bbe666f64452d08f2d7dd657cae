eventfd: Export eventfd_ctx_do_read()

Where events are consumed in the kernel, for example by KVM's
irqfd_wakeup() and VFIO's virqfd_wakeup(), they currently lack a
mechanism to drain the eventfd's counter.

Since the wait queue is already locked while the wakeup functions are
invoked, all they really need to do is call eventfd_ctx_do_read().

Add a check for the lock, and export it for them.
