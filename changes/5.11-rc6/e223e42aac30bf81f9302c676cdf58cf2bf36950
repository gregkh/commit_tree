iwlwifi: mvm: invalidate IDs of internal stations at mvm start

Having sta_id not set for aux_sta and snif_sta can potentially lead to a
hard to debug issue in case remove station is called without an add. In
this case sta_id 0, an unrelated regular station, will be removed.

In fact, we do have a FW assert that occures rarely and from the debug
data analysis it looks like sta_id 0 is removed by mistake, though it's
hard to pinpoint the exact flow. The WARN_ON in this patch should help
to find it.
