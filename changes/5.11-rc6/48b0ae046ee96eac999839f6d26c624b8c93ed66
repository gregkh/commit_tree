netfilter: nftables: netlink support for several set element expressions

This patch adds three new netlink attributes to encapsulate a list of
expressions per set elements:

- NFTA_SET_EXPRESSIONS: this attribute provides the set definition in
  terms of expressions. New set elements get attached the list of
  expressions that is specified by this new netlink attribute.
- NFTA_SET_ELEM_EXPRESSIONS: this attribute allows users to restore (or
  initialize) the stateful information of set elements when adding an
  element to the set.
- NFTA_DYNSET_EXPRESSIONS: this attribute specifies the list of
  expressions that the set element gets when it is inserted from the
  packet path.
