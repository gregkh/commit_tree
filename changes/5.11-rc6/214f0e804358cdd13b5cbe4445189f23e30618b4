x86/compat: Simplify compat syscall userspace allocation

When allocating user memory space for a compat system call, don't consider
whether the originating code is IA32 or X32, just allocate from a safe
region for both, beyond the redzone.  This should be safe for IA32, and has
the benefit of avoiding TIF_IA32, which is about to be removed.
