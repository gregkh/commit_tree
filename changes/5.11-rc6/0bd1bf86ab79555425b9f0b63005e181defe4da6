dmaengine: qcom: fix gpi undefined behavior

gcc points out an incorrect error handling loop:

drivers/dma/qcom/gpi.c: In function 'gpi_ch_init':
drivers/dma/qcom/gpi.c:1254:15: error: iteration 2 invokes undefined behavior [-Werror=aggressive-loop-optimizations]
 1254 |  struct gpii *gpii = gchan->gpii;
      |               ^~~~
drivers/dma/qcom/gpi.c:1951:2: note: within this loop
 1951 |  for (i = i - 1; i >= 0; i++) {
      |  ^~~

Change the loop to correctly walk backwards through the
initialized fields rather than off into the woods.
