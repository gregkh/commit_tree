drm/amd/display: avoid uninitialized variable warning

clang (quite rightly) complains fairly loudly about the newly added
mpc1_get_mpc_out_mux() function returning an uninitialized value if the
'opp_id' checks don't pass.

This may not happen in practice, but the code really shouldn't return
garbage if the sanity checks don't pass.

So just initialize 'val' to zero to avoid the issue.
