staging: rtl8723bs: fix wireless regulatory API misuse

This code ends up calling wiphy_apply_custom_regulatory(), for which
we document that it should be called before wiphy_register(). This
driver doesn't do that, but calls it from ndo_open() with the RTNL
held, which caused deadlocks.

Since the driver just registers static regdomain data and then the
notifier applies the channel changes if any, there's no reason for
it to call this in ndo_open(), move it earlier to fix the deadlock.
