udp6: move the mss check after udp gso tunnel processing

For some protocol's gso, like SCTP, it's using GSO_BY_FRAGS for
gso_size. When using UDP to encapsulate its packet, it will
return error in udp6_ufo_fragment() as skb->len < gso_size,
and it will never go to the gso tunnel processing.

So we should move this check after udp gso tunnel processing,
the same as udp4_ufo_fragment() does.

v1->v2:
  - no change.
v2->v3:
  - not do any cleanup.
