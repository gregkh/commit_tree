staging: greybus: audio: Fix possible leak free widgets in gbaudio_dapm_free_controls

In gbaudio_dapm_free_controls(), if one of the widgets is not found, an error
will be returned directly, which will cause the rest to be unable to be freed,
resulting in leak.

This patch fixes the bug. If if one of them is not found, just skip and free the others.
