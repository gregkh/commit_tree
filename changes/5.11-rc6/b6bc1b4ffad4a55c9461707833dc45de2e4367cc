dt-bindings: iio: accel: bma255: Fix bmc150/bmi055 compatible

The bmc150-accel-i2c.c driver has an "_accel" suffix for the
compatibles of BMC150 and BMI055. This is necessary because BMC150
contains both accelerometer (bosch,bmc150_accel) and magnetometer
(bosch,bmc150_magn) and therefore "bosch,bmc150" would be ambiguous.

However, the binding documentation suggests using "bosch,bmc150".
Add the "_accel" suffix for BMC150 and BMI055 so the binding docs
match what is expected by the driver.
