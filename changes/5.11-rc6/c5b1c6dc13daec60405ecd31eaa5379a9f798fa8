mmc: sdhci: Update firmware interface API

The device_* calls were added a few years ago to abstract
DT/ACPI/fwnode firmware interfaces. Lets convert the two
sdhci caps fields to use the generic calls rather than the OF
specific ones. This has the side effect of allowing
ACPI based devices to quirk themselves when the caps field
is broken.
