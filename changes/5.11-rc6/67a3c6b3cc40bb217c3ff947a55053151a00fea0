i40e: acquire VSI pointer only after VF is initialized

This change simplifies the VF initialization check and also minimizes
the delay between acquiring the VSI pointer and using it. As known by
the commit being fixed, there is a risk of the VSI pointer getting
changed. Therefore minimize the delay between getting and using the
pointer.
