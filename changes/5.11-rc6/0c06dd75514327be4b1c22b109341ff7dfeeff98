mm, slab, slub: clear the slab_cache field when freeing page

The page allocator expects that page->mapping is NULL for a page being
freed.  SLAB and SLUB use the slab_cache field which is in union with
mapping, but before freeing the page, the field is referenced with the
"mapping" name when set to NULL.

It's IMHO more correct (albeit functionally the same) to use the
slab_cache name as that's the field we use in SL*B, and document why we
clear it in a comment (we don't clear fields such as s_mem or freelist, as
page allocator doesn't care about those).  While using the 'mapping' name
would automagically keep the code correct if the unions in struct page
changed, such changes should be done consciously and needed changes
evaluated - the comment should help with that.
