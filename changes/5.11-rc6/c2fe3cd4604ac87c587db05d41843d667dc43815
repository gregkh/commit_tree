KVM: x86: Move vendor CR4 validity check to dedicated kvm_x86_ops hook

Split out VMX's checks on CR4.VMXE to a dedicated hook, .is_valid_cr4(),
and invoke the new hook from kvm_valid_cr4().  This fixes an issue where
KVM_SET_SREGS would return success while failing to actually set CR4.

Fixing the issue by explicitly checking kvm_x86_ops.set_cr4()'s return
in __set_sregs() is not a viable option as KVM has already stuffed a
variety of vCPU state.

Note, kvm_valid_cr4() and is_valid_cr4() have different return types and
inverted semantics.  This will be remedied in a future patch.
