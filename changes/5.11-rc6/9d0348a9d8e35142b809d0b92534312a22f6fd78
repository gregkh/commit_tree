scsi: mpt3sas: Set valid PhysicalPort in SMPPassThrough

The driver currently sets PhysicalPort field to 0xFF for SMPPassthrough
Request message. In zoning topologies this SMPPassthrough command always
operates on devices in one zone (default zone) even when user issues SMP
command for other zone drives.

Define _transport_get_port_id_by_rphy() and
_transport_get_port_id_by_sas_phy() helper functions to get Physical Port
number from sas_rphy & sas_phy respectively for SMPPassthrough request
message so that SMP Passthrough request message is sent to intended zone
device.
