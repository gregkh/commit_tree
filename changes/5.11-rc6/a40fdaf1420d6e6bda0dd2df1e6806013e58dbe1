Revert "powerpc/pseries/hotplug-cpu: Remove double free in error path"

This reverts commit a0ff72f9f5a780341e7ff5e9ba50a0dad5fa1980.

Since the commit b015f6bc9547 ("powerpc/pseries: Add cpu DLPAR
support for drc-info property"), the 'cpu_drcs' wouldn't be double
freed when the 'cpus' node not found.

So we needn't apply this patch, otherwise, the memory will be leaked.
