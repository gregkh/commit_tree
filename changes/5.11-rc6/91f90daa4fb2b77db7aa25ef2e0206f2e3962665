platform-msi: Track shared domain allocation

We have two flavours of platform-MSI:

- MSIs generated by devices for themselves (the usual case)

- MSIs generated on behalf of other devices, as the generating
  device is some form of bridge (either a wire-to-MSI bridge,
  or even a non-transparent PCI bridge that repaints the PCI
  requester ID).

In the latter case, the underlying interrupt architecture may need
to track this in order to keep the mapping alive even when no MSI
are currently being generated.

Add a set of flags to the generic msi_alloc_info_t structure, as
well as the MSI_ALLOC_FLAGS_PROXY_DEVICE flag that will get
advertized by the platform-MSI code when allocating an irqdomain
for a device.
