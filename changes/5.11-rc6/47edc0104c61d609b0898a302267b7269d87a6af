soundwire: qcom: Fix build failure when slimbus is module

Commit 5bd773242f75 ("soundwire: qcom: avoid dependency on
CONFIG_SLIMBUS") removed hard dependency on Slimbus for qcom driver but
it results in build failure when: CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE_QCOM=y
CONFIG_SLIMBUS=m

drivers/soundwire/qcom.o: In function `qcom_swrm_probe':
qcom.c:(.text+0xf44): undefined reference to `slimbus_bus'

Fix this by using IS_REACHABLE() in driver which is recommended to be
used with imply.
