soundwire: registers: add definitions for clearable interrupt fields

DP0 has reserved fields and the read-only SDCA_CASCADE bit. We should
not try to write values in these fields, so add a formal definition
for clearable interrupts to be used in DP0 interrupt handling.

DPN also has reserved fields so add definitions for clearable
interrupts as well.
