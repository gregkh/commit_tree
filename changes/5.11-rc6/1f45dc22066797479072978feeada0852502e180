ibmvnic: continue fatal error reset after passive init

Commit f9c6cea0b385 ("ibmvnic: Skip fatal error reset after passive init")
says "If the passive
CRQ initialization occurs before the FATAL reset task is processed,
the FATAL error reset task would try to access a CRQ message queue
that was freed, causing an oops. The problem may be most likely to
occur during DLPAR add vNIC with a non-default MTU, because the DLPAR
process will automatically issue a change MTU request.
Fix this by not processing fatal error reset if CRQ is passively
initialized after client-driven CRQ initialization fails."

The original commit skips a specific reset condition, but that does
not fix the problem it claims to fix, and misses a reset condition.
The effective fix is commit 0e435befaea4 ("ibmvnic: fix NULL pointer
dereference in ibmvic_reset_crq") and commit a0faaa27c716 ("ibmvnic:
fix NULL pointer dereference in reset_sub_crq_queues"). With above
two fixes, there are no more crashes seen as described even without
the original commit, so I would like to revert the original commit.
