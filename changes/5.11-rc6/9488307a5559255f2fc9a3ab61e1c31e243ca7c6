habanalabs: prevent soft lockup during unmap

When using Deep learning framework such as tensorflow or pytorch, there
are tens of thousands of host memory mappings. When the user frees
all those mappings at the same time, the process of unmapping and
unpinning them can take a long time, which may cause a soft lockup
bug.

To prevent this, we need to free the core to do other things during
the unmapping process. For now, we chose to do it every 32K unmappings
(each unmap is a single 4K page).
