xfs: fix the forward progress assertion in xfs_iwalk_run_callbacks

In commit 27c14b5daa82 we started tracking the last inode seen during an
inode walk to avoid infinite loops if a corrupt inobt record happens to
have a lower ir_startino than the record preceeding it.  Unfortunately,
the assertion trips over the case where there are completely empty inobt
records (which can happen quite easily on 64k page filesystems) because
we advance the tracking cursor without actually putting the empty record
into the processing buffer.  Fix the assert to allow for this case.
