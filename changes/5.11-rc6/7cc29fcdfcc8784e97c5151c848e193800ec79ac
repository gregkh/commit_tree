drm/msm: a5xx: Make preemption reset case reentrant

nr_rings is reset to 1, but when this function is called for a second
(and third!) time nr_rings > 1 is false, thus the else case is entered
to set up a buffer for the RPTR shadow and consequently written to
RB_RPTR_ADDR, hanging platforms without WHERE_AM_I firmware support.

Restructure the condition in such a way that shadow buffer setup only
ever happens when has_whereami is true; otherwise preemption is only
finalized when the number of ring buffers has not been reset to 1 yet.
