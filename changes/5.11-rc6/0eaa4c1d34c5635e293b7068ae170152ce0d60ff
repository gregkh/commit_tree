ath11k: add processor_id based ring_selector logic

Current ring selector logic follows round-robin scheduling,
when a process switch from one processor to another each time,
the data in the cache would have to be invalidated
and re-loaded from RAM leads to poor cache utilization.

Therefore smp_processor_id() attempt to keep processes
on the same processor via processor affinity which improves
cache utilization. Also, ring selection could be chosen round
robin when the processor_id based ring selection does not
have the resources.
