mm/highmem: Provide and use CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL

CONFIG_KMAP_LOCAL can be enabled by x86/32bit even if CONFIG_HIGHMEM is not
enabled for temporary MMIO space mappings.

Provide it as a seperate config option which depends on CONFIG_KMAP_LOCAL
and let CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM select it.

This won't increase the debug coverage of this significantly but it paves
the way to do so.
