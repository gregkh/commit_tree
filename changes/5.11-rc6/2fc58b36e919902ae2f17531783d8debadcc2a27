usb: typec: tcpci_maxim: Fix vbus stuck on upon diconnecting sink

Occasionally, POWER_STATUS.sourcing_vbus takes a while to clear after
writing to  MAX_BUCK_BOOST_OP register. This causes vbus to turn back
on while disconnecting the sink. Overcome this issue by writing into
MAX_BUCK_BOOST_OP during frs while sourcing vbu, instead of always
into the register whenever POWER_STATUS.sourcing_vbus is set.
