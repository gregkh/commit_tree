perf test: Fix metric parsing test

Commit e1c92a7fbbc5 ("perf tests: Add another metric parsing test") add
another test for metric parsing. The test goes through all metrics
compiled for arch within pmu events and try to parse them.

Right now this test is failing in powerpc machine.

Result in power9 platform:

  [command]# ./perf test 10
  10: PMU events                                                      :
  10.1: PMU event table sanity                                        : Ok
  10.2: PMU event map aliases                                         : Ok
  10.3: Parsing of PMU event table metrics                            : Skip (some metrics failed)
  10.4: Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs             : FAILED!

Issue is we are passing different runtime parameter value in
"expr__find_other" and "expr__parse" function which is called from
function `metric_parse_fake`.  And because of this parsing of hv-24x7
metrics is failing.

  [command]# ./perf test 10 -vv
  .....
  hv_24x7/pm_mcs01_128b_rd_disp_port01,chip=1/ not found
  expr__parse failed
  test child finished with -1
  ---- end ----
  PMU events subtest 4: FAILED!

This patch fix this issue and change runtime parameter value to '0' in
expr__parse function.

Result in power9 platform after this patch:

  [command]# ./perf test 10
  10: PMU events                                                      :
  10.1: PMU event table sanity                                        : Ok
  10.2: PMU event map aliases                                         : Ok
  10.3: Parsing of PMU event table metrics                            : Skip (some metrics failed)
  10.4: Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs             : Ok
