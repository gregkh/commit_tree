ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix a few more UBSAN fixes

There are a few places that call round{up|down}_pow_of_two() with the
value zero, and this causes undefined behavior warnings.  Avoid
calling those macros if such a nonsense value is passed; it's a minor
optimization as well, as we handle it as either an error or a value to
be skipped, instead.
