driver core: platform: change logic implementing platform_driver_probe

Instead of overwriting the core driver's probe function handle probing
devices for drivers loaded by platform_driver_probe() in the platform
driver probe function.

The intended goal is to not have to change the probe function to
simplify converting the platform bus to use bus functions.
