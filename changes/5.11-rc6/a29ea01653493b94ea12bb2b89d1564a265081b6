s390/dasd: prevent inconsistent LCU device data

Prevent _lcu_update from adding a device to a pavgroup if the LCU still
requires an update. The data is not reliable any longer and in parallel
devices might have been moved on the lists already.
This might lead to list corruptions or invalid PAV grouping.
Only add devices to a pavgroup if the LCU is up to date. Additional steps
are taken by the scheduled lcu update.
