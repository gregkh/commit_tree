ALSA: usb-audio: Refactoring endpoint URB deactivation

Minor code refactoring to consolidate the URB deactivation code in
endpoint.c.  A slight behavior change is that the error handling in
snd_usb_endpoint_start() leaves EP_FLAG_STOPPING now.  This should be
synced with the later PCM sync_stop callback.
