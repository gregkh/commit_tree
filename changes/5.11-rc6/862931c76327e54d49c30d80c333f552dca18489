btrfs: introduce max_zone_append_size

The zone append write command has a maximum IO size restriction it
accepts. This is because a zone append write command cannot be split, as
we ask the device to place the data into a specific target zone and the
device responds with the actual written location of the data.

Introduce max_zone_append_size to zone_info and fs_info to track the
value, so we can limit all I/O to a zoned block device that we want to
write using the zone append command to the device's limits.
