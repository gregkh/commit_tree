m68k: sun3/sun3c: use legacy_timer_tick

These two are different from all other machines:

* sun3 does not call timer_routine() but open-codes it
  except for the profile_tick() call that appears to
  be unintentionally missing.

* sun3x has a commented-out timer irq handler but no
  functional timer tick I could find.

Change both to calling the new legacy_timer_tick here,
which includes the call to profile_tick() but does not
fix sun3x as that is still commented out.
