scsi: ufs: Fix -Wsometimes-uninitialized warning

clang complains about a possible code path in which a variable is used
without an initialization:

drivers/scsi/ufs/ufshcd.c:7690:3: error: variable 'sdp' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
                BUG_ON(1);
                ^~~~~~~~~
include/asm-generic/bug.h:63:36: note: expanded from macro 'BUG_ON'
 #define BUG_ON(condition) do { if (unlikely(condition)) BUG(); } while (0)
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turn the BUG_ON(1) into an unconditional BUG() that makes it clear to clang
that this code path is never hit.
