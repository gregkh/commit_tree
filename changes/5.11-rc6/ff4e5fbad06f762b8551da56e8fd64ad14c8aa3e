nvme-pci: drop min() from nr_io_queues assignment

in nvme_setup_io_queues() the number of I/O queues is set to either 1 in
case of a quirky Apple device or to the min of nvme_max_io_queues() or
dev->nr_allocated_queues - 1.
This is unnecessarily complicated as dev->nr_allocated_queues is only
assigned once and is nvme_max_io_queues() + 1.
