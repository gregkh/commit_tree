arm64: mm: make vmemmap region a projection of the linear region

Now that we have reverted the introduction of the vmemmap struct page
pointer and the separate physvirt_offset, we can simplify things further,
and place the vmemmap region in the VA space in such a way that virtual
to page translations and vice versa can be implemented using a single
arithmetic shift.

One happy coincidence resulting from this is that the 48-bit/4k and
52-bit/64k configurations (which are assumed to be the two most
prevalent) end up with the same placement of the vmemmap region. In
a subsequent patch, we will take advantage of this, and unify the
memory maps even more.
