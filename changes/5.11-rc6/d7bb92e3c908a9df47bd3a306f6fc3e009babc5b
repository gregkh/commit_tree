phy: mediatek: Make PHY_MTK_{XSPHY, TPHY} depend on HAS_IOMEM and OF_ADDRESS to fix build errors

devm_ioremap_resource() will be not built in lib/devres.c if
CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is not set, of_address_to_resource() will be
not built in drivers/of/address.c if CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS is not
set, and then there exists two build errors about undefined
reference to "devm_ioremap_resource" and "of_address_to_resource"
in phy-mtk-xsphy.c under COMPILE_TEST and CONFIG_PHY_MTK_XSPHY,
make PHY_MTK_XSPHY depend on HAS_IOMEM and OF_ADDRESS to fix it.

The above issue is reported by kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>,
through the discussion in the v1 patch, as Chunfeng said we need
also do this for config PHY_MTK_TPHY:

drivers/phy/mediatek/phy-mtk-tphy.c:1157:		retval = of_address_to_resource(child_np, 0, &res);
drivers/phy/mediatek/phy-mtk-tphy.c:1123:		tphy->sif_base = devm_ioremap_resource(dev, sif_res);
drivers/phy/mediatek/phy-mtk-tphy.c:1164:		instance->port_base = devm_ioremap_resource(&phy->dev, &res);
