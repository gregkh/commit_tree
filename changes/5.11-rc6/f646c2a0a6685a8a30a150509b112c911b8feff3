PCI: Return u8 from pci_find_capability() and similar

PCI Capabilities are linked in a list that must appear in the first 256
bytes of config space.  Each capabilities list pointer is 8 bits.

Change the return type of pci_find_capability() and supporting functions
from int to u8 to match the specification.
