RDMA: Check create_flags during create_qp

Each driver should check that the QP attrs create_flags is supported.
Unfortuantely when create_flags was added to the QP attrs the drivers were
not updated. uverbs_ex_cmd_mask was used to block it - even though kernel
drivers use these flags too.

Check that flags is zero in all drivers that don't use it, remove
IB_USER_VERBS_EX_CMD_CREATE_QP from uverbs_ex_cmd_mask. Fix the error code
to be EOPNOTSUPP.
