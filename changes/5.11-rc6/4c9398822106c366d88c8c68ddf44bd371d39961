PCI: qcom: Add support for configuring BDF to SID mapping for SM8250

For SM8250, we need to write the BDF to SID mapping in PCIe controller
register space for proper working. This is accomplished by extracting
the BDF and SID values from "iommu-map" property in DT and writing those
in the register address calculated from the hash value of BDF. In case
of collisions, the index of the next entry will also be written.

For the sake of it, let's introduce a "config_sid" callback and do it
conditionally for SM8250.
