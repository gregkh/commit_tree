HID: wacom: Correct NULL dereference on AES pen proximity

The recent commit to fix a memory leak introduced an inadvertant NULL
pointer dereference. The `wacom_wac->pen_fifo` variable was never
intialized, resuling in a crash whenever functions tried to use it.
Since the FIFO is only used by AES pens (to buffer events from pen
proximity until the hardware reports the pen serial number) this would
have been easily overlooked without testing an AES device.

This patch converts `wacom_wac->pen_fifo` over to a pointer (since the
call to `devres_alloc` allocates memory for us) and ensures that we assign
it to point to the allocated and initalized `pen_fifo` before the function
returns.
