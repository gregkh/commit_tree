x86/cpu: Avoid cpuinfo-induced IPIing of idle CPUs

Currently, accessing /proc/cpuinfo sends IPIs to idle CPUs in order to
learn their clock frequency.  Which is a bit strange, given that waking
them from idle likely significantly changes their clock frequency.
This commit therefore avoids sending /proc/cpuinfo-induced IPIs to
idle CPUs.
