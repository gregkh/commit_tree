bpf: selftest: Use bpf_sk_storage in FENTRY/FEXIT/RAW_TP

This patch tests storing the task's related info into the
bpf_sk_storage by fentry/fexit tracing at listen, accept,
and connect.  It also tests the raw_tp at inet_sock_set_state.

A negative test is done by tracing the bpf_sk_storage_free()
and using bpf_sk_storage_get() at the same time.  It ensures
this bpf program cannot load.
