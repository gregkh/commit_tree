xsk: Clear pool even for inactive queues

The number of queues can change by other means, rather than ethtool. For
example, attaching an mqprio qdisc with num_tc > 1 leads to creating
multiple sets of TX queues, which may be then destroyed when mqprio is
deleted. If an AF_XDP socket is created while mqprio is active,
dev->_tx[queue_id].pool will be filled, but then real_num_tx_queues may
decrease with deletion of mqprio, which will mean that the pool won't be
NULLed, and a further increase of the number of TX queues may expose a
dangling pointer.

To avoid any potential misbehavior, this commit clears pool for RX and
TX queues, regardless of real_num_*_queues, still taking into
consideration num_*_queues to avoid overflows.
