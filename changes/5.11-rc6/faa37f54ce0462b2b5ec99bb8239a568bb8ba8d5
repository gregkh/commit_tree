drm/amd/display: Expose modifiers.

This expose modifier support on GFX9+.

Only modifiers that can be rendered on the current GPU are
added. This is to reduce the number of modifiers exposed.

The HW could expose more, but the best mechanism to decide
what to expose without an explosion in modifiers is still
to be decided, and in the meantime this should not regress
things from pre-modifiers and does not risk regressions as
we make up our mind in the future.

v2:
  - Added comment that D on Raven is only valid for 64bpp
    and will be filtered based on format later.
  - Removed D tiling modes that weren't useful for 64bpp
    on GFX10+.

v4: Add AMDGPU_FAMILY_VGH case.
