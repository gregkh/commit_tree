sh_eth: Fix power down vs. is_opened flag ordering

sh_eth_close() does a synchronous power down of the device before
marking it closed.  Revert the order, to make sure the device is never
marked opened while suspended.

While at it, use pm_runtime_put() instead of pm_runtime_put_sync(), as
there is no reason to do a synchronous power down.
