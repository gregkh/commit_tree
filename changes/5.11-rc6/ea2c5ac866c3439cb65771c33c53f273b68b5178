pcmcia: Remove NEC VRC4173 CARDU

The driver was introduced in 2.6.11 in the pre-git times with commit
"[PATCH] mips: vR41xx updates". However, even back then, this driver
was not able to be compiled, as a number of udpates had been missing
from this driver: It still provided a "->get_io_map" callback (removed
for v2.5.66) and a "->inquire_socket" callback and used socket_cap_t
(removed for v2.5.72). Moreover, this driver failed to be brought and
be kept up to date; e.g. it still provides '->register_callback',
incompatible with a change committed for v2.6.14 in
commit 7f316b033b36 ("[PATCH] pcmcia: remove socket register_callback"),
and uses INIT_WORK() with three arguments which was removed in
commit 65f27f38446e1 ("WorkStruct: Pass the work_struct pointer instead
of context data")
