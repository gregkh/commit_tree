MIPS: SMP-CPS: Add support for irq migration when CPU offline

Currently we won't migrate irqs when offline CPUs, which has been
implemented on most architectures. That will lead to some devices work
incorrectly if the bound cores are offline.

While that can be easily supported by enabling GENERIC_IRQ_MIGRATION.
But i don't pretty known the reason it was not supported on all MIPS
platforms.

This patch add the support for irq migration on MIPS CPS platform, and
it's tested on the interAptiv processor.
