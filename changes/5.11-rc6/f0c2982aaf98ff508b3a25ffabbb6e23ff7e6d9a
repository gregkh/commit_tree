octeontx2-pf: Add support for SR-IOV management functions

This patch adds support for ndo_set_vf_mac, ndo_set_vf_vlan
and ndo_get_vf_config handlers. The traffic redirection
based on the VF mac address or vlan id is done by installing
MCAM rules. Reserved RX_VTAG_TYPE7 in each NIXLF for VF VLAN
which strips the VLAN tag from ingress VLAN traffic. The NIX PF
allocates two MCAM entries for VF VLAN feature, one used for
ingress VTAG strip and another entry for egress VTAG insertion.

This patch also updates the MAC address in PF installed VF VLAN
rule upon receiving nix_lf_start_rx mbox request for VF since
Administrative Function driver will assign a valid MAC addr
in nix_lf_start_rx function.
