arm64: consistently use reserved_pg_dir

Depending on configuration options and specific code paths, we either
use the empty_zero_page or the configuration-dependent reserved_ttbr0
as a reserved value for TTBR{0,1}_EL1.

To simplify this code, let's always allocate and use the same
reserved_pg_dir, replacing reserved_ttbr0. Note that this is allocated
(and hence pre-zeroed), and is also marked as read-only in the kernel
Image mapping.

Keeping this separate from the empty_zero_page potentially helps with
robustness as the empty_zero_page is used in a number of cases where a
failure to map it read-only could allow it to become corrupted.

The (presently unused) swapper_pg_end symbol is also removed, and
comments are added wherever we rely on the offsets between the
pre-allocated pg_dirs to keep these cases easily identifiable.
