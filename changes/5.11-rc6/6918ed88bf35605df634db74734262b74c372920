dt-bindings:iio:dac:adi,ad7303 yaml conversion

Converted to maintain the requirement for Vdd-supply as per original file.
It is possible we could relax this requirement to make it at least one
of Vdd-supply and REF-supply.  We need to establish the scaling of the
output channel and if REF-supply is provided that is used instead of
Vdd-supply, hence I cannot see why a dummy regulator cannot be used for
Vdd-supply if this happens.

For now, let us keep it simple.

Drop adi,use-external-reference from binding example as no such binding
exists.
