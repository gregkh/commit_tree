ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Change get_sr() and get_wss() to be more explicit

We are actually using a complex formula to just return a bunch of
simple values. Also this formula is wrong for sun4i when calling
get_wss() the function return 4 instead of 3.

Replace this with a simpler switch case.

Also drop the i2s params which is unused and return a simple int as
returning an error code could be out of range for an s8 and there is
no optim to return a s8 here.
