s390/ctcm: Avoid temporary allocation of struct th_header and th_sweep.

The size of struct th_header is 8 byte and the size of struct th_sweep
is 16 byte. The memory for is allocated, initialized, used and
deallocated a few lines later.

It is more efficient to avoid the allocation/free dance and assign the
values directly to skb's data part instead of using memcpy() for it.

Avoid an allocation of struct th_sweep/th_header and use the resulting
skb pointer instead.
