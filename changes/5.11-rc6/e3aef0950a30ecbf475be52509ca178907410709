nvme-pci: don't allocate unused I/O queues

currently the NVME_QUIRK_SHARED_TAGS quirk for Apple devices is handled
during the assignment of nr_io_queues in nvme_setup_io_queues().
This however means that for these devices nvme_max_io_queues() will
actually not return the supported maximum which is confusing and
unexpected and also means that in nvme_probe() we are allocating
for I/O queues that will never be used.
Fix this by moving the quirk handling into nvme_max_io_queues().
