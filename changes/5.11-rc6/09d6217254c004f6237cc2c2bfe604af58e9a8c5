net: openvswitch: fix TTL decrement exception action execution

Currently, the exception actions are not processed correctly as the wrong
dataset is passed. This change fixes this, including the misleading
comment.

In addition, a check was added to make sure we work on an IPv4 packet,
and not just assume if it's not IPv6 it's IPv4.

This was all tested using OVS with patch,
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openvswitch/list/?series=21639,
applied and sending packets with a TTL of 1 (and 0), both with IPv4
and IPv6.
