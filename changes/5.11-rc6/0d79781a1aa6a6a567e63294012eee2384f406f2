xfs: improve the code that checks recovered refcount intent items

The code that validates recovered refcount intent items is kind of a
mess -- it doesn't use the standard xfs type validators, and it doesn't
check for things that it should.  Fix the validator function to use the
standard validation helpers and look for more types of obvious errors.
