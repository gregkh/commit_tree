ACPI: scan: Fix up _DEP-related terminology with supplier/consumer

The ACPI namespace scanning code uses the terms master/slave when
populating the list of _DEP dependencies, but that use has no
external exposures and is not mandated by nor associated with any
external specifications.

Change the language used through-out to supplier/consumer.

No functional impact.
