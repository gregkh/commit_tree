iommu: return error code when it can't get group

Although iommu_group_get() in iommu_probe_device() will always succeed
thanks to __iommu_probe_device() creating the group if it's not present,
it's still worth initialising 'ret' to -ENODEV in case this path is
reachable in the future.

For now, this patch results in no functional change.
