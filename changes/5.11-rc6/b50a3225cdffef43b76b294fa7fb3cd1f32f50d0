arm64/head: avoid symbol names pointing into first 64 KB of kernel image

We no longer map the first 64 KB of the kernel image, as there is nothing
there that we ever need to refer back to once the kernel has booted. Even
though facilities like kallsyms are very careful to only refer to the
region that starts at _stext when mapping virtual addresses to symbol
names, let's avoid any confusion by switching to local .L prefixed symbol
names for the EFI header, as none of them have any significance to the
rest of the kernel.
