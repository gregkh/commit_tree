ALSA: fireface: Fix integer overflow in transmit_midi_msg()

As snd_ff.rx_bytes[] is unsigned int, and NSEC_PER_SEC is 1000000000L,
the second multiplication in

    ff->rx_bytes[port] * 8 * NSEC_PER_SEC / 31250

always overflows on 32-bit platforms, truncating the result.  Fix this
by precalculating "NSEC_PER_SEC / 31250", which is an integer constant.

Note that this assumes ff->rx_bytes[port] <= 16777.
