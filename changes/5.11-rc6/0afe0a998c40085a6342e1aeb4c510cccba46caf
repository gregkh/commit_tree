samples: bpf: Fix lwt_len_hist reusing previous BPF map

Currently, lwt_len_hist's map lwt_len_hist_map is uses pinning, and the
map isn't cleared on test end. This leds to reuse of that map for
each test, which prevents the results of the test from being accurate.

This commit fixes the problem by removing of pinned map from bpffs.
Also, this commit add the executable permission to shell script
files.
