bpf: Augment the set of sleepable LSM hooks

Update the set of sleepable hooks with the ones that do not trigger
a warning with might_fault() when exercised with the correct kernel
config options enabled, i.e.

	DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y
	LOCKDEP=y
	PROVE_LOCKING=y

This means that a sleepable LSM eBPF program can be attached to these
LSM hooks. A new helper method bpf_lsm_is_sleepable_hook is added and
the set is maintained locally in bpf_lsm.c
