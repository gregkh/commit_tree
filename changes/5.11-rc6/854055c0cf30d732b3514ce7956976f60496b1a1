selftests/bpf: Fix flavored variants of test_ima

Flavored variants of test_progs (e.g. test_progs-no_alu32) change their
working directory to the corresponding subdirectory (e.g. no_alu32).
Since the setup script required by test_ima (ima_setup.sh) is not
mentioned in the dependencies, it does not get copied to these
subdirectories and causes flavored variants of test_ima to fail.

Adding the script to TRUNNER_EXTRA_FILES ensures that the file is also
copied to the subdirectories for the flavored variants of test_progs.
