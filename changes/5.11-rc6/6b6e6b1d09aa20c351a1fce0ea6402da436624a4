libbpf: Accomodate DWARF/compiler bug with duplicated identical arrays

In some cases compiler seems to generate distinct DWARF types for identical
arrays within the same CU. That seems like a bug, but it's already out there
and breaks type graph equivalence checks, so accommodate it anyway by checking
for identical arrays, regardless of their type ID.
