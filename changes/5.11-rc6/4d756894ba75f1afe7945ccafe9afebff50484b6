powerpc/rtas: dispatch partition migration requests to pseries

sys_rtas() cannot call ibm,suspend-me directly in the same way it
handles other inputs. Instead it must dispatch the request to code
that can first perform the H_JOIN sequence before any call to
ibm,suspend-me can succeed. Over time kernel/rtas.c has accreted a fair
amount of platform-specific code to implement this.

Since a different, more robust implementation of the suspend sequence
is now in the pseries platform code, we want to dispatch the request
there.

Note that invoking ibm,suspend-me via the RTAS syscall is all but
deprecated; this change preserves ABI compatibility for old programs
while providing to them the benefit of the new partition suspend
implementation. This is a behavior change in that the kernel performs
the device tree update and firmware activation before returning, but
experimentation indicates this is tolerated fine by legacy user space.
