ALSA: usb-audio: Drop debug.h

The file debug.h contains a simple macro for debug prints, and it's
used only in two places, the format parser and the hw_params rules.
The former actually should print a more informative message instead,
so the only users are the hw_parmas rules.

This patch moves the contents of debug.h into the hw_params rules
local code and remove the unneeded includes.  Also, the debug print in
the format parser is replaced with the information print with more
useful information, and the raw printk() call is replaced with
pr_debug().
