ep_send_events_proc(): fold into the caller

... and get rid of struct ep_send_events_data - not needed anymore.
The weird way of passing the arguments in (and real return value
out - nominal return value of ep_send_events_proc() is ignored)
was due to the signature forced on ep_scan_ready_list() callbacks.
