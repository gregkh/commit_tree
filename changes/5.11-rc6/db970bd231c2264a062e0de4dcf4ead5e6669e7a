x86/CPU/AMD: Remove amd_get_nb_id()

The Last Level Cache ID is returned by amd_get_nb_id(). In practice,
this value is the same as the AMD NodeId for callers of this function.
The NodeId is saved in struct cpuinfo_x86.cpu_die_id.

Replace calls to amd_get_nb_id() with the logical CPU's cpu_die_id and
remove the function.
