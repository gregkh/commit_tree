Revert "drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Use rcuidle tracepoints for rpmh"

Commit efde2659b0fe ("drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Use rcuidle tracepoints
for rpmh") was written to fix a bug seen in an unmerged series that
implemented a struct generic_pm_domain::power_off() callback calling
rpmh_flush(). See stack trace below.

     Call trace:
      dump_backtrace+0x0/0x174
      show_stack+0x20/0x2c
      dump_stack+0xc8/0x124
      lockdep_rcu_suspicious+0xe4/0x104
      __tcs_buffer_write+0x230/0x2d0
      rpmh_rsc_write_ctrl_data+0x210/0x270
      rpmh_flush+0x84/0x24c
      rpmh_domain_power_off+0x78/0x98
      _genpd_power_off+0x40/0xc0
      genpd_power_off+0x168/0x208

Later the final merged solution is to use CPU PM notification to invoke
rpmh_flush() and power_off() callback of genpd is not implemented in the
driver.

CPU PM notifiers are run with RCU enabled/watching (see cpu_pm_notify()
and how it calls rcu_irq_enter_irqson() before calling the notifiers).

Remove this change since RCU will not be idle during CPU PM notifications
hence not required to use _rcuidle tracepoint. Using _rcuidle tracepoint
prevented rpmh driver to be loadable module as these are not exported
symbols.

This reverts commit efde2659b0fe835732047357b2902cca14f054d9.
