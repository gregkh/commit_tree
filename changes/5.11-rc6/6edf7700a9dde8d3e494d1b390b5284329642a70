phy: qcom-qmp: Add SM8250 PCIe QMP PHYs

SM8250 has multiple different PHY versions:
QMP GEN3x1 PHY - 1 lane
QMP GEN3x2 PHY - 2 lanes
QMP Modem PHY - 2 lanes

Add support for these with relevant init sequence. In order to abstract
the init sequence, this commit introduces secondary tables which can
be used to factor out the unique sequence for each PHY while the former
tables can have the common sequence.
