tomoyo: Limit wildcard recursion depth.

Since wildcards that need recursion consume kernel stack memory (or might
cause CPU stall warning problem), we cannot allow infinite recursion.

Since TOMOYO 1.8 survived with 20 recursions limit for 5 years, nobody
would complain if applying this limit to TOMOYO 2.6.
