scsi: qla2xxx: Drop TARGET_SCF_LOOKUP_LUN_FROM_TAG

Only the __qlt_24xx_handle_abts() code path does not know the LUN for an
abort and it uses the TARGET_SCF_LOOKUP_LUN_FROM_TAG flag to have LIO core
look it up. LIO uses target_lookup_lun_from_tag to go from cmd tag to LUN
for the driver. However, qla2xxx has a tcm_qla2xxx_find_cmd_by_tag() which
does almost the same thing as the LIO helper (it finds the cmd but does not
return the LUN). This patch has qla2xxx use its internal helper.
