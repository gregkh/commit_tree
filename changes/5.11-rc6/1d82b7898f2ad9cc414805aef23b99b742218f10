arch: move SA_* definitions to generic headers

Most architectures with the exception of alpha, mips, parisc and
sparc use the same values for these flags. Move their definitions into
asm-generic/signal-defs.h and allow the architectures with non-standard
values to override them. Also, document the non-standard flag values
in order to make it easier to add new generic flags in the future.

A consequence of this change is that on powerpc and x86, the constants'
values aside from SA_RESETHAND change signedness from unsigned
to signed. This is not expected to impact realistic use of these
constants. In particular the typical use of the constants where they
are or'ed together and assigned to sa_flags (or another int variable)
would not be affected.
