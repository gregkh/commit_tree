rndis_host: set proper input size for OID_GEN_PHYSICAL_MEDIUM request

MSFT ActiveSync implementation requires that the size of the response for
incoming query is to be provided in the request input length. Failure to
set the input size proper results in failed request transfer, where the
ActiveSync counterpart reports the NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_LENGTH (0xC0010014L)
error.

Set the input size for OID_GEN_PHYSICAL_MEDIUM query to the expected size
of the response in order for the ActiveSync to properly respond to the
request.
