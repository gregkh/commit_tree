selftests/bpf: Drop the need for LLVM's llc

LLC is meant for compiler development and debugging. Consequently, it
exposes many low level options about its backend. To avoid future bugs
introduced by using the raw LLC tool, use clang directly so that all
appropriate options are passed to the back end.

Additionally, simplify the Makefile by removing the
CLANG_NATIVE_BPF_BUILD_RULE as it is not being use, stop passing
dwarfris attr since elfutils/libdw now supports the bpf backend (which
should work with any recent pahole), and stop passing alu32 since
-mcpu=v3 implies alu32.
