net/mlx5: Treat host PF vport as other (non eswitch manager) vport

When eswitch manager is running on ECPF, host PF should be treated
as non eswitch manager port, similar to other VF vports.
Fail to do so, results in firmware treating PF's vport as ECPF
vport for eswitch ACL tables.
Non zero check to figure out if a given vport is other vport or not
is not sufficient becase PF vport number = 0 on ECPF.
Hence, create esw acl tables with an attribute of other vport.
