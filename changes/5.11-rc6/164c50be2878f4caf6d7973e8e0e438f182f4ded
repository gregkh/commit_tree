userfaultfd/selftests: always dump something in modes

Patch series "userfaultfd: selftests: Small fixes".

Some very trivial fixes that I kept locally to userfaultfd selftest
program.

This patch (of 3):

BOUNCE_POLL is a special bit that if cleared it means "READ" instead.
Dump that too otherwise we'll see tests with empty modes.
