selftests/bpf: Test bpf_sk_storage_get in tcp iterators

This extends the existing bpf_sk_storage_get test where a socket is
created and tagged with its creator's pid by a task_file iterator.

A TCP iterator is now also used at the end of the test to negate the
values already stored in the local storage. The test therefore expects
-getpid() to be stored in the local storage.
