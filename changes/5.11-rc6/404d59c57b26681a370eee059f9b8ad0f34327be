PM / devfreq: exynos-bus: Add registration of interconnect child device

This patch adds registration of a child platform device for the exynos
interconnect driver. It is assumed that the interconnect provider will
only be needed when #interconnect-cells property is present in the bus
DT node, hence the child device will be created only when such a property
is present.
