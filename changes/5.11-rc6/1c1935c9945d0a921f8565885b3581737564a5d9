octeontx2-af: Add NIX1 interfaces to NPC

On 98xx silicon, NPC block has additional
mcam entries, counters and NIX1 interfaces.
Extended set of registers are present for the
new mcam entries and counters.
This patch does the following:
- updates the register accessing macros
  to use extended set if present.
- configures the MKEX profile for NIX1 interfaces also.
- updates mcam entry write functions to use assigned
  NIX0/1 interfaces for the PF/VF.
