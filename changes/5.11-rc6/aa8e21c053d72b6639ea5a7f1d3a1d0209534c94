powerpc/perf: Exclude kernel samples while counting events in user space.

Perf event attritube supports exclude_kernel flag to avoid
sampling/profiling in supervisor state (kernel). Based on this event
attr flag, Monitor Mode Control Register bit is set to freeze on
supervisor state. But sometimes (due to hardware limitation), Sampled
Instruction Address Register (SIAR) locks on to kernel address even
when freeze on supervisor is set. Patch here adds a check to drop
those samples.
