habanalabs: use enum for CB allocation options

In the future there will be situations where queues can accept either
kernel allocated CBs or user allocated CBs, depending on different
states.

Therefore, instead of using a boolean variable of kernel/user allocated
CB, we need to use a bitmask to indicate that, which will allow to
combine the two options.

Add a flag to the uapi so the user will be able to indicate whether
the CB was allocated by kernel or by user. Of course the driver
validates that.
