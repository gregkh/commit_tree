selftests/vm: run_vmtests.sh: update and clean up gup_test invocation

Run benchmarks on the _fast variants of gup and pup, as originally

Run the new gup_test sub-test: dump pages.  In addition to exercising the
dump_page() call, it also demonstrates the various options you can use to
specify which pages to dump, and how.
