bpf: Add in-kernel split BTF support

Adjust in-kernel BTF implementation to support a split BTF mode of operation.
Changes are mostly mirroring libbpf split BTF changes, with the exception of
start_id being 0 for in-kernel implementation due to simpler read-only mode.

Otherwise, for split BTF logic, most of the logic of jumping to base BTF,
where necessary, is encapsulated in few helper functions. Type numbering and
string offset in a split BTF are logically continuing where base BTF ends, so
most of the high-level logic is kept without changes.

Type verification and size resolution is only doing an added resolution of new
split BTF types and relies on already cached size and type resolution results
in the base BTF.
