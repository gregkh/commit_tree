io_uring: add timeout support for io_uring_enter()

Now users who want to get woken when waiting for events should submit a
timeout command first. It is not safe for applications that split SQ and
CQ handling between two threads, such as mysql. Users should synchronize
the two threads explicitly to protect SQ and that will impact the
performance.

This patch adds support for timeout to existing io_uring_enter(). To
avoid overloading arguments, it introduces a new parameter structure
which contains sigmask and timeout.

I have tested the workloads with one thread submiting nop requests
while the other reaping the cqe with timeout. It shows 1.8~2x faster
when the iodepth is 16.
