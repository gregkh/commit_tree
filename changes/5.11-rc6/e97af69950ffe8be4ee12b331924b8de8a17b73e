mm/swap_state: skip meaningless swap cache readahead when ra_info.win == 0

swap_ra_info() may leave ra_info untouched in non_swap_entry() case as
page table lock is not held.  In this case, we have ra_info.nr_pte == 0
and it is meaningless to continue with swap cache readahead.  Skip such
ops by init ra_info.win = 1.
