soc: qcom: geni: Optimize/comment select fifo/dma mode

The functions geni_se_select_fifo_mode() and
geni_se_select_fifo_mode() are a little funny.  They read/write a
bunch of memory mapped registers even if they don't change or aren't
relevant for the current protocol.  Let's make them a little more
sane.  We'll also add a comment explaining why we don't do some of the
operations for UART.

NOTE: there is no evidence at all that this makes any performance
difference and it fixes no bugs.  However, it seems (to me) like it
makes the functions a little easier to understand.  Decreasing the
amount of times we read/write memory mapped registers is also nice,
even if we are using "relaxed" variants.
