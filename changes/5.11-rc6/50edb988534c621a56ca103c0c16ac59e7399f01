srcu: Take early exit on memory-allocation failure

It turns out that init_srcu_struct() can be invoked from usermode tasks,
and that fatal signals received by these tasks can cause memory-allocation
failures.  These failures are not handled well by init_srcu_struct(),
so much so that NULL pointer dereferences can result.  This commit
therefore causes init_srcu_struct() to take an early exit upon detection
of memory-allocation failure.
