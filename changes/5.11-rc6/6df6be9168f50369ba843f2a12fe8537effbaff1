scsi: mpt3sas: Get sas_device objects using device's rphy

In the following scsi_host_template and sas_function_template callback
functions the driver does not have PhysicalPort number information to
retrieve the sas_device object using SAS Address & PhysicalPort number. In
these callback functions the device's rphy object is used to retrieve
sas_device object for the device.

.target_alloc,
.get_enclosure_identifier
.get_bay_identifier

When a rphy (of type sas_rphy) object is allocated then its address is
saved in corresponding sas_device object's rphy field. In
__mpt3sas_get_sdev_by_rphy(), the driver loops over all the sas_device
objects from sas_device_list list to retrieve the sas_device objects whose
rphy matches the provided rphy.
