regulator: axp20x: Fix DLDO2 voltage control register mask for AXP22x

When I use the axp20x chip to power my SDIO device on the 5.4 kernel,
the output voltage of DLDO2 is wrong. After comparing the register
manual and source code of the chip, I found that the mask bit of the
driver register of the port was wrong. I fixed this error by modifying
the mask register of the source code. This error seems to be a copy
error of the macro when writing the code. Now the voltage output of
the DLDO2 port of axp20x is correct. My development environment is
Allwinner A40I of arm architecture, and the kernel version is 5.4.
