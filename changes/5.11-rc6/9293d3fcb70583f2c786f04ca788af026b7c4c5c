RDMA/hns: Use mutex instead of spinlock for ida allocation

GFP_KERNEL may cause ida_alloc_range() to sleep, but the spinlock covering
this function is not allowed to sleep, so the spinlock needs to be changed
to mutex.

As there is a certain chance of memory allocation failure, GFP_ATOMIC is
not suitable for QP allocation scenarios.
