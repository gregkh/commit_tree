btrfs: no need to run delayed refs after commit_fs_roots during commit

The inode number cache has been removed in this dev cycle, there's one
more leftover. We don't need to run the delayed refs again after
commit_fs_roots as stated in the comment, because btrfs_save_ino_cache
is no more since 5297199a8bca ("btrfs: remove inode number cache
feature").

Nothing else between commit_fs_roots and btrfs_qgroup_account_extents
could create new delayed refs so the qgroup consistency should be safe.
