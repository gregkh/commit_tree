powerpc/feature: Fix CPU_FTRS_ALWAYS by removing CPU_FTRS_GENERIC_32

On 8xx, we get the following features:

[    0.000000] cpu_features      = 0x0000000000000100
[    0.000000]   possible        = 0x0000000000000120
[    0.000000]   always          = 0x0000000000000000

This is not correct. As CONFIG_PPC_8xx is mutually exclusive with all
other configurations, the three lines should be equal.

The problem is due to CPU_FTRS_GENERIC_32 which is taken when
CONFIG_BOOK3S_32 is NOT selected. This CPU_FTRS_GENERIC_32 is
pointless because there is no generic configuration supporting
all 32 bits but book3s/32.

Remove this pointless generic features definition to unbreak the
calculation of 'possible' features and 'always' features.
