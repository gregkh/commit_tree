KVM: arm64: Intercept host's CPU_ON SMCs

Add a handler of the CPU_ON PSCI call from host. When invoked, it looks
up the logical CPU ID corresponding to the provided MPIDR and populates
the state struct of the target CPU with the provided x0, pc. It then
calls CPU_ON itself, with an entry point in hyp that initializes EL2
state before returning ERET to the provided PC in EL1.

There is a simple atomic lock around the boot args struct. If it is
already locked, CPU_ON will return PENDING_ON error code.
