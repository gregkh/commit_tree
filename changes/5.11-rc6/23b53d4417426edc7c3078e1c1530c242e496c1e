ALSA: pcm: One more dependency for hw constraints

The fix for a long-standing USB-audio bug required one more dependency
variable to be added to the hw constraints.  Unfortunately I didn't
realize at debugging that the new addition may result in the overflow
of the dependency array of each snd_pcm_hw_rule (up to three plus a
sentinel), because USB-audio driver adds one more dependency only for
a certain device and bus, hence it works as is for many devices.  But
in a bad case, a simple open always results in -EINVAL (with kernel
WARNING if CONFIG_SND_DEBUG is set) no matter what is passed.

Since the dependencies are real and unavoidable (USB-audio restricts
the hw_params per looping over the format/rate/channels combos), the
only good solution seems to raise the bar for one more dependency for
snd_pcm_hw_rule -- so does this patch: now the hw constraint
dependencies can be up to four.
