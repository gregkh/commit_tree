octeontx2-pf: Add support for ethtool ntuple filters

This patch adds support for adding and deleting ethtool ntuple
filters. The filters for ether, ipv4, ipv6, tcp, udp and sctp
are supported. The mask is also supported. The supported actions
are drop and direct to a queue. Additionally we support FLOW_EXT
field vlan_tci and FLOW_MAC_EXT.

The NIX PF will allocate total 32 MCAM entries for the use of
ethtool ntuple filters. The Administrative Function(AF) will
install/delete the MCAM rules when NIX PF sends mailbox message
to install/delete the ntuple filters.

Ethtool ntuple filters support is restricted to PFs as of now
and PF can install ntuple filters to direct the traffic to its
VFs. Hence added a separate callback for VFs to get/set RSS
configuration.
