net: mscc: ocelot: install MAC addresses in .ndo_set_rx_mode from process context

Currently ocelot_set_rx_mode calls ocelot_mact_learn directly, which has
a very nice ocelot_mact_wait_for_completion at the end. Introduced in
commit 639c1b2625af ("net: mscc: ocelot: Register poll timeout should be
wall time not attempts"), this function uses readx_poll_timeout which
triggers a lot of lockdep warnings and is also dangerous to use from
atomic context, potentially leading to lockups and panics.

Steen Hegelund added a poll timeout of 100 ms for checking the MAC
table, a duration which is clearly absurd to poll in atomic context.
So we need to defer the MAC table access to process context, which we do
via a dynamically allocated workqueue which contains all there is to
know about the MAC table operation it has to do.
