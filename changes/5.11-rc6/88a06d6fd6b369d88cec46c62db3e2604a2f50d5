ALSA: rawmidi: Access runtime->avail always in spinlock

The runtime->avail field may be accessed concurrently while some
places refer to it without taking the runtime->lock spinlock, as
detected by KCSAN.  Usually this isn't a big problem, but for
consistency and safety, we should take the spinlock at each place
referencing this field.
