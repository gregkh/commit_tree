fbdev: sbuslib: remove unused FBIOSCURSOR32 helper

No driver implements FBIOSCURSOR, so this function has no purpose
and can be removed. Apparently it was added in linux-2.1.44 to handle
compatibility for drivers/sbus/char/sunfb.c but lost its purpose when
that driver got rewritten in linux-2.5.63.
