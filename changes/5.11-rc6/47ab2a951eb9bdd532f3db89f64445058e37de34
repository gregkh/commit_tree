orinoco: Remove ezusb_doicmd_wait()

ezusb_doicmd_wait() is invoked via ->init_cmd_wait() callback.
This callback is only invoked hermesi_program_init() and
hermesi_program_end() which are the ->program_init() and ->program_end()
callbacks as assigned by `hermes_ops_local'. They are never used by the
USB interface since the USB interface provides its own set of callbacks
by `ezusb_ops'.

Replace ezusb_doicmd_wait() with a warning in case I missed the obvious.
