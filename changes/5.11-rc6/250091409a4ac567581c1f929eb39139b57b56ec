KVM: SVM: Unconditionally sync GPRs to GHCB on VMRUN of SEV-ES guest

Drop the per-GPR dirty checks when synchronizing GPRs to the GHCB, the
GRPs' dirty bits are set from time zero and never cleared, i.e. will
always be seen as dirty.  The obvious alternative would be to clear
the dirty bits when appropriate, but removing the dirty checks is
desirable as it allows reverting GPR dirty+available tracking, which
adds overhead to all flavors of x86 VMs.

Note, unconditionally writing the GPRs in the GHCB is tacitly allowed
by the GHCB spec, which allows the hypervisor (or guest) to provide
unnecessary info; it's the guest's responsibility to consume only what
it needs (the hypervisor is untrusted after all).

  The guest and hypervisor can supply additional state if desired but
  must not rely on that additional state being provided.
