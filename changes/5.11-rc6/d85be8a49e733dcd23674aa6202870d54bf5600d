powerpc: Fix incorrect stw{, ux, u, x} instructions in __set_pte_at

The placeholder for instruction selection should use the second
argument's operand, which is %1, not %0. This could generate incorrect
assembly code if the memory addressing of operand %0 is a different
form from that of operand %1.

Also remove the %Un placeholder because having %Un placeholders
for two operands which are based on the same local var (ptep) doesn't
make much sense. By the way, it doesn't change the current behaviour
because "<>" constraint is missing for the associated "=m".
