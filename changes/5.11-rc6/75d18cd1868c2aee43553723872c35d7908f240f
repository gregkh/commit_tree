ext4: prevent creating duplicate encrypted filenames

As described in "fscrypt: add fscrypt_is_nokey_name()", it's possible to
create a duplicate filename in an encrypted directory by creating a file
concurrently with adding the directory's encryption key.

Fix this bug on ext4 by rejecting no-key dentries in ext4_add_entry().

Note that the duplicate check in ext4_find_dest_de() sometimes prevented
this bug.  However in many cases it didn't, since ext4_find_dest_de()
doesn't examine every dentry.
