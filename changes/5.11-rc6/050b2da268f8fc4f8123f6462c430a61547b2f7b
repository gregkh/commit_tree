arc: use FLATMEM with freeing of unused memory map instead of DISCONTIGMEM

Currently ARC uses DISCONTIGMEM to cope with sparse physical memory address
space on systems with 2 memory banks. While DISCONTIGMEM avoids wasting
memory on unpopulated memory map, it adds both memory and CPU overhead
relatively to FLATMEM. Moreover, DISCONTINGMEM is generally considered
deprecated.

The obvious replacement for DISCONTIGMEM would be SPARSEMEM, but it is also
less efficient than FLATMEM in pfn_to_page() and page_to_pfn() conversions.
Besides it requires tuning of SECTION_SIZE which is not trivial for
possible ARC memory configuration.

Since the memory map for both banks is always allocated from the "lowmem"
bank, it is possible to use FLATMEM for two-bank configuration and simply
free the unused hole in the memory map. All is required for that is to
provide ARC-specific pfn_valid() that will take into account actual
physical memory configuration and define HAVE_ARCH_PFN_VALID.

The resulting kernel image configured with defconfig + HIGHMEM=y is
smaller:

  $ size a/vmlinux b/vmlinux
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  4673503 1245456  279756 6198715  5e95bb a/vmlinux
  4658706 1246864  279756 6185326  5e616e b/vmlinux

  $ ./scripts/bloat-o-meter a/vmlinux b/vmlinux
  add/remove: 28/30 grow/shrink: 42/399 up/down: 10986/-29025 (-18039)
  ...
  Total: Before=4709315, After = 4691276, chg -0.38%

Booting nSIM with haps_ns.dts results in the following memory usage
reports:

  a:
  Memory: 1559104K/1572864K available (3531K kernel code, 595K rwdata, 752K rodata, 136K init, 275K bss, 13760K reserved, 0K cma-reserved, 1048576K highmem)

  b:
  Memory: 1559112K/1572864K available (3519K kernel code, 594K rwdata, 752K rodata, 136K init, 280K bss, 13752K reserved, 0K cma-reserved, 1048576K highmem)
