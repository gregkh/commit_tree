ACPI/IORT: Do not blindly trust DMA masks from firmware

Address issue observed on real world system with suboptimal IORT table
where DMA masks of PCI devices would get set to 0 as result.

iort_dma_setup() would query the root complex'/named component IORT
entry for a DMA mask, and use that over the one the device has been
configured with earlier.

Ideally we want to use the minimum mask of what the IORT contains for
the root complex and what the device was configured with.
