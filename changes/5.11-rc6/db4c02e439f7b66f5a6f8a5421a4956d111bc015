drm/panel: s6e63m0: Set up some display info

Copy over the width/height in millimeters to the
(somewhat redundant) display info, and set up the
bus format and bus flags for the display.

When used as DPI this display requires DE to be
active low and pixel data to be output on the
negative edge. It might be that it was previously
used with a display controller that either does
not support these settings or was hardcoded to use
these as default. This information comes from the
source code of the Samsung GT-I9070 mobile phone.
