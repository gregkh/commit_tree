highmem: Make DEBUG_HIGHMEM functional

For some obscure reason when CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM is enabled the stack
depth is increased from 20 to 41. But the only thing DEBUG_HIGHMEM does is
to enable a few BUG_ON()'s in the mapping code.

That's a leftover from the historical mapping code which had fixed entries
for various purposes. DEBUG_HIGHMEM inserted guard mappings between the map
types. But that got all ditched when kmap_atomic() switched to a stack
based map management. Though the WITH_KM_FENCE magic survived without being
functional. All the thing does today is to increase the stack depth.

Add a working implementation to the generic kmap_local* implementation.
