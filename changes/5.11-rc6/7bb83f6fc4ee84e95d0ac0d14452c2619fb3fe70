tracing/kprobes: Do the notrace functions check without kprobes on ftrace

Enable the notrace function check on the architecture which doesn't
support kprobes on ftrace but support dynamic ftrace. This notrace
function check is not only for the kprobes on ftrace but also
sw-breakpoint based kprobes.
Thus there is no reason to limit this check for the arch which
supports kprobes on ftrace.

This also changes the dependency of Kconfig. Because kprobe event
uses the function tracer's address list for identifying notrace
function, if the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=n, it can not check whether
the target function is notrace or not.
