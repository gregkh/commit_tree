Revert "block: Fix a lockdep complaint triggered by request queue flushing"

This reverts commit b3c6a59975415bde29cfd76ff1ab008edbf614a9.

Now we can avoid nvme-loop lockdep warning of 'lockdep possible recursive locking'
by nvme-loop's lock class, no need to apply dynamically allocated lock class key,
so revert commit b3c6a5997541("block: Fix a lockdep complaint triggered by request
queue flushing").

This way fixes horrible SCSI probe delay issue on megaraid_sas, and it is reported
the whole probe may take more than half an hour.
