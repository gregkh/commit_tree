arm64: dts: hisilicon: list all clocks required by pl011.yaml

The arm,pl011 binding need to specify two clocks: "uartclk", "apb_pclk".
But only "apb_pclk" is specified now. Because the driver preferentially
matches the first clock. Otherwise, it matches the second clock instead
of both clocks. So both of them use the same clock don't change the
function.
