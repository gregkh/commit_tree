sctp: support for sending packet over udp6 sock

This one basically does the similar things in sctp_v6_xmit as does for
udp4 sock in the last patch, just note that:

  1. label needs to be calculated, as it's the param of
     udp_tunnel6_xmit_skb().

  2. The 'nocheck' param of udp_tunnel6_xmit_skb() is false, as
     required by RFC.

v1->v2:
  - Use sp->udp_port instead in sctp_v6_xmit(), which is more safe.
