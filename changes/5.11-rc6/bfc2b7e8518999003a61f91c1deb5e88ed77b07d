f2fs: prevent creating duplicate encrypted filenames

As described in "fscrypt: add fscrypt_is_nokey_name()", it's possible to
create a duplicate filename in an encrypted directory by creating a file
concurrently with adding the directory's encryption key.

Fix this bug on f2fs by rejecting no-key dentries in f2fs_add_link().

Note that the weird check for the current task in f2fs_do_add_link()
seems to make this bug difficult to reproduce on f2fs.
