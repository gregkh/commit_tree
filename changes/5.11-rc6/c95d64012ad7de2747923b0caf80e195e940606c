Revert "driver core: Avoid deferred probe due to fw_devlink_pause/resume()"

This reverts commit 2451e746478a6a6e981cfa66b62b791ca93b90c8.

fw_devlink_pause/resume() was an incomplete attempt at boot time
optimization. That's going to get replaced by a much better optimization
at the end of the series. Since fw_devlink_pause/resume() is going away,
changes made for that can also go away.
