usb: typec: tcpm: Update vbus_vsafe0v on init

During init, vbus_vsafe0v does not get updated till the first
connect as a sink. This causes TCPM to be stuck in SRC_ATTACH_WAIT
state while booting with a sink (For instance: a headset) connected.

[    1.429168] Start toggling
[    1.439907] CC1: 0 -> 0, CC2: 0 -> 0 [state TOGGLING, polarity 0, disconnected]
[    1.445242] CC1: 0 -> 0, CC2: 0 -> 0 [state TOGGLING, polarity 0, disconnected]
[   53.358528] CC1: 0 -> 0, CC2: 0 -> 2 [state TOGGLING, polarity 0, connected]
[   53.358564] state change TOGGLING -> SRC_ATTACH_WAIT [rev1 NONE_AMS]

Fix this by updating vbus_vsafe0v based on vbus_present status
on boot.
