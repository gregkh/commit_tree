ice: update dev_addr in ice_set_mac_address even if HW filter exists

Fix the driver to copy the MAC address configured in ndo_set_mac_address
into dev_addr, even if the MAC filter already exists in HW. In some
situations (e.g. bonding) the netdev's dev_addr could have been modified
outside of the driver, with no change to the HW filter, so the driver
cannot assume that they match.
