file: Factor files_lookup_fd_locked out of fcheck_files

To make it easy to tell where files->file_lock protection is being
used when looking up a file create files_lookup_fd_locked.  Only allow
this function to be called with the file_lock held.

Update the callers of fcheck and fcheck_files that are called with the
files->file_lock held to call files_lookup_fd_locked instead.

Hopefully this makes it easier to quickly understand what is going on.

The need for better names became apparent in the last round of
discussion of this set of changes[1].
