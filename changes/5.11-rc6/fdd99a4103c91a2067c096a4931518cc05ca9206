arm64/mm/hotplug: Ensure early memory sections are all online

This adds a validation function that scans the entire boot memory and makes
sure that all early memory sections are online. This check is essential for
the memory notifier to work properly, as it cannot prevent any boot memory
from offlining, if all sections are not online to begin with. Although the
boot section scanning is selectively enabled with DEBUG_VM.
