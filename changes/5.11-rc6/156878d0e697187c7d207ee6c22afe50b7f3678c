net/mlx5e: Disable hw-tc-offload when MLX5_CLS_ACT config is disabled

The cited commit introduce new CONFIG_MLX5_CLS_ACT kconfig variable
to control compilation of TC hardware offloads implementation.
When this configuration is disabled the driver is still wrongly
reports in ethtool that hw-tc-offload is supported.

Fixed by reporting hw-tc-offload is supported only when
CONFIG_MLX5_CLS_ACT is enabled.
