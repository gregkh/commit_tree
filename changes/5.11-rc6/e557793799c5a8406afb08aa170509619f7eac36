RISC-V: Fix maximum allowed phsyical memory for RV32

Linux kernel can only map 1GB of address space for RV32 as the page offset
is set to 0xC0000000. The current description in the Kconfig is confusing
as it indicates that RV32 can support 2GB of physical memory. That is
simply not true for current kernel. In future, a 2GB split support can be
added to allow 2GB physical address space.
