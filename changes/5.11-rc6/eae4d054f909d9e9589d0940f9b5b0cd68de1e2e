ALSA: usb-audio: Annotate the endpoint index in audioformat

There are devices that have multiple endpoints sharing the same
iface/altset not only for sync but also for the actual streams, and
the audioformat for such an endpoint needs to be handled with the
proper endpoint index; otherwise it confuses the endpoint management.

This patch extends the audioformat to annotate the endpoint index, and
put the proper ep_idx=1 to Pioneer device quirk entries accordingly.
