perf evlist: Fix id index for heterogeneous systems

perf_evlist__set_sid_idx() updates perf_sample_id with the evlist map
index, CPU number and TID. It is passed indexes to the evsel's cpu and
thread maps, but references the evlist's maps instead. That results in
using incorrect CPU numbers on heterogeneous systems. Fix it by using
evsel maps.

The id index (PERF_RECORD_ID_INDEX) is used by AUX area tracing when in
sampling mode. Having an incorrect CPU number causes the trace data to
be attributed to the wrong CPU, and can result in decoder errors because
the trace data is then associated with the wrong process.

Committer notes:

Keep the class prefix convention in the function name, switching from
perf_evlist__set_sid_idx() to perf_evsel__set_sid_idx().
