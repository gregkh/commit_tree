arm64: Ignore any DMA offsets in the max_zone_phys() calculation

Currently, the kernel assumes that if RAM starts above 32-bit (or
zone_bits), there is still a ZONE_DMA/DMA32 at the bottom of the RAM and
such constrained devices have a hardwired DMA offset. In practice, we
haven't noticed any such hardware so let's assume that we can expand
ZONE_DMA32 to the available memory if no RAM below 4GB. Similarly,
ZONE_DMA is expanded to the 4GB limit if no RAM addressable by
zone_bits.
