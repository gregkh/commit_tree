pwm: Remove unused function pwmchip_add_inversed()

This is only defined with CONFIG_PWM unset and was introduced together
with pwmchip_add_with_polarity() (which is only defined with CONFIG_PWM
enabled). I guess the series that introduced pwmchip_add_with_polarity()
had a different concept in earlier revisions and the !CONFIG_PWM part
was just not updated accordingly.

Given that there is no implementation for pwmchip_add_with_polarity()
without CONFIG_PWM, just drop pwmchip_add_inversed() instead of renaming
it to pwmchip_add_with_polarity().
