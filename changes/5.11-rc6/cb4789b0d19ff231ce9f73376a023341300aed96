iommu/ioasid: Add ioasid references

Let IOASID users take references to existing ioasids with ioasid_get().
ioasid_put() drops a reference and only frees the ioasid when its
reference number is zero. It returns true if the ioasid was freed.
For drivers that don't call ioasid_get(), ioasid_put() is the same as
ioasid_free().
