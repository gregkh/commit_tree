ASoC: mediatek: mt6359: Fix regulator_dev_lookup() fails for id "LDO_VAUD18"

Mt6359 platform device is instantiated by mfd_add_devices(). In the
case, dev->of_node is NULL so that always fails to get the regulator_dev.

Use regualator-name "vaud18" that in dts node instead of
"LDO_VAUD19-supply". So that we can get regulator_dev through
regulator_lookup_by_name() directly.
