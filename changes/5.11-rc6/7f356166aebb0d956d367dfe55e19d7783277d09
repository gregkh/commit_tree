nfp: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having a
dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use "flexible array members"[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].
