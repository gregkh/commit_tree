USB: serial: keyspan_pda: fix dropped unthrottle interrupts

Commit c528fcb116e6 ("USB: serial: keyspan_pda: fix receive sanity
checks") broke write-unthrottle handling by dropping well-formed
unthrottle-interrupt packets which are precisely two bytes long. This
could lead to blocked writers not being woken up when buffer space again
becomes available.

Instead, stop unconditionally printing the third byte which is
(presumably) only valid on modem-line changes.
