xfrm: Fix wraparound in xfrm_policy_addr_delta()

Use three-way comparison for address components to avoid integer
wraparound in the result of xfrm_policy_addr_delta(). This ensures
that the search trees are built and traversed correctly.

Treat IPv4 and IPv6 similarly by returning 0 when prefixlen == 0.
Prefix /0 has only one equivalence class.
