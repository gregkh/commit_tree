scsi: ufs: Adjust logic in common ADAPT helper

The introduction of ufshcd_dme_configure_adapt() refactored out duplication
from the Mediatek and Qualcomm drivers.

Both these implementations had the logic of:

    gear_tx == UFS_HS_G4 => PA_INITIAL_ADAPT
    gear_tx != UFS_HS_G4 => PA_NO_ADAPT

but now both implementations pass PA_INITIAL_ADAPT as "adapt_val" and if
gear_tx is not UFS_HS_G4 that is replaced with PA_INITIAL_ADAPT. In other
words, it's PA_INITIAL_ADAPT in both above cases.

The result is that e.g. Qualcomm SM8150 has no longer functional UFS, so
adjust the logic to match the previous implementation.
