nvme-fcloop: add sysfs attribute to inject command drop

Add sysfs attribute to specify parameters for dropping a command.  The
attribute takes a string of:

  <opcode>:<starting a what instance>:<number of times>

Opcode is formatted as lower 8 bits are opcode.  If a fabrics opcode, a
bit above bits 7:0 will be set.

Once set, each sqe is looked at. If the opcode matches the running
instance count is updated. If the instance count is in the range of where
to drop (based on starting and # of times), then drop the command by not
passing it to the target layer.
