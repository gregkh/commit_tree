clk: at91: clk-master: re-factor master clock

Re-factor master clock driver by splitting it into 2 clocks: prescaller
and divider clocks. Based on registered clock flags the prescaler's rate
could be changed at runtime. This is necessary for platforms supporting
DVFS (e.g. SAMA7G5) where master clock could be changed at run-time.
