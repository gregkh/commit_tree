powerpc/64s: Remove "Host" from MCE logging

"Host" caused machine check is printed when the kernel sees a MCE
hit in this kernel or userspace, and "Guest" if it hit one of its
guests. This is confusing when a guest kernel handles a hypervisor-
delivered MCE, it also prints "Host".

Just remove "Host". "Guest" is adequate to make the distinction.
