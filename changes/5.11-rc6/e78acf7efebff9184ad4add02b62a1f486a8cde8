thermal: intel_pch_thermal: Add PCI ids for Lewisburg PCH.

I noticed that I couldn't read the PCH temperature on my workstation
(C620 series chipset, w/ 2x Xeon Gold 5215 CPUs) directly, but had to go
through IPMI. Looking at the data sheet, it looks to me like the
existing intel PCH thermal driver should work without changes for
Lewisburg.

I suspect there's some other PCI IDs missing. But I hope somebody at
Intel would have an easier time figuring that out than I...
