media: omap3isp: Remove misleading comment

in_interrupt() covers hard and soft interrupt servicing and bottom half
disabled contexts, which is semantically undefined and useless.

The comment for __ccdc_lsc_configure() "Context: in_interrupt()" is
therefore as useful as "Context: unknown'. Remove it.
