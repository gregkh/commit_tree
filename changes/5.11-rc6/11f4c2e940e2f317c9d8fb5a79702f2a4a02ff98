riscv: Fix kernel time_init()

If of_clk_init() is not called in time_init(), clock providers defined
in the system device tree are not initialized, resulting in failures for
other devices to initialize due to missing clocks.
Similarly to other architectures and to the default kernel time_init()
implementation, call of_clk_init() before executing timer_probe() in
time_init().
