powerpc/perf: Drop the check for SIAR_VALID

In power10 DD1, there is an issue that causes the SIAR_VALID bit of
the SIER (Sampled Instruction Event Register) to not be set. But the
SIAR_VALID bit is used for fetching the instruction address from the
SIAR (Sampled Instruction Address Register), and marked events are
sampled only if the SIAR_VALID bit is set. So drop the check for
SIAR_VALID and return true always incase of power10 DD1.
