iio: adc: ad7887: convert probe to device-managed functions

This is conversion of the driver to use device-managed functions.
The IIO registration and triggered buffer setup both have device-managed
versions.
The regulator disable needs to be handled via an action_or_reset handler.

With these changes, the remove hook is removed, and the error path is
cleaned up in probe.
