iwlwifi: mvm: guard against device removal in reprobe

If we get into a problem severe enough to attempt a reprobe,
we schedule a worker to do that. However, if the problem gets
more severe and the device is actually destroyed before this
worker has a chance to run, we use a free device. Bump up the
reference count of the device until the worker runs to avoid
this situation.
