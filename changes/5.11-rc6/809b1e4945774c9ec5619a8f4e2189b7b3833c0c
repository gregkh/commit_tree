dm: avoid filesystem lookup in dm_get_dev_t()

This reverts commit
644bda6f3460 ("dm table: fall back to getting device using name_to_dev_t()")

dm_get_dev_t() is just used to convert an arbitrary 'path' string
into a dev_t. It doesn't presume that the device is present; that
check will be done later, as the only caller is dm_get_device(),
which does a dm_get_table_device() later on, which will properly
open the device.

So if the path string already _is_ in major:minor representation
we can convert it directly, avoiding a recursion into the filesystem
to lookup the block device.

This avoids a hang in multipath_message() when the filesystem is
inaccessible.
