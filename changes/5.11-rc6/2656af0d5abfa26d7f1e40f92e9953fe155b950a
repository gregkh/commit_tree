x86/elf: Use e_machine to choose DLINFO in compat

Since TIF_X32 is going away, avoid using it to find the ELF type on
ARCH_DLINFO.

According to SysV AMD64 ABI Draft, an AMD64 ELF object using ILP32 must
have ELFCLASS32 with (E_MACHINE == EM_X86_64), so use that ELF field to
differentiate a x32 object from a IA32 object when loading ARCH_DLINFO in
compat mode.
