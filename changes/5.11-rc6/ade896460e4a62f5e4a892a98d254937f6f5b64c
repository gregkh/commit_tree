drm: DRM_KMB_DISPLAY should depend on ARCH_KEEMBAY

The Intel Keem Bay display controller is only present on Intel Keem Bay
SoCs.  Hence add a dependency on ARCH_KEEMBAY, to prevent asking the
user about this driver when configuring a kernel without Intel Keem Bay
platform support.

Note that:
  1. The dependency on ARM is dropped, as Keem Bay SoCs are only
     supported in arm64 kernel builds,
  2. The dependencies on OF and COMMON_CLK can be dropped for
     compile-testing, as the driver builds fine regardless.
