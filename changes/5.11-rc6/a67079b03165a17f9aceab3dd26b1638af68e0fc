selftests/bpf: fix bpf_testmod.ko recompilation logic

bpf_testmod.ko build rule declared dependency on VMLINUX_BTF, but the variable
itself was initialized after the rule was declared, which often caused
bpf_testmod.ko to not be re-compiled. Fix by moving VMLINUX_BTF determination
sooner.

Also enforce bpf_testmod.ko recompilation when we detect that vmlinux image
changed by removing bpf_testmod/bpf_testmod.ko. This is necessary to generate
correct module's split BTF. Without it, Kbuild's module build logic might
determine that nothing changed on the kernel side and thus bpf_testmod.ko
shouldn't be rebuilt, so won't re-generate module BTF, which often leads to
module's BTF with wrong string offsets against vmlinux BTF. Removing .ko file
forces Kbuild to re-build the module.
