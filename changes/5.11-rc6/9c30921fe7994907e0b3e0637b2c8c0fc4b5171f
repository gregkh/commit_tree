driver core: platform: use bus_type functions

This works towards the goal mentioned in 2006 in commit 594c8281f905
("[PATCH] Add bus_type probe, remove, shutdown methods.").

The functions are moved to where the other bus_type functions are
defined and renamed to match the already established naming scheme.
