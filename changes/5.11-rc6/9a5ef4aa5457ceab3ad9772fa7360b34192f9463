net: hns3: add support for 1280 queues

For DEVICE_VERSION_V1/2, there are total 1024 queues and
queue sets. For DEVICE_VERSION_V3, it increases to 1280,
and can be assigned to one pfï¼Œ so remove the limitation
of 1024.

To keep compatible with DEVICE_VERSION_V1/2 and old driver
version, the queue number is split into two part:
tqp_num(range 0~1023) and ext_tqp_num(range 1024~1279).
