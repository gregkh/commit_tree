drm/amdgpu: add per device user friendly xgmi events for vega20

Non-outbound data metrics are non useful so mark them as legacy.
Bucket new perf counters into device and not device ip.
Bind events to chip instead of IP.
Report available event counters and not number of hw counter banks.
Move DF public macros to private since not needed outside of IP version.

v5: cleanup by moving per chip configs into structs

v4: After more discussion, replace *_LEGACY references with IP references
to indicate concept of pmu-typed versus event-config-typed event
registration.

v3: attr groups const array is global but attr groups are allocated per
device which doesn't work and causes problems on memory allocation and
de-allocation for pmu unregister. Switch to building const attr groups
per pmu instead to simplify solution.

v2: add comments on sysfs structure and formatting.
