scripts: get_feat.pl: use its implementation for list-arch.sh

Add support for the same output format as the bash script,
and use its implementation instead of the previous one.

I opted to do such patch in order to have a single script
responsible for parsing Documentation/features and
produce different outputs.

As someone may rely on the past format, which is easy
to parse it, get_feat.pl now gains a new command with
the same output format as the previous script.

As a side effect, the perl script is a lot faster, as it reads
each file only once, instead of parsing files several times
via a for command and grep commands inside it.

This patch also changes the features list order to be
case-insensitive, in order to better match the output of
the existing script.
