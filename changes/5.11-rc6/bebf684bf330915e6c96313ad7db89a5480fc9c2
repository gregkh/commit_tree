file: Rename __fcheck_files to files_lookup_fd_raw

The function fcheck despite it's comment is poorly named
as it has no callers that only check it's return value.
All of fcheck's callers use the returned file descriptor.
The same is true for fcheck_files and __fcheck_files.

A new less confusing name is needed.  In addition the names
of these functions are confusing as they do not report
the kind of locks that are needed to be held when these
functions are called making error prone to use them.

To remedy this I am making the base functio name lookup_fd
and will and prefixes and sufficies to indicate the rest
of the context.

Name the function (previously called __fcheck_files) that proceeds
from a struct files_struct, looks up the struct file of a file
descriptor, and requires it's callers to verify all of the appropriate
locks are held files_lookup_fd_raw.

The need for better names became apparent in the last round of
discussion of this set of changes[1].
