s390/udelay: make it work for the early code

Currently udelay relies on working EXT interrupts handler, which is not
the case during early startup. In such cases udelay_simple() has to be
used instead.

To avoid mistakes of calling udelay too early, which could happen from
the common code as well - make udelay work for the early code by
introducing static branch and redirecting all udelay calls to
udelay_simple until EXT interrupts handler is fully initialized and
async stack is allocated.
