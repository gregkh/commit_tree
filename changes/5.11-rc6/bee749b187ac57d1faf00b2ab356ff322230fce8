io_uring: fix files cancellation

io_uring_cancel_files()'s task check condition mistakenly got flipped.

1. There can't be a request in the inflight list without
IO_WQ_WORK_FILES, kill this check to keep the whole condition simpler.
2. Also, don't call the function for files==NULL to not do such a check,
all that staff is already handled well by its counter part,
__io_uring_cancel_task_requests().

With that just flip the task check.

Also, it iowq-cancels all request of current task there, don't forget to
set right ->files into struct io_task_cancel.

Fixes: c1973b38bf639 ("io_uring: cancel only requests of current task")
