mm: fix page_owner initializing issue for arm32

Page owner of pages used by page owner itself used is missing on arm32
targets.  The reason is dummy_handle and failure_handle is not initialized
correctly.  Buddy allocator is used to initialize these two handles.
However, buddy allocator is not ready when page owner calls it.  This
change fixed that by initializing page owner after buddy initialization.

The working flow before and after this change are:
original logic:
 1. allocated memory for page_ext(using memblock).
 2. invoke the init callback of page_ext_ops like page_owner(using buddy
    allocator).
 3. initialize buddy.

after this change:
 1. allocated memory for page_ext(using memblock).
 2. initialize buddy.
 3. invoke the init callback of page_ext_ops like page_owner(using buddy
    allocator).

with the change, failure/dummy_handle can get its correct value and page
owner output for example has the one for page owner itself:

  Page allocated via order 2, mask 0x6202c0(GFP_USER|__GFP_NOWARN), pid 1006, ts 67278156558 ns
  PFN 543776 type Unmovable Block 531 type Unmovable Flags 0x0()
    init_page_owner+0x28/0x2f8
    invoke_init_callbacks_flatmem+0x24/0x34
    start_kernel+0x33c/0x5d8
