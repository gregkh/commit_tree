net: ethernet: ti: cpts: fix ethtool output when no ptp_clock registered

The CPTS driver registers PTP PHC clock when first netif is going up and
unregister it when all netif are down. Now ethtool will show:
 - PTP PHC clock index 0 after boot until first netif is up;
 - the last assigned PTP PHC clock index even if PTP PHC clock is not
registered any more after all netifs are down.

This patch ensures that -1 is returned by ethtool when PTP PHC clock is not
registered any more.
