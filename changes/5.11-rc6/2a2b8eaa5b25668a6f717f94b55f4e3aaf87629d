iommu: Handle freelists when using deferred flushing in iommu drivers

Allow the iommu_unmap_fast to return newly freed page table pages and
pass the freelist to queue_iova in the dma-iommu ops path.

This is useful for iommu drivers (in this case the intel iommu driver)
which need to wait for the ioTLB to be flushed before newly
free/unmapped page table pages can be freed. This way we can still batch
ioTLB free operations and handle the freelists.
