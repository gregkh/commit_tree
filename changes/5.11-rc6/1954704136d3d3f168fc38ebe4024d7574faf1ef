net: ipa: use Qtime for IPA v4.5 aggregation time limit

Change aggr_time_limit_encoded() to properly calculate the
aggregation time limit to use for IPA v4.5.

Older IPA versions program the AGGR_GRANULARITY field of the
of the COUNTER_CFG register to set the granularity of the
aggregation timer, which we configure to be 500 microseconds.

Instead, IPA v4.5 selects between two possible granularity values
derived from the 19.2 MHz Qtime clock.  These granularities are
100 microseconds or 1 millisecond per tick.  We use the smaller
granularity if possible, unless the desired period is too large
to be specified that way.
