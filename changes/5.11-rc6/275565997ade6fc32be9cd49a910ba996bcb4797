ASoC: AMD Renoir - add DMI entry for Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 2

The ThinkPad E14 Gen 2 latop does not have the internal digital
microphone connected to the AMD's ACP bridge, but it's advertised
via BIOS. The internal microphone is connected to the HDA codec.

Use DMI to block the microphone PCM device for this platform.
