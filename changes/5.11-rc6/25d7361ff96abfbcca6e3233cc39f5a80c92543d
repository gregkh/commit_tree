dt-bindings: display: bridge: Add documentation for LT9611UXC

Lontium LT9611UXC is a DSI to HDMI bridge which supports 2 DSI ports
and I2S port as input and one HDMI port as output. The LT9611UXC chip is
handled by a separate driver, but the bindings used are fully compatible
with the LT9611 chip, so let's reuse the lt9611.yaml schema.
