drm/virtio: implement blob resources: fix stride discrepancy

The old transfer ioctls may work on blob resources, and there is no
TRANSFER_BLOB hypercall now for simplicity.

The guest may have a image view on the blob resources such that the
stride is not equal to width * bytes_per_pixel.

For host-only blobs, we can repurpose the transfer ioctls to synchronize
caches as well.  For guest-only blobs, these operations are undefined
for now so leave them out.

Also, with seamless Wayland integration between guest/host looking
increasingly attractive, it also makes sense to keep track of
one value for stride.
