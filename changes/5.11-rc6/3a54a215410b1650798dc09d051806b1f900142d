Input: st1232 - add support resolution reading

Hard-coding resolution for st1633 device was wrong. Some of LCDs like
YTS700TLBC-02-100C has assembled Sitronix st1633 touchcontroller too. But
the resolution is not 320x480 as was hard-coded.
Add new function which reads correct resolution directly from register.
