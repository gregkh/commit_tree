drm/ingenic: ipu: Search for scaling coefs up to 102% of the screen

Increase the scaled image's theorical width/height until we find a
configuration that has valid scaling coefficients, up to 102% of the
screen's resolution. This makes sure that we can scale from almost
every resolution possible at the cost of a very small distorsion.
The CRTC_W / CRTC_H are not modified.

This algorithm was already in place but would not try to go above the
screen's resolution, and as a result would only work if the CRTC_W /
CRTC_H were smaller than the screen resolution. It will now try until it
reaches 102% of the screen's resolution.

Note that this algorithm exists mostly as a band-aid for a missing
functionality: it is not possible for userspace to request the closest
mode that would encapsulate the provided one, because the GEM buffer is
created beforehand. If there was a way to let the kernel tweak the mode,
I could write a better algorithm that would result in a better looking
picture.
