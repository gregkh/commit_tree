iio:pressure:mpl3115: Force alignment of buffer

Whilst this is another case of the issue Lars reported with
an array of elements of smaller than 8 bytes being passed
to iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp(), the solution here is
a bit different from the other cases and relies on __aligned
working on the stack (true since 4.6?)

This one is unusual.  We have to do an explicit memset() each time
as we are reading 3 bytes into a potential 4 byte channel which
may sometimes be a 2 byte channel depending on what is enabled.
As such, moving the buffer to the heap in the iio_priv structure
doesn't save us much.  We can't use a nice explicit structure
on the stack either as the data channels have different storage
sizes and are all separately controlled.
