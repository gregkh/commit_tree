iwlwifi: fix the NMI flow for old devices

I noticed that the flow that triggers an NMI on the firmware
for old devices (tested on 7265) doesn't work.
Apparently, the firmware / device is still in low power when
we write the register that triggers the NMI. We call the
"grab_nic_access" function to make sure the device is awake
but that wasn't enough. I played with this and noticed that
if we wait 1 ms after the device reports it is awake before
we write to the NMI register, the device always sees our
write and the firmware gets properly asserted.

Triggering an NMI to the firmware can be done with the
debugfs hook:
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/iwlwifi/0000\:00\:03.0/iwlmvm/fw_nmi

What happened before is that the firmware would just stall
without running its NMI routine. Because of that the driver
wouldn't get the "firmware crashed" interrupt. After a while
the driver would notice that the firmware is not responding
to some command and it would read the error data from the
firmware, but this data is populated in the NMI service
routine in the firmware which was not called. So in the logs
it looked like:

iwlwifi 0000:00:03.0: Error sending REPLY_ERROR: time out after 2000ms.

...

With this fix, immediately after we trigger the NMI to the
firmware, we get the expected:

Notice the first line: "Microcode SW error detected:" which
is printed in the driver's ISR, which means that the driver
actually got an interrupt from the firmware saying that it
crashed. And then we have the properly populated error data.
