seqlock: avoid -Wshadow warnings

When building with W=2, there is a flood of warnings about the seqlock
macros shadowing local variables:

  19806 linux/seqlock.h:331:11: warning: declaration of 'seq' shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
     48 linux/seqlock.h:348:11: warning: declaration of 'seq' shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
      8 linux/seqlock.h:379:11: warning: declaration of 'seq' shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]

Prefix the local variables to make the warning useful elsewhere again.
