virtio-gpu api: host visible feature

This patch adds a new virtgpu feature that allows directly
mapping host allocated resources.

This is based on virtio shared memory regions, which allows
querying for memory regions using PCI transport. Each shared
memory region has an associated "shmid", the meaning of which
is device specific.

For virtio-gpu, we can define the shared memory region with id
VIRTIO_GPU_SHM_ID_HOST_VISIBLE to be the "host visible memory
region".

The presence of the host visible memory region means the following
hypercalls are supported:

1) VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_MAP_BLOB

This hypercall tells the host to inject the host resource's
mapping in an offset into virtio-gpu's PCI address space.
This is typically done via KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION on Linux
hosts.

On success, VIRTIO_GPU_RESP_OK_MAP_INFO is returned, which
specifies the host buffer's caching type and possibly in the
future performance hints about the buffer..

2) VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_UNMAP_BLOB

This hypercall tells the host to remove the host resource's
mapping from the guest VM.
