rtw88: fix multiple definition of rtw_pm_ops

'const struct dev_pm_ops rtw_pm_ops' is declared by pci.c, and it should be
declare as 'extern' in pci.h. Without 'extern' causes every file including
pci.h has an individual instance of rtw_pm_ops but not reference to the one
declared in pci.c

If kernel config, like test robot, doesn't build driver as module, it leads
multiple definition.
