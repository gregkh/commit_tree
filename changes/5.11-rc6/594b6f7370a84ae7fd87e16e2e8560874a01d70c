drm/amd/display: Fix kernel panic by dal_gpio_open() error

Currently both error code paths handled in dal_gpio_open_ex() issues
ASSERT_CRITICAL(), and this leads to a kernel panic unnecessarily if
CONFIG_KGDB is enabled.  Since basically both are non-critical errors
and can be recovered, drop those assert calls and use a safer one,
BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER(), for allowing the debugging, instead.
