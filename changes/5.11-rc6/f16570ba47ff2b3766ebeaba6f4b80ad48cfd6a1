KVM: arm64: arch_timer: Remove VGIC initialization check

kvm_timer_enable() is called in kvm_vcpu_first_run_init() after
kvm_vgic_map_resources() if the VGIC wasn't ready. kvm_vgic_map_resources()
is the only place where kvm->arch.vgic.ready is set to true.

For a v2 VGIC, kvm_vgic_map_resources() will attempt to initialize the VGIC
and set the initialized flag.

For a v3 VGIC, kvm_vgic_map_resources() will return an error code if the
VGIC isn't already initialized.

The end result is that if we've reached kvm_timer_enable(), the VGIC is
initialzed and ready and vgic_initialized() will always be true, so remove
this check.
