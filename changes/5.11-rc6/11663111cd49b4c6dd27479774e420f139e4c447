KVM: arm64: Hide PMU registers from userspace when not available

It appears that while we are now able to properly hide PMU
registers from the guest when a PMU isn't available (either
because none has been configured, the host doesn't have
the PMU support compiled in, or that the HW doesn't have
one at all), we are still exposing more than we should to
userspace.

Introduce a visibility callback gating all the PMU registers,
which covers both usrespace and guest.
