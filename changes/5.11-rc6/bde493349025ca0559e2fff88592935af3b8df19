fs-verity: move structs needed for file signing to UAPI header

Although it isn't used directly by the ioctls,
"struct fsverity_descriptor" is required by userspace programs that need
to compute fs-verity file digests in a standalone way.  Therefore
it's also needed to sign files in a standalone way.

Similarly, "struct fsverity_formatted_digest" (previously called
"struct fsverity_signed_digest" which was misleading) is also needed to
sign files if the built-in signature verification is being used.

Therefore, move these structs to the UAPI header.

While doing this, try to make it clear that the signature-related fields
in fsverity_descriptor aren't used in the file digest computation.
