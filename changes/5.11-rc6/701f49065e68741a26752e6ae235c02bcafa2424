arm64: mark __system_matches_cap as __maybe_unused

Now that the PAN toggling has been removed, the only user of
__system_matches_cap() is has_generic_auth(), which is only built when
CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH is selected, and Qian reports that this results in
a build-time warning when CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH is not selected:

| arch/arm64/kernel/cpufeature.c:2649:13: warning: '__system_matches_cap' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
|  static bool __system_matches_cap(unsigned int n)
|              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's tricky to restructure things to prevent this, so let's mark
__system_matches_cap() as __maybe_unused, as we used to do for the other
user of __system_matches_cap() which we just removed.
