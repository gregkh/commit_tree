net: dsa: microchip: Adjust reset release timing to match reference reset circuit

KSZ8794CNX datasheet section 8.0 RESET CIRCUIT describes recommended
circuit for interfacing with CPU/FPGA reset consisting of 10k pullup
resistor and 10uF capacitor to ground. This circuit takes ~100 ms to
rise enough to release the reset.

For maximum supply voltage VDDIO=3.3V VIH=2.0V R=10kR C=10uF that is
                    VDDIO - VIH
  t = R * C * -ln( ------------- ) = 10000*0.00001*-(-0.93)=0.093 s
                       VDDIO
so we need ~95 ms for the reset to really de-assert, and then the
original 100us for the switch itself to come out of reset. Simply
msleep() for 100 ms which fits the constraint with a bit of extra
space.
