entry: Unbreak single step reporting behaviour

The move of TIF_SYSCALL_EMU to SYSCALL_WORK_SYSCALL_EMU broke single step
reporting. The original code reported the single step when TIF_SINGLESTEP
was set and TIF_SYSCALL_EMU was not set. The SYSCALL_WORK conversion got
the logic wrong and now the reporting only happens when both bits are set.

Restore the original behaviour.

[ tglx: Massaged changelog and dropped the pointless double negation ]
