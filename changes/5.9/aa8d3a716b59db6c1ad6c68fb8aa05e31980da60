bpf, xdp: Add bpf_link-based XDP attachment API

Add bpf_link-based API (bpf_xdp_link) to attach BPF XDP program through
BPF_LINK_CREATE command.

bpf_xdp_link is mutually exclusive with direct BPF program attachment,
previous BPF program should be detached prior to attempting to create a new
bpf_xdp_link attachment (for a given XDP mode). Once BPF link is attached, it
can't be replaced by other BPF program attachment or link attachment. It will
be detached only when the last BPF link FD is closed.

bpf_xdp_link will be auto-detached when net_device is shutdown, similarly to
how other BPF links behave (cgroup, flow_dissector). At that point bpf_link
will become defunct, but won't be destroyed until last FD is closed.
