IB/mad: Issue complete whenever decrements agent refcount

Replace calls of atomic_dec() to mad_agent_priv->refcount with calls to
deref_mad_agent() in order to issue complete. Most likely the refcount is
> 1 at these points, but it is difficult to prove. Performance is not
important on these paths, so be obviously correct.
