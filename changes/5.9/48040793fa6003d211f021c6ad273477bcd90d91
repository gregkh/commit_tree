tcp: add earliest departure time to SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS

This change adds TCP_NLA_EDT to SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS that reports
the earliest departure time(EDT) of the timestamped skb. By tracking EDT
values of the skb from different timestamps, we can observe when and how
much the value changed. This allows to measure the precise delay
injected on the sender host e.g. by a bpf-base throttler.
