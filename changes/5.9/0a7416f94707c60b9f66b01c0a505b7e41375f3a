regulator: core: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in regulator_unlock_recursive()

The recent commit 7d8196641ee1 ("regulator: Remove pointer table
overallocation") changed the size of coupled_rdevs and now KASAN is able
to detect slab-out-of-bounds problem in regulator_unlock_recursive(),
which is a legit problem caused by a typo in the code. The recursive
unlock function uses n_coupled value of a parent regulator for unlocking
supply regulator, while supply's n_coupled should be used. In practice
problem may only affect platforms that use coupled regulators.
