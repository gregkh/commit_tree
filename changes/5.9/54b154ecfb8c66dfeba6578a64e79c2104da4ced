net/mlx5e: CT: Map 128 bits labels to 32 bit map ID

The 128 bits ct_label field is matched using a 32 bit hardware register.
As such, only the lower 32 bits of ct_label field are offloaded. Change
this logic to support setting and matching higher bits too.
Map the 128 bits data to a unique 32 bits ID. Matching is done as exact
match of the mapping ID of key & mask.
