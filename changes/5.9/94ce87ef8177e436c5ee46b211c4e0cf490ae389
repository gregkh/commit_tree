KVM: x86/mmu: Prepend "kvm_" to memory cache helpers that will be global

Rename the memory helpers that will soon be moved to common code and be
made globaly available via linux/kvm_host.h.  "mmu" alone is not a
sufficient namespace for globally available KVM symbols.

Opportunistically add "nr_" in mmu_memory_cache_free_objects() to make
it clear the function returns the number of free objects, as opposed to
freeing existing objects.
