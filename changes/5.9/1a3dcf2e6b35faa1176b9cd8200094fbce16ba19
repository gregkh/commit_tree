checkpatch: add test for repeated words

Try to avoid adding repeated words either on the same line or consecutive
comment lines in a block

e.g.:

duplicated word in comment block

	/*
	 * this is a comment block where the last word of the previous
	 * previous line is also the first word of the next line
	 */

and simple duplication

	/* test this this again */
