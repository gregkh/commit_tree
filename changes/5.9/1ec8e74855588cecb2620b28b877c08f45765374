net/fsl: quieten expected MDIO access failures

MDIO reads can happen during PHY probing, and printing an error with
dev_err can result in a large number of error messages during device
probe.  On a platform with a serial console this can result in
excessively long boot times in a way that looks like an infinite loop
when multiple busses are present.  Since 0f183fd151c (net/fsl: enable
extended scanning in xgmac_mdio) we perform more scanning so there are
potentially more failures.

Reduce the logging level to dev_dbg which is consistent with the
Freescale enetc driver.
