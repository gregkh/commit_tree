staging: kpc2000: kpc_dma: Remove additional goto statements

As 3 goto level referring to same common code, those can be
accomodated with a single goto level and renameing it to
unpin_pages. Set the -ERRNO when returning partial mapped
pages in more appropriate place.

When dma_map_sg() failed, the previously allocated memory was
not freed properly. This is corrected now.
