mm/memory.c: make remap_pfn_range() reject unaligned addr

This function implicitly assumes that the addr passed in is page aligned.
A non page aligned addr could ultimately cause a kernel bug in
remap_pte_range as the exit condition in the logic loop may never be
satisfied.  This patch documents the need for the requirement, as well as
explicitly adds a check for it.
