usb: ohci-omap: Convert to use GPIO descriptors

The OMAP1 OHCI driver is using the legacy GPIO API to grab some
random GPIO lines. One is from the TPS65010 chip and used for
power, another one is for overcurrent and while the driver picks
this line it doesn't watch it at all.

Convert the driver and the OMAP1 OSK board file to pass these
two GPIOs as machine described GPIO descriptors.

I noticed the overcurrent GPIO line is not really used in the
code so dropped in a little comment for other developers.
