drm/amd/display: Blank stream before destroying HDCP session

[Why]
Stream disable sequence incorretly destroys HDCP session while stream is
not blanked and while audio is not muted. This sequence causes a flash
of corruption during mode change and an audio click.

[How]
Change sequence to blank stream before destroying HDCP session. Audio will
also be muted by blanking the stream.
