drm/amd/display: not reset dmub in driver.

[Why]
during S0i3, set power state is toggled a few times,
and dmub uC will restart with current reset/hw_init.

[How]
Remove reset in set power state, and before doing hw_init,
check if dmub is enabled, and doing FW autoload check only
if dmub is already enabled.
