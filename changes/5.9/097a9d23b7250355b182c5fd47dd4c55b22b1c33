RDMA/bnxt_re: Remove the qp from list only if the qp destroy succeeds

Driver crashes when destroy_qp is re-tried because of an error
returned. This is because the qp entry was removed from the qp list during
the first call.

Remove qp from the list only if destroy_qp returns success.

The driver will still trigger a WARN_ON due to the memory leaking, but at
least it isn't corrupting memory too.
