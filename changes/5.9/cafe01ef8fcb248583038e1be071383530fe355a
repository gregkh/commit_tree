block: release disk reference in hd_struct_free_work

Commit e8c7d14ac6c3 ("block: revert back to synchronous request_queue removal")
stops to release request queue from wq context because that commit
supposed all blk_put_queue() is called in context which is allowed
to sleep. However, this assumption isn't true because we release disk's
reference in partition's percpu_ref's ->release() which doesn't allow
to sleep, because the ->release() is run via call_rcu().

Fixes this issue by moving put disk reference into hd_struct_free_work()
