gpio/aspeed-sgpio: don't enable all interrupts by default

Currently, the IRQ setup for the SGPIO driver enables all interrupts in
dual-edge trigger mode. Since the default handler is handle_bad_irq, any
state change on input GPIOs will trigger bad IRQ warnings.

This change applies sensible IRQ defaults: single-edge trigger, and all
IRQs disabled.
