i2c: meson: keep peripheral clock enabled

SCL rate appears to be different than what is expected. For example,
We get 164kHz on i2c3 of the vim3 when 400kHz is expected. This is
partially due to the peripheral clock being disabled when the clock is
set.

Let's keep the peripheral clock on after probe to fix the problem. This
does not affect the SCL output which is still gated when i2c is idle.
