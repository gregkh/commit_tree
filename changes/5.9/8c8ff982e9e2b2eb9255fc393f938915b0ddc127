ASoC: tegra: Add Tegra210 based DMIC driver

The Digital MIC (DMIC) Controller is used to interface with Pulse Density
Modulation (PDM) input devices. The DMIC controller implements a converter
to convert PDM signals to Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) signals. From signal
flow perspective, the DMIC can be viewed as a PDM receiver.

This patch registers DMIC component with ASoC framework. The component
driver exposes DAPM widgets, routes and kcontrols for the device. The DAI
driver exposes DMIC interfaces, which can be used to connect different
components in the ASoC layer. Makefile and Kconfig support is added to
allow to build the driver. The DMIC devices can be enabled in the DT via
"nvidia,tegra210-dmic" compatible string. This driver can be used for
Tegra186 and Tegra194 chips as well.
