i2c: npcm7xx: Clear LAST bit after a failed transaction.

Due to a HW issue, in some scenarios the LAST bit might remain set.
This will cause an unexpected NACK after reading 16 bytes on the next
read.

Example: if user tries to read from a missing device, get a NACK,
then if the next command is a long read ( > 16 bytes),
the master will stop reading after 16 bytes.
To solve this, if a command fails, check if LAST bit is still
set. If it does, reset the module.
