io_uring: partially inline io_iopoll_getevents()

io_iopoll_reap_events() doesn't care about returned valued of
io_iopoll_getevents() and does the same checks for list emptiness
and need_resched(). Just use io_do_iopoll().

io_sq_thread() doesn't check return value as well. It also passes min=0,
so there never be the second iteration inside io_poll_getevents().
Inline it there too.
