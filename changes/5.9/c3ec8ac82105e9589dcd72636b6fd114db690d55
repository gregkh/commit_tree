ASoC: hdac_hda: fix memleak on module unload

The hdac_hda remove implementation fails to free the hda codec
resources, leading to memleaks at module unload. This gap has been there
from the start, commit 6bae5ea94989 ("ASoC: hdac_hda: add asoc
extension for legacy HDA codec drivers").

Instead of duplicating the cleanup logic, use the common
snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() to free the resources. Remove
existing code in hdac_hda to cleanup "codec.jackpoll_work" and call to
snd_hdac_regmap_exit(), as these are already done in
snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind().

The cleanup is done in ASoC component remove() callback and not in the
HDAC bus hdev_detach(). This is done to ensure the codec specific
cleanup routines are run before the parent card is freed.
