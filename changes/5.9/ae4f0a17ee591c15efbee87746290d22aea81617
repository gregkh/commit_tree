swiotlb-xen: remove start_dma_addr

It is not strictly needed. Call virt_to_phys on xen_io_tlb_start
instead. It will be useful not to have a start_dma_addr around with the
next patches.

Note that virt_to_phys is not the same as xen_virt_to_bus but actually
it is used to compared again __pa(xen_io_tlb_start) as passed to
swiotlb_init_with_tbl, so virt_to_phys is actually what we want.
