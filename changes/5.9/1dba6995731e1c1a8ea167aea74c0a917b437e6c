net: phy: reset the PHY even if probe() is not implemented

Currently we only call phy_device_reset() if the PHY driver implements
the probe() callback. This is not mandatory and many drivers (e.g.
realtek) don't need probe() for most devices but still can have reset
GPIOs defined. There's no reason to depend on the presence of probe()
here so pull the reset code out of the if clause.
