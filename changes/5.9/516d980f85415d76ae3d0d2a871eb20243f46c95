scripts/kallsyms: skip ppc compiler stub *.long_branch.* / *.plt_branch.*

PowerPC allmodconfig often fails to build as follows:

    LD      .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms1
    KSYM    .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms1.o
    LD      .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2
    KSYM    .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2.o
    LD      .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms3
    KSYM    .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms3.o
    LD      vmlinux
    SORTTAB vmlinux
    SYSMAP  System.map
  Inconsistent kallsyms data
  Try make KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=1 as a workaround
  make[2]: *** [../Makefile:1162: vmlinux] Error 1

Setting KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=1 does not help.

This is caused by the compiler inserting stubs such as *.long_branch.*
and *.plt_branch.*

  $ powerpc-linux-nm -n .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2
   [ snip ]
  c00000000210c010 t 00000075.plt_branch.da9:19
  c00000000210c020 t 00000075.plt_branch.1677:5
  c00000000210c030 t 00000075.long_branch.memmove
  c00000000210c034 t 00000075.plt_branch.9e0:5
  c00000000210c044 t 00000075.plt_branch.free_initrd_mem
    ...

Actually, the problem mentioned in scripts/link-vmlinux.sh comments;
"In theory it's possible this results in even more stubs, but unlikely"
is happening here, and ends up with another kallsyms step required.

scripts/kallsyms.c already ignores various compiler stubs. Let's do
similar to make kallsysms for PowerPC always succeed in 2 steps.
