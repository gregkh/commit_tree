vdpa/mlx5: Fix dependency on MLX5_CORE

Remove propmt for selecting MLX5_VDPA by the user and modify
MLX5_VDPA_NET to select MLX5_VDPA. Also modify MLX5_VDPA_NET to depend
on mlx5_core.

This fixes an issue where configuration sets 'y' for MLX5_VDPA_NET while
MLX5_CORE is compiled as a module causing link errors.
