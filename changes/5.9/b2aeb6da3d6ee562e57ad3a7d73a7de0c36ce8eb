usb: cdns3: drd: simplify *switch_gadet and *switch_host

Patch split function cdns3_drd_switch_gadget and
cdns3_drd_switch_host into:
- cdns3_drd_host_on
- cdns3_drd_host_off
- cdns3_drd_gadget_on
- cdns3_drd_gadgett_off

These functions don't have any shared code so it's better to
have smaller, faster and easier functions.
