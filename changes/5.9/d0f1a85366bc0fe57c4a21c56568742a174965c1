drm/amdkfd: Support newer assemblers in gfx10 trap handler

The contents of macros are parsed by the assembler before conditions
have been tested. This causes assembly errors when using IP-specific
instructions in the IP-unified trap handler.

Add a preprocessing step to filter IP-specific code.

Also guard a Navi1x-specific instruction (no effect on Sienna_Cichlid).
