ice: Allow 2 queue pairs per VF on SR-IOV initialization

Currently VFs are only allowed to get 16, 4, and 1 queue pair by
default, which require 17, 5, and 2 MSI-X vectors respectively. This
is because each VF needs a MSI-X per data queue and a MSI-X for its
other interrupt. The calculation is based on the number of VFs created,
MSI-X available, and queue pairs available at the time of VF creation.

Unfortunately the values above exclude 2 queue pairs when only 3 MSI-X
are available to each VF based on resource constraints. The current
calculation would default to 2 MSI-X and 1 queue pair. This is a waste
of resources, so fix this by allowing 2 queue pairs per VF when there
are between 2 and 5 MSI-X available per VF.
