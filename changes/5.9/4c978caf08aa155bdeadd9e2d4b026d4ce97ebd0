drm/msm/dpu: Fix scale params in plane validation

Plane validation uses an API drm_calc_scale which will
return src/dst value as a scale ratio.

when viewing the range on a scale the values should fall in as

Upscale ratio < Unity scale < Downscale ratio for src/dst formula

Fix the min and max scale ratios to suit the API accordingly.
