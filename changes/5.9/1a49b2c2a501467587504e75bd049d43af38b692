mptcp: Handle incoming 32-bit DATA_FIN values

The peer may send a DATA_FIN mapping with either a 32-bit or 64-bit
sequence number. When a 32-bit sequence number is received for the
DATA_FIN, it must be expanded to 64 bits before comparing it to the
last acked sequence number. This expansion was missing.
