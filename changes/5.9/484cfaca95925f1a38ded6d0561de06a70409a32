mm, slub: restore initial kmem_cache flags

The routine that applies debug flags to the kmem_cache slabs
inadvertantly prevents non-debug flags from being applied to those
same objects.  That is, if slub_debug=<flag>,<slab> is specified,
non-debugged slabs will end up having flags of zero, and the slabs
may be unusable.

Fix this by including the input flags for non-matching slabs with the
contents of slub_debug, so that the caches are created as expected
alongside any debugging options that may be requested.  With this, we
can remove the check for a NULL slub_debug_string, since it's covered
by the loop itself.
