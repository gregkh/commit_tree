octeontx2-af: Fix enable/disable of default NPC entries

Packet replication feature present in Octeontx2
is a hardware linked list of PF and its VF
interfaces so that broadcast packets are sent
to all interfaces present in the list. It is
driver job to add and delete a PF/VF interface
to/from the list when the interface is brought
up and down. This patch fixes the
npc_enadis_default_entries function to handle
broadcast replication properly if packet replication
feature is present.
