fanotify: use struct fanotify_info to parcel the variable size buffer

An fanotify event name is always recorded relative to a dir fh.
Encapsulate the name_len member of fanotify_name_event in a new struct
fanotify_info, which describes the parceling of the variable size
buffer of an fanotify_name_event.

The dir_fh member of fanotify_name_event is renamed to _dir_fh and is not
accessed directly, but via the fanotify_info_dir_fh() accessor.
Although the dir_fh len information is already available in struct
fanotify_fh, we store it also in dif_fh_totlen member of fanotify_info,
including the size of fanotify_fh header, so we know the offset of the
name in the buffer without looking inside the dir_fh.

We also add a file_fh_totlen member to allow packing another file handle
in the variable size buffer after the dir_fh and before the name.
We are going to use that space to store the child fid.
