selftests/bpf: Make test_varlen work with 32-bit user-space arch

Despite bpftool generating data section memory layout that will work for
32-bit architectures on user-space side, BPF programs should be careful to not
use ambiguous types like `long`, which have different size in 32-bit and
64-bit environments. Fix that in test by using __u64 explicitly, which is
a recommended approach anyway.
