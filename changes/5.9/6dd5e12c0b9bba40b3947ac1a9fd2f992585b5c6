arm64: dts: rockchip: rename and label gpio-led subnodes part 2

Current dts files with 'gpio-led' nodes were manually verified.
In order to automate this process leds-gpio.txt
has been converted to yaml. With this conversion a check
for pattern properties was added. In part 2 rename and label
gpio-led subnodes that passed the regex, but still don't have
the preferred form. Any pin subnode that ends with '-gpio'
in the pinctrl node generates a warning.

Fix with help of the following rules:

1: Add nodename in the preferred form.

2: Always add a label that ends with '_led' to prevent conflicts
   with other labels such as 'power' and 'mmc'

3: If leds need pinctrl add a label that ends with '_led_pin'
   also to prevent conflicts with other labels.

patternProperties:
  # The first form is preferred, but fall back to just 'led'
  # anywhere in the node name to at least catch some child nodes.
  "(^led-[0-9a-f]$|led)":
