platform/x86: mlx-platform: Fix extended topology configuration for power supply units

Fix topology configuration for power supply units in structure
'mlxplat_mlxcpld_ext_pwr_items_data', due to hardware change.

Note: no need to backport the fix, since there is no such hardware yet
(equipped with four power) at the filed.
