spi: spi-geni-qcom: No need for irqsave variant of spinlock calls

The driver locks its locks in two places.

In the first usage of the lock the function doing the locking already
has a sleeping call and thus we know we can't be called from interrupt
context.  That means we can use the "spin_lock_irq" variant of the
function.

In the second usage of the lock the function is the interrupt handler
and we know interrupt handlers are called with interrupts disabled.
That means we can use the "spin_lock" variant of the function.

This patch is expected to be a no-op and is just a cleanup / slight
optimization.
