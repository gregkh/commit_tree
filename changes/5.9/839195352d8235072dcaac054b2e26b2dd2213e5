mm/shuffle: remove dynamic reconfiguration

Commit e900a918b098 ("mm: shuffle initial free memory to improve
memory-side-cache utilization") promised "autodetection of a
memory-side-cache (to be added in a follow-on patch)" over a year ago.

The original series included patches [1], however, they were dropped
during review [2] to be followed-up later.

Due to lack of platforms that publish an HMAT, autodetection is currently
not implemented.  However, manual activation is actively used [3].  Let's
simplify for now and re-add when really (ever?) needed.
