cpuidle: Drop misleading comments about RCU usage

The commit 1098582a0f6c ("sched,idle,rcu: Push rcu_idle deeper into the
idle path"), moved the calls rcu_idle_enter|exit() into the cpuidle core.

However, it forgot to remove a couple of comments in enter_s2idle_proper()
about why RCU_NONIDLE earlier was needed. So, let's drop them as they have
become a bit misleading.
