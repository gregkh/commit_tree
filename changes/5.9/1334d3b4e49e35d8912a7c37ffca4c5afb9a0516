i2c: meson: fixup rate calculation with filter delay

Apparently, 15 cycles of the peripheral clock are used by the controller
for sampling and filtering. Because this was not known before, the rate
calculation is slightly off.

Clean up and fix the calculation taking this filtering delay into account.
