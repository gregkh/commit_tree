sparc: share process creation helpers between sparc and sparc64

As promised in the previous patch, this moves the process creation
helpers into a common process.c file that is shared between sparc and
sparc64. It allows us to get rid of quite a bit custom assembler and the
to remove the separe 32bit specific sparc_do_fork() call.

One thing to note, is that when clone() was called with a separate stack
for the child the assembler would align it. But copy_thread() has always
been doing that too so that line wasn't needed and can thus simply be
removed.
