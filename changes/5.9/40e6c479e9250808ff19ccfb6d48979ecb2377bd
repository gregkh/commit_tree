mmc: sdio: Fix 1-bit mode for SD-combo cards during suspend

Commit 6b5eda369ac3 ("sdio: put active devices into 1-bit mode during
suspend") disabled 4-bit mode during system suspend. After this patch,
commit 7310ece86ad7 ("mmc: implement SD-combo (IO+mem) support") used
new sdio_enable_4bit_bus() instead of sdio_enable_wide() to support
SD-combo cards, also for card resume. However, no corresponding support
added during suspend. That is not correct. Let's fix it.
