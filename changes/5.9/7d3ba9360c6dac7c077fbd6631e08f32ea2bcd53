net: phy: call phy_disable_interrupts() in phy_attach_direct() instead

Since the micrel phy driver calls phy_init_hw() as a workaround,
the commit 9886a4dbd2aa ("net: phy: call phy_disable_interrupts()
in phy_init_hw()") disables the interrupt unexpectedly. So,
call phy_disable_interrupts() in phy_attach_direct() instead.
Otherwise, the phy cannot link up after the ethernet cable was
disconnected.

Note that other drivers (like at803x.c) also calls phy_init_hw().
So, perhaps, the driver caused a similar issue too.
