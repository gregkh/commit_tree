bpf: Prevent .BTF section elimination

Systems with memory or disk constraints often reduce the kernel footprint
by configuring LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION. However, this can result in
removal of any BTF information.

Use the KEEP() macro to preserve the BTF data as done with other important
sections, while still allowing for smaller kernels.
