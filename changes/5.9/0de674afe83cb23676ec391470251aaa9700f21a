arm64: stacktrace: Move export for save_stack_trace_tsk()

Due to refactoring way back in bb53c820c5b0f1 ("arm64: stacktrace: avoid
listing stacktrace functions in stacktrace") the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() for
save_stack_trace_tsk() is at the end of __save_stack_trace() rather than
the function it exports. Move it to the expected location.
