PCI: xilinx-nwl: Use pci_is_root_bus() to check if bus is root bus

Use pci_is_root_bus() rather than tracking the root bus number to
determine if the bus is the root bus or not. This removes storing
duplicated data as well as the need for the host bridge driver to have
to care about the bus numbers in most cases.

There was also a bug that the pci_host_bridge.busnr is set from
root_busno, but root_busno is never set which means the root bus number
is always 0 even if the DT said something else.
