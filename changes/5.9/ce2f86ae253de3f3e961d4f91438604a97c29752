l2tp: remove BUG_ON in l2tp_session_queue_purge

l2tp_session_queue_purge is only called from l2tp_core.c, and it's easy
to statically analyse the code paths calling it to validate that it
should never be passed a NULL session pointer.

Having a BUG_ON checking the session pointer triggers a checkpatch
warning.  Since the BUG_ON is of no value, remove it to avoid the
warning.
