block: relax jiffies rounding for timeouts

In doing high IOPS testing, blk-mq is generally pretty well optimized.
There are a few things that stuck out as using more CPU than what is
really warranted, and one thing is the round_jiffies_up() that we do
twice for each request. That accounts for about 0.8% of the CPU in
my testing.

We can make this cheaper by avoiding an integer division, by just adding
a rough HZ mask that we can AND with instead. The timeouts are only on a
second granularity already, we don't have to be that accurate here and
this patch barely changes that. All we care about is nice grouping.
