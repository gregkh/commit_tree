selftests/livepatch: refine dmesg 'taints' in dmesg comparison

The livepatch selftests currently grep on "taints" to filter out
"tainting kernel with TAINT_LIVEPATCH" messages which may be logged when
loading livepatch modules.

Further filter the log to drop "loading out-of-tree module taints
kernel" in the rare case the klp_test modules have been built
out-of-tree.

Look for the longer "taints kernel" or "tainting kernel" strings to
avoid inadvertent partial matching.
