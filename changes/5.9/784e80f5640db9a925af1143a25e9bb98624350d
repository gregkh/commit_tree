xfs: use a per-resource struct for incore dquot data

Introduce a new struct xfs_dquot_res that we'll use to track all the
incore data for a particular resource type (block, inode, rt block).
This will help us (once we've eliminated q_core) to declutter quota
functions that currently open-code field access or pass around fields
around explicitly.
