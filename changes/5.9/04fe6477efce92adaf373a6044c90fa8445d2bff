arm64: dts: k3-j721e-proc-board: Add wait time for sampling Type-C DIR line

The Type-C compainon chip on the board needs ~133ms (tCCB_DEFAULT)
to debounce the CC lines in order to detect attach and plug orientation
and reflect the correct DIR status. [1]

On the EVM however we need to wait upto 700ms before sampling the
Type-C DIR line else we can get incorrect direction state.
