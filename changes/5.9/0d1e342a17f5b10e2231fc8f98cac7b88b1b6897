media: mtk-mdp: Remove states for format checks

The mtk-mdp driver uses states to check if the formats have been set
on the capture and output when turning the streaming on, setting
controls or setting the selection rectangles.
Those states are reset when 0 buffers are requested like when checking
capabilities.
This patch removes all format checks and set one by default as queues in
V4L2 are expected to always have a format set.
