futex: Remove unused or redundant includes

Since 82af7aca ("Removal of FUTEX_FD"), some includes related to file
operations aren't needed anymore. More investigation around the includes
showed that a lot of includes aren't required for compilation, possible
due to redundant includes. Simplify the code by removing unused
includes.
