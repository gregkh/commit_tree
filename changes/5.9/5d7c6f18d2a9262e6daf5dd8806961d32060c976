drm/amdkfd: Update hardware scheduling time quanta

Update PROCESS_QUANTUM, the time the hardware scheduler allows
processes to run before switching to other processes when it becomes
over-subscribed. Increase this to 10ms, to allow processes to better
amortize their task switch times.

Update HQD Quantum, the amount of time that an active queue stays
attached to the CP before we forcibly switch it for another active
queue for fairness.

Setting these so that HQD < PROCESS makes it easier to ensure that
we get fairness when we have multiple active queues on the device.
Otherwise we may start process-swapping before we get to all the
queues in a CP.
