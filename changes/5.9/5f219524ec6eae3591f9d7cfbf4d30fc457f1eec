spi: spi-geni-qcom: Set the clock properly at runtime resume

In the patch ("spi: spi-geni-qcom: Avoid clock setting if not needed")
we avoid a whole pile of clock code.  As part of that, we should have
restored the clock at runtime resume.  Do that.

It turns out that, at least with today's configurations, this doesn't
actually matter.  That's because none of the current device trees have
an OPP table for geni SPI yet.  That makes dev_pm_opp_set_rate(dev, 0)
a no-op.  This is why it wasn't noticed in the testing of the original
patch.  It's still a good idea to fix, though.
