net: atlantic: enable ipv6 support for TCP LSO and UDP GSO

This patch enables ipv6 support for TCP LSO and UDP GSO.
The code itself (aq_nic_map_skb) was ready for this after udp gso feature,
but corresponding NETIF_F_TSO6 wasn't enabled.

We now have tested both tcp and udp v6 GSO, and enabling them safely.
