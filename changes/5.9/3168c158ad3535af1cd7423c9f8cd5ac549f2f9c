libbpf: Fix build failure from uninitialized variable warning

While compiling libbpf, some GCC versions (at least 8.4.0) have difficulty
determining control flow and a emit warning for potentially uninitialized
usage of 'map', which results in a build error if using "-Werror":

In file included from libbpf.c:56:
libbpf.c: In function '__bpf_object__open':
libbpf_internal.h:59:2: warning: 'map' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  libbpf_print(level, "libbpf: " fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__); \
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~
libbpf.c:5032:18: note: 'map' was declared here
  struct bpf_map *map, *targ_map;
                  ^~~

The warning/error is false based on code inspection, so silence it with a
NULL initialization.
