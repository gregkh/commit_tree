mac80211: remove the need for variable rates_idx

Currently rates_idx is being initialized with the value -1 and this
value is never read so the initialization is redundant and can be
removed. The next time the variable is used it is assigned a value
that is returned a few statements later. Just return i - 1 and
remove the need for rates_idx.
