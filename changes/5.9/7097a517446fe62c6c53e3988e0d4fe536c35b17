scsi: aic7xxx: Remove unused variable 'targ'

Looks like checking the 'targ' was removed in 2005.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c: In function ‘ahc_send_async’:
 drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:1604:28: warning: variable ‘targ’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 1604 | struct ahc_linux_target *targ;
 | ^~~~
