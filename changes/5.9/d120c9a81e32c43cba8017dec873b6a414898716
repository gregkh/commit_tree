via-rhine: Fix for the hardware having a reset failure after resume

In rhine_resume() and rhine_suspend(), the code calls netif_running()
to see if the network interface is down or not.  If it is down (i.e.,
netif_running() returning false), they will skip any housekeeping work
within the function relating to the hardware.  This becomes a problem
when the hardware resumes from a standby since it is counting on
rhine_resume() to map its MMIO and power up rest of the hardware.
Not getting its MMIO remapped and rest of the hardware powered
up lead to a soft reset failure and hardware disappearance.  The
solution is to map its MMIO and power up rest of the hardware inside
rhine_open() before soft reset is to be performed.  This solution was
verified on ASUS P5V800-VM mainboard's integrated Rhine-II Ethernet
MAC inside VIA Technologies VT8251 South Bridge.
