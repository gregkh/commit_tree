net: core: introduce struct netdev_nested_priv for nested interface infrastructure

Functions related to nested interface infrastructure such as
netdev_walk_all_{ upper | lower }_dev() pass both private functions
and "data" pointer to handle their own things.
At this point, the data pointer type is void *.
In order to make it easier to expand common variables and functions,
this new netdev_nested_priv structure is added.

In the following patch, a new member variable will be added into this
struct to fix the lockdep issue.
