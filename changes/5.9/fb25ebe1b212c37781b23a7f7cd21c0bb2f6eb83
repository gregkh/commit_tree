drbd: code cleanup by using sendpage_ok() to check page for kernel_sendpage()

In _drbd_send_page() a page is checked by following code before sending
it by kernel_sendpage(),
        (page_count(page) < 1) || PageSlab(page)
If the check is true, this page won't be send by kernel_sendpage() and
handled by sock_no_sendpage().

This kind of check is exactly what macro sendpage_ok() does, which is
introduced into include/linux/net.h to solve a similar send page issue
in nvme-tcp code.

This patch uses macro sendpage_ok() to replace the open coded checks to
page type and refcount in _drbd_send_page(), as a code cleanup.
