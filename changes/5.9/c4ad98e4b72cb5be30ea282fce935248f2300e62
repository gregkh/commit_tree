KVM: arm64: Assume write fault on S1PTW permission fault on instruction fetch

KVM currently assumes that an instruction abort can never be a write.
This is in general true, except when the abort is triggered by
a S1PTW on instruction fetch that tries to update the S1 page tables
(to set AF, for example).

This can happen if the page tables have been paged out and brought
back in without seeing a direct write to them (they are thus marked
read only), and the fault handling code will make the PT executable(!)
instead of writable. The guest gets stuck forever.

In these conditions, the permission fault must be considered as
a write so that the Stage-1 update can take place. This is essentially
the I-side equivalent of the problem fixed by 60e21a0ef54c ("arm64: KVM:
Take S1 walks into account when determining S2 write faults").

Update kvm_is_write_fault() to return true on IABT+S1PTW, and introduce
kvm_vcpu_trap_is_exec_fault() that only return true when no faulting
on a S1 fault. Additionally, kvm_vcpu_dabt_iss1tw() is renamed to
kvm_vcpu_abt_iss1tw(), as the above makes it plain that it isn't
specific to data abort.
