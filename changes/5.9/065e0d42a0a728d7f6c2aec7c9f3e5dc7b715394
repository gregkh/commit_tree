ethtool: Add support for 100Gbps per lane link modes

Define 100G, 200G and 400G link modes using 100Gbps per lane

LR, ER and FR are defined as a single link mode because they are
using same technology and by design are fully interoperable.
EEPROM content indicates if the module is LR, ER, or FR, and the
user space ethtool decoder is planned to support decoding these
modes in the EEPROM.
