ASoC: soc-core: Fix regression causing sysfs entries to disappear

The allocation order of things in soc_new_pcm_runtime was changed to
move the device_register before the allocation of the rtd structure.
This was to allow the rtd allocation to be managed by devm. However
currently the sysfs entries are added by device_register and their
visibility depends on variables within the rtd structure, this causes
the pmdown_time and dapm_widgets sysfs entries to be missing for all
rtds.

Correct this issue by manually calling device_add_groups after the
appropriate information is available.
