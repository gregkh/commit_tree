mac80211: improve AQL tx airtime estimation

AQL does not take into account that most HT/VHT/HE traffic is A-MPDU aggregated.
Because of that, the per-packet airtime overhead is vastly overestimated.
Improve it by assuming an average aggregation length of 16 for non-legacy
traffic if not using the VO AC queue.
This should improve performance with high data rates, especially with multiple
stations
