drivers/irqchip: Use new macro ACPI_DECLARE_SUBTABLE_PROBE_ENTRY

In an effort to enable -Wcast-function-type in the top-level Makefile to
support Control Flow Integrity builds, there are the need to remove all
the function callback casts.

To do this, modify the IRQCHIP_ACPI_DECLARE macro to use the new defined
macro ACPI_DECLARE_SUBTABLE_PROBE_ENTRY instead of the macro
ACPI_DECLARE_PROBE_ENTRY. This is necessary to be able to initialize the
the acpi_probe_entry struct using the probe_subtbl field instead of the
probe_table field and avoid function cast mismatches.

Also, modify the prototype of the functions used by the invocation of the
IRQCHIP_ACPI_DECLARE macro to match all the parameters.
