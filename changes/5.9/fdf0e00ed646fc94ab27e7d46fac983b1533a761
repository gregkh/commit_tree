remoteproc: Introducing function rproc_actuate()

Introduce function rproc_actuate() that provides the same
functionatlity as rproc_fw_boot(), but without the steps that
involve interaction with the firmware image.  That way we can
deal with scenarios where the remoteproc core is attaching
to a remote processor that has already been started by another
entity.
