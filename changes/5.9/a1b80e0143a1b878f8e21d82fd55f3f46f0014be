hinic: fix rewaking txq after netif_tx_disable

When calling hinic_close in hinic_set_channels, all queues are
stopped after netif_tx_disable, but some queue may be rewaken in
free_tx_poll by mistake while drv is handling tx irq. If one queue
is rewaken core may call hinic_xmit_frame to send pkt after
netif_tx_disable within a short time which may results in accessing
memory that has been already freed in hinic_close. So we call
napi_disable before netif_tx_disable in hinic_close to fix this bug.
