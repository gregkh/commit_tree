net/mlx5e: Fix missing switch_id for representors

Cited commit in fixes tag missed to set the switch id of the PF and VF
ports. Due to this flow cannot be offloaded, a simple command like below
fails to offload with below error.

tc filter add dev ens2f0np0 parent ffff: prio 1 flower \
 dst_mac 00:00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00:00 skip_sw \
 action mirred egress redirect dev ens2f0np0pf0vf0

Error: mlx5_core: devices are not on same switch HW, can't offload forwarding.

Hence, fix it by setting switch id for each PF and VF representors port
as before the cited commit.
