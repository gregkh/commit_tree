rkvdec: h264: Refuse to decode unsupported bitstream

The hardware only supports 4:2:2, 4:2:0 or 4:0:0 (monochrome),
8-bit or 10-bit depth content.

Verify that the SPS refers to a supported bitstream, and refuse
unsupported bitstreams by failing at TRY_EXT_CTRLS time.

The driver is currently broken on 10-bit and 4:2:2
so disallow those as well.
