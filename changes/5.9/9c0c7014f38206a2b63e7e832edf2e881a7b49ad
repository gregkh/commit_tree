net: dsa: Setup dsa_netdev_ops

Now that we have all the infrastructure in place for calling into the
dsa_ptr->netdev_ops function pointers, install them when we configure
the DSA CPU/management interface and tear them down. The flow is
unchanged from before, but now we preserve equality of tests when
network device drivers do tests like dev->netdev_ops == &foo_ops which
was not the case before since we were allocating an entirely new
structure.
