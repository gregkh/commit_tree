net: mscc: ocelot: warn when encoding an out-of-bounds watermark value

There is an upper bound to the value that a watermark may hold. That
upper bound is not immediately obvious during configuration, and it
might be possible to have accidental truncation.

Actually this has happened already, add a warning to prevent it from
happening again.
