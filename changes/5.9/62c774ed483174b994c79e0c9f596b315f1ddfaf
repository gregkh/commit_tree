io_uring: don't unconditionally set plug->nowait = true

This causes all the bios to be submitted with REQ_NOWAIT, which can be
problematic on either btrfs or on file systems that otherwise use a mix
of block devices where only some of them support it.

For now, just remove the setting of plug->nowait = true.
