r8169: improve setting WoL on runtime-resume

In the following scenario WoL isn't configured properly:
- Driver is loaded, interface isn't brought up within 10s, so driver
  runtime-suspends.
- WoL is set.
- Interface is brought up, stored WoL setting isn't applied.

It has always been like that, but the scenario seems to be quite
theoretical as I haven't seen any bug report yet. Therefore treat
the change as an improvement.
