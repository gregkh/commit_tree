recordmcount: Fix build failure on non arm64

Commit ea0eada45632 leads to the following build failure on powerpc:

  HOSTCC  scripts/recordmcount
scripts/recordmcount.c: In function 'arm64_is_fake_mcount':
scripts/recordmcount.c:440: error: 'R_AARCH64_CALL26' undeclared (first use in this function)
scripts/recordmcount.c:440: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
scripts/recordmcount.c:440: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [scripts/recordmcount] Error 1

Make sure R_AARCH64_CALL26 is always defined.

Fixes: ea0eada45632 ("recordmcount: only record relocation of type R_AARCH64_CALL26 on arm64.")
