drm/i915/gt: Restore both GGTT bindings on resume

We should be able to skip restoring LOCAL (user) binds within the GGTT on
resume and let them be restored upon demand. However, our consistency
checks demand that the bind flags match the node state, and we cannot
simply clear the flags, we need to evict as well. For now, make sure we
restore the bind flags exactly upon resume.
