btrfs: fix filesystem corruption after a device replace

We use a device's allocation state tree to track ranges in a device used
for allocated chunks, and we set ranges in this tree when allocating a new
chunk. However after a device replace operation, we were not setting the
allocated ranges in the new device's allocation state tree, so that tree
is empty after a device replace.

This means that a fitrim operation after a device replace will trim the
device ranges that have allocated chunks and extents, as we trim every
range for which there is not a range marked in the device's allocation
state tree. It is also important during chunk allocation, since the
device's allocation state is used to determine if a range is already
allocated when allocating a new chunk.

This is trivial to reproduce and the following script triggers the bug:

  $ cat reproducer.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV1="/dev/sdg"
  DEV2="/dev/sdh"
  DEV3="/dev/sdi"

  wipefs -a $DEV1 $DEV2 $DEV3 &> /dev/null

  # Create a raid1 test fs on 2 devices.
  mkfs.btrfs -f -m raid1 -d raid1 $DEV1 $DEV2 > /dev/null
  mount $DEV1 /mnt/btrfs

  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 10M" /mnt/btrfs/foo

  echo "Starting to replace $DEV1 with $DEV3"
  btrfs replace start -B $DEV1 $DEV3 /mnt/btrfs
  echo

  echo "Running fstrim"
  fstrim /mnt/btrfs
  echo

  echo "Unmounting filesystem"
  umount /mnt/btrfs

  echo "Mounting filesystem in degraded mode using $DEV3 only"
  wipefs -a $DEV1 $DEV2 &> /dev/null
  mount -o degraded $DEV3 /mnt/btrfs
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          dmesg | tail
          echo
          echo "Failed to mount in degraded mode"
          exit 1
  fi

  echo
  echo "File foo data (expected all bytes = 0xab):"
  od -A d -t x1 /mnt/btrfs/foo

  umount /mnt/btrfs

When running the reproducer:

  $ ./replace-test.sh
  wrote 10485760/10485760 bytes at offset 0
  10 MiB, 2560 ops; 0.0901 sec (110.877 MiB/sec and 28384.5216 ops/sec)
  Starting to replace /dev/sdg with /dev/sdi

  Failed to mount in degraded mode

So fix by setting all allocated ranges in the replace target device when
the replace operation is finishing, when we are holding the chunk mutex
and we can not race with new chunk allocations.

A test case for fstests follows soon.
