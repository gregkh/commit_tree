scsi: ufs-qcom: Name the dev_ref_clk_ctrl registers

In preparation for adding another optional register range to the ufs-qcom
driver, name the existing optional register range "dev_ref_clk_ctrl_mem".
This allows the driver to refer to the optional register ranges by name
rather than index.

No device-tree files actually have to be updated due to this change, since
none of them actually declares these registers.
