powerpc/64s/exception: treat NIA below __end_interrupts as soft-masked

The scv instruction causes an interrupt which can enter the kernel with
MSR[EE]=1, thus allowing interrupts to hit at any time. These must not
be taken as normal interrupts, because they come from MSR[PR]=0 context,
and yet the kernel stack is not yet set up and r13 is not set to the
PACA).

Treat this as a soft-masked interrupt regardless of the soft masked
state. This does not affect behaviour yet, because currently all
interrupts are taken with MSR[EE]=0.
