riscv: Fixup bootup failure with HARDENED_USERCOPY

6184358da000 ("riscv: Fixup static_obj() fail") attempted to elide a lockdep
failure by rearranging our kernel image to place all initdata within [_stext,
_end], thus triggering lockdep to treat these as static objects.  These objects
are released and eventually reallocated, causing check_kernel_text_object() to
trigger a BUG().

This backs out the change to make [_stext, _end] all-encompassing, instead just
moving initdata.  This results in initdata being outside of [__init_begin,
__init_end], which means initdata can't be freed.
