Fonts: Support FONT_EXTRA_WORDS macros for built-in fonts

syzbot has reported an issue in the framebuffer layer, where a malicious
user may overflow our built-in font data buffers.

In order to perform a reliable range check, subsystems need to know
`FONTDATAMAX` for each built-in font. Unfortunately, our font descriptor,
`struct console_font` does not contain `FONTDATAMAX`, and is part of the
UAPI, making it infeasible to modify it.

For user-provided fonts, the framebuffer layer resolves this issue by
reserving four extra words at the beginning of data buffers. Later,
whenever a function needs to access them, it simply uses the following
macros:

Recently we have gathered all the above macros to <linux/font.h>. Let us
do the same thing for built-in fonts, prepend four extra words (including
`FONTDATAMAX`) to their data buffers, so that subsystems can use these
macros for all fonts, no matter built-in or user-provided.

This patch depends on patch "fbdev, newport_con: Move FONT_EXTRA_WORDS
macros into linux/font.h".
