KVM: arm64: Handle data and instruction external aborts the same way

If the guest generates a synchronous external abort which is not handled
by the host, we inject it back into the guest as a virtual SError, but
only if the original fault was reported on the data side. Instruction
faults are reported as "Unsupported FSC", causing the vCPU run loop to
bail with -EFAULT.

Although synchronous external aborts from a guest are pretty unusual,
treat them the same regardless of whether they are taken as data or
instruction aborts by EL2.
