scripts/tags.sh: exclude tools directory from tags generation

when COMPILED_SOURCE is set, running 'make ARCH=x86_64 COMPILED_SOURCE=1
cscope tags' in KBUILD_OUTPUT directory produces lots of "No such file
or directory" warnings:
...
realpath: sigchain.h: No such file or directory
realpath: orc_gen.c: No such file or directory
realpath: objtool.c: No such file or directory
...
let's exclude tools directory from tags generation
