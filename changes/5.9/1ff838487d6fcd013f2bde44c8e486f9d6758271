dyndbg: drop obsolete comment on ddebug_proc_open

commit 4bad78c55002 ("lib/dynamic_debug.c: use seq_open_private() instead of seq_open()")'

The commit was one of a tree-wide set which replaced open-coded
boilerplate with a single tail-call.  It therefore obsoleted the
comment about that boilerplate, clean that up now.
