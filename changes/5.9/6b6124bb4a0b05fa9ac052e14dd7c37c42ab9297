drm/amdgpu: fix PSP autoload twice in FLR

Assigning false to block->status.hw overwrites PSP's previous
hardware status, which causes the PSP to Resume operation after
hardware init.

Remove this assignment and let the PSP execute Resume operation
when it is told to.

v2: Remove the braces.
v3: Modify the description.
