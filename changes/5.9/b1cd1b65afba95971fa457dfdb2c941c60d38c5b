USB: gadget: u_f: add overflow checks to VLA macros

size can potentially hold an overflowed value if its assigned expression
is left unchecked, leading to a smaller than needed allocation when
vla_group_size() is used by callers to allocate memory.
To fix this, add a test for saturation before declaring variables and an
overflow check to (n) * sizeof(type).
If the expression results in overflow, vla_group_size() will return SIZE_MAX.
