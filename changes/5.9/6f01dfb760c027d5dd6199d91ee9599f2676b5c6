media: cros-ec-cec: do not bail on device_init_wakeup failure

Do not fail probing when device_init_wakeup fails.

device_init_wakeup fails when the device is already enabled as wakeup
device. Hence, the driver fails to probe the device if:
- The device has already been enabled for wakeup (by e.g. sysfs)
- The driver has been unloaded and is being loaded again.

This goal of the patch is to fix the above cases.

Overwhelming majority of the drivers do not check device_init_wakeup
return code.
