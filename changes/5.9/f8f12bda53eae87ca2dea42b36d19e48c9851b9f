scsi: qla2xxx: Make __qla2x00_alloc_iocbs() initialize 32 bits of request_t.handle

The request_t 'handle' member is 32-bits wide, hence use wrt_reg_dword().
Change the cast in the wrt_reg_byte() call to make it clear that a regular
pointer is casted to an __iomem pointer.

Note: 'pkt' points to I/O memory for the qlafx00 adapter family and to
coherent memory for all other adapter families.

This patch fixes the following Coverity complaint:

CID 358864 (#1 of 1): Reliance on integer endianness (INCOMPATIBLE_CAST)
incompatible_cast: Pointer &pkt->handle points to an object whose effective
type is unsigned int (32 bits, unsigned) but is dereferenced as a narrower
unsigned short (16 bits, unsigned). This may lead to unexpected results
depending on machine endianness.
