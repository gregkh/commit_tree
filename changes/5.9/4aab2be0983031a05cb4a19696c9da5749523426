mm: khugepaged: recalculate min_free_kbytes after memory hotplug as expected by khugepaged

When memory is hotplug added or removed the min_free_kbytes should be
recalculated based on what is expected by khugepaged.  Currently after
hotplug, min_free_kbytes will be set to a lower default and higher
default set when THP enabled is lost.

This change restores min_free_kbytes as expected for THP consumers.
