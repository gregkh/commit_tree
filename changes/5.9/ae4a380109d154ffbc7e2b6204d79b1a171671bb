MAINTAINERS: change hardening mailing list

As more email from git history gets aimed at the OpenWall
kernel-hardening@ list, there has been a desire to separate "new topics"
from "on-going" work.

To handle this, the superset of hardening email topics are now to be
directed to linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org.

Update the MAINTAINERS file and the .mailmap to accomplish this, so that
linux-hardening@ can be treated like any other regular upstream kernel
development list.
