drm/i915/selftests: Trim execlists runtime

Reduce the smoke depth by trimming the number of contexts, repetitions
and wait times. This is in preparation for a less greedy scheduler that
tries to be fair across contexts, resulting in a great many more context
switches. A thousand context switches may be 50-100ms, causing us to
timeout as the HW is not fast enough to complete the deep smoketests.
