rxrpc: Fix rxkad token xdr encoding

The session key should be encoded with just the 8 data bytes and
no length; ENCODE_DATA precedes it with a 4 byte length, which
confuses some existing tools that try to parse this format.

Add an ENCODE_BYTES macro that does not include a length, and use
it for the key.  Also adjust the expected length.

Note that commit 774521f353e1d ("rxrpc: Fix an assertion in
rxrpc_read()") had fixed a BUG by changing the length rather than
fixing the encoding.  The original length was correct.
