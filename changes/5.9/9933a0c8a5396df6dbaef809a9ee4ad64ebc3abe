mm/migrate: clear __GFP_RECLAIM to make the migration callback consistent with regular THP allocations

new_page_nodemask is a migration callback and it tries to use a common gfp
flags for the target page allocation whether it is a base page or a THP.
The later only adds GFP_TRANSHUGE to the given mask.  This results in the
allocation being slightly more aggressive than necessary because the
resulting gfp mask will contain also __GFP_RECLAIM_KSWAPD.  THP
allocations usually exclude this flag to reduce over eager background
reclaim during a high THP allocation load which has been seen during large
mmaps initialization.  There is no indication that this is a problem for
migration as well but theoretically the same might happen when migrating
large mappings to a different node.  Make the migration callback
consistent with regular THP allocations.
