gpiolib: Disable compat ->read() code in UML case

It appears that UML (arch/um) has no compat.h header defined and hence
can't compile a recently provided piece of code in GPIO library.

Disable compat ->read() code in UML case to avoid compilation errors.

While at it, use pattern which is already being used in the kernel elsewhere.
