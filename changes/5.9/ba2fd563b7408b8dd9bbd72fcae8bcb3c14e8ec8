tools/bpftool: Support passing BPFTOOL_VERSION to make

This change facilitates out-of-tree builds, packaging, and versioning for
test and debug purposes. Defining BPFTOOL_VERSION allows self-contained
builds within the tools tree, since it avoids use of the 'kernelversion'
target in the top-level makefile, which would otherwise pull in several
other includes from outside the tools tree.
