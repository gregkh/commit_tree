bpf: Fail PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF when bpf_get_[stack|stackid] cannot work

bpf_get_[stack|stackid] on perf_events with precise_ip uses callchain
attached to perf_sample_data. If this callchain is not presented, do not
allow attaching BPF program that calls bpf_get_[stack|stackid] to this
event.

In the error case, -EPROTO is returned so that libbpf can identify this
error and print proper hint message.
