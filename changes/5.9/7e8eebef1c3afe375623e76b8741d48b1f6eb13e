misc: ti-st: st_core: Tidy-up bespoke commentry

If it's still in use and worth the effort, it sure looks like
this driver could do with a good scrub (clean).

This patch conserns itself with the non-standard comments located
thoughout the file.

It also fixes the following W=1 warnings by demoting the kerneldoc
function headers to standard comments, since there doesn't appear
to be a requirement for the function args to be documented:
