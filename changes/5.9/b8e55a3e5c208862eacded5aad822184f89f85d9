powerpc/kexec_file: Avoid stomping memory used by special regions

crashkernel region could have an overlap with special memory regions
like OPAL, RTAS, TCE table & such. These regions are referred to as
excluded memory ranges. Setup these ranges during image probe in order
to avoid them while finding the buffer for different kdump segments.
Override arch_kexec_locate_mem_hole() to locate a memory hole taking
these ranges into account.
