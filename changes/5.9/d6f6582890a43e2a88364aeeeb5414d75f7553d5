media: cx23885: use generic power management

The .suspend() and .resume() callbacks are not defined for this driver.
Still, their power management structure follows the legacy framework. To
bring it under the generic framework, simply remove the binding of
callbacks from struct "pci_driver".

Compile-tested only.
