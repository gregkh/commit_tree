scripts/dtc: only append to HOST_EXTRACFLAGS instead of overwriting

When building with

	$ HOST_EXTRACFLAGS=-g make

the expectation is that host tools are built with debug informations.
This however doesn't happen if the Makefile assigns a new value to the
HOST_EXTRACFLAGS instead of appending to it. So use += instead of := for
the first assignment.
