USB: sisusbvga: Fix a potential UB casued by left shifting a negative value

The char buffer buf, receives data directly from user space,
so its content might be negative and its elements are left
shifted to form an unsigned integer.

Since left shifting a negative value is undefined behavior, thus
change the char to u8 to elimintate this UB.
