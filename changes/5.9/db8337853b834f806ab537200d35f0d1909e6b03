drm/i915/gem: Only revoke mmap handlers if active

Avoid waking up the device and taking stale locks if we know that the
object is not currently mmapped. This is particularly useful as not many
object are actually mmapped and so we can destroy them without waking
the device up, and gives us a little more freedom of workqueue ordering
during shutdown.

v2: Pull the release_mmap() into its single user in freeing the objects,
where there can not be any race with a concurrent user of the freed
object. Or so one hopes!
