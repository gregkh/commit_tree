io_uring: don't use retry based buffered reads for non-async bdev

Some block devices, like dm, bubble back -EAGAIN through the completion
handler. We check for this in io_read(), but don't honor it for when
we have copied the iov. Return -EAGAIN for this case before retrying,
to force punt to io-wq.
