kbuild: stop filtering out $(GCC_PLUGINS_CFLAGS) from cc-option base

Commit d26e94149276 ("kbuild: no gcc-plugins during cc-option tests")
was neeeded because scripts/Makefile.gcc-plugins was too early.

This is unneeded by including scripts/Makefile.gcc-plugins last,
and being careful to not add cc-option tests after it.
