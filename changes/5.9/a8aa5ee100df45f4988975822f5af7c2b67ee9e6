remoteproc: Introduce rproc_of_parse_firmware() helper

Add a new helper function rproc_of_parse_firmware() to the remoteproc
core that can be used by various remoteproc drivers to look up the
the "firmware-name" property from a rproc device node. This property
is already being used by multiple drivers, so this helper can avoid
repeating equivalent code in remoteproc drivers.
