fsnotify: remove check that source dentry is positive

Remove the unneeded check for positive source dentry in
fsnotify_move().

fsnotify_move() hook is mostly called from vfs_rename() under
lock_rename() and vfs_rename() starts with may_delete() test that
verifies positive source dentry.  The only other caller of
fsnotify_move() - debugfs_rename() also verifies positive source.
