bnxt_en: Avoid sending firmware messages when AER error is detected.

When the driver goes through PCIe AER reset in error state, all
firmware messages will timeout because the PCIe bus is no longer
accessible.  This can lead to AER reset taking many minutes to
complete as each firmware command takes time to timeout.

Define a new macro BNXT_NO_FW_ACCESS() to skip these firmware messages
when either firmware is in fatal error state or when
pci_channel_offline() is true.  It now takes a more reasonable 20 to
30 seconds to complete AER recovery.
