net: lantiq: Add locking for TX DMA channel

The TX DMA channel data is accessed by the xrx200_start_xmit() and the
xrx200_tx_housekeeping() function from different threads. Make sure the
accesses are synchronized by acquiring the netif_tx_lock() in the
xrx200_tx_housekeeping() function too. This lock is acquired by the
kernel before calling xrx200_start_xmit().
