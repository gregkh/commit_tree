vt: introduce enum vc_intensity for intensity

Introduce names (en enum) for 0, 1, and 2 constants. We now have
VCI_HALF_BRIGHT, VCI_NORMAL, and VCI_BOLD instead.

Apart from the cleanup,
1) the enum allows for better type checking, and
2) this saves some code. No more fiddling with bits is needed in
   assembly now. (OTOH, the structure is larger.)
