mmc: cqhci: Demote faux kerneldoc header down to basic comment block

cqhci_host_alloc_tdl()'s function header is the only one in
kerneldoc format.  Which seems odd as it's not part of an
external API and isn't referenced anywhere else.  Seeing as
there has also been no attempt to describe the expected
function arguments either, we're going to assume that this is
not actually a bona fide kerneldoc use-case.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning:

 drivers/mmc/host/cqhci.c:163: warning: Function parameter or member 'cq_host' not described in 'cqhci_host_alloc_tdl'
