nfsd: avoid a NULL dereference in __cld_pipe_upcall()

If the rpc_pipefs is unmounted, then the rpc_pipe->dentry becomes NULL
and dereferencing the dentry->d_sb will trigger an oops.  The only
reason we're doing that is to determine the nfsd_net, which could
instead be passed in by the caller.  So do that instead.
