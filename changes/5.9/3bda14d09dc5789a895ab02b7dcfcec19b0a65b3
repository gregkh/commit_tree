batman-adv: Introduce a configurable per interface hop penalty

In some setups multiple hard interfaces with similar link qualities
or throughput values are available. But people have expressed the desire
to consider one of them as a backup only.

Some creative solutions are currently in use: Such people are
configuring multiple batman-adv mesh/soft interfaces, wire them
together with some veth pairs and then tune the hop penalty to achieve
an effect similar to a tunable per interface hop penalty.

This patch introduces a new, configurable, per hard interface hop penalty
to simplify such setups.
