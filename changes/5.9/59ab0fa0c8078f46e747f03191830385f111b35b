spi: spi-geni-qcom: Don't set {tx,rx}_rem_bytes unnecessarily

We only need to test for these counters being non-zero when we see the
end of a transfer. If we're doing a CS change then they will already be
zero.  This implies that we don't need to set these to 0 if we're
cancelling an in flight transfer too, because we only care to test these
counters when the 'DONE' bit is set in the hardware and we've set them
to non-zero for a transfer.

This is a non-functional change, just cleanup to consolidate code.
