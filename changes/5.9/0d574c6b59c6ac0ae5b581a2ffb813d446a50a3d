spi: spi-geni-qcom: Simplify setup_fifo_xfer()

The definition of SPI_FULL_DUPLEX (3) is really SPI_TX_ONLY (1) ORed
with SPI_RX_ONLY (2). Let's drop the define and simplify the code here a
bit by collapsing the setting of 'm_cmd' into conditions that are the
same.

This is a non-functional change, just cleanup to consolidate code.
