l2tp: don't export __l2tp_session_unhash

When __l2tp_session_unhash was first added it was used outside of
l2tp_core.c, but that's no longer the case.

As such, there's no longer a need to export the function.  Make it
private inside l2tp_core.c, and relocate it to avoid having to declare
the function prototype in l2tp_core.h.

Since the function is no longer used outside l2tp_core.c, remove the
"__" prefix since we don't need to indicate anything special about its
expected use to callers.
