rxrpc: Fix some missing _bh annotations on locking conn->state_lock

conn->state_lock may be taken in softirq mode, but a previous patch
replaced an outer lock in the response-packet event handling code, and lost
the _bh from that when doing so.

Fix this by applying the _bh annotation to the state_lock locking.
