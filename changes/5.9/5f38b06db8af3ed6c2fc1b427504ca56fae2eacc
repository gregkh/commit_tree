platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: initialize tp_nvram_state variable

clang static analysis flags this represenative problem
thinkpad_acpi.c:2523:7: warning: Branch condition evaluates
  to a garbage value
                if (!oldn->mute ||
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~

In hotkey_kthread() mute is conditionally set by hotkey_read_nvram()
but unconditionally checked by hotkey_compare_and_issue_event().
So the tp_nvram_state variable s[2] needs to be initialized.
