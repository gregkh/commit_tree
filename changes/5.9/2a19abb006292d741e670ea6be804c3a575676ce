drm/i915/gt: Assert the kernel context is using the HWSP

We need to ensure that the kernel context is using the permanently pinned
HWSP so that we can always submit a pm request from any context. By
construction, the engine->kernel_context should only be using the
engine->status_page.vma so let's assert that is still true when we have
to submit a request for parking the engine.
