nfs: ensure correct writeback errors are returned on close()

nfs_wb_all() calls filemap_write_and_wait(), which uses
filemap_check_errors() to determine the error to return.
filemap_check_errors() only looks at the mapping->flags and will
therefore only return either -ENOSPC or -EIO.  To ensure that the
correct error is returned on close(), nfs{,4}_file_flush() should call
filemap_check_wb_err() which looks at the errseq value in
mapping->wb_err without consuming it.

generic one")
