mmc: core: Mark fixups as __maybe_unused

Not all source files which include quirks.h make use of the all of
the available fixup information.  When this happens the compiler
complains that some constant variables are defined by never used.
We can fix this by telling the compiler that this intentional by
simply marking them as __maybe_unused.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warnings:
