tcp: syncookies: create mptcp request socket for ACK cookies with MPTCP option

If SYN packet contains MP_CAPABLE option, keep it enabled.
Syncokie validation and cookie-based socket creation is changed to
instantiate an mptcp request sockets if the ACK contains an MPTCP
connection request.

Rather than extend both cookie_v4/6_check, add a common helper to create
the (mp)tcp request socket.
