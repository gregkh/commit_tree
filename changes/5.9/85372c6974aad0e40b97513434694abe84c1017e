perf bench numa: Fix benchmark names

Standard benchmark names let users know the tests specifics.  For
example "2x1-bw-process" name tells that two processes one thread each
are run and the RAM bandwidth is measured.

Several benchmarks names do not correspond to their actual running
configuration. Fix that and also some whitespace and comment
inconsistencies.
