taprio: Fix using wrong queues in gate mask

Since commit 9c66d1564676 ("taprio: Add support for hardware
offloading") there's a bit of inconsistency when offloading schedules
to the hardware:

In software mode, the gate masks are specified in terms of traffic
classes, so if say "sched-entry S 03 20000", it means that the traffic
classes 0 and 1 are open for 20us; when taprio is offloaded to
hardware, the gate masks are specified in terms of hardware queues.

The idea here is to fix hardware offloading, so schedules in hardware
and software mode have the same behavior. What's needed to do is to
map traffic classes to queues when applying the offload to the driver.
