powerpc/book3s64/kuap: Move UAMOR setup to key init function

UAMOR values are not application-specific. The kernel initializes
its value based on different reserved keys. Remove the thread-specific
UAMOR value and don't switch the UAMOR on context switch.

Move UAMOR initialization to key initialization code and remove
thread_struct.uamor because it is not used anymore.

Before commit: 4a4a5e5d2aad ("powerpc/pkeys: key allocation/deallocation must not change pkey registers")
we used to update uamor based on key allocation and free.
