sched/uclamp: Fix initialization of struct uclamp_rq

struct uclamp_rq was zeroed out entirely in assumption that in the first
call to uclamp_rq_inc() they'd be initialized correctly in accordance to
default settings.

But when next patch introduces a static key to skip
uclamp_rq_{inc,dec}() until userspace opts in to use uclamp, schedutil
will fail to perform any frequency changes because the
rq->uclamp[UCLAMP_MAX].value is zeroed at init and stays as such. Which
means all rqs are capped to 0 by default.

Fix it by making sure we do proper initialization at init without
relying on uclamp_rq_inc() doing it later.
