ASoC: soc-component: merge snd_soc_component_read() and snd_soc_component_read32()

We had read/write function for Codec, Platform, etc,
but these has been merged into snd_soc_component_read/write().

Internally, it is using regmap or driver function.
In read case, each styles are like below

regmap
	ret = regmap_read(..., reg, &val);

driver function
	val = xxx->read(..., reg);

Because of this kind of different style, to keep same read style,
when we merged each read function into snd_soc_component_read(),
we created snd_soc_component_read32(), like below.
commit 738b49efe6c6 ("ASoC: add snd_soc_component_read32")

(1)	val = snd_soc_component_read32(component, reg);

(2)	ret = snd_soc_component_read(component, reg, &val);

Many drivers are using snd_soc_component_read32(), and
some drivers are using snd_soc_component_read() today.

In generally, we don't check read function successes,
because, we will have many other issues at initial timing
if read function didn't work.

Now we can use soc_component_err() when error case.
This means, it is easy to notice if error occurred.

This patch aggressively merge snd_soc_component_read() and _read32(),
and makes snd_soc_component_read/write() as generally style.

This patch do
	1) merge snd_soc_component_read() and snd_soc_component_read32()
	2) it uses soc_component_err() when error case (easy to notice)
	3) keeps read32 for now by #define
	4) update snd_soc_component_read() for all drivers

Because _read() user drivers are not too many, this patch changes
all user drivers.
