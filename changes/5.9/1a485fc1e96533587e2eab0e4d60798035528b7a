xfs: Factor out new helper functions xfs_attr_rmtval_set

Break xfs_attr_rmtval_set into two helper functions
xfs_attr_rmt_find_hole and xfs_attr_rmtval_set_value.
xfs_attr_rmtval_set rolls the transaction between the helpers, but
delayed operations cannot.  We will use the helpers later when
constructing new delayed attribute routines.
