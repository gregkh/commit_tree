arm64: tegra: Re-order PCIe aperture mappings

Re-order Tegra194's PCIe aperture mappings to have IO window moved to
64-bit aperture and have the entire 32-bit aperture used for accessing
the configuration space. This makes it to use the entire 32MB of the 32-bit
aperture for ECAM purpose while booting through ACPI.
