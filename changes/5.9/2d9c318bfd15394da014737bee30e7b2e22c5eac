docs: RCU: Don't duplicate chapter names in rculist_nulls.rst

Since changeset 58ad30cf91f0 ("docs: fix reference to core-api/namespaces.rst"),
auto-references for chapters are generated. This is a nice feature, but
has a drawback: no chapters can have the same sumber.

So, we need to add two higher hierarchy chapters on this document,
in order to avoid such duplication.
