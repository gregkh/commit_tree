irqchip/gic-v4.1: Ensure accessing the correct RD when writing INVALLR

The GICv4.1 spec tells us that it's CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE to issue a
register-based invalidation operation for a vPEID not mapped to that RD,
or another RD within the same CommonLPIAff group.

To follow this rule, commit f3a059219bc7 ("irqchip/gic-v4.1: Ensure mutual
exclusion between vPE affinity change and RD access") tried to address the
race between the RD accesses and the vPE affinity change, but somehow
forgot to take GICR_INVALLR into account. Let's take the vpe_lock before
evaluating vpe->col_idx to fix it.
