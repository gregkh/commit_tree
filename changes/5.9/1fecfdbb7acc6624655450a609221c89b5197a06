ACPI: processor: Take over RCU-idle for C3-BM idle

The C3 BusMaster idle code takes lock in a number of places, some deep
inside the ACPI code. Instead of wrapping it all in RCU_NONIDLE, have
the driver take over RCU-idle duty and avoid flipping RCU state back
and forth a lot.

( by marking 'C3 && bm_check' as RCU_IDLE, we _must_ call enter_bm() for
  that combination, otherwise we'll loose RCU-idle, this requires
  shuffling some code around )
