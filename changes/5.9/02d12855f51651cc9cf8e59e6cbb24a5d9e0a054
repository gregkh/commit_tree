thunderbolt: Implement USB4 port sideband operations for retimer access

USB4 spec specifies standard set of sideband operations that are send
over the low speed link to access either retimers on the link or the
link parter (the other router). The USB4 retimer spec extends these and
adds operations for retimer NVM upgrade.

This implements the retimer access and NVM upgrade USB4 port sideband
operations which we need for retimer support in the patch that follows.
