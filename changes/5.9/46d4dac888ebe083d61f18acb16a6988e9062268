btrfs: remove the start argument from btrfs_free_reserved_data_space_noquota()

The start argument for btrfs_free_reserved_data_space_noquota() is only
used to make sure the amount of bytes we decrement from the bytes_may_use
counter of the data space_info object is aligned to the filesystem's
sector size. It serves no other purpose.

All its current callers always pass a length argument that is already
aligned to the sector size, so we can make the start argument go away.
In fact its presence makes it impossible to use it in a context where we
just want to free a number of bytes for a range for which either we do
not know its start offset or for freeing multiple ranges at once (which
are not contiguous).

This change is preparatory work for a patch (third patch in this series)
that makes relocation of data block groups that are not full reserve less
data space.
