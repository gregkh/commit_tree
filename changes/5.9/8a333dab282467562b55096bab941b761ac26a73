platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Revert "Do not load on Asus T100TA and T200TA"

The WMI INIT method on for some reason turns on the camera LED on these
2-in-1s, without the WMI interface allowing further control over the LED.

To fix this commit b5f7311d3a2e ("platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Do not load
on Asus T100TA and T200TA") added a blacklist with these 2 models on it
since the WMI driver did not add any extra functionality to these models.

Recently I've been working on making more 2-in-1 models report their
tablet-mode (SW_TABLET_MODE) to userspace; and I've found that these 2
Asus models report this through WMI. This commit reverts the adding
of the blacklist, so that the Asus WMI driver can be used on these
models to report their tablet-mode. I have another patch fixing the LED
issue in a different manner.

Note this is the second time the we revert the adding of the
asus_nb_wmi_blacklist. It was reverted before in commit:

aab9e7896ec9 ("platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Revert "Do not load on Asus
T100TA and T200TA")"

But some how (accidentally re-applying of the patch?) it got re-added
again in commit 3bd12da7f50b ("platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Do not load
on Asus T100TA and T200TA"), so now we need to revert it again.
