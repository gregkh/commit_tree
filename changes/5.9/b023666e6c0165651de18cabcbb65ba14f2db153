ASoC: wm8962: Do not remove ADDITIONAL_CONTROL_4 from readable register list

Removing ADDITIONAL_CONTROL_4 from the list of readable registers cause
audio distortion.

This change was sent as a comment below the --- line when submitting
commit 658bb297e393 ("ASoC: wm8962: Do not access WM8962_GPIO_BASE"), so
it was not supposed to get merged.

Keep WM8962_ADDITIONAL_CONTROL_4 inside wm8962_readable_register() to
fix the regression.
