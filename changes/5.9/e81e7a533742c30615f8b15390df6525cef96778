selftests/bpf: Fix possible hang in sockopt_inherit

Andrii reported that sockopt_inherit occasionally hangs up on 5.5 kernel [0].
This can happen if server_thread runs faster than the main thread.
In that case, pthread_cond_wait will wait forever because
pthread_cond_signal was executed before the main thread was blocking.
Let's move pthread_mutex_lock up a bit to make sure server_thread
runs strictly after the main thread goes to sleep.

(Not sure why this is 5.5 specific, maybe scheduling is less
deterministic? But I was able to confirm that it does indeed
happen in a VM.)
