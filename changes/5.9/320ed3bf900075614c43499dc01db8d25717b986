net: phy: split devices_in_package

We have two competing requirements for the devices_in_package field.
We want to use it as a bit array indicating which MMDs are present, but
we also want to know if the Clause 22 registers are present.

Since "devices in package" is a term used in the 802.3 specification,
keep this as the as-specified values read from the PHY, and introduce
a new member "mmds_present" to indicate which MMDs are actually
present in the PHY, derived from the "devices in package" value.
