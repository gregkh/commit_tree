powerpc/ptdump: Refactor update of pg_state

In note_page(), the pg_state is updated the same way in two places.

Add note_page_update_state() to do it.

Also include the display of boundary markers there as it is missing
"no level" leg, leading to a mismatch when the first two markers
are at the same address and the first displayed area uses that
address.
