fs: dlm: change handling of reconnects

This patch changes the handling of reconnects. At first we only close
the connection related to the communication failure. If we get a new
connection for an already existing connection we close the existing
connection and take the new one.

This patch improves significantly the stability of tcp connections while
running "tcpkill -9 -i $IFACE port 21064" while generating a lot of dlm
messages e.g. on a gfs2 mount with many files. My test setup shows that a
deadlock is "more" unlikely. Before this patch I wasn't able to get
not a deadlock after 5 seconds. After this patch my observation is
that it's more likely to survive after 5 seconds and more, but still a
deadlock occurs after certain time. My guess is that there are still
"segments" inside the tcp writequeue or retransmit queue which get dropped
when receiving a tcp reset [1]. Hard to reproduce because the right message
need to be inside these queues, which might even be in the 5 first seconds
with this patch.
