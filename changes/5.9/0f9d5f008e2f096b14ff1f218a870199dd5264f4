dmaengine: dw: Initialize max_sg_burst capability

Multi-block support provides a way to map the kernel-specific SG-table so
the DW DMA device would handle it as a whole instead of handling the
SG-list items or so called LLP block items one by one. So if true LLP
list isn't supported by the DW DMA engine, then soft-LLP mode will be
utilized to load and execute each LLP-block one by one. The soft-LLP mode
of the DMA transactions execution might not work well for some DMA
consumers like SPI due to its Tx and Rx buffers inter-dependency. Let's
initialize the max_sg_burst DMA channels capability based on the nollp
flag state. If it's true, no hardware accelerated LLP is available and
max_sg_burst should be set with 1, which means that the DMA engine
can handle only a single SG list entry at a time. If noLLP is set to
false, then hardware accelerated LLP is supported and the DMA engine
can handle infinite number of SG entries in a single DMA transaction.
