drm/i915: Move the engine mask to intel_gt_info

Since the engines belong to the GT, move the runtime-updated list of
available engines to the intel_gt struct. The original mask has been
renamed to indicate it contains the maximum engine list that can be
found on a matching device.

In preparation for other info being moved to the gt in follow up patches
(sseu), introduce an intel_gt_info structure to group all gt-related
runtime info.

v2: s/max_engine_mask/platform_engine_mask (tvrtko), fix selftest
