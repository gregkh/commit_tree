net: ena: support new LLQ acceleration mode

New devices add a new hardware acceleration engine, which adds some
restrictions to the driver.
Metadata descriptor must be present for each packet and the maximum
burst size between two doorbells is now limited to a number
advertised by the device.

This patch adds:
1. A handshake protocol between the driver and the device, so the
device will enable the accelerated queues only when both sides
support it.

2. The driver support for the new acceleration engine:
2.1. Send metadata descriptor for each Tx packet.
2.2. Limit the number of packets sent between doorbells.(*)

(*) A previous driver implementation of this feature was comitted in
commit 05d62ca218f8 ("net: ena: add handling of llq max tx burst size")
however the design of the interface between the driver and device
changed since then. This change is reflected in this commit.
