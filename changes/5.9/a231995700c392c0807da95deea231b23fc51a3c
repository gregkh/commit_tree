MIPS: perf: Fix wrong check condition of Loongson event IDs

According to the user's manual chapter 8.2.1 of Loongson 3A2000 CPU [1]
and 3A3000 CPU [2], we should take some event IDs such as 274, 358, 359
and 360 as valid in the check condition, otherwise they are recognized
as "not supported", fix it.
