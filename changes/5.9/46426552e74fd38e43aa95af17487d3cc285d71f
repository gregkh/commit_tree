scsi: ufs-mediatek: Add inline encryption support

Add inline encryption support to ufs-mediatek.

The standards-compliant parts, such as querying the crypto capabilities and
enabling crypto for individual UFS requests, are already handled by
ufshcd-crypto.c, which itself is wired into the blk-crypto framework.

However MediaTek UFS host requires a vendor-specific hce_enable operation
to allow crypto-related registers being accessed normally in kernel.  After
this step, MediaTek UFS host can work as standard-compliant host for
inline-encryption related functions.
