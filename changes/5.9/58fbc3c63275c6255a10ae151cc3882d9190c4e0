ring-buffer: Consolidate add_timestamp to remove some branches

Reorganize a little the logic to handle adding the absolute time stamp,
extended and forced time stamps, in such a way to remove a branch or two.
This is just a micro optimization.

Also add before and after time stamps to the rb_event_info structure to
display those values in the rb_check_timestamps() code, if something were to
go wrong.
