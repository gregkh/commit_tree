mmc: sdhci: Workaround broken command queuing on Intel GLK based IRBIS models

Commit bedf9fc01ff1 ("mmc: sdhci: Workaround broken command queuing on
Intel GLK"), disabled command-queuing on Intel GLK based LENOVO models
because of it being broken due to what is believed to be a bug in
the BIOS.

It seems that the BIOS of some IRBIS models, including the IRBIS NB111
model has the same issue, so disable command queuing there too.
