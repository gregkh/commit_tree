crypto: af_alg - Fix regression on empty requests

Some user-space programs rely on crypto requests that have no
control metadata.  This broke when a check was added to require
the presence of control metadata with the ctx->init flag.

This patch fixes the regression by setting ctx->init as long as
one sendmsg(2) has been made, with or without a control message.
