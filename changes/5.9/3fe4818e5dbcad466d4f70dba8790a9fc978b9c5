drm/i915/tgl: Clamp min_cdclk to max_cdclk_freq to unblock 8K

We still need "Bump up CDCLK" workaround otherwise getting
underruns - however currently it blocks 8K as CDCLK = Pixel rate,
in 8K case would require CDCLK to be around 1 Ghz which is not
possible.

v2: - Convert to expression(max(min_cdclk, min(pixel_rate, max_cdclk))
      (Ville Syrj채l채)
    - Use type specific min_t, max_t(Ville Syrj채l채)
