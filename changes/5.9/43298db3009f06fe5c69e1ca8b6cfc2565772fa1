cpufreq: intel_pstate: Refuse to turn off with HWP enabled

After commit f6ebbcf08f37 ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Implement passive
mode with HWP enabled") it is possible to change the driver status
to "off" via sysfs with HWP enabled, which effectively causes the
driver to unregister itself, but HWP remains active and it forces the
minimum performance, so even if another cpufreq driver is loaded,
it will not be able to control the CPU frequency.

For this reason, make the driver refuse to change the status to
"off" with HWP enabled.
