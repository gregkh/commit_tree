gpio: max77620: Initialize hardware state of interrupts

I noticed on Nexus 7 that after rebooting from downstream kernel to
upstream, the GPIO interrupt is triggering non-stop despite interrupts
being disabled for all of GPIOs. This happens because Nexus 7 uses a
soft-reboot, meaning that bootloader should take care of resetting
hardware, but the bootloader doesn't do it well. As a result, GPIO
interrupt may be left ON at a boot time. Let's mask all GPIO interrupts
at the driver's initialization time in order to resolve the issue.
