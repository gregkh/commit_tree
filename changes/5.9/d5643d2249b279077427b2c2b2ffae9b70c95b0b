USB: Fix device driver race

When a new device with a specialised device driver is plugged in, the
new driver will be modprobe()'d but the driver core will attach the
"generic" driver to the device.

After that, nothing will trigger a reprobe when the modprobe()'d device
driver has finished initialising, as the device has the "generic"
driver attached to it.

Trigger a reprobe ourselves when new specialised drivers get registered.
