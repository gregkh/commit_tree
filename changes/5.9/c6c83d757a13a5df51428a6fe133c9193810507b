arm64/cpufeature: Validate feature bits spacing in arm64_ftr_regs[]

arm64_feature_bits for a register in arm64_ftr_regs[] are in a descending
order as per their shift values. Validate that these features bits are
defined correctly and do not overlap with each other. This check protects
against any inadvertent erroneous changes to the register definitions.
