sh: landisk: Add missing initialization of sh_io_port_base

The Landisk setup code maps the CF IDE area using ioremap_prot(), and
passes the resulting virtual addresses to the pata_platform driver,
disguising them as I/O port addresses.  Hence the pata_platform driver
translates them again using ioport_map().
As CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP=n, and CONFIG_HAS_IOPORT_MAP=y, the
SuperH-specific mapping code in arch/sh/kernel/ioport.c translates
I/O port addresses to virtual addresses by adding sh_io_port_base, which
defaults to -1, thus breaking the assumption of an identity mapping.

Fix this by setting sh_io_port_base to zero.
