spi: fsl-espi: Only process interrupts for expected events

The SPIE register contains counts for the TX FIFO so any time the irq
handler was invoked we would attempt to process the RX/TX fifos. Use the
SPIM value to mask the events so that we only process interrupts that
were expected.

This was a latent issue exposed by commit 3282a3da25bd ("powerpc/64:
Implement soft interrupt replay in C").
