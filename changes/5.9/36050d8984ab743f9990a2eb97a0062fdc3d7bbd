cpuidle: psci: Fix suspicious RCU usage

The commit eb1f00237aca ("lockdep,trace: Expose tracepoints"), started to
expose us for tracepoints. This lead to the following RCU splat on an ARM64
Qcom board.

Following the path in pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() from
psci_enter_domain_idle_state(), it seems like we end up using the RCU.
Therefore, let's simply silence the splat by informing the RCU about it
with RCU_NONIDLE.

Note that, this is a temporary solution. Instead we should strive to avoid
using RCU_NONIDLE (and similar), but rather push rcu_idle_enter|exit()
further down, closer to the arch specific code. However, as the CPU PM
notifiers are also using the RCU, additional rework is needed.
