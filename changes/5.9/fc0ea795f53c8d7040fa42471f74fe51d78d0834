ftrace: Add symbols for ftrace trampolines

Symbols are needed for tools to describe instruction addresses. Pages
allocated for ftrace's purposes need symbols to be created for them.
Add such symbols to be visible via /proc/kallsyms.

Example on x86 with CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=y

	# echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
	# cat /proc/kallsyms | grep '\[__builtin__ftrace\]'
	ffffffffc0238000 t ftrace_trampoline    [__builtin__ftrace]

Note: This patch adds "__builtin__ftrace" as a module name in /proc/kallsyms for
symbols for pages allocated for ftrace's purposes, even though "__builtin__ftrace"
is not a module.
