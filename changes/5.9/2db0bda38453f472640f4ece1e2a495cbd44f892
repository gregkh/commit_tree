refperf: Add warmup and cooldown processing phases

This commit causes all the readers to start running unmeasured load
until all readers have done at least one such run (thus having warmed
up), then run the measured load, and then run unmeasured load until all
readers have completed their measured load.  This approach avoids any
thread running measured load while other readers are idle.
