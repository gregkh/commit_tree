net: core: document two new elements of struct net_device

As warned by "make htmldocs", there are two new struct elements
that aren't documented:

	../include/linux/netdevice.h:2159: warning: Function parameter or member 'unlink_list' not described in 'net_device'
	../include/linux/netdevice.h:2159: warning: Function parameter or member 'nested_level' not described in 'net_device'

Fixes: 1fc70edb7d7b ("net: core: add nested_level variable in net_device")
