bpf: Fix sysfs export of empty BTF section

If BTF data is missing or removed from the ELF section it is still exported
via sysfs as a zero-length file:

  root@OpenWrt:/# ls -l /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
  -r--r--r--    1 root    root    0 Jul 18 02:59 /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux

Moreover, reads from this file succeed and leak kernel data:

  root@OpenWrt:/# hexdump -C /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux|head -10
  000000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................|

  002670 80 25 44 dc 80 85 97 80 81 a9 50 24 81 ab c4 60 |.%D.......P$...`|

This situation was first observed with kernel 5.4.x, cross-compiled for a
MIPS target system. Fix by adding a sanity-check for export of zero-length
data sections.
