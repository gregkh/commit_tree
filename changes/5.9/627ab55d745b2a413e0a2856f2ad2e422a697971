ASoC: qcom: common: Use snd_soc_dai_link_set_capabilities()

Commit a2120089251f ("ASoC: qcom: common: set correct directions for dailinks")
introduced a call to q6afe_is_rx_port() to set the dpcm_playback/capture
parameters correctly. This is necessary because those parameters are now
validated to match the capabilities of the DAIs. [1]

The disadvantage of introducing the call to q6afe_is_rx_port() is that
it makes the qcom_snd_parse_of() helper dependent on the QDSP6 driver.
When the ADSP is bypassed (e.g. in apq8016-sbc) QDSP6 is not used.

There is a generic solution for this now: The correct direction for the links
is already defined by the DAI capabilities (e.g. rx ports only support playback).

Commit 25612477d20b ("ASoC: soc-dai: set dai_link dpcm_ flags with a helper")
introduced the snd_soc_dai_link_set_capabilities() function that we can use
to set dpcm_playback/dpcm_capture according to the capabilities of the DAIs.

Use that for both FE/BE DAI links to avoid the dependency on the QDSP6 driver.
