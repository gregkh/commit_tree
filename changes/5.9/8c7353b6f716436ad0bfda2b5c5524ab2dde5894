net/mlx5e: Fix VLAN cleanup flow

Prior to this patch unloading an interface in promiscuous mode with RX
VLAN filtering feature turned off - resulted in a warning. This is due
to a wrong condition in the VLAN rules cleanup flow, which left the
any-vid rules in the VLAN steering table. These rules prevented
destroying the flow group and the flow table.

The any-vid rules are removed in 2 flows, but none of them remove it in
case both promiscuous is set and VLAN filtering is off. Fix the issue by
changing the condition of the VLAN table cleanup flow to clean also in
case of promiscuous mode.
