rbd: require global CAP_SYS_ADMIN for mapping and unmapping

It turns out that currently we rely only on sysfs attribute
permissions:

  $ ll /sys/bus/rbd/{add*,remove*}
  --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/add
  --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major
  --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:37 /sys/bus/rbd/remove
  --w------- 1 root root 4096 Sep  3 20:38 /sys/bus/rbd/remove_single_major

This means that images can be mapped and unmapped (i.e. block devices
can be created and deleted) by a UID 0 process even after it drops all
privileges or by any process with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE in its user namespace
as long as UID 0 is mapped into that user namespace.

Be consistent with other virtual block devices (loop, nbd, dm, md, etc)
and require CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the initial user namespace for mapping and
unmapping, and also for dumping the configuration string and refreshing
the image header.
