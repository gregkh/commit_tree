nvme-tcp: fix reset hang if controller died in the middle of a reset

If the controller becomes unresponsive in the middle of a reset, we will
hang because we are waiting for the freeze to complete, but that cannot
happen since we have commands that are inflight holding the
q_usage_counter, and we can't blindly fail requests that times out.

So give a timeout and if we cannot wait for queue freeze before
unfreezing, fail and have the error handling take care how to proceed
(either schedule a reconnect of remove the controller).
