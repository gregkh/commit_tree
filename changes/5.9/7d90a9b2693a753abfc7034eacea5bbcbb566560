Revert "mtd: spi-nor: Disable the flash quad mode in spi_nor_restore()"

Previous patch intends to restore the flash's QE bit when removed/shutdown,
but may have some problems and break the flash:

- for those originally in Quad mode, this patch will clear the QE bit
  when unloaded the flash, which is incorrect.
- even with above problem solved, it may still break the flash as some
  flash's QE bit is non-volatile and lots of set/reset will wear out
  the bit.
- the restore method cannot be proved to be valid as if a hard
  reset or accident crash happened, the spi_nor_restore() won't be
  performed the the QE bit will not be restored as we expected to.

So let's revert it to fix this. The discussion can be found at [1].

This reverts commit cc59e6bb6cd69d3347c06ccce088c5c6052e041e.
