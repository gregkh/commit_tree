EDAC: Fix reference count leaks

When kobject_init_and_add() returns an error, it should be handled
because kobject_init_and_add() takes a reference even when it fails. If
this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to properly
clean up the memory associated with the object.

Therefore, replace calling kfree() and call kobject_put() and add a
missing kobject_put() in the edac_device_register_sysfs_main_kobj()
error path.

 [ bp: Massage and merge into a single patch. ]
