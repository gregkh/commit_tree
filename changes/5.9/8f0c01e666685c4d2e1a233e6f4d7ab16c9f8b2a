platform/x86: fix kconfig dependency warning for LG_LAPTOP

When LG_LAPTOP is enabled and NEW_LEDS is disabled, it results in the
following Kbuild warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for LEDS_CLASS
  Depends on [n]: NEW_LEDS [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - LG_LAPTOP [=y] && X86 [=y] && X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES [=y] && ACPI [=y] && ACPI_WMI [=y] && INPUT [=y]

The reason is that LG_LAPTOP selects LEDS_CLASS without depending on or
selecting NEW_LEDS while LEDS_CLASS is subordinate to NEW_LEDS.

Honor the kconfig menu hierarchy to remove kconfig dependency warnings.
