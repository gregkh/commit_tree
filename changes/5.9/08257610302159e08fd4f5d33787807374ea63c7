arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Drop the unused non-MSA SID

Having a non-MSA (Modem Self-Authentication) SID bypassed breaks modem
sandboxing i.e if a transaction were to originate from it, the hardware
memory protections units (XPUs) would fail to flag them (any transaction
originating from modem are historically termed as an MSA transaction).
Drop the unused non-MSA modem SID on SC7180 SoCs and cheza so that SMMU
continues to block them.
