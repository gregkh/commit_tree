vt: use tty_insert_flip_string in respond_string

Pass the length of a string to respond_string and use
tty_insert_flip_string instead of a loop with tty_insert_flip_char. This
simplifies the processing on the tty side.

The added strlens are optimized during constant folding and propagation
and the result are proper constants in assembly.
