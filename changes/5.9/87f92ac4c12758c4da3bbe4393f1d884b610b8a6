libbpf: Fix XDP program load regression for old kernels

Fix regression in libbpf, introduced by XDP link change, which causes XDP
programs to fail to be loaded into kernel due to specified BPF_XDP
expected_attach_type. While kernel doesn't enforce expected_attach_type for
BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP, some old kernels already support XDP program, but they
don't yet recognize expected_attach_type field in bpf_attr, so setting it to
non-zero value causes program load to fail.

Luckily, libbpf already has a mechanism to deal with such cases, so just make
expected_attach_type optional for XDP programs.
