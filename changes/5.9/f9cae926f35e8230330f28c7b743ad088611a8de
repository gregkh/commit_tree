writeback: Fix sync livelock due to b_dirty_time processing

When we are processing writeback for sync(2), move_expired_inodes()
didn't set any inode expiry value (older_than_this). This can result in
writeback never completing if there's steady stream of inodes added to
b_dirty_time list as writeback rechecks dirty lists after each writeback
round whether there's more work to be done. Fix the problem by using
sync(2) start time is inode expiry value when processing b_dirty_time
list similarly as for ordinarily dirtied inodes. This requires some
refactoring of older_than_this handling which simplifies the code
noticeably as a bonus.
