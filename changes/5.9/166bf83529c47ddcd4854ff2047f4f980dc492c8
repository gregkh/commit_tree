cpuidle: psci: Fix error path via converting to a platform driver

The current error paths for the cpuidle-psci driver, may leak memory or
possibly leave CPU devices attached to their PM domains. These are quite
harmless issues, but still deserves to be taken care of.

Although, rather than fixing them by keeping track of allocations that
needs to be freed, which tends to become a bit messy, let's convert into a
platform driver. In this way, it gets easier to fix the memory leaks as we
can rely on the devm_* functions.

Moreover, converting to a platform driver also enables support for deferred
probe, which subsequent changes takes benefit from.
