s390: don't trace preemption in percpu macros

Since commit a21ee6055c30 ("lockdep: Change hardirq{s_enabled,_context}
to per-cpu variables") the lockdep code itself uses percpu variables. This
leads to recursions because the percpu macros are calling preempt_enable()
which might call trace_preempt_on().
