crypto: x86/chacha-sse3 - use unaligned loads for state array

Due to the fact that the x86 port does not support allocating objects
on the stack with an alignment that exceeds 8 bytes, we have a rather
ugly hack in the x86 code for ChaCha to ensure that the state array is
aligned to 16 bytes, allowing the SSE3 implementation of the algorithm
to use aligned loads.

Given that the performance benefit of using of aligned loads appears to
be limited (~0.25% for 1k blocks using tcrypt on a Corei7-8650U), and
the fact that this hack has leaked into generic ChaCha code, let's just
remove it.
