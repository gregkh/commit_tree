mm/arm: use general page fault accounting

Use the general page fault accounting by passing regs into
handle_mm_fault().  It naturally solve the issue of multiple page fault
accounting when page fault retry happened.  To do this, we need to pass
the pt_regs pointer into __do_page_fault().

Fix PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS perf event manually for page fault retries,
by moving it before taking mmap_sem.
