lockdep: Refactor IRQ trace events fields into struct

Refactor the IRQ trace events fields, used for printing information
about the IRQ trace events, into a separate struct 'irqtrace_events'.

This improves readability by separating the information only used in
reporting, as well as enables (simplified) storing/restoring of
irqtrace_events snapshots.

No functional change intended.
