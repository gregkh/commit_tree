ARM: dts: logicpd-som-lv-baseboard: Fix missing video

A previous commit removed the panel-dpi driver, which made the
SOM-LV video stop working because it relied on the DPI driver
for setting video timings.  Now that the simple-panel driver is
available in omap2plus, this patch migrates the SOM-LV dev kits
to use a similar panel and remove the manual timing requirements.
A similar patch was already done and applied to the Torpedo family.

Fixes: 8bf4b1621178 ("drm/omap: Remove panel-dpi driver")
