spi: spi-sun6i: sun6i_spi_transfer_one(): enable RF_RDY interrupt only if needed

In sun6i_spi_transfer_one() the RX FIFO Ready (SUN6I_INT_CTL_RF_RDY) is
unconditionally enabled.

A RX interrupt is only needed, if more data than fits into the FIFO is going to
be received during this transfer. As the RX-FIFO is drained during transfer
complete interrupt, enable the RX FIFO Ready interrupt only if the data doesn't
fit into the FIFO.
