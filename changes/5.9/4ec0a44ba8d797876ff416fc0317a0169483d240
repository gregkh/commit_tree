of_graph: add of_graph_is_present()

In some cases it's very useful to silently check whether port node exists
at all in a device-tree before proceeding with parsing the graph. The DRM
bridges code is one example of such case where absence of a graph in a
device-tree is a legit condition.

This patch adds of_graph_is_present() which returns true if given
device-tree node contains OF graph port.
