exec: change uselib(2) IS_SREG() failure to EACCES

Patch series "Relocate execve() sanity checks", v2.

While looking at the code paths for the proposed O_MAYEXEC flag, I saw
some things that looked like they should be fixed up.

  exec: Change uselib(2) IS_SREG() failure to EACCES
	This just regularizes the return code on uselib(2).

  exec: Move S_ISREG() check earlier
	This moves the S_ISREG() check even earlier than it was already.

  exec: Move path_noexec() check earlier
	This adds the path_noexec() check to the same place as the
	S_ISREG() check.

This patch (of 3):

Change uselib(2)' S_ISREG() error return to EACCES instead of EINVAL so
the behavior matches execve(2), and the seemingly documented value.  The
"not a regular file" failure mode of execve(2) is explicitly
documented[1], but it is not mentioned in uselib(2)[2] which does,
however, say that open(2) and mmap(2) errors may apply.  The documentation
for open(2) does not include a "not a regular file" error[3], but mmap(2)
does[4], and it is EACCES.
