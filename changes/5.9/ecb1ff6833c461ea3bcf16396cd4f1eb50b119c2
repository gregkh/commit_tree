s390/debug: remove raw view

There is not a single user of the debug raw view. Therefore remove it
before anybody uses it. If anybody would make use of the view it would
expose the struct __debug_entry definition to userspace and really
would make it uapi. This wouldn't be good, since the definition is
suboptimal and needs to be changed.

Right now the structure definition is only defined to be uapi, however
there is no user.
