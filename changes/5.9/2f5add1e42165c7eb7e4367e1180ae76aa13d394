regulator: wm8350-regulator: Repair odd formatting in documentation

Kerneldoc expects function arguments to be in the format '@.*:'.  If
this format is not followed the kerneldoc tooling/parsers/validators
get confused.

Fixes the following W=1 warning(s):

 drivers/regulator/wm8350-regulator.c:1234: warning: Function parameter or member 'wm8350' not described in 'wm8350_register_led'
 drivers/regulator/wm8350-regulator.c:1234: warning: Function parameter or member 'lednum' not described in 'wm8350_register_led'
