drm/i915: Move all FBC w/as to .init_clock_gating()

Some platforms apply the FBC w/as in .init_clock_gating(), some
in fbc_activate(). Move them all to .init_clock_gating() for
consistentce. Also safer since we don't have to worry about the
RMWs clashing with any other runtime use of the same registers.
