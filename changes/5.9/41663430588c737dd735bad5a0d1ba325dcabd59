mm, THP, swap: fix allocating cluster for swapfile by mistake

SWP_FS is used to make swap_{read,write}page() go through the
filesystem, and it's only used for swap files over NFS.  So, !SWP_FS
means non NFS for now, it could be either file backed or device backed.
Something similar goes with legacy SWP_FILE.

So in order to achieve the goal of the original patch, SWP_BLKDEV should
be used instead.

FS corruption can be observed with SSD device + XFS + fragmented
swapfile due to CONFIG_THP_SWAP=y.

I reproduced the issue with the following details:

Environment:

  QEMU + upstream kernel + buildroot + NVMe (2 GB)

Kernel config:

  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NVME=y
  CONFIG_THP_SWAP=y

Some reproducible steps:

  mkfs.xfs -f /dev/nvme0n1
  mkdir /tmp/mnt
  mount /dev/nvme0n1 /tmp/mnt
  bs="32k"
  sz="1024m"    # doesn't matter too much, I also tried 16m
  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -R -b $bs 0 $sz" -c "fdatasync" /tmp/mnt/sw
  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -R -b $bs 0 $sz" -c "fdatasync" /tmp/mnt/sw
  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -R -b $bs 0 $sz" -c "fdatasync" /tmp/mnt/sw
  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -F -S 0 -b $bs 0 $sz" -c "fdatasync" /tmp/mnt/sw
  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -R -b $bs 0 $sz" -c "fsync" /tmp/mnt/sw

  mkswap /tmp/mnt/sw
  swapon /tmp/mnt/sw

  stress --vm 2 --vm-bytes 600M   # doesn't matter too much as well

Symptoms:
 - FS corruption (e.g. checksum failure)
 - memory corruption at: 0xd2808010
 - segfault
