Documentation/llvm: Improve formatting of commands, variables, and arguments

While reviewing a separate patch, I noticed that the formatting of the
commands, variables, and arguments was not in a monospaced font like the
rest of the Kbuild documentation (see kbuild/kconfig.rst for an
example). This is due to a lack of "::" before indented command blocks
and single backticks instead of double backticks for inline formatting.

Add those so that the document looks nicer in an HTML format, while not
ruining the look in plain text.

As a result of this, we can remove the escaped backslashes in the last
code block and move them to single backslashes.
