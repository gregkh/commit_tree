bcache: handle c->uuids properly for bucket size > 8MB

Bcache allocates a whole bucket to store c->uuids on cache device, and
allocates continuous pages to store it in-memory. When the bucket size
exceeds maximum allocable continuous pages, bch_cache_set_alloc() will
fail and cache device registration will fail.

This patch allocates c->uuids by alloc_meta_bucket_pages(), and uses
ilog2(meta_bucket_pages(c)) to indicate order of c->uuids pages when
free it. When writing c->uuids to cache device, its size is decided
by meta_bucket_pages(c) * PAGE_SECTORS. Now c->uuids is properly handled
for bucket size > 8MB.
