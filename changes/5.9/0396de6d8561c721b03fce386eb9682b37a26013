powerpc/sstep: Add tests for prefixed floating-point load/stores

Add tests for the prefixed versions of the floating-point load/stores
that are currently tested. This includes the following instructions:
  * Prefixed Load Floating-Point Single (plfs)
  * Prefixed Load Floating-Point Double (plfd)
  * Prefixed Store Floating-Point Single (pstfs)
  * Prefixed Store Floating-Point Double (pstfd)

Skip the new tests if ISA v3.10 is unsupported.
