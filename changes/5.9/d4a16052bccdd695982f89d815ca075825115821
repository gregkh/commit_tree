net/mlx5e: Fix VLAN create flow

When interface is attached while in promiscuous mode and with VLAN
filtering turned off, both configurations are not respected and VLAN
filtering is performed.
There are 2 flows which add the any-vid rules during interface attach:
VLAN creation table and set rx mode. Each is relaying on the other to
add any-vid rules, eventually non of them does.

Fix this by adding any-vid rules on VLAN creation regardless of
promiscuous mode.
