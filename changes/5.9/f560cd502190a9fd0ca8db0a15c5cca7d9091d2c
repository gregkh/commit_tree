platform/x86: pcengines-apuv2: revert wiring up simswitch GPIO as LED

This reverts commit 5037d4ddda31c2dbbb018109655f61054b1756dc.

Explanation why this does not work:
This change connects the simswap to the LED subsystem of the kernel.
From my point of view, it's nonsense. If we do it this way, then this
can be switched relatively easily via the LED subsystem (trigger:
none/default-on) and that is dangerous! If this is used, it would be
unfavorable, since there is also another trigger (trigger:
heartbeat/netdev).

Therefore, this simswap GPIO should remain in the GPIO
subsystem and be switched via it and not be connected to the LED
subsystem. To avoid the problems mentioned above. The LED subsystem is
not made for this and it is not a good compromise, but rather dangerous.
