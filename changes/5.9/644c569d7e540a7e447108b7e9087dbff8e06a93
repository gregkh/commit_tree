arm64: tegra: Use proper tuple notation

Tuple boundaries should be marked by < and > to make it clear which
cells are part of the same tuple. This also helps the json-schema based
validation tooling to properly parse this data.

While at it, also remove the "immovable" bit from PCI addresses. All of
these addresses are in fact "movable".
