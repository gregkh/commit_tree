drm/amd/display: Use VUPDATE_NO_LOCK instead of VUPDATE for dcn30

[Why]
Soft hangs occur when FreeSync is engaged since we utilize VUPDATE
(which doesn't fire when holding the pipe lock) to send back vblank
events when FreeSync is active.

[How]
The alternative (working) interrupt source for this mechanism is
VUPDATE_NO_LOCK. We already use this all other DCN revisions so align
dcn30 with those as well.
