misc: pti: Remove unparsable empty line in function header

The kerneldoc tooling/parsers/validators get confused if non-
standard formatting is used.  The first line after the kerneldoc
identifier '/**' must not be blank else the following warnings
will be issued:

 drivers/misc/pti.c:902: warning: Cannot understand  *
 on line 902 - I thought it was a doc line
