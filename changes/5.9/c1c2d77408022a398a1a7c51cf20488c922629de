bnxt_en: Don't query FW when netif_running() is false.

In rare conditions like two stage OS installation, the
ethtool's get_channels function may be called when the
device is in D3 state, leading to uncorrectable PCI error.
Check netif_running() first before making any query to FW
which involves writing to BAR.
