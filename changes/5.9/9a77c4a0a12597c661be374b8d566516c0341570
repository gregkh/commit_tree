powerpc/prom: Enable Radix GTSE in cpu pa-features

When '029ab30b4c0a ("powerpc/mm: Enable radix GTSE only if supported.")'
made GTSE an MMU feature, it was enabled by default in
powerpc-cpu-features but was missed in pa-features. This causes random
memory corruption during boot of PowerNV kernels where
CONFIG_PPC_DT_CPU_FTRS isn't enabled.

Fixes: 029ab30b4c0a ("powerpc/mm: Enable radix GTSE only if supported.")
