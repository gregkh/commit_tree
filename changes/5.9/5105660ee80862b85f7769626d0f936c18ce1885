clk: tegra: Always program PLL_E when enabled

Commit bff1cef5f23a ("clk: tegra: Don't enable already enabled PLLs")
added checks to avoid enabling PLLs that have already been enabled by
the bootloader. However, the PLL_E configuration inherited from the
bootloader isn't necessarily the one that is needed for the kernel.

This can cause SATA to fail like this:

    [    5.310270] phy phy-sata.6: phy poweron failed --> -110
    [    5.315604] tegra-ahci 70027000.sata: failed to power on AHCI controller: -110
    [    5.323022] tegra-ahci: probe of 70027000.sata failed with error -110

Fix this by always programming the PLL_E. This ensures that any mis-
configuration by the bootloader will be overwritten by the kernel.
