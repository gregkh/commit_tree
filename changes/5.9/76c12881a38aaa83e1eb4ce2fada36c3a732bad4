nsproxy: support CLONE_NEWTIME with setns()

So far setns() was missing time namespace support. This was partially due
to it simply not being implemented but also because vdso_join_timens()
could still fail which made switching to multiple namespaces atomically
problematic. This is now fixed so support CLONE_NEWTIME with setns()
