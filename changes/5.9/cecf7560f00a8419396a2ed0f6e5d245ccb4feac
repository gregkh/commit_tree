hwmon: (applesmc) check status earlier.

clang static analysis reports this representative problem

applesmc.c:758:10: warning: 1st function call argument is an
  uninitialized value
        left = be16_to_cpu(*(__be16 *)(buffer + 6)) >> 2;
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

buffer is filled by the earlier call

	ret = applesmc_read_key(LIGHT_SENSOR_LEFT_KEY, ...

This problem is reported because a goto skips the status check.
Other similar problems use data from applesmc_read_key before checking
the status.  So move the checks to before the use.
