MAINTAINERS: enlist Greg formally for console stuff

I did a few greps for main console data structures, and there's a few
places outside of drivers/video/console:
- a braille driver
- a sisusbvga driver
- fbcon, but I think that's fine if we leave that officially under
  fbdev maintainership
- lots of stuff in drivers/tty/vt, which is already under Greg's
  maintainership.

So I think this match gives reasonably useful Cc: lists for the files
and places I've tested.
