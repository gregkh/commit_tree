mm, slab/slub: improve error reporting and overhead of cache_from_obj()

cache_from_obj() was added by commit b9ce5ef49f00 ("sl[au]b: always get
the cache from its page in kmem_cache_free()") to support kmemcg, where
per-memcg cache can be different from the root one, so we can't use the
kmem_cache pointer given to kmem_cache_free().

Prior to that commit, SLUB already had debugging check+warning that could
be enabled to compare the given kmem_cache pointer to one referenced by
the slab page where the object-to-be-freed resides.  This check was moved
to cache_from_obj().  Later the check was also enabled for
SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED configs by commit 598a0717a816 ("mm/slab: validate
cache membership under freelist hardening").

These checks and warnings can be useful especially for the debugging,
which can be improved.  Commit 598a0717a816 changed the pr_err() with
WARN_ON_ONCE() to WARN_ONCE() so only the first hit is now reported,
others are silent.  This patch changes it to WARN() so that all errors are
reported.

It's also useful to print SLUB allocation/free tracking info for the
offending object, if tracking is enabled.  Thus, export the SLUB
print_tracking() function and provide an empty one for SLAB.

For SLUB we can also benefit from the static key check in
kmem_cache_debug_flags(), but we need to move this function to slab.h and
declare the static key there.
