vdpa/mlx5: should keep avail_index despite device status

A VM with mlx5 vDPA has below warnings while being reset:

vhost VQ 0 ring restore failed: -1: Resource temporarily unavailable (11)
vhost VQ 1 ring restore failed: -1: Resource temporarily unavailable (11)

We should allow userspace emulating the virtio device be
able to get to vq's avail_index, regardless of vDPA device
status. Save the index that was last seen when virtq was
stopped, so that userspace doesn't complain.
