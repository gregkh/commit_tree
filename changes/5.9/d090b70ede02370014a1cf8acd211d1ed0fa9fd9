driver core: add deferring probe reason to devices_deferred property

/sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred property contains list of deferred devices.
This list does not contain reason why the driver deferred probe, the patch
improves it.
The natural place to set the reason is dev_err_probe function introduced
recently, ie. if dev_err_probe will be called with -EPROBE_DEFER instead of
printk the message will be attached to a deferred device and printed when user
reads devices_deferred property.
