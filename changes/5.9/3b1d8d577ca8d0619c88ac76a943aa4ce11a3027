thunderbolt: Implement USB3 bandwidth negotiation routines

Each host router USB3 downstream adapter has a set of registers that are
used to negotiate bandwidth between the connection manager and the
internal xHCI controller. These registers allow dynamic bandwidth
management for USB3 isochronous traffic based on what is actually
consumed vs. allocated at any given time.

Implement these USB3 bandwidth negotiation routines to allow the
software connection manager take advantage of these.
