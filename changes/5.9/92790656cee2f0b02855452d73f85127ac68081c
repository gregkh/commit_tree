media: ti-vpe: cal: Store struct device in cal_dev

The cal_dev structure stores the platform_device pointer, but most
accesses to that field need the device pointer. Store the struct device
pointer directly to simplify the code, and use to_platform_device() in
the two locations that need the platform device.
