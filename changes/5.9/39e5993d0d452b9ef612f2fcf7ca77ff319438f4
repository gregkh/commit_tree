ima: Shallow copy the args_p member of ima_rule_entry.lsm elements

The args_p member is a simple string that is allocated by
ima_rule_init(). Shallow copy it like other non-LSM references in
ima_rule_entry structs.

There are no longer any necessary error path cleanups to do in
ima_lsm_copy_rule().
