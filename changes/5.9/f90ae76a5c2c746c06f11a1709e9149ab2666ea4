btrfs: raid56: remove redundant device check in rbio_add_io_page

The merging logic is always executed if the current stripe's device
is not missing. So there's no point in duplicating the check. Simply
remove it, while at it reduce the scope of the 'last_end' variable.
If the current stripe's device is missing we fail the stripe early on.
