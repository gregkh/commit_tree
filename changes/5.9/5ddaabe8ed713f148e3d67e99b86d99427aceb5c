nvme: refactor command completion

Lift all the code to decide the dispostition of a completed command
from nvme_complete_rq and nvme_failover_req into a new helper, which
returns an emum of the potential actions.  nvme_complete_rq then
just switches on those and calls the proper helper for the action.
