ASoC: rk3399_gru_sound: Add DAPM pins, kcontrols for jack detection

PulseAudio (and perhaps other userspace utilities) can not detect any
jack for rk3399_gru_sound as the driver doesn't expose related Jack
kcontrols.

This patch adds two DAPM pins to the headset jack, where the
snd_soc_card_jack_new() call automatically creates "Headphones Jack" and
"Headset Mic Jack" kcontrols from them.

With an appropriate ALSA UCM config specifying JackControl fields for
the "Headphones" and "Headset" (mic) devices, PulseAudio can detect
plug/unplug events for both of them after this patch.
