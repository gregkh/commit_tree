mt76: mt7615: reduce maximum VHT MPDU length to 7991

After fixing mac80211 to allow larger A-MSDUs in some cases, there have been
reports of performance regressions and packet loss with some clients.
It appears that the issue occurs when the hardware is transmitting A-MSDUs
bigger than 8k. Limit the local VHT MPDU size capability to 7991, matching
the value used for MT7915 as well.
