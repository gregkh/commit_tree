scsi: lpfc: Add blk_io_poll support for latency improvment

Although the existing implementation is very good at high I/O load, on
tests involving light load, especially on only a few hardware queues,
latency was a little higher than it can be due to using workqueue
scheduling. Other tasks in the system can delay handling.

Change the lower level to use irq_poll by default which uses a softirq for
I/O completion. This gives better latency as variance in when the cq is
processed is reduced over the workqueue interface. However, as high load is
better served by not being in softirq when the CPU is loaded, work queues
are still used under high I/O load.
