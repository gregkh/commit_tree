ftrace: Move RCU is watching check after recursion check

The first thing that the ftrace function callback helper functions should do
is to check for recursion. Peter Zijlstra found that when
"rcu_is_watching()" had its notrace removed, it caused perf function tracing
to crash. This is because the call of rcu_is_watching() is tested before
function recursion is checked and and if it is traced, it will cause an
infinite recursion loop.

rcu_is_watching() should still stay notrace, but to prevent this should
never had crashed in the first place. The recursion prevention must be the
first thing done in callback functions.
