opp: Don't drop reference for an OPP table that was never parsed

dev_pm_opp_remove_table() should drop a reference to the OPP table only
if the DT OPP table was parsed earlier with a call to
dev_pm_opp_of_add_table() earlier. Else it may end up dropping the
reference to the OPP table, which was added as a result of other calls
like dev_pm_opp_set_clkname(). And would hence result in undesirable
behavior later on when caller would try to free the resource again.
