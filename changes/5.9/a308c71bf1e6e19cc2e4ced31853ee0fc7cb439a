mm/gup: Remove enfornced COW mechanism

With the more strict (but greatly simplified) page reuse logic in
do_wp_page(), we can safely go back to the world where cow is not
enforced with writes.

This essentially reverts commit 17839856fd58 ("gup: document and work
around 'COW can break either way' issue").  There are some context
differences due to some changes later on around it:

  2170ecfa7688 ("drm/i915: convert get_user_pages() --> pin_user_pages()", 2020-06-03)
  376a34efa4ee ("mm/gup: refactor and de-duplicate gup_fast() code", 2020-06-03)

Some lines moved back and forth with those, but this revert patch should
have striped out and covered all the enforced cow bits anyways.
