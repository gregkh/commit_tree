iio:adc:ti-tlc4541: Drop CONFIG_OF and of_match_ptr protections.

These stop us using ACPI PRP0001 to instantiate the device.
I am slowly clearly out use of these in IIO to avoid this being coppied
into new drivers.

Here I also included mod_devicetable.h as we are using of_match_id
which is defined in there and hence it is best practice to include
it directly.
