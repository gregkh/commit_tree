iio: dac: ad5592r: fix unbalanced mutex unlocks in ad5592r_read_raw()

There are 2 exit paths where the lock isn't held, but try to unlock the
mutex when exiting. In these places we should just return from the
function.

A neater approach would be to cleanup the ad5592r_read_raw(), but that
would make this patch more difficult to backport to stable versions.
