btrfs: avoid possible signal interruption of btrfs_drop_snapshot() on relocation tree

[BUG]
There is a bug report about bad signal timing could lead to read-only
fs during balance:

  BTRFS info (device xvdb): balance: start -d -m -s
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): relocating block group 73001861120 flags metadata
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): found 12236 extents, stage: move data extents
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): relocating block group 71928119296 flags data
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): found 3 extents, stage: move data extents
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): found 3 extents, stage: update data pointers
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): relocating block group 60922265600 flags metadata
  BTRFS: error (device xvdb) in btrfs_drop_snapshot:5505: errno=-4 unknown
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): forced readonly
  BTRFS info (device xvdb): balance: ended with status: -4

[CAUSE]
The direct cause is the -EINTR from the following call chain when a
fatal signal is pending:

 relocate_block_group()
 |- clean_dirty_subvols()
    |- btrfs_drop_snapshot()
       |- btrfs_start_transaction()
          |- btrfs_delayed_refs_rsv_refill()
             |- btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes()
                |- __reserve_metadata_bytes()
                   |- wait_reserve_ticket()
                      |- prepare_to_wait_event();
                      |- ticket->error = -EINTR;

Normally this behavior is fine for most btrfs_start_transaction()
callers, as they need to catch any other error, same for the signal, and
exit ASAP.

However for balance, especially for the clean_dirty_subvols() case, we're
already doing cleanup works, getting -EINTR from btrfs_drop_snapshot()
could cause a lot of unexpected problems.

From the mentioned forced read-only report, to later balance error due
to half dropped reloc trees.

[FIX]
Fix this problem by using btrfs_join_transaction() if
btrfs_drop_snapshot() is called from relocation context.

Since btrfs_join_transaction() won't get interrupted by signal, we can
continue the cleanup.
