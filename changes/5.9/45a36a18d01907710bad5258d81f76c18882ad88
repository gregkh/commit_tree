xfrmi: drop ignore_df check before updating pmtu

xfrm interfaces currently test for !skb->ignore_df when deciding
whether to update the pmtu on the skb's dst. Because of this, no pmtu
exception is created when we do something like:

    ping -s 1438 <dest>

By dropping this check, the pmtu exception will be created and the
next ping attempt will work.
