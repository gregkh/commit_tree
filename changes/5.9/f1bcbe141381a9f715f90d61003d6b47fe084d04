vt: make tc write more obvious in vc_con_write_normal

Nested ternary operators spread over 4 lines are really evil for
reading. Turn the outer one to proper 'if'. Now, we see, there is a
common path, so the code can be simplified. This way, the code is
understandable now.

Checked using symbolic execution (klee), that the old and new behaviors
are the same.
