kasan: remove kasan_unpoison_stack_above_sp_to()

kasan_unpoison_stack_above_sp_to() is defined in kasan code but never
used.  The function was introduced as part of the commit:

   commit 9f7d416c36124667 ("kprobes: Unpoison stack in jprobe_return() for KASAN")

... where it was necessary because x86's jprobe_return() would leave
stale shadow on the stack, and was an oddity in that regard.

Since then, jprobes were removed entirely, and as of commit:

  commit 80006dbee674f9fa ("kprobes/x86: Remove jprobe implementation")

... there have been no callers of this function.

Remove the declaration and the implementation.
