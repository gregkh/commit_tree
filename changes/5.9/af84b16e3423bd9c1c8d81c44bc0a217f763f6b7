openrisc: uaccess: Use static inline function in access_ok

As suggested by Linus when reviewing commit 9cb2feb4d21d
("arch/openrisc: Fix issues with access_ok()") last year; making
__range_ok an inline function also fixes the used twice issue that the
commit was fixing.  I agree it's a good cleanup.  This patch addresses
that as I am currently working on the access_ok macro to fixup sparse
annotations in OpenRISC.
