rcu/tree: Repeat the monitor if any free channel is busy

It is possible that one of the channels cannot be detached
because its free channel is busy and previously queued data
has not been processed yet. On the other hand, another
channel can be successfully detached causing the monitor
work to stop.

Prevent that by rescheduling the monitor work if there are
any channels in the pending state after a detach attempt.
