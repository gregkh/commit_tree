block: improve discard bio alignment in __blkdev_issue_discard()

This patch improves discard bio split for address and size alignment in
__blkdev_issue_discard(). The aligned discard bio may help underlying
device controller to perform better discard and internal garbage
collection, and avoid unnecessary internal fragment.

Current discard bio split algorithm in __blkdev_issue_discard() may have
non-discarded fregment on device even the discard bio LBA and size are
both aligned to device's discard granularity size.

Here is the example steps on how to reproduce the above problem.
- On a VMWare ESXi 6.5 update3 installation, create a 51GB virtual disk
  with thin mode and give it to a Linux virtual machine.
- Inside the Linux virtual machine, if the 50GB virtual disk shows up as
  /dev/sdb, fill data into the first 50GB by,
        # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 count=13107200
- Discard the 50GB range from offset 0 on /dev/sdb,
        # blkdiscard /dev/sdb -o 0 -l 53687091200
- Observe the underlying mapping status of the device
        # sg_get_lba_status /dev/sdb -m 1048 --lba=0

Although the discard bio starts at LBA 0 and has 50<<30 bytes size which
are perfect aligned to the discard granularity, from the above list
these are many 1MB (2048 sectors) internal fragments exist unexpectedly.

The problem is in __blkdev_issue_discard(), an improper algorithm causes
an improper bio size which is not aligned.

 25 int __blkdev_issue_discard(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t sector,
 26                 sector_t nr_sects, gfp_t gfp_mask, int flags,
 27                 struct bio **biop)
 28 {
 29         struct request_queue *q = bdev_get_queue(bdev);
   [snipped]
 56
 57         while (nr_sects) {
 58                 sector_t req_sects = min_t(sector_t, nr_sects,
 59                                 bio_allowed_max_sectors(q));
 60
 61                 WARN_ON_ONCE((req_sects << 9) > UINT_MAX);
 62
 63                 bio = blk_next_bio(bio, 0, gfp_mask);
 64                 bio->bi_iter.bi_sector = sector;
 65                 bio_set_dev(bio, bdev);
 66                 bio_set_op_attrs(bio, op, 0);
 67
 68                 bio->bi_iter.bi_size = req_sects << 9;
 69                 sector += req_sects;
 70                 nr_sects -= req_sects;
   [snipped]
 79         }
 80
 81         *biop = bio;
 82         return 0;
 83 }
 84 EXPORT_SYMBOL(__blkdev_issue_discard);

At line 58-59, to discard a 50GB range, req_sects is set as return value
of bio_allowed_max_sectors(q), which is 8388607 sectors. In the above
case, the discard granularity is 2048 sectors, although the start LBA
and discard length are aligned to discard granularity, req_sects never
has chance to be aligned to discard granularity. This is why there are
some still-mapped 2048 sectors fragment in every 4 or 8 GB range.

If req_sects at line 58 is set to a value aligned to discard_granularity
and close to UNIT_MAX, then all consequent split bios inside device
driver are (almostly) aligned to discard_granularity of the device
queue. The 2048 sectors still-mapped fragment will disappear.

This patch introduces bio_aligned_discard_max_sectors() to return the
the value which is aligned to q->limits.discard_granularity and closest
to UINT_MAX. Then this patch replaces bio_allowed_max_sectors() with
this new routine to decide a more proper split bio length.

But we still need to handle the situation when discard start LBA is not
aligned to q->limits.discard_granularity, otherwise even the length is
aligned, current code may still leave 2048 fragment around every 4GB
range. Therefore, to calculate req_sects, firstly the start LBA of
discard range is checked (including partition offset), if it is not
aligned to discard granularity, the first split location should make
sure following bio has bi_sector aligned to discard granularity. Then
there won't be still-mapped fragment in the middle of the discard range.

The above is how this patch improves discard bio alignment in
__blkdev_issue_discard(). Now with this patch, after discard with same
command line mentiond previously, sg_get_lba_status returns,
descriptor LBA: 0x0000000000000000  blocks: 106954752  deallocated
descriptor LBA: 0x0000000006600000  blocks: 0  deallocated

We an see there is no 2048 sectors segment anymore, everything is clean.
