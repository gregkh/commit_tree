fsnotify: fold fsnotify() call into fsnotify_parent()

All (two) callers of fsnotify_parent() also call fsnotify() to notify
the child inode. Move the second fsnotify() call into fsnotify_parent().

This will allow more flexibility in making decisions about which of the
two event falvors should be sent.

Using 'goto notify_child' in the inline helper seems a bit strange, but
it mimics the code in __fsnotify_parent() for clarity and the goto
pattern will become less strage after following patches are applied.
