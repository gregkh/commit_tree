lwtunnel: only keep the available bits when setting vxlan md->gbp

As we can see from vxlan_build/parse_gbp_hdr(), when processing metadata
on vxlan rx/tx path, only dont_learn/policy_applied/policy_id fields can
be set to or parse from the packet for vxlan gbp option.

So do the mask when set it in lwtunnel, as it does in act_tunnel_key and
cls_flower.
