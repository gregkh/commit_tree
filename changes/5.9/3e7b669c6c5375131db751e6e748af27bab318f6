riscv: Cleanup unnecessary define in asm-offset.c

 - TASK_THREAD_SP is duplicated define
 - TASK_STACK is no use at all
 - Don't worry about thread_info's offset in task_struct, have
   a look on comment in include/linux/sched.h:

struct task_struct {
	/*
	 * For reasons of header soup (see current_thread_info()), this
	 * must be the first element of task_struct.
	 */
	struct thread_info		thread_info;
