drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Make skb->protocol consistent with the header

This driver is a virtual driver stacked on top of Ethernet interfaces.

When this driver transmits data on the Ethernet device, the skb->protocol
setting is inconsistent with the Ethernet header prepended to the skb.

This causes a user listening on the Ethernet interface with an AF_PACKET
socket, to see different sll_protocol values for incoming and outgoing
frames, because incoming frames would have this value set by parsing the
Ethernet header.

This patch changes the skb->protocol value for outgoing Ethernet frames,
making it consistent with the Ethernet header prepended. This makes a
user listening on the Ethernet device with an AF_PACKET socket, to see
the same sll_protocol value for incoming and outgoing frames.
