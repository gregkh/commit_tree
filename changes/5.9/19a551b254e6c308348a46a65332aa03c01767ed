powerpc/papr_scm: Make some symbols static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/papr_scm.c:97:1: warning:
 symbol 'papr_nd_regions' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/papr_scm.c:98:1: warning:
 symbol 'papr_ndr_lock' was not declared. Should it be static?

Those variables are not used outside of papr_scm.c, so this
commit marks them static.
