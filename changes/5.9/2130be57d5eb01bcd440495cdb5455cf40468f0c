spi: spi-sun6i: sun6i_spi_transfer_one(): remove not needed masking of transfer length

In sun6i_spi_transfer_one() the driver ensures that the length of the transfer
is smaller or equal to SUN6I_MAX_XFER_SIZE. This means the masking of the
length to SUN6I_MAX_XFER_SIZE can be skipped when writing the transfer length
into the registers.

This patch removes the useless masking of the transfer length to
SUN6I_MAX_XFER_SIZE.
