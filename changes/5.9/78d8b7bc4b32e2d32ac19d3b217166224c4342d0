mptcp: subflow: split subflow_init_req

When syncookie support is added, we will need to add a variant of
subflow_init_req() helper.  It will do almost same thing except
that it will not compute/add a token to the mptcp token tree.

To avoid excess copy&paste, this commit splits away part of the
code into a new helper, __subflow_init_req, that can then be re-used
from the 'no insert' function added in a followup change.
