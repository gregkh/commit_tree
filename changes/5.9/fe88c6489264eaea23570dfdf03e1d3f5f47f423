serial: core: fix port-lock initialisation

Commit f743061a85f5 ("serial: core: Initialise spin lock before use in
uart_configure_port()") tried to work around a breakage introduced by
commit a3cb39d258ef ("serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial
device for console") by adding a second initialisation of the port lock
when registering the port.

As reported by the build robots [1], this doesn't really solve the
regression introduced by the console-detach changes and also adds a
second redundant initialisation of the lock for normal ports.

Start cleaning up this mess by removing the redundant initialisation and
making sure that the port lock is again initialised once-only for ports
that aren't already in use as a console.
