ALSA; firewire-tascam: exclude Tascam FE-8 from detection

Tascam FE-8 is known to support communication by asynchronous transaction
only. The support can be implemented in userspace application and
snd-firewire-ctl-services project has the support. However, ALSA
firewire-tascam driver is bound to the model.

This commit changes device entries so that the model is excluded. In a
commit 53b3ffee7885 ("ALSA: firewire-tascam: change device probing
processing"), I addressed to the concern that version field in
configuration differs depending on installed firmware. However, as long
as I checked, the version number is fixed. It's safe to return version
number back to modalias.
