gpio: pca953x: Survive spurious interrupts

The pca953x driver never checks the result of irq_find_mapping(),
which returns 0 when no mapping is found. When a spurious interrupt
is delivered (which can happen under obscure circumstances), the
kernel explodes as it still tries to handle the error code as
a real interrupt.

Handle this particular case and warn on spurious interrupts.
