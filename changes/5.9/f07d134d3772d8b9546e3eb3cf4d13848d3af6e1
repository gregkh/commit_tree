ice: fix the vsi_id mask to be 10 bit for set_rss_lut

set_rss_lut can fail due to incorrect vsi_id mask. vsi_id is 10 bit
but mask was 0x1FF whereas it should be 0x3FF.

For vsi_num >= 512, FW set_rss_lut can fail with return code
EACCESS (VSI ownership issue) because software was providing
incorrect vsi_num (dropping 10th bit due to incorrect mask) for
set_rss_lut admin command
