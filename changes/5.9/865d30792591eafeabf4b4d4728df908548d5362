coresight: tmc: Add shutdown callback for TMC ETR

Implement a shutdown callback to ensure ETR hardware is
properly shutdown in reboot/shutdown path. This is required
for ETR which has SMMU address translation enabled like on
SC7180 SoC and few others. If the hardware is still accessing
memory after SMMU translation is disabled as part of SMMU
shutdown callback in system reboot or shutdown path, then
IOVAs(I/O virtual address) which it was using will go on the
bus as the physical addresses which might result in unknown
crashes (NoC/interconnect errors). So we make sure from this
shutdown callback that the ETR is shutdown before SMMU translation
is disabled and device_link in SMMU driver will take care of
ordering of shutdown callbacks such that SMMU shutdown callback
is not called before any of its consumer shutdown callbacks.
