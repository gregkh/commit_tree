drm/amd/display: Don't compare dppclk before updating DTO

[Why]
In dcn3_update_clocks there are situations where dppclk is not
lowered (i.e. stays the same), but DTO still needs to be increased
before we program pipe frontend (i.e. in prepare_bandwidth). If we
don't program the new DTO value before we program the pipe,
we will underflow as soon as the pipe lock is released until the
next call to dcn3_update_clocks where the DTO is updated.

[How]
Remove dppclk check before programming new DTO value.
