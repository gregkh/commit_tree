dpaa2-eth: fix command version for Tx shaping

When adding the support for TBF offload, the improper command version
was added even though the command format is for the V2 of
dpni_set_tx_shaping(). This does not affect the functionality of TBF
since the only change between these two versions is the addition of the
exceeded parameters which are not used in TBF. Still, fix the bug so
that we keep things in sync.
