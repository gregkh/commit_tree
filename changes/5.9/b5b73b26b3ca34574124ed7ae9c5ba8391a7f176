taprio: Fix allowing too small intervals

It's possible that the user specifies an interval that couldn't allow
any packet to be transmitted. This also avoids the issue of the
hrtimer handler starving the other threads because it's running too
often.

The solution is to reject interval sizes that according to the current
link speed wouldn't allow any packet to be transmitted.
