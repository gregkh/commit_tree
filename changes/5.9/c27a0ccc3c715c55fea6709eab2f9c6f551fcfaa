cpufreq: intel_pstate: Update cached EPP in the active mode

Make intel_pstate update the cached EPP value when setting the EPP
via sysfs in the active mode just like it is the case in the passive
mode, for consistency, but also for the benefit of subsequent
changes.

No intentional functional impact.
