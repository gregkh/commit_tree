drm/amdgpu/smu11: drop code chuck that got accidently re-added

Seems to be due to a bad merge.  Code was originally added in
commit 5aaa8fff3aa950 ("drm/amd/powerplay: unload mp1 for Arcturus RAS baco reset")
but later removed in commit 7f70443fd83407 ("drm/amdgpu: set mp1 state before reload").
but is back again.
