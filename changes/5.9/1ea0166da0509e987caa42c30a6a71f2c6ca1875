octeontx2-pf: Fix the device state on error

Currently in otx2_open on failure of nix_lf_start
transmit queues are not stopped which are already
started in link_event. Since the tx queues are not
stopped network stack still try's to send the packets
leading to driver crash while access the device resources.
