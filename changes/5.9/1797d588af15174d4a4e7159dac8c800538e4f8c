platform/x86: asus-wmi: Fix SW_TABLET_MODE always reporting 1 on many different models

Commit b0dbd97de1f1 ("platform/x86: asus-wmi: Add support for
SW_TABLET_MODE") added support for reporting SW_TABLET_MODE using the
Asus 0x00120063 WMI-device-id to see if various transformer models were
docked into their keyboard-dock (SW_TABLET_MODE=0) or if they were
being used as a tablet.

The new SW_TABLET_MODE support (naively?) assumed that non Transformer
devices would either not support the 0x00120063 WMI-device-id at all,
or would NOT set ASUS_WMI_DSTS_PRESENCE_BIT in their reply when querying
the device-id.

Unfortunately this is not true and we have received many bug reports about
this change causing the asus-wmi driver to always report SW_TABLET_MODE=1
on non Transformer devices. This causes libinput to think that these are
360 degree hinges style 2-in-1s folded into tablet-mode. Making libinput
suppress keyboard and touchpad events from the builtin keyboard and
touchpad. So effectively this causes the keyboard and touchpad to not work
on many non Transformer Asus models.

This commit fixes this by using the existing DMI based quirk mechanism in
asus-nb-wmi.c to allow using the 0x00120063 device-id for reporting
SW_TABLET_MODE on Transformer models and ignoring it on all other models.
