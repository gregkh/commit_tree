opp: Enable resources again if they were disabled earlier

dev_pm_opp_set_rate() can now be called with freq = 0 in order
to either drop performance or bandwidth votes or to disable
regulators on platforms which support them.

In such cases, a subsequent call to dev_pm_opp_set_rate() with
the same frequency ends up returning early because 'old_freq == freq'

Instead make it fall through and put back the dropped performance
and bandwidth votes and/or enable back the regulators.
