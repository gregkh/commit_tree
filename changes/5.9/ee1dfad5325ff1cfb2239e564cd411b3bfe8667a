dm: fix bio splitting and its bio completion order for regular IO

dm_queue_split() is removed because __split_and_process_bio() _must_
handle splitting bios to ensure proper bio submission and completion
ordering as a bio is split.

Otherwise, multiple recursive calls to ->submit_bio will cause multiple
split bios to be allocated from the same ->bio_split mempool at the same
time. This would result in deadlock in low memory conditions because no
progress could be made (only one bio is available in ->bio_split
mempool).

This fix has been verified to still fix the loss of performance, due
to excess splitting, that commit 120c9257f5f1 provided.

Fixes: 120c9257f5f1 ("Revert "dm: always call blk_queue_split() in dm_process_bio()"")
