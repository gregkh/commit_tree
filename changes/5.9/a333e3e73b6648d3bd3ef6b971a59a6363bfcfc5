mm: migration of hugetlbfs page skip memcg

hugetlbfs pages do not participate in memcg: so although they do find most
of migrate_page_states() useful, it would be better if they did not call
into mem_cgroup_migrate() - where Qian Cai reported that LTP's
move_pages12 triggers the warning in Alex Shi's prospective commit
"mm/memcg: warning on !memcg after readahead page charged".
