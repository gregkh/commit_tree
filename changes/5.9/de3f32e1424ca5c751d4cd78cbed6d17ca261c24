doc, mm: sync up oom_score_adj documentation

There are at least two notes in the oom section.  The 3% discount for root
processes is gone since d46078b28889 ("mm, oom: remove 3% bonus for
CAP_SYS_ADMIN processes").

Likewise children of the selected oom victim are not sacrificed since
bbbe48029720 ("mm, oom: remove 'prefer children over parent' heuristic")

Drop both of them.
