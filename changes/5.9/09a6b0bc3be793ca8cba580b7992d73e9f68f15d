random32: Restore __latent_entropy attribute on net_rand_state

Commit f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt
and activity") broke compilation and was temporarily fixed by Linus in
83bdc7275e62 ("random32: remove net_rand_state from the latent entropy
gcc plugin") by entirely moving net_rand_state out of the things handled
by the latent_entropy GCC plugin.

From what I understand when reading the plugin code, using the
__latent_entropy attribute on a declaration was the wrong part and
simply keeping the __latent_entropy attribute on the variable definition
was the correct fix.
