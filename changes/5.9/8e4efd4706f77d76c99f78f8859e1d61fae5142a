net: dsa: mt7530: Add of_node_put() before break and return statements

Every iteration of for_each_child_of_node() decrements
the reference count of the previous node, however when control
is transferred from the middle of the loop, as in the case of
a return or break or goto, there is no decrement thus ultimately
resulting in a memory leak.

Fix a potential memory leak in mt7530.c by inserting of_node_put()
before the break and return statements.

Issue found with Coccinelle.
