btrfs: move btrfs_scratch_superblocks into btrfs_dev_replace_finishing

We need to move the closing of the src_device out of all the device
replace locking, but we definitely want to zero out the superblock
before we commit the last time to make sure the device is properly
removed.  Handle this by pushing btrfs_scratch_superblocks into
btrfs_dev_replace_finishing, and then later on we'll move the src_device
closing and freeing stuff where we need it to be.
