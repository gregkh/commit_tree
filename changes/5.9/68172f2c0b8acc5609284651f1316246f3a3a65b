drm/i915: Pull printing GT capabilities on error to err_print_gt

We try not to assume that we captured any information, and so have to
check that error->gt exists before reporting. This check was missed in
err_print_capabilities, so lets break up the capability info and push it
into the GT dump.

We are still a long way from yamlifying this output!
