i2c: i801: Exclude device from suspend direct complete optimization

By default, PCI drivers with runtime PM enabled will skip the calls
to suspend and resume on system PM. For this driver, we don't want
that, as we need to perform additional steps for system PM to work
properly on all systems. So instruct the PM core to not skip these
calls.
