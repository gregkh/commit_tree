PM / devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Fix kernel oops when rockchip,pmu is absent

Booting a recent kernel on a rk3399-based system (nanopc-t4),
equipped with a recent u-boot and ATF results in an Oops due
to a NULL pointer dereference.

This turns out to be due to the rk3399-dmc driver looking for
an *undocumented* property (rockchip,pmu), and happily using
a NULL pointer when the property isn't there.

Instead, make most of what was brought in with 9173c5ceb035
("PM / devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Pass ODT and auto power down parameters
to TF-A.") conditioned on finding this property in the device-tree,
preventing the driver from exploding.
