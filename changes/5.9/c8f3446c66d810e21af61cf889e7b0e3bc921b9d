inotify: report both events on parent and child with single callback

fsnotify usually calls inotify_handle_event() once for watching parent
to report event with child's name and once for watching child to report
event without child's name.

Do the same thing with a single callback instead of two callbacks when
marks iterator contains both inode and child entries.
