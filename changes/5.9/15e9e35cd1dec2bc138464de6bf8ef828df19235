KVM: MIPS: Change the definition of kvm type

MIPS defines two kvm types:

 #define KVM_VM_MIPS_TE          0
 #define KVM_VM_MIPS_VZ          1

In Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst it is said that "You probably want to
use 0 as machine type", which implies that type 0 be the "automatic" or
"default" type. And, in user-space libvirt use the null-machine (with
type 0) to detect the kvm capability, which returns "KVM not supported"
on a VZ platform.

I try to fix it in QEMU but it is ugly:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-08/msg05629.html

And Thomas Huth suggests me to change the definition of kvm type:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg03281.html

So I define like this:

 #define KVM_VM_MIPS_AUTO        0
 #define KVM_VM_MIPS_VZ          1
 #define KVM_VM_MIPS_TE          2

Since VZ and TE cannot co-exists, using type 0 on a TE platform will
still return success (so old user-space tools have no problems on new
kernels); the advantage is that using type 0 on a VZ platform will not
return failure. So, the only problem is "new user-space tools use type
2 on old kernels", but if we treat this as a kernel bug, we can backport
this patch to old stable kernels.
