x86/entry: Fix AC assertion

The WARN added in commit 3c73b81a9164 ("x86/entry, selftests: Further
improve user entry sanity checks") unconditionally triggers on a IVB
machine because it does not support SMAP.

For !SMAP hardware the CLAC/STAC instructions are patched out and thus if
userspace sets AC, it is still have set after entry.
