torture: Add kvm-tranform.sh script for qemu-cmd files

This commit adds a script that transforms qemu-cmd files to allow them
and the corresponding kernels to be run in contexts other than the one
that they were created for, including on systems other than the one that
they were built on.  For example, this allows the build products from a
--buildonly run to be transformed to allow distributed rcutorture testing.
