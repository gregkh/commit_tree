gpio: aspeed: fix ast2600 bank properties

GPIO_U is mapped to the least significant byte of input/output mask, and
the byte in "output" mask should be 0 because GPIO_U is input only. All
the other bits need to be 1 because GPIO_V/W/X support both input and
output modes.

Similarly, GPIO_Y/Z are mapped to the 2 least significant bytes, and the
according bits need to be 1 because GPIO_Y/Z support both input and
output modes.
