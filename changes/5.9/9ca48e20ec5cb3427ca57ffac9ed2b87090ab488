fs/fs-writeback.c: adjust dirtytime_interval_handler definition to match prototype

Commit 32927393dc1c ("sysctl: pass kernel pointers to ->proc_handler")
changed ctl_table.proc_handler to take a kernel pointer.  Adjust the
definition of dirtytime_interval_handler to match its prototype in
linux/writeback.h which fixes the following sparse error/warning:

fs/fs-writeback.c:2189:50: warning: incorrect type in argument 3 (different address spaces)
fs/fs-writeback.c:2189:50:    expected void *
fs/fs-writeback.c:2189:50:    got void [noderef] __user *buffer
fs/fs-writeback.c:2184:5: error: symbol 'dirtytime_interval_handler' redeclared with different type (incompatible argument 3 (different address spaces)):
fs/fs-writeback.c:2184:5:    int extern [addressable] [signed] [toplevel] dirtytime_interval_handler( ... )
fs/fs-writeback.c: note: in included file:
./include/linux/writeback.h:374:5: note: previously declared as:
./include/linux/writeback.h:374:5:    int extern [addressable] [signed] [toplevel] dirtytime_interval_handler( ... )
