mtd: spi-nor: spansion: Remove s70fl01gs from flash_info

The s70fl01gs is a dual die stack of two s25fl512s die with dedicated chip
select pins to each. Tested with the device and confirmed that is working
as two s25fl512s devices. The current device ID in the flash_info table
matches with s70fs01gs which does not work with current MTD (s70fs01gs
does not support RDSR(05h) which is critical for erase/write).
