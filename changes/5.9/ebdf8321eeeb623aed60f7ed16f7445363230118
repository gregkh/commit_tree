mm/migrate: fixup setting UFFD_WP flag

Commit f45ec5ff16a75 ("userfaultfd: wp: support swap and page migration")
introduced support for tracking the uffd wp bit during page migration.
However the non-swap PTE variant was used to set the flag for zone device
private pages which are a type of swap page.

This leads to corruption of the swap offset if the original PTE has the
uffd_wp flag set.
