block: remove unused BLK_QC_T_EAGAIN flag

commit 7b6620d7db56 ("block: remove REQ_NOWAIT_INLINE") removed the
REQ_NOWAIT_INLINE related code, but the diff wasn't applied to
blk_types.h somehow.

Then commit 2771cefeac49 ("block: remove the REQ_NOWAIT_INLINE flag")
removed the REQ_NOWAIT_INLINE flag while the BLK_QC_T_EAGAIN flag still
remains.
