mwifiex: Increase AES key storage size to 256 bits

Following commit e18696786548 ("mwifiex: Prevent memory corruption
handling keys") the mwifiex driver fails to authenticate with certain
networks, specifically networks with 256 bit keys, and repeatedly asks
for the password. The kernel log repeats the following lines (id and
bssid redacted):

    mwifiex_pcie 0000:01:00.0: info: trying to associate to '<id>' bssid <bssid>
    mwifiex_pcie 0000:01:00.0: info: associated to bssid <bssid> successfully
    mwifiex_pcie 0000:01:00.0: crypto keys added
    mwifiex_pcie 0000:01:00.0: info: successfully disconnected from <bssid>: reason code 3

Tracking down this problem lead to the overflow check introduced by the
aforementioned commit into mwifiex_ret_802_11_key_material_v2(). This
check fails on networks with 256 bit keys due to the current storage
size for AES keys in struct mwifiex_aes_param being only 128 bit.

To fix this issue, increase the storage size for AES keys to 256 bit.
