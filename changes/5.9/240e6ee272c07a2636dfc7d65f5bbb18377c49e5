nvme: support for zoned namespaces

Add support for NVM Express Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) Command Set defined
in NVM Express TP4053. Zoned namespaces are discovered based on their
Command Set Identifier reported in the namespaces Namespace
Identification Descriptor list. A successfully discovered Zoned
Namespace will be registered with the block layer as a host managed
zoned block device with Zone Append command support. A namespace that
does not support append is not supported by the driver.
