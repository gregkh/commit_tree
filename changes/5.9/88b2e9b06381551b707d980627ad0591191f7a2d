fs/ufs: avoid potential u32 multiplication overflow

The 64 bit ino is being compared to the product of two u32 values,
however, the multiplication is being performed using a 32 bit multiply so
there is a potential of an overflow.  To be fully safe, cast uspi->s_ncg
to a u64 to ensure a 64 bit multiplication occurs to avoid any chance of
overflow.
