xfrm: Use correct address family in xfrm_state_find

The struct flowi must never be interpreted by itself as its size
depends on the address family.  Therefore it must always be grouped
with its original family value.

In this particular instance, the original family value is lost in
the function xfrm_state_find.  Therefore we get a bogus read when
it's coupled with the wrong family which would occur with inter-
family xfrm states.

This patch fixes it by keeping the original family value.

Note that the same bug could potentially occur in LSM through
the xfrm_state_pol_flow_match hook.  I checked the current code
there and it seems to be safe for now as only secid is used which
is part of struct flowi_common.  But that API should be changed
so that so that we don't get new bugs in the future.  We could
do that by replacing fl with just secid or adding a family field.
