phy: mapphone-mdm6600: Add missing description for some structure fields

We get warning with W=1 build:
drivers/phy/motorola/phy-mapphone-mdm6600.c:185: warning: Function
parameter or member 'val' not described in 'phy_mdm6600_cmd'
drivers/phy/motorola/phy-mapphone-mdm6600.c:200: warning: Function
parameter or member 'work' not described in 'phy_mdm6600_status'

Fix that by adding description for 'val' and 'work'
