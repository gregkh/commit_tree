usb: gadget: udc: mv_udc_core: Remove unused static const variable 'driver_desc'

Looks as though it's never been used.  Driver was introduced in 2014.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/usb/gadget/udc/mv_udc_core.c:56:19: warning: ‘driver_desc’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 56 | static const char driver_desc[] = DRIVER_DESC;
 | ^~~~~~~~~~~
