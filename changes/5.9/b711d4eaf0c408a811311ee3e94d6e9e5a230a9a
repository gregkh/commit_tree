io_uring: find and cancel head link async work on files exit

Commit f254ac04c874 ("io_uring: enable lookup of links holding inflight files")
only handled 2 out of the three head link cases we have, we also need to
lookup and cancel work that is blocked in io-wq if that work has a link
that's holding a reference to the files structure.

Put the "cancel head links that hold this request pending" logic into
io_attempt_cancel(), which will to through the motions of finding and
canceling head links that hold the current inflight files stable request
pending.
