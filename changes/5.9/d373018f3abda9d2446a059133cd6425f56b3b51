media: ti-vpe: cal: Move CAL I/O accessors to cal.h

To prepare for the split of the camerarx code to a separate file, move
the CAL I/O accessors to cal.h. This requires renaming the accessors
with a cal_prefix, as the current names are too generic and prone to
namespace clashes.

The reg_read() and read_write() macros, that cover both CAL and CAMERARX
register access, are split in two groups of inline functions, one for
CAL access and one for CAMERARX access.
