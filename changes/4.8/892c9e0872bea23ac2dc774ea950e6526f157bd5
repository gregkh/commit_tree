fm10k: perform data path reset even when switch is not ready

A while ago, an additional check for the switch being ready was added to
reset_hw. A recent refactor accidentally made this check return an error
code on failure which caused fm10k_probe to fail when the switch wasn't
brought up first. The original reasoning for the check was to prevent
additional data path reset when the fabric wasn't ready yet. However,
there isn't a compelling reason to keep the check, as the data path
reset will restore hardware to a known good state. Remove the check and
perform the data path reset regardless of the switch manager state.

An alternative fix is to return FM10K_SUCCESS instead, and bypass the
actual data path reset. This should be fine as we will perform
a reset_hw once the switch is active. However, since data path reset
will reset many parts of the hardware it seems better to just perform
the reset regardless of switch state.
