tg3: Fix for disallow tx coalescing time to be 0

The recent commit 087d7a8c9174 "tg3: Fix for diasllow rx coalescing
time to be 0" disallow to set Rx coalescing time to be 0 as this stops
generating interrupts for the incoming packets. I found the zero
Tx coalescing time stops generating interrupts for outgoing packets
as well and fires Tx watchdog later. To avoid this, don't allow to set
Tx coalescing time to 0 and also remove subsequent checks that become
senseless.
