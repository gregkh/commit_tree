udp: fix poll() issue with zero sized packets

Laura tracked poll() [and friends] regression caused by commit
e6afc8ace6dd ("udp: remove headers from UDP packets before queueing")

udp_poll() needs to know if there is a valid packet in receive queue,
even if its payload length is 0.

Change first_packet_length() to return an signed int, and use -1
as the indication of an empty queue.
