staging/lustre/osc: glimpse lock should match only with granted locks

A deadlock is possible during ccc_prep_size()->ldlm_lock_match() vs
cl_io_lock() which is waiting for a matched lock and conflicts with
already taken lock before ccc_prep_size().

It is better to send an additional lock request to avoid deadlock.
