netfilter: ebtables: put module reference when an incorrect extension is found

commit bcf493428840 ("netfilter: ebtables: Fix extension lookup with
identical name") added a second lookup in case the extension that was
found during the first lookup matched another extension with the same
name, but didn't release the reference on the incorrect module.
