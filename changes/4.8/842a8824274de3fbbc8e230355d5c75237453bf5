regulator: act8865: Fix missing of_node_put() in act8865_pdata_from_dt()

This node pointer is returned by of_get_child_by_name() with
refcount incremented in this function. of_node_put() is missing
when exitting this function while invalid device type. Fix it
by move of_get_child_by_name() code after device type check.
