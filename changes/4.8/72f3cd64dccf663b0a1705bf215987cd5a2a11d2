device-tree: nexus7: Remove power gpio key entry and use pmic8xxx-pwrkey

Since the pmic8xxx-pwrkey driver is already supported in the
qcom-apq8064.dtsi, and the pmic8xxx-pwrkey supports logic to
configure proper device shutdown when ps_hold goes low, it is
better to use that driver then a generic gpio button.

Thus this patch remove the gpio power key entry here, so we
don't get double input events from having two drivers enabled.
