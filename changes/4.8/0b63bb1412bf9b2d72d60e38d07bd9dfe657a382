drm/i915/guc: index host arrays by i915 engine ID, not guc_id

The ONLY places that guc_id (aka hw_id) should be used are those where
the value or address is determined by and shared with the GuC firmware;
specifically, when filling in the GuC-context-descriptor or the GuC
addon data, or putting an entry in the GuC's work queue.

It need not (and therefore should not) be used to index GuC statistics
or similar host-managed tracking data. In particular, i915_guc_submit()
produces (and debugfs decodes) GuC submission statistics which should be
indexed by driver-engine-id rather then guc-engine-id.
