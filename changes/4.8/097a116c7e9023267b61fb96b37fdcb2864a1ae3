s390/cpuinfo: show dynamic and static cpu mhz

Show the dynamic and static cpu mhz of each cpu. Since these values
are per cpu this requires a fundamental extension of the format of
/proc/cpuinfo.

Historically we had only a single line per cpu and a summary at the
top of the file. This format is hardly extendible if we want to add
more per cpu information.

Therefore this patch adds per cpu blocks at the end of /proc/cpuinfo:

cpu             : 0
cpu Mhz dynamic : 5504
cpu Mhz static  : 5504

cpu             : 1
cpu Mhz dynamic : 5504
cpu Mhz static  : 5504

cpu             : 2
cpu Mhz dynamic : 5504
cpu Mhz static  : 5504

cpu             : 3
cpu Mhz dynamic : 5504
cpu Mhz static  : 5504

Right now each block contains only the dynamic and static cpu mhz,
but it can be easily extended like on every other architecture.

This extension is supposed to be compatible with the old format.
