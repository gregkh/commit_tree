drm/i915: Add output_types bitmask into the crtc state

Rather than looping through encoders to see which encoder types
are being driven by the pipe, add an output_types bitmask into
the crtc state and populate it prior to compute_config and during
state readout.

v2: Determine output_types before .compute_config() hooks are called
