spi: pxa2xx: Switch to SPI core DMA mapping functionality

SPI core provides DMA mapping with scatterlists. Start using it instead
of own implementation in spi-pxa2xx. Major difference in addition to
bunch of removed boilerplate code is that SPI core does
mapping/unmapping for all transfers in a message before and after the
message sending where spi-pxa2xx did mapping/unmapping for each
transfers separately.
