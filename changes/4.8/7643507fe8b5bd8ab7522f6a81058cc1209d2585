netfilter: xt_NFLOG: nflog-range does not truncate packets

li->u.ulog.copy_len is currently ignored by the kernel, we should truncate
the packet to either li->u.ulog.copy_len (if set) or copy_range before
sending it to userspace. 0 is a valid input for copy_len, so add a new
flag to indicate whether this was option was specified by the user or not.

Add two flags to indicate whether nflog-size/copy_len was set or not.
XT_NFLOG_F_COPY_LEN is for XT_NFLOG and NFLOG_F_COPY_LEN for nfnetlink_log

On the userspace side, this was initially represented by the option
nflog-range, this will be replaced by --nflog-size now. --nflog-range would
still exist but does not do anything.
