huge tmpfs: fix Committed_AS leak

Under swapping load on huge tmpfs, /proc/meminfo's Committed_AS grows
bigger and bigger: just a cosmetic issue for most users, but disabling
for those who run without overcommit (/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory 2).

shmem_uncharge() was forgetting to unaccount __vm_enough_memory's
charge, and shmem_charge() was forgetting it on the filesystem-full
error path.
