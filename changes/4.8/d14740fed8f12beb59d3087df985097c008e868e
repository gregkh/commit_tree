MIPS: KVM: Fix fpu.S misassembly with r6

__kvm_save_fpu and __kvm_restore_fpu use .set mips64r2 so that they can
access the odd FPU registers as well as the even, however this causes
misassembly of the return instruction on MIPSr6.

Fix by replacing .set mips64r2 with .set fp=64, which doesn't change the
architecture revision.
