thp: handle file pages in split_huge_pmd()

Splitting THP PMD is simple: just unmap it as in DAX case.  This way we
can avoid memory overhead on page table allocation to deposit.

It's probably a good idea to try to allocation page table with
GFP_ATOMIC in __split_huge_pmd_locked() to avoid refaulting the area,
but clearing pmd should be good enough for now.

Unlike DAX, we also remove the page from rmap and drop reference.
pmd_young() is transfered to PageReferenced().
