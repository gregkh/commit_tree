mlxsw: spectrum: Centralize VLAN-aware bridge ref counting

We hold a reference count on the number of ports member in the
VLAN-aware bridge, as we only support one.

Instead of always incrementing / decrementing the reference count after
joining / leaving the bridge, simply do this accounting in the join /
leave functions.
