fm10k: prevent multiple threads updating statistics

Also prevent updating stats while the interface is down. If we're
already updating stats, just return doing nothing. When we take the
device down, block stat updates until we come back up. This ensures that
we avoid tearing down rings when we're updating statistics, and prevents
updating statistics until we're up.

We can't re-use the __FM10K_DOWN for this because it wouldn't prevent
multiple threads from accessing statistics. Neither does it prevent the
case where we start updating stats and then start going down in another
thread.

The fm10k_get_stats64 is except from this, because it has a completely
different flow which does not suffer from the same issues as
fm10k_update_stats might.
