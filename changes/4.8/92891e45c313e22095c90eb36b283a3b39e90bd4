drm/i915: Use skl_cdclk_decimal() on bxt

Both SKL and BXT need to fill in the "decimal" cdclk frequency into
the CDCLK_CTL register. SKL uses a small helper to do the kHz->"decimal"
conversion, whereas BXT has it open-coded. Use the helper on BXT too.

While at it, change it to round to closest rather than down. It doesn't
actually matter with the frequencies we have to deal with, but it seems
like the right thing to do.
