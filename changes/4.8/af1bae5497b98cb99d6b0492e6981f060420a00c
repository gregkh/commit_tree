KVM: x86: bump KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID to 1023

kzalloc was replaced with kvm_kvzalloc to allow non-contiguous areas and
rcu had to be modified to cope with it.

The practical limit for KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID right now is INT_MAX, but lower
value was chosen in case there were bugs.  1023 is sufficient maximum
APIC ID for 288 VCPUs.
