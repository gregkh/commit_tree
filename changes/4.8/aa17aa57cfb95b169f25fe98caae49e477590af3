s390/mm: add kvm shadow fault function

This patch introduces function kvm_s390_shadow_fault() used to resolve a
fault on a shadow gmap. This function will do validity checking and
build up the shadow page table hierarchy in order to fault in the
requested page into the shadow page table structure.

If an exception occurs while shadowing, guest 2 has to be notified about
it using either an exception or a program interrupt intercept. If
concurrent unshadowing occurres, this function will simply return with
-EAGAIN and the caller has to retry.
