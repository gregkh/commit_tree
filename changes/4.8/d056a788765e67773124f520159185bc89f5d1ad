bpf, maps: extend map_fd_get_ptr arguments

This patch extends map_fd_get_ptr() callback that is used by fd array
maps, so that struct file pointer from the related map can be passed
in. It's safe to remove map_update_elem() callback for the two maps since
this is only allowed from syscall side, but not from eBPF programs for these
two map types. Like in per-cpu map case, bpf_fd_array_map_update_elem()
needs to be called directly here due to the extra argument.
