ceph: optimize cap flush waiting

Add a 'wake' flag to ceph_cap_flush struct, which indicates if there
is someone waiting for it to finish. When getting flush ack message,
we check the 'wake' flag in corresponding ceph_cap_flush struct to
decide if we should wake up waiters. One corner case is that the
acked cap flush has 'wake' flags is set, but it is not the first one
on the flushing list. We do not wake up waiters in this case, set
'wake' flags of preceding ceph_cap_flush struct instead
