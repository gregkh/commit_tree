drm: drm_connector->s/connector_id/index/ for consistency

connector_id in the uapi actually means drm_connector->base.id, which
is something entirely different. And ->index is also consistent with
plane/encoder/CRTCS and the various drm_*_index() functions.

While at it also improve/align the kerneldoc comment.

v2: Mention where those ids are from ...

v3: Add -ing to supporting and try to not break the world.
