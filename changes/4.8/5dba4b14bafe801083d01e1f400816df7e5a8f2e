iio: ensure ret is initialized to zero before entering do loop

A recent fix to iio_buffer_read_first_n_outer removed ret from being set by
a return from wait_event_interruptible and also added a continue in a loop
which causes the variable ret to not be set when it reaches the end of the
loop.  Fix this by initializing ret to zero.

Also remove extraneous white space at the end of the loop.
