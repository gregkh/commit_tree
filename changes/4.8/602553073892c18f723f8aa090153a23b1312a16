backlight: lp855x: Add enable regulator

The LP8556 datasheet describes an EN/VDDIO input, which serves "both as
a chip enable and as a power supply reference for PWM, SDA, and SCL
inputs." The LP8556 that I'm testing doesn't respond properly if I try
to talk I2C to it too quickly after enabling VDDIO, and the LP8555
datasheet mentions a t_RESPONSE delay of up to 1 millisecond.

Support this EN/VDDIO by adding a regulator property to the binding;
enabling this regulator at probe time; and sleeping for 1 to 2ms, if the
EN/VDDIO regulator was provided.
