ima: add policy support for extending different pcrs

This patch defines a new IMA measurement policy rule option "pcr=",
which allows extending different PCRs on a per rule basis. For example,
the system independent files could extend the default IMA Kconfig
specified PCR, while the system dependent files could extend a different
PCR.

The following is an example of this usage with an SELinux policy; the
rule would extend PCR 11 with system configuration files:

  measure func=FILE_CHECK mask=MAY_READ obj_type=system_conf_t pcr=11

Changelog v3:
- FIELD_SIZEOF returns bytes, not bits. Fixed INVALID_PCR
