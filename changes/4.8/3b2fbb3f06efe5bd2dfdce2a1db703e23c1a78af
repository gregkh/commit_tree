virtio/s390: deprecate old transport

There only ever have been two host implementations of the old
s390-virtio (pre-ccw) transport: the experimental kuli userspace,
and qemu. As qemu switched its default to ccw with 2.4 (with most
users having used ccw well before that) and removed the old transport
entirely in 2.6, s390-virtio probably hasn't been in active use for
quite some time and is therefore likely to bitrot.

Let's start the slow march towards removing the code by deprecating
it.

Note that this also deprecates the early virtio console code, which
has been causing trouble in the guest without being wired up in any
relevant hypervisor code.
