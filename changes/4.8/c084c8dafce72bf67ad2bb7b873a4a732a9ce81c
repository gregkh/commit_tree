drm/sti: use new Reset API

Since 0b52297f228 ("reset: Add support for shared reset controls") the
new Reset API now demands consumers choose either an *_exclusive or a
*_shared line when requesting reset lines.

This issue was found when running a kernel containing the aforementioned
patch  which includes an informitive WARN().  It implies that one or
more used reset lines are in fact shared.  This is why we're using the
*_shared variant.
