iommu/rockchip: Use DMA API to manage coherency

Use DMA API instead of architecture internal functions like
__cpuc_flush_dcache_area() etc.

The biggest difficulty here is that dma_map and _sync calls require some
struct device, while there is no real 1:1 relation between an IOMMU
domain and some device. To overcome this, a simple platform device is
registered for each allocated IOMMU domain.

With this patch, this driver can be used on both ARM and ARM64
platforms, such as RK3288 and RK3399 respectively.
