spi: rockchip: limit transfers to (64K - 1) bytes

The Rockchip SPI controller's length register only supports 16-bits,
yielding a maximum length of 64KiB (the CTRLR1 register holds "length -
1"). Trying to transfer more than that (e.g., with a large SPI flash
read) will cause the driver to hang.

Now, it seems that while theoretically we should be able to program
CTRLR1 with 0xffff, and get a 64KiB transfer, but that also seems to
cause the core to choke, so stick with a maximum of 64K - 1 bytes --
i.e., 0xffff.
