lightnvm: remove open/close statistics for gennvm

The responsibility of the media manager is not to keep track of
open/closed blocks. This is better maintained within a target,
that already manages this information on writes.

Remove the statistics and merge the states NVM_BLK_ST_OPEN and
NVM_BLK_ST_CLOSED.
