of: fix reference counting in of_graph_get_endpoint_by_regs

The called of_graph_get_next_endpoint() already decrements the refcount
of the prev node, so it is wrong to do it again in the calling function.

Use the for_each_endpoint_of_node() helper to interate through the
endpoint OF nodes, which already does the right thing and simplifies
the code a bit.

Fixes: 8ccd0d0ca041
(of: add helper for getting endpoint node of specific identifiers)
