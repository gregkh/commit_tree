crypto: testmgr - Allow leading zeros in RSA

This patch allows RSA implementations to produce output with
leading zeroes.  testmgr will skip leading zeroes when comparing
the output.

This patch also tries to make the RSA test function generic enough
to potentially handle other akcipher algorithms.
