KVM: Add devid in kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry

Enhance kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry to transport the device id
field, devid. A new flags field makes possible to indicate the
devid is valid. Those additions are used for ARM GICv3 ITS MSI
injection. The original struct msi_msg msi field is replaced by
a new custom structure that embeds the new fields.
