arm64: kprobes: Cleanup jprobe_return

jprobe_return seems to have aged badly. Comments referring to
non-existent behaviours, and a dangerous habit of messing
with registers without telling the compiler.

This patches applies the following remedies:
- Fix the comments to describe the actual behaviour
- Tidy up the asm sequence to directly assign the
  stack pointer without clobbering extra registers
- Mark the rest of the function as unreachable() so
  that the compiler knows that there is no need for
  an epilogue
- Stop making jprobe_return_break a global function
  (you really don't want to call that guy, and it isn't
  even a function).

Tested with tcp_probe.
