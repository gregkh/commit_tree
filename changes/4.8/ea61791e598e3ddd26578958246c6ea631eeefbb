drm/i915: Actually read out DPLL0 vco on skl from hardware

Currently we're trying to guess which lcpll vco frequency is used
use based on the cdclk. That doesn't work for cdclk==540 since
both vco frequencies can generate a 540 Mhz output. Let's stop
guessing and just read the actual vco frequency from the
hardware.
