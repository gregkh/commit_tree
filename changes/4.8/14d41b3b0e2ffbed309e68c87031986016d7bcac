drm/i915: Move the SKL DPLL0 VCO computation into intel_dp_compute_config()

Shared plls won't get assigned until the .compute_clocks() hook gets
called, which happens from the crtc .atomic_check hook. That's too late
as the cdclk computation has already happened. So let's move the DPLL0
VCO computation into intel_dp_compute_config() so that it's done when
the cdclk computation happens. Also only do it for eDP since we only
pick DPLL0 for eDP.
