nvme: add keep-alive support

Periodic keep-alive is a mandatory feature in NVMe over Fabrics, and
optional in NVMe 1.2.1 for PCIe.  This patch adds periodic keep-alive
sent from the host to verify that the controller is still responsive
and vice-versa.  The keep-alive timeout is user-defined (with
keep_alive_tmo connection parameter) and defaults to 5 seconds.

In order to avoid a race condition where the host sends a keep-alive
competing with the target side keep-alive timeout expiration, the host
adds a grace period of 10 seconds when publishing the keep-alive timeout
to the target.

In case a keep-alive failed (or timed out), a transport specific error
recovery kicks in.

For now only NVMe over Fabrics is wired up to support keep alive, but
we can add PCIe support easily once controllers actually supporting it
become available.
