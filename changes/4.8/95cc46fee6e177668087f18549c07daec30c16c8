phy: rockchip-emmc: Wait even longer for the DLL to lock

Two times out of 2000 reboots I ran into the error message
"rockchip_emmc_phy_power: dllrdy timeout".  Presumably there is some
corner case where the DLL just takes a little longer to timeout.  Let's
give it even more time to handle these corner cases.
