igb: fix adjusting PTP timestamps for Tx/Rx latency

Fix PHY delay compensation math in igb_ptp_tx_hwtstamp() and
igb_ptp_rx_rgtstamp. Add PHY delay compensation in
igb_ptp_rx_pktstamp().

In the IGB driver, there are two functions that retrieve timestamps
received by the PHY - igb_ptp_rx_rgtstamp() and igb_ptp_rx_pktstamp().
The previous commit only changed igb_ptp_rx_rgtstamp(), and the change
was incorrect.

There are two instances in which PHY delay compensations should be
made:

- Before the packet transmission over the PHY, the latency between
  when the packet is timestamped and transmission of the packets,
  should be an add operation, but it is currently a subtract.

- After the packets are received from the PHY, the latency between
  the receiving and timestamping of the packets should be a subtract
  operation, but it is currently an add.
