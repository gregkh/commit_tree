drm/i915: Unbreak interrupts on pre-gen6

Prior to gen6 we didn't have per-ring IMR registers, which means that
since commit 61ff75ac20ff ("drm/i915: Simplify enabling
user-interrupts with L3-remapping") we're now masking off all interrupts
when init_render_ring() gets called. That's rather rude. Let's limit
the ring IMR frobbing to machines that actually have the per-ring IMR
registers.
