tun: switch to use skb array for tx

We used to queue tx packets in sk_receive_queue, this is less
efficient since it requires spinlocks to synchronize between producer
and consumer.

This patch tries to address this by:

- switch from sk_receive_queue to a skb_array, and resize it when
  tx_queue_len was changed.
- introduce a new proto_ops peek_len which was used for peeking the
  skb length.
- implement a tun version of peek_len for vhost_net to use and convert
  vhost_net to use peek_len if possible.

Pktgen test shows about 15.3% improvement on guest receiving pps for small
buffers:

Before: ~1300000pps
After : ~1500000pps
