PM / Hibernate: Don't let kasan instrument snapshot.c

Kasan causes the compiler to instrument C code and is used at runtime to
detect accesses to memory that has been freed, or not yet allocated.

The code in snapshot.c saves and restores memory when hibernating. This will
access whole pages in the slab cache that have both free and allocated
areas, resulting in a large number of false positives from Kasan.

Disable instrumentation of this file.
