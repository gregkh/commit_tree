s390/qeth: fix indentation in qeth_l3_arp_query

gcc-6 warns about obviously wrong indentation:
drivers/s390/net/qeth_l3_main.c: In function 'qeth_l3_arp_query':
drivers/s390/net/qeth_l3_main.c:2315:3: warning: this 'if' clause does not
guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
   if (copy_to_user(udata, qinfo.udata, 4))
   ^~
drivers/s390/net/qeth_l3_main.c:2317:4: note: ...this statement, but the
latter is misleadingly indented as if it is guarded by the 'if'
    goto free_and_out;
    ^~~~

Although this particular case is harmless, fix the indentation to get rid
of that warning and improve readability.
