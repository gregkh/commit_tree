serial: sh-sci: Clear RX, error, and break flags during reset

Setting the FIFO reset bits is not sufficient to reset the RX FIFO.
After this the status register's RDF flag bit may still be set, causing
the reception of one stale byte of data.

To fix this, clear all status flag bits related to reception, error, and
break handling, cfr. the initialization flowchart in the datasheet.
