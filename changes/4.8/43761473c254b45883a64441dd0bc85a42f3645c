audit: fix a double fetch in audit_log_single_execve_arg()

There is a double fetch problem in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
where we first check the execve(2) argumnets for any "bad" characters
which would require hex encoding and then re-fetch the arguments for
logging in the audit record[1].  Of course this leaves a window of
opportunity for an unsavory application to munge with the data.

This patch reworks things by only fetching the argument data once[2]
into a buffer where it is scanned and logged into the audit
records(s).  In addition to fixing the double fetch, this patch
improves on the original code in a few other ways: better handling
of large arguments which require encoding, stricter record length
checking, and some performance improvements (completely unverified,
but we got rid of some strlen() calls, that's got to be a good
thing).

As part of the development of this patch, I've also created a basic
regression test for the audit-testsuite, the test can be tracked on
GitHub at the following link:

[1] If you pay careful attention, there is actually a triple fetch
problem due to a strnlen_user() call at the top of the function.

[2] This is a tiny white lie, we do make a call to strnlen_user()
prior to fetching the argument data.  I don't like it, but due to the
way the audit record is structured we really have no choice unless we
copy the entire argument at once (which would require a rather
wasteful allocation).  The good news is that with this patch the
kernel no longer relies on this strnlen_user() value for anything
beyond recording it in the log, we also update it with a trustworthy
value whenever possible.
