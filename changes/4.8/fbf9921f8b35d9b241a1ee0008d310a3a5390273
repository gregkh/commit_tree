i2c: qup: Fix error handling

Among the bus errors reported from the QUP_MASTER_STATUS register
only NACK is considered and transfer gets suspended, while
other errors are ignored. Correct this and suspend the transfer
for other errors as well. This avoids unnecessary 'timeouts' which
happens when waiting for events that would never happen when there
is already an error condition on the bus. Also the error handling
procedure should be the same for both NACK and other bus errors in
case of dma mode. So correct that as well.
