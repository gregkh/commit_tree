cgroup: allow NULL return from ss->css_alloc()

cgroup core expected css_alloc to return an ERR_PTR value on failure
and caused NULL deref if it returned NULL.  It's an easy mistake to
make from an alloc function and there's no ambiguity in what's being
indicated.  Update css_create() so that it interprets NULL return from
css_alloc as -ENOMEM.
