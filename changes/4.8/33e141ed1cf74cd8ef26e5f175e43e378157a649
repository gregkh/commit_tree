drm/i915:bxt: Enable Pooled EU support

This mode allows to assign EUs to pools which can process work collectively.
The command to enable this mode should be issued as part of context initialization.

The pooled mode is global, once enabled it has to stay the same across all
contexts until HW reset hence this is sent in auxiliary golden context batch.
Thanks to Mika for the preliminary review and comments.

v2: explain why this is enabled in golden context, use feature flag while
enabling the support (Chris)

v3: Include only kernel support as userspace support is not available yet.

User space clients need to know when the pooled EU feature is present
and enabled on the hardware so that they can adapt work submissions.
Create a new device info flag for this purpose.

Set has_pooled_eu to true in the Broxton static device info - Broxton
supports the feature in hardware and the driver will enable it by
default.

We need to add getparam ioctls to enable userspace to query availability of
this feature and to retrieve min. no of eus in a pool but we will expose
them once userspace support is available. Opensource users for this feature
are mesa, libva and beignet.

Beignet team is currently working on adding userspace support.
