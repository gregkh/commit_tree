netfilter: nat: convert nat bysrc hash to rhashtable

It did use a fixed-size bucket list plus single lock to protect add/del.

Unlike the main conntrack table we only need to add and remove keys.
Convert it to rhashtable to get table autosizing and per-bucket locking.

The maximum number of entries is -- as before -- tied to the number of
conntracks so we do not need another upperlimit.

The change does not handle rhashtable_remove_fast error, only possible
"error" is -ENOENT, and that is something that can happen legitimetely,
e.g. because nat module was inserted at a later time and no src manip
took place yet.

Tested with http-client-benchmark + httpterm with DNAT and SNAT rules
in place.
