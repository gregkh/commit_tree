xen: add steal_clock support on x86

The pv_time_ops structure contains a function pointer for the
"steal_clock" functionality used only by KVM and Xen on ARM. Xen on x86
uses its own mechanism to account for the "stolen" time a thread wasn't
able to run due to hypervisor scheduling.

Add support in Xen arch independent time handling for this feature by
moving it out of the arm arch into drivers/xen and remove the x86 Xen
hack.
