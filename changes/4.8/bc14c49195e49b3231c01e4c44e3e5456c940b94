powerpc/powernv: Fix MCE handler to avoid trashing CR0/CR1 registers.

The current implementation of MCE early handling modifies CR0/1 registers
without saving its old values. Fix this by moving early check for
powersaving mode to machine_check_handle_early().

The power architecture 2.06 or later allows the possibility of getting
machine check while in nap/sleep/winkle. The last bit of HSPRG0 is set
to 1, if thread is woken up from winkle. Hence, clear the last bit of
HSPRG0 (r13) before MCE handler starts using it as paca pointer.

Also, the current code always puts the thread into nap state irrespective
of whatever idle state it woke up from. Fix that by looking at
paca->thread_idle_state and put the thread back into same state where it
came from.
