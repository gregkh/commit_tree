ide: hpt366: fix incorrect mask when checking at cmd_high_time

According to the HPT366 data sheet, PCI config space dword 0x40-0x43
bits 11:8 specify the primary drive cmd_high_time, however,
currently just 3 bits of the 4 are being used because the mask
is 0x07 and not 0x0f.  Fix the mask, allowing for the 40MHz clock
to be detected.

Also add in missing space between switch and parenthesis to clean
up a checkpatch warning.
