drm/rockchip: Fix crtc_state->event signalling

It's not permissible to look at plane->state from interrupt context,
since doing that would need the irq handler to acquire the
plane->mutex lock.

The other problem is that if we pipeline updates using the new
nonblocking atomic helpers new state gets commit before the irq
handler fires, resulting in a lost event.

Fix both issues by caching the necessary values in vop_win, protected
by dev->event_lock.
