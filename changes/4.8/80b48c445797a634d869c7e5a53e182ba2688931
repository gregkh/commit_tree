bpf: don't use raw processor id in generic helper

Use smp_processor_id() for the generic helper bpf_get_smp_processor_id()
instead of the raw variant. This allows for preemption checks when we
have DEBUG_PREEMPT, and otherwise uses the raw variant anyway. We only
need to keep the raw variant for socket filters, but we can reuse the
helper that is already there from cBPF side.
