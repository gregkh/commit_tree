cxl: Fix NULL dereference in cxl_context_init() on PowerVM guests

Commit f67a6722d650 ("cxl: Workaround PE=0 hardware limitation in
Mellanox CX4") added a "min_pe" field to struct cxl_service_layer_ops,
to allow us to work around a Mellanox CX-4 hardware limitation.

When allocating the PE number in cxl_context_init(), we read from
ctx->afu->adapter->native->sl_ops->min_pe to get the minimum PE number.
Unsurprisingly, in a PowerVM guest ctx->afu->adapter->native is NULL,
and guests don't have a cxl_service_layer_ops struct anywhere.

Move min_pe from struct cxl_service_layer_ops to struct cxl so it's
accessible in both native and PowerVM environments. For the Mellanox
CX-4, set the min_pe value in set_sl_ops().
