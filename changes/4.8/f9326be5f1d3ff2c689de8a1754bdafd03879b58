drm/i915: Rearrange switch_context to load the aliasing ppgtt on first use

The code to switch_mm() is already handled by i915_switch_context(), the
only difference required to setup the aliasing ppgtt is that we need to
emit te switch_mm() on the first context, i.e. when transitioning from
engine->last_context == NULL. This allows us to defer the
initialisation of the GPU from early device initialisation to first use,
which should marginally speed up both. The caveat is that we then defer
the context initialisation until first use - i.e. we cannot assume that
the GPU engines are initialised. For example, this means that power
contexts for rc6 (Ironlake) need to explicitly loaded, as they are.
