s5p-mfc: Set device name for reserved memory region devs

The devices don't have a name set, so makes dev_name() returns NULL which
makes harder to identify the devices that are causing issues, for example:

WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 616 at drivers/base/core.c:251 device_release+0x8c/0x90
Device '(null)' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.

And after setting the device name:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 591 at drivers/base/core.c:251 device_release+0x8c/0x90
Device 's5p-mfc-l' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.
