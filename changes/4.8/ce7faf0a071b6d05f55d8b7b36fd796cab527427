be2net: fix definition of be_max_eqs()

The EQs available on a function are shared between NIC and RoCE.
The be_max_eqs() macro was so far being used to refer to the max number of
EQs available for NIC. This has caused some confusion in the code. To fix
this confusion this patch introduces a new macro called be_max_nic_eqs()
to refer to the max number of EQs avialable for NIC only and renames
be_max_eqs() to be_max_func_eqs().
