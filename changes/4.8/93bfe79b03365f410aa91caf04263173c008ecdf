regulator: qcom_spmi: Update mvs1/mvs2 switches on pm8941

The mvs1 and mvs2 switches are actually called 5vs1 and 5vs2 on
some datasheets. Let's rename them to match the datasheets and
also match the RPM based regulator driver which calls these by
their 5vs names (see qcom_smd-regulator.c). There aren't any
users of these regulators so far, so there aren't any concerns of
DT ABI breakage here. While we're here making updates to the
switches, also mandate usage of the OCP irq for these switches
too.
