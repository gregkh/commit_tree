mm: remove reclaim and compaction retry approximations

If per-zone LRU accounting is available then there is no point
approximating whether reclaim and compaction should retry based on pgdat
statistics.  This is effectively a revert of "mm, vmstat: remove zone
and node double accounting by approximating retries" with the difference
that inactive/active stats are still available.  This preserves the
history of why the approximation was retried and why it had to be
reverted to handle OOM kills on 32-bit systems.
