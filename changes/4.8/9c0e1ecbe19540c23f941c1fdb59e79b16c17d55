powerpc/powernv: Use PCI slot reset infrastructure

The (OPAL) firmware might provide the PCI slot reset capability
which is identified by property "ibm,reset-by-firmware" on the
PCI slot associated device node.

This routes the reset request to firmware if "ibm,reset-by-firmware"
exists in the PCI slot device node. Otherwise, the reset is done
inside kernel as before.
