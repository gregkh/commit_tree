sctp: do not clear chunk->ecn_ce_done flag

We should not clear that flag when switching to a new skb from a GSO skb
because it would cause ECN processing to happen multiple times per GSO
skb, which is not wanted. Instead, let it be processed once per chunk.
That is, in other words, once per IP header available.
