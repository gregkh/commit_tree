iio: accel: bmc150: reset chip at init time

In at least one known setup, the chip comes up in a state where reading
the chip ID returns garbage unless it's been reset, due to noise on the
wires during system boot.

All supported chips have the same reset method, and based on the
datasheets they all need 1.3 or 1.8ms to recover after reset. So, do
the conservative thing here and always reset the chip.
