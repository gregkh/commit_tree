drm/i915:bxt: implement WaProgramL3SqcReg1DefaultForPerf

This patch applies a performance enhancement workaround
based on analysis of DX and OCL S-Curve workloads. We
increase the General Priority Credits for L3SQ from the
hardware default of 56 to the max value 62, and decrease
the High Priority credits from 8 to 2.

v2: Only apply to B0 onwards

v3: Move w/a to per engine init, ie bxt_init_workarounds
