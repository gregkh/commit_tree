ovl: fix sgid on directory

When creating directory in workdir, the group/sgid inheritance from the
parent dir was omitted completely.  Fix this by calling inode_init_owner()
on overlay inode and using the resulting uid/gid/mode to create the file.

Unfortunately the sgid bit can be stripped off due to umask, so need to
reset the mode in this case in workdir before moving the directory in
place.
