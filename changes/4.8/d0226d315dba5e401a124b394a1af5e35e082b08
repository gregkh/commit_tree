powerpc/opal: Add inline function to get rc from an ASYNC_COMP opal_msg

An opal_msg of type OPAL_MSG_ASYNC_COMP contains the return code in the
params[1] struct member. However this isn't intuitive or obvious when
reading the code and requires that a user look at the skiboot
documentation or opal-api.h to verify this.

Add an inline function to get the return code from an opal_msg and update
call sites accordingly.
