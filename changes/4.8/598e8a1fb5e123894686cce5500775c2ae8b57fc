rtc: m68k: provide ioctl for q40

The q40 platform is the only machine in the kernel that provides
RTC_PLL_GET/RTC_PLL_SET ioctl commands in its rtc through the
mach_get_rtc_pll/mach_set_rtc_pll callbacks.

However, this currenctly works only in the old-style genrtc
driver, not the (somewhat) modern rtc-generic driver replacing
it. This adds an ioctl implementation to the m68k generic_rtc_ops
in order to let both drivers provide the same API.

After this, we should be able to remove support for genrtc
from the m68k architecture.
