powerpc: Remove mfvtb()

This function is only used by get_vtb(). They are almost the same except
the reading from the real register. Move the mfspr() to get_vtb() and
kill the function mfvtb(). With this, we can eliminate the use of
cpu_has_feature() in very core header file like reg.h. This is a
preparation for the use of jump label for cpu_has_feature().
