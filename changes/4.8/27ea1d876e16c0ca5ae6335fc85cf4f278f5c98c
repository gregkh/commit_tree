drbd: al_write_transaction: skip re-scanning of bitmap page pointer array

For larger devices, the array of bitmap page pointers can grow very
large (8000 pointers per TB of storage).

For each activity log transaction, we need to flush the associated
bitmap pages to stable storage. Currently, we just "mark" the respective
pages while setting up the transaction, then tell the bitmap code to
write out all marked pages, but skip unchanged pages.

But one such transaction can affect only a small number of bitmap pages,
there is no need to scan the full array of several (ten-)thousand
page pointers to find the few marked ones.

Instead, remember the index numbers of the few affected pages,
and later only re-check those to skip duplicates and unchanged ones.
