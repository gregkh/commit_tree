drm/i915: Merge i915_dma.c into i915_drv.c

i915_dma.c used to contain the DRI1/UMS horror show, but now all that
remains are the out-of-place driver level interfaces (such as
allocating, initialising and registering the driver). These should be in
i915_drv.c alongside similar routines for suspend/resume.
