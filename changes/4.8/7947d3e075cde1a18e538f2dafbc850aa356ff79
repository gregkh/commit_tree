mac80211: Add support for beacon report radio measurement

Add the following to support beacon report radio measurement
with the measurement mode field set to passive or active:
1. Propagate the required scan duration to the device
2. Report the scan start time (in terms of TSF)
3. Report each BSS's detection time (also in terms of TSF)

TSF times refer to the BSS that the interface that requested the
scan is connected to.
