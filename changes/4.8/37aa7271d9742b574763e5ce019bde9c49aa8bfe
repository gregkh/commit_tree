include/linux/property.h: fix typo/compile error

This fixes commit d76eebfa175e ("include/linux/property.h: fix build
issues with gcc-4.4.4").

With that commit we get the following compile error when using the
PROPERTY_ENTRY_INTEGER_ARRAY macro.

 include/linux/property.h:201:39: error: `u32_data' undeclared (first
                 use in this function)
  PROPERTY_ENTRY_INTEGER_ARRAY(_name_, u32, _val_)
                                       ^
 include/linux/property.h:193:17: note: in definition of macro
                 `PROPERTY_ENTRY_INTEGER_ARRAY'
  { .pointer = { _type_##_data = _val_ } },  \
                 ^

This needs a '.' to reference the union member.  It seems this was just
overlooked here since it is done correctly in similar constructs in
other parts of the original commit.

This fix is in preparation of upcoming commits that will use this macro.
