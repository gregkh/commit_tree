xfs: simple btree query range should look right if LE lookup fails

If the initial LOOKUP_LE in the simple query range fails to find
anything, we should attempt to increment the btree cursor to see
if there actually /are/ records for what we're trying to find.
Without this patch, a bnobt range query of (0, $agsize) returns
no results because the leftmost record never has a startblock
of zero.
