net/mlx5: E-Switch, Return the correct devlink e-switch mode

Since mlx5 has also the NONE e-switch mode, we must translate from mlx5
mode to devlink mode on the devlink eswitch mode get call, do that.

While here, remove the mlx5_ prefix from the static function helpers
that deal with the mode to comply with the rest of the code.
