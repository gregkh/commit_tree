Revert "Revert "dts: msm8974: Add blsp2_bam dma node""

This puts back in place the blsp2_bam node.  This can be safely added
due to the addition of the special qcom,controlled-remotely flag that
will be used on specific boards that require it.

This reverts commit 338d51889851cb2ac900d2ec75c8185afcde8caf.
