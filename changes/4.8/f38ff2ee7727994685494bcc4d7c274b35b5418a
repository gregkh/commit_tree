i40e: Change some init flow for the client

This change makes a common flow for Client instance open during init
and reset path. The Client subtask can handle both the cases instead of
making a separate notify_client_of_open call.
Also it may fix a bug during reset where the service task was leaking
some memory and causing issues.
