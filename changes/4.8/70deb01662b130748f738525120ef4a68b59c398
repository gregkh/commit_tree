qeth: omit outbound queue 3 for unicast packets in Priority Queuing on HiperSockets

On HiperSockets only outbound queues 0 to 2 are available for unicast
packets. Current Priority Queuing implementation in the qeth driver puts
outgoing packets in outbound queues 0 to 3.

This puts outgoing unicast packets into outbound queue 2 instead of
outbound queue 3 when using Priority Queuing on a HiperSocket.
Additionally, the default outbound queue cannot be set to outbound queue 3
on HiperSockets.
