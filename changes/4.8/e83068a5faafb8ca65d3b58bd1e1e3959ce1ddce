dm mpath: add optional "queue_mode" feature

Allow a user to specify an optional feature 'queue_mode <mode>' where
<mode> may be "bio", "rq" or "mq" -- which corresponds to bio-based,
request_fn rq-based, and blk-mq rq-based respectively.

If the queue_mode feature isn't specified the default for the
"multipath" target is still "rq" but if dm_mod.use_blk_mq is set to Y
it'll default to mode "mq".

This new queue_mode feature introduces the ability for each multipath
device to have its own queue_mode (whereas before this feature all
multipath devices effectively had to have the same queue_mode).

This commit also goes a long way to eliminate the awkward (ab)use of
DM_TYPE_*, the associated filter_md_type() and other relatively fragile
and difficult to maintain code.
