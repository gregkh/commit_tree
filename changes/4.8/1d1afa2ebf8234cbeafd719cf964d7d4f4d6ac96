net: hns: register phy device in each mac initial sequence

In ACPI case, there is no interface to register phy device to mdio-bus.
Phy device has to be registered itself to mdio-bus, and then enet can
get the phy device's info so that it can config the phy-device to help
to trasmit and receive data.
HNS hardware topology is as below. The MDIO controller may control several
PHY-devices, and each PHY-device connects to a MAC device. PHY-devices
will register when each mac find PHY device in initial sequence.
