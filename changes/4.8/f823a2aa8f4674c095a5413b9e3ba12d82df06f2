brcmsmac: Initialize power in brcms_c_stf_ss_algo_channel_get()

wlc_phy_txpower_get_current() does a logical OR of power->flags, which
presumes that power.flags was initiliazed earlier by the caller,
unfortunately, this is not the case, so make sure we zero out the struct
tx_power before calling into wlc_phy_txpower_get_current().
