bcma: add PCI ID for Foxconn's BCM43142 device

After discovering there are 2 very different 14e4:4365 PCI devices we
made ID tables less generic. Back then we believed there are only 2 such
devices:
1) 14e4:4365 1028:0016 with SoftMAC BCM43142 chipset
2) 14e4:4365 14e4:4365 with FullMAC BCM4366 chipset

>From the recent report it appears there is also 14e4:4365 105b:e092
which should be claimed by bcma. Add back support for it.
