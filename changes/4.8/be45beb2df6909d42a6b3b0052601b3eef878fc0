genirq: Add runtime power management support for IRQ chips

Some IRQ chips may be located in a power domain outside of the CPU
subsystem and hence will require device specific runtime power
management. In order to support such IRQ chips, add a pointer for a
device structure to the irq_chip structure, and if this pointer is
populated by the IRQ chip driver and CONFIG_PM is selected in the kernel
configuration, then the pm_runtime_get/put APIs for this chip will be
called when an IRQ is requested/freed, respectively.
