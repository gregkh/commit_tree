MIPS: Lantiq: Use the real EXIN count

We runtime load the available external interrupts into an array and store
the number inside exin_avail. Some of the code however uses MAX_EIU for
looping over the array which may partially be 0. This is a cosmetic fix as
the existing code works as is. It is just nicer to only loop over the array
elements that were actually populated during probe.
