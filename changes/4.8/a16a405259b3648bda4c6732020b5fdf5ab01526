drm/i915: Track the previous pinned context inside the request

As the contexts are accessed by the hardware until the switch is completed
to a new context, the hardware may still be writing to the context object
after the breadcrumb is visible. We must not unpin/unbind/prune that
object whilst still active and so we keep the previous context pinned until
the following request. We can generalise the tracking we already do via
the engine->last_context and move it to the request so that it works
equally for execlists and GuC.

v2: Drop the execlists double pin as that exposes a race inside the lrc
irq handler as it tries to access the context after it may be retired.
