firmware: provide infrastructure to make fw caching optional

Some low memory systems with complex peripherals cannot afford to have
the relatively large firmware images taking up valuable memory during
suspend and resume.  Change the internal implementation of
firmware_class to disallow caching based on a configurable option.  In
the near future, variants of request_firmware will take advantage of
this feature.
