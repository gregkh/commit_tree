ALSA: arm: Fix empty menuconfig SND_ARM

commit 3c8f7710c1c4 ("ASoC: fix broken pxa SoC support") has removed
the SND_ARM dependency from SND_PXA2XX_LIB and SND_PXA2XX_LIB_AC97,
by moving these config entries outside of the "if SND_ARM ... endif"
construct.

However, by placing these 2 symbols right between the SND_ARM
menuconfig definition and the first SND_ARM menu entry, the side
effect is that the SND_ARM menu becomes empty and all the config
entries caught between "if SND_ARM ... endif" no more belong to
menuconfig SND_ARM, but to its parent (menuconfig SND).

Fix this.
