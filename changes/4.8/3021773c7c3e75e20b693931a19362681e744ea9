MIPS: DEC: Avoid la pseudo-instruction in delay slots

When expanding the la or dla pseudo-instruction in a delay slot the GNU
assembler will complain should the pseudo-instruction expand to multiple
actual instructions, since only the first of them will be in the delay
slot leading to the pseudo-instruction being only partially executed if
the branch is taken. Use of PTR_LA in the dec int-handler.S leads to
such warnings:

  arch/mips/dec/int-handler.S: Assembler messages:
  arch/mips/dec/int-handler.S:149: Warning: macro instruction expanded into multiple instructions in a branch delay slot
  arch/mips/dec/int-handler.S:198: Warning: macro instruction expanded into multiple instructions in a branch delay slot

Avoid this by open coding the PTR_LA macros.
