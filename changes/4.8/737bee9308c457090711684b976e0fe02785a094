libata-scsi: better style in ata_msense_*()

`changeable` is the "version" of mode page requested by the user.
It will be less confusing/misleading if we do not check it
"together" with the setting bits of the drive.

Not to mention that we currently have ata_mselect_*() implemented
in a way that each of them will serve exclusively a particular bit
on each page. The old style will hence make the condition look even
more unnecessarily arcane if the ata_msense_*() is reflecting more
than one bit.
