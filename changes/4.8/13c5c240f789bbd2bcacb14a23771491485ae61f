bpf: add bpf_get_hash_recalc helper

If skb_clear_hash() was invoked due to mangling of relevant headers and
BPF program needs skb->hash later on, we can add a helper to trigger hash
recalculation via bpf_get_hash_recalc().

The helper will return the newly retrieved hash directly, but later access
can also be done via skb context again through skb->hash directly (inline)
without needing to call the helper once more.
