NFC: port100: Explicitly set NFC-F framing for NFC-DEP

When setting the driver framing as NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_NFCF_NFC_DEP it
used to be already configured as NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_NFCF which is the
same. So this entry was empty in the in_protocols table.
Now that the digital stack can handle PLS requests, it can be changed
on the fly from NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_NFCA_NFC_DEP.
This patch explicitly defines the framing configuration values for
NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_NFCF_NFC_DEP.
