MAINTAINERS: Add ARM ARCHITECTED TIMER entry

The ARM architected timer driver falls under the drivers/clocksource/
catch-all in MAINTAINERS, and get_maintainers.pl doesn't suggest a
number of people who should be Cc'd.

The ARM architected timer is a core component of ARMv7+VE and ARMv8, and
is critical to the correct operation of both architecture ports (and
their respective KVM code), and patches to it should have review by
knowledgeable interested parties.

This patch adds a MAINTAINERS entry for the driver and its low-level
arch components, such that get_maintainer.pl will always include
relevant interested parties for modifications to the driver. For the
timebeing, this means myself and Marc Zyngier.
