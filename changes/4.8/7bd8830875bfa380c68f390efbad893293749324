cgroupns: Fix the locking in copy_cgroup_ns

If "clone(CLONE_NEWCGROUP...)" is called it results in a nice lockdep
valid splat.

In __cgroup_proc_write the lock ordering is:
     cgroup_mutex -- through cgroup_kn_lock_live
     cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem

In copy_process the guts of clone the lock ordering is:
     cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem -- through threadgroup_change_begin
     cgroup_mutex -- through copy_namespaces -- copy_cgroup_ns

lockdep reports some a different call chains for the first ordering of
cgroup_mutex and cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem but it is harder to trace.
This is most definitely deadlock potential under the right
circumstances.

Fix this by by skipping the cgroup_mutex and making the locking in
copy_cgroup_ns mirror the locking in cgroup_post_fork which also runs
during fork under the cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem.
