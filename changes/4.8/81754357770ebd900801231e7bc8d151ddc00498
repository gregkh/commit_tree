fs: Update i_[ug]id_(read|write) to translate relative to s_user_ns

For filesystems mounted from a user namespace on-disk ids should
be translated relative to s_users_ns rather than init_user_ns.

When an id in the filesystem doesn't exist in s_user_ns the
associated id in the inode will be set to INVALID_[UG]ID, which
turns these into de facto "nobody" ids. This actually maps pretty
well into the way most code already works, and those places where
it didn't were fixed in previous patches. Moving forward vfs code
needs to be careful to handle instances where ids in inodes may
be invalid.
