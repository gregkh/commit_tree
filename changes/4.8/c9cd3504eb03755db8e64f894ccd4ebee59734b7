libata-scsi: fix D_SENSE bit relection in control mode page

The bit should always be set to 1 when the requested version of
page is "changeable" because we've made it so in ata_mselect_control().
Also, it should always be set to 1 if ATA_DFLAG_D_SENSE is set (when
the requested version of page is "current" or "default").
