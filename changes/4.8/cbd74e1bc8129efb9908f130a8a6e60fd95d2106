cxl: Use fixed width predefined types in data structure.

This patch fixes a regression introduced by commit b810253bd934 ("cxl:
Add mechanism for delivering AFU driver specific events").

It changes the type u8 to __u8 in the uapi header cxl.h, because the
former is a kernel internal type, and may not be defined in userland
build environments, in particular when cross-compiling libcxl on x86_64
linux machines (RHEL6.7 and Ubuntu 16.04).

This patch also changes the size of the field data_size, and makes it
constant, to support 32-bit userland applications running on big-endian
ppc64 kernels transparently.

mpe: This is an ABI change, however the ABI was only added during the
4.8 merge window so has never been part of a released kernel - therefore
we give ourselves permission to change it.
