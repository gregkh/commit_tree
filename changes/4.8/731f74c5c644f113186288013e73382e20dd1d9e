drm/i915: tweak gen6_for_{each_pde, all_pdes} macros

Gen8 versions of these macros were updated a few months ago
(e8ebd8e drm/i915: eliminate 'temp' in gen8_for_each macros)
originally because at least one iterator could generate an
out of bounds access, but also because eliminating the 'temp'
parameter generated smaller and faster code.

Matthew Auld recently noticed the same problem with the gen6
versions and provided a patch
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2016-June/099334.html
but while we're changing these, we might as well make them as
much like the gen8 versions as possible, including the style
of using "&& (..., true)" rather than ": (..., 1) : 0", and
of course eliminating the redundant 'temp'.

Furthermore, the "all_pdes" version is only used in one place,
so we can improve code efficiency by changing both the macro
parameters and the calling code to reduce extra dereferences.
