spi: omap2-mcspi: Add comments for RX only DMA buffer workaround

OMAP35x and OMAP37x mentions in the McSPI End-of-Transfer Sequences section
that if the McSPI is configured as a Master and only DMA RX is being
performed then the DMA transfer size needs to be reduced by 1 or 2.

This was originally implemented by:
commit 57c5c28dbc83 ("spi: omap2_mcspi rxdma bugfix")

This patch adds comments to clarify what is going on in the code since its
not obvious what problem its addressing.
