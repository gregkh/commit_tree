IB/mlx5: Add port protocol stats

Expose new counters using the get protocol stats callback.
We expose the following counters:

|                     |    |    | A request that previously executed is  |

|                     |    |    | PSN for RDMA READ or ATOMIC response   |
|                     |    |    | The QP retry limit did not exceed.     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|local_ack_timeout_err| +  | -  | Number of NO ACK responses from        |

Counters are available if all of them are supported.
