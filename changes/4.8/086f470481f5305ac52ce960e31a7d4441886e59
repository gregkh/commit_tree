MAINTAINERS: Change L to M for Broadcom ARM/ARM64 SoC entries

bcm-kernel-feedback-list@broadcom.com is a Broadcom internal
mailing-list for which no external subscribers are allowed for now, so
update the different entries from L to M to reflect that and order
entries from M to L in order of preference.
