net: dsa: b53: Add support for Broadcom RoboSwitch

This patch adds support for Broadcom's BCM53xx switch family, also known
as RoboSwitch. Some of these switches are ubiquituous, found in home
routers, Wi-Fi routers, DSL and cable modem gateways and other
networking related products.

This drivers adds the library driver (b53_common.c) as well as a few bus
glue drivers for MDIO, SPI, Switch Register Access Block (SRAB) and
memory-mapped I/O into a SoC's address space (Broadcom BCM63xx/33xx).

Basic operations are supported to bring the Layer 1/2 up and running,
but not much more at this point, subsequent patches add the remaining
features.
