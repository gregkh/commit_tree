    drm/i915/psr: Make idle_frames sensible again

There are panels that needs 4 idle frames before entering PSR,
but VBT is unproperly set.

Also lately it was identified that idle frame count calculated at HW
can be off by 1, what makes the minimum of 2, at least.

Without the current vbt+1 we are with the risk of having HW calculating
0 idle frames and entering PSR when it shouldn't. Regardless the lack
of link training.

[Jani: there is some disagreement on the explanation, but the commit
regresses so revert it is.]
