arm64: spinlocks: implement smp_mb__before_spinlock() as smp_mb()

smp_mb__before_spinlock() is intended to upgrade a spin_lock() operation
to a full barrier, such that prior stores are ordered with respect to
loads and stores occuring inside the critical section.

Unfortunately, the core code defines the barrier as smp_wmb(), which
is insufficient to provide the required ordering guarantees when used in
conjunction with our load-acquire-based spinlock implementation.

This patch overrides the arm64 definition of smp_mb__before_spinlock()
to map to a full smp_mb().
