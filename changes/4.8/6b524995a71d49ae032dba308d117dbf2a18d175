dax: remote unused fault wrappers

Remove the unused wrappers dax_fault() and dax_pmd_fault().  After this
removal, rename __dax_fault() and __dax_pmd_fault() to dax_fault() and
dax_pmd_fault() respectively, and update all callers.

The dax_fault() and dax_pmd_fault() wrappers were initially intended to
capture some filesystem independent functionality around page faults
(calling sb_start_pagefault() & sb_end_pagefault(), updating file mtime
and ctime).

However, the following commits:

   5726b27b09cc ("ext2: Add locking for DAX faults")
   ea3d7209ca01 ("ext4: fix races between page faults and hole punching")

added locking to the ext2 and ext4 filesystems after these common
operations but before __dax_fault() and __dax_pmd_fault() were called.
This means that these wrappers are no longer used, and are unlikely to
be used in the future.

XFS has had locking analogous to what was recently added to ext2 and
ext4 since DAX support was initially introduced by:

   6b698edeeef0 ("xfs: add DAX file operations support")
