powerpc/sparse: Pass endianness to sparse

Explicitly give sparse an endianness in the Makefile, so that it
doesn't get confused.

Normally we have #ifdef one and #else the other, so it doesn't usually
matter, but we have been bitten by it before, and indeed this patch
fixes a number of sparse errors.
