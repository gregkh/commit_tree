ocfs2/dlm: fix race between convert and migration

Commit ac7cf246dfdb ("ocfs2/dlm: fix race between convert and recovery")
checks if lockres master has changed to identify whether new master has
finished recovery or not.  This will introduce a race that right after
old master does umount ( means master will change), a new convert
request comes.

In this case, it will reset lockres state to DLM_RECOVERING and then
retry convert, and then fail with lockres->l_action being set to
OCFS2_AST_INVALID, which will cause inconsistent lock level between
ocfs2 and dlm, and then finally BUG.

Since dlm recovery will clear lock->convert_pending in
dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, we can use it to correctly identify
the race case between convert and recovery.  So fix it.
