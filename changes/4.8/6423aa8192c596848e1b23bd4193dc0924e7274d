mm/page_alloc.c: recalculate some of node threshold when on/offline memory

Some of node threshold depends on number of managed pages in the node.
When memory is going on/offline, it can be changed and we need to adjust
them.

Add recalculation to appropriate places and clean-up related functions
for better maintenance.
