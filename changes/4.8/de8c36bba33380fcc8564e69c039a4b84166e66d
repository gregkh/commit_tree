scsi: lpfc: avoid harmless comparison warning

When building with -Wextra, we get a lot of warnings for the lpfc driver
concerning expressions that are always true, starting with:

drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c: In function 'lpfc_enable_npiv_init':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c:2786:77: error: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true [-Werror=type-limits]
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c: In function 'lpfc_enable_rrq_init':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c:2802:76: error: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true [-Werror=type-limits]
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c: In function 'lpfc_suppress_link_up_init':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c:2812:2050: error: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true [-Werror=type-limits]
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c: In function 'lpfc_log_verbose_init':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_attr.c:3064:1930: error: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true [-Werror=type-limits]

The code works as intended, but it would be nice to shut up the warning
so we don't clutter up build logs with this. Using a separate inline
function for it makes it clear to the compiler that the comparison is
necessary in the caller but still lets it do the constant-folding.
