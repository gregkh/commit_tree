block: Convert fifo_time from ulong to u64

Currently rq->fifo_time is unsigned long but CFQ stores nanosecond
timestamp in it which would overflow on 32-bit archs. Convert it to u64
to avoid the overflow. Since the rq->fifo_time is unioned with struct
call_single_data(), this does not change the size of struct request in
any way.

We have to slightly fixup block/deadline-iosched.c so that comparison
happens in the right types.
