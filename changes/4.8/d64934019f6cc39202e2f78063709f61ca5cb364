x86/efi: Use efi_exit_boot_services()

The eboot code directly calls ExitBootServices.  This is inadvisable as the
UEFI spec details a complex set of errors, race conditions, and API
interactions that the caller of ExitBootServices must get correct.  The
eboot code attempts allocations after calling ExitBootSerives which is
not permitted per the spec.  Call the efi_exit_boot_services() helper
intead, which handles the allocation scenario properly.
