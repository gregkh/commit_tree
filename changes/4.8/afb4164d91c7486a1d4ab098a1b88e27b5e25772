RDS: TCP: Refactor connection destruction to handle multiple paths

A single rds_connection may have multiple rds_conn_paths that have
to be carefully and correctly destroyed, for both rmmod and
netns-delete cases.

For both cases, we extract a single rds_tcp_connection for
each conn into a temporary list, and then invoke rds_conn_destroy()
which iteratively dismantles every path in the rds_connection.

For the netns deletion case, we additionally have to make sure
that we do not leave a socket in TIME_WAIT state, as this will
hold up the netns deletion. Thus we call rds_tcp_conn_paths_destroy()
to reset state quickly.
