arm64: KVM: VHE: Context switch MDSCR_EL1

The kprobe enablement work has uncovered that changes made by
a guest to MDSCR_EL1 were propagated to the host when VHE was
enabled, leading to unexpected exception being delivered.

Moving this register to the list of registers that are always
context-switched fixes the issue.
