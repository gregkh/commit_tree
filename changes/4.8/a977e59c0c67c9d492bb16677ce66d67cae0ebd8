asus-wmi: Create quirk for airplane_mode LED

Some Asus laptops that have an airplane-mode indicator LED, also have
the WMI WLAN user bit set, and the following bits in their DSDT:

Scope (_SB)
{
  (...)
  Device (ATKD)
  {
    (...)
    Method (WMNB, 3, Serialized)
    {
      (...)
      If (LEqual (IIA0, 0x00010002))
      {
        OWGD (IIA1)
        Return (One)
      }
    }
  }
}

So when asus-wmi uses ASUS_WMI_DEVID_WLAN_LED (0x00010002) to store the
wlan state, it drives the airplane-mode indicator LED (through the call
to OWGD) in an inverted fashion: the LED is ON when airplane mode is OFF
(since wlan is ON), and vice-versa.

This commit creates a quirk to not register a RFKill switch at all for
these laptops, to allow the asus-wireless driver to drive the airplane
mode LED correctly through the ASHS ACPI device. It also adds a match to
that quirk for the Asus X555UB, which is affected by this problem.
