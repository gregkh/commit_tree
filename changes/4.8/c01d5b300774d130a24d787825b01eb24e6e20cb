shmem: get_unmapped_area align huge page

Provide a shmem_get_unmapped_area method in file_operations, called at
mmap time to decide the mapping address.  It could be conditional on
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE, but save #ifdefs in other places by making
it unconditional.

shmem_get_unmapped_area() first calls the usual mm->get_unmapped_area
(which we treat as a black box, highly dependent on architecture and
config and executable layout).  Lots of conditions, and in most cases it
just goes with the address that chose; but when our huge stars are
rightly aligned, yet that did not provide a suitable address, go back to
ask for a larger arena, within which to align the mapping suitably.

There have to be some direct calls to shmem_get_unmapped_area(), not via
the file_operations: because of the way shmem_zero_setup() is called to
create a shmem object late in the mmap sequence, when MAP_SHARED is
requested with MAP_ANONYMOUS or /dev/zero.  Though this only matters
when /proc/sys/vm/shmem_huge has been set.
