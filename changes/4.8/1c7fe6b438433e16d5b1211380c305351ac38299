mtd: nand: add ESMT manufacturer

I got device with ESMT (Elite Semiconductor Memory Technology Inc)
F59L1G81MA flash that was detected as:
[    0.852034] nand: device found, Manufacturer ID: 0xc8, Chip ID: 0xd1
[    0.858402] nand: Unknown NAND 128MiB 3,3V 8-bit
[    0.863031] nand: 128MiB, SLC, page size: 2048, OOB size: 64

According to the F59L1G81MA datasheet (and Read Id documentation) C8h is
a "Maker Code" which should mean ESMT. Add it to fix above "Unknown".
