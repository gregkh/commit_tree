staging: ks7010: remove cfg file handling

I verified that all but two settings from the config file can be set up
also via 'iwconfig' or 'iwpriv'. The two missing are ROM_FILE and
PhyInformationTimer. ROM_FILE can be easily dropped. There is only one
known firmware floating on the net, so, the name is fix and we can make
this constant. Frankly, I don't know when PhyInformationTimer needs to
be set to non-zero. But if we need it somewhen, there is already
(currently commented out) code to add this as another private method, so
we could use that. Summa summarum: We can remove the config file
handling and the example config file. The only useful action,
initialization of the configuration struct, is now moved to the sdio
main file.
