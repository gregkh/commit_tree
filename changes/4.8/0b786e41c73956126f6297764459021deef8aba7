drm/i915/bxt: Avoid early timeout during PLL enable

Since wait_for_atomic doesn't re-check the wait-for condition after
expiry of the timeout it can fail when called from non-atomic context
even if the condition is set correctly before the expiry. Fix this by
using the non-atomic wait_for instead.

I noticed this via the PLL locking timing out incorrectly, with this fix
I couldn't reproduce the problem.
