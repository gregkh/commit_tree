dlm: fix malfunction of dlm_tool caused by debugfs changes

With the current kernel, `dlm_tool lockdebug` fails as below:

"dlm_tool lockdebug ED0BD86DCE724393918A1AE8FDBF1EE3
can't open /sys/kernel/debug/dlm/ED0BD86DCE724393918A1AE8FDBF1EE3:
Operation not permitted"

This is because table_open() depends on file->f_opÂ to tell which
seq_file ops should be passed down. But, the original file ops in
file->f_op is replaced by "debugfs_full_proxy_file_operations" with
commit 49d200deaa68 ("debugfs: prevent access to removed files'
private data").

Currently, I can think up 2 solutions: 1st, replace
debugfs_create_file() with debugfs_create_file_unsafe();
2nd, make different table_open#() accordingly. The 1st one
is neat, but I don't thoroughly understand its risk. Maybe
someone has a better one.
