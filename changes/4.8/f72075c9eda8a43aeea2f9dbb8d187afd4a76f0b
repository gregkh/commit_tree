x86/platform/uv: Skip UV runtime services mapping in the efi_runtime_disabled case

This problem has actually been in the UV code for a while, but we didn't
catch it until recently, because we had been relying on EFI_OLD_MEMMAP
to allow our systems to boot for a period of time.  We noticed the issue
when trying to kexec a recent community kernel, where we hit this NULL
pointer dereference in efi_sync_low_kernel_mappings():

 [    0.337515] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000880
 [    0.346276] IP: [<ffffffff8105df8d>] efi_sync_low_kernel_mappings+0x5d/0x1b0

The problem doesn't show up with EFI_OLD_MEMMAP because we skip the
chunk of setup_efi_state() that sets the efi_loader_signature for the
kexec'd kernel.  When the kexec'd kernel boots, it won't set EFI_BOOT in
setup_arch, so we completely avoid the bug.

We always kexec with noefi on the command line, so this shouldn't be an
issue, but since we're not actually checking for efi_runtime_disabled in
uv_bios_init(), we end up trying to do EFI runtime callbacks when we
shouldn't be. This patch just adds a check for efi_runtime_disabled in
uv_bios_init() so that we don't map in uv_systab when runtime_disabled ==
true.
