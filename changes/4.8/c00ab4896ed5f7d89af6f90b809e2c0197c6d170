MIPS: Remove cpu_has_safe_index_cacheops

Very early versions of the 1004K had an hardware issue that made index
cache ops unsafe so they had to be avoided and hit ops be used instead.
This may significantly slow down cache maintenance operations.  Only
very early FPGA versions of the 1004K were affected so let's get rid
of the workaround which was only implemented for the DMA cache
maintenance operations anyway.
