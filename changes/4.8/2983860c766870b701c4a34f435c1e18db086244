libata-scsi: avoid repeated calculation of number of TRIM ranges

Currently libata statically allows only 1-block (512-byte) payload
for each TRIM command. Each payload can carry 64 TRIM ranges since
each range requires 8 bytes.

It is silly to keep doing the calculation (512 / 8) in different
places. Hence, define the new ATA_MAX_TRIM_RNUM for the result.
