clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Control the evtstrm via the cmdline

Disabling the eventstream can be useful for both remotely debugging a
deployed production system and development of code using WFE-based
polling loops. Whilst this can currently be controlled via a Kconfig
option (CONFIG_ARM_ARCH_TIMER_EVTSTREAM), it's often desirable to toggle
the feature on the command line, so this patch adds a new command-line
option ("clocksource.arm_arch_timer.evtstrm") to do just that. The
default behaviour is determined based on CONFIG_ARM_ARCH_TIMER_EVTSTREAM.
