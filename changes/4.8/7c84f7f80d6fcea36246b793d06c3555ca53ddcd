hwmon: add support for Sensirion SHT3x sensors

This driver implements support for the Sensirion SHT3x-DIS chip,
a humidity and temperature sensor. Temperature is measured
in degrees celsius, relative humidity is expressed as a percentage.
In the sysfs interface, all values are scaled by 1000,
i.e. the value for 31.5 degrees celsius is 31500.
