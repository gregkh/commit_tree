vfs: cap dedupe request structure size at PAGE_SIZE

Kirill A Shutemov reports that the kernel doesn't try to cap dest_count
in any way, and uses the number to allocate kernel memory.  This causes
high order allocation warnings in the kernel log if someone passes in a
big enough value.  We should clamp the allocation at PAGE_SIZE to avoid
stressing the VM.

The two existing users of the dedupe ioctl never send more than 120
requests, so we can safely clamp dest_range at PAGE_SIZE, because with
4k pages we can handle up to 127 dedupe candidates.  Given the max
extent length of 16MB, we can end up doing 2GB of IO which is plenty.

[ Note: the "offsetof()" can't overflow, because 'count' is just a
  16-bit integer.  That's not obvious in the limited context of the
  patch, so I'm noting it here because it made me go look.  - Linus ]
