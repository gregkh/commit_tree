ila: Perform only one translation in forwarding path

When setting up ILA in a router we noticed that the the encapsulation
is invoked twice: once in the route input path and again upon route
output. To resolve this we add a flag set_csum_neutral for the
ila_update_ipv6_locator. If this flag is set and the checksum
neutral bit is also set we assume that checksum-neutral translation
has already been performed and take no further action. The
flag is set only in ila_output path. The flag is not set for ila_input and
ila_xlat.

Tested:

Used 3 netns to set to emulate a router and two hosts. The router
translates SIR addresses between the two destinations in other two netns.
Verified ping and netperf are functional.
