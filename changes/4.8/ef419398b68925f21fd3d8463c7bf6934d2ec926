proc_oom_score: remove tasklist_lock and pid_alive()

This was needed before to ensure that ->signal != 0 and do_each_thread()
is safe, see commit b95c35e76b29b ("oom: fix the unsafe usage of
badness() in proc_oom_score()") for details.

Today tsk->signal can't go away and for_each_thread(tsk) is always safe.
