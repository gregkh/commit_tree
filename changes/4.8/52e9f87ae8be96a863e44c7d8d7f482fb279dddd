mm, page_alloc: wake kswapd based on the highest eligible zone

The ac_classzone_idx is used as the basis for waking kswapd and that is
based on the preferred zoneref.  If the preferred zoneref's first zone
is lower than what is available on other nodes, it's possible that
kswapd is woken on a zone with only higher, but still eligible, zones.
As classzone_idx is strictly adhered to now, it causes a problem because
eligible pages are skipped.

For example, node 0 has only DMA32 and node 1 has only NORMAL.  An
allocating context running on node 0 may wake kswapd on node 1 telling
it to skip all NORMAL pages.
