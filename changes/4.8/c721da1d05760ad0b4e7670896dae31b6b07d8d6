ARM: dts: kirkwood: Fix PCIe label on OpenRD

While converting PCIe node on kirkwood by using label, the following
commit eb13cf8345e9 ("ARM: dts: kirkwood: Fixup pcie DT warnings")
introduced a regression on the OpenRD boards: the PCIe didn't work
anymore. As reported by Aaro Koskinen, the display/framebuffer was
lost. This commit adds the forgotten label.
