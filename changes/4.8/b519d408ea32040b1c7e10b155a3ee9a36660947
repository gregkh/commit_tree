NFSv4.1: Fix the CREATE_SESSION slot number accounting

Ensure that we conform to the algorithm described in RFC5661, section
18.36.4 for when to bump the sequence id. In essence we do it for all
cases except when the RPC call timed out, or in case of the server returning
NFS4ERR_DELAY or NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID.
