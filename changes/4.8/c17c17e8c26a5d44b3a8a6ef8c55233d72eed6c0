perf annotate: Plug filename string leak

If dso__build_id_filename(..., NULL, ...) returns !NULL its because it
allocated it, so, when reaching the  'if (dso__is_kcore()) test, we
already checked that and were just "fallbacking" to using
dso->long_name, but without freeing filename, thus leaking it.

Fix it by adding the dso__is_kcore() test to the 'or' group just after
it, the one containing the full fallback code, including freeing the
filename.
