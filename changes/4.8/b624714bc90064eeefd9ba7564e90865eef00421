fm10k: avoid possible null pointer dereference in fm10k_update_stats

It's currently possible for fm10k_update_stats to be called during the
window when we go down and the rings are removed. This can result in
a null pointer dereference. In fm10k_get_stats64 we work around this by
using ACCESS_ONCE and a null pointer check inside the loop. Use this
same flow in the fm10k_update_stats to avoid the potential null pointer.
