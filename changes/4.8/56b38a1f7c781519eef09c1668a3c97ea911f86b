pNFS: Fix post-layoutget error handling in pnfs_update_layout()

The non-retry error path is currently broken and ends up releasing the
reference to the layout twice. It also can end up clearing the
NFS_LAYOUT_FIRST_LAYOUTGET flag twice, causing a race.

In addition, the retry path will fail to decrement the plh_outstanding
counter.
