KVM: PPC: Move xics_debugfs_init out of create

As we are about to hold the kvm->lock during the create operation on KVM
devices, we should move the call to xics_debugfs_init into its own
function, since holding a mutex over extended amounts of time might not
be a good idea.

Introduce an init operation on the kvm_device_ops struct which cannot
fail and call this, if configured, after the device has been created.
