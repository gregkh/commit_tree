ARM: shmobile: apmu: Add APMU DT support via Enable method

Allow DT configuration of the APMU hardware in the case when the APMU is
pointed out in the DTB via the enable-method. The ability to configure
the APMU via C code is still kept intact to prevent DTB breakage for older
SoCs that do not rely on the enable-method for SMP support.
