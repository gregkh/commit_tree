get_maintainer: Don't check if STDIN exists in a VCS repository

If get_maintainer is not given any filename arguments on the command line,
the standard input is read for a patch.

But checking if a VCS has a file named &STDIN is not a good idea and fails.

Verify the nominal input file is not &STDIN before checking the VCS.
