mm, page_alloc: set alloc_flags only once in slowpath

In __alloc_pages_slowpath(), alloc_flags doesn't change after it's
initialized, so move the initialization above the retry: label.  Also
make the comment above the initialization more descriptive.

The only exception in the alloc_flags being constant is
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS, which may change due to TIF_MEMDIE being set on the
allocating thread.  We can fix this, and make the code simpler and a bit
more effective at the same time, by moving the part that determines
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS from gfp_to_alloc_flags() to gfp_pfmemalloc_allowed().

This means we don't have to mask out ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS in numerous
places in __alloc_pages_slowpath() anymore.  The only two tests for the
flag can instead call gfp_pfmemalloc_allowed().
