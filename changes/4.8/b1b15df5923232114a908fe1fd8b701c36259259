i40e: Explicitly write platform-specific mac address after PF reset

i40e PF reset clears mac filters. If platform-specific mac address
is used, driver has to explicitly write default mac address to mac
filters otherwise all incoming traffic destined to default mac
address will be dropped after reset.

This issue was found on SPARC while toggling i40e ntuple via ethtool.
