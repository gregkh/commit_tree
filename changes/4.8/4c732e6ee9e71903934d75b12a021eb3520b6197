drm/i915/vlv: Reset the ADPA in vlv_display_power_well_init()

While VGA hotplugging worked(ish) before, it looks like that was mainly
because we'd unintentionally enable it in
valleyview_crt_detect_hotplug() when we did a force trigger. This
doesn't work reliably enough because whenever the display powerwell on
vlv gets disabled, the values set in VLV_ADPA get cleared and
consequently VGA hotplugging gets disabled. This causes bugs such as one
we found on an Intel NUC, where doing the following sequence of
hotplugs:

      - Disconnect all monitors
      - Connect VGA
      - Disconnect VGA
      - Connect HDMI

Would result in VGA hotplugging becoming disabled, due to the powerwells
getting toggled in the process of connecting HDMI.

Changes since v3:
 - Expose intel_crt_reset() through intel_drv.h and call that in
   vlv_display_power_well_init() instead of
   encoder->base.funcs->reset(&encoder->base);

Changes since v2:
 - Use intel_encoder structs instead of drm_encoder structs

Changes since v1:
 - Instead of handling the register writes ourself, we just reuse
   intel_crt_detect()
 - Instead of resetting the ADPA during display IRQ installation, we now
   reset them in vlv_display_power_well_init()
