tracing: Fix tick_stop tracepoint symbols for user export

The symbols used in the tick_stop tracepoint were not being converted
properly into integers in the trace_stop format file. Instead we had this:

print fmt: "success=%d dependency=%s", REC->success,
    __print_symbolic(REC->dependency, { 0, "NONE" },
     { (1 << TICK_DEP_BIT_POSIX_TIMER), "POSIX_TIMER" },
     { (1 << TICK_DEP_BIT_PERF_EVENTS), "PERF_EVENTS" },
     { (1 << TICK_DEP_BIT_SCHED), "SCHED" },
     { (1 << TICK_DEP_BIT_CLOCK_UNSTABLE), "CLOCK_UNSTABLE" })

User space tools have no idea how to parse "TICK_DEP_BIT_SCHED" or the other
symbols used to do the bit shifting. The reason is that the conversion was
done with using the TICK_DEP_MASK_* symbols which are just macros that
convert to the BIT shift itself (with the exception of NONE, which was
converted properly, because it doesn't use bits, and is defined as zero).

The TICK_DEP_BIT_* needs to be denoted by TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM() in order to
have this properly converted for user space tools to parse this event.
