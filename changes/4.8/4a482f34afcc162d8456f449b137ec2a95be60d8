cgroup: bpf: Add bpf_skb_in_cgroup_proto

Adds a bpf helper, bpf_skb_in_cgroup, to decide if a skb->sk
belongs to a descendant of a cgroup2.  It is similar to the
feature added in netfilter:
commit c38c4597e4bf ("netfilter: implement xt_cgroup cgroup2 path match")

The user is expected to populate a BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGROUP_ARRAY
which will be used by the bpf_skb_in_cgroup.

Modifications to the bpf verifier is to ensure BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGROUP_ARRAY
and bpf_skb_in_cgroup() are always used together.
