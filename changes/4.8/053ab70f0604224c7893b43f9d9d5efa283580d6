Btrfs: check btree node's nritems

When btree node (level = 1) has nritems which equals to zero,
we can end up with panic due to insert_ptr()'s

BUG_ON(slot > nritems);

where slot is 1 and nritems is 0, as copy_for_split() calls
insert_ptr(.., path->slots[1] + 1, ...);

A invalid value results in the whole mess, this adds the check
for btree's node nritems so that we stop reading block when
when something is wrong.
