s390: enable kcov support

Now that hopefully all inline assemblies have been converted to single
basic blocks we can enable kcov on s390.

Note that this patch does not disable as many files on s390 like the
x86 variant does. Right now I didn't see a reason to do that, however
additional files or directories can be excluded at any time.

The runtime overhead seems to be quite high.
