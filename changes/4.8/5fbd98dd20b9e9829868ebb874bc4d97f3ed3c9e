IB/hfi1: Ignore QSFP interrupts until power stabilizes

Some QSFP cables assert the interrupt line as a side effect of module
plug-in and power up. This causes the SerDes and QSFP tuning algorithm
to begin cable initialization by reading the QSFP memory map over I2C,
which fails. This patch ignores any interrupt line assertion until
the module has completed power up and voltage rails have stabilized,
which can take a maximum of 500 ms per the SFF-8679 specification.
