shmem: make shmem_inode_info::lock irq-safe

We are going to need to call shmem_charge() under tree_lock to get
accoutning right on collapse of small tmpfs pages into a huge one.

The problem is that tree_lock is irq-safe and lockdep is not happy, that
we take irq-unsafe lock under irq-safe[1].

Let's convert the lock to irq-safe.
