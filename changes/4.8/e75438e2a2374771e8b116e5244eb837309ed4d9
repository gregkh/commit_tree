sh: make heartbeat driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config HEARTBEAT
        bool "Heartbeat LED"

....meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
