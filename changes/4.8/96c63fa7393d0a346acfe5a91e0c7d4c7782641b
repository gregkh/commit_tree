net: Add l3mdev rule

Currently, VRFs require 1 oif and 1 iif rule per address family per
VRF. As the number of VRF devices increases it brings scalability
issues with the increasing rule list. All of the VRF rules have the
same format with the exception of the specific table id to direct the
lookup. Since the table id is available from the oif or iif in the
loopup, the VRF rules can be consolidated to a single rule that pulls
the table from the VRF device.

This patch introduces a new rule attribute l3mdev. The l3mdev rule
means the table id used for the lookup is pulled from the L3 master
device (e.g., VRF) rather than being statically defined. With the
l3mdev rule all of the basic VRF FIB rules are reduced to 1 l3mdev
rule per address family (IPv4 and IPv6).

If an admin wishes to insert higher priority rules for specific VRFs
those rules will co-exist with the l3mdev rule. This capability means
current VRF scripts will co-exist with this new simpler implementation.

Currently, the rules list for both ipv4 and ipv6 look like this:
    $ ip  ru ls
    1000:       from all oif vrf1 lookup 1001
    1000:       from all iif vrf1 lookup 1001
    1000:       from all oif vrf2 lookup 1002
    1000:       from all iif vrf2 lookup 1002
    1000:       from all oif vrf3 lookup 1003
    1000:       from all iif vrf3 lookup 1003
    1000:       from all oif vrf4 lookup 1004
    1000:       from all iif vrf4 lookup 1004
    1000:       from all oif vrf5 lookup 1005
    1000:       from all iif vrf5 lookup 1005
    1000:       from all oif vrf6 lookup 1006
    1000:       from all iif vrf6 lookup 1006
    1000:       from all oif vrf7 lookup 1007
    1000:       from all iif vrf7 lookup 1007
    1000:       from all oif vrf8 lookup 1008
    1000:       from all iif vrf8 lookup 1008
    ...
    32765:      from all lookup local
    32766:      from all lookup main
    32767:      from all lookup default

With the l3mdev rule the list is just the following regardless of the
number of VRFs:
    $ ip ru ls
    1000:       from all lookup [l3mdev table]
    32765:      from all lookup local
    32766:      from all lookup main
    32767:      from all lookup default

(Note: the above pretty print of the rule is based on an iproute2
       prototype. Actual verbage may change)
