KVM: vmx: fix underflow in TSC deadline calculation

If the TSC deadline timer is programmed really close to the deadline or
even in the past, the computation in vmx_set_hv_timer can underflow and
cause delta_tsc to be set to a huge value.  This generally results
in vmx_set_hv_timer returning -ERANGE, but we can fix it by limiting
delta_tsc to be positive or zero.
