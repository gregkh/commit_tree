nvme: Don't suspend admin queue that wasn't created

This fixes a regression in my previous commit c21377f8366c ("nvme:
Suspend all queues before deletion"), which provoked an Oops in the
removal path when removing a device that became IO incapable very early
at probe (i.e. after a failed EEH recovery).

Turns out, if the error occurred very early at the probe path, before
even configuring the admin queue, we might try to suspend the
uninitialized admin queue, accessing bad memory.
