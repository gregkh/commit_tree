tick/nohz: Fix softlockup on scheduler stalls in kvm guest

tick_nohz_start_idle() is prevented to be called if the idle tick can't 
be stopped since commit 1f3b0f8243cb934 ("tick/nohz: Optimize nohz idle 
enter"). As a result, after suspend/resume the host machine, full dynticks 
kvm guest will softlockup:

 NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 26s! [swapper/0:0]
 Call Trace:
  default_idle+0x31/0x1a0

In addition, cat /proc/stat | grep cpu in guest or host:

cpu  398 16 5049 15754 5490 0 1 46 0 0
cpu0 206 5 450 0 0 0 1 14 0 0
cpu1 81 0 3937 3149 1514 0 0 9 0 0

cpu3 65 2 328 6552 1732 0 0 11 0 0

The idle and iowait states are weird 0 for cpu0(housekeeping). 

The bug is present in both guest and host kernels, and they both have 
cpu0's idle and iowait states issue, however, host kernel's suspend/resume 
path etc will touch watchdog to avoid the softlockup.

- The watchdog will not be touched in tick_nohz_stop_idle path (need be 
  touched since the scheduler stall is expected) if idle_active flags are 
  not detected.
- The idle and iowait states will not be accounted when exit idle loop 
  (resched or interrupt) if idle start time and idle_active flags are 
  not set. 

This patch fixes it by reverting commit 1f3b0f8243cb934 since can't stop 
idle tick doesn't mean can't be idle.
