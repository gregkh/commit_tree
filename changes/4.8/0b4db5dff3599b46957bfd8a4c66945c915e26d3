xfs: remove extraneous buffer flag changes

Fix up a couple places where extra flag manipulation occurs.

In the first case we clear XBF_ASYNC and then immediately reset it -
so don't bother clearing in the first place.

In the 2nd case we are at a point in the function where the buffer
must already be async, so there is no need to reset it.

Add consistent spacing around the " | " while we're at it.
