Btrfs: fill relocation block rsv after allocation

Since we set the reloc control before we've reserved our space for relocation we
could race with a root being dirtied and not actually have space to do our init
reloc root.  So once we've allocated it and set it up go ahead and make our
reservation before setting the relocate control, that way anybody who tries to
do the reloc root init has space to use.  Thanks,
