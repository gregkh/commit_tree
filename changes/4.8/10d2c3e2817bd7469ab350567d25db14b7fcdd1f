drm/i915/guc: move guc_ring_doorbell() nearer to callsite

Just code movement, no actual change to the function. This is in
preparation for the next patch, which will reorganise all the other
doorbell code, but doesn't change this function. So let's shuffle it
down near its caller rather than leaving it mixed in with the setup
code. Unlike the doorbell management code, this function is somewhat
time-critical, so putting it near its caller may even yield a tiny
performance improvement.
