cfq-iosched: Fix regression in bonnie++ rewrite performance

Commit 9a7f38c42c2 (cfq-iosched: Convert from jiffies to nanoseconds)
broke the condition for detecting starved sync IO in
cfq_completed_request() because rq->start_time remained in jiffies but
we compared it with nanosecond values. This manifested as a regression
in bonnie++ rewrite performance because we always ended up considering
sync IO starved and thus never increased async IO queue depth.

Since rq->start_time is used in a lot of places, converting it to ns
values would be non-trivial. So just revert the condition in CFQ to use
comparison with jiffies. This will lead to suboptimal results if
cfq_fifo_expire[1] will ever come close to 1 jiffie but so far we are
relatively far from that with the storage used with CFQ (the default
value is 128 ms).
