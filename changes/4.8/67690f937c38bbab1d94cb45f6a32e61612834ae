userns: Remove implicit MNT_NODEV fragility.

Replace the implict setting of MNT_NODEV on mounts that happen with
just user namespace permissions with an implicit setting of SB_I_NODEV
in s_iflags.  The visibility of the implicit MNT_NODEV has caused
problems in the past.

With this change the fragile case where an implicit MNT_NODEV needs to
be preserved in do_remount is removed.  Using SB_I_NODEV is much less
fragile as s_iflags are set during the original mount and never
changed.

In do_new_mount with the implicit setting of MNT_NODEV gone, the only
code that can affect mnt_flags is fs_fully_visible so simplify the if
statement and reduce the indentation of the code to make that clear.
