rtc: m68k: provide rtc_class_ops directly

The rtc-generic driver provides an architecture specific
wrapper on top of the generic rtc_class_ops abstraction,
and m68k has another abstraction on top, which is a bit
silly.

This changes the m68k rtc-generic device to provide its
rtc_class_ops directly, to reduce the number of layers
by one.
