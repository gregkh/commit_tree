NFS: Don't call COMMIT in ->releasepage()

While COMMIT has the potential to free up a lot of memory that is being
taken by unstable writes, it isn't guaranteed to free up this particular
page. Also, calling fsync() on the server is expensive and so we want to
do it in a more controlled fashion, rather than have it triggered at
random by the VM.
