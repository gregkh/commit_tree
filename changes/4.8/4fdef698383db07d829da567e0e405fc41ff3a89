usb: renesas_usbhs: fix NULL pointer dereference in xfer_work()

This patch fixes an issue that the xfer_work() is possible to cause
NULL pointer dereference if the usb cable is disconnected while data
transfer is running.

In such case, a gadget driver may call usb_ep_disable()) before
xfer_work() is actually called. In this case, the usbhs_pkt_pop()
will call usbhsf_fifo_unselect(), and then usbhs_pipe_to_fifo()
in xfer_work() will return NULL.
