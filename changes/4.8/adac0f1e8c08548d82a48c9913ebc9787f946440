s390/topology: add drawer scheduling domain level

The z13 machine added a fourth level to the cpu topology
information. The new top level is called drawer.

A drawer contains two books, which used to be the top level.

Adding this additional scheduling domain did show performance
improvements for some workloads of up to 8%, while there don't
seem to be any workloads impacted in a negative way.
