drm/atomic-helper: use for_each_*_in_state more

This avois leaking drm_atomic_state internals into the helpers. The
only place where this still happens after this patch is drm_atomic_helper_swap_state().
It's unavoidable there, and maybe a good indicator we should actually
move that function into drm_atomic.c.
