drm/i915: Bump reserved size for legacy gen8 semaphore emission

With 5 rings and a flush, we need 192 bytes of space to emit the
breadcrumb and semaphores. However, we need some spare room the size of
the single largest packet (36 dwords, 144 bytes) to accommodate
wraparound giving a grand total of 336 bytes
