tools: Work around BITS_PER_LONG related build failure in objtool

The objtool build fails with the recent changes to the bits-per-long
headers:

  tools/include/linux/bitops.h:12:0: error: "BITS_PER_LONG" redefined [-Werror]

Which got introduced by:

  bb9707077b4e tools: Copy the bitsperlong.h files from the kernel

Work it around for the time being.
