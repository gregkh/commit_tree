rxrpc: Fix processing of authenticated/encrypted jumbo packets

When a jumbo packet is being split up and processed, the crypto checksum
for each split-out packet is in the jumbo header and needs placing in the
reconstructed packet header.

When the code was changed to keep the stored copy of the packet header in
host byte order, this reconstruction was missed.

Found with sparse with CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__:

    ../net/rxrpc/input.c:479:33: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
    ../net/rxrpc/input.c:479:33:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] _rsvd
    ../net/rxrpc/input.c:479:33:    got restricted __be16 [addressable] [usertype] _rsvd

Fixes: 0d12f8a4027d021c9cc942f09f38d28288020c5d ("rxrpc: Keep the skb private record of the Rx header in host byte order")
