tty/serial: atmel: enforce tasklet init and termination sequences

As some race conditions are identified in the termination process of tasklets,
enforce the atmel_shutdown() sequence. This way we make sure that no new
tasklets or software timer are scheduled during shutdown process.

An atomic flag is positioned to give this information throughout the code.

We also remove tasklet_disable() calls that were leading to deadlocks while
stopping the driver. A simpler init/kill sequence is used.
