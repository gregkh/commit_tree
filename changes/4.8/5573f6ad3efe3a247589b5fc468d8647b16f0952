MIPS: Print segment physical address when EU=1

Currently the debugfs interface to print the segment configuration
refuses to print the physical address of mapped segments. However if the
EU bit is set these become unmapped at error level (when
CP0_Status.ERL=1), so the physical address is still relevant.

Update the logic to print the physical address of mapped segments when
the EU bit is set, while still hiding the Cache Coherency Attribute
(since EU overrides that to uncached when ERL=1 too).
