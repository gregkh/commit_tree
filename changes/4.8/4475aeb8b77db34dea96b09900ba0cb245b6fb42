s390/cio: fix premature wakeup during chp configure

We store requests for channel path configure operations in an array but
maintain an additional cfg_busy variable (indicating if we have requests
stored in said array). When 2 tasks request a channel path configure
operation cfg_busy could be set to 0 even if we still have unprocessed
requests. This would lead to the second task being woken up although its
request was not processed yet.

Fix that by getting rid of cfg_busy and use the chp_cfg_task array
in the wake up condition.
