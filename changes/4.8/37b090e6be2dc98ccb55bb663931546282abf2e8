net: bridge: remove _deliver functions and consolidate forward code

Before this patch we had two flavors of most forwarding functions -
_forward and _deliver, the difference being that the latter are used
when the packets are locally originated. Instead of all this function
pointer passing and code duplication, we can just pass a boolean noting
that the packet was locally originated and use that to perform the
necessary checks in __br_forward. This gives a minor performance
improvement but more importantly consolidates the forwarding paths.
Also add a kernel doc comment to explain the exported br_forward()'s
arguments.
