cpufreq: powernv: Replacing pstate_id with frequency table index

Refactoring code to use frequency table index instead of pstate_id.
This abstraction will make the code independent of the pstate values.

- No functional changes
- The highest frequency is at frequency table index 0 and the frequency
  decreases as the index increases.
- Macros pstates_to_idx() and idx_to_pstate() can be used for conversion
  between pstate_id and index.
- powernv_pstate_info now contains frequency table index to min, max and
  nominal frequency (instead of pstate_ids)
- global_pstate_info new stores index values instead pstate ids.
- variables renamed as *_idx which now store index instead of pstate
