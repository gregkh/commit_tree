ASoC: sgtl5000: Write all default registers

If an error occurs writing defaults, produce an error message but
continue writing other registers. The failure of a single write should
not cause catastrophic device failure.

In at least one occurrence, I2C writes of CHIP_ANA_POWER were nacked,
though continuing allowed the device to operate properly.
