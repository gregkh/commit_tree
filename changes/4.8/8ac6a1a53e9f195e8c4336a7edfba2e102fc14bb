[media] cec-edid: check for IEEE identifier

The cec_get_edid_spa_location() function did not verify that the IEEE
identifier in the Vendor Specific Data Block matched the HDMI-LLC
identifier. This could result in the wrong VSDB block being returned.

For example, for HDMI 2.0 EDIDs there is also a HDMI Forum VSDB.

So check the IEEE identifier as well.
