ARM: dts: rockchip: rename i2s model for Veyron devices

Commit 6c42db30d8c8 introduced audio support based on alsa ucm profiles
taken from the ChromeOS userspace. Both in the kernel as well as alsa
they were named (and matched against) ROCKCHIP-I2S. Audio profiles are
very much board-specific and hogging the ROCKCHIP-I2S name would make
it harder for future boards and also is misleading.

For Veyron boards the audio setup is similar over all variants, so
VEYRON-I2S is a more suitable name. This rename also was merged into
the alsa ucm profile so both userspace and kernel match and the old
naming was never released in any alsa or kernel release.
