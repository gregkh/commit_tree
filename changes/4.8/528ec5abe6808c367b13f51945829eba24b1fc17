dm: pass dm stats data dir instead of bi_rw

It looks like dm stats cares about the data direction
(READ vs WRITE) and does not need the bio/request flags.
Commands like REQ_FLUSH, REQ_DISCARD and REQ_WRITE_SAME
are currently always set with REQ_WRITE, so the extra check for
REQ_DISCARD in dm_stats_account_io is not needed.

This patch has it use the bio and request data_dir helpers
instead of accessing the bi_rw/cmd_flags directly. This makes
the next patches that remove the operation from the cmd_flags
and bi_rw easier, because we will no longer have the REQ_WRITE
bit set for operations like discards.
