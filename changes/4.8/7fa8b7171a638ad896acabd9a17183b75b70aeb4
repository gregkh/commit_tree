tracing/function_graph: Fix filters for function_graph threshold

Function graph tracer currently ignores filters if tracing_thresh is set.
For example, even if set_ftrace_pid is set, then its ignored if tracing_thresh
set, resulting in all processes being traced.

To fix this, we reuse the same entry function as when tracing_thresh is not
set and do everything as in the regular case except for writing the function entry
to the ring buffer.
