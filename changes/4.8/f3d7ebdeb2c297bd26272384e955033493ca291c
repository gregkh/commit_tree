xfs: fix superblock inprogress check

From inspection, the superblock sb_inprogress check is done in the
verifier and triggered only for the primary superblock via a
"bp->b_bn == XFS_SB_DADDR" check.

Unfortunately, the primary superblock is an uncached buffer, and
hence it is configured by xfs_buf_read_uncached() with:

	bp->b_bn = XFS_BUF_DADDR_NULL;  /* always null for uncached buffers */

And so this check never triggers. Fix it.
