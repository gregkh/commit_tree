drivers: net: davinci_mdio: drop suspended and lock fields from mdio_data

It's not expected Davinci MDIO to be accessible after its suspend
callbacks have been called:
 - all consumers of Davinci MDIO will stop/disconnect phys at Device
suspend stage;
 - all phys are expected to be suspned already by PHY/MDIO core;
 - MDIO locking is done by MDIO Bus code.

Hence, it's safe to drop "suspended" and "lock" fields from mdio_data.
