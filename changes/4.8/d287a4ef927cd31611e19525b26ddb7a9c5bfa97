[media] rtl28xxu: auto-select more DVB-frontends and tuners

This adds the missing auto-select bits for DVB-frontends and tuners
(if MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT is enabled) which are used by the various
rtl28xxu devices.
The driver itself probes for three more tuners, but it's not actually
using any of them:
- MEDIA_TUNER_MT2063
- MEDIA_TUNER_MT2266
- MEDIA_TUNER_MXL5007T
