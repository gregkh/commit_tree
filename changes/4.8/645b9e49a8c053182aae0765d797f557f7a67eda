irqchip/gic-v3: Refactor and add GICv3 definitions

arm-gic-v3.h contains bit and register definitions for the GICv3 and ITS,
at least for the bits the we currently care about.
The ITS emulation needs more definitions, so add them and refactor
the memory attribute #defines to be more universally usable.
To avoid changing all users, we still provide some of the old definitons
defined with the help of the new macros.
