tools lib fd array: Allow associating a pointer cookie with each entry

Add a 'ptr' field to fdarray->priv array.

This feature will be used by following commits, which introduce
muiltiple 'struct perf_mmap' arrays for different types of mapping.

Because of this, during fdarray__filter(), a simple 'idx' is not enough.

Add a pointer cookie that allows to directly associate a 'struct
perf_mmap' pointer to an fdarray entry.
