[media] tw686x: Add support for DMA contiguous interlaced frame mode

Now that the driver has the infrastructure to support more
DMA modes, let's add the DMA contiguous interlaced frame mode.

In this mode, the DMA P and B buffers are programmed with
the user-provided buffers. When a P (or B) frame is ready,
a new buffer is dequeued into P (or B).

In addition to interlaced fields, the device can also be
programmed to deliver alternate fields. Only interlaced
mode is supported for now.
