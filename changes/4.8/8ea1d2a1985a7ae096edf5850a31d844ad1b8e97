mm, frontswap: convert frontswap_enabled to static key

I have noticed that frontswap.h first declares "frontswap_enabled" as
extern bool variable, and then overrides it with "#define
frontswap_enabled (1)" for CONFIG_FRONTSWAP=Y or (0) when disabled.  The
bool variable isn't actually instantiated anywhere.

This all looks like an unfinished attempt to make frontswap_enabled
reflect whether a backend is instantiated.  But in the current state,
all frontswap hooks call unconditionally into frontswap.c just to check
if frontswap_ops is non-NULL.  This should at least be checked inline,
but we can further eliminate the overhead when CONFIG_FRONTSWAP is
enabled and no backend registered, using a static key that is initially
disabled, and gets enabled only upon first backend registration.

Thus, checks for "frontswap_enabled" are replaced with
"frontswap_enabled()" wrapping the static key check.  There are two
exceptions:

- xen's selfballoon_process() was testing frontswap_enabled in code guarded
  by #ifdef CONFIG_FRONTSWAP, which was effectively always true when reachable.
  The patch just removes this check. Using frontswap_enabled() does not sound
  correct here, as this can be true even without xen's own backend being
  registered.

- in SYSCALL_DEFINE2(swapon), change the check to IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FRONTSWAP)
  as it seems the bitmap allocation cannot currently be postponed until a
  backend is registered. This means that frontswap will still have some
  memory overhead by being configured, but without a backend.

After the patch, we can expect that some functions in frontswap.c are
called only when frontswap_ops is non-NULL.  Change the checks there to
VM_BUG_ONs.  While at it, convert other BUG_ONs to VM_BUG_ONs as
frontswap has been stable for some time.
