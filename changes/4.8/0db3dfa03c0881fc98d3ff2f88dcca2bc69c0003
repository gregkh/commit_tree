IB/hfi1: Work request processing for fast register mr and invalidate

In order to support extended memory management support, add send side
processing of work requests of type IB_WR_REG_MR, IB_WR_LOCAL_INV, and
IB_WR_SEND_WITH_INV. The first two are local operations and are supported
for both RC and UC. Send with invalidate is only supported for RC because
the corresponding IB opcodes are not defined for UC.
