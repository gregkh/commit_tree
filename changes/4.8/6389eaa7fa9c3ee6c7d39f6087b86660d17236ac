net/ncsi: NCSI command packet handler

The NCSI command packets are sent from MC (Management Controller)
to remote end. They are used for multiple purposes: probe existing
NCSI package/channel, retrieve NCSI channel's capability, configure
NCSI channel etc.

This defines struct to represent NCSI command packets and introduces
function ncsi_xmit_cmd(), which will be used to transmit NCSI command
packet according to the request. The request is represented by struct
ncsi_cmd_arg.
