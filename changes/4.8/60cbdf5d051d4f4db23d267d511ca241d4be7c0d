tools build: Fix objtool build with ARCH=x86_64

The objtool build fails in a cross-compiled environment on a non-x86
host with "ARCH=x86_64":

  tools/objtool/objtool-in.o: In function `decode_instructions':
  tools/objtool/builtin-check.c:276: undefined reference to `arch_decode_instruction'

We could override the ARCH environment variable and change it back to
x86, similar to what the objtool Makefile was doing before; but it's
tricky to override environment variables consistently.

Instead, take a similar approach used by the Linux top-level Makefile
and introduce a SRCARCH Makefile variable which evaluates to "x86" when
ARCH is either "x86_64" or "x86".
