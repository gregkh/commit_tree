mmc: sdhci-msm: Do not reset the controller if no card in the slot

The controller does not clear the "reset bit" when it is reset without
a card in the slot. Because of this, the following error message is seen
while booting with no plugged SD card.

mmc1: Reset 0x1 never completed.

Add the SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_NO_RESET quirk to avoid this.
