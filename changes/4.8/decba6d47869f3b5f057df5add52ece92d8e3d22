mtd: brcmnand: Add v7.2 controller support

The 7.2 controller differs in a few area compared to its predecssor (7.1):

- NAND scrambler, which we are not using just yet
- higher ECC levels (up to 120 bits) per 1KB data blocks, also not supported yet
- up to 128B OOB

This patch adds the necessary code to support such a controller
generation and updates the Device Tree binding.
