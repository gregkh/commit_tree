mmc: mmc: do not use CMD13 to get status after speed mode switch

Per JEDEC spec, it is not recommended to use CMD13 to get card status
after speed mode switch. below are two reason about this:
1. CMD13 cannot be guaranteed due to the asynchronous operation.
Therefore it is not recommended to use CMD13 to check busy completion
of the timing change indication.
2. After switch to HS200, CMD13 will get response of 0x800, and even the
busy signal gets de-asserted, the response of CMD13 is aslo 0x800.
