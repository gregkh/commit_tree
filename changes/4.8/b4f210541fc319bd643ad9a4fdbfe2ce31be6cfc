i2c: add a protocol parameter to the alert callback

.alert() is meant to be generic, but there is currently no way
for the device driver to know which protocol generated the alert.
Add a parameter in .alert() to help the device driver to understand
what is given in data.

This patch is required to have the support of SMBus Host Notify protocol
through .alert().
