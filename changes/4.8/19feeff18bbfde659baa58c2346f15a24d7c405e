printk/nmi: avoid direct printk()-s from __printk_nmi_flush()

__printk_nmi_flush() can be called from nmi_panic(), therefore it has to
test whether it's executed in NMI context and thus must route the
messages through deferred printk() or via direct printk().

This is to avoid potential deadlocks, as described in commit
cf9b1106c81c ("printk/nmi: flush NMI messages on the system panic").

However there remain two places where __printk_nmi_flush() does
unconditional direct printk() calls:

 - pr_err("printk_nmi_flush: internal error ...")
 - pr_cont("\n")

Factor out print_nmi_seq_line() parts into a new printk_nmi_flush_line()
function, which takes care of in_nmi(), and use it in
__printk_nmi_flush() for printing and error-reporting.
