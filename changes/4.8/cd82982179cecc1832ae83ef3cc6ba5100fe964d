[media] ascot2e: Fix I2C message size check

Tuning a card with Sony ASCOT2E produces the following error:

	kernel: i2c i2c-9: wr reg=0006: len=11 is too big!

MAX_WRITE_REGSIZE is defined as 10, buf[MAX_WRITE_REGSIZE + 1] buffer is
used in ascot2e_write_regs().

The problem is that exactly 10 bytes are written in ascot2e_set_params():

	/* Set BW_OFFSET (0x0F) value from parameter table */
	data[9] = ascot2e_sett[tv_system].bw_offset;
	ascot2e_write_regs(priv, 0x06, data, 10);

The test in write_regs is as follows:

	if (len + 1 >= sizeof(buf))

10 + 1 = 11 and that would be exactly the size of buf. Since 10 bytes +
buf[0] = reg would seem to fit into buf[], this shouldn't be an error.
