drm/i915: Replace lockless_dereference(bool) with READ_ONCE()

After Joonas complained about using READ_ONCE() on the only use of the
variable in the function, where the intent was to simply document that
the read was intentionally racy and unlocked, I switched the READ_ONCE()
over to lockless_dereference(). However, in linux-next that has a
stronger type-check to only allow pointers and is no longer
interchangeable with READ_ONCE(), see commit 331b6d8c7afc
("locking/barriers: Validate lockless_dereference() is used on a pointer
type")
