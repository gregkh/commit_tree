x86/power/64: Do not refer to __PAGE_OFFSET from assembly code

When CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY is set on x86-64, __PAGE_OFFSET becomes
a variable and using it as a symbol in the image memory restoration
assembly code under core_restore_code is not correct any more.

To avoid that problem, modify set_up_temporary_mappings() to compute
the physical address of the temporary page tables and store it in
temp_level4_pgt, so that the value of that variable is ready to be
written into CR3.  Then, the assembly code doesn't have to worry
about converting that value into a physical address and things work
regardless of whether or not CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY is set.
