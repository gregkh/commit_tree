drivers/perf: arm-pmu: Handle per-interrupt affinity mask

On a big-little system, PMUs can be wired to CPUs using per CPU
interrups (PPI). In this case, it is important to make sure that
the enable/disable do happen on the right set of CPUs.

So instead of relying on the interrupt-affinity property, we can
use the actual percpu affinity that DT exposes as part of the
interrupt specifier. The DT binding is also updated to reflect
the fact that the interrupt-affinity property shouldn't be used
in that case.
