powerpc/powernv: Extend PCI bridge resources

The PCI slots are associated with root port or downstream ports
of the PCIe switch connected to root port. When adapter is hot
added to the PCI slot, it usually requests more IO or memory
resource from the directly connected parent bridge (port) and
update the bridge's windows accordingly. The resource windows
of upstream bridges can't be updated automatically. It possibly
leads to unbalanced resource across the bridges: The window of
downstream bridge is overruning that of upstream bridge. The
IO or MMIO path won't work.

This resolves the above issue by extending bridge windows of
root port and upstream port of the PCIe switch connected to
the root port to PHB's windows.

The windows of root port and bridge behind that are extended to
the PHB's windows to accomodate the PCI hotplug happening in
future. The PHB's 64KB 32-bits MSI region is included in bridge's
M32 windows (in hardware) though it's excluded in the corresponding
resource, as the bridge's M32 windows have 1MB as their minimal
alignment. We observed EEH error during system boot when the MSI
region is included in bridge's M32 window.

This excludes top 1MB (including 64KB 32-bits MSI region) region
from bridge's M32 windows when extending them.
