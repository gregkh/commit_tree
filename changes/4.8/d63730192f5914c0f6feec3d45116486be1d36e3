IB/hfi1: Reserve and collapse CPU cores for contexts

Kernel receive queues oversubscribe CPU cores on multi-HFI systems.
To prevent this, the kernel receive queues are separated onto
different cores, and the SDMA engine interrupts are constrained to
a lesser number of cores.

hfi1s_on_numa_node*krcvqs is the number of CPU cores that are
reserved for kernel receive queues for all HFIs. Each HFI initializes
its kernel receive queues to one of the reserved CPU cores. If there
ends up being 0 CPU cores leftover for SDMA engines, use the same
CPU cores as receive contexts.

In addition, general and control contexts are assigned to their own
CPU core, however, both types of contexts tend to have low traffic.
To save CPU cores, collapse general and control contexts to one CPU
core for all HFI units. This change prevents SDMA engine interrupts
from wrapping around general contexts.
