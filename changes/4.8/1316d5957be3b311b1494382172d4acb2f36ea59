iwlwifi: pcie: workaround HW shadow registers bug

Integrated 9000 devices have a bug with shadow registers
value retention.
If driver writes RBD registers while MAC is asleep the
values are stored in shadow registers to be copied whenever
MAC wakes up.
However, in 9000 devices a MAC wakeup is not triggered
and when the bus powers down due to inactivity the shadow
values and dirty bits are lost.
Turn on the chicken-bits that cause MAC wakeup for RX-related
values as well when the device is in D0.
When the device is in low power mode turn the RX wakeup chicken
bits off since driver is idle and this W/A is not needed.
Remove previous W/A which was ineffective.
