pinctrl: cherryview: prevent concurrent access to GPIO controllers

Due to a silicon issue on the Atom X5-Z8000 "Cherry Trail" processor
series, a common lock must be used to prevent concurrent accesses
across the 4 GPIO controllers managed by this driver.

See Intel Atom Z8000 Processor Series Specification Update
(Rev. 005), errata #CHT34, for further information.
