net: hns: bug fix about led control logic when link down

The default driver sets anchor led bit to 0 when link down,
actually, the anchor bit should be set to 1, so fixes it when
link status is down.
Secondly, change the return value of cpld_set_led_id to 0, which
means leave the cpld to control led blink frequece other than the
driver itself.
