tpm: Provide strong locking for device removal

Add a read/write semaphore around the ops function pointers so
ops can be set to null when the driver un-registers.

Previously the tpm core expected module locking to be enough to
ensure that tpm_unregister could not be called during certain times,
however that hasn't been sufficient for a long time.

Introduce a read/write semaphore around 'ops' so the core can set
it to null when unregistering. This provides a strong fence around
the driver callbacks, guaranteeing to the driver that no callbacks
are running or will run again.

For now the ops_lock is placed very high in the call stack, it could
be pushed down and made more granular in future if necessary.
