IB/rdmavt: Eliminate redundant opcode test in mr ref clear

The use of the specific opcode test is redundant since
all ack entry users correctly manipulate the mr pointer
to selectively trigger the reference clearing.

The overly specific test hinders the use of implementation
specific operations.

The change needs to get rid of the union to insure that
an atomic value is not seen as an MR pointer.
