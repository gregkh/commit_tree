brcmfmac: restore stopping netdev queue when bus clogs up

When the host-interface bus has hard time handling transmit packets
it informs higher layer about this and it would stop the netdev
queue when needed. However, since commit 9cd18359d31e ("brcmfmac:
Make FWS queueing configurable.") this was broken. With this patch
the behaviour is restored.
