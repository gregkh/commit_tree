block: remove BLK_DEV_DAX config option

The functionality for block device DAX was already removed with commit
acc93d30d7d4 ("Revert "block: enable dax for raw block devices"")

However, we still had a config option hanging around that was always
disabled because it depended on CONFIG_BROKEN.  This config option was
introduced in commit 03cdadb04077 ("block: disable block device DAX by
default")

This change reverts that commit, removing the dead config option.
