[media] rc: nuvoton: fix hang if chip is configured for alternative EFM IO address

If a system configures the Nuvoton chip to use the alternative
EFM IO address (CR_EFIR2) then after probing the primary EFM IO
address (CR_EFIR) this region is not released.

If a driver for another function of the Nuvoton Super I/O
chip uses the same probing mechanism then it will hang if
loaded after the nuvoton-cir driver.
This was reported for the nct6775 hwmon driver.

Fix this by properly releasing the region after probing CR_EFIR.
This regression was introduced with kernel 4.6 so cc it to stable.
