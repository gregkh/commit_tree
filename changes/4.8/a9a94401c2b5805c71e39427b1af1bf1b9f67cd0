perf/x86/intel/bts: Fix confused ordering of PMU callbacks

The intel_bts driver is using a CPU-local 'started' variable to order
callbacks and PMIs and make sure that AUX transactions don't get messed
up. However, the ordering rules in regard to this variable is a complete
mess, which recently resulted in perf_fuzzer-triggered warnings and
panics.

The general ordering rule that is patch is enforcing is that this
cpu-local variable be set only when the cpu-local AUX transaction is
active; consequently, this variable is to be checked before the AUX
related bits can be touched.
