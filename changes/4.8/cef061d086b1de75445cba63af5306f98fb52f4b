MIPS: KVM: Allow ULRI to restrict UserLocal register

The ULRI bit in Config3 specifies whether the UserLocal register is
implemented, but it is assumed to always be set. Now that the Config
registers can be modified by userland, allow Config3.ULRI to be cleared
and check ULRI before allowing the corresponding bit to be set in
HWREna.

In fact any HWREna bits corresponding to unimplemented RDHWR registers
should read as zero and be ignored on write, so we actually prevent
other unimplemented bits being set too.
