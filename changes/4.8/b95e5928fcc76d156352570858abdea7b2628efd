openvswitch: Add packet len info to upcall.

The commit f2a4d086ed4c ("openvswitch: Add packet truncation support.")
introduces packet truncation before sending to userspace upcall receiver.
This patch passes up the skb->len before truncation so that the upcall
receiver knows the original packet size. Potentially this will be used
by sFlow, where OVS translates sFlow config header=N to a sample action,
truncating packet to N byte in kernel datapath. Thus, only N bytes instead
of full-packet size is copied from kernel to userspace, saving the
kernel-to-userspace bandwidth.
