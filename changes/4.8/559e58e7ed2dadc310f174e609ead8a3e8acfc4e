mtd: nand: fix chances to create incomplete ECC data when writing

When mtk_nfc_do_write_page() comparing the sector number,because the
sector number field is at the 12th-bit position of NFI_BYTELEN
register,the masked register should be shifted 12 bits before being
compared.The result of this bug may cause the second subpage has
incomplete ECC parity bytes.
