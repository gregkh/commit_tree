pstore: Enable compression on normal path (again)

The commit f0e2efcfd2717 ("pstore: do not use message compression
without lock") added a check to 'is_locked' to avoid breakage in
concurrent accesses.  But it has a side-effect of disabling compression
on normal path since 'is_locked' variable is not set.  As normal path
always takes the lock, it should be initialized to 1.

This also makes the unlock code a bit simpler.
