blk-mq: actually hook up defer list when running requests

If ->queue_rq() returns BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_OK, we use continue and skip
over the rest of the loop body. However, dptr is assigned later in the
loop body, and the BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_OK case is exactly the case that we'd
want it for.

NVMe isn't actually using BLK_MQ_F_DEFER_ISSUE yet, nor is any other
in-tree driver, but if the code's going to be there, it might as well
work.
