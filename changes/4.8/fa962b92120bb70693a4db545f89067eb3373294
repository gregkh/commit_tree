mac80211: implement fair queueing per txq

mac80211's software queues were designed to work
very closely with device tx queues. They are
required to make use of 802.11 packet aggregation
easily and efficiently.

Due to the way 802.11 aggregation is designed it
only makes sense to keep fair queuing as close to
hardware as possible to reduce induced latency and
inertia and provide the best flow responsiveness.

This change doesn't translate directly to
immediate and significant gains. End result
depends on driver's induced latency. Best results
can be achieved if driver keeps its own tx
queue/fifo fill level to a minimum.
