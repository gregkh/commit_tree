ASoC: Intel: cht: fix uninit variable warning

Kbuild bot reports that we might use dai_index uninitialized.

sound/soc/intel/boards/cht_bsw_rt5645.c:391:37: warning: 'dai_index' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Since it is theoretically possible, set it while initializing.
