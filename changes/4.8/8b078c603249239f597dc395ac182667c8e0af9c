PCI: Update "pci=resource_alignment" documentation

Some uio based PCI drivers, e.g., uio_cif, do not work if the assigned PCI
memory resources are not page aligned.  By using the kernel option
"pci=resource_alignment=<align>@<bus>:<slot>.<func>" it is possible to
request page alignment for memory resources of devices.

However, this is cumbersome when using several devices, and the
bus/slot/func addresses may change if devices are added to or removed from
the system.

Extend the "pci=resource_alignment" option so we can specify the relevant
devices via PCI vendor, device, subvendor, and subdevice IDs.  The
specification of the devices via IDs is indicated by a leading string
"pci:" as argument to "pci=resource_alignment".

The format of the specification is
  pci:<vendor>:<device>[:<subvendor>:<subdevice>]

Examples:
  pci=resource_alignment=4096@pci:8086:9c22:103c:198f
  pci=resource_alignment=pci:8086:9c22       # defaults to PAGE_SIZE align
