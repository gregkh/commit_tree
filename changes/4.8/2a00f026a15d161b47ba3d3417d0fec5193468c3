tools: Fix up BITS_PER_LONG setting

It was set based on CONFIG_64BIT, that is available only when using
Kconfig, which we're working towards but not to the point of having this
CONFIG variable set, so synthesize it from available compiler defined
defines, __SIZEOF_LONG__ or, lacking that, __WORDSIZE.
