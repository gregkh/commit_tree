fs: Call d_automount with the filesystems creds

Seth Forshee reported a mount regression in nfs autmounts
with "fs: Add user namespace member to struct super_block".

It turns out that the assumption that current->cred is something
reasonable during mount while necessary to improve support of
unprivileged mounts is wrong in the automount path.

To fix the existing filesystems override current->cred with the
init_cred before calling d_automount and restore current->cred after
d_automount completes.

To support unprivileged mounts would require a more nuanced cred
selection, so fail on unprivileged mounts for the time being.  As none
of the filesystems that currently set FS_USERNS_MOUNT implement
d_automount this check is only good for preventing future problems.
