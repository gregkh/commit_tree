nfsd: Make creates return EEXIST instead of EACCES

When doing a create (mkdir/mknod) on a name, it's worth
checking the name exists first before returning EACCES in case
the directory is not writeable by the user.
This makes return values on the client more consistent
regardless of whenever the entry there is cached in the local
cache or not.
Another positive side effect is certain programs only expect
EEXIST in that case even despite POSIX allowing any valid
error to be returned.
