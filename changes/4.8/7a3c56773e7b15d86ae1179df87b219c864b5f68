mmc: dw_mmc: Consider HLE errors to be data and command errors

The dw_mmc driver enables HLE errors as part of DW_MCI_ERROR_FLAGS but
nothing in the interrupt handler actually handles them and ACKs them.
That means that if we ever get an HLE error we'll just keep getting
interrupts and we'll wedge things.

We really don't expect HLE errors but if we ever get them we shouldn't
silently ignore them.

Note that I have seen HLE errors while constantly ejecting and
inserting cards (ejecting while inserting, etc).
