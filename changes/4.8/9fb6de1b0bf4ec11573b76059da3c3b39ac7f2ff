Input: joydev - recognize devices with Z axis as joysticks

Current implementation of joydev's input_device_id table recognizes only
devices with ABS_X, ABS_WHEEL or ABS_THROTTLE axes as joysticks.

There are joystick devices that do not have those axes, for example TRC
Rudder device. The device in question has ABS_Z, ABS_RX and ABS_RY axes
causing it not being detected as joystick.

This patch adds ABS_Z to the input_device_id list allowing devices with
ABS_Z axis to be detected correctly.
