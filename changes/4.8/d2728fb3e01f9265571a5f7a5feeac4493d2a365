usb: dwc3: omap: Pass VBUS and ID events transparently

Don't make any decisions regarding VBUS session based on ID
status. That is best left to the OTG core.

Pass ID and VBUS events independent of each other so that OTG
core knows exactly what to do.

This makes dual-role with extcon work with OTG irq on OMAP platforms.
