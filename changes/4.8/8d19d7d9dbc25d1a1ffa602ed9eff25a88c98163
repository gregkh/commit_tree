drm/i915/skl+: Use scaling amount for plane data rate calculation (v4)

if downscaling is enabled plane data rate increases according to scaling
amount. take scaling amount under consideration while calculating plane
data rate

v2: Address Matt's comments, where data rate was overridden because of
missing else.

v3 (by Matt):
 - Add braces to 'else' branch to match kernel coding style
 - Adjust final calculation now that skl_plane_downscale_amount()
   returns 16.16 fixed point value instead of a decimal fixed point

v4 (by Matt):
 - Avoid integer overflow by making sure final multiplication is
   treated as 64-bit.
