drm/i915: Rename struct intel_context

Our goal is to rename the anonymous per-engine struct beneath the
current intel_context. However, after a lively debate resolving around
the confusion between intel_context_engine and intel_engine_context, the
realisation is that the two structs target different users. The outer
struct is API / user facing, and so carries the higher level GEM
information. The inner struct is hw facing. Thus we want to name the
inner struct intel_context and the outer one i915_gem_context. As the
first step, we need to rename the current struct:

	s/struct intel_context/struct i915_gem_context/

which fits much better with its constructors already conveying the
i915_gem_context prefix!
