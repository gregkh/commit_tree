crypto: rsa-pkcs1pad - Require hash to be present

The only user of rsa-pkcs1pad always uses the hash so there is
no reason to support the case of not having a hash.

This patch also changes the digest info lookup so that it is
only done once during template instantiation rather than on each
operation.
