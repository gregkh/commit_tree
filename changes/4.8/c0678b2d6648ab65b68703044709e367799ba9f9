include/linux: fix excess fence.h kernel-doc notation

Fix excess fields in kernel-doc notation in <linux/fence.h>
after some struct fields were removed.

Fixes these kernel-doc warnings:
..//include/linux/fence.h:85: warning: Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'child_list' description in 'fence'
..//include/linux/fence.h:85: warning: Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'active_list' description in 'fence'
