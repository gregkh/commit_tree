dm rq: fix the starting and stopping of blk-mq queues

Improve dm_stop_queue() to cancel any requeue_work.  Also, have
dm_start_queue() and dm_stop_queue() clear/set the QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED
for the blk-mq request_queue.

On suspend dm_stop_queue() handles stopping the blk-mq request_queue
BUT: even though the hw_queues are marked BLK_MQ_S_STOPPED at that point
there is still a race that is allowing block/blk-mq.c to call ->queue_rq
against a hctx that it really shouldn't.  Add a check to
dm_mq_queue_rq() that guards against this rarity (albeit _not_
race-free).
