ASoC: fix ABE_TWL6040 dependency

The TWL6040 ASoC support has recently started turning on CLK_TWL6040,
but that fails to build when CONFIG_COMMON_CLK is disabled:

warning: (SND_OMAP_SOC_OMAP_ABE_TWL6040) selects CLK_TWL6040 which has unmet direct dependencies (COMMON_CLK && TWL6040_CORE)

        .data = (fn == (fn_type)NULL) ? fn : fn  }
                    ^

This adds a dependency to avoid the invalid configuration.
