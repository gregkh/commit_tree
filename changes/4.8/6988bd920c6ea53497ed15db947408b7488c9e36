bnxt_en: Add new function bnxt_reset().

When a default VLAN is added to the VF, the VF driver needs to reset to
pick up the default VLAN ID.  We can use the same tx timeout reset logic
to do that, without the debug output.  This new function, with the
silent parameter to suppress debug output will now serve both purposes.
