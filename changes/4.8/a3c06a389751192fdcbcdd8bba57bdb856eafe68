dm raid: enhance attempt_restore_of_faulty_devices() to support more devices

attempt_restore_of_faulty_devices() is limited to 64 when it should support
the new maximum of 253 when identifying any failed devices. It clears any
revivable devices via an MD personality hot remove and add cylce to allow
for their recovery.

Address by using existing functions to retrieve and update all failed
devices' bitfield members in the dm raid superblocks on all RAID devices
and check for any devices to clear in it.

Whilst on it, don't call attempt_restore_of_faulty_devices() for any MD
personality not providing disk hot add/remove methods (i.e. raid0 now),
because such personalities don't support reviving of failed disks.
