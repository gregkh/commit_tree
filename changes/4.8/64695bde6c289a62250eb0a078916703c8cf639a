xprtrdma: Clean up fixup_copy_count accounting

fixup_copy_count should count only the number of bytes copied to the
page list. The head and tail are now always handled without a data
copy.

And the debugging at the end of rpcrdma_inline_fixup() is also no
longer necessary, since copy_len will be non-zero when there is reply
data in the tail (a normal and valid case).
