dm raid: don't use 'const' in function return

A newly introduced function has 'const int' as the return type,
but as "make W=1" reports, that has no meaning:

drivers/md/dm-raid.c:510:18: error: type qualifiers ignored on function return type [-Werror=ignored-qualifiers]

This changes the return type to plain 'int'.
