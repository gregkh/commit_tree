mm: silently skip readahead for DAX inodes

For DAX inodes we need to be careful to never have page cache pages in
the mapping->page_tree.  This radix tree should be composed only of DAX
exceptional entries and zero pages.

ltp's readahead02 test was triggering a warning because we were trying
to insert a DAX exceptional entry but found that a page cache page had
already been inserted into the tree.  This page was being inserted into
the radix tree in response to a readahead(2) call.

Readahead doesn't make sense for DAX inodes, but we don't want it to
report a failure either.  Instead, we just return success and don't do
any work.
