nfit, libnvdimm: allow an ARS scrub to be triggered on demand

Normally, an ARS (Address Range Scrub) only happens at
boot/initialization time. There can however arise situations where a
bus-wide rescan is needed - notably, in the case of discovering a latent
media error, we should do a full rescan to figure out what other sectors
are bad, and thus potentially avoid triggering an mce on them in the
future. Also provide a sysfs trigger to start a bus-wide scrub.
