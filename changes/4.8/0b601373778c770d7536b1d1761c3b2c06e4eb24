s390/cio: make fmt1 channel path descriptor optional

Not all machines / hypervisors support the chsc commands to fetch
the fmt1 descriptor. When these commands fail the channel path would
currently not be available to linux.

Since users of these descriptors can already deal with invalid data
make fetching it optional. The only data that is mandatory for us is
the fmt0 channel path descriptor.

Also make the return code for missing facilities in
chsc_get_channel_measurement_chars consistent to other functions.
