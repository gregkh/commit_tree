i2c: rk3x: Change SoC data to not use array

Specifying the i2c SoC data in an array provides very little benefit and
gets unwieldly / confusing as the array grows since the next bit of code
needs to refer to elements in the array by their raw integral index.

Let's just create a single 'static const' structure for each SoC so that
we can refer to these structures by ID.
