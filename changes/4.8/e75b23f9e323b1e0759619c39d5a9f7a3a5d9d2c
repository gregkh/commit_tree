nfsd: check d_can_lookup in fh_verify of directories

Create and other nfsd ops generally assume we can call lookup_one_len on
inodes with S_IFDIR set.  Al says that this assumption isn't true in
general, though it should be for the filesystem objects nfsd sees.

Add a check just to make sure our assumption isn't violated.

Remove a couple checks for i_op->lookup in create code.
