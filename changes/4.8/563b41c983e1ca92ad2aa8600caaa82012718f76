memory: atmel-sdramc: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this option is currently:

config ATMEL_SDRAMC
        bool "Atmel (Multi-port DDR-)SDRAM Controller"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the couple traces of modularity, so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.  An
alternate init level might be worth considering at a later date.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
