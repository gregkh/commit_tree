btrfs: plumb fs_info into btrfs_work

In order to provide an fsid for trace events, we'll need a btrfs_fs_info
pointer.  The most lightweight way to do that for btrfs_work structures
is to associate it with the __btrfs_workqueue structure.  Each queued
btrfs_work structure has a workqueue associated with it, so that's
a natural fit.  It's a privately defined structures, so we add accessors
to retrieve the fs_info pointer.
