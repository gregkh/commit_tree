drm/arc: Remove redundant calls to drm_connector_register_all()

Up to now, the recommendation was for drivers to call drm_dev_register()
followed by drm_connector_register_all(). Now that
drm_connector_register() is safe against multiple invocations, we can
move drm_connector_register_all() to drm_dev_register() and not suffer
from any backwards compatibility issues with drivers not following the
more rigorous init ordering.
