vfs: merge .d_select_inode() into .d_real()

The two methods essentially do the same: find the real dentry/inode
belonging to an overlay dentry.  The difference is in the usage:

vfs_open() uses ->d_select_inode() and expects the function to perform
copy-up if necessary based on the open flags argument.

file_dentry() uses ->d_real() passing in the overlay dentry as well as the
underlying inode.

vfs_rename() uses ->d_select_inode() but passes zero flags.  ->d_real()
with a zero inode would have worked just as well here.

This patch merges the functionality of ->d_select_inode() into ->d_real()
by adding an 'open_flags' argument to the latter.

[Al Viro] Make the signature of d_real() match that of ->d_real() again.
And constify the inode argument, while we are at it.
