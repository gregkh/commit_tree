tcp: return sizeof tcp_dctcp_info in dctcp_get_info()

Make sure that dctcp_get_info() returns only the size of the
info->dctcp struct that it zeroes out and fills in. Previously it had
been returning the size of the enclosing tcp_cc_info union,
sizeof(*info).  There is no problem yet, but that union that may one
day be larger than struct tcp_dctcp_info, in which case the
TCP_CC_INFO code might accidentally copy uninitialized bytes from the
stack.
