drm/bridge: adv7511: Fix mutex deadlock when interrupts are disabled

When the adv7511 i2c client doesn't have an interrupt line, we observe a
deadlock on caused by trying to lock drm device's mode_config.mutex twice
in the same context.

Here is the sequence that causes it:

ioctl DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETCONNECTOR from userspace
  drm_mode_getconnector (acquires mode_config mutex)
    connector->fill_modes()
    drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes
      connector_funcs->get_modes
	adv7511_encoder_get_modes
	  adv7511_get_edid_block
	    adv7511_irq_process
	      drm_helper_hpd_irq_event (acquires mode_config mutex again)

In adv7511_irq_process, don't call drm_helper_hpd_irq_event when not
called from the interrupt handler. It doesn't serve any purpose there
anyway.
