cpufreq: Remove cpufreq_frequency_get_table()

Most of the callers of cpufreq_frequency_get_table() already have the
pointer to a valid 'policy' structure and they don't really need to go
through the per-cpu variable first and then a check to validate the
frequency, in order to find the freq-table for the policy.

Directly use the policy->freq_table field instead for them.

Only one user of that API is left after above changes, cpu_cooling.c and
it accesses the freq_table in a racy way as the policy can get freed in
between.

Fix it by using cpufreq_cpu_get() properly.

Since there are no more users of cpufreq_frequency_get_table() left, get
rid of it.
