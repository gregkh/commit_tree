arm64: Remove stack duplicating code from jprobes

Because the arm64 calling standard allows stacked function arguments to be
anywhere in the stack frame, do not attempt to duplicate the stack frame for
jprobes handler functions.

Documentation changes to describe this issue have been broken out into a
separate patch in order to simultaneously address them in other
architecture(s).
