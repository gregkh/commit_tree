IB/hfi1: Pull FECN/BECN processing to a common place

There were multiple places where FECN/BECN processing was
being done for the different types of QPs. All of that code
was very similar, which meant that it could be pulled into
a single function used by the different QP types.

To retain the performance in the fastpath, the common code
starts with an inline function, which only calls the slow
path if the packet has any of the [FB]ECN bits set.
