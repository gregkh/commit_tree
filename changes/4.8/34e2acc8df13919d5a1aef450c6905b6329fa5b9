[media] tw686x: Add support for DMA scatter-gather mode

Now that the driver has the infrastructure to support more
DMA modes, let's add the DMA scatter-gather mode.

In this mode, the device delivers sequential top-bottom
frames. The scatter-gather logic is based on staging's
tw686x-kh driver (by Krzysztof Ha?asa).
