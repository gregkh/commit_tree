locking/atomic, arch/tile: Fix tilepro build

The tilepro change wasn't ever compiled it seems (the 0day built bot
also doesn't have a toolchain for it).

Make it work.

The thing that makes the patch bigger than desired is namespace
collision with the C11 __atomic builtin functions. So rename the
tilepro functions to __atomic32.
