kconfig.h: use __is_defined() to check if MODULE is defined

The macro MODULE is not a config option, it is a per-file build
option.  So, config_enabled(MODULE) is not sensible.  (There is
another case in include/linux/export.h, where config_enabled() is
used against a non-config option.)

This commit renames some macros in include/linux/kconfig.h for the
use for non-config macros and replaces config_enabled(MODULE) with
__is_defined(MODULE).

I am keeping config_enabled() because it is still referenced from
some places, but I expect it would be deprecated in the future.
