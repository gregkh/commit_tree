mm/hugetlb: fix incorrect hugepages count during mem hotplug

When memory hotplug operates, free hugepages will be freed if the
movable node is offline.  Therefore, /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages will be
incorrect.

Fix it by reducing max_huge_pages when the node is offlined.

n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com said:

: dissolve_free_huge_page intends to break a hugepage into buddy, and the
: destination hugepage is supposed to be allocated from the pool of the
: destination node, so the system-wide pool size is reduced.  So adding
: h->max_huge_pages-- makes sense to me.
