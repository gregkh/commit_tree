clk: imx: correct AV PLL rate formula

The audio/video PLL's rate calculation is as below in RM:

Fref * (DIV_SELECT + NUM / DENOM), in origin clk-pllv3's
code, below code is used:

(parent_rate * div) + ((parent_rate / mfd) * mfn

as it does NOT consider the float data using div, so below
formula should be used as a decent method:

(parent_rate * div) + ((parent_rate * mfn) / mfd)

and we also need to consider parent_rate * mfd may overflow
a 32 bit value, 64 bit value should be used.

After updating this formula, the dram PLL's rate is
1066MHz, which is correct, while the old formula gets
1056MHz.
