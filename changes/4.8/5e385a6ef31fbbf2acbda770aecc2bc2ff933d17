genirq: Add a helper to spread an affinity mask for MSI/MSI-X vectors

This is lifted from the blk-mq code and adopted to use the affinity mask
concept just introduced in the irq handling code.  It tries to keep the
algorithm the same as the one current used by blk-mq, but improvements
like assining vectors on a per-node basis instead of just per sibling
are possible with this simple move and refactoring.
