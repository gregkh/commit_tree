nfsd: remove unnecessary positive-dentry check

vfs_{create,mkdir,mknod} each begin with a call to may_create(), which
returns EEXIST if the object already exists.

This check is therefore unnecessary.

(In the NFSv2 case, nfsd_proc_create also has such a check.  Contrary to
RFC 1094, our code seems to believe that a CREATE of an existing file
should succeed.  I'm leaving that behavior alone.)
