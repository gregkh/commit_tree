rcu: Fix outdated rcu_scheduler_active comment

The comment header for rcu_scheduler_active states that it is used
to optimize synchronize_sched() at early boot.  This is incorrect.
The synchronize_sched() function instead checks the number of online
CPUs.  This commit therefore replaces the comment's synchronize_sched()
with synchronize_rcu(), which really does use rcu_scheduler_active for
this purpose.
