drm/i915/bxt: Adjusting the error in horizontal timings retrieval

In BXT DSI there is no regs programmed with few horizontal timings
in Pixels but txbyteclkhs.. So retrieval process adds some
ROUND_UP ERRORS in the process of PIXELS<==>txbyteclkhs.

Actually here for the given adjusted_mode, we are calculating the
value programmed to the port and then back to the horizontal timing
param in pixels. This is the expected value at the end of get_config,
including roundup errors. And if that is same as retrieved value
from port, then retrieved (HW state) adjusted_mode's horizontal
timings are corrected to match with SW state to nullify the errors.
