clk: tegra: Micro-optimize Tegra210 clock setup

sor_safe being the parent of the dpaux and dpaux1 clocks, it's not only
natural, but also slightly more efficient, to initialize it before its
children. This avoids orphaning the dpaux and dpaux1 clocks only to get
them reparented when the sor_safe clock is registered.
