net/ncsi: NCSI response packet handler

The NCSI response packets are sent to MC (Management Controller)
from the remote end. They are responses of NCSI command packets
for multiple purposes: completion status of NCSI command packets,
return NCSI channel's capability or configuration etc.

This defines struct to represent NCSI response packets and introduces
function ncsi_rcv_rsp() which will be used to receive NCSI response
packets and parse them.
