vmxnet3: fix tx data ring copy for variable size

'Commit 3c8b3efc061a ("vmxnet3: allow variable length transmit data ring
buffer")' changed the size of the buffers in the tx data ring from a
fixed size of 128 bytes to a variable size.

However, while copying data to the data ring, vmxnet3_copy_hdr continues
to carry the old code that assumes fixed buffer size of 128. This patch
fixes it by adding correct offset based on the actual data ring buffer
size.
