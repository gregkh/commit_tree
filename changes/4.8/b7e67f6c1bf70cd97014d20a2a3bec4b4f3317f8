doc-rst: linux_tv: supress lots of warnings

The c language parser checks if there are duplicated object
definitions. That causes lots of warnings like:
	WARNING: duplicate C object description of ioctl

Let's remove those by telling Sphinx that the language for
those objects are c++. The look of the descriptions will
be close, and the warnings will be gone.

Please notice that we had to keep a few of them as C, as
the c++ parser seems to be broken when it finds an enum.

Yet, this reduced from 219 warnings to 143, with is
a good thing.
