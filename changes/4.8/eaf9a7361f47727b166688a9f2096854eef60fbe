dm: set DMF_SUSPENDED* _before_ clearing DMF_NOFLUSH_SUSPENDING

Otherwise, there is potential for both DMF_SUSPENDED* and
DMF_NOFLUSH_SUSPENDING to not be set during dm_suspend() -- which is
definitely _not_ a valid state.

This fix, in conjuction with "dm rq: fix the starting and stopping of
blk-mq queues", addresses the potential for request-based DM multipath's
__multipath_map() to see !dm_noflush_suspending() during suspend.
