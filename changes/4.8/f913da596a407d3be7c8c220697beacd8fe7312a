proc, oom: drop bogus sighand lock

Oleg has pointed out that can simplify both oom_adj_{read,write} and
oom_score_adj_{read,write} even further and drop the sighand lock.  The
main purpose of the lock was to protect p->signal from going away but this
will not happen since ea6d290ca34c ("signals: make task_struct->signal
immutable/refcountable").

The other role of the lock was to synchronize different writers,
especially those with CAP_SYS_RESOURCE.  Introduce a mutex for this
purpose.  Later patches will need this lock anyway.
