parisc: Fix automatic selection of cr16 clocksource

Commit 54b66800907 (parisc: Add native high-resolution sched_clock()
implementation) added support to use the CPU-internal cr16 counters as reliable
clocksource with the help of HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK.

Sadly the commit missed to remove the hack which prevented cr16 to become the
default clocksource even on SMP systems.
