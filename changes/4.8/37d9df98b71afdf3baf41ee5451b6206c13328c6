KVM: s390: backup the currently enabled gmap when scheduled out

Nested virtualization will have to enable own gmaps. Current code
would enable the wrong gmap whenever scheduled out and back in,
therefore resulting in the wrong gmap being enabled.

This patch reenables the last enabled gmap, therefore avoiding having to
touch vcpu->arch.gmap when enabling a different gmap.
