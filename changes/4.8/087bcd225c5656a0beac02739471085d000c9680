crypto: tcrypt - Add speed tests for SHA multibuffer algorithms

The existing test suite to calculate the speed of the SHA algorithms
assumes serial (single buffer)) computation of data. With the SHA
multibuffer algorithms, we work on 8 lanes of data in parallel. Hence,
the need to introduce a new test suite to calculate the speed for these
algorithms.
