ACPI: Execute _PTS before system reboot

The _PTS control method is defined in the section 7.4.1 of acpi 6.0
spec. The _PTS control method is executed by the OS during the sleep
transition process for S1, S2, S3, S4, and for orderly S5 shutdown.

The _PTS control method provides the BIOS a mechanism for performing
some housekeeping, such as writing the sleep type value to the embedded
controller, before entering the system sleeping state. Note that some
Lenovo Server BIOS use this mechanism to detect reboot event and
prompt user by popped dialog box.

According to section 7.5 of acpi 6.0 spec, _PTS should run after _TTS.
Add a _PTS evaulation to the existing _TTS reboot notifier and change
the notifier name to reflect the fact that it's not for _TTS only any
more.
