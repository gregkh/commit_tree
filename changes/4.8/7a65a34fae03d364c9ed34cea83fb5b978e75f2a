sh: make time.c explicitly non-modular

The Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is:

obj-y   := debugtraps.o dma-nommu.o dumpstack.o                 \
[...]
           syscalls_$(BITS).o time.o topology.o traps.o         \
           traps_$(BITS).o unwinder.o

....meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular code, so that when reading
the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.
