KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Introduce new KVM ITS device

Introduce a new KVM device that represents an ARM Interrupt Translation
Service (ITS) controller. Since there can be multiple of this per guest,
we can't piggy back on the existing GICv3 distributor device, but create
a new type of KVM device.
On the KVM_CREATE_DEVICE ioctl we allocate and initialize the ITS data
structure and store the pointer in the kvm_device data.
Upon an explicit init ioctl from userland (after having setup the MMIO
address) we register the handlers with the kvm_io_bus framework.
Any reference to an ITS thus has to go via this interface.
