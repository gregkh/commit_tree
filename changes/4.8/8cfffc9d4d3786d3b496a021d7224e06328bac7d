tpm: Get rid of chip->pdev

This is a hold over from before the struct device conversion.

- All prints should be using &chip->dev, which is the Linux
  standard. This changes prints to use tpm0 as the device name,
  not the PnP/etc ID.
- The few places involving sysfs/modules that really do need the
  parent just use chip->dev.parent instead
- We no longer need to get_device(pdev) in any places since it is no
  longer used by any of the code. The kref on the parent is held
  by the device core during device_add and dropped in device_del
