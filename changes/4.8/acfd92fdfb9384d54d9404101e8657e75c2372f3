pwm: lpc32xx: Set PWM_PIN_LEVEL bit to default value

The PWM_PIN_LEVEL bit is leave unset by the kernel PWM driver.

Prior to commit 08ee77b5a5de27ad63c92262ebcb4efe0da93b58,
the PWM_PIN_LEVEL bit was always clear when the PWM was disable
and a 0 logic level was apply to the output.

According to the LPC32x0 User Manual [1],
the default value for bit 30 (PWM_PIN_LEVEL) is 0.

This change initialize the pin level to 0 (default value) and
update the register value accordingly.
