rxrpc: Kill the client connection bundle concept

Kill off the concept of maintaining a bundle of connections to a particular
target service to increase the number of call slots available for any
beyond four for that service (there are four call slots per connection).

This will make cleaning up the connection handling code easier and
facilitate removal of the rxrpc_transport struct.  Bundling can be
reintroduced later if necessary.
