mm: convert zone_reclaim to node_reclaim

As reclaim is now per-node based, convert zone_reclaim to be
node_reclaim.  It is possible that a node will be reclaimed multiple
times if it has multiple zones but this is unavoidable without caching
all nodes traversed so far.  The documentation and interface to
userspace is the same from a configuration perspective and will will be
similar in behaviour unless the node-local allocation requests were also
limited to lower zones.
