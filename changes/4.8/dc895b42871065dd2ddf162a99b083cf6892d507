staging: comedi: plx9080.h: remove Power-Up Test Suite stuff

The defines related to the Power-Up Test Suite (PUTS) are just cruft that
has nothing to do with the PLX PCI-9080 chip.  They seem to have been
inherited from "drivers/net/plx9060.h" in the kernel 2.2.16 sources for
use by the "wanxl" driver.  Remove them.
