MAINTAINERS: Switch to kernel.org account for Krzysztof Kozlowski

Change my email address to kernel.org account instead of Samsung one.

Add Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz as a co-maintainer of Maxim and Samsung
PMIC drivers.  These are used on many of our boards along with Exynos
SoCs and Samsung R&D Institute Poland can still take care of them.
