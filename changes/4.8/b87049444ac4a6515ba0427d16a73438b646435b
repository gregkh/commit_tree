xfs: introduce rmap btree definitions

Originally-From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Add new per-ag rmap btree definitions to the per-ag structures. The
rmap btree will sit in the empty slots on disk after the free space
btrees, and hence form a part of the array of space management
btrees. This requires the definition of the btree to be contiguous
with the free space btrees.
