pinctrl: mediatek: fix suspend/resume timing issue

An irq which is a wake up source maybe masked unexpectedly if the wake
up source irq was triggered after pinctrl irqchip suspend and before
suspend_device_irqs finished.
Use *_noirq callbacks to guarantee pinctrl irqchip suspend would be
called after suspend_devices_irqs.
