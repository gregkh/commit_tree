staging/lustre/llite: Restore proper opencache operations

Mark dentries that came to us via NFS in a special way so that
we can tell them apart during open and activate open cache
(we really don't want to do open/close RPC for every NFS IO).

This became needed since dentry revlidate no longer reimplements
any RPCs for lookup, and as such if a dentry is valid,
ll_revalidate_dentry returns 1 and ll_lookup_it() is never visited
during opens, we get straght into ll_file_open() without a valid
intent/RPC. This used to be only true for NFS, so opencache was
engaged needlessly, and it carries a cost of it's own if there is
in fact no repetitive file opening-closing going on
