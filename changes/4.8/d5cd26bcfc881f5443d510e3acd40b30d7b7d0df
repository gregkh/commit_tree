MIPS: KVM: Factor writing of translated guest instructions

The code in kvm_mips_dyntrans.c to write a translated guest instruction
to guest memory depending on the segment is duplicated between each of
the functions. Additionally the cache op translation functions assume
the instruction is in the KSEG0/1 segment rather than KSEG2/3, which is
generally true but isn't guaranteed.

Factor that code into a new kvm_mips_trans_replace() which handles both
KSEG0/1 and KSEG2/3.
