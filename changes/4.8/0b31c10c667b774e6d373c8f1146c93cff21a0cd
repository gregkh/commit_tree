cfq-iosched: Charge at least 1 jiffie instead of 1 ns

Commit 9a7f38c42c2b (cfq-iosched: Convert from jiffies to nanoseconds)
could result in charging just 1 ns to a cgroup submitting IO instead of 1
jiffie we always charged before. It is arguable what is the right amount
to change but for now lets retain the old behavior of always charging at
least one jiffie.
