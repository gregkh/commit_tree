net: ethernet: ti: cpdma: fix lockup in cpdma_ctlr_destroy()

Fix deadlock in cpdma_ctlr_destroy() which is triggered now on
cpsw module removal:
 cpsw_remove()
 - cpdma_ctlr_destroy()
   - spin_lock_irqsave(&ctlr->lock, flags)
   - cpdma_ctlr_stop()
     - spin_lock_irqsave(&ctlr->lock, flags);
   - cpdma_chan_destroy()
     - spin_lock_irqsave(&ctlr->lock, flags);

The issue has not been observed before because CPDMA channels have
been destroyed manually by CPSW until commit d941ebe88a41 ("net:
ethernet: ti: cpsw: use destroy ctlr to destroy channels") was merged.
