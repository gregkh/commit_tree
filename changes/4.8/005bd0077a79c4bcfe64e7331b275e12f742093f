perf/x86: Modify error message in virtualized environment

It is known that PMU isn't working in some virtualized environments.

Modify the message issued in that case to mention why hardware PMU
isn't usable instead of reporting it to be broken.

As a side effect this will correct a little bug in the error message:
The error message was meant to be either of level err or info
depending on the environment (native or virtualized). As the level is
taken from the format string and not the printed string, specifying
it via %s and a conditional argument didn't work the way intended.
