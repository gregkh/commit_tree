serial: 8250_mid: fix divide error bug if baud rate is 0

Since the commit c1a67b48f6a5 ("serial: 8250_pci: replace switch-case by
formula for Intel MID"), the 8250 driver crashes in the byt_set_termios()
function with a divide error. This is caused by the fact that a baud rate of 0
(B0) is not handled properly. Fix it by falling back to B9600 in this case.
