[media] vsp1: clarify FCP dependency

The newly added FCP support in the vsp1 driver causes a link error
when CONFIG_RENESAS_FCP=m, since it's not reachable by built-in code:

drivers/media/built-in.o: In function `vsp1_remove':
:(.text+0xdeca0): undefined reference to `rcar_fcp_put'
drivers/media/built-in.o: In function `vsp1_probe':
:(.text+0xdef44): undefined reference to `rcar_fcp_get'

We already have a conditional dependency on FCP that requires
it for ARM64, so for all others we just have to prevent setting
RENESAS_VSP1=y when RENESAS_FCP=m by extending the FCP dependency.

Fixes: 94fcdf829793 ("[media] v4l: vsp1: Add FCP support")
