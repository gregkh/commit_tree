mm: CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE stop depending on CONFIG_EXPERT

When it was first introduced CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE depended on disabling
CONFIG_ZONE_DMA, a configuration choice reserved for "experts".
However, now that the ZONE_DMA conflict has been eliminated it no longer
makes sense to require CONFIG_EXPERT.
