IB/hfi1,IB/qib: Fix qp_stats sleep with rcu read lock held

The qp init function does a kzalloc() while holding the RCU
lock that encounters the following warning with a debug kernel
when a cat of the qp_stats is done:

[  231.723948] rcu_scheduler_active = 1, debug_locks = 0
[  231.731939] 3 locks held by cat/11355:
[  231.736492]  #0:  (debugfs_srcu){......}, at: [<ffffffff813001a5>] debugfs_use_file_start+0x5/0x90
[  231.746955]  #1:  (&p->lock){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff81289a6c>] seq_read+0x4c/0x3c0
[  231.755873]  #2:  (rcu_read_lock){......}, at: [<ffffffffa0a0c535>] _qp_stats_seq_start+0x5/0xd0 [hfi1]
[  231.766862]

The init functions do an implicit next which requires the rcu read lock
before the kzalloc().

Fix for both drivers is to change the scope of the init function to only
do the allocation and the initialization of the just allocated iter.

The implict next is moved back into the respective start functions to fix
the issue.
