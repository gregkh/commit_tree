s390/vmem: introduce and use SEGMENT_KERNEL and REGION3_KERNEL

Instead of open-coded SEGMENT_KERNEL and REGION3_KERNEL assignments use
defines.  Also to make e.g. pmd_wrprotect() work on the kernel mapping
a couple more flags must be set. Therefore add the missing flags also.

In order to make everything symmetrical this patch also adds software
dirty, young, read and write bits for region 3 table entries.
