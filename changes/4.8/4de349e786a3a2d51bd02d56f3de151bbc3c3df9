can: flexcan: fix resume function

On a imx6ul-pico board the following error is seen during system suspend:

dpm_run_callback(): platform_pm_resume+0x0/0x54 returns -110
PM: Device 2090000.flexcan failed to resume: error -110

The reason for this suspend error is because when the CAN interface is not
active the clocks are disabled and then flexcan_chip_enable() will
always fail due to a timeout error.

In order to fix this issue, only call flexcan_chip_enable/disable()
when the CAN interface is active.

Based on a patch from Dong Aisheng in the NXP kernel.
