sh: make board-secureedge5410 explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config SH_SECUREEDGE5410
        bool "SecureEdge5410"

....meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
