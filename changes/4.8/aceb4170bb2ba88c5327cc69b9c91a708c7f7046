nilfs2: do not use yield()

Use cond_resched() instead of yield() in the loop of
nilfs_transaction_lock() since the usage corresponds to the "be nice for
others" case that the comment of yield() says.

This removes the following checkpatch.pl warning:

 "WARNING: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc
  (sched/core.c)"
