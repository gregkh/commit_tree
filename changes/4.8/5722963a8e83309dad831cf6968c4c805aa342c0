qeth: do not turn on SG per default

According to recent performance measurements, turning on net_device
feature NETIF_F_SG only behaves well, but turning on feature
NETIF_F_GSO shows bad results. Since the kernel activates NETIF_F_GSO
automatically as soon as the driver configures feature NETIF_F_SG, qeth
should not activate feature NETIF_F_SG per default, until the qeth
problems with NETIF_F_GSO are solved.
