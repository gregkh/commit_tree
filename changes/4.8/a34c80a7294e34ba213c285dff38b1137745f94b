freezer, oom: check TIF_MEMDIE on the correct task

freezing_slow_path() is checking TIF_MEMDIE to skip OOM killed tasks.
It is, however, checking the flag on the current task rather than the
given one.  This is really confusing because freezing() can be called
also on !current tasks.  It would end up working correctly for its main
purpose because __refrigerator will be always called on the current task
so the oom victim will never get frozen.  But it could lead to
surprising results when a task which is freezing a cgroup got oom killed
because only part of the cgroup would get frozen.  This is highly
unlikely but worth fixing as the resulting code would be more clear
anyway.
