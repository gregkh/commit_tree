drm/doc: Switch to sphinx/rst fixed-width quoting

Just fallout from switching from asciidoc to sphinx/rst.

v2: Found more. Also s/\//#/ in the vgpu ascii-art - sphinx treats
those as comments and switch to variable-width, which wreaks the
layout.

v3: Undo some of the hacks, rebasing onto latest version of Jani's
series fixed it.
