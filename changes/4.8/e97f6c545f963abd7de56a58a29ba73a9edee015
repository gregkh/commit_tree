xfs: fix xfs_error_get_cfg for negative errnos

xfs_error_get_cfg() is called with bp->b_error as an arg, which is
negative, so the switch statement won't ever find any matches.

This results in only the default error handler having any effect, as
EIO/ENOSPC/ENODEV get ignored due to the wrong sign.

It seems simplest to always flip the error sign to positive, so that
we can handle either negative errors in bp->b_error, or possibly a
positive errno via something like xfs_error_get_cfg(EIO) - this
future-proofs the function.
