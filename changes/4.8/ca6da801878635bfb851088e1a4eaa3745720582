rtc: parisc: provide rtc_class_ops directly

The rtc-generic driver provides an architecture specific
wrapper on top of the generic rtc_class_ops abstraction,
and on pa-risc, that is implemented using an open-coded
version of rtc_time_to_tm/rtc_tm_to_time.

This changes the parisc rtc-generic device to provide its
rtc_class_ops directly, using the normal helper functions,
which makes this y2038 safe (on 32-bit) and simplifies
the implementation.
