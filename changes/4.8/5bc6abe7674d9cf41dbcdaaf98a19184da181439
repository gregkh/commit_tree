drm/i915/gen6+: Interpret mailbox error flags

In order to add proper support for the SAGV, we need to be able to know
what the cause of a failure to change the SAGV through the pcode mailbox
was. The reasoning for this is that some very early pre-release Skylake
machines don't actually allow you to control the SAGV on them, and
indicate an invalid mailbox command was sent.

This also might come in handy in the future for debugging.

Changes since v1:
 - Add functions for interpreting gen6 mailbox error codes along with
   gen7+ error codes, and actually interpret those codes properly
 - Renamed patch to reflect new behavior
