regmap: fix deadlock on _regmap_raw_write() error path

Commit 815806e39bf6 ("regmap: drop cache if the bus transfer error")
added a call to regcache_drop_region() to error path in
_regmap_raw_write(). However that path runs with regmap lock taken,
and regcache_drop_region() tries to re-take it, causing a deadlock.
Fix that by calling map->cache_ops->drop() directly.
