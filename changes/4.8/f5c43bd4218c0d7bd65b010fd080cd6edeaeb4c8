MIPS: KVM: Make KVM_GET_REG_LIST dynamic

Make the implementation of KVM_GET_REG_LIST more dynamic so that only
the subset of registers actually available can be exposed to user mode.
This is important for VZ where some of the guest register state may not
be possible to prevent the guest from accessing, therefore the user
process may need to be aware of the state even if it doesn't understand
what the state is for.

This also allows different MIPS KVM implementations to provide different
registers to one another, by way of new num_regs(vcpu) and
copy_reg_indices(vcpu, indices) callback functions, currently just
stubbed for trap & emulate.
