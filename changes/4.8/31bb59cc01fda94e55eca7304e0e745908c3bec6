drm/i915: Move the get/put irq locking into the caller

With only a single callsite for intel_engine_cs->irq_get and ->irq_put,
we can reduce the code size by moving the common preamble into the
caller, and we can also eliminate the reference counting.

For completeness, as we are no longer doing reference counting on irq,
rename the get/put vfunctions to enable/disable respectively and are
able to review the use of posting reads. We only require the
serialisation with hardware when enabling the interrupt (i.e. so we
cannot miss an interrupt by going to sleep before the hardware truly
enables it).
