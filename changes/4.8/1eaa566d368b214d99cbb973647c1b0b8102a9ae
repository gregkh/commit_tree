jbd2: track more dependencies on transaction commit

So far we were tracking only dependency on transaction commit due to
starting a new handle (which may require commit to start a new
transaction). Now add tracking also for other cases where we wait for
transaction commit. This way lockdep can catch deadlocks e. g. because we
call jbd2_journal_stop() for a synchronous handle with some locks held
which rank below transaction start.
