mm/page_isolation: clean up confused code

When there is an isolated_page, post_alloc_hook() is called with page
but __free_pages() is called with isolated_page.  Since they are the
same so no problem but it's very confusing.  To reduce it, this patch
changes isolated_page to boolean type and uses page variable
consistently.
