crypto: ux500 - do not build with -O0

The ARM allmodconfig build currently warngs because of the
ux500 crypto driver not working well with the jump label
implementation that we started using for dynamic debug, which
breaks building with 'gcc -O0':

Turning off compiler optimizations has never really been supported
here, and it's only used when debugging the driver. I have not found
a good reason for doing this here, other than a misguided attempt
to produce more readable assembly output. Also, the driver is only
used in obsolete hardware that almost certainly nobody will spend
time debugging any more.

This just removes the -O0 flag from the compiler options.
