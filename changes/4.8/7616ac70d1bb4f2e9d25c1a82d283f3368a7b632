apparmor: fix SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH_DEFAULT parameter handling

The newly added Kconfig option could never work and just causes a build error
when disabled:

security/apparmor/lsm.c:675:25: error: 'CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH_DEFAULT' undeclared here (not in a function)
 bool aa_g_hash_policy = CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH_DEFAULT;

The problem is that the macro undefined in this case, and we need to use the IS_ENABLED()
helper to turn it into a boolean constant.

Another minor problem with the original patch is that the option is even offered
in sysfs when SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH is not enabled, so this also hides the option
in that case.
