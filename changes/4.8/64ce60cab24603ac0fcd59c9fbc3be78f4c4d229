hpsa: correct skipping masked peripherals

The SA controller spins down RAID drive spares.

A REGNEWD event causes an inquiry to be sent to all physical
drives. This causes the SA controller to spin up the spare.

The controller suspends all I/O to a logical volume until
the spare is spun up. The spin-up can take over 50 seconds.

This can result in one or both of the following:
 - SML sends down aborts and resets to the logical volume
   and can cause the logical volume to be off-lined.
 - a negative impact on the logical volume's I/O performance
   each time a REGNEWD is triggered.
