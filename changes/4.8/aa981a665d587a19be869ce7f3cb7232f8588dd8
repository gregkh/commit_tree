lkdtm: add usercopy tests

This adds test to detect copy_to_user/copy_from_user problems that are
protected by PAX_USERCOPY (and will be protected by HARDENED_USERCOPY).
Explicitly tests both "to" and "from" directions of heap object size
problems, heap object markings and, stack frame misalignment.
