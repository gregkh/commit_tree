ath10k: fix some of the macro definitions of HTT_RX_IND message

Only five bits are defined to pass tid information in HTT_RX_IND
message, so the mask which can be used to extract tid should be 0x1f
instead of the current 0x3f. Also, macros which can be used to extract
flush_valid and release_valid bits have to be left shifted one bit less
because these information follow the tid right after. This patch does
not really fix anything functionally because these macros are not used
currently.
