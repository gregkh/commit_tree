PM / Domains: Remove redundant pm_request_idle() call in genpd

The PM core increases the runtime PM usage count at the system PM prepare
phase. Later when the system resumes, it does a pm_runtime_put() in the
complete phase, which in addition to decrementing the usage count, does
the equivalent of a pm_request_idle().

Therefore the call to pm_request_idle() from within genpd's ->complete()
callback is redundant, so remove it.
