drm/exynos: iommu: move dma_params configuration code to separate functions

Move code for managing DMA max segment size parameter to separate
functions. This patch also replaces devm_kzalloc() with kzalloc() and
adds proper kfree call. devm_kzalloc() cannot be used for dma_params
structure, because it will be freed on driver remove not on device
release. This means in case of Exynos DRM being compiled as module and
loaded 2 times, a user-after-free issue will happen.
