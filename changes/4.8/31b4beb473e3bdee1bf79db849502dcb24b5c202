ipc/shm: fix crash if CONFIG_SHMEM is not set

Commit c01d5b300774 ("shmem: get_unmapped_area align huge page") makes
use of shm_get_unmapped_area() in shm_file_operations() unconditional to
CONFIG_MMU.

As Tony Battersby pointed this can lead NULL-pointer dereference on
machine with CONFIG_MMU=y and CONFIG_SHMEM=n.  In this case ipc/shm is
backed by ramfs which doesn't provide f_op->get_unmapped_area for
configurations with MMU.

The solution is to provide dummy f_op->get_unmapped_area for ramfs when
CONFIG_MMU=y, which just call current->mm->get_unmapped_area().
