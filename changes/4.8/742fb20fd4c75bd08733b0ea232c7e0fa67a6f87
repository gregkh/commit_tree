net: ethernet: ti: cpdma: switch to use genalloc

TI CPDMA currently uses a bitmap for tracking descriptors alloactions
allocations, but The genalloc already handles the same and can be used
as with special memory (SRAM) as with DMA cherent memory chank
(dma_alloc_coherent()). Hence, switch to using genalloc and add
desc_num property for each channel for limitation of max number of
allowed descriptors for each CPDMA channel. This patch do not affect
on net throuput.
