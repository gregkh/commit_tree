ARM: i.MX: system.c: Remove redundant errata 752271 code

Applying a fix for ARM errata 752271 would already be taken care by a
call to a 'fixup' hook as a part of l2x0_of_init() -> __l2c_init() call
chain. Moreso the code in 'fixup' function would do that based on the
PL310's revsion information, whereas removed code does so based on SoC
version which does not work very well on i.MX6Q+ which identifies itself
as i.MX6Q as well but is not affected by 752271.
