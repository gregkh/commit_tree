perf stat: Add computation of TopDown formulas

Implement the TopDown formulas in 'perf stat'. The topdown basic metrics
reported by the kernel are collected, and the formulas are computed and
output as normal metrics.

See the kernel commit exporting the events for details on the used
metrics.

Committer note:

Output example:

  # perf stat --topdown -a usleep 1

   Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

             retiring     bad speculation   frontend bound   backend bound
  S0-C0    2     23.8%       11.6%            28.3%           36.3%
  S0-C1    2     16.2%       15.7%            36.5%           31.6%

v2: Always print all metrics, only use thresholds for coloring.
v3: Mark retiring over threshold green, not red.
v4: Only print one decimal digit
    Fix color printing of one metric
v5: Avoid printing -0.0
v6: Remove extra frontend event lookup
