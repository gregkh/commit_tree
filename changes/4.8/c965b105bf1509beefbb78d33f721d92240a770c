kbuild: abort build on bad stack protector flag

Before, the stack protector flag was sanity checked before .config had
been reprocessed.  This meant the build couldn't be aborted early, and
only a warning could be emitted followed later by the compiler blowing
up with an unknown flag.  This has caused a lot of confusion over time,
so this splits the flag selection from sanity checking and performs the
sanity checking after the make has been restarted from a reprocessed
.config, so builds can be aborted as early as possible now.

Additionally moves the x86-specific sanity check to the same location,
since it suffered from the same warn-then-wait-for-compiler-failure
problem.
