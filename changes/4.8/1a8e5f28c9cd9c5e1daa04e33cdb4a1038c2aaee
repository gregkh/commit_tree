drm/amdgpu: One function call less in amdgpu_cgs_acpi_eval_object() after error detection

The kfree() function was called in one case by the
amdgpu_cgs_acpi_eval_object() function during error handling
even if the passed variable "obj" contained a null pointer.

* Adjust jump targets according to the Linux coding style convention.

* Delete unnecessary initialisations for the variables "obj"
  and "params" then.
