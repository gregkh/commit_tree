drivers/clocksource/pistachio: Fix memory corruption in init

Driver init code incorrectly uses the block base address and as a result
clears clocksource structure's fields instead of the hardware registers.

Commit 09a998201649 ("timekeeping: Lift clocksource cacheline
restriction") has changed the offsets within pistachio_clocksource
structure and what has previously gone unnoticed now leads to a kernel
panic during boot.
