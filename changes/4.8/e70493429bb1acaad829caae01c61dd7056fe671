perf probe: Warn unmatched function filter correctly

Warn unmatched function filter correctly instead of warning
"symbol-loading error", since that can be a filter issue.

From the technical point of view, this adds a filter chech in map__load
and if there is a filter, it returns -2 (filter-out), instead of -1
(error), and perf-probe checks it and change message.

E.g. without this fix:

  # perf probe -F rt_sp*
  no symbols found in [kernel.kallsyms], maybe install a debug package?
  Failed to load symbols in kernel

With this fix:

  # perf probe -F rt_sp*
  no symbols passed the given filter.
  Failed to find symbols matched to "rt_sp*"
    Error: Failed to show functions.
