drm/i915: Use connector_type for printing in intel_connector_info, v2.

Instead of looking at encoder->type, which may be set to UNKNOWN,
use connector->connector_type. Info cannot be printed for MST
connectors which may have a NULL encoder, return early in that case.

Changes since v1:
- Whitelist encoder types for HDMI and LVDS.
- Fix oops on MST.
- Do not list encoder types for eDP/DP, they're always valid.
