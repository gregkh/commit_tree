ipv6: Allow request socks to contain IPv6 options.

If set, these will take precedence over the parent's options during
both sending and child creation.  If they're not set, the parent's
options (if any) will be used.

This is to allow the security_inet_conn_request() hook to modify the
IPv6 options in just the same way that it already may do for IPv4.
