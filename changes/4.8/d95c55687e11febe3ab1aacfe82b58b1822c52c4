kvm: mmu: track read permission explicitly for shadow EPT page tables

To support execute only mappings on behalf of L1 hypervisors,
reuse ACC_USER_MASK to signify if the L1 hypervisor has the R bit
set.

For the nested EPT case, we assumed that the U bit was always set
since there was no equivalent in EPT page tables.  Strictly
speaking, this was not necessary because handle_ept_violation
never set PFERR_USER_MASK in the error code (uf=0 in the
parlance of update_permission_bitmask).  We now have to set
both U and UF correctly, respectively in FNAME(gpte_access)
and in handle_ept_violation.

Also in handle_ept_violation bit 3 of the exit qualification is
not enough to detect a present PTE; all three bits 3-5 have to
be checked.
