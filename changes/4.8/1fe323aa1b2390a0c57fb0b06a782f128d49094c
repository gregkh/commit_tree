sctp: use event->chunk when it's valid

Commit 52253db924d1 ("sctp: also point GSO head_skb to the sk when
it's available") used event->chunk->head_skb to get the head_skb in
sctp_ulpevent_set_owner().

But at that moment, the event->chunk was NULL, as it cloned the skb
in sctp_ulpevent_make_rcvmsg(). Therefore, that patch didn't really
work.

This patch is to move the event->chunk initialization before calling
sctp_ulpevent_receive_data() so that it uses event->chunk when it's
valid.
