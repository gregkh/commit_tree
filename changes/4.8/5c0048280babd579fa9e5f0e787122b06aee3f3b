dquot: For now explicitly don't support filesystems outside of init_user_ns

Mostly supporting filesystems outside of init_user_ns is
s/&init_usre_ns/dquot->dq_sb->s_user_ns/.  An actual need for
supporting quotas on filesystems outside of s_user_ns is quite a ways
away and to be done responsibily needs an audit on what can happen
with hostile quota files.  Until that audit is complete don't attempt
to support quota files on filesystems outside of s_user_ns.
