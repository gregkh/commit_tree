powerpc/eeh: Switch to conventional PCI address output in EEH log

This is a very minor/trivial fix for the output of PCI address on EEH
logs. The PCI address on "OF node" field currently is using ":" as a
separator for the function, but the usual separator is ".". This patch
changes the separator to dot, so the PCI address is printed as usual.
