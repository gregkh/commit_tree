drm: Protect authmagic with master_mutex

Simplifies cleanup, and there's no reason drivers should ever care
about authmagic at all - it's all handled in the core.

And with that, Ladies and Gentlemen, it's time to pop the champagen
and celebrate: dev->struct_mutex is now officially gone from modern
drivers, and if a driver is using gem_free_object_unlocked and doesn't
do anything else silly it's positively impossible to ever touch
dev->struct_mutex at runtime, anywhere.

Well except for the mutex_init on driver load ;-)

v2: Rebased.
