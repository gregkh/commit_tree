perf cpu_map: Add more helpers

In some cases it's necessry to figure out the map-local index of a given
Linux logical CPU ID. Add a new helper, cpu_map__idx, to acquire this.
As the logic is largely the same as the existing cpu_map__has, this is
rewritten in terms of the new helper.

At the same time, add the inverse operation, cpu_map__cpu, which yields
the logical CPU id for a map-local index. While this can be performed
manually, wrapping this in a helper can make code more legible.
