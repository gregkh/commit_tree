bcache: Remove deprecated create_workqueue

alloc_workqueue replaces deprecated create_workqueue().

Dedicated workqueues have been used since bcache_wq and moving_gc_wq
are workqueues for writes and are being used on a memory reclaim path.
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under memory
pressure.
Since there are only a fixed number of work items, explicit concurrency
limit is unnecessary here.
