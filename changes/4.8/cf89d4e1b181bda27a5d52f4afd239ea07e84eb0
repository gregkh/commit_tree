powerpc/ptrace: Enable support for EBB registers

This patch enables support for EBB state registers related
ELF core note NT_PPC_EBB based ptrace requests through
PTRACE_GETREGSET, PTRACE_SETREGSET calls. This is achieved
through adding one new register sets REGSET_EBB in powerpc
corresponding to the ELF core note sections added in this
regard. It also implements the get, set and active functions
for this new register sets added.
