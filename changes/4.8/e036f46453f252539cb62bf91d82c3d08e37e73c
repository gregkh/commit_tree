NFS: pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return() should match the layout sequence id

When determining which layout segments to return, we do want
pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return to check that they match the layout
sequence id. This ensures that we don't waste time if the server
is replaying a layout recall that has already been satisfied.
