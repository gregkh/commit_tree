USB: hub: change the locking in hub_activate

The locking in hub_activate() is not adequate to provide full mutual
exclusion with hub_quiesce().  The subroutine locks the hub's
usb_interface, but the callers of hub_quiesce() (such as
hub_pre_reset() and hub_event()) hold the lock to the hub's
usb_device.

This patch changes hub_activate() to make it acquire the same lock as
those other routines.
