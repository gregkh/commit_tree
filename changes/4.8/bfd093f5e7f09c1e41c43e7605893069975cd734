zsmalloc: use freeobj for index

Zsmalloc stores first free object's <PFN, obj_idx> position into freeobj
in each zspage.  If we change it with index from first_page instead of
position, it makes page migration simple because we don't need to
correct other entries for linked list if a page is migrated out.
