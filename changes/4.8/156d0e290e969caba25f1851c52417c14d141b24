powerpc/ebpf/jit: Implement JIT compiler for extended BPF

PPC64 eBPF JIT compiler.

Enable with:
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable
or
  echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

... to see the generated JIT code. This can further be processed with
tools/net/bpf_jit_disasm.

With CONFIG_TEST_BPF=m and 'modprobe test_bpf':

 test_bpf: Summary: 305 PASSED, 0 FAILED, [297/297 JIT'ed]

... on both ppc64 BE and LE.

The details of the approach are documented through various comments in
the code.
