Documentation/gpu: convert the KMS properties table to CSV

Pandoc really did a bad job of converting the big KMS properties table
to RST. Instead, put the properties into a separate plain text CSV file,
and include it in the RST file. The generated output isn't very pretty,
but at least the information is there, and it's stored in a format
that's easier to process and improve upon at a later time.

The CSV file was generated by copy-pasting the table from the HTML
generated by the DocBook toolchain into LibreOffice Calc, and then saved
as CSV, unmodified.
