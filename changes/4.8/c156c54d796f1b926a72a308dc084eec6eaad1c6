[media] tw686x: audio: Implement non-memcpy capture

Now that we've introduced the dma_mode parameter to pick the
DMA operation, let's use it to also select the audio DMA
operation.

When dma_mode != memcpy, the driver will avoid using memcpy
in the audio capture path, and the DMA hardware operation
will act directly on the ALSA buffers.
