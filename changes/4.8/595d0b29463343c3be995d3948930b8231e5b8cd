udp: avoid csum_partial() for validated skb

In commit e6afc8ace6dd5 ("udp: remove headers from UDP packets before
queueing"), udp_csum_pull_header() helper was added but missed fact
that CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY packets were now converted to CHECKSUM_NONE
and skb->csum_valid was set to 1 for them.

Since csum_partial() is quite expensive, even for 8-byte area, it is
worth adding a test.

We also can use skb->data instead of udp_hdr() as we are pulling
UDP headers, as it is sightly faster.
