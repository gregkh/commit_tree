cgroup: fix idr leak for the first cgroup root

The valid cgroup hierarchy ID range includes 0, so we can't filter for
positive numbers when freeing it, or it'll leak the first ID. No big
deal, just disruptive when reading the code.

The ID is freed during error handling and when the reference count
hits zero, so the double-free test is not necessary; remove it.
