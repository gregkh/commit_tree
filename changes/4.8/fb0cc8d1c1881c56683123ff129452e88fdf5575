scsi_debug: fix sleep in invalid context

In this post: http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg97124.html the
author shows some kernel infrastructure complaining about a sleep in an
invalid context. Remove offending call to vmalloc().  Instead of using
kzalloc() which reviewers didn't like, use a bucket system (64 bytes on
the stack) and potentially multiple calls to sg_pcopy_from_buffer() to
construct the 'data-in' buffer for the SCSI REPORT LUNS command.
