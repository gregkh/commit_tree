rxrpc: Check that the client conns cache is empty before module removal

Check that the client conns cache is empty before module removal and bug if
not, listing any offending connections that are still present.  Unfortunately,
if there are connections still around, then the transport socket is still
unexpectedly open and active, so we can't just unallocate the connections.
