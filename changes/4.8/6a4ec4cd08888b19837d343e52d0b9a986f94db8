memory: add Atmel EBI (External Bus Interface) driver

The EBI (External Bus Interface) is used to access external peripherals
(NOR, SRAM, NAND, and other specific devices like ethernet controllers).
Each device is assigned a CS line and an address range and can have its
own configuration (timings, access mode, bus width, ...).
This driver provides a generic DT binding to configure a device according
to its requirements.
For specific device controllers (like the NAND one) the SMC timings
should be configured by the controller driver through the matrix and
smc syscon regmaps.
