KVM: s390: don't use current->thread.fpu.* when accessing registers

As the meaning of these variables and pointers seems to change more
frequently, let's directly access our save area, instead of going via
current->thread.

Right now, this is broken for set/get_fpu. They simply overwrite the
host registers, as the pointers to the current save area were turned
into the static host save area.
