drm: document drm_auth.c

Also extract drm_auth.h for nicer grouping.

v2: Nuke the other comments since they don't really explain a lot, and
within the drm core we generally only document functions exported to
drivers: The main audience for these docs are driver writers.

v3: Limit the exposure of drm_master internals by only including
drm_auth.h where it is neede (Chris).

v4: Spelling polish (Emil).
