x86/signals: Add missing signal_compat code for x86 features

The 32-bit siginfo is a different binary format than the 64-bit
one.  So, when running 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels, we have
to convert the kernel's 64-bit version to a 32-bit version that
userspace can grok.

We've added a few features to siginfo over the past few years and
neglected to add them to arch/x86/kernel/signal_compat.c:

   1. The si_addr_lsb used in SIGBUS's sent for machine checks
   2. The upper/lower bounds for MPX SIGSEGV faults
   3. The protection key for pkey faults

I caught this with some protection keys unit tests and realized
it affected a few more features.

This was tested only with my protection keys patch that looks
for a proper value in si_pkey.  I didn't actually test the machine
check or MPX code.
