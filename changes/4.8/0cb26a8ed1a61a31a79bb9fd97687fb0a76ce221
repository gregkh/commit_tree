drm/i915: Move legacy kernel context pinning to intel_ringbuffer.c

This is so that we have symmetry with intel_lrc.c and avoid a source of
if (i915.enable_execlists) layering violation within i915_gem_context.c -
that is we move the specific handling of the dev_priv->kernel_context
for legacy submission into the legacy submission code.

This depends upon the init/fini ordering between contexts and engines
already defined by intel_lrc.c, and also exporting the context alignment
required for pinning the legacy context.

v2: Separate out pin/unpin context funcs for greater symmetry with
intel_lrc. One more step towards unifying behaviour between the two
classes of engines and towards fixing another bug in i915_switch_context
vs requests.
