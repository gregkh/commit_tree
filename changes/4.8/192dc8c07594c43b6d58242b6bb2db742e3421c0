dmaengine: at_xdmac: fix un-exported functions

The at_xdmac_init_used_desc() and at_xdmac_prep_dma_memset()
functions are not exported outside the driver, so make them
static to avoid the following warnings:

drivers/dma/at_xdmac.c:459:6: warning: symbol 'at_xdmac_init_used_desc' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/dma/at_xdmac.c:1205:32: warning: symbol 'at_xdmac_prep_dma_memset' was not declared. Should it be static?
