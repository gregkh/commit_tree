staging: ks7010: avoid workqueue races

My Spectec SDW823 card oopsed when it was already inserted during boot.
When debugging this, I noticed that the card init was done in a seperate
workqueue which was only activated once in probe. After removing the
workqueue and calling the card init directly from probe, the OOPS went
away. It turned out this is the same OOPS which happened when removing
the card, so this seems possible now. Note: There is still a
not-understood card-removed event during boot, but at least it doesn't
crash anymore and the card will be re-probed right away.
