staging: fsl-mc: add support for device table matching

Move the definition of fsl_mc_device_id to its proper location in
mod_devicetable.h, and add fsl-mc bus support to devicetable-offsets.c
and file2alias.c to enable device table matching.  With this patch udev
based module loading of fsl-mc drivers is supported.
