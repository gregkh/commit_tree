perf evlist: Drop redundant evsel->overwrite indicator

evsel->overwrite indicator means an event should be put into
overwritable ring buffer. In current implementation, it equals to
evsel->attr.write_backward. To reduce compliexity, remove
evsel->overwrite, use evsel->attr.write_backward instead.

In addition, in __perf_evsel__open(), if kernel doesn't support
write_backward and user explicitly set it in evsel, don't fallback
like other missing feature, since it is meaningless to fall back to
a forward ring buffer in this case: we are unable to stably read
from an forward overwritable ring buffer.
