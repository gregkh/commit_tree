NFSv4: Cap the transport reconnection timer at 1/2 lease period

We don't want to miss a lease period renewal due to the TCP connection
failing to reconnect in a timely fashion. To ensure this doesn't happen,
cap the reconnection timer so that we retry the connection attempt
at least every 1/2 lease period.
