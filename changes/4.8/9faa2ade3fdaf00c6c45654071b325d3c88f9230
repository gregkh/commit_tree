staging/lustre/ptlrpc: missing wakeup for ptlrpc_check_set

This patch changes a few things:

- There is no guarantee that request_out_callback will happen
  before reply_in_callback, if a request got reply and unlinked
  reply buffer before request_out_callback is called, then the
  thread waiting on ptlrpc_request_set will miss wakeup event.

  This may seriously impact performance of some IO workloads or
  result in RPC timeout

- To make code more easier to understand, this patch changes
  action-bits "rq_req_unlink" and "rq_reply_unlink" to
  status-bits "rq_req_unlinked" and "rq_reply_unlinked"
