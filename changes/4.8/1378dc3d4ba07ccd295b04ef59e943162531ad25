arm64: mm: run pgtable_page_ctor() on non-swapper translation table pages

The kernel page table creation routines are accessible to other subsystems
(e.g., EFI) via the create_pgd_mapping() entry point, which allows mappings
to be created that are not covered by init_mm.

Since generic code such as apply_to_page_range() may expect translation
table pages that are not associated with init_mm to be covered by fully
constructed struct pages, add a call to pgtable_page_ctor() in the alloc
function used by create_pgd_mapping. Since it is no longer used by
create_mapping_late(), also update the name of this function to better
reflect its purpose.
