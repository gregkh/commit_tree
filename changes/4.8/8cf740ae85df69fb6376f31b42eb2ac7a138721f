crypto: marvell - Don't copy IV vectors from the _process op for ciphers

The IV output vectors should only be copied from the _complete operation
and not from the _process operation, i.e only from the operation that is
designed to copy the result of the request to the right location. This
copy is already done in the _complete operation, so this commit removes
the duplicated code in the _process op.
