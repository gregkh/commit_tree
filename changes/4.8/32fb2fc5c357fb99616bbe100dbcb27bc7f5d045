vmlinux.lds.h: allow arch specific handling of ro_after_init data section

commit c74ba8b3480d ("arch: Introduce post-init read-only memory")
introduced the __ro_after_init attribute which allows to add variables
to the ro_after_init data section.

This new section was added to rodata, even though it contains writable
data. This in turn causes problems on architectures which mark the
page table entries read-only that point to rodata very early.

This patch allows architectures to implement an own handling of the
.data..ro_after_init section.
Usually that would be:
- mark the rodata section read-only very early
- mark the ro_after_init section read-only within mark_rodata_ro
