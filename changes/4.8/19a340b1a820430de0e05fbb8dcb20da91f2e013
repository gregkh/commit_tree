dmaengine: mv_xor_v2: new driver

The new mv_xor_v2 driver supports the XOR engines found in the 64-bits
ARM from Marvell of the Armada 7K and Armada 8K family. This XOR
engine is a completely new hardware block, entirely different from the
one used on previous Marvell Armada platforms, which use the existing
mv_xor driver.
