cifs: Check for existing directory when opening file with O_CREAT

When opening a file with O_CREAT flag, check to see if the file opened
is an existing directory.

This prevents the directory from being opened which subsequently causes
a crash when the close function for directories cifs_closedir() is called
which frees up the file->private_data memory while the file is still
listed on the open file list for the tcon.
