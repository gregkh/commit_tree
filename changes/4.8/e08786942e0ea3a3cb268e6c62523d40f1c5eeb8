sctp: allow receiving msg when TCP-style sk is in CLOSED state

Commit 141ddefce7c8 ("sctp: change sk state to CLOSED instead of
CLOSING in sctp_sock_migrate") changed sk state to CLOSED if the
assoc is closed when sctp_accept clones a new sk.

If there is still data in sk receive queue, users will not be able
to read it any more, as sctp_recvmsg returns directly if sk state
is CLOSED.

This patch is to add CLOSED state check in sctp_recvmsg to allow
reading data from TCP-style sk with CLOSED state as what TCP does.
