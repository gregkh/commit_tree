i40e: refactor Rx filter handling

Properly track filter adds and deletes so the driver doesn't lose filters
during resets and up/down cycles. Add a tracking mechanism so that the
driver knows when to enter and leave promiscuous mode.

Implement a simple state machine so the driver can track the status of
each filter throughout its lifecycle. Properly manage the overflow promiscuous
state for the each VSI, and provide a way for the driver to detect when to exit
overflow promiscuous mode.

Remove all possible default MAC filters that the firmware may have set up so
that the driver can manage these correctly, particularly when VLANs come into
play. Remove the LAA flag for filters; instead just send whatever we get through
set_mac to the firmware as the LAA for wakeup purposes.

Finally, add the state of each filter to debugfs output so we can see what's
going on inside the driver's pointy little head.
