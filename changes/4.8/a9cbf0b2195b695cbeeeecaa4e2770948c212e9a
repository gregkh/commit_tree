powerpc/powernv : Drop reference added by kset_find_obj()

In a situation, where Linux kernel gets notified about duplicate error log
from OPAL, it is been observed that kernel fails to remove sysfs entries
(/sys/firmware/opal/elog/0xXXXXXXXX) of such error logs. This is because,
we currently search the error log/dump kobject in the kset list via
'kset_find_obj()' routine. Which eventually increment the reference count
by one, once it founds the kobject.

So, unless we decrement the reference count by one after it found the kobject,
we would not be able to release the kobject properly later.

This patch adds the 'kobject_put()' which was missing earlier.
