Revert "printk: create pr_<level> functions"

This reverts commit 874f9c7da9a4acbc1b9e12ca722579fb50e4d142.

Geert Uytterhoeven reports:
 "This change seems to have an (unintendent?) side-effect.

  Before, pr_*() calls without a trailing newline characters would be
  printed with a newline character appended, both on the console and in
  the output of the dmesg command.

  After this commit, no new line character is appended, and the output
  of the next pr_*() call of the same type may be appended, like in:

    - Truncating RAM at 0x0000000040000000-0x00000000c0000000 to -0x0000000070000000
    - Ignoring RAM at 0x0000000200000000-0x0000000240000000 (!CONFIG_HIGHMEM)
    + Truncating RAM at 0x0000000040000000-0x00000000c0000000 to -0x0000000070000000Ignoring RAM at 0x0000000200000000-0x0000000240000000 (!CONFIG_HIGHMEM)"

Joe Perches says:
 "No, that is not intentional.

  The newline handling code inside vprintk_emit is a bit involved and
  for now I suggest a revert until this has all the same behavior as
  earlier"
