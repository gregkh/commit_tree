ext4: Fix WARN_ON_ONCE in ext4_commit_super()

If there are racing calls to ext4_commit_super() it's possible for
another writeback of the superblock to result in the buffer being
marked with an error after we check if the buffer is marked as having
a write error and the buffer up-to-date flag is set again.  If that
happens mark_buffer_dirty() can end up throwing a WARN_ON_ONCE.

Fix this by moving this check to write before we call
write_buffer_dirty(), and keeping the buffer locked during this whole
sequence.
