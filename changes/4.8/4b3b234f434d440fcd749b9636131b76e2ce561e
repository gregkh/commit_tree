x86/cpu: Rename "WESTMERE2" family to "NEHALEM_G"

Len Brown noticed something was amiss in our INTEL_FAM6_*
definitions.  It seems like model 0x1F was a Nehalem part,
marketed as "Intel Core i7 and i5 Processors" (according to the
SDM).  But, although it was a Nehalem 0x1F had some uncore events
which were shared with Westmere.

Len also mentioned he thought it was called "Havendale", which
Wikipedia says was graphics-oriented and canceled:

So either way, it's probably not imporant what we call it, but
call it Nehalem to be accurate, and add a "G" since it seems
graphics-related.  If it were canceled that would be a good reason
why it's so sparsely and inconsistently referred to in the code.
