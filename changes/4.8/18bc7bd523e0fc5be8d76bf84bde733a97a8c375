x86/boot: Synchronize trampoline_cr4_features and mmu_cr4_features directly

The initialization process for trampoline_cr4_features and
mmu_cr4_features was confusing.  The intent is for mmu_cr4_features
and *trampoline_cr4_features to stay in sync, but
trampoline_cr4_features is NULL until setup_real_mode() runs.  The
old code synchronized *trampoline_cr4_features *twice*, once in
setup_real_mode() and once in setup_arch().  It also initialized
mmu_cr4_features in setup_real_mode(), which causes the actual value
of mmu_cr4_features to potentially depend on when setup_real_mode()
is called.

With this patch, mmu_cr4_features is initialized directly in
setup_arch(), and *trampoline_cr4_features is synchronized to
mmu_cr4_features when the trampoline is set up.

After this patch, it should be safe to defer setup_real_mode().
