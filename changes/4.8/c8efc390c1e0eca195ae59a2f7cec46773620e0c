mm, rmap: fix false positive VM_BUG() in page_add_file_rmap()

PageTransCompound() doesn't distinguish THP from from any other type of
compound pages.  This can lead to false-positive VM_BUG_ON() in
page_add_file_rmap() if called on compound page from a driver[1].

I think we can exclude such cases by checking if the page belong to a
mapping.

The VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() is downgraded to VM_WARN_ON_ONCE().  This path
should not cause any harm to non-THP page, but good to know if we step
on anything else.
