powerpc/8xx: Don't use page table for linear memory space

Instead of using the first level page table to define mappings for
the linear memory space, we can use direct mapping from the TLB
handling routines. This has several advantages:
* No need to read the tables at each TLB miss
* No issue in 16k pages mode where the 1st level table maps 64 Mbytes

The size of the available linear space is known at system startup.
In order to avoid data access at each TLB miss to know the memory
size, the TLB routine is patched at startup with the proper size

This patch provides a 10%-15% improvment of TLB miss handling for
kernel addresses
