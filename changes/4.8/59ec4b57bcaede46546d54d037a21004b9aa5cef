ALSA: hda - Fix headset mic detection problem for two dell machines

One of the machines has ALC255 on it, another one has ALC298 on it.

On the machine with the codec ALC298, it also has the speaker volume
problem, so we add the fixup chained to ALC298_FIXUP_SPK_VOLUME rather
than adding a group of pin definition in the pin quirk table, since
the speak volume problem does not happen on other machines yet.
