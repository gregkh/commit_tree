mmc: sdhci: add standard hw auto retuning support

If HW supports SDHCI_TUNING_MODE_3 which is auto retuning, we won't
retune during runtime suspend and resume, instead we use Re-tuning
Request signaled via SDHCI_INT_RETUNE interrupt to do retuning and
hw auto retuning during data transfer to guarantee the signal sample
window correction.

This can avoid a mass of repeatedly retuning during small file system
data access and improve the performance.
