mailbox: mailbox-test: set tdev->signal to NULL after freeing

tdev->signal is not set NULL after it's freed. This will cause random
exceptions when the stale pointer is accessed after tdev->signal is
freed. Also, since tdev->signal allocation is skipped the next time
it's written, this leads to continuous fault finally leading to the
total death of the system.
