IB/uverbs: Add WQ support

User space applications which use RSS functionality need to create
a work queue object (WQ). The lifetime of such an object is:
 * Create a WQ
 * Modify the WQ from reset to init state.
 * Use the WQ (by downstream patches).
 * Destroy the WQ.

These commands are added to the uverbs API.
