perf/x86/intel/bts: Make it an exclusive PMU

Just like intel_pt, intel_bts can only handle one event at a time,
which is the reason we introduced PERF_PMU_CAP_EXCLUSIVE in the first
place. However, at the moment one can have as many intel_bts events
within the same context at the same time as one pleases. Only one of
them, however, will get scheduled and receive the actual trace data.

Fix this by making intel_bts an "exclusive" PMU.
