MIPS: KVM: Move commpage so 0x0 is unmapped

The comm page which is mapped into the guest kernel address space at
0x0 has the unfortunate side effect of allowing guest kernel NULL
pointer dereferences to succeed. The only constraint on this address is
that it must be within 32KiB of 0x0, so that single lw/sw instructions
(which have 16-bit signed offset fields) can be used to access it, using
the zero register as a base.

So lets move the comm page as high as possible within that constraint so
that 0x0 can be left unmapped, at least for page sizes < 32KiB.
