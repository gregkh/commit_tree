drm/i915: pwrite/pread do not require obj->base.filp, just pages

The idea behind relaxing the restriction for pread/pwrite was to handle
!obj->base.flip, i.e. non-shmemfs backed objects, which only requires
that the object provide struct pages.

v2: Remove excess (). Note enough editing after copy'n'paste.
v3: Use new i915_gem_object_has_struct_page()
