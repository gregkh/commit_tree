ACPI/processor: Avoid STARTING/DYING actions in a more logical way

As part of the hotplug cleanup, the CPU_STARTING/DYING actions are going
away soon.  This driver needlessly uses those two macro, and so this patch
replaces that code with something more sensible.

Commit:

  8da8373447d6a57a5a9f55233d35beb15d92d0d2 ("ACPI / processor: Fix STARTING/DYING action in acpi_cpu_soft_notify()")

added checks for those two actions, because the notification callback can
sleep, causing a hung CPU. This patch instead checks for the ONLINE/DEAD
actions, which are the ones that are handled by the driver in the first
place.
