tools lib bpf: Use IS_ERR() reporting macros with bpf_map__get_private()

To try to, over time, consistently use the IS_ERR() interface instead of
using two return values, i.e. the integer return value for an error and
the pointer address to return the bpf_map->priv pointer.

Also rename it to bpf__priv(), to leave the "get" term for reference
counting.

Noticed while working on using BPF for collecting non-integer syscall
argument payloads (struct sockaddr in calls such as connect(), for
instance), where we need to use BPF maps and thus generalise
bpf__setup_stdout() to connect bpf_output events with maps in a bpf
proggie.
