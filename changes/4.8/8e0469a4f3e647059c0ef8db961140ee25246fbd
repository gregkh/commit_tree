stm class: Add runtime power management handling

Currently, there's no runtime pm in stm class devices, which makes it
harder for the underlying hardware drivers to handle their power
management.

This patch applies the following runtime pm policy to stm class devices,
which their parents can rely on for their power management tracking:

  * device is in use during character device writes,
  * delayed autosuspend is used to keep it active between adjacent
  writes,
  * device is in use while mmio regions are mapped,
  * device is is use while any stm_source devices are linked to it.
