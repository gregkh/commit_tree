net: ipv6: Fix ping to link-local addresses.

ping_v6_sendmsg does not set flowi6_oif in response to
sin6_scope_id or sk_bound_dev_if, so it is not possible to use
these APIs to ping an IPv6 address on a different interface.
Instead, it sets flowi6_iif, which is incorrect but harmless.

Stop setting flowi6_iif, and support various ways of setting oif
in the same priority order used by udpv6_sendmsg.
