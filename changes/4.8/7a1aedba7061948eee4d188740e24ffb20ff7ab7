asm-generic/io.h: allow barriers in io{read,write}{16,32}be

While reviewing the addition of io{read,write}64be accessors, Arnd

-finds a potential problem:
"If an architecture overrides readq/writeq to have barriers but does
not override ioread64be/iowrite64be, this will lack the barriers and
behave differently from the little-endian version. I think the only
affected architecture is ARC, since ARM and ARM64 both override the
big-endian accessors to have the correct barriers, and all others
don't use barriers at all."

-suggests a fix for the same problem in existing code (16/32-bit
accessors); the fix leads "to a double-swap on architectures that
don't override the io{read,write}{16,32}be accessors, but it will
work correctly on all architectures without them having to override
these accessors."
