ovl: share inode for hard link

Inode attributes are copied up to overlay inode (uid, gid, mode, atime,
mtime, ctime) so generic code using these fields works correcty.  If a hard
link is created in overlayfs separate inodes are allocated for each link.
If chmod/chown/etc. is performed on one of the links then the inode
belonging to the other ones won't be updated.

This patch attempts to fix this by sharing inodes for hard links.

Use inode hash (with real inode pointer as a key) to make sure overlay
inodes are shared for hard links on upper.  Hard links on lower are still
split (which is not user observable until the copy-up happens, see
Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt under "Non-standard behavior").

The inode is only inserted in the hash if it is non-directoy and upper.
