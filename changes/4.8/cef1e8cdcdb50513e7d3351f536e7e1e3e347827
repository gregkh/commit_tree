powerpc/bpf/jit: A few cleanups

1. Per the ISA, ADDIS actually uses RT, rather than RS. Though
   the result is the same, make the usage clear.
2. The multiply instruction used is a 32-bit multiply. Rename PPC_MUL()
   to PPC_MULW() to make the same clear.
3. PPC_STW[U] take the entire 16-bit immediate value and do not require
   word-alignment, per the ISA. Change the macros to use IMM_L().
4. A few white-space cleanups to satisfy checkpatch.pl.
