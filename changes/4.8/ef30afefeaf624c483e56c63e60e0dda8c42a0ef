staging/android: remove struct sync_timeline_ops

Move drv_name, the last field of sync_timeline_ops, to sync_timeline
and remove sync_timeline_ops.

struct sync_timeline_ops was just an extra abstraction on top of
fence_ops, and in the last few commits we removed all it ops in favor
of cleaner fence_ops.
