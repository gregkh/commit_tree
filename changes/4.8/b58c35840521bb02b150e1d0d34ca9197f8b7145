sched/cputime: Replace VTIME_GEN irq time code with IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING code

The CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN irq time tracking code does not
appear to currently work right.

On CPUs without nohz_full=, only tick based irq time sampling is
done, which breaks down when dealing with a nohz_idle CPU.

On firewalls and similar systems, no ticks may happen on a CPU for a
while, and the irq time spent may never get accounted properly. This
can cause issues with capacity planning and power saving, which use
the CPU statistics as inputs in decision making.

Remove the VTIME_GEN vtime irq time code, and replace it with the
IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING code, when selected as a config option by the user.
