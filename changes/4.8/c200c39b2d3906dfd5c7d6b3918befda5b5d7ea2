clk: clk-conf: Fix error message when clock isn't found

When failing to lookup the assigned clock for setting its parents, we
were previously printing a misleading error message that lead to think
that it was the parent clock what couldn't be found.

Change error message to make clear that it's the assigned clock what
couldn't be found in this case.
