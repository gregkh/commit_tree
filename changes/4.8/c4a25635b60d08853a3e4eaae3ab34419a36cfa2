mm: move vmscan writes and file write accounting to the node

As reclaim is now node-based, it follows that page write activity due to
page reclaim should also be accounted for on the node.  For consistency,
also account page writes and page dirtying on a per-node basis.

After this patch, there are a few remaining zone counters that may appear
strange but are fine.  NUMA stats are still per-zone as this is a
user-space interface that tools consume.  NR_MLOCK, NR_SLAB_*,
NR_PAGETABLE, NR_KERNEL_STACK and NR_BOUNCE are all allocations that
potentially pin low memory and cannot trivially be reclaimed on demand.
This information is still useful for debugging a page allocation failure
warning.
