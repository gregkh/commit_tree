arm/arm64: KVM: Enforce HYP read-only mapping of the kernel's rodata section

In order to be able to use C code in HYP, we're now mapping the kernel's
rodata in HYP. It works absolutely fine, except that we're mapping it RWX,
which is not what it should be.

Add a new HYP_PAGE_RO protection, and pass it as the protection flags
when mapping the rodata section.
