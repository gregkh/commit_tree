s390/chsc: sanitize fmt check for chp_desc determination

When fetching channel path descriptors we've only evaluated the rfmt
parameter which could lead us to trigger the chsc even though the
machine doesn't support the specific format or to not trigger the
chsc and report a failure to userspace even though the machine would've
supported it.

Improve these checks and change the parameters of the in-kernel
user to be less confusing.
