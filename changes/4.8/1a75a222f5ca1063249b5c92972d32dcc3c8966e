drm: Hide hw.lock cleanup in filp->release better

A few things:
- Rename the cleanup function from drm_master_release to
  drm_legacy_lock_release. It doesn't relase any master stuff, but
  just the legacy hw lock.
- Hide it in drm_lock.c, which allows us to make a few more functions
  static in there. To avoid forward decl we need to shuffle the code a
  bit though.
- Push the check for ->master into the function itself.
- Only call this for !DRIVER_MODESET.

End result: Another place that takes struct_mutex gone for good for
modern drivers.

v2: Remove leftover comment.
