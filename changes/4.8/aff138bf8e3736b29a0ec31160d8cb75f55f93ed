ARM: dts: exynos: Add TMU nodes regulator supply for Peach boards

The Exynos5800 Peach Pi and Exynos5420 Peach Pit Chromebooks have the
LDO10 1.8V output connected to the VDD18_TS{01,23,4} Exynos SoC pins.

Add this regulator as the input supply of the Thermal Management Unit
channels and also remove the always-on property since all the devices
using LDO10 as input supply are now defined.
