phy: rockchip-emmc: Increase lock time allowance

Previous PHY code waited a fixed amount of time for the DLL to lock at
power on time.  Unfortunately, the time for the DLL to lock is actually
a bit more dynamic and can be longer if the card clock is slower.

Instead of waiting a fixed 30 us, let's now dynamically wait until the
lock bit gets set.  We'll wait up to 10 ms which should be OK even if
the card clock is at the super slow 100 kHz.

On its own, this change makes the PHY power on code a little more
robust.  Before this change the PHY was relying on the eMMC code to make
sure the PHY was only powered on when the card clock was set to at least
50 MHz before, though this reliance wasn't documented anywhere.

This change will be even more useful in future changes where we actually
need to be able to wait for a DLL lock at slower clock speeds.
