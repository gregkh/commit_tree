perf evlist: Update mmap related APIs and helpers

Currently, the evlist mmap related helpers and APIs accept evlist and
idx, and dereference 'struct perf_mmap' by evlist->mmap[idx]. This is
unnecessary, and force each evlist contains only one mmap array.

Following commits are going to introduce multiple mmap arrays to a
evlist.  This patch refators these APIs and helpers, introduces
functions accept perf_mmap pointer directly. New helpers and APIs are
decoupled with perf_evlist, and become perf_mmap functions (so they have
perf_mmap prefix).

Old functions are reimplemented with new functions. Some of them will be
removed in following commits.
