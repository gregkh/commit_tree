KVM: s390: pfmf: fix end address calculation

The current calculation is wrong if absolute != real address. Let's just
calculate the start address for 4k frames upfront. Otherwise, the
calculated end address will be wrong, resulting in wrong memory
location/storage keys getting touched.

To keep low-address protection working (using the effective address),
we have to move the check.
