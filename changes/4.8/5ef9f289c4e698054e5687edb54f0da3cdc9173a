OVS: Ignore negative headroom value

net_device->ndo_set_rx_headroom (introduced in
871b642adebe300be2e50aa5f65a418510f636ec) says

  "Setting a negtaive value reset the rx headroom
   to the default value".

It seems that the OVS implementation in
3a927bc7cf9d0fbe8f4a8189dd5f8440228f64e7 overlooked this and sets
dev->needed_headroom unconditionally.

This doesn't have an immediate effect, but can mess up later
LL_RESERVED_SPACE calculations, such as done in
net/ipv6/mcast.c:mld_newpack.  For reference, this issue was found
from a skb_panic raised there after the length calculations had given
the wrong result.

Note the other current users of this interface
(drivers/net/tun.c:tun_set_headroom and
drivers/net/veth.c:veth_set_rx_headroom) are both checking this
correctly thus need no modification.

Thanks to Ben for some pointers from the crash dumps!
