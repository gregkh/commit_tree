regulator: qcom_smd: Fix voltage ranges for pma8084 ftsmps and pldo

The voltage ranges listed here are wrong. The pma8084 pldo
supports three different overlapping voltage ranges with
differing step sizes and the pma8084 ftsmps supports two. These
ranges can be seen in the "native" spmi regulator driver
(qcom_spmi-regulator.c) at pldo_ranges[] and ftsmps_ranges[]
respectively. Port these ranges over to the RPM SMD regulator
driver so that we list the appropriate set of supported voltages
on these types of regulators.
