drm/i915: Extract checking for backing struct pages to a helper

Currently to see if an object is backed by struct pages (as opposed to
being a simple pointer to stolen memory, for example) we do a manual
check on the obj->ops->flags. This is quite shouty and before adding
more checks in future, we should make it a bit calmer.
