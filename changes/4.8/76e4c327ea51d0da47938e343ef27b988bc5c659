GPU-DRM-OMAP: Delete unnecessary checks before two function calls

The following functions test whether their argument is NULL and then
return immediately.
* backlight_device_unregister
* drm_gem_object_unreference_unlocked

Thus the test around the calls is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
