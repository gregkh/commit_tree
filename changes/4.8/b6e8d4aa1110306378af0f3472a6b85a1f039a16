rapidio: add RapidIO channelized messaging driver

Add channelized messaging driver to support native RapidIO messaging
exchange between multiple senders/recipients on devices that use kernel
RapidIO subsystem services.

This device driver is the result of collaboration within the RapidIO.org
Software Task Group (STG) between Texas Instruments, Prodrive
Technologies, Nokia Networks, BAE and IDT.  Additional input was
received from other members of RapidIO.org.

The objective was to create a character mode driver interface which
exposes messaging capabilities of RapidIO endpoint devices (mports)
directly to applications, in a manner that allows the numerous and
varied RapidIO implementations to interoperate.

This char mode device driver allows user-space applications to setup
messaging communication channels using single shared RapidIO messaging
mailbox.

By default this driver uses RapidIO MBOX_1 (MBOX_0 is reserved for use by
RIONET Ethernet emulation driver).
