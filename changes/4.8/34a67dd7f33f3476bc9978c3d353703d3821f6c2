drm: Extract&Document drm_irq.h

The drm_irq docs want one function from drmP.h, but that one is a
serious mess. Extract it, and while at it improve the docs a bit.
There's a bit a header loop issue since core data structures like
drm_device and drm_driver aren't in their own headers yet, which means
the drm_irq.h include in drmP.h needs to be in just the right spot :(

Also noticed that drm_vblank_crtc->last_wait is entirely unused,
remove it.

v2: git add drm_irq.h ...
