MIPS: KVM: Report more accurate CP0_Config fields to guest

Initialise the guest's CP0_Config register with a few more bits of
information from the host. The BE bit should be set on big endian
machines, the VI bit should be set on machines with a virtually tagged
instruction cache, and the reported architecture revision should match
that of the host (since we won't support emulating pre-r6 instruction
encodings on r6 or vice versa).
