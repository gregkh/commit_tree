nvme/quirk: Add a delay before checking for adapter readiness

When disabling the controller, the specification says the register
NVME_REG_CC should be written and then driver needs to wait the
adapter to be ready, which is checked by reading another register
bit (NVME_CSTS_RDY). There's a timeout validation in this checking,
so in case this timeout is reached the driver gives up and removes
the adapter from the system.

After a firmware activation procedure, the PCI_DEVICE(0x1c58, 0x0003)
(HGST adapter) end up being removed if we issue a reset_controller,
because driver keeps verifying the NVME_REG_CSTS until the timeout is
reached. This patch adds a necessary quirk for this adapter, by
introducing a delay before nvme_wait_ready(), so the reset procedure
is able to be completed. This quirk is needed because just increasing
the timeout is not enough in case of this adapter - the driver must
wait before start reading NVME_REG_CSTS register on this specific
device.
