perf bpf: Rename bpf__foreach_tev() to bpf__foreach_event()

Following commit will allow BPF script attach to tracepoints.
bpf__foreach_tev() will iterate over all events, not only kprobes.
Rename it to bpf__foreach_event().

Since only group and event are used by caller, there's no need to pass
full 'struct probe_trace_event' to bpf_prog_iter_callback_t. Pass only
these two strings. After this patch bpf_prog_iter_callback_t natually
support tracepoints.
