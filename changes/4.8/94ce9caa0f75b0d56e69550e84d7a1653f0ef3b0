bnxt_en: Workaround Nitro A0 hardware RX bug (part 1).

Nitro A0 has a hardware bug in the rx path.  The workaround is to create
a special COS context as a path for non-RSS (non-IP) packets.  Without this
workaround, the chip may stall when receiving RSS and non-RSS packets.

Add infrastructure to allow 2 contexts (RSS and CoS) per VNIC.  Allocate
and configure the CoS context for Nitro A0.
