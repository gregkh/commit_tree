xfrm: Fix memory leak of aead algorithm name

commit 1a6509d99122 ("[IPSEC]: Add support for combined mode algorithms")
introduced aead. The function attach_aead kmemdup()s the algorithm
name during xfrm_state_construct().
However this memory is never freed.
Implementation has since been slightly modified in
commit ee5c23176fcc ("xfrm: Clone states properly on migration")
without resolving this leak.
This patch adds a kfree() call for the aead algorithm name.
