builddeb: really include objtool binary in headers package

On May 4th, Bj√∏rn Mork provided patch 697bbc7b8320 ("builddeb: include
objtool binary in headers package"). However, that one only works if
$srctree=$objtree, because the objtool binaries are not written to the
srctree, but to the objtree.
