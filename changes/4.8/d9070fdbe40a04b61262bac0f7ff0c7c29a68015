regulator: pwm: Retrieve correct voltage

The continuous PWM voltage regulator is caching the voltage value in
the ->volt_uV field. While most of the time this value should reflect the
real voltage, sometime it can be sightly different if the PWM device
rounded the set_duty_cycle request.
Moreover, this value is not valid until someone has modified the regulator
output.

Remove the ->volt_uV field and always rely on the PWM state to calculate
the regulator output.
