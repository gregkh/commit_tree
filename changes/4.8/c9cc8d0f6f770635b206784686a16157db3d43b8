staging/lustre/llite: lock i_lock before __d_drop()

There has been several Lustre Client crashes reported by sites
running with Lustre versions 2.1/2.5, all showing the same
dentry->d_hash->next corrupted pointer cause.

This patch fixes a regression that has been introduced since a
long time by commit :
(LU-506 kernel: FC15 - support dcache scalability changes.)

where i_lock protection usage has been removed and
that is likely to cause racy condition during dentry [un]hashing
and to be the root cause of these crashes.
