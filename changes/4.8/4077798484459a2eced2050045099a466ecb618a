drm/vgem: Attach sw fences to exported vGEM dma-buf (ioctl)

vGEM buffers are useful for passing data between software clients and
hardware renders. By allowing the user to create and attach fences to
the exported vGEM buffers (on the dma-buf), the user can implement a
deferred renderer and queue hardware operations like flipping and then
signal the buffer readiness (i.e. this allows the user to schedule
operations out-of-order, but have them complete in-order).

This also makes it much easier to write tightly controlled testcases for
dma-buf fencing and signaling between hardware drivers.

v2: Don't pretend the fences exist in an ordered timeline, but allocate
a separate fence-context for each fence so that the fences are
unordered.
v3: Make the debug output more interesting, and show the signaled status.
v4: Automatically signal the fence to prevent userspace from
indefinitely hanging drivers.
