KVM: s390: inject PER i-fetch events on applicable icpts

In case we have to emuluate an instruction or part of it (instruction,
partial instruction, operation exception), we have to inject a PER
instruction-fetching event for that instruction, if hardware told us to do
so.

In case we retry an instruction, we must not inject the PER event.

Please note that we don't filter the events properly yet, so guest
debugging will be visible for the guest.
