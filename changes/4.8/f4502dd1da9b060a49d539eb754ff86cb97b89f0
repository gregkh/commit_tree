spi: Add DMA support for spi_flash_read()

Few SPI devices provide accelerated read interfaces to read from
SPI-NOR flash devices. These hardwares also support DMA to transfer data
from flash to memory either via mem-to-mem DMA or dedicated slave DMA
channels. Hence, add support for DMA in order to improve throughput and
reduce CPU load.
Use spi_map_buf() to get sg table for the buffer and pass it to SPI
driver.
