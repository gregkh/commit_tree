fs/fs-writeback.c: inode writeback list tracking tracepoints

The per-sb inode writeback list tracks inodes currently under writeback
to facilitate efficient sync processing.  In particular, it ensures that
sync only needs to walk through a list of inodes that were cleaned by
the sync.

Add a couple tracepoints to help identify when inodes are added/removed
to and from the writeback lists.  Piggyback off of the writeback
lazytime tracepoint template as it already tracks the relevant inode
information.
