iio: pressure: bmp280: add power management

The PM280 has an internal standby-mode, but to really save power
we should shut the sensor down and disconnect the power. With
the proper .pm hooks we can enable both runtime and system power
management of the sensor. We use the *force callbacks from the
system PM hooks. When the sensor comes back we always reconfigure
it to make sure it is ready to roll as expected.
