usb: dwc3: implement runtime PM

this patch implements the most basic pm_runtime
support for dwc3. Whenever USB cable is dettached,
then we will allow core to runtime_suspend.

Runtime suspending will involve completely tearing
down event buffers and require a full soft-reset of
the IP.

Note that a further optimization could be
implemented once we decide to support hibernation,
which is to allow runtime_suspend with cable
connected when bus is in U3. That's subject to a
separate patch, however.
