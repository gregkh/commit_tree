ceph: unify cap flush and snapcap flush

This patch includes following changes
- Assign flush tid to snapcap flush
- Remove session's s_cap_snaps_flushing list. Add inode to session's
  s_cap_flushing list instead. Inode is removed from the list when
  there is no pending snapcap flush or cap flush.
- make __kick_flushing_caps() re-send both snapcap flushes and cap
  flushes.
