x86/acpi: store ACPI ids from MADT for future usage

Currently we don't save ACPI ids (unlike LAPIC ids which go to
x86_cpu_to_apicid) from MADT and we may need this information later.
Particularly, ACPI ids is the only existent way for a PVHVM Xen guest
to figure out Xen's idea of its vCPUs ids before these CPUs boot and
in some cases these ids diverge from Linux's cpu ids.
