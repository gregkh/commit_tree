ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add DSP muti-core infrastructure

The DSP can have more than one cores. In that case the secondary
core has to be managed by the driver. This patch adds the changes
to driver infrastructure to support multiple core.

A new object skl_dsp_cores is introduced to support multiple
core. Helpers skl_dsp_get_core() skl_dsp_put_core() help to
managed the cores.

Many of the power_up/down and DSP APIs take additional argument
of core_id. The primary core, 0 is always powered up first and
then on demand second core.
