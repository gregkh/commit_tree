drm/i915: Do not keep postponing the idle-work

Rather than persistently postponing the idle-work everytime somebody
calls i915_gem_retire_requests() (potentially ensuring that we never
reach the idle state), queue the work the first time we detect all
requests are complete. Then if in 100ms, more requests have been queued,
we will abort the idle-worker and wait again until all the new requests
have been completed.

Of course, this does depend upon the idle worker cancelling itself
gracefully from the previous patch.
