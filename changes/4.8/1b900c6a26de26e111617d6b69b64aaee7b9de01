rcutorture: Use vmlinux as the fallback kernel image

The vmlinux image is available for all the architectures, and suitable
for running a KVM guest by QEMU, besides, we used to copy the vmlinux
to $resdir anyway. Therefore it makes sense to use it as the fallback
kernel image for rcutorture KVM tests.

This patch makes identify_boot_image() return vmlinux if
${TORTURE_BOOT_IMAGE} is not set on non-x86 architectures, also fixes
several places that hard-code "bzImage" as $KERNEL.

This also fixes a problem that PPC doesn't have a bzImage file as build
results.
