mm/memcontrol.c: remove the useless parameter for mc_handle_swap_pte

It seems like this parameter has never been used since being introduced
by 90254a65833b ("memcg: clean up move charge").  Not a big deal because
I assume the function would get inlined into the caller anyway but why
not get rid of it.
