Revert "KVM: SVM: fix trashing of MSR_TSC_AUX"

This reverts commit 9770404a0061ec46dec6e15c4b07731ce2e2d7bb.

The reverted patch is not needed as only userspace uses RDTSCP and
MSR_TSC_AUX is in host_save_user_msrs[] and therefore properly saved in
svm_vcpu_load() and restored in svm_vcpu_put() before every switch to
userspace.

The reverted patch did not allow the kernel to use RDTSCP in the future,
because of missed trashing in svm_set_msr() and 64-bit ifdef.

This reverts commit 2b23c3a6e3eb2fba77eb35fdfa3d71a9aa3f33b7.

2b23c3a6e3eb ("KVM: SVM: do not set MSR_TSC_AUX on 32-bit builds") is a
build fix for 9770404a0061 and reverting them separately would only
break more bisections.
