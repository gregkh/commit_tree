iommu/arm-smmu: Disable stalling faults for all endpoints

Enabling stalling faults can result in hardware deadlock on poorly
designed systems, particularly those with a PCI root complex upstream of
the SMMU.

Although it's not really Linux's job to save hardware integrators from
their own misfortune, it *is* our job to stop userspace (e.g. VFIO
clients) from hosing the system for everybody else, even if they might
already be required to have elevated privileges.

Given that the fault handling code currently executes entirely in IRQ
context, there is nothing that can sensibly be done to recover from
things like page faults anyway, so let's rip this code out for now and
avoid the potential for deadlock.
