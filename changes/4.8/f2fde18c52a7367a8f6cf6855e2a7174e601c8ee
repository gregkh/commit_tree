net/mlx5e: Don't wait for RQ completions on close

This will significantly reduce receive queue flush time on interface
down.

Instead of asking the firmware to flush the RQ (Receive Queue) via
asynchronous completions when moved to error, we handle RQ flush
manually (mlx5e_free_rx_descs) same as we did when RQ flush got timed
out.

This will reduce RQs flush time and speedup interface down procedure
(ifconfig down) from 6 sec to 0.3 sec on a 48 cores system.

Moved mlx5e_free_rx_descs en_main.c where it is needed, to keep en_rx.c
free form non critical data path code for better code locality.
