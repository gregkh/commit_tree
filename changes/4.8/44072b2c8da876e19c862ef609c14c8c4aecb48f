iio: adc: nau7802: Expose possible gains in sysfs

The Nuvoton NAU7802 ADC is able to adjust its gain but prior knowledge of
its possible values was required to adjust it. Users had to guess the
possible gain values based on the ADC datasheet or on this driver's code.

This exposes the possible values in the in_voltage_scale_available file of
each nau7802 ADC device. The gain is set for the whole ADC and is therefore
not configurable by channel. Thus, there exists only one
in_voltage_scale_available file for each nau7802 ADC device even if it has
two separate channels.
