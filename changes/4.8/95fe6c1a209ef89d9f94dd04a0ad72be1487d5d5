block, fs, mm, drivers: use bio set/get op accessors

This patch converts the simple bi_rw use cases in the block,
drivers, mm and fs code to set/get the bio operation using
bio_set_op_attrs/bio_op

These should be simple one or two liner cases, so I just did them
in one patch. The next patches handle the more complicated
cases in a module per patch.
