libnvdimm: allow legacy (e820) pmem region to clear bad blocks

Bad blocks can be injected via /sys/block/pmemN/badblocks. In a situation
where legacy pmem is being used or a pmem region created by using memmap
kernel parameter, the injected bad blocks are not cleared due to
nvdimm_clear_poison() failing from lack of ndctl function pointer. In
this case we need to just return as handled and allow the bad blocks to
be cleared rather than fail.
