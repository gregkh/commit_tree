mm/kasan: get rid of ->alloc_size in struct kasan_alloc_meta

Size of slab object already stored in cache->object_size.

Note, that kmalloc() internally rounds up size of allocation, so
object_size may be not equal to alloc_size, but, usually we don't need
to know the exact size of allocated object.  In case if we need that
information, we still can figure it out from the report.  The dump of
shadow memory allows to identify the end of allocated memory, and
thereby the exact allocation size.
