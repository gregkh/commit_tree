efi: Reorganize the GUID table to make it easier to read

Re-organize the GUID table so that every GUID takes a single line.

This makes each line super long, but if you have a large enough terminal
(or zoom out of a small terminal) then you can see the structure at
a glance - which is more readable than it was the case with the
multi-line layout.
