KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Fix misleading nr_entries in vgic_its_check_device_id

The nr_entries variable in vgic_its_check_device_id actually
describe the size of the L1 table, and not the number of
entries in this table.

Rename it to l1_tbl_size, so that we can now change the code
with a better understanding of what is what.
