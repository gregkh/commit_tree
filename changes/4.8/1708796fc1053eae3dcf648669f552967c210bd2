ASoC: cs53l30: Fix bit shift issue of TDM mode

The TDM mode using PCM format now has two-bit right shift due to the
format configuration in the driver. According to Figure 4-13 in the
CS53L30 datasheet, using ASP_SCLK_INV = 0 and SHIFT_LEFT = 1 should
be the correct combination to create one-bit right shift for the DSP
type A format.
