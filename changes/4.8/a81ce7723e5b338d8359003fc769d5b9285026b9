mmc: sdhci-pxav3: Remove non needed #ifdef CONFIG_PM for dev_pm_ops

As the SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS and the SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS macro deals with
the CONFIG_PM options when assigning the callbacks, it becomes redundant
to control this when declaring the struct dev_pm_ops. Instead let's always
declare it as it simplifies the code.
