powerpc32: provide VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING

This patch provides VIRT_CPU_ACCOUTING to PPC32 architecture.
PPC32 doesn't have the PACA structure, so we use the task_info
structure to store the accounting data.

In order to reuse on PPC32 the PPC64 functions, all u64 data has
been replaced by 'unsigned long' so that it is u32 on PPC32 and
u64 on PPC64
