drm/i915: Merge legacy+execlists context structs

struct intel_context contains two substructs, one for the legacy RCS and
one for every execlists engine. Since legacy RCS is a subset of the
execlists engine support, just combine the two substructs.

v2: Only pin the default context for legacy mode (the object only exists
for legacy, but adding i915.enable_execlists provides symmetry with the
cleanup functions).
