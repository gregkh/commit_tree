drm/i915: Track whether an atomic transaction changes the active CRTC's

For the purposes of DDB re-allocation we need to know whether a
transaction changes the list of CRTC's that are active.  While
state->modeset could be used for this purpose, that would be slightly
too aggressive since it would lead us to re-allocate the DDB when a
CRTC's mode changes, but not its final active state.
