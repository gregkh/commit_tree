x86/mm: Fix swap entry comment and macro

A recent patch changed the format of a swap PTE.

The comment explaining the format of the swap PTE is wrong about
the bits used for the swap type field.  Amusingly, the ASCII art
and the patch description are correct, but the comment itself
is wrong.

As I was looking at this, I also noticed that the
SWP_OFFSET_FIRST_BIT has an off-by-one error.  This does not
really hurt anything.  It just wasted a bit of space in the PTE,
giving us 2^59 bytes of addressable space in our swapfiles
instead of 2^60.  But, it doesn't match with the comments, and it
wastes a bit of space, so fix it.
