nvme-fabrics: add a generic NVMe over Fabrics library

The NVMe over Fabrics library provides an interface for both transports
and the nvme core to handle fabrics specific commands and attributes
independent of the underlying transport.

In addition, the fabrics library adds a misc device interface that allow
actually creating a fabrics controller, as we can't just autodiscover
it like in the PCI case.  The nvme-cli utility has been enhanced to use
this interface to support fabric connect and discovery.
