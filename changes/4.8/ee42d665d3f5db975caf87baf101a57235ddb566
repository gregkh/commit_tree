xen/pvhvm: run xen_vcpu_setup() for the boot CPU

Historically we didn't call VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info for CPU0 for
PVHVM guests (while we had it for PV and ARM guests). This is usually
fine as we can use vcpu info in the shared_info page but when we try
booting on a vCPU with Xen's vCPU id > 31 (e.g. when we try to kdump
after crashing on this CPU) we're not able to boot.

Switch to always doing VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info for the boot CPU.
