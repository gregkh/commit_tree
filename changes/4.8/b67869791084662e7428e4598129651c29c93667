iio: light: tcs3414: use iio helper function to guarantee direct mode

Replace the code that guarantees the device stays in direct mode
with iio_device_claim_direct_mode() which does same.  This allows
removal of an unused lock in the device private global data.

Also prevents a possible race around a buffer being enabled whilst
a read is going on.
