sparc64: Trim page tables for 8M hugepages

For PMD aligned (8M) hugepages, we currently allocate
all four page table levels which is wasteful. We now
allocate till PMD level only which saves memory usage
from page tables.

Also, when freeing page table for 8M hugepage backed region,
make sure we don't try to access non-existent PTE level.
