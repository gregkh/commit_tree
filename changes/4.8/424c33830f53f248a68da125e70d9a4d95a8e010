KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Implement basic ITS register handlers

Add emulation for some basic MMIO registers used in the ITS emulation.
This includes:
- GITS_{CTLR,TYPER,IIDR}
- ID registers
- GITS_{CBASER,CREADR,CWRITER}
  (which implement the ITS command buffer handling)
- GITS_BASER<n>

Most of the handlers are pretty straight forward, only the CWRITER
handler is a bit more involved by taking the new its_cmd mutex and
then iterating over the command buffer.
The registers holding base addresses and attributes are sanitised before
storing them.
