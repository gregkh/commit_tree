raid5: fix a small race condition

commit 5f9d1fde7d54a5(raid5: fix memory leak of bio integrity data)
moves bio_reset to bio_endio. But it introduces a small race condition.
It does bio_reset after raid5_release_stripe, which could make the
stripe reusable and hence reuse the bio just before bio_reset. Moving
bio_reset before raid5_release_stripe is called should fix the race.
