ALSA: ppc/awacs: shut up maybe-uninitialized warning

The awacs sound driver produces a false-positive warning in ppc64_defconfig:

sound/ppc/awacs.c: In function 'snd_pmac_awacs_init':
include/sound/control.h:219:9: warning: 'master_vol' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

I haven't come up with a good way to rewrite the code to avoid the
warning, so here is a bad one: I initialize the variable before
the conditionall initialization so gcc no longer has to worry about
it.
