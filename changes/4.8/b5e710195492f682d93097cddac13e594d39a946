IB/hfi1: Reset QSFP on every run through channel tuning

Active QSFP cables were reset only every alternate iteration of the
channel tuning algorithm instead of every iteration due to incorrect
reset of the flag that controlled QSFP reset, resulting in using stale
QSFP status in the channel tuning algorithm.
