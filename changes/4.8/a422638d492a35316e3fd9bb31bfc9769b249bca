ima: change integrity cache to store measured pcr

IMA avoids re-measuring files by storing the current state as a flag in
the integrity cache. It will then skip adding a new measurement log entry
if the cache reports the file as already measured.

If a policy measures an already measured file to a new PCR, the measurement
will not be added to the list. This patch implements a new bitfield for
specifying which PCR the file was measured into, rather than if it was
measured.
