qed: Fix removal of spoof checking for VFs

Driver has reverse logic for checking the result of the
spoof-checking configuration. As a result, it would log that
the configuration failed [even though it succeeded], and will
no longer do anything when requested to remove the configuration,
as it's accounting of the feature will be incorrect.
