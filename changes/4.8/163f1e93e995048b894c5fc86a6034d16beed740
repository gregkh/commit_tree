[media] media-devnode: fix namespace mess

Along all media controller code, "mdev" is used to represent
a pointer to struct media_device, and "devnode" for a pointer
to struct media_devnode.

However, inside media-devnode.[ch], "mdev" is used to represent
a pointer to struct media_devnode.

This is very confusing and may lead to development errors.

So, let's change all occurrences at media-devnode.[ch] to
also use "devnode" for such pointers.

This patch doesn't make any functional changes.
