mm, vmscan: remove duplicate logic clearing node congestion and dirty state

Reclaim may stall if there is too much dirty or congested data on a
node.  This was previously based on zone flags and the logic for
clearing the flags is in two places.  As congestion/dirty tracking is
now tracked on a per-node basis, we can remove some duplicate logic.
