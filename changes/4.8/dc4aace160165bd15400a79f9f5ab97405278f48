s390/uaccess: fix __put_get_user_asm define

The __put_get_user_asm defines an inline assmembly which makes use of
the asm register construct. The parameters passed to that define may
also contain function calls.

It is a gcc restriction that between register asm statements and the
use of any such annotated variables function calls may clobber the
register / variable contents. Or in other words: gcc would generate
broken code.

This can be achieved e.g. with the following code:

    get_user(x, func() ? a : b);

where the call of func would clobber register zero which is used by
the __put_get_user_asm define.
To avoid this add two static inline functions which don't have these
side effects.
