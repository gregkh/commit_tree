perf tests: Fix thread map test for -F option

I hit a bug when running test suite without forking each test (-F
option):

  $ perf test -Fv
  ...
  34: Test thread map                                          :
  --- start ---
  FAILED tests/thread-map.c:24 wrong comm
  ---- end ----
  Test thread map: FAILED!

The reason was the process name wasn't 'perf' as expected by the test,
because other tests set the name as well.

Setting it explicitly now.
