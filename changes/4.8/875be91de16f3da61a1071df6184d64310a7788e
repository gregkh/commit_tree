ARM: dts: sun5i: Rename sun5i-q8-common.dtsi sun5i-reference-design-tablet.dtsi

Rename sun5i-q8-common.dtsi to sun5i-reference-design-tablet.dtsi. This
is part of renaming all the sun?i-q8-common.dtsi files to
sun?i-reference-design-tablet.dtsi since most of the hw-config in there
is shared by all sunxi tablets.
