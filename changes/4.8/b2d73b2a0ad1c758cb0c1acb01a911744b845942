s390/mm: extended gmap pte notifier

The current gmap pte notifier forces a pte into to a read-write state.
If the pte is invalidated the gmap notifier is called to inform KVM
that the mapping will go away.

Extend this approach to allow read-write, read-only and no-access
as possible target states and call the pte notifier for any change
to the pte.

This mechanism is used to temporarily set specific access rights for
a pte without doing the heavy work of a true mprotect call.
