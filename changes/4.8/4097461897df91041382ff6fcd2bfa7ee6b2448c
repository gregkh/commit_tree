Input: i8042 - break load dependency between atkbd/psmouse and i8042

As explained in 1407814240-4275-1-git-send-email-decui@microsoft.com we
have a hard load dependency between i8042 and atkbd which prevents
keyboard from working on Gen2 Hyper-V VMs.

> hyperv_keyboard invokes serio_interrupt(), which needs a valid serio

To break the dependency we move away from using i8042_check_port_owner()
and instead allow serio port owner specify a mutex that clients should use
to serialize PS/2 command stream.
