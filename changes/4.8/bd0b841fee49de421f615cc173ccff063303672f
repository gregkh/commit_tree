nvme: make NVME_RDMA depend on BLOCK

Commit aa71987472a9 ("nvme: fabrics drivers don't need the nvme-pci
driver") removed the dependency on BLK_DEV_NVME, but the cdoe does
depend on the block layer (which used to be an implicit dependency
through BLK_DEV_NVME).

Otherwise you get various errors from the kbuild test robot random
config testing when that happens to hit a configuration with BLOCK
device support disabled.
