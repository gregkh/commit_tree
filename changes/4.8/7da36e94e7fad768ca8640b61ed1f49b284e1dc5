perf evsel: Fix write_backwards fallback

Commit b90dc17a5d14 "perf evsel: Add overwrite attribute and check
write_backward" misunderstood the 'order' should be obeyed in
__perf_evsel__open.

But the way this was done for attr.write_backwards was buggy, as we need
to check features in the inverse order of their introduction to the
kernel, so that a newer tool checks first the newest perf_event_attr
fields, detecting that the older kernel doesn't have support for them.

Also, we can avoid calling sys_perf_event_open() if we have already
detected the missing of write_backward.
