clk: samsung: make clk-s5pv210-audss explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/arm/mach-s5pv210/Kconfig:config ARCH_S5PV210
arch/arm/mach-s5pv210/Kconfig:  bool "Samsung S5PV210/S5PC110" if ARCH_MULTI_V7

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since this code is already not using module_init, case, the init
ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tags etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
