net: dsa: Split up creating/destroying of DSA and CPU ports

Refactor the code to setup a single DSA/CPU port into a function of
its own, and export it, so it can be used by the new binding.

Similarly, refactor the destroy code into a function.  When destroying
the ports, don't put the of node. They should be released at the end
along with the normal ports.
