lightnvm: remove _unlocked variant of [get/put]_blk

The [get/put]_blk API enables targets to get ownership of blocks at
runtime. This information is currently not recorded on disk, and the
information is therefore lost on power failure. To restore the
metadata, the [get/put]_blk must persist its metadata. In that case,
we need to control the outer lock, so that we can disable them while
updating the on-disk metadata. Fortunately, the _unlocked versions can
be removed, which allows us to move the lock into the [get/put]_blk
functions.
