libertas: Add spinlock to avoid race condition

lbs_mac_event_disconnected may free priv->currenttxskb
while lbs_hard_start_xmit accesses to it.
The patch adds a spinlock for mutual exclusion.

Tested on OLPC XO-1 (usb8388) and XO-1.5 (sd8686) with v4.7-rc3.

Confirmed that lbs_mac_event_disconnected is being called on the
station when hostapd on access point is given SIGHUP.
