rxrpc: Move usage count getting into rxrpc_queue_conn()

Rather than calling rxrpc_get_connection() manually before calling
rxrpc_queue_conn(), do it inside the queue wrapper.

This allows us to do some important fixes:

 (1) If the usage count is 0, do nothing.  This prevents connections from
     being reanimated once they're dead.

 (2) If rxrpc_queue_work() fails because the work item is already queued,
     retract the usage count increment which would otherwise be lost.

 (3) Don't take a ref on the connection in the work function.  By passing
     the ref through the work item, this is unnecessary.  Doing it in the
     work function is too late anyway.  Previously, connection-directed
     packets held a ref on the connection, but that's not really the best
     idea.

And another useful changes:

 (*) Don't need to take a refcount on the connection in the data_ready
     handler unless we invoke the connection's work item.  We're using RCU
     there so that's otherwise redundant.
