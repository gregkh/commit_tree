usb: gadget: move gadget API functions to udc-core

instead of defining all functions as static inlines,
let's move them to udc-core and export them with
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, that way we can make sure that
only GPL drivers will use them.

As a side effect, it'll be nicer to add tracepoints
to the gadget API.

While at that, also fix Kconfig dependencies to
avoid randconfig build failures.
