net: tracepoint napi:napi_poll add work and budget

An important information for the napi_poll tracepoint is knowing
the work done (packets processed) by the napi_poll() call. Add
both the work done and budget, as they are related.

Handle trace_napi_poll() param change in dropwatch/drop_monitor
and in python perf script netdev-times.py in backward compat way,
as python fortunately supports optional parameter handling.
