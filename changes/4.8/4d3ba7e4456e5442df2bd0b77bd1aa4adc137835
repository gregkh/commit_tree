drm/i915/guc: Use major_minor version for filename

Load guc firmware from file with major_minor number
in filename instead of using symolic link with only
major number.

This change is so that new firmwares can only be used
with a kernel change. This in case there is a regression
with a new firmware, it won't be used by default without
some testing.
