gpio: convince line to become input in irq helper

The generic IRQ helper library just checks if the IRQ line is
set as input before activating it for interrupts. As we
recently started to check things better with .get_dir() it
turns out that it's good to try to convince the line to become
an input before attempting to lock it as IRQ.
