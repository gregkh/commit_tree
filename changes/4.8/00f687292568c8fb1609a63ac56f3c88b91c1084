GPU-DRM-Radeon: Delete an unnecessary check before drm_gem_object_unreference_unlocked()

The drm_gem_object_unreference_unlocked() function tests whether
its argument is NULL and then returns immediately.
Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
