nvme-loop: fix nvme-loop Kconfig dependencies

I ran into the same problem on NVME_TARGET_RDMA now,
which otherwise needs dependencies on both CONFIG_BLOCK and
CONFIGFS_FS:

    warning: (NVME_TARGET_LOOP && NVME_TARGET_RDMA) selects NVME_TARGET which has unmet direct dependencies (BLOCK && CONFIGFS_FS)

Folding in my patch below should address that too.
