ARM: tegra: Initial support for Apalis TK1

This patch adds the device tree to support Toradex Apalis TK1 a
computer on module which can be used on different carrier boards.

The module consists of a Tegra TK1 SoC, a PMIC solution, 2 GB of DDR3L
RAM, a bunch of level shifters, an eMMC, a TMP451 temperature sensor
chip, an I210 gigabit Ethernet controller and a SGTL5000 audio codec.
Furthermore, there is a Kinetis MK20DN512 companion micro controller for
analogue, CAN and resistive touch functionality which is not yet
supported. Anything that is not self contained on the module is disabled
by default.

The device tree for the Evaluation Board includes the module's device
tree and enables the supported peripherals of the carrier board (the
Evaluation Board supports almost all of them).
