PCI: Bind DPC to Root Ports as well as Downstream Ports

PCIe port type values are not flags, so OR'ing them is not correct.
Previously the result was equivalent to PCIe Downstream Ports, so we were
missing binding to DPC-capable Root Ports.

Change the type to 'any' so we can bind to both port types.  While this
will cause the code to check Upstream Ports, the driver won't claim them
since they are not DPC-capable.
