x86/PCI: VMD: Fix infinite loop executing irq's

We can't initialize the list head on deletion as this causes the node to
point to itself, which causes an infinite loop if vmd_irq() happens to be
servicing that node.

The list initialization was trying to fix a bug from multiple calls to
disable the same IRQ.  Fix this instead by having the VMD driver track if
the interrupt is enabled.
