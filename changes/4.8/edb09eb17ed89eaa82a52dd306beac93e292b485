net: sched: do not acquire qdisc spinlock in qdisc/class stats dump

Large tc dumps (tc -s {qdisc|class} sh dev ethX) done by Google BwE host
agent [1] are problematic at scale :

For each qdisc/class found in the dump, we currently lock the root qdisc
spinlock in order to get stats. Sampling stats every 5 seconds from
thousands of HTB classes is a challenge when the root qdisc spinlock is
under high pressure. Not only the dumps take time, they also slow
down the fast path (queue/dequeue packets) by 10 % to 20 % in some cases.

An audit of existing qdiscs showed that sch_fq_codel is the only qdisc
that might need the qdisc lock in fq_codel_dump_stats() and
fq_codel_dump_class_stats()

In v2 of this patch, I now use the Qdisc running seqcount to provide
consistent reads of packets/bytes counters, regardless of 32/64 bit arches.

I also changed rate estimators to use the same infrastructure
so that they no longer need to lock root qdisc lock.
