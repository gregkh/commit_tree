mm, vmscan: have kswapd only scan based on the highest requested zone

kswapd checks all eligible zones to see if they need balancing even if
it was woken for a lower zone.  This made sense when we reclaimed on a
per-zone basis because we wanted to shrink zones fairly so avoid
age-inversion problems.  Ideally this is completely unnecessary when
reclaiming on a per-node basis.  In theory, there may still be anomalies
when all requests are for lower zones and very old pages are preserved
in higher zones but this should be the exceptional case.
