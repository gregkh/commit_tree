IB/core: Use memdup_user() rather than duplicating its implementation

* Reuse existing functionality from memdup_user() instead of keeping
  duplicate source code.

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* The local variable "ret" will be set to an appropriate value a bit later.
  Thus omit the explicit initialisation at the beginning.
