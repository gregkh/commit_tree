ARM: 8616/1: dt: Respect property size when parsing CPUs

Whilst MPIDR values themselves are less than 32 bits, it is still
perfectly valid for a DT to have #address-cells > 1 in the CPUs node,
resulting in the "reg" property having leading zero cell(s). In that
situation, the big-endian nature of the data conspires with the current
behaviour of only reading the first cell to cause the kernel to think
all CPUs have ID 0, and become resoundingly unhappy as a consequence.

Take the full property length into account when parsing CPUs so as to
be correct under any circumstances.
