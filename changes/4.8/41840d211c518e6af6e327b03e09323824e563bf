perf config: Move config declarations from util/cache.h to util/config.h

Lately util/config.h has been added but util/cache.h has declarations of
functions and a global variable for config features.

To manage codes about configuration at one spot, move them to
util/config.h and let source files that need config features include
config.h And if the source files that included previous cache.h need
only config.h, remove including cache.h.
