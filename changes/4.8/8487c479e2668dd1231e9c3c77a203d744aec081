NFSv4: Allow retry of operations that used a returned delegation stateid

Fix up nfs4_do_handle_exception() so that it can check if the operation
that received the NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID was using a defunct delegation.
Apply that to the case of SETATTR, which will currently return EIO
in some cases where this happens.
