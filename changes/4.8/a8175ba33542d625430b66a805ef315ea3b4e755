iio: ak8975: Support adapters limited to BYTE_DATA

The device has simple 8-bit registers but the driver incorrectly uses
block or word reads without checking functionality bits.

Fix by using i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated instead of
i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data or i2c_smbus_read_word_data. This will
check functionality bits and use the fastest available transfer method.
