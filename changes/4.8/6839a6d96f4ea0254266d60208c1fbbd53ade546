nfit: do an ARS scrub on hitting a latent media error

When a latent (unknown to 'badblocks') error is encountered, it will
trigger a machine check exception. On a system with machine check
recovery, this will only SIGBUS the process(es) which had the bad page
mapped (as opposed to a kernel panic on platforms without machine
check recovery features). In the former case, we want to trigger a full
rescan of that nvdimm bus. This will allow any additional, new errors
to be captured in the block devices' badblocks lists, and offending
operations on them can be trapped early, avoiding machine checks.

This is done by registering a callback function with the
x86_mce_decoder_chain and calling the new ars_rescan functionality with
the address in the mce notificatiion.
