pwm: lpss: Fix base_unit calculation for PWM frequency

The base_unit calculation applies an offset of 0x2 which adds
significant error for lower frequencies and doesn't appear to be
warranted - rounding the division result gives a correct value.

Also, the upper limit check for base_unit is off-by-one; the upper
nibble of base_unit is invalid if >=128 according to the Table 88
in the Z8000 Processor Series Datasheet Volume 1 (Rev. 2).

Verified on UP Board (Cherry Trail) and Minnowboard Max (Bay Trail).
