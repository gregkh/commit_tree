iio: pressure: bmp280: fix runtime suspend/resume crash

In commit 3d838118c6aa ("iio: pressure: bmp280: add power management")

For some reason the code in the runtime suspend/resume hooks
got wrong (I suspect in the ambition to cut down boilerplate)
and it seems it was tested without CONFIG_PM and crashes like
so for me:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000c
pgd = c0204000
[0000000c] *pgd=00000000

Dereferencing the BMP280 state container properly fixes the problem,
sorry for screwing up.
