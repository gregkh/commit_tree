ASoC: nau8825: change output power for interrupt

The interrupt clock is gated by x1[10:8], one of them needs to be enabled
all the time for interrupts to happen. We change codec to enable ADC
because it's helpful to reduce playback pop noise.
Don't use force enable pin to enable ADC instead of ADC widget event.
That won't interfere DAPM operation and let bias work normally.
