KVM: introduce kvm->created_vcpus

The race between creating the irqchip and the first VCPU is
currently fixed by checking the presence of an irqchip before
updating kvm->online_vcpus, and undoing the whole VCPU creation
if someone created the irqchip in the meanwhile.

Instead, introduce a new field in struct kvm that will count VCPUs
under a mutex, without the atomic access and memory ordering that we
need elsewhere to protect the vcpus array.  This also plugs the race
and is more easily applicable in all similar circumstances.
