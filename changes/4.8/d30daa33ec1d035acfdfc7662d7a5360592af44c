vfio: platform: call _RST method when using ACPI

The device tree code checks for the presence of a reset driver and calls
the of_reset function pointer by looking up the reset driver as a module.

ACPI defines _RST method to perform device level reset. After the _RST
method is executed, the OS can resume using the device. _RST method is
expected to stop DMA transfers and IRQs.

This patch introduces two functions as vfio_platform_acpi_has_reset and
vfio_platform_acpi_call_reset. The has reset method is used to declare
reset capability via the ioctl flag VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_RESET. The call
reset function is used to execute the _RST ACPI method.
