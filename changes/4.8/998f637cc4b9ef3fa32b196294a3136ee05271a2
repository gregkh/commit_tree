s390/mm: avoid races on region/segment/page table shadowing

We have to unlock sg->guest_table_lock in order to call
gmap_protect_rmap(). If we sleep just before that call, another VCPU
might pick up that shadowed page table (while it is not protected yet)
and use it.

In order to avoid these races, we have to introduce a third state -
"origin set but still invalid" for an entry. This way, we can avoid
another thread already using the entry before the table is fully protected.
As soon as everything is set up, we can clear the invalid bit - if we
had no race with the unshadowing code.
