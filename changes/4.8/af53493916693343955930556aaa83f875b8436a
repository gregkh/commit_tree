IB/hfi1: Fix AHG KDETH Intr shift

In the set_txreq_header_ahg(), The KDETH Intr bit is obtained from the
header in the user sdma request using a KDETH_GET shift and mask macro.
This value is then futher right shifted by 16 causing us to lose the
value i.e it is shifted to zero, leading to the following
smatch warning:
drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/user_sdma.c:1482 set_txreq_header_ahg()
warn: mask and shift to zero

The Intr bit should be left shifted into its correct position in the
KDETH header before the AHG update.
