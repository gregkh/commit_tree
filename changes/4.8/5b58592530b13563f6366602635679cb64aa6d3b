drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Queue hangcheck before sleeping

Never go to sleep waiting on the GPU without first ensuring that we will
get woken up.

We have a choice of queuing the hangcheck before every schedule() or the
first time we wakeup. In order to simply accommodate both the signaler
and the ordinary waiter, move the queuing to the common point of
enabling the irq. We lose the paranoid safety of ensuring that the
hangcheck is active before the sleep, but avoid code duplication (and
redundant hangcheck queuing).
