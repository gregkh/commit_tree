Revert "ARM: aspeed: adapt defconfigs for new CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME"

The patch that this was preparing for made it into neither v4.7 nor
v4.8, so we should back this out as well to avoid the opposite
warning:

  arch/arm/configs/aspeed_g5_defconfig:62:warning: symbol value '1' invalid for PRINTK_TIME
  arch/arm/configs/aspeed_g4_defconfig:61:warning: symbol value '1' invalid for PRINTK_TIME

Sorry for not catching this earlier.
