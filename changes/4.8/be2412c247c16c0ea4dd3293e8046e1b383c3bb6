s390/als: convert architecture level set code to C

There is no reason to have this code in assembly language. Therefore
convert it to C.

Note that this code needs special treatment: it is called very early
and one of the side effects is that e.g. the bss section is not
cleared. Therefore the preferred way for static variables is to put
them on the stack which has a size of 16KB.

There is no functional change with this patch.
