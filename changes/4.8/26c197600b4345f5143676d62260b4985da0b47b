ath10k: define an enum to enable cycle counter wraparound logic

QCA988X hw implements a different cycle counter wraparound
behaviour when compared to QCA4019. To properly handle different
wraparound logic for these chipsets replace already available
bool hw_params member, has_shifted_cc_wraparound, with an
enum which could be extended to handle different wraparound
behaviour. This patch keeps the existing logic functionally
same and a prepares cycle counter wraparound handling to
extend for other chips.
