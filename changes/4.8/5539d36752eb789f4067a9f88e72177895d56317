xfs: don't reset b_retries to 0 on every failure

With the code as it stands today, b_retries never increments because
it gets reset to 0 in the error callback.

Remove that, and fix a similar problem where the first retry time
was constantly being overwritten, which defeated the timeout tunable
as well.  We now only set first retry time if a non-zero timeout is
set, to match the behavior of only incrementing retries if a retry
value is set.

This way max retries & timeouts consistently take effect after a
tunable is set, rather than acting retroactively on a buffer which
has failed at some point in the past and has accumulated state from
those prior failures.

Thanks to dchinner for talking through this with me.
