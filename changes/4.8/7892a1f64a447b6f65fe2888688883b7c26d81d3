[media] rcar-fcp: Make sure rcar_fcp_enable() returns 0 on success

When resuming from suspend-to-RAM on r8a7795/salvator-x:

    dpm_run_callback(): pm_genpd_resume_noirq+0x0/0x90 returns 1
    PM: Device fe940000.fdp1 failed to resume noirq: error 1
    dpm_run_callback(): pm_genpd_resume_noirq+0x0/0x90 returns 1
    PM: Device fe944000.fdp1 failed to resume noirq: error 1
    dpm_run_callback(): pm_genpd_resume_noirq+0x0/0x90 returns 1
    PM: Device fe948000.fdp1 failed to resume noirq: error 1

According to its documentation, rcar_fcp_enable() returns 0 on success
or a negative error code if an error occurs.  Hence
fdp1_pm_runtime_resume() and vsp1_pm_runtime_resume() forward its return
value to their callers.

However, rcar_fcp_enable() forwards the return value of
pm_runtime_get_sync(), which can actually be 1 on success, leading to
the resume failure above.

To fix this, consider only negative values returned by
pm_runtime_get_sync() to be failures.
