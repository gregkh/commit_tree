powerpc/powernv/pci: Fix missed TCE invalidations that should fallback to OPAL

In commit f0228c413011 ("powerpc/powernv/pci: Fallback to OPAL for TCE
invalidations"), we added logic to fallback to OPAL for doing TCE
invalidations if we can't do it in Linux.

Ben sent a v2 of the patch, containing these additional call sites, but
I had already applied v1 and didn't notice. So fix them now.
