powerpc/mm: Don't alias user region to other regions below PAGE_OFFSET

In commit c60ac5693c47 ("powerpc: Update kernel VSID range", 2013-03-13)
we lost a check on the region number (the top four bits of the effective
address) for addresses below PAGE_OFFSET.  That commit replaced a check
that the top 18 bits were all zero with a check that bits 46 - 59 were
zero (performed for all addresses, not just user addresses).

This means that userspace can access an address like 0x1000_0xxx_xxxx_xxxx
and we will insert a valid SLB entry for it.  The VSID used will be the
same as if the top 4 bits were 0, but the page size will be some random
value obtained by indexing beyond the end of the mm_ctx_high_slices_psize
array in the paca.  If that page size is the same as would be used for
region 0, then userspace just has an alias of the region 0 space.  If the
page size is different, then no HPTE will be found for the access, and
the process will get a SIGSEGV (since hash_page_mm() will refuse to create
a HPTE for the bogus address).

The access beyond the end of the mm_ctx_high_slices_psize can be at most
5.5MB past the array, and so will be in RAM somewhere.  Since the access
is a load performed in real mode, it won't fault or crash the kernel.
At most this bug could perhaps leak a little bit of information about
blocks of 32 bytes of memory located at offsets of i * 512kB past the
paca->mm_ctx_high_slices_psize array, for 1 <= i <= 11.
