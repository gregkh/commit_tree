perf data ctf: Generate comm event to CTF output

If 'all' is selected, convert comm event to output CTF stream.

setup_non_sample_events() is called if non_sample is selected. It
creates a comm_class for comm event.

Use macros to generate and process_comm_event and add_comm_event. These
macros can be reused for other non-sample events.
