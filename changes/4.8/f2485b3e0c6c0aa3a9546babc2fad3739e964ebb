KVM: x86: use guest_exit_irqoff

This gains a few clock cycles per vmexit.  On Intel there is no need
anymore to enable the interrupts in vmx_handle_external_intr, since
we are using the "acknowledge interrupt on exit" feature.  AMD
needs to do that, and must be careful to avoid the interrupt shadow.
