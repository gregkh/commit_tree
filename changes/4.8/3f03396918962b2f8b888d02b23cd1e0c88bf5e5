media: vb2-dma-contig: add helper for setting dma max seg size

Add a helper function for device drivers to set DMA's max_seg_size.
Setting it to largest possible value lets DMA-mapping API always create
contiguous mappings in DMA address space. This is essential for all
devices, which use dma-contig videobuf2 memory allocator and shared
buffers.

Till now, the only case when vb2-dma-contig really 'worked' was a case
where userspace provided USERPTR buffer, which was in fact mmaped
contiguous buffer from the other v4l2/drm device. Also DMABUF made of
contiguous buffer worked only when its exporter did not split it into
several chunks in the scatter-list. Any other buffer failed, regardless
of the arch/platform used and the presence of the IOMMU of the device bus.

This patch provides interface to fix this issue.
