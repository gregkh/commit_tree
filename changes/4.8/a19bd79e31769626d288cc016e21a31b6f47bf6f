cxl: Allow a default context to be associated with an external pci_dev

The cxl kernel API has a concept of a default context associated with
each PCI device under the virtual PHB. The Mellanox CX4 will also use
the cxl kernel API, but it does not use a virtual PHB - rather, the AFU
appears as a physical function as a peer to the networking functions.

In order to allow the kernel API to work with those networking
functions, we will need to associate a default context with them as
well. To this end, refactor the corresponding code to do this in vphb.c
and export it so that it can be called from the PHB code.
