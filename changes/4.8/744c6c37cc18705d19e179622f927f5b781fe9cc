arm64: kernel: Fix unmasked debug exceptions when restoring mdscr_el1

Changes to make the resume from cpu_suspend() code behave more like
secondary boot caused debug exceptions to be unmasked early by
__cpu_setup(). We then go on to restore mdscr_el1 in cpu_do_resume(),
potentially taking break or watch points based on uninitialised registers.

Mask debug exceptions in cpu_do_resume(), which is specific to resume
from cpu_suspend(). Debug exceptions will be restored to their original
state by local_dbg_restore() in cpu_suspend(), which runs after
hw_breakpoint_restore() has re-initialised the other registers.
