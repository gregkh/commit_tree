spi: Prevent unexpected SPI time out due to arithmetic overflow

When reading SPI flash as MTD device, the transfer length is
directly passed to the spi driver. If the requested data size
exceeds 512KB, it will cause the time out calculation to
overflow since transfer length is 32-bit unsigned integer.
This issue is resolved by using 64-bit unsigned integer
to perform the arithmetic.
