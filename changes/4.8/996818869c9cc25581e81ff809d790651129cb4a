drm/i915: Avoid use-after-free of intel_encoder in intel_dp_connector_destrpy

The drm_dp_aux is associated with the intel_dp encoder and not the
connector. Since the encoder is destroyed before the connector,
attempting to free the drm_dp_aux from inside the connector cleanup
causes a use-after-free.

This was applied to the patch that CI was happy with, but in the
confusion of so many series trying to make CI happy, the unready
patch was plucked.
