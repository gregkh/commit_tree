timekeeping: Fix 1ns/tick drift with GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL_OLD

The user notices the problem in a raw and real time drift, calling
clock_gettime with CLOCK_REALTIME / CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW on a system
with no ntp correction taking place (no ntpd or ptp stuff running).

The problem is, that old_vsyscall_fixup adds an extra 1ns even though
xtime_nsec is already held in full nsecs and the remainder in this
case is 0. Do the rounding up buisness only if needed.
