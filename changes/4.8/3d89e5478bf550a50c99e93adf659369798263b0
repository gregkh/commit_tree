sched/cputime: Fix prev steal time accouting during CPU hotplug

Commit:

  e9532e69b8d1 ("sched/cputime: Fix steal time accounting vs. CPU hotplug")

... set rq->prev_* to 0 after a CPU hotplug comes back, in order to
fix the case where (after CPU hotplug) steal time is smaller than
rq->prev_steal_time.

However, this should never happen. Steal time was only smaller because of the
KVM-specific bug fixed by the previous patch.  Worse, the previous patch
triggers a bug on CPU hot-unplug/plug operation: because
rq->prev_steal_time is cleared, all of the CPU's past steal time will be
accounted again on hot-plug.

Since the root cause has been fixed, we can just revert commit e9532e69b8d1.
