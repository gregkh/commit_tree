[media] tw686x: use a formula instead of two tables for div

Instead of using two tables to estimate the temporal decimation
factor, use a formula. This allows to get the closest fps, which
sounds better than the current tables.

Also, the current code doesn't store the real framerate.

This patch fixes the above issues.

[Ezequiel:
  - introduce a TW686X_MAX_FPS macro for max_fps.
  - use hweight_long instead of open coding the set bits count.]
