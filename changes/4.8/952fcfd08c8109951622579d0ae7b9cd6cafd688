net: remove type_check from dev_get_nest_level()

The idea for type_check in dev_get_nest_level() was to count the number
of nested devices of the same type (currently, only macvlan or vlan
devices).
This prevented the false positive lockdep warning on configurations such
as:

eth0 <--- macvlan0 <--- vlan0 <--- macvlan1

However, this doesn't prevent a warning on a configuration such as:

eth0 <--- macvlan0 <--- vlan0
eth1 <--- vlan1 <--- macvlan1

In this case, all the locks end up with a nesting subclass of 1, so
lockdep thinks that there is still a deadlock:

- in the first case we have (macvlan_netdev_addr_lock_key, 1) and then
  take (vlan_netdev_xmit_lock_key, 1)
- in the second case, we have (vlan_netdev_xmit_lock_key, 1) and then
  take (macvlan_netdev_addr_lock_key, 1)

By removing the linktype check in dev_get_nest_level() and always
incrementing the nesting depth, lockdep considers this configuration
valid.
