net: macb: initialize checksum when using checksum offloading

I'm still struggling to get this fix right..

Changes since v2:
 - do not blindly modify SKB contents according to Dave's legitimate
   objection

Changes since v1:
 - dropped disabling HW checksum offload for Zynq
 - initialize checksum similar to net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c

MACB/GEM needs the checksum field initialized to 0 to get correct
results on transmit in all cases, e.g. on Zynq, UDP packets with
payload <= 2 otherwise contain a wrong checksums.
