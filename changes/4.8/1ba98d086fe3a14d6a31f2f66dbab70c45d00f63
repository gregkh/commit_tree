Btrfs: detect corruption when non-root leaf has zero item

Right now we treat leaf which has zero item as a valid one
because we could have an empty tree, that is, a root that is
also a leaf without any item, however, in the same case but
when the leaf is not a root, we can end up with hitting the
BUG_ON(1) in btrfs_extend_item() called by
setup_inline_extent_backref().

This makes us check the situation as a corruption if leaf is
not its own root.
