iio:core: timestamping clock selection support

Adds a new per-device sysfs attribute "current_timestamp_clock" to allow
userspace to select a particular POSIX clock for buffered samples and
events timestamping.

Following clocks, as listed in clock_gettime(2), are supported:
CLOCK_REALTIME, CLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW,
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE, CLOCK_BOOTTIME and
CLOCK_TAI.
