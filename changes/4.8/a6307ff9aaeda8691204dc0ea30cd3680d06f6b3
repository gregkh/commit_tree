staging/lustre/osc: osc_lock_weight endless loop fix

With huge number of pages to scan by osc_lock_weight() it is likely
CLP_GANG_RESCHED is returned from osc_page_gang_lookup() and the scan
will be repeated again from the start. To be sure that the scan is
progressing across those restarts, next scan should be started from
the last scanned page index plus one.
