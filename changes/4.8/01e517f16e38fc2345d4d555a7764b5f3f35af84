qed: potential overflow in qed_cxt_src_t2_alloc()

In the current code "ent_per_page" could be more than "conn_num" making
"conn_num" negative after the subtraction.  In the next iteration
through the loop then the negative is treated as a very high positive
meaning we don't put a limit on "ent_num".  It could lead to memory
corruption.
