efi/libstub: Allocate headspace in efi_get_memory_map()

efi_get_memory_map() allocates a buffer to store the memory map that it
retrieves.  This buffer may need to be reused by the client after
ExitBootServices() is called, at which point allocations are not longer
permitted.  To support this usecase, provide the allocated buffer size back
to the client, and allocate some additional headroom to account for any
reasonable growth in the map that is likely to happen between the call to
efi_get_memory_map() and the client reusing the buffer.
