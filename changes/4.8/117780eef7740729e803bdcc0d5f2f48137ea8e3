x86, asm: use bool for bitops and other assembly outputs

The gcc people have confirmed that using "bool" when combined with
inline assembly always is treated as a byte-sized operand that can be
assumed to be 0 or 1, which is exactly what the SET instruction
emits.  Change the output types and intermediate variables of as many
operations as practical to "bool".
