ACPI / EC: Work around method reentrancy limit in ACPICA for _Qxx

A regression is caused by the following commit:

  Commit: 02b771b64b73226052d6e731a0987db3b47281e9
  Subject: ACPI / EC: Fix an issue caused by the serialized _Qxx evaluations

In this commit, using system workqueue causes that the maximum parallel
executions of _Qxx can exceed 255. This violates the method reentrancy
limit in ACPICA and generates the following error log:

  ACPI Error: Method reached maximum reentrancy limit (255) (20150818/dsmethod-341)

This patch creates a seperate workqueue and limits the number of parallel
_Qxx evaluations down to a configurable value (can be tuned against number
of online CPUs).

Since EC events are handled after driver probe, we can create the workqueue
in acpi_ec_init().
