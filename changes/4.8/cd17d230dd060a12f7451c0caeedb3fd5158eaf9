net/mlx5e: Fix parsing of vlan packets when updating lro header

Currently vlan tagged packets were not parsed correctly
and assumed to be regular IPv4/IPv6 packets.
We should check for 802.1Q/802.1ad tags and update the lro header
accordingly.
This fixes the use case where LRO is on and rxvlan is off
(vlan stripping is off).
