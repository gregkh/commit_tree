net: hns: fix the wrong speed for bond

For debug-ports,there are two non-synchronized processes:
Speed-Auto-Negotiation and Link-Update-Status. The two
processes are towed by two different state machines.
Bond reads the speed when link up, but the speed maybe
not update the right value at that time.That make for bond's
wrong speed. Thus only one state machine should be used and
if phy_state_machine is used, it does not need to do
hns_nic_update_link_status().
