[media] cec: add MEDIA_SUPPORT dependency

The MEDIA_CEC_EDID option is guarded by MEDIA_SUPPORT, so selecting
it from MEDIA_CEC produces a warning:

warning: (MEDIA_CEC) selects MEDIA_CEC_EDID which has unmet direct dependencies (MEDIA_SUPPORT)

The warning is harmless, but it's better to add an explicit
dependency to shut it up, to reduce the noise during randconfig
builds.
