ovl: check mounter creds on underlying lookup

The hash salting changes meant that we can no longer reuse the hash in the
overlay dentry to look up the underlying dentry.

Instead of lookup_hash(), use lookup_one_len_unlocked() and swith to
mounter's creds (like we do for all other operations later in the series).

Now the lookup_hash() export introduced in 4.6 by 3c9fe8cdff1b ("vfs: add
lookup_hash() helper") is unused and can possibly be removed; its
usefulness negated by the hash salting and the idea that mounter's creds
should be used on operations on underlying filesystems.
