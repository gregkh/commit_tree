wil6210: protect wil_vring_fini_tx in parallel to tx completions

napi_synchronize is called before releasing the vring, with the
assumption that setting txdata->enabled to 0 will prevent handling
of this vring in the next scheduled napi.
To guarantee this assumption, a memory barrier is added after disabling
the txdata.
In addition, as the ctx is zeroed in wil_tx_complete after this
descriptor is handled (protected by wmb), ctx needs to be checked
before releasing this descriptor in wil_vring_free.
