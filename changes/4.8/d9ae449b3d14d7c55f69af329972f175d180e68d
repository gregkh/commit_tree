KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Make updates to propbaser/pendbaser atomic

There are two problems with the current implementation of the MMIO
handlers for the propbaser and pendbaser:

First, the write to the value itself is not guaranteed to be an atomic
64-bit write so two concurrent writes to the structure field could be
intermixed.

Second, because we do a read-modify-update operation without any
synchronization, if we have two 32-bit accesses to separate parts of the
register, we can loose one of them.

By using the atomic cmpxchg64 we should cover both issues above.
