KVM: s390: vsie: add indication for future features

We have certain SIE features that we cannot support for now.
Let's add these features, so user space can directly prepare to enable
them, so we don't have to update yet another component.

In addition, add a comment block, telling why it is for now not possible to
forward/enable these features.
