gre: set inner_protocol on xmit

Ensure that the inner_protocol is set on transmit so that GSO segmentation,
which relies on that field, works correctly.

This is achieved by setting the inner_protocol in gre_build_header rather
than each caller of that function. It ensures that the inner_protocol is
set when gre_fb_xmit() is used to transmit GRE which was not previously the
case.

I have observed this is not the case when OvS transmits GRE using
lwtunnel metadata (which it always does).
