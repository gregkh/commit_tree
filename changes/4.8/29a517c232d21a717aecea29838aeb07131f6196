kernfs: The cgroup filesystem also benefits from SB_I_NOEXEC

The cgroup filesystem is in the same boat as sysfs.  No one ever
permits executables of any kind on the cgroup filesystem, and there is
no reasonable future case to support executables in the future.

Therefore move the setting of SB_I_NOEXEC which makes the code proof
against future mistakes of accidentally creating executables from
sysfs to kernfs itself.  Making the code simpler and covering the
sysfs, cgroup, and cgroup2 filesystems.
