s390/mm: flush tlb of shadows in all situations

For now, the tlb of shadow gmap is only flushed when the parent is removed,
not when it is removed upfront. Therefore other shadow gmaps can reuse the
tables without the tlb getting flushed.

Fix this by simply flushing the tlb
1. Before the shadow tables are removed (analogouos to other unshadow functions)
2. When the gmap is freed and therefore the top level pages are freed.
