mem-hotplug: don't clear the only node in new_node_page()

Commit 394e31d2ceb4 ("mem-hotplug: alloc new page from a nearest
neighbor node when mem-offline") introduced new_node_page() for memory
hotplug.

In new_node_page(), the nid is cleared before calling
__alloc_pages_nodemask().  But if it is the only node of the system, and
the first round allocation fails, it will not be able to get memory from
an empty nodemask, and will trigger oom.

The patch checks whether it is the last node on the system, and if it
is, then don't clear the nid in the nodemask.
