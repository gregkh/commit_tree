fs/block_dev: fix potential NULL ptr deref in freeze_bdev()

Calling freeze_bdev() twice on the same block device without mounted
filesystem get_super() will return NULL, which will lead to NULL-ptr
dereference later in drop_super().

Check get_super() result to fix that.

Note, that this is a purely theoretical issue. We have only 3
freeze_bdev() callers. 2 of them are in filesystem code and used on a
device with mounted fs. The third one in lock_fs() has protection in
upper-layer code against freezing block device the second time without
thawing it first.
