nilfs2: move ioctl interface and disk layout to uapi separately

The header file "include/linux/nilfs2_fs.h" is composed of parts for
ioctl and disk format, and both are intended to be shared with user
space programs.

This moves them to the uapi directory "include/uapi/linux" splitting the
file to "nilfs2_api.h" and "nilfs2_ondisk.h".  The following minor
changes are accompanied by this migration:

 - nilfs_direct_node struct in nilfs2/direct.h is converged to
   nilfs2_ondisk.h because it's an on-disk structure.
 - inline functions nilfs_rec_len_from_disk() and
   nilfs_rec_len_to_disk() are moved to nilfs2/dir.c.
