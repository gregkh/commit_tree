drm/i915: Unify GPU resets upon shutdown

Both execlists and legacy need to reset the context (and mode) of the
GPU before we lose control of the system. By resetting the GPU, we
revert back to default settings. This simplifies the life of any
subsequent driver (in particular for virtualized setups) as it does not
then have to try and recover from an unknown condition. As both paths
need to reset for the same reason, move the reset to a common point.

This unifies the resets added in a647828afc (drm/i915: Also perform gpu
reset under execlist mode) and 8e96d9c4d9 (drm/i915: reset the GPU on
context fini).

v2: Restrict the reset to "modern" gen (where we enable HW contexts) to
try and avoid leaving the machine in an unusable state with a risky
reset on older GPU. This should keep the status quo as to who performs
resets (i.e. currently only GPUs with HW contexts perform a reset on
shutdown).
