drm: sti: use late_register and early_unregister callbacks

Make sti driver use register callback to move debugfs
initialization out of sub-components creation.
This will allow to convert driver .load() to
drm_dev_alloc() and drm_dev_register().

sti_compositor bring up 2 crtc but only one debugfs init is
needed so use drm_crtc_index to do it on the first one.
This can't be done in sti_drv because only sti_compositor have
access to the devices.
It is almost the same for sti_encoder which handle multiple
encoder while one only debugfs entry is needed so add a boolean
to avoid multiple debugfs initialization
