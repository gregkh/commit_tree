drbd: change bitmap write-out when leaving resync states

When leaving resync states because of disconnect,
do the bitmap write-out synchronously in the drbd_disconnected() path.

When leaving resync states because we go back to AHEAD/BEHIND, or
because resync actually finished, or some disk was lost during resync,
trigger the write-out from after_state_ch().

The bitmap write-out for resync -> ahead/behind was missing completely before.

Note that this is all only an optimization to avoid double-resyncs of
already completed blocks in case this node crashes.
