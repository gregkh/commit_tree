libfc: sanity check cpu number extracted from xid

In the receive path libfc extracts a cpu number from the ox_id in the
fiber channel header and uses that to do a per_cpu_ptr conversion.  If,
for some reason, a frame is received with an invalid ox_id, per_cpu_ptr
will return an invalid pointer and the libfc receive path will panic the
system trying to use it.

I'm currently looking at such a case, and I don't yet know why a cpu
number > nr_cpu_ids is appearing in an exchange id.  But adding a sanity
check in libfc prevents a system panic, and seems like good idea when
dealing with frames coming in from the network.
