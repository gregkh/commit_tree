x86/platform: Delete extraneous MODULE_* tags fromm ts5500

This file doesn't do anything modular and hence while the tristate
Kconfig used for the gpio portion is fine, it recently got swept up in
an audit of files using the module.h header but not using any modular
registration functions.

However it is not compiled in any of the normal build coverage, and
so some remaining extraneous MODULE macro use were not found until a
randconfig from the kbuild robot came across it.

Here we remove the remaining no-op MODULE macros from the built in
portion of code relating to this Kconfig option.
