tpm/st33zp24/i2c: Drop two useless checks in ACPI probe path

When st33zp24_i2c_acpi_request_resources() gets called we
already know that the entries in ->acpi_match_table have matched ACPI ID
of the device.
In addition I2C client pointer cannot be NULL in any case (otherwise I2C
core would not call ->probe() for the driver in the first place).

Drop the two useless checks from the driver.
