i2c: i801: recover from hardware PEC errors

On a CRC error while using hardware-supported PEC, an additional
error bit is set in the auxiliary status register.  If this bit
isn't cleared, all subsequent operations will fail, essentially
hanging the controller.

The fix is simple: check, report, and clear the bit in
i801_check_post().  Also, in case the driver starts with the
hardware in that state, clear it in i801_check_pre() as well.
