i2c: rk3x: Move spec timing data to "static const" structs

The i2c timing specs are really just constant data. There's no reason
to write code to init them, so move them out to structures. This not
only is a cleaner solution but it will reduce code duplication when we
introduce a new variant of rk3x_i2c_calc_divs() in a future patch.
