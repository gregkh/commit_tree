drm/i915: Remove the dedicated hangcheck workqueue

The queue only ever contains at most one item and has no special flags.
It is just a very simple wrapper around the system-wq - a complication
with no benefits.

v2: Use the system_long_wq as we may wish to capture the error state
after detecting the hang - which may take a bit of time.
