PM / devfreq: make devfreq explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

menuconfig PM_DEVFREQ
      bool "Generic Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

This code wasn't using module_init, so we don't need to be concerned
with altering the initcall level here.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
But we do add export.h since this file does export some symbols.
