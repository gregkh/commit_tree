parisc: Fix order of EREFUSED define in errno.h

When building gccgo in userspace, errno.h gets parsed and the go include file
sysinfo.go is generated.

Since EREFUSED is defined to the same value as ECONNREFUSED, and ECONNREFUSED
is defined later on in errno.h, this leads to go complaining that EREFUSED
isn't defined yet.

Fix this trivial problem by moving the define of EREFUSED down after
ECONNREFUSED in errno.h (and clean up the indenting while touching this line).
