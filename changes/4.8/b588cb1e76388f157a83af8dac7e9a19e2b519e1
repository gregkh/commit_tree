pinctrl: imx51: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/pinctrl/freescale/Kconfig:config PINCTRL_IMX51
drivers/pinctrl/freescale/Kconfig:	bool "IMX51 pinctrl driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init was not in use by this driver, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
