xfs: introduce interval queries on btrees

Create a function to enable querying of btree records mapping to a
range of keys.  This will be used in subsequent patches to allow
querying the reverse mapping btree to find the extents mapped to a
range of physical blocks, though the generic code can be used for
any range query.

The overlapped query range function needs to use the btree get_block
helper because the root block could be an inode, in which case
bc_bufs[nlevels-1] will be NULL.
