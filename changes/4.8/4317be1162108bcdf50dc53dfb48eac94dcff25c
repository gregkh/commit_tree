ARM: dts: am33xx: Move to operating-points-v2 table and ti-cpufreq driver

Drop the operating-points table present in am33xx.dtsi and add an
operating-points-v2 table with all OPPs available for all silicon
revisions along with necessary data for use by ti-cpufreq to selectively
enable the appropriate OPPs at runtime. Also, drop the voltage-tolerance
value and provide voltages for each OPP using the <target min max>
format instead.

Information from AM335x Data Manual, SPRS717i, Revised December 2015,
Table 5-7.
