ASoC: cs53l30: Set idle_bias_off true

The driver is using the set_bias_level to control the power on and
off so it should get SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in order to proceed normal
powering sequences. This patch enables the idle_bias_off option so
the DAPM core will set the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF instead
of stopping at SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY.
