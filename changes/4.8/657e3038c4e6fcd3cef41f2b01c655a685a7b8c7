shmem, thp: respect MADV_{NO,}HUGEPAGE for file mappings

Let's wire up existing madvise() hugepage hints for file mappings.

MADV_HUGEPAGE advise shmem to allocate huge page on page fault in the
VMA.  It only has effect if the filesystem is mounted with huge=advise
or huge=within_size.

MADV_NOHUGEPAGE prevents hugepage from being allocated on page fault in
the VMA.  It doesn't prevent a huge page from being allocated by other
means, i.e.  page fault into different mapping or write(2) into file.
