tpm/tpm_tis: Split tpm_tis driver into a core and TCG TIS compliant phy

To avoid code duplication between the old tpm_tis and the new and future
native tcg tis driver(ie: spi, i2c...), the tpm_tis driver was reworked,
so that all common logic is extracted and can be reused from all drivers.

The core methods can also be used from other TIS like drivers.

itpm workaround is now managed with a specific tis flag
TPM_TIS_ITPM_POSSIBLE.

This commit is based on the initial work by Peter Huewe.
