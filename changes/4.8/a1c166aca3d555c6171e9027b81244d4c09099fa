pinctrl: qcom: msm8974: Add hsic_ctl pinmux

The msm8974 pinctrl variant has a couple USB HSIC "glue"
registers that let us mux between the pinctrl register settings
or the HSIC core settings for the HSIC pins (gpio 144 and gpio
145). Support this method of operation by adding hsic_data and
hsic_strobe pins that can select between hsic_ctl and gpio
functions. This allows us to toggle the hsic pin configuration
over to the HSIC core at runtime.
