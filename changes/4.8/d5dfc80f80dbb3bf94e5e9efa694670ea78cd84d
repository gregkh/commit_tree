dma-debug: track bucket lock state for static checkers

get_hash_bucket() and put_hash_bucket() acquire and release the same
spinlock, but this confuses static checkers such as sparse

  lib/dma-debug.c:254:27: warning: context imbalance in 'get_hash_bucket' - wrong count at exit
  lib/dma-debug.c:268:13: warning: context imbalance in 'put_hash_bucket' - unexpected unlock

Add the appropriate acquire and release statements so that checkers can
properly track the lock state.
