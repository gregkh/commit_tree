mlxsw: spectrum: Set port type before setting its address

During port init, we currently set the port's type to Ethernet after
setting its MAC address. However, the hardware documentation states this
should be the other way around.

Align the driver with the hardware documentation and set the port's MAC
address after setting its type.
