Btrfs: cleanup BUG_ON in merge_bio

One can use btrfs-corrupt-block to hit BUG_ON() in merge_bio(),
thus this aims to stop anyone to panic the whole system by using
 their btrfs.

Since the error in merge_bio can only come from __btrfs_map_block()
when chunk tree mapping has something insane and __btrfs_map_block()
has already had printed the reason, we can just return errors in
merge_bio.
