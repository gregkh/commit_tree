ARM: dts: imx6sx-sabreauto: Fix misspelled property

In commit 99fc5ba0bfb6 ("ARM: dts: imx6sx: add i.mx6sx sabreauto board
support") it should've been enable-sdio-wakeup (not -wakup). But that is
now considered a legacy name for wakeup-source, so directly use the new
name instead, as done in commit 26cefdd15db1 for the other occurrence.

Fixes: 26cefdd15db1 ("ARM: dts: imx: replace legacy wakeup property with 'wakeup-source'")
