perf/core: Change log level for duration warning to KERN_INFO

When the perf interrupt handler exceeds a threshold warning messages
are displayed on console:

  [12739.31793] perf interrupt took too long (2504 > 2500), lowering kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate to 50000
  [71340.165065] perf interrupt took too long (5005 > 5000), lowering kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate to 25000

Many customers and users are confused by the message wondering if
something is wrong or they need to take action to fix a problem.
Since a user can not do anything to fix the issue, the message is really
more informational than a warning. Adjust the log level accordingly.
