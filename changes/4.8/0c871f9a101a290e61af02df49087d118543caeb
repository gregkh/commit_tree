xfs: remove spurious shutdown type check from xfs_bmap_finish()

The static checker reports that after commit 8d99fe92fed0 ("xfs: fix
efi/efd error handling to avoid fs shutdown hangs"), the code has been
reworked such that error == -EFSCORRUPTED is not possible in this
codepath.

Remove the spurious error check and just use SHUTDOWN_META_IO_ERROR
unconditionally.
