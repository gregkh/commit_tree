ntb_perf: clear link_is_up flag when the link goes down.

When the link goes down, the link_is_up flag did not return to
false. This could have caused some subtle corner case bugs
when the link goes up and down quickly.

Once that was fixed, there was found to be a race if the link was
brought down then immediately up. The link_cleanup work would
occasionally be scheduled after the next link up event. This would
cancel the link_work that was supposed to occur and leave ntb_perf
in an unusable state.

To fix this we get rid of the link_cleanup work and put the actions
directly in the link_down event.
