netfilter: x_tables: fix possible ZERO_SIZE_PTR pointer dereferencing error.

Since we cannot make sure that the 'hook_mask' will always be none
zero here. If it equals to zero, the num_hooks will be zero too,
and then kmalloc() will return ZERO_SIZE_PTR, which is (void *)16.

Then the following error check will fails:
  ops = kmalloc(sizeof(*ops) * num_hooks, GFP_KERNEL);
  if (ops == NULL)
          return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);

So this patch will fix this with just doing the zero check before
kmalloc() is called.

Maybe the case above will never happen here, but in theory.
