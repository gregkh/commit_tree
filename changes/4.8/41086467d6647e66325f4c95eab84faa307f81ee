qed: Make PF more robust against malicious VF

There are several requests the VF can make toward the PF which the driver
would pass to firmware without checking the validity first - specifically,
opening queues and updating vports. Such configurations might cause the
firmware to assert.

This adds validation of the legality of said configurations on the PF side
before passing it onward via ramrod to firmware.
