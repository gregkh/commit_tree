libnvdimm, nfit: move flush hint mapping to region-device driver-data

In preparation for triggering flushes of a DIMM's writes-posted-queue
(WPQ) via the pmem driver move mapping of flush hint addresses to the
region driver.  Since this uses devm_nvdimm_memremap() the flush
addresses will remain mapped while any region to which the dimm belongs
is active.

We need to communicate more information to the nvdimm core to facilitate
this mapping, namely each dimm object now carries an array of flush hint
address resources.
