net: ipv4: Add ability to have GRE ignore DF bit in IPv4 payloads

    In the presence of firewalls which improperly block ICMP Unreachable
    (including Fragmentation Required) messages, Path MTU Discovery is
    prevented from working.

    A workaround is to handle IPv4 payloads opaquely, ignoring the DF bit--as
    is done for other payloads like AppleTalk--and doing transparent
    fragmentation and reassembly.

    Redux includes the enforcement of mutual exclusion between this feature
    and Path MTU Discovery as suggested by Alexander Duyck.
