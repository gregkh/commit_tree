IB/uverbs: Fix race between uverbs_close and remove_one

Fixes an oops that might happen if uverbs_close races with
remove_one.

Both contexts may run ib_uverbs_cleanup_ucontext, it depends
on the flow.

Currently, there is no protection for a case that remove_one
didn't make the cleanup it runs to its end, the underlying
ib_device was freed then uverbs_close will call
ib_uverbs_cleanup_ucontext and OOPs.

Above might happen if uverbs_close deleted the file from the list
then remove_one didn't find it and runs to its end.

Fixes to protect against that case by a new cleanup lock so that
ib_uverbs_cleanup_ucontext will be called always before that
remove_one is ended.
