crypto: s5p-sss - Use consistent indentation for variables and members

Bring some consistency by:
1. Replacing fixed-space indentation of structure members with just
   tabs.
2. Remove indentation in declaration of local variable between type and
   name.  Driver was mixing usage of such indentation and lack of it.
   When removing indentation, reorder variables in
   reversed-christmas-tree order with first variables being initialized
   ones.
