pinctrl: imx1: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/pinctrl/freescale/Kconfig:config PINCTRL_IMX1
drivers/pinctrl/freescale/Kconfig:	bool "IMX1 pinctrl driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
