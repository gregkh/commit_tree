selftests/powerpc: Add a test for PROT_SAO

PROT_SAO is a powerpc-specific flag to mmap(), and we rely on arch
specific logic to allow it to be passed to mmap().

Add a small test to ensure mmap() accepts PROT_SAO. We don't have a good
way to test that it actually causes the mapping to be created with the
right flags, so for now we just touch the mapping so it's faulted in. In
future we might be able to do something better.
