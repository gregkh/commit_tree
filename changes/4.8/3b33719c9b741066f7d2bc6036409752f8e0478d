thp: move shmem_huge_enabled() outside of SYSFS ifdef

The newly introduced shmem_huge_enabled() function has two definitions,
but neither of them is visible if CONFIG_SYSFS is disabled, leading to a
build error:

  mm/khugepaged.o: In function `khugepaged':
  khugepaged.c:(.text.khugepaged+0x3ca): undefined reference to `shmem_huge_enabled'

This changes the #ifdef guards around the definition to match those that
are used in the header file.
