powerpc/powernv: Fix corrupted PE allocation bitmap on releasing PE

In pnv_ioda_free_pe(), the PE object (including the associated PE
number) is cleared before resetting the corresponding bit in the
PE allocation bitmap. It means PE#0 is always released to the bitmap
wrongly.

This fixes above issue by caching the PE number before the PE object
is cleared.
