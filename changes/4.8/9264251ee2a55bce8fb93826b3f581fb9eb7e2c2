bridge: re-introduce 'fix parsing of MLDv2 reports'

commit bc8c20acaea1 ("bridge: multicast: treat igmpv3 report with
INCLUDE and no sources as a leave") seems to have accidentally reverted
commit 47cc84ce0c2f ("bridge: fix parsing of MLDv2 reports"). This
commit brings back a change to br_ip6_multicast_mld2_report() where
parsing of MLDv2 reports stops when the first group is successfully
added to the MDB cache.

Fixes: bc8c20acaea1 ("bridge: multicast: treat igmpv3 report with INCLUDE and no sources as a leave")
