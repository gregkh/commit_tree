KVM: arm/arm64: The GIC is dead, long live the GIC

I don't think any single piece of the KVM/ARM code ever generated
as much hatred as the GIC emulation.

It was written by someone who had zero experience in modeling
hardware (me), was riddled with design flaws, should have been
scrapped and rewritten from scratch long before having a remote
chance of reaching mainline, and yet we supported it for a good
three years. No need to mention the names of those who suffered,
the git log is singing their praises.

Thankfully, we now have a much more maintainable implementation,
and we can safely put the grumpy old GIC to rest.

Fellow hackers, please raise your glass in memory of the GIC:

	The GIC is dead, long live the GIC!
