s390/mm: fix compile for PAGE_DEFAULT_KEY != 0

The usual problem for code that is ifdef'ed out is that it doesn't
compile after a while. That's also the case for the storage key
initialisation code, if it would be used (set PAGE_DEFAULT_KEY to
something not zero):

./arch/s390/include/asm/page.h: In function 'storage_key_init_range':
./arch/s390/include/asm/page.h:36:2: error: implicit declaration of function '__storage_key_init_range'

Since the code itself has been useful for debugging purposes several
times, remove the ifdefs and make sure the code gets compiler
coverage. The cost for this is eight bytes.
