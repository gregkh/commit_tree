ipmi: remove trydefaults parameter and default init

Parameter trydefaults=1 causes the ipmi_init to initialize ipmi through
the legacy port io space that was designated for ipmi. Architectures
that do not map legacy port io can panic when trydefaults=1.

Rather than implement build-time conditional exceptions for each
architecture that does not map legacy port io, we have removed legacy
port io from the driver.

Parameter 'trydefaults' has been removed. Attempts to use it hereafter
will evoke the "Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter" message.

The patch was built against a number of architectures and tested for
regressions and functionality on x86_64 and ARM64.

Removed the config entry and the address source entry for default,
since neither were used any more.
