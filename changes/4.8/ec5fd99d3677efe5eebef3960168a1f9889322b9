tpm: drop int_queue from tpm_vendor_specific

Drop field int_queue from tpm_vendor_specific as it is used only by
tpm_tis. Probably all of the fields should be eventually dropped and
moved to the private structures of different drivers but it is better to
do this one step at a time in order not to break anything.
