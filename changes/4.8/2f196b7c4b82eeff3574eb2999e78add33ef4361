drm/atomic: Add drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane_state

... and use it in msm&vc4. Again just want to encapsulate
drm_atomic_state internals a bit.

The const threading is a bit awkward in vc4 since C sucks, but I still
think it's worth to enforce this. Eventually I want to make all the
obj->state pointers const too, but that's a lot more work ...

v2: Provide safe macro to wrap up the unsafe helper better, suggested
by Maarten.

v3: Fixup subject (Maarten) and spelling fixes (Eric Engestrom).
