net: fjes: fjes_main: Remove create_workqueue

alloc_workqueue replaces deprecated create_workqueue().

The workqueue adapter->txrx_wq has workitem
&adapter->raise_intr_rxdata_task per adapter. Extended Socket Network
Device is shared memory based, so someone's transmission denotes other's
reception.  raise_intr_rxdata_task raises interruption of receivers from
the sender in order to notify receivers.

The workqueue adapter->control_wq has workitem
&adapter->interrupt_watch_task per adapter. interrupt_watch_task is used
to prevent delay of interrupts.

Dedicated workqueues have been used in both cases since the workitems
on the workqueues are involved in normal device operation and require
forward progress under memory pressure.

max_active has been set to 0 since there is no need for throttling
the number of active work items.

Since network devices  may be used for memory reclaim,
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to guarantee forward progress.
