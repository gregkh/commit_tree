perf symbols: Introduce filename__readable to check readability

Introduce filename__readable to check readability by opening the file
directly. Since the access(R_OK) just checks the readability based on
real UID/GID, it is ignored that the effective UID/GID and capabilities
for some special file (e.g.  /proc/kcore).

filename__readable() directly opens given file with O_RDONLY so that the
kernel checks it by effective UID/GID and capabilities.
