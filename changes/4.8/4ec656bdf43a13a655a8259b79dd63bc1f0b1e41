EDAC, skx_edac: Add EDAC driver for Skylake

This is an entirely new driver instead of yet another set of patches
to sb_edac.c because:

1) Mapping from PCI devices to socket/memory controller is significantly
   different. Skylake scatters devices on a socket across a number of
   PCI buses.
2) There is an extra level of interleaving via the "mcroute" register
   that would be a little messy to squeeze into the old driver.
3) Validation is getting too expensive. Changes to sb_edac need to
   be checked against Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell and
   Knights Landing.
