ipvs: count pre-established TCP states as active

Some users observed that "least connection" distribution algorithm doesn't
handle well bursts of TCP connections from reconnecting clients after
a node or network failure.

This is because the algorithm counts active connection as worth 256
inactive ones where for TCP, "active" only means TCP connections in
ESTABLISHED state. In case of a connection burst, new connections are
handled before previous ones have finished the three way handshaking so
that all are still counted as "inactive", i.e. cheap ones. The become
"active" quickly but at that time, all of them are already assigned to one
real server (or few), resulting in highly unbalanced distribution.

Address this by counting the "pre-established" states as "active".
