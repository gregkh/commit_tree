nvmem: Declare nvmem_cell_read() consistently

nvmem_cell_read() is declared as void * if CONFIG_NVMEM is enabled, and
as char * otherwise. This can result in a build warning if CONFIG_NVMEM
is not enabled and a caller asigns the result to a type other than char *
without using a typecast. Use a consistent declaration to avoid the
problem.
