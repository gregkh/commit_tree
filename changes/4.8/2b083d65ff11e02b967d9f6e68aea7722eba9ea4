EDAC, altera: Add panic flag check to A10 IRQ

In preparation for additional memory module ECCs, the IRQ function will
check a panic flag before doing a kernel panic on double bit errors.

OCRAM uncorrectable errors cause a panic because sleep/resume functions
and FPGA contents during sleep are stored in OCRAM.

ECCs on peripheral FIFO buffers will not cause a kernel panic on DBERRs
because the packet can be retried and therefore recovered.
