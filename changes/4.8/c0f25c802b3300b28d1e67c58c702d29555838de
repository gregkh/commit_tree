batman-adv: Include frame priority in fragment header

Unfragmented frames which traverse a node have their skb->priority set
by looking at the IP ToS byte, or the 802.1p header. However for
fragments this is not possible, only one of the fragments will contain
the headers. Instead, place the priority into the fragment header and
on receiving a fragment, use this information to set the skb->priority
for when the fragment is forwarded.
