powerpc/32: Fix crash during static key init

We cannot do those initializations from apply_feature_fixups() as
this function runs in a very restricted environment on 32-bit where
the kernel isn't running at its linked address and the PTRRELOC()
macro must be used for any global accesss.

Instead, split them into a separtate steup_feature_keys() function
which is called in a more suitable spot on ppc32.
