doc/sphinx: Pass right filename as source

With this error output becomes almost readable. The line numbers are
still totally bonghits, but that's a lot harder to pull out of
kerneldoc. We'd essentially have to insert some special markers in the
kernel-doc output, split the output along these markers and then
insert each block separately using

     state_machine.insert_input(block, source, first_line)
