ima: redefine duplicate template entries

Template entry duplicates are prevented from being added to the
measurement list by checking a hash table that contains the template
entry digests. However, the PCR value is not included in this comparison,
so duplicate template entry digests with differing PCRs may be dropped.

This patch redefines duplicate template entries as template entries with
the same digest and same PCR values.
