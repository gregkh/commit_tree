powerpc/powernv: set power_save func after the idle states are initialized

pnv_init_idle_states() discovers supported idle states from the
device tree and does the required initialization. Set power_save
function pointer only after this initialization is done

Otherwise on machines which don't support nap, eg. Power9, the kernel
will crash when it tries to nap.
