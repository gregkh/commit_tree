vhost_net: stop polling socket during rx processing

We don't stop rx polling socket during rx processing, this will lead
unnecessary wakeups from under layer net devices (E.g
sock_def_readable() form tun). Rx will be slowed down in this
way. This patch avoids this by stop polling socket during rx
processing. A small drawback is that this introduces some overheads in
light load case because of the extra start/stop polling, but single
netperf TCP_RR does not notice any change. In a super heavy load case,
e.g using pktgen to inject packet to guest, we get about ~8.8%
improvement on pps:

before: ~1240000 pkt/s
after:  ~1350000 pkt/s
