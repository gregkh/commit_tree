ACPI / NUMA: Replace ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() with pr_debug()

ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT is a bit fragile in acpi/numa.c, the first thing
is that component ACPI_NUMA(0x80000000) is not described in the
Documentation/acpi/debug.txt, and even not defined in the struct
acpi_dlayer acpi_debug_layers which we can not dynamically enable/disable
it with /sys/modules/acpi/parameters/debug_layer. another thing
is that ACPI_DEBUG_OUTPUT is controlled by ACPICA which not coordinate
well with ACPI drivers.

Replace ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() with pr_debug() in this patch as pr_debug
will do the same thing for debug purpose and it can make the code much
cleaner, also remove the related code which not needed anymore if
ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() is gone.
