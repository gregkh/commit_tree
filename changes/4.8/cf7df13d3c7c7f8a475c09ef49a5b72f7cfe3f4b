arm64: KVM: Always reference __hyp_panic_string via its kernel VA

__hyp_panic_string is passed via the HYP panic code to the panic
function, and is being "upgraded" to a kernel address, as it is
referenced by the HYP code (in a PC-relative way).

This is a bit silly, and we'd be better off obtaining the kernel
address and not mess with it at all. This patch implements this
with a tiny bit of asm glue, by forcing the string pointer to be
read from the literal pool.
