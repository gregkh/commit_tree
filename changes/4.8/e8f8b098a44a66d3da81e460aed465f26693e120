IB/rdmavt: Add mechanism to invalidate MR keys

In order to support extended memory management, add the mechanism to
invalidate MR keys. This includes a flag "lkey_invalid" in the MR data
structure that is to be checked when validating access to the MR via
the associated key, and two utility functions to perform fast memory
registration and memory key invalidate operations.
