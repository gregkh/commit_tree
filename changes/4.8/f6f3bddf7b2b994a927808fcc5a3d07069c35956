pwm: Add relative duty cycle manipulation helpers

The PWM framework expects PWM users to configure the duty cycle in nano-
seconds, but many users want to express the duty cycle relatively to the
period value (i.e. duty_cycle = 33% of the period).

Add the pwm_{get,set}_relative_duty_cycle() helpers to ease this kind of
conversion.
