x86/tsc_msr: Remove debugging messages

Debugging messages are not necessary after all of the
possible hardware failures that never occur.
Instead, this code can simply return 0.

This code also doesn't need to print in the success case.
tsc_init() already prints the TSC frequency,
and apic=debug is available if anybody really is
interested in printing the LAPIC frequency.
