drm/vc4: Delete unnecessary checks before two function calls

The following functions test whether their argument is NULL
and then return immediately.
* drm_fbdev_cma_hotplug_event
* drm_fbdev_cma_restore_mode

Thus the tests around their calls are not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
