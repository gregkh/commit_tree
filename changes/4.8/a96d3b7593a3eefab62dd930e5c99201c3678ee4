dm9000: Fix irq trigger type setup on non-dt platforms

Commit b5a099c67a1c36b "net: ethernet: davicom: fix devicetree irq
resource" causes an interrupt storm after the ethernet interface
is activated on S3C24XX platform (ARM non-dt), due to the interrupt
trigger type not being set properly.

It seems, after adding parsing of IRQ flags in commit 7085a7401ba54e92b
"drivers: platform: parse IRQ flags from resources", there is no path
for non-dt platforms where irq_set_type callback could be invoked when
we don't pass the trigger type flags to the request_irq() call.

In case of a board where the regression is seen the interrupt trigger
type flags are passed through a platform device's resource and it is
not currently handled properly without passing the irq trigger type
flags to the request_irq() call.  In case of OF an of_irq_get() call
within platform_get_irq() function seems to be ensuring required irq_chip
setup, but there is no equivalent code for non OF/ACPI platforms.

This patch mostly restores irq trigger type setting code which has been
removed in commit ("net: ethernet: davicom: fix devicetree irq resource").
