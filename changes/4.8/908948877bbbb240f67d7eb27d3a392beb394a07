IB/rxe: Fix duplicate atomic request handling

When handling ack for atomic opcodes like "fetch&add"
or "cmp&swp", the method send_atomic_ack() saves the ack
before sending it, in case it gets lost and never reach the
requester. In which case the method duplicate_request()
will need to find it using the duplicated request.psn.
But send_atomic_ack() used a wrong psn value and thus
the above ack was never found.
This fix uses the ack.psn to locate the ack in case
its needed.
This fix also copies the ack packet to the skb's control buffer
since duplicate_request() will need it when calling rxe_xmit_packet()
