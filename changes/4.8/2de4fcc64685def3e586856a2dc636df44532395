Input: elan_i2c - properly wake up touchpad on ASUS laptops

Some ASUS laptops were shipped with touchpads that require to be woken up
first, before trying to switch them into absolute reporting mode, otherwise
touchpad would fail to work while flooding the logs with:

Among affected devices are Asus E202SA, N552VW, X456UF, UX305CA, and
others. We detect such devices by checking the IC type and product ID
numbers and adjusting order of operations accordingly.
