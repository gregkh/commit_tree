HSI: cmt_speech: Fix double spin_lock

Release &hi->lock before calling `cs_hsi_control_read_error' to avoid deadlock.

The bug was found using EBA (https://github.com/models-team/eba), which reported
the following:

    Double lock
    first at drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:443
    second at drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:447
    In cs_hsi_read_on_control_complete defined at drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:438:
    (!) drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:443: spin_lock(& hi->lock);
    (?) drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:445: msg->status == 4 -> true
    (!) drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:447: cs_hsi_control_read_error(hi, msg);
        (!) drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:407: __cs_hsi_error_pre(hi, msg, "control read",
                       & hi->control_state);
            (!) drivers/hsi/clients/cmt_speech.c:382: spin_lock(& hi->lock);
