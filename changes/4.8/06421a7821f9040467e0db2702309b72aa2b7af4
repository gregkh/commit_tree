clk: sunxi-ng: nk: Make ccu_nk_find_best static

make C=2 reports:

  CHECK   drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu_nk.c
drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu_nk.c:17:6: warning: symbol 'ccu_nk_find_best' was
not declared. Should it be static?

ccu_nk_find_best is only used within ccu_nk.c. So make it static to get
rid of this warning.
