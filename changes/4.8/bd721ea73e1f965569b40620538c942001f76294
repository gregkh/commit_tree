treewide: replace obsolete _refok by __ref

There was only one use of __initdata_refok and __exit_refok

__init_refok was used 46 times against 82 for __ref.

Those definitions are obsolete since commit 312b1485fb50 ("Introduce new
section reference annotations tags: __ref, __refdata, __refconst")

This patch removes the following compatibility definitions and replaces
them treewide.

/* compatibility defines */
#define __init_refok     __ref
#define __initdata_refok __refdata
#define __exit_refok     __ref

I can also provide separate patches if necessary.
(One patch per tree and check in 1 month or 2 to remove old definitions)
