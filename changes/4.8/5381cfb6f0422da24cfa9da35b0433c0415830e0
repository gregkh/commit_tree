power: supply: max17042_battery: fix model download bug.

The device's model download function returns the model data as
an array of u32s, which is later compared to the reference
model data. However, since the latter is an array of u16s,
the comparison does not happen correctly, and model verification
fails. This in turn breaks the POR initialization sequence.
