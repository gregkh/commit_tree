drm/i915: Remove intel_limit_t typedef

The coding style documentation says the following about typedefs:

"In general, a pointer, or a struct that has elements that can
reasonably be directly accessed should _never_ be a typedef."

intel_limit_t falls in that category, so just use "struct intel_limit"
instead.
