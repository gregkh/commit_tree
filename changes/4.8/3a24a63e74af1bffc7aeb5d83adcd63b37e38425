batman-adv: move GW mode and selection class to private data structure

To reduce the field pollution in our main batadv_priv data structure
we've already created some substructures so that we could group fields
in a convenient manner.

However gw_mode and gw_sel_class are still part of the main object.

More both fields to the GW private substructure.
