perf record: Prepare reading from multiple evlists in record__mmap_read_all()

Following commits introduce new evlists to record. This patch adjusts
record__mmap_read_all() and record__mmap_read(): converting original
record__mmap_read_all() to record__mmap_read_evlist(), read from one
evlist; makes record__mmap_read() reading from specific evlist.
record__mmap_read_all() will be improved to read from multiple evlists.
