Btrfs: send, add missing error check for calls to path_loop()

The function path_loop() can return a negative integer, signaling an
error, 0 if there's no path loop and 1 if there's a path loop. We were
treating any non zero values as meaning that a path loop exists. Fix
this by explicitly checking for errors and gracefully return them to
user space.
