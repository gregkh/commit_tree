MIPS: KVM: Don't save/restore lo/hi for r6

MIPSr6 doesn't have lo/hi registers, so don't bother saving or
restoring them, and don't expose them to userland with the KVM ioctl
interface either.

In fact the lo/hi registers aren't callee saved in the MIPS ABIs anyway,
so there is no need to preserve the host lo/hi values at all when
transitioning to and from the guest (which happens via a function call).
