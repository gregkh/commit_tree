net: vrf: Minor refactoring for local address patches

Move the stripping of the ethernet header from is_ip_tx_frame into the
ipv4 and ipv6 outbound functions. If the packet is destined to a local
address the header is retained since the packet is sent back to netif_rx.

Collapse vrf_send_v4_prep into vrf_process_v4_outbound.
