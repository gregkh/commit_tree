KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Allow updates of LPI configuration table

The (system-wide) LPI configuration table is held in a table in
(guest) memory. To achieve reasonable performance, we cache this data
in our struct vgic_irq. If the guest updates the configuration data
(which consists of the enable bit and the priority value), it issues
an INV or INVALL command to allow us to update our information.
Provide functions that update that information for one LPI or all LPIs
mapped to a specific collection.
