Bluetooth: Rename HCI_BREDR into HCI_PRIMARY

The HCI_BREDR naming is confusing since it actually stands for Primary
Bluetooth Controller. Which is a term that has been used in the latest
standard. However from a legacy point of view there only really have
been Basic Rate (BR) and Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). Recent versions of
Bluetooth introduced Low Energy (LE) and made this terminology a little
bit confused since Dual Mode Controllers include BR/EDR and LE. To
simplify this the name HCI_PRIMARY stands for the Primary Controller
which can be a single mode or dual mode controller.
