crypto: sha-mb - Cleanup code to use || instead of |

 for condition comparison and cleanup multiline comment style

In sha*_ctx_mgr_submit, we currently use the | operator instead of ||
((ctx->partial_block_buffer_length) | (len < SHA1_BLOCK_SIZE))

Switching it to || and remove extraneous paranthesis to
adhere to coding style.

Also cleanup inconsistent multiline comment style.
