Bluetooth: btusb: add support for device 0489:e092

With current btusb.ko kernel module, Bluetooth pretends to be active
but there is no real activity.

I'm using an Acer Aspire VN7-791.

Output of lsusb:
Bus 003 Device 007: ID 0489:e092 Foxconn / Hon Hai

On my laptop, this device is actually used as a combo with wifi chipset
Atheros Qualcomm Killer N1525 Wireless-AC [168c:003e],

* Fix by adding a declaration in kernel sources drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c

        { USB_DEVICE(0x0489, 0xe092), .driver_info = BTUSB_QCA_ROME },

* Compiled extra module /lib/modules/4.4.0-22-generic/extra/btusb.ko

* Successfully tested against my phone (obex file transfer)
