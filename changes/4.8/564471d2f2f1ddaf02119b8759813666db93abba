xprtrdma: Create common scatterlist fields in rpcrdma_mw

Clean up: FMR is about to replace the rpcrdma_map_one code with
scatterlists. Move the scatterlist fields out of the FRWR-specific
union and into the generic part of rpcrdma_mw.

One minor change: -EIO is now returned if FRWR registration fails.
The RPC is terminated immediately, since the problem is likely due
to a software bug, thus retrying likely won't help.
