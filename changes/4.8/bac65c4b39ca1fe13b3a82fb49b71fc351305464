Revert "net: ethernet: bcmgenet: use phy_ethtool_{get|set}_link_ksettings"

This reverts commit 4386f5662e63 ("net: ethernet: bcmgenet: use
phy_ethtool_{get|set}_link_ksettings")

This patch is wrong, the function phy_ethtool_{get|set}_link_ksettings
don't check if the device is running, but the driver bcmgenet need this
check.

The function {get|set}_settings need to access the mdio bus, and this
bus may only be used when the device is running. Otherwise, the clock
is disable and a mdio access will fail.
