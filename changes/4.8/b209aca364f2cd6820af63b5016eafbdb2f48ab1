drm: Export drm_dev_init() for subclassing

In order to allow drivers to pack their privates and drm_device into one
struct (e.g. for subclassing), export the initialisation routines for
struct drm_device.

v2: Missed return ret. That error path had only one job to do!
v3: Cross-referencing drm_dev_init/drm_dev_alloc in kerneldoc, fix
missed error code for goto err_minors.
