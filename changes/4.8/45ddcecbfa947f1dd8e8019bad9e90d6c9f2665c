genirq: Use affinity hint in irqdesc allocation

Use the affinity hint in the irqdesc allocator. The hint is used to determine
the node for the allocation and to set the affinity of the interrupt.

If multiple interrupts are allocated (multi-MSI) then the allocator iterates
over the cpumask and for each set cpu it allocates on their node and sets the
initial affinity to that cpu.

If a single interrupt is allocated (MSI-X) then the allocator uses the first
cpu in the mask to compute the allocation node and uses the mask for the
initial affinity setting.

Interrupts set up this way are marked with the AFFINITY_MANAGED flag to
prevent userspace from messing with their affinity settings.
