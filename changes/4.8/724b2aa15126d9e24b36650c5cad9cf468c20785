net/mlx5e: TIRs management refactoring

The current refresh tirs self loopback mechanism, refreshes all the tirs
belonging to the same mlx5e instance to prevent self loopback by packets
sent over any ring of that instance. This mechanism relies on all the
tirs/tises of an instance to be created with the same transport domain
number (tdn).

Change the driver to refresh all the tirs created under the same tdn
regardless of which mlx5e netdev instance they belong to.

This behaviour is needed for introducing new mlx5e instances which serve
to represent SRIOV VFs. The representors and the PF share vport used for
E-Switch management, and we want to avoid NIC level HW loopback between
them, e.g when sending broadcast packets. To achieve that, both the
representors and the PF NIC will share the tdn.

This patch doesn't add any new functionality.
