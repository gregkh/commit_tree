xen: change the type of xen_vcpu_id to uint32_t

We pass xen_vcpu_id mapping information to hypercalls which require
uint32_t type so it would be cleaner to have it as uint32_t. The
initializer to -1 can be dropped as we always do the mapping before using
it and we never check the 'not set' value anyway.
