rxrpc: Calls displayed in /proc may in future lack a connection

Allocated rxrpc calls displayed in /proc/net/rxrpc_calls may in future be
on the proc list before they're connected or after they've been
disconnected - in which case they may not have a pointer to a connection
struct that can be used to get data from there.

Deal with this by using stuff from the call struct in preference where
possible and printing "no_connection" rather than a peer address if no
connection is assigned.

This change also has the added bonus that the service ID is now taken from
the call rather the connection which will allow per-call service upgrades
to be shown - something required for AuriStor server compatibility.
