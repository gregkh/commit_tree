drm: Refactor drop/set master code a bit

File open/set_maseter ioctl and file close/drop_master ioctl share the
same master handling code. Extract it.

Note that vmwgfx's master_set callback needs to know whether the
master is a new one or has been used already, so thread this through.
On the close/drop side a similar parameter existed, but wasnt used.
Drop it to simplify the flow.

v2: Try to make it not leak so much (Emil).

v3: Send out the right version ...
