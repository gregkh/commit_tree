net/ncsi: Resource management

NCSI spec (DSP0222) defines several objects: package, channel, mode,
filter, version and statistics etc. This introduces the data structs
to represent those objects and implement functions to manage them.
Also, this introduces CONFIG_NET_NCSI for the newly implemented NCSI
stack.

   * The user (e.g. netdev driver) dereference NCSI device by
     "struct ncsi_dev", which is embedded to "struct ncsi_dev_priv".
     The later one is used by NCSI stack internally.
   * Every NCSI device can have multiple packages simultaneously, up
     to 8 packages. It's represented by "struct ncsi_package" and
     identified by 3-bits ID.
   * Every NCSI package can have multiple channels, up to 32. It's
     represented by "struct ncsi_channel" and identified by 5-bits ID.
   * Every NCSI channel has version, statistics, various modes and
     filters. They are represented by "struct ncsi_channel_version",
     "struct ncsi_channel_stats", "struct ncsi_channel_mode" and
     "struct ncsi_channel_filter" separately.
   * Apart from AEN (Asynchronous Event Notification), the NCSI stack
     works in terms of command and response. This introduces "struct
     ncsi_req" to represent a complete NCSI transaction made of NCSI
     request and response.
