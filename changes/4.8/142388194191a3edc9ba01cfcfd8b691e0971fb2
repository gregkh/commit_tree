btrfs: do not background blkdev_put()

At the end of unmount/dev-delete, if the device exclusive open is not
actually closed, then there might be a race with another program in
the userland who is trying to open the device in exclusive mode and
it may fail for eg:
      unmount /btrfs; fsck /dev/x
      btrfs dev del /dev/x /btrfs; fsck /dev/x
so here background blkdev_put() is not a choice
