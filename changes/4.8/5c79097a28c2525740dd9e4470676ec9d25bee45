libata-scsi: reject WRITE SAME (16) with n_block that exceeds limit

Currently if a WRITE SAME (16) command is issued to the SATL with
"number of blocks" that is larger than the "Maximum write same length"
(which is the maximum number of blocks per TRIM command allowed in
libata, currently 65535 * 512 / 8 blocks), the SATL will accept the
command and translate it to a TRIM command with the upper limit.

However, according to SBC (as of sbc4r11.pdf), the "device server"
should terminate the command with "Invalid field in CDB" in that case.
