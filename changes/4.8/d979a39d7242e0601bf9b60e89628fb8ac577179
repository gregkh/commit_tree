cgroup: duplicate cgroup reference when cloning sockets

When a socket is cloned, the associated sock_cgroup_data is duplicated
but not its reference on the cgroup.  As a result, the cgroup reference
count will underflow when both sockets are destroyed later on.

Fixes: bd1060a1d671 ("sock, cgroup: add sock->sk_cgroup")
