pcmcia: sa11xx_base: fix reporting of timing information

Fix the reporting of the currently programmed timing information.  These
entries have been showing zero due to the clock rate being a factor of
1000 too big.  With this change, we go from:

I/O      : 165 (0)
attribute: 300 (0)
common   : 300 (0)

to:

I/O      : 165 (172)
attribute: 300 (316)
common   : 300 (316)
