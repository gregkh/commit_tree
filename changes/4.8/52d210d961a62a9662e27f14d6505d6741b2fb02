pstore: drop file opened reference count

In ee1d267423a1 ("pstore: add pstore unregister") I added:
	.owner = THIS_MODULE,
in both pstore_fs_type and pstore_file_operations to increase a reference
count when pstore filesystem is mounted and pstore file is opened.

But, it's repetitive. There is no need to increase the opened reference
count. We only need to increase the mounted reference count. When a file
is opened, the filesystem can't be unmounted. Hence the pstore module
can't be unloaded either.

So I drop the opened reference count in this patch.
