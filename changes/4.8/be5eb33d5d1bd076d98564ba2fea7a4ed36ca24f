clocksource/drivers/asm9260: Convert init function to return error

The init functions do not return any error. They behave as the following:

 - panic, thus leading to a kernel crash while another timer may work and
   make the system boot up correctly

 or

 - print an error and let the caller unaware if the state of the system

Change that by converting the init functions to return an error conforming
to the CLOCKSOURCE_OF_RET prototype.

Proper error handling (rollback, errno value) will be changed later case
by case, thus this change just return back an error or success in the init
function.
