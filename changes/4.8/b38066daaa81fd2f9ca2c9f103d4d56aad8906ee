cxgb4vf: Synchronize access to mailbox

The issue comes when there are multiple threads attempting to use the
mailbox facility at the same time. The issue is the for the Virtual
Function Driver, the only way to get the Virtual Interface statistics
is to issue mailbox commands to ask the firmware for the VI Stats.
And, because the VI Stats command can only retrieve a smallish number of
stats per mailbox command, we have to issue three mailbox commands in quick
succession. When ethtool or netstat command to get interface stats and
interface up/down is run in a loop for every 0.1 sec, we observed
mailbox collisions. And out of the two commands one would fail with
the present code, since we don't queue the second command.

To overcome the above issue, added a queue to access the mailbox.
Whenever a mailbox command is issued add it to the queue. If its at the
head issue the mailbox command, else wait for the existing command to
complete. Usually command takes less than a milli-second to complete.
Also timeout from the loop, if the command under execution takes
long time to run.

In reality, the number of mailbox access collisions is going to be very
rare since no one runs such abusive script.
