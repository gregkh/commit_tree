PCI/ACPI: Add generic MCFG table handling

On ACPI systems that support memory-mapped config space access, i.e., ECAM,
the PCI Firmware Specification says the OS can learn where the ECAM space
is from either:

  - the static MCFG table (for non-hotpluggable bridges), or
  - the _CBA method (for hotpluggable bridges)

The current MCFG table handling code cannot be easily generalized owing to
x86-specific quirks, which makes it hard to reuse on other architectures.

Implement generic MCFG handling from scratch, including:

  - Simple MCFG table parsing (via pci_mmcfg_late_init() as in current x86)
  - MCFG region lookup for a (domain, bus_start, bus_end) tuple
