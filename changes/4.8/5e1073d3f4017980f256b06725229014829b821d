staging: unisys: visorhba: simplify and enhance debugfs interface

debugfs info for each visorhba device is now presented by a file named of
the following form within the debugfs tree:

    visorhba/vbus<x>:dev<y>/info

where <x> is the vbus number, and <y> is the relative device number.

Also, the debugfs presentation function was converted to use the seq_file
interface, so that it could access the device context without resorting to
a global array.  This also simplified the function.
