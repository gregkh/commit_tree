qed: Move doorbell calculation from VF to PF

Today, the VF is aware of its queues context-ids, and calculates the
doorbell address when opening its queues on its own.
The configuration of doorbells in HW can sometime in the future be changed
by the PF [hw has several configurable features that might affect doorbell
addresses, e.g., dpm support], this would break compatibility with older
VFs as their calculated doorbell addresses would be incorrect for such a
configuration.

In order to avoid such a backward compatibility failure, let the PF make
the calculation of the doorbell offset based on the context-id, and pass
that to the VF.
