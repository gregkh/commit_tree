arm64: add conditional instruction simulation support

Cease using the arm32 arm_check_condition() function and replace it with
a local version for use in deprecated instruction support on arm64. Also
make the function table used by this available for future use by kprobes
and/or uprobes.

This function is derived from code written by Sandeepa Prabhu.
