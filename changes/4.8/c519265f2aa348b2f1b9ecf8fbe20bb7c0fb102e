KVM: x86: add a flag to disable KVM x2apic broadcast quirk

Add KVM_X2APIC_API_DISABLE_BROADCAST_QUIRK as a feature flag to
KVM_CAP_X2APIC_API.

The quirk made KVM interpret 0xff as a broadcast even in x2APIC mode.
The enableable capability is needed in order to support standard x2APIC and
remain backward compatible.
