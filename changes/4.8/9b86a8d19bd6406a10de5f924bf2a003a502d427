cxgb4/cxgb4vf: Allocate more queues for 25G and 100G adapter

We were missing check for 25G and 100G while checking port speed,
which lead to less number of queues getting allocated for 25G & 100G
adapters and leading to low throughput. Adding the missing check for
both NIC and vNIC driver.

Also fixes port advertisement for 25G and 100G in ethtool output.
