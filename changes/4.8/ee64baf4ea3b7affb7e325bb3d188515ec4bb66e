s390/uaccess: use __builtin_expect for get_user/put_user

We always expect that get_user and put_user return with zero. Give the
compiler a hint so it can slightly optimize the code and avoid
branches.
This is the same what x86 got with commit a76cf66e948a ("x86/uaccess:
Tell the compiler that uaccess is unlikely to fault").
