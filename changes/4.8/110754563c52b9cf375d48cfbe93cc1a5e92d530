Documentation: phy: Let the rockchip eMMC PHY get an exported card clock

As of an earlier change in this series ("Documentation: mmc:
sdhci-of-arasan: Add ability to export card clock") the SDHCI driver
used on Rockchip SoCs can now expose its clock.  Let's now specify that
the PHY can use it.

Letting the PHY get access to this clock means it can adjust
phyctrl_frqsel field appropriately.  Although the Rockchip PHY appears
slightly different than the reference Arasan one, you can see that the
Arasan datasheet [1] had it defined as:
  Select the frequency range of DLL operation:
  3b'000 => 200MHz to 170 MHz
  3b'001 => 170MHz to 140 MHz
  3b'010 => 140MHz to 110 MHz
  3b'011 => 110MHz to 80MHz
  3b'100 => 80MHz to 50 MHz
  3b'101 => 275Mhz to 250MHz
  3b'110 => 250MHz to 225MHz
  3b'111 => 225MHz to 200MHz

On the Rockchip version of the PHY we have less granularity but the idea
is the same.
