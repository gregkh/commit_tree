clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Force per-CPU interrupt to be level-triggered

The ARM architected timer produces level-triggered interrupts (this
is mandated by the architecture). Unfortunately, a number of
device-trees get this wrong, and expose an edge-triggered interrupt.

Until now, this wasn't too much an issue, as the programming of the
trigger would fail (the corresponding PPI cannot be reconfigured),
and the kernel would be happy with this. But we're about to change
this, and trust DT a lot if the driver doesn't provide its own
trigger information. In that context, the timer breaks badly.

While we do need to fix the DTs, there is also some userspace out
there (kvmtool) that generates the same kind of broken DT on the
fly, and that will completely break with newer kernels.

As a safety measure, and to keep buggy software alive as well as
buying us some time to fix DTs all over the place, let's check
what trigger configuration has been given us by the firmware.
If this is not a level configuration, then we know that the
DT/ACPI configuration is bust, and we pick some defaults which
won't be worse than the existing setup.
