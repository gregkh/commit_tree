iio: adc: at91: unbreak channel adc channel 3

The driver always assumes that an input device has been created when
reading channel 3. This causes a kernel panic when dereferencing
st->ts_input.

The change was introduced in
commit 84882b060301 ("iio: adc: at91_adc: Add support for touchscreens
without TSMR"). Earlier versions only entered that part of the if-else
statement if only the following flags are set:

AT91_ADC_IER_XRDY | AT91_ADC_IER_YRDY | AT91_ADC_IER_PRDY
