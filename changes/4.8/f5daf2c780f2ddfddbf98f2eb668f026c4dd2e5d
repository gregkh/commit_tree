Btrfs: fix BUG_ON in btrfs_submit_compressed_write

This is similar to btrfs_submit_compressed_read(), if we fail after
bio is allocated, then we can use bio_endio() and errors are saved
 in bio->bi_error.  But please note that we don't return errors to
its caller because the caller assumes it won't call endio to cleanup
on error.
