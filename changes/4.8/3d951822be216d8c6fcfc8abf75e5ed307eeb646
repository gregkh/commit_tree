ixgbe: Re-enable ability to toggle VLAN filtering

Back when I submitted the GSO code I messed up and dropped the support for
disabling the VLAN tag filtering via the feature bit.  This patch
re-enables the use of the NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER to enable/disable the
VLAN filtering independent of toggling promiscuous mode.
