dwc_eth_qos: fix interrupt enable race

We currently enable interrupts before we enable NAPI. If an RX interrupt
hits before we enabled NAPI then the NAPI callback is never called and
we leave the hardware with RX interrupts disabled, which of course leads
us to never handling received packets.  Fix this by moving the interrupt
enable to after we've enable NAPI and the reclaim tasklet.
