x86: Don't use module.h just for AUTHOR / LICENSE tags

The Kconfig controlling compilation of these files are:

 arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:config DEBUG_RODATA_TEST
 arch/x86/Kconfig.debug: bool "Testcase for the marking rodata read-only"

 arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:config X86_PTDUMP_CORE
 arch/x86/Kconfig.debug: def_bool n

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
