pinctrl: baytrail: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config PINCTRL_BAYTRAIL
        bool "Intel Baytrail GPIO pin control"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_init() was already not in use in this driver, we don't
have any concerns with init ordering changes here.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
