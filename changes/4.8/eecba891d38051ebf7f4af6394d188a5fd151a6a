btrfs: flush_space: treat return value of do_chunk_alloc properly

do_chunk_alloc returns 1 when it succeeds to allocate a new chunk.
But flush_space will not convert this to 0, and will also return 1.
As a result, reserve_metadata_bytes will think that flush_space failed,
and may potentially return this value "1" to the caller (depends how
reserve_metadata_bytes was called). The caller will also treat this as an error.
For example, btrfs_block_rsv_refill does:

int ret = -ENOSPC;
...
ret = reserve_metadata_bytes(root, block_rsv, num_bytes, flush);
if (!ret) {
        block_rsv_add_bytes(block_rsv, num_bytes, 0);
        return 0;
}

return ret;

So it will return -ENOSPC.
