pinctrl: nsp-gpio: fix non-static functions

Fixup warnings from functions that are not exported and
therefore should be marked static. Fixes:

drivers/pinctrl/bcm/pinctrl-nsp-gpio.c:461:5:
  warning: symbol 'nsp_pin_config_group_get' was not declared.
  Should it be static?
drivers/pinctrl/bcm/pinctrl-nsp-gpio.c:467:5:
  warning: symbol 'nsp_pin_config_group_set' was not declared.
  Should it be static?
