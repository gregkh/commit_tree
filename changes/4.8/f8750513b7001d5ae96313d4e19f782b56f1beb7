powerpc/kvm: Clarify __user annotations

kvmppc_h_put_tce_indirect labels a u64 pointer as __user. It also
labelled the u64 where get_user puts the result as __user. This isn't
a pointer and so doesn't need to be labelled __user.

Split the u64 value definition onto a new line to make it clear that
it doesn't get the annotation.
