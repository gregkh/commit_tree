bpf: introduce bpf_get_current_task() helper

over time there were multiple requests to access different data
structures and fields of task_struct current, so finally add
the helper to access 'current' as-is. Tracing bpf programs will do
the rest of walking the pointers via bpf_probe_read().
Note that current can be null and bpf program has to deal it with,
but even dumb passing null into bpf_probe_read() is still safe.
