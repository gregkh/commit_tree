extable.h: add stddef.h so "NULL" definition is not implicit

While not an issue now, eventually we will have independent users of
the extable.h file and we will stop sourcing it via module.h header.

In testing that pending work, with very sparse builds, characteristic
of an "allnoconfig" on various architectures, we can sometimes hit an
instance where the very basic standard definitions aren't present,
resulting in:

 include/linux/extable.h:26:9: error: 'NULL' undeclared (first use in this function)

To be clear, this isn't a regression, since currently extable.h is
only used by module.h -- however, we will need this addition present
before we start migrating exception table users off module.h and onto
extable.h during the next release cycle.
