cxl: Move cxl_afu_get / cxl_afu_put to base

The Mellanox CX4 uses a model where the AFU is one physical function of
the device, and is used by other peer physical functions of the same
device. This will require those other devices to grab a reference on the
AFU when they are initialised to make sure that it does not go away
during their lifetime.

Move the AFU refcount functions to base.c so they can be called from
the PHB code.
