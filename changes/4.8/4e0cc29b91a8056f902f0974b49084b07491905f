xfs: move deferred operations into a separate file

All the code around struct xfs_bmap_free basically implements a
deferred operation framework through which we can roll transactions
(to unlock buffers and avoid violating lock order rules) while
managing all the necessary log redo items.  Previously we only used
this code to free extents after some sort of mapping operation, but
with the advent of rmap and reflink, we suddenly need to do more than
that.

With that in mind, xfs_bmap_free really becomes a deferred ops control
structure.  Rename the structure and move the deferred ops into their
own file to avoid further bloating of the bmap code.
