xhci: properly prepare zero packet TD after normal bulk TD.

If a zero-length packet is needed after a bulk transfer, then an
additional zero length TD was prepared before enqueueing the bulk transfer
This set up the zero packet TD structure with incorrect td->start_seg
and td->first_trb pointers.

Prepare the zero packet TD after the data bulk TD is enqueued instead.
It sets these pointers correctly.

This change also simplifies unnecessary complexity related to keeping
track of the last trb when enqueuing trbs.
