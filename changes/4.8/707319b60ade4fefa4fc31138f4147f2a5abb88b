regulator: da9053/52: Fix incorrectly stated minimum and maximum voltage limits

This fix alters the minimum and maximum BUCK voltage limits for DA9052 and
DA9053. It does so for the following cases:

DA9052
- BUCK3 (MEM)
   min: 0.925V -> 0.950V
   max: 2.500V -> 2.525V

DA9053
- BUCK3 (MEM)
   min: 0.925V -> 0.950V
   max: 2.500V -> 2.525V
- BUCK4 (PERI)
   min: 0.925V -> 0.950V
   max: 2.500V -> 2.525V

The voltage range remains the same, but the limits are shifted by +0.025V.

This change is provided on DA9052:MEM, DA9053:MEM and DA9053:PERI
and is a voltage difference of 0.025V, compared to those measured before
this fix is applied. The patch has the effect of decreasing *all* measured
voltages on those BUCKs when compared against the previously measured
values for the same software voltage request.

For example, with this fix applied for DA9052:MEM, DA9053:MEM and
DA9053:PERI, the following is true.

Because the previous software defined slot 0 as being 0.925V, if a request
for 0.950V was previously sent, the slot 1 voltage would have been used.
This would have corresponded to an actual measured voltage of 0.975V. But,
with this patch fix, and with slot 0 properly aligned to 0.950V, if a
voltage of 0.950V is requested by software, a measured value of 0.950V will
be provided.
