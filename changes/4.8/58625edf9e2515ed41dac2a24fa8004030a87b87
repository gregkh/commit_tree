virtio: fix memory leak in virtqueue_add()

When using the indirect buffers feature, 'desc' is allocated in
virtqueue_add() but isn't freed before leaving on a ring full error,
causing a memory leak.

For example, it seems rather clear that this can trigger
with virtio net if mergeable buffers are not used.
