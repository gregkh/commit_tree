drm/i915: Stop setting wraparound seqno on initialisation

We have testcases to ensure that seqno wraparound works fine, so we can
forgo forcing everyone to encounter seqno wraparound during early
uptime. seqno wraparound incurs a full GPU stall so not forcing it
will eliminate one jitter from the early system. Using the testcases, we
have very deterministic testing which given how difficult it would be to
debug an issue (GPU hang) stemming from a wraparound using pure
postmortem analysis I see no value in forcing a wrap during boot.

Advancing the global next_seqno after a GPU reset is equally pointless.
