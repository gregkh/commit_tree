mm, oom: tighten task_will_free_mem() locking

"mm, oom: fortify task_will_free_mem" has dropped task_lock around
task_will_free_mem in oom_kill_process bacause it assumed that a
potential race when the selected task exits will not be a problem as the
oom_reaper will call exit_oom_victim.

Tetsuo was objecting that nommu doesn't have oom_reaper so the race
would be still possible.  The code would be racy and lockup prone
theoretically in other aspects without the oom reaper anyway so I didn't
considered this a big deal.  But it seems that further changes I am
planning in this area will benefit from stable task->mm in this path as
well.  So let's drop find_lock_task_mm from task_will_free_mem and call
it from under task_lock as we did previously.  Just pull the task->mm !=
NULL check inside the function.
