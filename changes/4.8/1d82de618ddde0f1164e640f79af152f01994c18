mm, vmscan: make kswapd reclaim in terms of nodes

Patch "mm: vmscan: Begin reclaiming pages on a per-node basis" started
thinking of reclaim in terms of nodes but kswapd is still zone-centric.
This patch gets rid of many of the node-based versus zone-based
decisions.

o A node is considered balanced when any eligible lower zone is balanced.
  This eliminates one class of age-inversion problem because we avoid
  reclaiming a newer page just because it's in the wrong zone
o pgdat_balanced disappears because we now only care about one zone being
  balanced.
o Some anomalies related to writeback and congestion tracking being based on
  zones disappear.
o kswapd no longer has to take care to reclaim zones in the reverse order
  that the page allocator uses.
o Most importantly of all, reclaim from node 0 with multiple zones will
  have similar aging and reclaiming characteristics as every
  other node.
