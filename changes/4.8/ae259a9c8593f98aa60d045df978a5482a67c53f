fs: introduce iomap infrastructure

Add infrastructure for multipage buffered writes.  This is implemented
using an main iterator that applies an actor function to a range that
can be written.

This infrastucture is used to implement a buffered write helper, one
to zero file ranges and one to implement the ->page_mkwrite VM
operations.  All of them borrow a fair amount of code from fs/buffers.
for now by using an internal version of __block_write_begin that
gets passed an iomap and builds the corresponding buffer head.

The file system is gets a set of paired ->iomap_begin and ->iomap_end
calls which allow it to map/reserve a range and get a notification
once the write code is finished with it.

Based on earlier code from Dave Chinner.
