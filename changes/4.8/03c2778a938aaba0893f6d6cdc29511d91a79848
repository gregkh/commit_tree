ipv6: release dst in ping_v6_sendmsg

Neither the failure or success paths of ping_v6_sendmsg release
the dst it acquires.  This leads to a flood of warnings from
"net/core/dst.c:288 dst_release" on older kernels that
don't have 8bf4ada2e21378816b28205427ee6b0e1ca4c5f1 backported.

That patch optimistically hoped this had been fixed post 3.10, but
it seems at least one case wasn't, where I've seen this triggered
a lot from machines doing unprivileged icmp sockets.
