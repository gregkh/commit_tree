ratelimit: extend to print suppressed messages on release

Extend the ratelimiting facility to print the amount of suppressed lines
when it is being released.

This use case is aimed at short-termed, burst-like users for which we
want to output the suppressed lines stats only once, after it has been
disposed of.  For an example, see /dev/kmsg usage in a follow-on patch.

Also, change the printk() line we issue on release to not use
"callbacks" as it is misleading: we're not suppressing callbacks but
printk() calls.

This has been separated from a previous patch by Linus.
