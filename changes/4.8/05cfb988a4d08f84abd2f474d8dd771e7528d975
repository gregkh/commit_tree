soc/tegra: pmc: Initialise resets associated with a power partition

When registering the Tegra power partitions with the generic PM domain
framework, the current state of the each partition is checked and used
as the default state for the partition. However, the state of each reset
associated with the partition is not initialised and so it is possible
that the state of the resets are not in the expected state. For example,
if a partition is on, then the resets should be de-asserted and if the
partition is off, the resets should be asserted.

There have been cases where the bootloader has powered on a partition
and only de-asserted some of the resets to some of the devices in the
partition. This can cause accesses to these devices to hang the system
when the kernel boots and attempts to probe these devices.

Ideally, the driver for the device should ensure the reset has been
de-asserted when probing, but the resets cannot be shared between the
PMC driver (that needs to de-assert/assert the reset when turning the
partition on or off) and another driver because we cannot ensure the
reset is in the correct state.

To ensure the resets are in the correct state, when using the generic
PM domain framework, put each reset associated with the partition in
the correct state (based upon the partition's current state) when
obtaining the resets for a partition.
