ACPI / lpat: make it explicitly non-modular

The Makefile for building this is "acpi-y" and so it is not built
as a module.  Hence including module.h and everything that comes
with it just for the no-op MODULE_LICENSE is rather heavy handed.

The license info is found at the top of the file, so we just remove
the MODULE_LICENSE and the include of module.h

We add an include of export.h since the file exports some symbols.
