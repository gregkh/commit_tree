s390: have unique symbol for __switch_to address

After linking there are several symbols for the same address that the
__switch_to symbol points to. E.g.:

000000000089b9c0 T __kprobes_text_start
000000000089b9c0 T __lock_text_end
000000000089b9c0 T __lock_text_start
000000000089b9c0 T __sched_text_end
000000000089b9c0 T __switch_to

When disassembling with "objdump -d" this results in a missing
__switch_to function. It would be named __kprobes_text_start
instead. To unconfuse objdump add a nop in front of the kprobes text
section. That way __switch_to appears again.

Obviously this solution is sort of a hack, since it also depends on
link order if this works or not. However it is the best I can come up
with for now.
