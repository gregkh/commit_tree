rxrpc: Turn connection #defines into enums and put outside struct def

Turn the connection event and state #define lists into enums and move
outside of the struct definition.

Whilst we're at it, change _SERVER to _SERVICE in those identifiers and add
EV_ into the event name to distinguish them from flags and states.

Also add a symbol indicating the number of states and use that in the state
text array.
