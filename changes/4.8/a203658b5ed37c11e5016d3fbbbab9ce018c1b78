powerpc/opal: Wake up kopald polling thread before waiting for events

On some environments (prototype machines, some simulators, etc...)
there is no functional interrupt source to signal completion, so
we rely on the fairly slow OPAL heartbeat.

In a number of cases, the calls complete very quickly or even
immediately. We've observed that it helps a lot to wakeup the OPAL
heartbeat thread before waiting for event in those cases, it will
call OPAL immediately to collect completions for anything that
finished fast enough.
