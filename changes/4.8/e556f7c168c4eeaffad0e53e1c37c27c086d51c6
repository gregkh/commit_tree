drm/i915/guc: fix GuC loading/submission check

The last stage of the GuC loader also sanitises the GuC submission
settings, so should be called unconditionally (even on platforms
without a GuC) to ensure consistent settings; in particular, this
prevents any attempt to use GuC submission on GuCless platforms!

Also fix error path handling and clarify DRM_INFO fallback message.
