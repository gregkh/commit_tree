drm/i915: Allow userspace to request no-error-capture upon GPU hangs

igt likes to inject GPU hangs into its command streams. However, as we
expect these hangs, we don't actually want them recorded in the dmesg
output or stored in the i915_error_state (usually). To accommodate this
allow userspace to set a flag on the context that any hang emanating
from that context will not be recorded. We still do the error capture
(otherwise how do we find the guilty context and know its intent?) as
part of the reason for random GPU hang injection is to exercise the race
conditions between the error capture and normal execution.

v2: Split out the request->ringbuf error capture changes.
v3: Move the flag defines next to the intel_context->flags definition
