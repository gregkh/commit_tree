clk: fixed-factor: Allow for a few clocks to change the parent rate

The only way for a fixed factor clock to change its rate would be to change
its parent rate.

Since passing blindly CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT might break a lot of platforms
that were relying on the fact that the parent rate wouldn't change,
introduce a compatible-based whitelist that will allow clocks to opt-in
that flag.
