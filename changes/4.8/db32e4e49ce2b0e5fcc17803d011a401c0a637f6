ip6_gre: fix flowi6_proto value in ip6gre_xmit_other()

Similar to commit 3be07244b733 ("ip6_gre: fix flowi6_proto value in
xmit path"), set flowi6_proto to IPPROTO_GRE for output route lookup.

Up until now, ip6gre_xmit_other() has set flowi6_proto to a bogus value.
This affected output route lookup for packets sent on an ip6gretap device
in cases where routing was dependent on the value of flowi6_proto.

Since the correct proto is already set in the tunnel flowi6 template via
commit 252f3f5a1189 ("ip6_gre: Set flowi6_proto as IPPROTO_GRE in xmit
path."), simply delete the line setting the incorrect flowi6_proto value.
