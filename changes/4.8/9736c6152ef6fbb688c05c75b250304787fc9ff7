MIPS: smp-cps: Allow booting of CPU other than VP0 within a core

The boot_core function was hardcoded to always start VP0 when starting
a core via the CPC. When hotplugging a CPU this may not be the desired
behaviour.

Make boot_core receive the VP ID to start running on the core, such that
alternate VPs can be started via CPU hotplug.
Also ensure that all other VPs within the core are stopped before
bringing the core out of reset so that only the desired VP starts.
