ARM: 8591/1: mm: use fully constructed struct pages for EFI pgd allocations

The late_alloc() PTE allocation function used by create_mapping_late()
does not call pgtable_page_ctor() on PTE pages it allocates, leaving
the per-page spinlock uninitialized.

Since generic page table manipulation code may assume that translation
table pages that are not owned by init_mm are covered by fully
constructed struct pages, the following crash may occur with the new
UEFI memory attributes table code.

The crash is due to the fact that the UEFI page tables are not owned by
init_mm, but are not covered by fully constructed struct pages.

Given that the UEFI subsystem is currently the only user of
create_mapping_late(), add an unconditional call to pgtable_page_ctor() to
late_alloc().
