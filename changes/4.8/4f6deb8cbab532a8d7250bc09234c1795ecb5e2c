sparc: Don't leak context bits into thread->fault_address

On pre-Niagara systems, we fetch the fault address on data TLB
exceptions from the TLB_TAG_ACCESS register.  But this register also
contains the context ID assosciated with the fault in the low 13 bits
of the register value.

This propagates into current_thread_info()->fault_address and can
cause trouble later on.

So clear the low 13-bits out of the TLB_TAG_ACCESS value in the cases
where it matters.
