f2fs: avoid data race between FI_DIRTY_INODE flag and update_inode

FI_DIRTY_INODE flag is not covered by inode page lock, so it can be unset
at any time like below.

Thread #1                        Thread #2
- lock_page(ipage)
- update i_fields
                                 - update i_size/i_blocks/and so on
				 - set FI_DIRTY_INODE
- reset FI_DIRTY_INODE
- set_page_dirty(ipage)

In this case, we can lose the latest i_field information.
