x86/fpu: Do not BUG_ON() in early FPU code

I don't think it is really possible to have a system where CPUID
enumerates support for XSAVE but that it does not have FP/SSE
(they are "legacy" features and always present).

But, I did manage to hit this case in qemu when I enabled its
somewhat shaky XSAVE support.  The bummer is that the FPU is set
up before we parse the command-line or have *any* console support
including earlyprintk.  That turned what should have been an easy
thing to debug in to a bit more of an odyssey.

So a BUG() here is worthless.  All it does it guarantee that
if/when we hit this case we have an empty console.  So, remove
the BUG() and try to limp along by disabling XSAVE and trying to
continue.  Add a comment on why we are doing this, and also add
a common "out_disable" path for leaving fpu__init_system_xstate().
