ath10k: fix 10.4 extended peer stats update

10.4 'extended peer stats' will be not be appended with normal peer stats
data and they shall be coming in separate chunks. Fix this by maintaining
a separate linked list 'extender peer stats' for 10.4 and update
rx_duration for per station statistics. Also parse through beacon filter
(if enabled), to make sure we parse the extended peer stats properly.
This issue was exposed when more than one client is connected and
extended peer stats for 10.4 is enabled

The order for the stats is as below
S - standard peer stats, E- extended peer stats, B - beacon filter stats

{S1, S2, S3..} -> {B1, B2, B3..}(if available) -> {E1, E2, E3..}
