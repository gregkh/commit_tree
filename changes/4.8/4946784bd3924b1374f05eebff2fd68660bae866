ubi: Make volume resize power cut aware

When the volume resize operation shrinks a volume,
LEBs will be unmapped. Since unmapping will not erase these
LEBs immediately we have to wait for that operation to finish.
Otherwise in case of a power cut right after writing the new
volume table the UBI attach process can find more LEBs than the
volume table knows. This will render the UBI image unattachable.

Fix this issue by waiting for erase to complete and write the new
volume table afterward.
