net: ipv6: Address selection needs to consider L3 domains

IPv6 version of 3f2fb9a834cb ("net: l3mdev: address selection should only
consider devices in L3 domain") and the follow up commit, a17b693cdd876
("net: l3mdev: prefer VRF master for source address selection").

That is, if outbound device is given then the address preference order
is an address from that device, an address from the master device if it
is enslaved, and then an address from a device in the same L3 domain.
