Documentation/module-signing.txt: Note need for version info if reusing a key

Signing a module should only make it trusted by the specific kernel it
was built for, not anything else.  If a module signing key is used for
multiple ABI-incompatible kernels, the modules need to include enough
version information to distinguish them.
