bcache: pr_err: more meaningful error message when nr_stripes is invalid

The original error was thought to be corruption, but was actually caused by:
	make-bcache --data-offset N
where N was in bytes and should have been in sectors.  While userspace
tools should be updated to check --data-offset beyond end of volume,
hopefully this will help others that might not have noticed the units.
