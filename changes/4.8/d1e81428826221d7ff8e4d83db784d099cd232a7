ASoC: core: Clean up DAPM before the card debugfs

Both the card and DAPM cleanups recursively delete their debugfs
directories.  Since the DAPM debugfs subdirectory for the card is
located within the card debugfs this means we end up trying to double
free the DAPM subdirectory.  Reorder the cleanup to free the card
debugfs after we've cleaned up DAPM and it has deleted its own
subdirectory.
