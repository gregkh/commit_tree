ARM: 8612/1: LPAE: initialize cache policy correctly

The cachepolicy variable gets initialized using a masked pmd
value. So far, the pmd has been masked with flags valid for the
2-page table format, but the 3-page table format requires a
different mask. On LPAE, this lead to a wrong assumption of what
initial cache policy has been used. Later a check forces the
cache policy to writealloc and prints the following warning:
Forcing write-allocate cache policy for SMP

This patch introduces a new definition PMD_SECT_CACHE_MASK for
both page table formats which masks in all cache flags in both
cases.
