spi: img-spfi: Remove spi_master_put in img_spfi_remove()

The call to spi_master_put() in img_spfi_remove() is redundant since
the master is registered using devm_spi_register_master() and no
reference hold by using spi_master_get() in img_spfi_remove().

This is detected by Coccinelle semantic patch.
