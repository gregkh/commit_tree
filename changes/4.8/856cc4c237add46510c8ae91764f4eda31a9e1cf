IB/hfi1: Add the capability for reserved operations

This fix allows for support of in-kernel reserved operations
without impacting the ULP user.

The low level driver can register a non-zero value which
will be transparently added to the send queue size and hidden
from the ULP in every respect.

ULP post sends will never see a full queue due to a reserved
post send and reserved operations will never exceed that
registered value.

The s_avail will continue to track the ULP swqe availability
and the difference between the reserved value and the reserved
in use will track reserved availabity.
