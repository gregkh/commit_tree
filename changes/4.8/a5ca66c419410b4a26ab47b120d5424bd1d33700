drbd: Introduce new disk config option rs-discard-granularity

As long as the value is 0 the feature is disabled. With setting
it to a positive value, DRBD limits and aligns its resync requests
to the rs-discard-granularity setting. If the sync source detects
all zeros in such a block, the resync target discards the range
on disk.
