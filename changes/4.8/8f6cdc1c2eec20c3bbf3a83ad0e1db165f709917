KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Move redistributor kvm_io_devices

Logically a GICv3 redistributor is assigned to a (v)CPU, so we should
aim to keep redistributor related variables out of our struct vgic_dist.

Let's start by replacing the redistributor related kvm_io_device array
with two members in our existing struct vgic_cpu, which are naturally
per-VCPU and thus don't require any allocation / freeing.
So apart from the better fit with the redistributor design this saves
some code as well.
