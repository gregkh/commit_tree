serial: m32r_sio: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/tty/serial/Kconfig:config SERIAL_M32R_SIO
drivers/tty/serial/Kconfig:     bool "M32R SIO I/F"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
