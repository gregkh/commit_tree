ASoC fix up SND_SOC_WM8985 dependency

I just added an I2C dependency to the wm8985 driver to work around
a build failure, but it turns out that was premature: we actually
need to depend on SND_SOC_I2C_AND_SPI, as the driver can work with either
of the two, and we only need to prevent a configuration that has
I2C=m and SND_SOC_WM8985=y.
