mm: introduce fault_env

The idea borrowed from Peter's patch from patchset on speculative page
faults[1]:

Instead of passing around the endless list of function arguments,
replace the lot with a single structure so we can change context without
endless function signature changes.

The changes are mostly mechanical with exception of faultaround code:
filemap_map_pages() got reworked a bit.

This patch is preparation for the next one.
