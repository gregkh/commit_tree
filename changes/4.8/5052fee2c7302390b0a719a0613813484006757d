drbd: finish resync on sync source only by notification from sync target

If the replication link breaks exactly during "resync finished" detection,
finishing too early on the sync source could again lead to UUIDs rotated
too fast, and potentially a spurious full resync on next handshake.

Always wait for explicit resync finished state change notification from
the sync target.
