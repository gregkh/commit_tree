IB/rdmvat: Fix double vfree() in rvt_create_qp() error path

The unwind logic for creating a user QP has a double vfree
of the non-shared receive queue when handling a "too many qps"
failure.

The code unwinds the mmmap info by decrementing a reference
count which will call rvt_release_mmap_info() which in turn
does the vfree() of the r_rq.wq.  The unwind code then does
the same free.

Fix by guarding the vfree() with the same test that is done
in close and only do the vfree() if qp->ip is NULL.
