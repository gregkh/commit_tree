staging: lustre: llite: remove lloop device

The lloop device was original developed to work around
the lack of direct I/O for the default loop back device.
Also the lloop device greatly out performed the default
loop back device. The lloop hasn't been worked on for
some time and now it no longer out performs the loop
device and loop now supports direct I/O. Since this is
the case we can delete this device.
