staging/android: store last signaled value on sync timeline

Now fence timeline is aware of the last signaled fence, as it
receives the increment to the current value in sync_timeline_signal().

That allow us to remove .has_signaled() from timeline_ops as we can
directly compare using timeline->value and fence->seqno in sync.c
