KVM: VMX: Add VMCS to CPU's loaded VMCSs before VMPTRLD

Kexec needs to know the addresses of all VMCSs that are active on
each CPU, so that it can flush them from the VMCS caches. It is
safe to record superfluous addresses that are not associated with
an active VMCS, but it is not safe to omit an address associated
with an active VMCS.

After a call to vmcs_load, the VMCS that was loaded is active on
the CPU. The VMCS should be added to the CPU's list of active
VMCSs before it is loaded.
