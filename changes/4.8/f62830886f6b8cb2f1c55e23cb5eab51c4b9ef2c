crypto: marvell - Check engine is not already running when enabling a req

Add a BUG_ON() call when the driver tries to launch a crypto request
while the engine is still processing the previous one. This replaces
a silent system hang by a verbose kernel panic with the associated
backtrace to let the user know that something went wrong in the CESA
driver.
