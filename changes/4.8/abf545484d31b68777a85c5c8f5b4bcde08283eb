mm/block: convert rw_page users to bio op use

The rw_page users were not converted to use bio/req ops. As a result
bdev_write_page is not passing down REQ_OP_WRITE and the IOs will
be sent down as reads.

Fixes: 4e1b2d52a80d ("block, fs, drivers: remove REQ_OP compat defs and related code")

Modified by me to:

1) Drop op_flags passing into ->rw_page(), as we don't use it.
2) Make op_is_write() and friends safe to use for !CONFIG_BLOCK
