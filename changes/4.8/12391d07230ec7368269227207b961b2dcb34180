nfsd: remove redundant zero-length check from create

lookup_one_len already has this check.

The only effect of this patch is to return access instead of perm in the
0-length-filename case.  I actually prefer nfserr_perm (or _inval?), but
I doubt anyone cares.

The isdotent check seems redundant too, but I worry that some client
might actually care about that strange nfserr_exist error.
