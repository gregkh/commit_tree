drm/i915: Register debugfs interface last

Currently debugfs files are created before the driver is even loads.
This gives the opportunity for userspace to open that interface and poke
around before the backing data structures are initialised - with the
possibility of oopsing or worse.

Move the creation of the debugfs files to our registration phase, where
we announce our presence to the world when we are ready, i.e the
sequence changes from

	drm_dev_register()
	 -> drm_minor_register()
	  -> drm_debugfs_init()
	   -> i915_debugfs_init()
	 -> i915_driver_load()

to

	drm_dev_register()
	 -> drm_minor_register()
	  -> drm_debugfs_init()
	 -> i915_driver_load()
	  -> i915_debugfs_register()
