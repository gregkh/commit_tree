usb: misc: usbtest: add fix for driver hang

In sg_timeout(), req->status is set to "-ETIMEDOUT" before calling
into usb_sg_cancel(). usb_sg_cancel() will do nothing and return
directly if req->status has been set to a non-zero value. This will
cause driver hang whenever transfer time out is triggered.

This patch fixes this issue. It could be backported to stable kernel
with version later than v3.15.
