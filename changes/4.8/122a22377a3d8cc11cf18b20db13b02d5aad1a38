PM / Domains: Stop/start devices during system PM suspend/resume in genpd

Not all subsystems/drivers that manages devices attached to a genpd
makes use of the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() helper functions
to deal with system PM suspend/resume.

In cases like these and when genpd's ->stop|start() callbacks are
used for the device, invoke the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume()
helper functions from genpd's "noirq" system PM callbacks. In this
way we make sure to "stop" the device on suspend and to "start" it
on resume.
