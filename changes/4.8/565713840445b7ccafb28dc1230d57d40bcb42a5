powerpc: Move 32-bit probe() machine to later in the boot process

This converts all the 32-bit platforms to use the expanded device-tree
which is a pretty mechanical change. Unlike 64-bit, the 32-bit kernel
didn't rely on platform initializations to setup the MMU since it
sets it up entirely before probe_machine() so the move has comparatively
less consequences though it's a bigger patch.
