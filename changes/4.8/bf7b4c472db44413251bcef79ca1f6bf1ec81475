locking/rwsem: Improve reader wakeup code

In __rwsem_do_wake(), the reader wakeup code will assume a writer
has stolen the lock if the active reader/writer count is not 0.
However, this is not as reliable an indicator as the original
"< RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS" check. If another reader is present, the code
will still break out and exit even if the writer is gone. This patch
changes it to check the same "< RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS" condition to
reduce the chance of false positive.
