clk: hi6220: Change syspll and media_syspll clk to 1.19GHz

In the bootloader of HiKey/96boards, syspll and media_syspll clk
was initialized to 1.19GHz. So, here changes it in kernel accordingly.

1.19GHz was chosen over 1.2GHz because at 1.19GHz we get more precise
HDMI pixel clock (1.19G/16 = 74.4MHz) for 1280x720p@60Hz HDMI
(74.25MHz required by standards). Closer pixel clock means better
compatibility to HDMI monitors.
