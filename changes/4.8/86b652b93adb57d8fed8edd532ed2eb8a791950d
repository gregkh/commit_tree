ocfs2/dlm: disable BUG_ON when DLM_LOCK_RES_DROPPING_REF is cleared before dlm_deref_lockres_done_handler

We found a BUG situation in which DLM_LOCK_RES_DROPPING_REF is cleared
unexpected that described below.  To solve the bug, we disable the
BUG_ON and purge lockres in dlm_do_local_recovery_cleanup.

Node 1                               Node 2(master)
dlm_purge_lockres
                                     dlm_deref_lockres_handler

                                     DLM_LOCK_RES_SETREF_INPROG is set
                                     response DLM_DEREF_RESPONSE_INPROG

receive DLM_DEREF_RESPONSE_INPROG
stop puring in dlm_purge_lockres
and wait for DLM_DEREF_RESPONSE_DONE

                                     dispatch dlm_deref_lockres_worker
                                     response DLM_DEREF_RESPONSE_DONE

receive DLM_DEREF_RESPONSE_DONE and
prepare to purge lockres

                                     Node 2 goes down

find Node2 down and do local
clean up for Node2:
dlm_do_local_recovery_cleanup
  -> clear DLM_LOCK_RES_DROPPING_REF

when purging lockres, BUG_ON happens
because DLM_LOCK_RES_DROPPING_REF is clear:
dlm_deref_lockres_done_handler
  ->BUG_ON(!(res->state & DLM_LOCK_RES_DROPPING_REF));
