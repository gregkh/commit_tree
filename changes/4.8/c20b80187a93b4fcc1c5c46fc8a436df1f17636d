mlxsw: spectrum: Add missing packet traps

Add the following traps:

1) MTU Error: Trap packets whose size is bigger than the egress RIF's
MTU. If DF bit isn't set, traffic will continue to be routed in slow
path.

2) TTL Error: Trap packets whose TTL expired. This allows traceroute to
work properly.

3) OSPF packets.
