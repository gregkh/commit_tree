pinctrl: uniphier: introduce capability flag

The core part of the UniPhier pinctrl driver needs to support a new
capability for upcoming UniPhier ARMv8 SoCs.  This sometimes happens
because pinctrl drivers include really SoC-specific stuff.

This commit intends to tidy up SoC-specific parameters of the existing
drivers before adding the new one.  Having just one flag would be
better than adding a new struct member every time a new SoC-specific
capability comes up.

At this time, there is one flag, UNIPHIER_PINCTRL_CAPS_DBGMUX_SEPARATE.
This capability (I'd say rather quirk) was added for PH1-Pro4 and
PH1-Pro5 as requirement from a customer.  For those SoCs, one pin-mux
setting is controlled by the combination of two separate registers; the
LSB bits at register offset (8 * N) and the MSB bits at (8 * N + 4).
Because it is impossible to update two separate registers atomically,
the LOAD_PINCTRL register should be set in order to make the pin-mux
settings really effective.
