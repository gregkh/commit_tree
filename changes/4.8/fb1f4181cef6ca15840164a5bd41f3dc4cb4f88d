ACPI / NUMA: remove unneeded acpi_numa=1

acpi_numa is default to 0, it's set to -1 when disable acpi numa or
when a bad SRAT is parsed, and it's only consumed in srat_disabled()
(compare it with 0) to continue parse the SRAT or not, so we don't
need to set acpi_numa to 1 when we get a valid SRAT entry.
