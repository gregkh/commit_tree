samples/kretprobe: fix the wrong type

The regs_return_value() returns "unsigned long" or "long" value.  But the
retval is int type now, it may cause overflow, the log may becomes:

    [ 2911.078869] do_brk returned -2003877888 and took 4620 ns to execute

This patch converts the retval to "unsigned long" type, and fixes the
overflow issue.
