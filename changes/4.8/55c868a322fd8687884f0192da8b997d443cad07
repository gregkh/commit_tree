drm/nouveau: Forbid runtime pm on driver unload

The PCI core calls pm_runtime_forbid() on device probe in pci_pm_init(),
making this the default state when nouveau is loaded. nouveau_drm_load()
therefore calls pm_runtime_allow(), but there's no pm_runtime_forbid()
in nouveau_drm_unload() to balance it. Add it so that we leave the
device in the same state that we found it.

This isn't a bug, it's just good housekeeping. When nouveau is first
loaded with runpm=1, then unloaded and loaded again with runpm=0,
pm_runtime_forbid() will be called from nouveau_pmops_runtime_idle() or
nouveau_pmops_runtime_suspend(), so the behaviour is correct. The nvidia
blob doesn't use runtime pm, but if it ever does, this commit avoids
that it has to clean up behind nouveau.
