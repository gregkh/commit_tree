drm/i915: Remove stallcheck special handling, v3.

Both intel_unpin_work.pending and intel_unpin_work.enable_stall_check
were used to see if work should be enabled. By only using pending
some special cases are gone, and access to unpin_work can be simplified.

A flip could previously be queued before
stallcheck was active. With the addition of the pending member
enable_stall_check became obsolete and can thus be removed.

Use this to only access work members untilintel_mark_page_flip_active
is called, or intel_queue_mmio_flip is used. This will prevent
use-after-free, and makes it easier to verify accesses.

Changes since v1:
- Reword commit message.
- Do not access unpin_work after intel_mark_page_flip_active.
- Add the right memory barriers.
Changes since v2:
- atomic_read() needs a full smp_rmb.
