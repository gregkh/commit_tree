powerpc/powernv: Make pnv_powersave_common more generic

pnv_powersave_common does common steps needed before entering idle
state and eventually changes MSR to MSR_IDLE and does rfid to
pnv_enter_arch207_idle_mode.

Move the updation of HSTATE_HWTHREAD_STATE to pnv_powersave_common
from pnv_enter_arch207_idle_mode and make it more generic by passing the
rfid address as a function parameter.
