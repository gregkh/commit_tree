iio: pressure: bmp280: add SPI interface driver

This patch mimics the SPI functionality found in the misc driver in
drivers/misc/bh085-spi.c to make it possible to reuse the existing
BMP280/BMP180/BMP085 driver with all clients of the other driver.
The adoption is straight-forward since like the other driver, it is
a simple matter of using regmap.

This driver is also so obviously inspired/copied from the old misc
driver in drivers/misc/bmp085.c that I just took the liberty to
add in the authors of the other drivers + self in the core driver
file.

The MISC driver also supports a variant named "BMP181" so include
that here to be complete in comparison to the old driver.

The bus mapping code for SPI was written by Akinobu Mita.
