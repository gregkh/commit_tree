MIPS: KVM: Add kvm_aux trace event

Add a MIPS specific trace event for auxiliary context operations
(notably FPU and MSA). Unfortunately the generic kvm_fpu trace event
isn't flexible enough to handle the range of interesting things that can
happen with FPU and MSA context.

The type of state being operated on is traced:
- FPU: Just the FPU registers.
- MSA: Just the upper half of the MSA vector registers (low half already
       loaded with FPU state).
- FPU & MSA: Full MSA vector state (includes FPU state).

As is the type of operation:
- Restore: State was enabled and restored.
- Save: State was saved and disabled.
- Enable: State was enabled (already loaded).
- Disable: State was disabled (kept loaded).
- Discard: State was discarded and disabled.
