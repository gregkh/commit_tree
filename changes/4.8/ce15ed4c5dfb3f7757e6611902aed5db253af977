USB: Fix of_usb_get_dr_mode_by_phy with a shared phy block

Some SoCs have a single phy-hw-block with multiple phys, this is
modelled by a single phy dts node, so we end up with multiple
controller nodes with a phys property pointing to the phy-node
of the otg-phy.

Only one of these controllers typically is an otg controller, yet we
were checking the first controller who uses a phy from the block and
then end up looking for a dr_mode property in e.g. the ehci controller.

This commit fixes this by adding an arg0 parameter to
of_usb_get_dr_mode_by_phy and make of_usb_get_dr_mode_by_phy
check that this matches the phandle args[0] value when looking for
the otg controller.
