x86/pci, x86/platform/intel_mid_pci: Remove duplicate power off code

Intel MID platforms (Moorestown, Medfield, Clovertrail, Merrifield) are
sharing the code in the intel_mid_pci.c module. There is no need to
power off specific Moorestown devices after the following commit:

  5823d0893ec2 ("x86/platform/intel-mid: Add Power Management Unit driver")

... because the condition in mrfld_power_off_dev() is true for any platform
from the above list.

Remove duplicate power off certain devices on Intel Moorestown and rename
the affected functions to show that they are applied to any of Intel MID
platforms.
