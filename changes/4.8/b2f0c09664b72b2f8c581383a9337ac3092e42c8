iio: sw-trigger: Fix config group initialization

Use the IS_ENABLED() helper macro to ensure that the configfs group is
initialized either when configfs is built-in or when configfs is built as a
module. Otherwise software trigger creation will result in undefined
behaviour when configfs is built as a mdoule since the configfs group for
the trigger is not properly initialized.
