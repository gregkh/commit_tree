drm/i915: Treat kernel context as initialised

The kernel context exists simply as a placeholder and should never be
executed with a render context. It does not need the golden render
state, as that will always be applied to a user context. By skipping the
initialisation we can avoid issues in attempting to program the golden
render context when trying to make the hardware idle.

v2: Rebase
