staging/lustre/mdc: Zero atime in close RPC

While atime on close is supposed to only increase, there's
a bug in some older server versions where atime from a client
is taken no matter the value that allows a stale client atime
to overwrite a correct value.

Update atime in close rpc to 0 to help such servers out.
