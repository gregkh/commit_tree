powerpc/powernv: Create PEs in pcibios_setup_bridge()

Currently, the PEs and their associated resources are assigned in
ppc_md.pcibios_fixup() except those used by SRIOV VFs. The function
is called for once after PCI probing and resources assignment is
completed. So it's obviously not hotplug friendly.

This creates PEs dynamically in pcibios_setup_bridge() that is
called for the event during system bootup and PCI hotplug: updating
PCI bridge's windows after resource assignment/reassignment are done.
In partial hotplug case, not all PCI devices included to one particular
PE are unplugged and plugged again, we just need unbinding/binding the
hot added PCI devices with the corresponding PE without creating new
one. The change is applied to IODA1 and IODA2 PHBs only. The behaviour
on NPU PHBs aren't changed. There are no PCI bridges on NPU PHBs,
meaning pcibios_setup_bridge() won't be invoked there. We have to use
old path (pnv_pci_ioda_fixup()) to setup PEs on NPU PHBs.
