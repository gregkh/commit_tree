regulator: pwm: Support extra continuous mode cases

The continuous mode allows one to declare a PWM regulator without having
to declare the voltage <-> dutycycle association table. It works fine as
long as your voltage(dutycycle) function is linear, but also has the
following constraints:

- dutycycle for min_uV = 0%
- dutycycle for max_uV = 100%
- dutycycle for min_uV < dutycycle for max_uV

While the linearity constraint is acceptable for now, we sometimes need to
restrict of the PWM range (to limit the maximum/minimum voltage for
example) or have a min_uV_dutycycle > max_uV_dutycycle (this could be
tweaked with PWM polarity, but not all PWMs support inverted polarity).

Add the pwm-dutycycle-range and pwm-dutycycle-unit DT properties to define
such constraints. If those properties are not defined, the PWM regulator
use the default pwm-dutycycle-range = <0 100> and
pwm-dutycycle-unit = <100> values (existing behavior).
