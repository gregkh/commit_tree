drm/i915: optimise i915_gem_object_map() for small objects

We're using this function for ringbuffers and other "small" objects, so
it's worth avoiding an extra malloc()/free() cycle if the page array is
small enough to put on the stack. Here we've chosen an arbitrary cutoff
of 32 (4k) pages, which is big enough for a ringbuffer (4 pages) or a
context image (currently up to 22 pages).
