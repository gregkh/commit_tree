xprtrdma: Remove rpcrdma_map_one() and friends

Clean up: ALLPHYSICAL is gone and FMR has been converted to use
scatterlists. There are no more users of these functions.

This patch shrinks the size of struct rpcrdma_req by about 3500
bytes on x86_64. There is one of these structs for each RPC credit
(128 credits per transport connection).
