iwlwifi: mvm: remove RX_PHY support for 9000 device

In multiple RX queues architecture, the RX_PHY notification
is no longer useful as it is received in the default queue
even for packets that are received on RSS queue, and cannot
be accessed without locking.
All the needed data is in the new RX packet metadata and
firmware will no longer send this notification for 9000
devices. Remove support of it.
