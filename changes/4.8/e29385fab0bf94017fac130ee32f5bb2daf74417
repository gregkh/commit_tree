rtc: ds1307: Fix relying on reset value for weekday

The reset value of weekday is 0x1. This is wrong since
the reset values of the day/month/year make up to Jan 1 2001.
When computed weekday comes out to be Monday. On a scale
of 1-7(Sunday - Saturday) it should be 0x2. So we should not
be relying on the reset value.

Hence compute the wday using the current date/month/year values.
Check if reset wday is any different from the computed wday,
If different then set the wday which we computed using
date/month/year values.
