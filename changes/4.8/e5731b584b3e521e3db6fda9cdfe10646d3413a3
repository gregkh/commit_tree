rcutorture/doc: Create initrd using dracut

Using dracut is another way to get an initramfs for KVM-based RCU
torture tests, which is more flexible than using the host's initramfs
image, because modules and binaries may be added or removed via dracut
command options. So add an example in the document, in case that there
are some situations where host's initramfs couldn't be used.
