spi: s3c64xx: do not disable the clock while configuring the spi

When the clock is coming from the cmu it is not required to be
disabled and then re-enabled in order to change the rate.

Besides, some exynos chipsets (e.g. exynos5433) do not deliver
any to the SFR if one from the pclk ("spi" in this case) or sclk
("busclk") is disabled.

Remove the clock disabling/enabling to avoid falling into this
situation.
