KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Implement MSI injection in ITS emulation

When userland wants to inject an MSI into the guest, it uses the
KVM_SIGNAL_MSI ioctl, which carries the doorbell address along with
the payload and the device ID.
With the help of the KVM IO bus framework we learn the corresponding
ITS from the doorbell address. We then use our wrapper functions to
iterate the linked lists and find the proper Interrupt Translation Table
Entry (ITTE) and thus the corresponding struct vgic_irq to finally set
the pending bit.
We also provide the handler for the ITS "INT" command, which allows a
guest to trigger an MSI via the ITS command queue. Since this one knows
about the right ITS already, we directly call the MMIO handler function
without using the kvm_io_bus framework.
