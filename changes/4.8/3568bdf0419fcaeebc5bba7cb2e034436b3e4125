net: davinci_cpdma: remove excessive dump of register values to kernel log

Such a big dump of register values is hardly useful on a production
system.

Another downside of the now removed functions is that calling
emac_dump_regs resulted in at least 87 calls to dev_info while holding a
spinlock and having irqs off which is a big source of latency.
