rtc: ds1685: correct day of month checking

The day of month is checked in ds1685_rtc_read_alarm
and ds1685_rtc_set_alarm.

Multiple errors exist in the day of month check.

Operator ! has a higher priority than &&.
(!(mday >= 1) && (mday <= 31)) is false for mday == 32.

When verifying the day of month the binary and the BCD mode
have to be considered.
