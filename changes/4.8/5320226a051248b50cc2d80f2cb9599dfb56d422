mmc: core: Disable HPI for certain Hynix eMMC cards

Certain Hynix eMMC 4.41 cards might get broken when HPI feature is used
and hence this patch disables the HPI feature for such buggy cards.

As some of the other features like BKOPs/Cache/Sanitize are dependent on
HPI feature, those features would also get disabled if HPI is disabled.
