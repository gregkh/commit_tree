drm/i915: Limit i915_ring_test_irq debugfs to actual rings

For simplicity in testing, only report known rings in the mask. This
allows userspace to try and trigger a missed irq on every ring and do a
comparison between i915_ring_test_irq and i915_ring_missed_irq to see if
any rings failed.

v2: Move the debug message to after the rings are selected (so that the
message accurately reflects reality)
