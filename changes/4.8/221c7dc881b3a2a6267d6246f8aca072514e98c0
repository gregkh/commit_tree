dax: some small updates to dax.txt documentation

These are originally from Matthew Wilcox and were part of his huge
"mm,fs,dax: Change ->pmd_fault to ->huge_fault" patch that was part of
PUD support.

I'm breaking these small changes out as they stand on their own and add
useful information to Documentation/filesystems/dax.txt.
