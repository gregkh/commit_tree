mm, page_alloc: fix dirtyable highmem calculation

When I tested vmscale in mmtest in 32bit, I found the benchmark was slow
down 0.5 times.

                base        node
                   1    global-1
User           12.98       16.04
System        147.61      166.42
Elapsed        26.48       38.08

With vmstat, I found IO wait avg is much increased compared to base.

The reason was highmem_dirtyable_memory accumulates free pages and
highmem_file_pages from HIGHMEM to MOVABLE zones which was wrong.  With
that, dirth_thresh in throtlle_vm_write is always 0 so that it calls
congestion_wait frequently if writeback starts.

With this patch, it is much recovered.

                base        node          fi
                   1    global-1         fix
User           12.98       16.04       13.78
System        147.61      166.42      143.92
Elapsed        26.48       38.08       29.64
