ALSA: seq_timer: use monotonic times internally

The sequencer client manager reports timestamps in units of unsigned
32-bit seconds/nanoseconds, but that does not suffer from the y2038
overflow because it stores only the delta since the 'last_update'
time was recorded.

However, the use of the do_gettimeofday() function is problematic
and we have to replace it to avoid the overflow on on 32-bit
architectures.

This uses 'struct timespec64' to record 'last_update', and changes
the code to use monotonic timestamps that do not suffer from leap
seconds and settimeofday updates.

As a side-effect, the code can now use the timespec64_sub() helper
and become more readable and also avoid a multiplication to convert
from microseconds to nanoseconds.
