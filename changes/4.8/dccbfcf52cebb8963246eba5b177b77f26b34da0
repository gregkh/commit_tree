KVM: nVMX: postpone VMCS changes on MSR_IA32_APICBASE write

If vmcs12 does not intercept APIC_BASE writes, then KVM will handle the
write with vmcs02 as the current VMCS.
This will incorrectly apply modifications intended for vmcs01 to vmcs02
and L2 can use it to gain access to L0's x2APIC registers by disabling
virtualized x2APIC while using msr bitmap that assumes enabled.

Postpone execution of vmx_set_virtual_x2apic_mode until vmcs01 is the
current VMCS.  An alternative solution would temporarily make vmcs01 the
current VMCS, but it requires more care.
