ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Runtime resume bridges before bus rescans

If a PCI bridge (or PCIe port) that is runtime-suspended gets an ACPI
hotplug notification, such as a bus check, it has to be resumed before
re-scanning the devices below it, or those devices will not be
accessible and will be treated as hot-removed.

Make that happen and let the bridge suspend again after the bus below it
has been re-scanned.

This is a replacement for commit 16468c783cb4 ("ACPI / hotplug / PCI:
Runtime resume bridge before rescan") that has been reverted, because it
introduced a system resume regression (due to missing bridge->pci_dev
checks that are necessary in case the notification is targeted at the
host bridge) and it is necessary for the code added by commit
006d44e49a25 ("PCI: Add runtime PM support for PCIe ports") to work as
expected.
