crypto: authencesn - Use skcipher

This patch converts authencesn to use the new skcipher interface as
opposed to ablkcipher.

It also fixes a little bug where if a sync version of authencesn
is requested we may still end up using an async ahash.  This should
have no effect as none of the authencesn users can request for a
sync authencesn.
