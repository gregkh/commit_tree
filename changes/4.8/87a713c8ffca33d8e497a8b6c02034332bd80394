8250/fintek: rename IRQ_MODE macro

A bugfix for the fintek driver required defining some macros, but
one of them clashes with a system header on ARM:

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_fintek.c:34:0: error: "IRQ_MODE" redefined [-Werror]
 #define IRQ_MODE 0x70

This renames the newly introduced 'IRQ_MODE' macro to FINTEK_IRQ_MODE.
