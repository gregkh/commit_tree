drm/i915: Name the inner most per-engine intel_context struct

We want to give a name to the currently anonymous per-engine struct
inside the context, so that we can assign it to a local variable and
save clumsy typing. The name we have chosen is intel_context as it
reflects the HW facing portion of the context state (the logical context
state, the registers, the ringbuffer etc).
