nfsd: Close race between nfsd4_release_lockowner and nfsd4_lock

nfsd4_release_lockowner finds a lock owner that has no lock state,
and drops cl_lock. Then release_lockowner picks up cl_lock and
unhashes the lock owner.

During the window where cl_lock is dropped, I don't see anything
preventing a concurrent nfsd4_lock from finding that same lock owner
and adding lock state to it.

Move release_lockowner() into nfsd4_release_lockowner and hang onto
the cl_lock until after the lock owner's state cannot be found
again.

Found by inspection, we don't currently have a reproducer.
