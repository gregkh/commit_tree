MIPS: KVM: Check MSA presence at uasm time

Check for presence of MSA at uasm assembly time rather than at runtime
in the generated KVM host entry code. This optimises the guest exit path
by eliminating the MSA code entirely if not present, and eliminating the
read of Config3.MSAP and conditional branch if MSA is present.
