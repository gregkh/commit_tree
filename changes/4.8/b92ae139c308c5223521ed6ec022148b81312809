rapidio/rio_cm: avoid GFP_KERNEL in atomic context

As reported by Alexey Khoroshilov (https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/9/9/737):
riocm_send_close() is called from rio_cm_shutdown() under
spin_lock_bh(idr_lock), but riocm_send_close() uses a GFP_KERNEL
allocation.

Fix by taking riocm_send_close() outside of spinlock protected code.
