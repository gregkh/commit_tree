MAINTAINERS: Update my e-mail

I will be starting employment at Versity next week and would like to update
my MAINTAINERS e-mail to reflect that change. My versity e-mail is already
activated so I shouldn't get any bounces on the new one. My ability to help
with Ocfs2 kernel maintenance won't change as a result of the new job.
