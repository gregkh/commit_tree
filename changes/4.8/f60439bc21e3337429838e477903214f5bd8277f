ixgbe: Force VLNCTRL.VFE to be set in all VMDq paths

When I was adding the code for enabling VLAN promiscuous mode with SR-IOV
enabled I had inadvertently left the VLNCTRL.VFE bit unchanged as I has
assumed there was code in another path that was setting it when we enabled
SR-IOV.  This wasn't the case and as a result we were just disabling VLAN
filtering for all the VFs apparently.

Also the previous patches were always clearing CFIEN which was always set
to 0 by the hardware anyway so I am dropping the redundant bit clearing.
