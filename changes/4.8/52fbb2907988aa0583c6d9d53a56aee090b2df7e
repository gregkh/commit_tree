net: sched: fix qdisc->running lockdep annotations

1) qdisc_run_begin() is really using the equivalent of a trylock.
  Instead of using write_seqcount_begin(), use a combination of
  raw_write_seqcount_begin() and correct lockdep annotation.

2) sch_direct_xmit() should use regular spin_lock(root_lock)
