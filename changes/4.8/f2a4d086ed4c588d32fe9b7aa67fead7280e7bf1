openvswitch: Add packet truncation support.

The patch adds a new OVS action, OVS_ACTION_ATTR_TRUNC, in order to
truncate packets. A 'max_len' is added for setting up the maximum
packet size, and a 'cutlen' field is to record the number of bytes
to trim the packet when the packet is outputting to a port, or when
the packet is sent to userspace.
