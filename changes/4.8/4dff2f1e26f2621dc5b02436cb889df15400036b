dm raid: clarify and fix recovery

Add function rs_setup_recovery() to allow for defined setup of RAID set
recovery in the constructor.

Will be called with dev_sectors={0, rdev->sectors, MaxSectors} to
recover a new or enforced sync, grown or not to be synhronized RAID set
respectively.

Prevents recovery on raid0, which doesn't support it.

Enforces recovery on raid6 to ensure properly defined Syndromes
mandatory for that MD personality are being created.
