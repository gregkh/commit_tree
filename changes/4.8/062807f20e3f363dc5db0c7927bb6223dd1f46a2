tpm: Remove all uses of drvdata from the TPM Core

The final thing preventing this was the way the sysfs files were
attached to the pdev. Follow the approach developed for ppi and move
the sysfs files to the chip->dev with symlinks from the pdev
for compatibility. Everything in the core now sanely uses container_of
to get the chip.
