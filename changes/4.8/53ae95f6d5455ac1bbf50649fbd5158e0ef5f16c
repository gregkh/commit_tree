ARM: OMAP3: McBSP: New callback for McBSP2/3 ICLK idle configuration

McBSP2/3 module's sidetone module operates using the module's ICLK clock.
When the Sidetone is in use the interface clock of the module must not
idle. The new callback expects to receive the *clk of the module's ick and
not the id number of the McBSP. This will allow us more cleanups and going
to simplify the ICLK handling.
