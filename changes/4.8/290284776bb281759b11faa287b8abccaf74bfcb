regulator: qcom_smd: Fix voltage ranges for pm8x41

The voltage ranges listed here are wrong. The correct ranges can
be seen in the "native" spmi regulator driver
qcom_spmi-regulator.c at pldo_ranges[], ftsmps_ranges[] and
boost_ranges[] for the pldo, ftsmps, and boost type regulators.
Port these ranges over to the RPM SMD regulator driver so that we
list the appropriate set of supported voltages on pldos.

Doing this allows us to specify a voltage like 3075000 for l24,
whereas before that wasn't a supported voltage.
