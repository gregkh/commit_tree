x86/KASLR: Randomize virtual address separately

The current KASLR implementation randomizes the physical and virtual
addresses of the kernel together (both are offset by the same amount). It
calculates the delta of the physical address where vmlinux was linked
to load and where it is finally loaded. If the delta is not equal to 0
(i.e. the kernel was relocated), relocation handling needs be done.

On 64-bit, this patch randomizes both the physical address where kernel
is decompressed and the virtual address where kernel text is mapped and
will execute from. We now have two values being chosen, so the function
arguments are reorganized to pass by pointer so they can be directly
updated. Since relocation handling only depends on the virtual address,
we must check the virtual delta, not the physical delta for processing
kernel relocations. This also populates the page table for the new
virtual address range. 32-bit does not support a separate virtual address,
so it continues to use the physical offset for its virtual offset.

Additionally updates the sanity checks done on the resulting kernel
addresses since they are potentially separate now.
