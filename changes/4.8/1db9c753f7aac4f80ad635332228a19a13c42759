ARM: dts: sun8i-h3: Add dts file for Sinovoip BPI-M2+

The BPI-M2+ is an H3 development board. It is a smaller form factor than
the original BPI-M2, with the new H3 SoC.

It has 1GB DRAM, 8GB eMMC, a micro SD card slot, HDMI output, 2 USB
host connector and 1 USB OTG connector, an IR receiver, WiFi+BT based
on Ampak AP6212.

The board also has a 3 pin header for (debug) UART, a 40 pin GPIO header
based on the Raspberry Pi B+, but the peripheral signals are not the
same, and an FPC connector for connecting BPI's camera.
