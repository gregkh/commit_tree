perf/x86/intel/uncore: Locate specific box by checking full device info

Some platforms, e.g. Knights Landing, use a common PCI device ID for
multiple instances of an uncore PMU device type. So it is impossible to
locate the specific instances only by PCI device ID.

The current code specially handles Knights Landing by arbitrarily pointing
an instance to an unused uncore box. However, we still have no idea
which uncore device is mapped to which box.

Furthermore, there could be more platforms which use a common PCI device ID
for uncore devices. We have to specially handle them one by one.

This patch records full device information (slot, func, and device ID)
in id_table[]. So the probe function can point the instance to a specific
uncore box by checking the full device information.
