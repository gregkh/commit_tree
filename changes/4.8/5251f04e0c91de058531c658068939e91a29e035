drm/i915: Remove intel_prepare_page_flip, v3.

Instead of calling prepare_flip right before calling finish_page_flip
do everything from prepare_page_flip in finish_page_flip.

Putting prepare and finish page_flip in a single step removes the need
for INTEL_FLIP_COMPLETE, so it can be removed. This simplifies the code
slightly.

Changes since v1:
- Invert if case to simplify code.
- Add missing barrier.
- Reword commit message.
Changes since v2:
- intel_page_flip_plane is removed.
- work->pending is turned into a bool.
