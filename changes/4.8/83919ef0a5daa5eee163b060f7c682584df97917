ARM: dts: Ux500: fix up TVK sensor data

- Fix the I2C address and supply line names for the AK8974

- Sets up the interrupt lines to the different components as they
  actually are connected, I was confused for some time by the fact
  that several lines were connected with <NM> 0 Ohm resistors, which
  means NOT MOUNTED and is thus not 0 Ohm at all but infinite ohms,
  i.e. not connected at all.
