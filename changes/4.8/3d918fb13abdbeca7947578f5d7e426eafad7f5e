perf intel-pt: Fix occasional decoding errors when tracing system-wide

In order to successfully decode Intel PT traces, context switch events
are needed from the moment the trace starts. Currently that is ensured
by using the 'immediate' flag which enables the switch event when it is
opened.

However, since commit 86c2786994bd ("perf intel-pt: Add support for
PERF_RECORD_SWITCH") that might not always happen. When tracing
system-wide the context switch event is added to the tracking event
which was not set as 'immediate'. Change that so it is.
