regmap: drop cache if the bus transfer error

regmap_write
->_regmap_raw_write
-->regcache_write first and than use map->bus->write to wirte i2c or spi
But if the i2c or spi transfer failed, But the cache is updated, So if I use
regmap_read will get the cache data which is not the real register value.
