cxl: Add cxl_check_and_switch_mode() API to switch bi-modal cards

Add a new API, cxl_check_and_switch_mode() to allow for switching of
bi-modal CAPI cards, such as the Mellanox CX-4 network card.

When a driver requests to switch a card to CAPI mode, use PCI hotplug
infrastructure to remove all PCI devices underneath the slot. We then write
an updated mode control register to the CAPI VSEC, hot reset the card, and
reprobe the card.

As the card may present a different set of PCI devices after the mode
switch, use the infrastructure provided by the pnv_php driver and the OPAL
PCI slot management facilities to ensure that:

  * the old devices are removed from both the OPAL and Linux device trees
  * the new devices are probed by OPAL and added to the OPAL device tree
  * the new devices are added to the Linux device tree and probed through
    the regular PCI device probe path

As such, introduce a new option, CONFIG_CXL_BIMODAL, with a dependency on
the pnv_php driver.

Refactor existing code that touches the mode control register in the
regular single mode case into a new function, setup_cxl_protocol_area().
