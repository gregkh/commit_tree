kexec: use core_param for crash_kexec_post_notifiers boot option

crash_kexec_post_notifiers ia a boot option which controls whether the
1st kernel calls panic notifiers or not before booting the 2nd kernel.
However, there is no need to limit it to being modifiable only at boot
time.  So, use core_param instead of early_param.
