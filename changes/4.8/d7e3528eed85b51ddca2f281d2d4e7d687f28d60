irqchip: bcm2835: Avoid arch/arm-specific handle_IRQ

With commit

  76ba59f8366f genirq: Add irq_domain-aware core IRQ handler

architecture-specific irq handlers are no longer necessary.  Update the bcm2835
irq driver to use the core irq handler.  As a bonus, this allows the driver to
support arm64 as well.
