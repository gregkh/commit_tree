net_sched: move tc_action into tcf_common

struct tc_action is confusing, currently we use it for two purposes:
1) Pass in arguments and carry out results from helper functions
2) A generic representation for tc actions

The first one is error-prone, since we need to make sure we don't
miss anything. This patch aims to get rid of this use, by moving
tc_action into tcf_common, so that they are allocated together
in hashtable and can be cast'ed easily.

And together with the following patch, we could really make
tc_action a generic representation for all tc actions and each
type of action can inherit from it.
