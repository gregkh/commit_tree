KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Introduce ITS emulation file with MMIO framework

The ARM GICv3 ITS emulation code goes into a separate file, but needs
to be connected to the GICv3 emulation, of which it is an option.
The ITS MMIO handlers require the respective ITS pointer to be passed in,
so we amend the existing VGIC MMIO framework to let it cope with that.
Also we introduce the basic ITS data structure and initialize it, but
don't return any success yet, as we are not yet ready for the show.
