tpm: fix crash in tpm_tis deinitialization

rmmod crashes the driver because tpm_chip_unregister() already sets ops
to NULL. This commit fixes the issue by moving tpm2_shutdown() to
tpm_chip_unregister(). This commit is also cleanup because it removes
duplicate code from tpm_crb and tpm_tis to the core.
