drm/i915: Update GEN6_PMINTRMSK setup with GuC enabled

On Loading, GuC sets PM interrupts routing (bit 31) and clears ARAT
expired interrupt (bit 9). Host turbo also updates this register
in RPS flows. This patch ensures bit 31 and bit 9 setup by GuC persists.
ARAT timer interrupt is needed in GuC for various features. It also
facilitates halting GuC and hence achieving RC6. PM interrupt routing
will not impact RPS interrupt reception by host as GuC will redirect
them.
This patch fixes igt test pm_rc6_residency that was failing with guc
load/submission enabled. Tested with SKL GuC v6.1 and BXT GuC v5.1 and v8.7.

v2: i915_irq/i915_pm decoupling from intel_guc. (ChrisW)

v3: restructuring the mask update and rebase w.r.t Ville's patch. (ChrisW)

v4: Updating the pm_intr_keep during direct_interrupts_to_guc. (Sagar)
