lkdtm: split build into multiple source files

Kbuild lacks a way to do in-place objcopy or other modifications of
built targets, so in order to move functions into non-text sections
without renaming the kernel module, the build of lkdtm must be split
into separate source files. This renames lkdtm.c to lkdtm_core.c in
preparation for adding the source file for the .rodata section.
