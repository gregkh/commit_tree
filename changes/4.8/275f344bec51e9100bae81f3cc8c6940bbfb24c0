arm64: add macro to extract ESR_ELx.EC

Several places open-code extraction of the EC field from an ESR_ELx
value, in subtly different ways. This is unfortunate duplication and
variation, and the precise logic used to extract the field is a
distraction.

This patch adds a new macro, ESR_ELx_EC(), to extract the EC field from
an ESR_ELx value in a consistent fashion.

Existing open-coded extractions in core arm64 code are moved over to the
new helper. KVM code is left as-is for the moment.
