x86/microcode/intel: Fix initrd loading with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY=y

CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY=y randomizes the physical memmap and thus the
address where the initrd is located. Therefore, we need to add the
offset KASLR put us to in order to find the initrd again on the AP path.

In the future, we will get rid of the initrd address caching and query
the address on both the BSP and AP paths but that would need more work.

Thanks to Nicolai Stange for the good bisection and debugging work.
