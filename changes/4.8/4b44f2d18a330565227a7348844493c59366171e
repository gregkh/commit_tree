random: add interrupt callback to VMBus IRQ handler

The Hyper-V Linux Integration Services use the VMBus implementation for
communication with the Hypervisor. VMBus registers its own interrupt
handler that completely bypasses the common Linux interrupt handling.
This implies that the interrupt entropy collector is not triggered.

This patch adds the interrupt entropy collection callback into the VMBus
interrupt handler function.
