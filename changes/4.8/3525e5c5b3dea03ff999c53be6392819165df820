max8903: removes non zero validity checks on gpios.

Prior to this commit a zero gpio was treated as invalid. Whereas
gpio_is_valid() will treat a zero gpio as valid.

This commit removes the confusion and explicitly uses gpio_is_valid()
throughout. Which in turn results in several of the error messages becoming
redundant and thus removed.
