cgroupns: Close race between cgroup_post_fork and copy_cgroup_ns

In most code paths involving cgroup migration cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem
is taken.  There are two exceptions:

- remove_tasks_in_empty_cpuset calls cgroup_transfer_tasks
- vhost_attach_cgroups_work calls cgroup_attach_task_all

With cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem held it is guaranteed that cgroup_post_fork
and copy_cgroup_ns will reference the same css_set from the process calling
fork.

Without such an interlock there process after fork could reference one
css_set from it's new cgroup namespace and another css_set from
task->cgroups, which semantically is nonsensical.
