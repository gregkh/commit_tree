sctp: move sent_count to the memory hole in sctp_chunk

Now pahole sctp_chunk, it has 2 memory holes:
   struct sctp_chunk {
	struct list_head           list;
	atomic_t                   refcnt;
	/* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */
	...
	long unsigned int          prsctp_param;
	int                        sent_count;
	/* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

This patch is to move up sent_count to fill the 1st one and eliminate
the 2nd one.

It's not just another struct compaction, it also fixes the "netperf-
Throughput_Mbps -37.2% regression" issue when overloading the CPU.
