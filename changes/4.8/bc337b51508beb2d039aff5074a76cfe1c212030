usb: ehci: change order of register cleanup during shutdown

In ehci_turn_off_all_ports() all EHCI port registers are cleared to zero.
On some hardware, this can lead to an system hang,
when ehci_port_power() accesses the already cleared registers.

This patch changes the order of cleanup.
First call ehci_port_power() which respects the current bits in
port status registers
and afterwards cleanup the hard way by setting everything to zero.
