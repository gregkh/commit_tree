pwm: atmel: Fix disabling of PWM channels

When disabling a PWM channel, the PWM clock was being stopped
immediately after writing to PWM_DIS. As a result, the disabling
of the PWM channel did not complete properly, and the PWM output
might be left at the wrong level.

Fix this by waiting for the channel to be effectively disabled
(by checking the PWM_SR register) before disabling the clock.
