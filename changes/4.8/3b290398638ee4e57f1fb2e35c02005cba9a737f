x86, asm: Use CC_SET()/CC_OUT() and static_cpu_has() in archrandom.h

Use CC_SET()/CC_OUT() and static_cpu_has().  This produces code good
enough to eliminate ad hoc use of alternatives in <asm/archrandom.h>,
greatly simplifying the code.

While we are at it, make x86_init_rdrand() compile out completely if
we don't need it.

v2: fix a conflict between <linux/random.h> and <asm/archrandom.h>
    discovered by Ingo Molnar.  There are a few places in x86-specific
    code where we need all of <arch/archrandom.h> even when
    CONFIG_ARCH_RANDOM is disabled, so <linux/random.h> does not
    suffice.
