module: fix noreturn attribute for __module_put_and_exit()

__module_put_and_exit() is makred noreturn in module.h declaration, but is
lacking the attribute in the definition, which makes some tools (such as
sparse) unhappy. Amend the definition with the attribute as well (and
reformat the declaration so that it uses more common format).
