PCI: Use positive flags in pci_alloc_irq_vectors()

Instead of passing negative flags like PCI_IRQ_NOMSI to prevent use of
certain interrupt types, pass positive flags like PCI_IRQ_LEGACY,
PCI_IRQ_MSI, etc., to specify the acceptable interrupt types.

This is based on a number of pending driver conversions that just happend
to be a whole more obvious to read this way, and given that we have no
users in the tree yet it can still easily be done.

I've also added a PCI_IRQ_ALL_TYPES catchall to keep the case of accepting
all interrupt types very simple.
