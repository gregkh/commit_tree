drm/i915: Rename and inline i915_gem_context_get()

i915_gem_context_get() is a very simple wrapper around idr_find(), so
simple that it would be smaller to do the lookup inline. Also we use the
verb 'lookup' to return a pointer from a handle, freeing 'get' to imply
obtaining a reference to the context.
