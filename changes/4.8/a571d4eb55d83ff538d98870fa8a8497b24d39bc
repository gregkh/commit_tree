mm/memblock.c: add new infrastructure to address the mem limit issue

In some cases, memblock is queried by kernel to determine whether a
specified address is RAM or not.  For example, the ACPI core needs this
information to determine which attributes to use when mapping ACPI
regions(acpi_os_ioremap).  Use of incorrect memory types can result in
faults, data corruption, or other issues.

Removing memory with memblock_enforce_memory_limit() throws away this
information, and so a kernel booted with 'mem=' may suffer from the
issues described above.  To avoid this, we need to keep those NOMAP
regions instead of removing all above the limit, which preserves the
information we need while preventing other use of those regions.

This patch adds new infrastructure to retain all NOMAP memblock regions
while removing others, to cater for this.
