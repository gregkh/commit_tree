rtc: cmos: move mc146818rtc code out of asm-generic/rtc.h

Drivers should not really include stuff from asm-generic directly,
and the PC-style cmos rtc driver does this in order to reuse the
mc146818 implementation of get_rtc_time/set_rtc_time rather than
the architecture specific one for the architecture it gets built for.

To make it more obvious what is going on, this moves and renames the
two functions into include/linux/mc146818rtc.h, which holds the
other mc146818 specific code. Ideally it would be in a .c file,
but that would require extra infrastructure as the functions are
called by multiple drivers with conflicting dependencies.

With this change, the asm-generic/rtc.h header also becomes much
more generic, so it can be reused more easily across any architecture
that still relies on the genrtc driver.

The only caller of the internal __get_rtc_time/__set_rtc_time
functions is in arch/alpha/kernel/rtc.c, and we just change those
over to the new naming.
