platform/olpc: Make ec explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig entry controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/x86/Kconfig:config OLPC
arch/x86/Kconfig:       bool "One Laptop Per Child support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
