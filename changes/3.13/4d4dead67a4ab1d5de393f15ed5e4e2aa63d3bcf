drm/i915/bdw: Add device IDs

v2: Squash in "drm/i915/bdw: Add BDW to the HAS_DDI check" as
suggested by Damien.

v3: Squash in VEBOX enabling from  Zhao Yakui <yakui.zhao@intel.com>

v4: Rebase on top of Jesse's patch to extract all pci ids to
include/drm/i915_pciids.h.

v4: Replace Halo by its marketing moniker Iris. Requested by Ben.

v5: Switch from info->has*ring to info->ring_mask.

v6: Add 0x16X2 variant (which is newer than this patch)
Rename to use new naming scheme (Chris)
Remove Simulator PCI ids. These snuck in during rebase (Chris)

v7: Fix poor sed job from v6
Make the desktop variants use the desktop macro (Rebase error). Notice
that this makes no functional difference - it's just confusing.
