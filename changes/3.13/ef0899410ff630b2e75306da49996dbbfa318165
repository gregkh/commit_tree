s390/dasd: hold request queue sysfs lock when calling elevator_init()

"elevator: Fix a race in elevator switching and md device initialization"
changed the semantics of elevator_init() in a way that now enforces to hold
the corresponding request queue's sysfs_lock when calling elevator_init()
to fix a race.
The patch did not convert the s390 dasd device driver which is the only
device driver which also calls elevator_init(). So add the missing locking.
