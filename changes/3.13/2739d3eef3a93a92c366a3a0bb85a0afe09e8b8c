sched/numa: Retry task_numa_migrate() periodically

Short spikes of CPU load can lead to a task being migrated
away from its preferred node for temporary reasons.

It is important that the task is migrated back to where it
belongs, in order to avoid migrating too much memory to its
new location, and generally disturbing a task's NUMA location.

This patch fixes NUMA placement for 4 specjbb instances on
a 4 node system. Without this patch, things take longer to
converge, and processes are not always completely on their
own node.
