ARM: DRA7: hwmod: Fix boot crash with DEBUG_LL

With commit '7dedd34: ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix a crash in _setup_reset() with
 DEBUG_LL' we moved from parsing cmdline to identify uart used for earlycon
to using the requsite hwmod CONFIG_DEBUG_OMAPxUARTy FLAGS.

On DRA7 though, we seem to be missing this flag, and atleast on the DRA7 EVM
where we use uart1 for console, boot fails with DEBUG_LL enabled.
