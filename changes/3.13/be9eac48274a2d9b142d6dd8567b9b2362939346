macvlan: introduce macvlan_dev_real_dev() helper function

Introduce helper function macvlan_dev_real_dev which returns the
underlying device of a macvlan device, similar to vlan_dev_real_dev()
for 802.1q VLAN devices.

v2: IFF_MACVLAN flag and equivalent of is_macvlan_dev() were
introduced in the meantime

v3: do BUG() if compiled without macvlan support
