micrel: add support for KSZ8041RNLI

Renesas R-Car development boards use KSZ8041RNLI PHY which for some reason has
ID of 0x00221537 that is not documented for KSZ8041-family PHYs and does not
match the  documented ID of  0x0022151x (where 'x' is the revision).  We have
to add the new #define PHY_ID_* and new ksphy_driver[] entry, almost the same
as KSZ8041 one, differing only in the 'phy_id' and 'name' fields.
