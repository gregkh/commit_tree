drm/i915: Avoid tweaking RPS before it is enabled

As we delay the initial RPS enabling (upon boot and after resume), there
is a chance that we may start to render and trigger RPS boosts before we
set up the punit. Any changes we make could result in inconsistent
hardware state, with a danger of causing undefined behaviour. However,
as the boosting is a optional tweak to RPS, we can simply ignore it
whilst RPS is not yet enabled.
