ASoC: wm8962: Turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling regulator

It's safer to turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling regulator since
the driver will turn off the regcache_cache_only after enabling regulator.

If we remain cache_only false, some command like 'amixer cset' would get
failure if being run before wm8962_resume().
