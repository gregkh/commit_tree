serial: imx: implement the flush_buffer hook

The current driver does not implement the flush_buffer hook for
uart_ops. When we enable the DMA for the driver, and test it with Bluetooth,
we may meet the following bug for TX:

    [1] User application may call the flush operation at any time.
        The uart_flush_buffer() calls the uart_circ_clear() to set
        the xmit->head and xmit->tail with 0.

    [2] The TX DMA callback can be called at any time too.
        The dma_tx_call() will update the xmit->tail.

    If [2] occurs just after the [1], we will get the wrong xmit->tail.

This patch implements the flush_buffer hook to fix this issue.
