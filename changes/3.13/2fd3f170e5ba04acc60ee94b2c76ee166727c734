ALSA: hda - Enable mute/mic-mute LEDs for more Thinkpads with Conexant codec

Most Thinkpad Edge series laptops use conexant codec, so far although
the codecs have different minor Vendor Id and minor Subsystem Id,
they all belong to the cxt5066 family, this change can make the
mute/mic-mute LEDs support more generic among cxt_5066 family.

This design refers to the similar solution for the realtek codec
ALC269 family in the patch_realtek.c.
