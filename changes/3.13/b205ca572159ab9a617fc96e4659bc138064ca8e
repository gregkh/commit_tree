drm/i915: Use unsigned for overflow checks in execbuf

There's actually no real risk since we already check for stricter
constraints earlier (using UINT_MAX / sizeof (struct
drm_i915_gem_exec_object2) as the limit). But in eb_create we use
signed integers, which steals a factor of 2. Luckily struct
drm_i915_gem_exec_object2 for this to not matter.

Still, be consistent and use unsigned integers.

Similar use unsinged integers when checking for overflows in the
relocation entry processing.

I've also added a new subtests to igt/gem_reloc_overflow to also
test for overflowing args->buffer_count values.

v2: Give the variables again tighter scope to make it clear that the
computation is purely local and doesn't leak out to the 2nd block.
