ARM: S3C24XX: Fix possible dma selection warning

Currently the s3c sound support selects CONFIG_S3C2410_DMA on s3c24xx
architectures while the generic dma config is enabled by CONFIG_S3C24XX_DMA.

With the way the Kconfig options are layed out currently it is possible
to enable Samsung sound support without enabling the necessary dma support
resulting in warnings like
  warning: (SND_SOC_SAMSUNG && SND_S3C24XX_I2S && SND_S3C2412_SOC_I2S &&
       SND_SOC_SAMSUNG_SMDK2443_WM9710 && SND_SOC_SAMSUNG_LN2440SBC_ALC650)
  selects S3C2410_DMA which has unmet direct dependencies (ARCH_S3C24XX &&
       S3C24XX_DMA && (CPU_S3C2410 || CPU_S3C2442))

Therefore bring the s3c2410 dma support in line with the way the other
s3c24xx SoCs handle this by having the SoC dma-support selected if the generic
s3c dma support is enabled and have the sound support depend on S3C24XX_DMA
on these arches. The s3c2442 is using the same dma descriptors and therefore
also selected S3C2410_DMA.
