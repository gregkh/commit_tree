iio: iio_push_to_buffers(): Change type of 'data' to const void *

Change the type of the 'data' parameter for iio_push_to_buffers() from 'u8 *' to
'const void *'. Drivers typically use the correct type (e.g. __be16 *) for their
data buffer. When passing the buffer to iio_push_to_buffers() it needs to be
cast to 'u8 *' for the compiler to not complain (and also having to add __force
if we want to keep sparse happy as well). Since the buffer implementation should
not care about the data layout (except the size of one sample) using a void
pointer is the correct thing to do. Also make it const as the buffer
implementations are not supposed to modify it.
