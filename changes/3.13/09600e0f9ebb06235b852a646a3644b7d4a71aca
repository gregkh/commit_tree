perf tools: Compare dso's also when comparing symbols

Linus reported that sometimes 'perf report -s symbol' exits without any
message on TUI.  David and Jiri found that it's because it failed to add
a hist entry due to an invalid symbol length.

It turns out that sorting by symbol (address) was broken since it only
compares symbol addresses.  The symbol address is a relative address
within a dso thus just checking its address can result in merging
unrelated symbols together.  Fix it by checking dso before comparing
symbol address.
