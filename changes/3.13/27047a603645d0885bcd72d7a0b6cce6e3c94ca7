cpufreq: Add new helper cpufreq_table_validate_and_show()

Almost every cpufreq driver is required to validate its frequency table with:
cpufreq_frequency_table_cpuinfo() and then expose it to cpufreq core with:
cpufreq_frequency_table_get_attr().

This patch creates another helper routine cpufreq_table_validate_and_show() that
will do both these steps in a single call and will return 0 for success, error
otherwise.

This also fixes potential bugs in cpufreq drivers where people have called
cpufreq_frequency_table_get_attr() before calling
cpufreq_frequency_table_cpuinfo(), as the later may fail.
