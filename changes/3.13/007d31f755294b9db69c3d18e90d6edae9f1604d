Btrfs: check file extent type before anything else

I hit this problem with my no holes patch and it made me realize what the
problem was for bz 60834.  If the first item in the leaf is an inline extent and
we try to read anything starting from disk_bytenr onward we will read off the
end of the leaf.  So we need to check to see what it's type is, and if it's not
REG we can just break out.  This should fix this problem.  Thanks,
