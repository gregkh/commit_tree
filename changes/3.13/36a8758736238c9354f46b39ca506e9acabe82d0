USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-spear suspend

Suspend scenario in case of ohci-spear glue was not
properly handled as it was not suspending generic part
of ohci controller.  Alan Stern suggested, properly handle
ohci-spear suspend scenario.

Calling explicitly the ohci_suspend() routine in
spear_ohci_hcd_drv_suspend() will ensure proper
handling of suspend scenario.
