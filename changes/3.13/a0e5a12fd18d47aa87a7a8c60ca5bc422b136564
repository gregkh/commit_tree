drivers/memstick/core/ms_block.c: fix unreachable state in h_msb_read_page()

In h_msb_read_page() in ms_block.c, flow never reaches case
MSB_RP_RECIVE_STATUS_REG.  This causes error when MEMSTICK_INT_ERR is
encountered and status error bits are going to be examined, but the status
will never be copied back.

Fix it by transitioning to MSB_RP_RECIVE_STATUS_REG right after
MSB_RP_SEND_READ_STATUS_REG.
