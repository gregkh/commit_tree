KVM: Improve create VCPU parameter (CVE-2013-4587)

In multiple functions the vcpu_id is used as an offset into a bitfield.  Ag
malicious user could specify a vcpu_id greater than 255 in order to set or
clear bits in kernel memory.  This could be used to elevate priveges in the
kernel.  This patch verifies that the vcpu_id provided is less than 255.
The api documentation already specifies that the vcpu_id must be less than
max_vcpus, but this is currently not checked.
