gpiolib: fix find_chip_by_name()

find_chip_by_name() was incorrectly implemented by using
gpio_lookup_list instead of gpiod_chips to iterate through all the
registered GPIO controllers. This patch reimplements it by using
gpiochip_find() with a custom search function, which simplifies the code
on top of fixing the mistake.
