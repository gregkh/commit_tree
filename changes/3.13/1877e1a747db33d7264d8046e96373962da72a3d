btrfs: remove move_pages()

move_pages() has an inefficient backwards byte copy of regions of two
different pages.  They're different pages so the regions won't overlap
and it could use memcpy().

At that point, though, move_pages() would be a slightly dimmer
re-implementation of copy_pages() that lacked the test for overlapping
page regions.

So remove move_pages() and just call copy_pages().
