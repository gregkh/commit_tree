usb: phy: am335x: add wakeup support

This is based on George Cherian's patch which added power & wakeup
support to am335x and does no longer apply since I took some if the code
apart in favor of the multi instance support.
This compiles and I boots and later it detects a device after I plug it in :)
Could somebody please test it so it does what it should?
