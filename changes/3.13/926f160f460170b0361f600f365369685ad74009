powerpc: Little endian builds double word swap VSX state during context save/restore

The elements within VSX loads and stores are big endian ordered
regardless of endianness. Our VSX context save/restore code uses
lxvd2x and stxvd2x which is a 2x doubleword operation. This means
the two doublewords will be swapped and we have to perform another
swap to undo it.

We need to do this on save and restore.
