mmap: arch_get_unmapped_area(): use proper mmap base for bottom up direction

This is more or less the generic variant of commit 41aacc1eea64 ("x86
get_unmapped_area: Access mmap_legacy_base through mm_struct member").

So effectively architectures which use an own arch_pick_mmap_layout()
implementation but call the generic arch_get_unmapped_area() now can
also randomize their mmap_base.

All architectures which have an own arch_pick_mmap_layout() and call the
generic arch_get_unmapped_area() (arm64, s390, tile) currently set
mmap_base to TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE.  This is also true for the generic
arch_pick_mmap_layout() function.  So this change is a no-op currently.
