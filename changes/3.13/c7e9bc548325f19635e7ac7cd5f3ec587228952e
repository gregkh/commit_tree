arm/xen: get_dma_ops: return xen_dma_ops if we are running as xen_initial_domain

We can't simply override arm_dma_ops with xen_dma_ops because devices
are allowed to have their own dma_ops and they take precedence over
arm_dma_ops. When running on Xen as initial domain, we always want
xen_dma_ops to be the one in use.

We introduce __generic_dma_ops to allow xen_dma_ops functions to call
back to the native implementation.

Changes in v7:
- return xen_dma_ops only if we are the initial domain;
- rename __get_dma_ops to __generic_dma_ops.
