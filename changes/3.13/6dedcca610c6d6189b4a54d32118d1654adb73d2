hotplug, powerpc, x86: Remove cpu_hotplug_driver_lock()

cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() serializes CPU online/offline operations
when ARCH_CPU_PROBE_RELEASE is set.  This lock interface is no longer
necessary with the following reason:

 - lock_device_hotplug() now protects CPU online/offline operations,
   including the probe & release interfaces enabled by
   ARCH_CPU_PROBE_RELEASE.  The use of cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() is
   redundant.
 - cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() is only valid when ARCH_CPU_PROBE_RELEASE
   is defined, which is misleading and is only enabled on powerpc.

This patch removes the cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() interface.  As
a result, ARCH_CPU_PROBE_RELEASE only enables / disables the cpu
probe & release interface as intended.  There is no functional change
in this patch.
