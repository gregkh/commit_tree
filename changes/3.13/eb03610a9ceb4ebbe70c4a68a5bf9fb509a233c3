iio: Correct description how to convert microtesla to gauss

this just fixes the comment; however, I'm not sure if the driver reports
measurements correctly; the raw values are 0.3 uT / LSB; IIO is supposed
to report magnetic fields in Gauss, so the scale should be around 1/300
(ignoring ASA) -- but value and scale are returned as VAL_INT
