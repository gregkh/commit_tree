efi: Add proper definitions for some EFI function pointers.

The x86/AMD64 EFI stubs must use a call wrapper to convert between
the Linux and EFI ABIs, so void pointers are sufficient.  For ARM,
the ABIs are compatible, so we can directly invoke the function
pointers.  The functions that are used by the ARM stub are updated
to match the EFI definitions.
Also add some EFI types used by EFI functions.
