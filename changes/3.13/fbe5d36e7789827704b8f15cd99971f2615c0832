drm/i915/bdw: Support BDW caching

BDW caching works differently than the previous generations. Instead of
having bits in the PTE which directly control how the page is cached,
the 3 PTE bits PWT PCD and PAT provide an index into a PAT defined by
register 0x40e0. This style of caching is functionally equivalent to how
it works on HSW and before.

v2: Tiny bikeshed as discussed on internal irc.

v3: Squash in patch from Ville to mirror the x86 PAT setup more like
in arch/x86/mm/pat.c. Primarily, the 0th index will be WB, and not
uncached.

v4: Comment for reason to not use a 64b write on the PPAT.

v5: Add a FIXME comment that the caching bits in the PAT registers
might be wrong due to doc confusion.
