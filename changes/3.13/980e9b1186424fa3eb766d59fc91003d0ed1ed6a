i40e: Add support for 64 bit netstats

This change brings support for 64 bit netstats to the driver. Previously
the stats were 64 bit but highly racy due to the fact that 64 bit
transactions are not atomic on 32 bit systems.  This change makes is so
that the 64 bit byte and packet stats are reliable on all architectures.
