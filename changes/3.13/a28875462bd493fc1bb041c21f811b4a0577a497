ARM: imx6: report soc info via soc device

The patch enables soc bus infrastructure and adds a function
imx_soc_device_init() to report soc info via soc device interface for
imx6qdl and imx6sl.  With the support, user space can get soc related
info by looking at sysfs like below.

  $ cat /sys/devices/soc0/machine
  Freescale i.MX6 Quad SABRE Smart Device Board
  $ cat /sys/devices/soc0/family
  Freescale i.MX
  $ cat /sys/devices/soc0/soc_id
  i.MX6Q
  $ cat /sys/devices/soc0/revision
