tracing: Do not use signed enums with unsigned long long in fgragh output

The duration field of print_graph_duration() can also be used
to do the space filling by passing an enum in it:

  DURATION_FILL_FULL
  DURATION_FILL_START
  DURATION_FILL_END

The problem is that these are enums and defined as negative,
but the duration field is unsigned long long. Most archs are
fine with this but blackfin fails to compile because of it:

kernel/built-in.o: In function `print_graph_duration':
kernel/trace/trace_functions_graph.c:782: undefined reference to `__ucmpdi2'

Overloading a unsigned long long with an signed enum is just
bad in principle. We can accomplish the same thing by using
part of the flags field instead.
