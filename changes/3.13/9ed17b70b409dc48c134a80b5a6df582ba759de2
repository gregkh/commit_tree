random: statically compute poolbitshift, poolbytes, poolbits

Use a macro to statically compute poolbitshift (will be used in a
subsequent patch), poolbytes, and poolbits.  On virtually all
architectures the cost of a memory load with an offset is the same as
the one of a memory load.

It is still possible for this to generate worse code since the C
compiler doesn't know the fixed relationship between these fields, but
that is somewhat unlikely.
