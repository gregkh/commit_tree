fcoe: make sure fcoe frames are unshared prior to manipulating them

Based on my last patch I noticed that fcoe_rcv has a simmilar problem, in that
it manipulates the passed in skb without checking to see if it has other users.
Making manipulations to a shared skb can result in various corruptions.

Easy fix, just make sure the skb is unshared prior to doing anything with it.
