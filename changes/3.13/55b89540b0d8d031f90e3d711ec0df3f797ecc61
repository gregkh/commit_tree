arm64: compat: correct register concatenation for syscall wrappers

The arm64 port contains wrappers for arm32 syscalls that pass 64-bit
values. These wrappers concatenate the two registers to hold a 64-bit
value in a single X register. On BE, however, the lower and higher
words are swapped.

Create a new assembler macro, regs_to_64, that when on BE systems
swaps the registers in the orr instruction.
