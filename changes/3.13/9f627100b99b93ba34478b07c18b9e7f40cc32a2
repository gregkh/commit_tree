staging: rtl8192u: copy dot11d.h in ieee80211/dot11d.h and remove it

This patch copies the content of dot11d.h into ieee80211/dot11d.h and then
removes it because practically the two header files are the same with the
difference that in dot11d.h some checkpatch warnings have been corrected.
This is done because the duplication of dot11d.h is unnecessary since the
structures and functions that defines are used directly only inside ieee80211/.
