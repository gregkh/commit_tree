ALSA: compress: Fix 64bit ABI incompatibility

snd_pcm_uframes_t is defined as unsigned long so it would take
different sizes depending on 32 or 64bit architectures.  As we don't
want this ABI incompatibility, and there is no real 64bit user yet,
let's make it the fixed size with __u32.

Also bump the protocol version number to 0.1.2.
