sched/wait: Clean up wait.h details a bit

Since we are changing wait.h profoundly, use the opportunity to:

 - add a sentence to explain what this file is about
 - remove whitespace noise
 - prettify weird looking line break fixup attempts
 - standardize type definition and initialization sequences
 - use consistent style details

No code is changed.
