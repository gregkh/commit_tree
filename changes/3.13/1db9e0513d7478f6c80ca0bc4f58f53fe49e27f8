s390: allow to set gcc -mtune flag

Add a new Kconfig choice group which allows to configure how gcc should
tune the generated code (via -mtune option).
By default the -mtune parameter will match the -march parameter.

This is a rather large patch, but I wouldn't know how to make this shorter
unfortunately.
