kfifo API type safety

This patch enhances the type safety for the kfifo API.  It is now safe
to put const data into a non const FIFO and the API will now generate a
compiler warning when reading from the fifo where the destination
address is pointing to a const variable.

As a side effect the kfifo_put() does now expect the value of an element
instead a pointer to the element.  This was suggested Russell King.  It
make the handling of the kfifo_put easier since there is no need to
create a helper variable for getting the address of a pointer or to pass
integers of different sizes.

IMHO the API break is okay, since there are currently only six users of
kfifo_put().

The code is also cleaner by kicking out the "if (0)" expressions.
