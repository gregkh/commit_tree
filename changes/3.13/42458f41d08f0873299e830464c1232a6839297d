n_tty: Ensure reader restarts worker for next reader

A departing reader must restart a flush_to_ldisc() worker _before_
the next reader enters the read loop; this is to avoid the new reader
concluding no more i/o is available and prematurely exiting, when the
old reader simply hasn't re-started the worker yet.
