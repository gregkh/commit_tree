ARM: kirkwood: retain MAC address for DT ethernet

Ethernet IP on Kirkwood SoCs loose their MAC address register content
if clock gated. To allow modular ethernet driver setups and gated clocks
also on non-DT capable bootloaders, we fixup port device nodes with no
valid MAC address property. This patch copies MAC address register
contents set up by bootloaders early, notably before ethernet clocks
are gated. While at it, also reorder call sequence in _dt_init.
