sched: Fix race on toggling cfs_bandwidth_used

When we transition cfs_bandwidth_used to false, any currently
throttled groups will incorrectly return false from cfs_rq_throttled.
While tg_set_cfs_bandwidth will unthrottle them eventually, currently
running code (including at least dequeue_task_fair and
distribute_cfs_runtime) will cause errors.

Fix this by turning off cfs_bandwidth_used only after unthrottling all
cfs_rqs.

Tested: toggle bandwidth back and forth on a loaded cgroup. Caused
crashes in minutes without the patch, hasn't crashed with it.
