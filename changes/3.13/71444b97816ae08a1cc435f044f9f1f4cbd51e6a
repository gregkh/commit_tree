IB/srp: Add change_queue_depth and change_queue_type support

Currently, it's not possible to change queue depth for a device behind
SRP host. Sometimes, we need to adjust queue_depth for performance
reason (eg storage busy, we need lower queue_depth to avoid running
into SCSI error handler), so this patch add support for SRP driver.
