perf: Factor out strncpy() in perf_event_mmap_event()

While this is really minor, but strncpy() does the unnecessary
zero-padding till the end of tmp[16] and it is called every time
we are going to use the string literal.

Turn these strncpy()'s into the single strlcpy() under the new
label, saves 72 bytes.
