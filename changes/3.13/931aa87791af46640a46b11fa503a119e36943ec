Btrfs: fix list delete warning when removing ordered root from the list

Commit b02441999efcc6152b87cd58e7970bb7843f76cf "Btrfs: don't wait for
the completion of all the ordered extents" introduced a bug that broke
the ordered root list:
 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7119 at lib/list_debug.c:59 __list_del_entry+0x5a/0x98()

It is because we forgot to return the roots in the splice list to the
ordered list of the fs. Fix it.
