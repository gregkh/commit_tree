net_sched: act: Dont increment refcnt on replace

 This is a bug fix. The existing code tries to kill many
 birds with one stone: Handling binding of actions to
 filters, new actions and replacing of action
 attributes. A simple test case to illustrate:

XXXX
 moja@fe1:~$ sudo tc actions add action drop index 12
 moja@fe1:~$ actions get action gact index 12
 action order 1: gact action drop
  random type none pass val 0
  index 12 ref 1 bind 0
 moja@fe1:~$ sudo tc actions replace action ok index 12
 moja@fe1:~$ actions get action gact index 12
 action order 1: gact action drop
  random type none pass val 0
  index 12 ref 2 bind 0
XXXX

The above shows the refcounf being wrongly incremented on replace.
There are more complex scenarios with binding of actions to filters
that i am leaving out that didnt work as well...
