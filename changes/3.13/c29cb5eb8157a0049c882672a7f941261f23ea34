ALSA: hda - Add Dell headset detection quirk for three laptop models

On the Dell machines with codec whose Subsystem Id is 0x10280610,
0x10280629 or 0x1028063e, no external microphone can be detected when
plugging a 3-ring headset. If we add "model=dell-headset-multi" for
the snd-hda-intel.ko, the problem will disappear.

The codecs on these machines belong to alc_269 family.
