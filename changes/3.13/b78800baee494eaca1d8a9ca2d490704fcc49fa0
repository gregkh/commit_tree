Revert "nfsd: remove_stid can be incorporated into nfs4_put_delegation"

This reverts commit 7ebe40f20372688a627ad6c754bc0d1c05df58a9.  We forgot
the nfs4_put_delegation call in fs/nfsd/nfs4callback.c which should not
be unhashing the stateid.  This lead to warnings from the idr code when
we tried to removed id's twice.
