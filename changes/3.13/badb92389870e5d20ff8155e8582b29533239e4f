rename ARCH_BCM to ARCH_BCM_MOBILE (mach-bcm)

Currently ARCH_BCM has been used for Broadcom
Mobile V7 based SoCs. In order to allow other Broadcom
SoCs to also use mach-bcm directory and files, this patch
renames the original ARCH_BCM to ARCH_BCM_MOBILE, and
uses ARCH_BCM to define any Broadcom chip residing
in mach-bcm directory.
