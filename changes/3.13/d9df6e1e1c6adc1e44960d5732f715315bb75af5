ARM: OMAP2+: AM43x: PRCM kbuild

Build AM43x power domain, clock domain and hwmod data.

Many of AM43x IP's and interconnects are similar as that in AM335x,
hence AM335x hwmod data is being reused with necessary changes.

Earlier the plan was to reuse AM335x specific PRCM code, but as AM43x
PRCM register layout is much similar to OMAP4/5, AM335x PRCM is
divorced and instead married with OMAP4/5 PRCM for AM43x.
