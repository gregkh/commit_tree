gpio: twl4030: Fix regression for twl gpio output

Commit c111feabe2e2 (gpio: twl4030: Cache the direction and output
states in private data) improved things in general, but caused a
regression for setting the GPIO output direction.

The change reorganized twl_direction_out() and twl_set() and swapped
the function names around in the process. While doing that, a bug got
introduced that's not obvious while reading the patch as it appears
as no change to the code.

The bug is we now call function twl4030_set_gpio_dataout() twice in
both twl_direction_out() and twl_set(). Instead, we should first
call twl_direction_out() in twl_direction_out() followed by
twl4030_set_gpio_dataout() in twl_set().

This regression probably has gone unnoticed for a long time as the
bootloader may have set the GPIO direction properly in many cases.
This fixes at least the LCD panel not turning on omap3 LDP for
example.
