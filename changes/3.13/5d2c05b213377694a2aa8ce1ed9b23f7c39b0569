batman-adv: add per VLAN interface attribute framework

Since batman-adv is now fully VLAN-aware, a proper framework
able to handle per-vlan-interface attributes is needed.

Those attributes will affect the associated VLAN interface
only, rather than the real soft_iface (which would result
in every vlan interface having the same attribute
configuration).

To make the code simpler and easier to extend, attributes
associated to the standalone soft_iface are now treated
like belonging to yet another vlan having a special vid.
This vid is different from the others because it is made up
by all zeros and the VLAN_HAS_TAG bit is not set.
