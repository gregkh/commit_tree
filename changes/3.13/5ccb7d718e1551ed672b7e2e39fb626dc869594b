drivers/rtc/rtc-s5m.c: fix info->rtc assignment

Fix this warning:

  drivers/rtc/rtc-s5m.c: In function `s5m_rtc_probe':
  drivers/rtc/rtc-s5m.c:545: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type

struct s5m_rtc_info.rtc has type "struct regmap *", while
struct sec_pmic_dev.rtc has type "struct i2c_client *".

Probably the author wanted to assign "struct sec_pmic_dev.regmap", which
has the correct type.

Also, as "rtc" doesn't make much sense as a name for a regmap, rename it
to "regmap".
