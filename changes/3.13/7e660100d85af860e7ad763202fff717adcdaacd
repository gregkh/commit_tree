[SCSI] Derive the FLUSH_TIMEOUT from the basic I/O timeout

Rather than having a separate constant for specifying the timeout on FLUSH
operations, use the basic I/O timeout value that is already configurable
on a per target basis to derive the FLUSH timeout. Looking at the current
definitions of these timeout values, the FLUSH operation is supposed to have
a value that is twice the normal timeout value. This patch preserves this
relationship while leveraging the flexibility of specifying the I/O timeout.
