PCI: Workaround missing pci_set_master in pci drivers

Ben Herrenschmidt found that commit 928bea964827 ("PCI: Delay enabling
bridges until they're needed") breaks PCI in some powerpc environments.

The reason is that the PCIe port driver will call pci_enable_device() on
the bridge, so the device is enabled, but skips pci_set_master because
pcie_port_auto and no acpi on powerpc.

Because of that, pci_enable_bridge() later on (called as a result of the
child device driver doing pci_enable_device) will see the bridge as
already enabled and will not call pci_set_master() on it.

Fixed by add checking in pci_enable_bridge, and call pci_set_master
if driver skip that.

That will make the code more robot and wade off problem for missing
pci_set_master in drivers.
