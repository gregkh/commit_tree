arm64: module: ensure instruction is little-endian before manipulation

Relocations that require an instruction immediate to be re-encoded must
ensure that the instruction pattern is represented in a little-endian
format for the manipulation code to work correctly.

This patch converts the loaded instruction into native-endianess prior
to encoding and then converts back to little-endian byteorder before
updating memory.
