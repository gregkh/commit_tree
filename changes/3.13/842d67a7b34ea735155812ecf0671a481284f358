net: expose the master link to sysfs, and remove it from bond

Currently, we can have only one master upper neighbour, so it would be
useful to create a symlink to it in the sysfs device directory, the way
that bonding now does it, for every device. Lower devices from
bridge/team/etc will automagically get it, so we could rely on it.

Also, remove the same functionality from bonding.
