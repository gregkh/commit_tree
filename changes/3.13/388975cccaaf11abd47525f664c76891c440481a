sysfs: clean up sysfs_get_dirent()

The pre-existing sysfs interfaces which take explicit namespace
argument are weird in that they place the optional @ns in front of
@name which is contrary to the established convention.  For example,
we end up forcing vast majority of sysfs_get_dirent() users to do
sysfs_get_dirent(parent, NULL, name), which is silly and error-prone
especially as @ns and @name may be interchanged without causing
compilation warning.

This renames sysfs_get_dirent() to sysfs_get_dirent_ns() and swap the
positions of @name and @ns, and sysfs_get_dirent() is now a wrapper
around sysfs_get_dirent_ns().  This makes confusions a lot less
likely.

There are other interfaces which take @ns before @name.  They'll be
updated by following patches.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.

v2: EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() wasn't updated leading to undefined symbol
    error on module builds.  Reported by build test robot.  Fixed.
