drm/i915: Clarify VLV PLL p1 limits

For some reason there's a sort of off by one issue with the p1 divider.
The actual p1 limits according to
VLV2_DPLL_mphy_hsdpll_frequency_table_ww6_rev1p1.xlsm is 2-3, so we should
just say that instead of saying 1-3 and avoiding the 1 via the choice of
comparison operator.

I don't know why we're using different p1 limits for intel_limits_vlv_dac
and intel_limits_vlv_hdmi, but let's preserve that for now.
