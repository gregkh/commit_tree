Btrfs: avoid heavy operations in btrfs_commit_super

The 'git blame' history shows that, the old transaction commit code has to do
twice to ensure roots are updated and we have to flush metadata and super block
manually, however, right now all of these can be handled well inside
the transaction commit code without extra efforts.

And the error handling part remains same with the current code, -- 'return to
caller once we get error'.

This saves us a transaction commit and a flush of super block, which are both
heavy operations according to ftrace output analysis.
