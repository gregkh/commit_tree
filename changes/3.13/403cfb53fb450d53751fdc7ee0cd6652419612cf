HID: hid-elo: some systems cannot stomach work around

Some systems although they have firmware class 'M', which usually
needs a work around to not crash, must not be subjected to the
work around because the work around crashes them. They cannot be
told apart by their own device descriptor, but as they are part
of compound devices, can be identified by looking at their siblings.
