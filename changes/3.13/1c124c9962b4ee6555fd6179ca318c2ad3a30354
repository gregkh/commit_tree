USB: UHCI: check for wakeup/suspend race

hcd-pci.c in usbcore contains a check for wakeup requests racing with
controller suspend.  This check is going to be moved out of usbcore
and into the individual controller drivers, where it can apply to all
platforms, not just PCI.

This patch adds the check to uhci-hcd.  Ironically, none of the
non-PCI platform drivers for uhci-hcd implement suspend/resume.
Nevertheless, this change is needed to accomodate the upcoming change
to usbcore.

The patch also removes an outdated check of the root hub state.  For
one thing, the PM layer has long been quite reliable about suspending
root hubs before controllers.  For another, virtually the same check
is also made in hcd-pci.c; there's no point in repeating it.
