GFS2: Introduce rbm field bii

This is a respin of the original patch. As Steve pointed out, the
introduction of field bii makes it easy to eliminate bi itself.
This revised patch does just that, replacing bi with bii.

This patch adds a new field to the rbm structure, called bii,
which is an index into the array of bitmaps for an rgrp.
This replaces *bi which was a pointer to the bitmap.
This is being done for further optimizations.
