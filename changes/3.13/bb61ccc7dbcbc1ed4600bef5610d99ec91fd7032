x86/cpu: Allow higher NR_CPUS values

The current range for SMP configs is 2 - 512 CPUs, or a full
4096 in the case of MAXSMP.  There are machines that have 1024
CPUs in them today and configuring a kernel for that means you
are forced to set MAXSMP.  This adds additional unnecessary
overhead.  While that overhead might be considered tiny for
large machines, it isn't necessarily so if you are building a
kernel that runs across a wide variety of machines.

To cover the range of more common machines today, we allow
NR_CPUS to be up to 4096 when CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is enabled.
