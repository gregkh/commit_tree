ACPI / hotplug: Merge device hot-removal routines

There is no real reasn why acpi_bus_device_eject() and
acpi_bus_hot_remove_device() should work differently, so rework
acpi_bus_device_eject() so that it can be called internally by
both acpi_bus_hot_remove_device() and acpi_eject_store_work().
Accordingly, rework acpi_hotplug_notify_cb() to queue up the
execution of acpi_bus_hot_remove_device() through
acpi_os_hotplug_execute() on eject request notifications.
