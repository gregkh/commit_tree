gpiolib: add gpiod_get() and gpiod_put() functions

Add gpiod_get(), gpiod_get_index() and gpiod_put() functions that
provide safer management of GPIOs.

These functions put the GPIO framework in line with the conventions of
other frameworks in the kernel, and help ensure every GPIO is declared
properly and valid while it is used.
