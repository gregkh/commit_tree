Bluetooth: Add management command for setting static address

On dual-mode BR/EDR/LE and LE only controllers it is possible
to configure a random address. There are two types or random
addresses, one is static and the other private. Since the
random private addresses require special privacy feature to
be supported, the configuration of these two are kept separate.

This command allows for setting the static random address. It is
only supported on controllers with LE support. The static random
address is suppose to be valid for the lifetime of the controller
or at least until the next power cycle. To ensure such behavior,
setting of the address is limited to when the controller is
powered off.

The special BDADDR_ANY address (00:00:00:00:00:00) can be used to
disable the static address. This is also the default value.
