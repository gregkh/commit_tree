mmc: core: Prevent violation of specs while initializing cards

According to eMMC/SD/SDIO specs, the VDD (VCC) voltage level must be
maintained during the initialization sequence. If we want/need to tune
the voltage level, a complete power cycle of the card must be executed.

Most host drivers conforms to the specifications by only allowing to
change VDD voltage level at the MMC_POWER_UP state, but some also cares
about MMC_POWER_ON state, which they should'nt. This patch will not
break those drivers, but they could clean up code to better reflect
what is expected from the protocol layer.

A big re-work of the mmc_select_voltage function is done to only change
VDD voltage level if the host supports MMC_CAP2_FULL_PWR_CYCLE.
Otherwise only validation of the host and card ocr mask will be done.

A very nice side-effect of this patch is that we now don't need to
reset the negotiated ocr mask at the mmc_power_off function, since now
it will actually reflect the present voltage level, which safely can be
used at the next power up and re-initialization. Moreover, we then only
need to execute mmc_select_voltage from the attach sequence.
