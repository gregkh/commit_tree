perf symbols: Validate kcore module addresses

Before using kcore we need to check that modules are in memory at the
same addresses that they were when data was recorded.

This is done because, while we could remap symbols to different
addresses, the object code linkages would still be different which would
provide an erroneous view of the object code.
