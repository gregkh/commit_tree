mm: numa: return the number of base pages altered by protection changes

Commit 0255d4918480 ("mm: Account for a THP NUMA hinting update as one
PTE update") was added to account for the number of PTE updates when
marking pages prot_numa.  task_numa_work was using the old return value
to track how much address space had been updated.  Altering the return
value causes the scanner to do more work than it is configured or
documented to in a single unit of work.

This patch reverts that commit and accounts for the number of THP
updates separately in vmstat.  It is up to the administrator to
interpret the pair of values correctly.  This is a straight-forward
operation and likely to only be of interest when actively debugging NUMA
balancing problems.

The impact of this patch is that the NUMA PTE scanner will scan slower
when THP is enabled and workloads may converge slower as a result.  On
the flip size system CPU usage should be lower than recent tests
reported.  This is an illustrative example of a short single JVM specjbb
test

Performance is similar but note the reduction in system CPU time.  While
this showed a performance gain, it will not be universal but at least
it'll be behaving as documented.  The vmstats are obviously different but
here is an obvious interpretation of them from mmtests.

"NUMA page range updates" == nr_pte_updates and is the value returned to
the NUMA pte scanner.  NUMA huge PMD updates were the number of THP
updates which in combination can be used to calculate how many ptes were
updated from userspace.
