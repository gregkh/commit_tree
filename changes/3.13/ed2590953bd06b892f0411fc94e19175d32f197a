Btrfs: stop using vfs_read in send

Apparently we don't actually close the files until we return to userspace, so
stop using vfs_read in send.  This is actually better for us since we can avoid
all the extra logic of holding the file we're sending open and making sure to
clean it up.  This will fix people who have been hitting too many files open
errors when trying to send.  Thanks,
