of: Make cpu node handling more portable.

Use for_each_node_by_type() to iterate all cpu nodes in the
system.

Provide and overridable function arch_find_n_match_cpu_physical_id,
which sees if the given device node matches 'cpu' and if so sets
'*thread' when non-NULL to the cpu thread number within the core.

The default implementation behaves the same as the existing code.

Add a sparc64 implementation.
