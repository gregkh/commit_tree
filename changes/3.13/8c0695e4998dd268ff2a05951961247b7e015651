NFC Digital: Add NFC-F technology support

This adds polling support for NFC-F technology at 212 kbits/s and 424
kbits/s. A user space application like neard can send type 3 tag
commands through the NFC core.

Process flow for NFC-F detection is as follow:

1 - The digital stack sends the SENSF_REQ command to the NFC device.
2 - A peer device replies with a SENSF_RES response.
3   - The digital stack notifies the NFC core of the presence of a
      target in the operation field and passes the target NFCID2.

This also adds support for CRC calculation of type CRC-F. The CRC
calculation is handled by the digital stack if the NFC device doesn't
support it.
