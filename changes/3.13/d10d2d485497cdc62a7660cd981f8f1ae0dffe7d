ARM: fix ARCH_IXP4xx usage of ARCH_SUPPORTS_BIG_ENDIAN

The Kconfig for arch/arm/mach-ixp4xx has a local definition
of ARCH_SUPPORTS_BIG_ENDIAN which could be used elsewhere.
This means that if IXP4xx is selected and this symbol is
selected eleswhere then an warning is produced.

Clean the following error up by making the symbol be
selected by the main ARCH_IXP4XX definition and have a
common definition in arch/arm/mm/Kconfig

warning: (ARCH_xxx) selects ARCH_SUPPORTS_BIG_ENDIAN which has unmet direct dependencies (ARCH_IXP4XX)
warning: (ARCH_xxx) selects ARCH_SUPPORTS_BIG_ENDIAN which has unmet direct dependencies (ARCH_IXP4XX)
