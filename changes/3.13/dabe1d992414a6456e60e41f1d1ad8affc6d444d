sched/numa: Be more careful about joining numa groups

Due to the way the pid is truncated, and tasks are moved between
CPUs by the scheduler, it is possible for the current task_numa_fault
to group together tasks that do not actually share memory together.

This patch adds a few easy sanity checks to task_numa_fault, joining
tasks together if they share the same tsk->mm, or if the fault was on
a page with an elevated mapcount, in a shared VMA.
