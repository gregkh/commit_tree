cpufreq: define generic .attr, .exit() and .verify() routines

Most of the CPUFreq drivers do similar things in .exit() and .verify() routines
and .attr. So its better if we have generic routines for them which can be used
by cpufreq drivers then.

This patch introduces generic .attr, .exit() and .verify() cpufreq drivers.
