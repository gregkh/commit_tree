usbcore: fix incorrect type in assignment in usb_set_lpm_parameters()

In the bos usb_ss_cap_descriptor structure, bU2DevExitLat is of type __le16.
This value is used as it is, without being first converted to the CPU
byteorder, for the setup of usb device's usb3_lpm_parameters.
This patch fixes that by converting bU2DevExitLat field to the CPU byteorder
before the assignmenment to [udev/hub]_u2_del variables.
