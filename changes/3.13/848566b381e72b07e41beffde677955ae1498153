Bluetooth: Provide high speed configuration option

Hiding the Bluetooth high speed support behind a module parameter is
not really useful. This can be enabled and disabled at runtime via
the management interface. This also has the advantage that this can
now be changed per controller and not just global.

This patch removes the module parameter and exposes the high speed
setting of the management interface to all controllers.
