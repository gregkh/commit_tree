xhci: Limit the spurious wakeup fix only to HP machines

We've got regression reports that my previous fix for spurious wakeups
after S5 on HP Haswell machines leads to the automatic reboot at
shutdown on some machines.  It turned out that the fix for one side
triggers another BIOS bug in other side.  So, it's exclusive.

Since the original S5 wakeups have been confirmed only on HP machines,
it'd be safer to apply it only to limited machines.  As a wild guess,
limiting to machines with HP PCI SSID should suffice.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.12, that
contain the commit 638298dc66ea36623dbc2757a24fc2c4ab41b016 "xhci: Fix
spurious wakeups after S5 on Haswell".
