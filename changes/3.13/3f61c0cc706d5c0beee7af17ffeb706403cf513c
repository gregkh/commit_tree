ext4: add prototypes for macro-generated functions

It isn't very easy to find the declarations for the functions created
by EXT4_INODE_BIT_FNS() because the names are generated by macros:

    ext4_test_inode_flag, ext4_set_inode_flag, ext4_clear_inode_flag
    ext4_test_inode_state, ext4_set_inode_state, ext4_clear_inode_state

Add explicit declarations for these functions so that grep and tags
can find them.
