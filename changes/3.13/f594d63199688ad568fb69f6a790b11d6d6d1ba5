tcp_memcontrol: Remove setting cgroup settings via sysctl

The code is broken and does not constrain sysctl_tcp_mem as
tcp_update_limit does.  With the result that it allows the cgroup tcp
memory limits to be bypassed.

The semantics are broken as the settings are not per netns and are in a
per netns table, and instead looks at current.

Since the code is broken in both design and implementation and does not
implement the functionality for which it was written remove it.
