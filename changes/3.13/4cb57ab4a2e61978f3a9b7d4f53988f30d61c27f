dm bufio: initialize read-only module parameters

Some module parameters in dm-bufio are read-only. These parameters
inform the user about memory consumption. They are not supposed to be
changed by the user.

However, despite being read-only, these parameters can be set on
modprobe or insmod command line, for example:
modprobe dm-bufio current_allocated_bytes=12345

The kernel doesn't expect that these variables can be non-zero at module
initialization and if the user sets them, it results in BUG.

This patch initializes the variables in the module init routine, so that
user-supplied values are ignored.
