ixgbevf: add wait for Rx queue disable

New function was added to wait for Rx queues to be disabled before
disabling NAPI. This function also allows us to  modify
ixgbevf_rx_desc_queue_enable() to better match ixgbe.  I also cleaned up
some msleep calls to usleep_range while I was in this code anyway.
