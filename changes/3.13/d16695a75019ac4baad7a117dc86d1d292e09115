      dmaengine: remove DMA unmap from drivers

which had the side-effect of not unmapping the self-test mappings.
Fix this by using dmaengine_unmap_data in the self-test routines.

In addition, since dmaengine_unmap() assumes that all mappings were created
with dma_map_page, this commit changes the single mapping to a page mapping
to avoid an incorrect unmapping of the memcpy self-test.

The allocation could be changed to be alloc_page(), but sticking to kmalloc
results in a less intrusive patch. The size of the test buffer is increased,
since dma_map_page() seem to fail when the source and destination pages are
the same page.
