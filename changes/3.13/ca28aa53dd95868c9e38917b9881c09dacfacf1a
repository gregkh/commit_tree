sched/numa: Fix task or group comparison

This patch separately considers task and group affinities when
searching for swap candidates during NUMA placement. If tasks
are part of the same group, or no group at all, the task weights
are considered.

Some hysteresis is added to prevent tasks within one group from
getting bounced between NUMA nodes due to tiny differences.

If tasks are part of different groups, the code compares group
weights, in order to favor grouping task groups together.

The patch also changes the group weight multiplier to be the
same as the task weight multiplier, since the two are no longer
added up like before.
