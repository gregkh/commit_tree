rcu: Micro-optimize rcu_cpu_has_callbacks()

The for_each_rcu_flavor() loop unconditionally scans all flavors, even
when the first flavor might have some non-lazy callbacks.  Once the
loop has seen a non-lazy callback, further passes through the loop
cannot change the state.  This is not a huge problem, given that there
can be at most three RCU flavors (RCU-bh, RCU-preempt, and RCU-sched),
but this code is on the path to idle, so speeding it up even a small
amount would have some benefit.

This commit therefore does two things:

1.	Rearranges the order of the list of RCU flavors in order to
	place the most active flavor first in the list.  The most active
	RCU flavor is RCU-preempt, or, if there is no RCU-preempt,
	RCU-sched.

2.	Reworks the for_each_rcu_flavor() to exit early when the first
	non-lazy callback is seen, or, in the case where the caller
	does not care about non-lazy callbacks (RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=n),
	when the first callback is seen.
