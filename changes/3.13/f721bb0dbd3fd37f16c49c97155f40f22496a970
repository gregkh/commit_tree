skd: Fix checkpatch ERRORS and removed unused functions

This patch fixes checkpatch.pl errors for assignment in if condition.
It also removes unused readq / readl function calls.

As Andrew had disabled the compilation of drivers for 32 bit,
I have modified format specifiers in few VPRINTKs to avoid warnings
during 64 bit compilation.
