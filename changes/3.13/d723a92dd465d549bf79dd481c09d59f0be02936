sysfs/bin: Fix size handling overflow for bin_attribute

While looking at the code, I noticed that bin_attribute read() and write()
ops copy the inode size into an int for futher comparisons.

Some bin_attributes can be fairly large. For example, pci creates some for
BARs set to the BAR size and giant BARs are around the corner, so this is
going to break something somewhere eventually.

Let's use the right type.

[adjust for seqfile conversions, only needed for bin_read() - gkh]
