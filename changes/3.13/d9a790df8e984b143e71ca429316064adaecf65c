ARM: 7883/1: fix mov to mvn conversion in case of 64 bit phys_addr_t and BE

Fix patching code to convert mov instruction into mvn instruction
in case of CONFIG_ARCH_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT and CONFIG_ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT.

In BE case store into r0 proper bits so byte swapped instruction
could be modified correctly.
