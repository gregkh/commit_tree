i2c: rcar: use per-device clock

Using the same clock for all device instances is non-portable and obtaining
clock references by an ID without using a device pointer is discouraged.
This is also not needed, because on platforms, where this driver is used,
suitable clocks are available for the I2C controllers, that are children of
the peripheral clock and just pass its rate 1-to-1 to controllers. This
patch switches the driver to obtain references to correct clocks.
