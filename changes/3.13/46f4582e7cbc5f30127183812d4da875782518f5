efi: Generalize handle_ramdisks() and rename to handle_cmdline_files().

The handle_cmdline_files now takes the option to handle as a string,
and returns the loaded data through parameters, rather than taking
an x86 specific setup_header structure.  For ARM, this will be used
to load a device tree blob in addition to initrd images.
