KVM: Add documentation for KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET ioctl

To implement CPU=Host we have added KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET
vm ioctl which provides information to user space required for
creating VCPU matching underlying Host.

This patch adds info related to this new KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET
vm ioctl in the KVM API documentation.
