USB: see if URB comes from a completion handler

Now that URBs can be completed inside tasklets, we need a way of
determining whether a completion handler for a given endpoint is
currently running.  Otherwise it's not possible to maintain the API
guarantee about keeping isochronous streams synchronous when an
underrun occurs.

This patch adds a field and a routine to check whether a completion
handler for a periodic endpoint is running.  At the moment no
analogous routine appears to be necessary for async endpoints, but one
can always be added.
