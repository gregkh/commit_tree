bcache: Insert multiple keys at a time

We'll often end up with a list of adjacent keys to insert -
because bch_data_insert() may have to fragment the data it writes.

Originally, to simplify things and avoid having to deal with corner
cases bch_btree_insert() would pass keys from this list one at a time to
btree_insert_recurse() - mainly because the list of keys might span leaf
nodes, so it was easier this way.

With the btree_insert_node() refactoring, it's now a lot easier to just
pass down the whole list and have btree_insert_recurse() iterate over
leaf nodes until it's done.
