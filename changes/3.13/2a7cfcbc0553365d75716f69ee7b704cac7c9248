ARM: 7923/1: mm: fix dcache flush logic for compound high pages

When given a compound high page, __flush_dcache_page will only flush
the first page of the compound page repeatedly rather than the entire
set of constituent pages.

This error was introduced by:
   0b19f93 ARM: mm: Add support for flushing HugeTLB pages.

This patch corrects the logic such that all constituent pages are now
flushed.
