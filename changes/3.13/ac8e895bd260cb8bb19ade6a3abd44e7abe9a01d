sched/numa: Add infrastructure for split shared/private accounting of NUMA hinting faults

Ideally it would be possible to distinguish between NUMA hinting faults
that are private to a task and those that are shared.  This patch prepares
infrastructure for separately accounting shared and private faults by
allocating the necessary buffers and passing in relevant information. For
now, all faults are treated as private and detection will be introduced
later.
