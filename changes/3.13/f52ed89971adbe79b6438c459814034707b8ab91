pkt_sched: fq: fix pacing for small frames

For performance reasons, sch_fq tried hard to not setup timers for every
sent packet, using a quantum based heuristic : A delay is setup only if
the flow exhausted its credit.

Problem is that application limited flows can refill their credit
for every queued packet, and they can evade pacing.

This problem can also be triggered when TCP flows use small MSS values,
as TSO auto sizing builds packets that are smaller than the default fq
quantum (3028 bytes)

This patch adds a 40 ms delay to guard flow credit refill.
