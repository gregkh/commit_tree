ath10k: drop the fw versioning sanity check

It was corrupted and leading to compilation warning
core.c: In function 'ath10k_check_fw_version':
core.c:79: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type

Since we are going to support new FW track in the driver,
the sanity check for fw version number would be an overkill
then. This is just for information purposes anyway.
