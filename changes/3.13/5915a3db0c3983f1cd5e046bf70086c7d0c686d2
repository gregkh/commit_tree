backlight: introduce backlight_device_registered

Introduce a new API for modules to query if a specific type of backlight
device has been registered. This is useful for some backlight device
provider module (e.g. ACPI video) to know if a native control
interface(e.g. the interface created by i915) is available and then do
things accordingly (e.g. avoid registering its own on Win8 systems).
