drm/i915: implement the Haswell mode set sequence workaround

This workaround is described in the mode set sequence documentation.
When enabling planes for the second pipe, we need to wait for 2
vblanks on the first pipe. This should solve "a flash of screen
corruption if planes are enabled on second/third pipe during the time
that big FIFO mode is exiting". Watermarks are fun :)

v2: Save indentation levels
