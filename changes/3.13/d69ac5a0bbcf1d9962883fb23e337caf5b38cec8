sysfs: remove sysfs_addrm_cxt->parent_sd

sysfs_addrm_start/finish() enclose sysfs_dirent additions and
deletions and sysfs_addrm_cxt is used to record information necessary
to finish the operations.  Currently, sysfs_addrm_start() takes
@parent_sd, records it in sysfs_addrm_cxt, and assumes that all
operations in the block are performed under that @parent_sd.

This assumption has been fine until now but we want to make some
operations behave recursively and, while having @parent_sd recorded in
sysfs_addrm_cxt doesn't necessarily prevents that, it becomes
confusing.

This patch removes sysfs_addrm_cxt->parent_sd and makes
sysfs_add_one() take an explicit @parent_sd parameter.  Note that
sysfs_remove_one() doesn't need the extra argument as its parent is
always known from the target @sd.

While at it, add __acquires/releases() notations to
sysfs_addrm_start/finish() respectively.

This patch doesn't make any functional difference.
