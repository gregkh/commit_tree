xhci: refactor TRB_CONFIG_EP case into function

The function that handles xHCI command completion is much too long and
there is need to be broken up into individual functions for each command
completion to improve code readablity.
This patch refactors the code in TRB_CONFIG_EP switch case, in
handle_cmd_completion(), into a fuction named xhci_handle_cmd_config_ep().

There were added two additional variables, 'add_flags' and 'drop_flags',
to reduce line length below 80 chars and improve code readability.
