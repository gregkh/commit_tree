qlcnic: Skip unknown entry type while collecting firmware dump

o Driver aborts the minidump collection operation when it finds
  an unknown entry opcode. This patch skips unknown entry type
  and resumes the minidump collection operation.
o Removed a comparision of collected dump size with expected dump size.
  Size may differ when driver decides to skip an entry.
