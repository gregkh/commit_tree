ACPIPHP / radeon / nouveau: Fix VGA switcheroo problem related to hotplug

The changes in the ACPI-based PCI hotplug (ACPIPHP) subsystem made
during the 3.12 development cycle uncovered a problem with VGA
switcheroo that on some systems, when the device-specific method
(ATPX in the radeon case, _DSM in the nouveau case) is used to turn
off the discrete graphics, the BIOS generates ACPI hotplug events for
that device and those events cause ACPIPHP to attempt to remove the
device from the system (they are events for a device that was present
previously and is not present any more, so that's what should be done
according to the spec).  Then, the system stops functioning correctly.

Since the hotplug events in question were simply silently ignored
previously, the least intrusive way to address that problem is to
make ACPIPHP ignore them again.  For this purpose, introduce a new
ACPI device flag, no_hotplug, and modify ACPIPHP to ignore hotplug
events for PCI devices whose ACPI companions have that flag set.
Next, make the radeon and nouveau switcheroo detection code set the
no_hotplug flag for the discrete graphics' ACPI companion.
