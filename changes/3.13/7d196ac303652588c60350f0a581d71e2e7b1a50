lkdtm: adjust recursion size to avoid warnings

When CONFIG_FRAME_WARN is set low (e.g. some ARM builds), the hard-coded
stack buffer size used for kernel stack over run testing triggers build
warnings. Instead, avoid the warning by recalcuating the buffer size and
recursion count needed to trigger the test. Also uses the recursion counter
indirectly to avoid changing the parameter during the test.
