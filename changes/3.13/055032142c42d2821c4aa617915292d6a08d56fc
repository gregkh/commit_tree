ALSA: Add SoC on-chip internal ram support for DMA buffer allocation

Now it's quite common that an SoC contains its on-chip internal RAM.
By using this RAM space for DMA buffer during audio playback/record,
we can shutdown the voltage for external RAM to save power.

So add new DEV type with iram malloc()/free() and accordingly modify
current default mmap() for the iram circumstance.
