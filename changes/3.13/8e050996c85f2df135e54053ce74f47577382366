iio: Update buffer's bytes per datum after updating the scan mask

Currently a IIO device driver needs to make sure to update the buffer's bytes
per datum after the scan mask has changed. This is usually done in the preenable
callback by invoking iio_sw_buffer_preenable(). This is something that needs to
be done and is done for virtually all devices which support buffers (we
currently have only one exception). Also this a bit of a layering violation
since we have to call the buffer setup ops from the device setup ops. This
requires the device driver to know about the internal requirements of the buffer
(e.g. whether we need to call the set_bytes_per_datum) callback. And especially
with in-kernel buffer consumers, which allows to attach arbitrary buffers to a
device, this is something that the driver can't know.

Moving this to the core allows us to drop the individual calls to
iio_sw_buffer_preenable() from drivers.
