KVM: ARM: Support hugetlbfs backed huge pages

Support huge pages in KVM/ARM and KVM/ARM64.  The pud_huge checking on
the unmap path may feel a bit silly as the pud_huge check is always
defined to false, but the compiler should be smart about this.

Note: This deals only with VMAs marked as huge which are allocated by
users through hugetlbfs only.  Transparent huge pages can only be
detected by looking at the underlying pages (or the page tables
themselves) and this patch so far simply maps these on a page-by-page
level in the Stage-2 page tables.
