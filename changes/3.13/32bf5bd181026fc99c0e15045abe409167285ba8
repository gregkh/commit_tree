perf bench: Fix two warnings

There are two warnings in bench/numa, when building this on 32-bit
machine.

The warning output is attached:

bench/numa.c:1113:20: error: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Werror=sign-compare]
bench/numa.c:1161:6: error: format ‘%lx’ expects argument of t'long unsigned int’, but argument 5 has type ‘u64’ [-Werror=format]

This patch fixes these two warnings.
