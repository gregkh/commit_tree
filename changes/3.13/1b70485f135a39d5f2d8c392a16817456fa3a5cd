ALSA: firewire: extend snd_fw_transaction()

Add a flag to snd_fw_transaction() to allow it to abort when a bus reset
happens.  This removes most of the duplicated error handling loops that
were required around calls to the low-level fw_run_transaction().

Also add a flag to suppress error messages; errors are expected when we
attempt to clean up after the device was unplugged.
