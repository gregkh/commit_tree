Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-da8xx suspend"

This reverts commit 86a63f10211ba7d249763bbe10b52073273affa8.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
