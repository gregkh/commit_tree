extcon: arizona: Clear trig_sts bits on all paths

We want the trig_sts bits to be cleared in all cases where we consider
the jack detection interrupt to have been handled. Specifically, if a
duplicate detection event was suppressed these bits were not cleared
causing the CODEC to not enter a low power state. This patch clears the
bits on the duplicate detection code path.
