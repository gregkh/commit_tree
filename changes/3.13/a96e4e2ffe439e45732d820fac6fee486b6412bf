IB/uverbs: New macro to set pointers to NULL if length is 0 in INIT_UDATA()

Trying to have a ternary operator to choose between NULL (or 0) and the
real pointer value in invocations leads to an impossible choice between
a sparse error about a literal 0 used as a NULL pointer, and a gcc
warning about "pointer/integer type mismatch in conditional expression."

Rather than clutter the source with more casts, move the ternary
operator into a new INIT_UDATA_BUF_OR_NULL() macro, which makes it
easier to use and simplifies its callers.
