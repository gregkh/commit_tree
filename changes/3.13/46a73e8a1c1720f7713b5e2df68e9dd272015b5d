sched/numa: Fix NULL pointer dereference in task_numa_migrate()

The cpusets code can split up the scheduler's domain tree into
smaller domains.  Some of those smaller domains may not cross
NUMA nodes at all, leading to a NULL pointer dereference on the
per-cpu sd_numa pointer.

Tasks cannot be migrated out of their domain, so the patch
also sets p->numa_preferred_nid to whereever they are, to
prevent the migration from being retried over and over again.
