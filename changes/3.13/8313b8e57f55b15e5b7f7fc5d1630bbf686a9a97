md: fix problem when adding device to read-only array with bitmap.

If an array is started degraded, and then the missing device
is found it can be re-added and a minimal bitmap-based recovery
will bring it fully up-to-date.

If the array is read-only a recovery would not be allowed.
But also if the array is read-only and the missing device was
present very recently, then there could be no need for any
recovery at all, so we simply include the device in the read-only
array without any recovery.

However... if the missing device was removed a little longer ago
it could be missing some updates, but if a bitmap is present it will
be conditionally accepted pending a bitmap-based update.  We don't
currently detect this case properly and will include that old
device into the read-only array with no recovery even though it really
needs a recovery.

This patch keeps track of whether a bitmap-based-recovery is really
needed or not in the new Bitmap_sync rdev flag.  If that is set,
then the device will not be added to a read-only array.
