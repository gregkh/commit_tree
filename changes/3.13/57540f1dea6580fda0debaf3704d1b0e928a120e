kconfig: adjust warning message for conflicting types

Each symbol must have exactly one type assigned. However, if a symbol happens
to have two different types assigned at runtime, a warning is printed and the
first type is preserved while the second type is being ignored.

The warning message says

type of <symbol name> redefined from <first type> to <second type>

which may be misleading as it may create the impression that the second type
replaces the first type.

This patch clarifies this by changing the warning to

ignoring type redefinition of <symbol name> from <first type> to <second type>
