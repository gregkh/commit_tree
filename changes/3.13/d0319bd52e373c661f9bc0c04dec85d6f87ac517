mm: remove bogus warning in copy_huge_pmd()

Sasha Levin reported the following warning being triggered

  WARNING: CPU: 28 PID: 35287 at mm/huge_memory.c:887 copy_huge_pmd+0x145/ 0x3a0()
  Call Trace:
    copy_huge_pmd+0x145/0x3a0
    copy_page_range+0x3f2/0x560
    dup_mmap+0x2c9/0x3d0

This warning was introduced by "mm: numa: Avoid unnecessary disruption
of NUMA hinting during migration" for paranoia reasons but the warning
is bogus.  I was thinking of parallel races between NUMA hinting faults
and forks but this warning would also be triggered by a parallel reclaim
splitting a THP during a fork.  Remote the bogus warning.
