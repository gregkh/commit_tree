staging: comedi: ni_6527: remove COMEDI_MITE dependancy

The COMEDI_MITE driver is a wrapper for the National Instruments
PCI MITE ASIC. This driver includes the PCI boilerplate used to
remap the resources as well as the support code for bus mastered
DMA.

The ni_6527 does not support DMA and the COMEDI_MITE driver adds
unnecessary complexity.

Remove the need for the COMEDI_MITE driver by handling the ioremap
directly in the (*attach). Store the ioremap'ed address in the
private data.
