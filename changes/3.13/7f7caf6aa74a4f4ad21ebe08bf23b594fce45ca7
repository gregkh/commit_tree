target: Pass through I/O topology for block backstores

In addition to block size (already implemented), passing through
alignment offset, logical-to-phys block exponent, I/O granularity and
optimal I/O length will allow initiators to properly handle layout on
LUNs with 4K block sizes.

Tested with various weird values via scsi_debug module.

One thing to look at with this patch is the new block limits values --
instead of granularity 1 optimal 8192, Lio will now be returning whatever
the block device says, which may affect performance.
