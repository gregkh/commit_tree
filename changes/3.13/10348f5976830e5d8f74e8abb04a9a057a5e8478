powerpc: Check return value of instance-to-package OF call

On PA-Semi firmware, the instance-to-package callback doesn't seem
to be implemented. We didn't check for error, however, thus
subsequently passed the -1 value returned into stdout_node to
thins like prom_getprop etc...

Thus caused the firmware to load values around 0 (physical) internally
as node structures. It somewhat "worked" as long as we had a NULL in the
right place (address 8) at the beginning of the kernel, we didn't "see"
the bug. But commit 5c0484e25ec03243d4c2f2d4416d4a13efc77f6a
"powerpc: Endian safe trampoline" changed the kernel entry point causing
that old bug to now cause a crash early during boot.

This fixes booting on PA-Semi board by properly checking the return
value from instance-to-package.
