ima: extend the measurement list to include the file signature

This patch defines a new template called 'ima-sig', which includes
the file signature in the template data, in addition to the file's
digest and pathname.

A template is composed of a set of fields.  Associated with each
field is an initialization and display function.  This patch defines
a new template field called 'sig', the initialization function
ima_eventsig_init(), and the display function ima_show_template_sig().

This patch modifies the .field_init() function definition to include
the 'security.ima' extended attribute and length.

Changelog:
- remove unused code (Dmitry Kasatkin)
- avoid calling ima_write_template_field_data() unnecesarily (Roberto Sassu)
- rename DATA_FMT_SIG to DATA_FMT_HEX
- cleanup ima_eventsig_init() based on Roberto's comments
