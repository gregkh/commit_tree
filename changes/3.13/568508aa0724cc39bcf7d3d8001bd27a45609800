genetlink: unify registration functions

Now that the ops assignment is just two variables rather than a
long list iteration etc., there's no reason to separately export
__genl_register_family() and __genl_register_family_with_ops().

Unify the two functions into __genl_register_family() and make
genl_register_family_with_ops() call it after assigning the ops.
