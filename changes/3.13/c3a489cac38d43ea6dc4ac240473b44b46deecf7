mm: numa: ensure anon_vma is locked to prevent parallel THP splits

The anon_vma lock prevents parallel THP splits and any associated
complexity that arises when handling splits during THP migration.  This
patch checks if the lock was successfully acquired and bails from THP
migration if it failed for any reason.
