Btrfs: don't wait for the completion of all the ordered extents

It is very likely that there are lots of ordered extents in the filesytem,
if we wait for the completion of all of them when we want to reclaim some
space for the metadata space reservation, we would be blocked for a long
time. The performance would drop down suddenly for a long time.
