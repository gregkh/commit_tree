vlan: unlink the upper neighbour before unregistering

On netdev unregister we're removing also all of its sysfs-associated stuff,
including the sysfs symlinks that are controlled by netdev neighbour code.
Also, it's a subtle race condition - cause we can still access it after
unregistering.

Move the unlinking right before the unregistering to fix both.
