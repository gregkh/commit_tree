ACPICA: Update namespace dump code.

This patch merges namespace dump code updates from ACPICA upstream to
reduce the source code differences between Linux and ACPICA upstream.  No
functional changes as currently nsdumpdv.c is not used by Linux.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux kernel binary.
