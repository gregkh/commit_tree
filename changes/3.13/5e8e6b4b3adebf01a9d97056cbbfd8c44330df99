iscsi-target: Fix mutex_trylock usage in iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn

This patch fixes a >= v3.10 regression bug with mutex_trylock() usage
within iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn(), that was originally added to allow
for a special case where ->cmdsn_mutex was already held from the
iscsit_execute_cmd() exception path for ib_isert.

When !mutex_trylock() was occuring under contention during normal RX/TX
process context codepaths, the bug was manifesting itself as the following
protocol error:

  Received CmdSN: 0x000fcbb7 is greater than MaxCmdSN: 0x000fcbb6, protocol error.
  Received CmdSN: 0x000fcbb8 is greater than MaxCmdSN: 0x000fcbb6, protocol error.

This patch simply avoids the direct ib_isert callback in lio_queue_status()
for the special iscsi_execute_cmd() exception cases, that allows the problematic
mutex_trylock() usage in iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn() to go away.
