tools lib traceevent: Handle __print_hex(__get_dynamic_array(fieldname), len)

The kernel has a few events with a format similar to this excerpt:
        field:unsigned int len;     offset:12;      size:4; signed:0;
        field:__data_loc unsigned char[] data_array;  offset:16;      size:4; signed:0;
print fmt: "%s", __print_hex(__get_dynamic_array(data_array), REC->len)

trace-cmd could already parse that arg correctly, but print_str_arg()
was unable to handle the first parameter being a dynamic array. (It
just printed a "field not found" warning).

Teach print_str_arg's PRINT_HEX case to handle the nested
PRINT_DYNAMIC_ARRAY correctly. The output now matches the kernel's own
formatting for this case.
