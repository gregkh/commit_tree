net: skb_checksum: allow custom update/combine for walking skb

Currently, skb_checksum walks over 1) linearized, 2) frags[], and
3) frag_list data and calculats the one's complement, a 32 bit
result suitable for feeding into itself or csum_tcpudp_magic(),
but unsuitable for SCTP as we're calculating CRC32c there.

Hence, in order to not re-implement the very same function in
SCTP (and maybe other protocols) over and over again, use an
update() + combine() callback internally to allow for walking
over the skb with different algorithms.
