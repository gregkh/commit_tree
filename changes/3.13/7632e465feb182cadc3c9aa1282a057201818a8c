dcache: use IS_ROOT to decide where dentry is hashed

Every hashed dentry is either hashed in the dentry_hashtable, or a
superblock's s_anon list.

__d_drop() assumes it can determine which is the case by checking
DCACHE_DISCONNECTED; this is not true.

It is true that when DCACHE_DISCONNECTED is cleared, the dentry is not
only hashed on dentry_hashtable, but is fully connected to its parents
back to the root.

But the converse is *not* true: fs/exportfs/expfs.c:reconnect_path()
attempts to connect a directory (found by filehandle lookup) back to
root by ascending to parents and performing lookups one at a time.  It
does not clear DCACHE_DISCONNECTED until it's done, and that is not at
all an atomic process.

In particular, it is possible for DCACHE_DISCONNECTED to be set on a
dentry which is hashed on the dentry_hashtable.

Instead, use IS_ROOT() to check which hash chain a dentry is on.  This
*does* work:

Dentries are hashed only by:

	- d_obtain_alias, which adds an IS_ROOT() dentry to sb_anon.

	- __d_rehash, called by _d_rehash: hashes to the dentry's
	  parent, and all callers of _d_rehash appear to have d_parent
	  set to a "real" parent.
	- __d_rehash, called by __d_move: rehashes the moved dentry to
	  hash chain determined by target, and assigns target's d_parent
	  to its d_parent, before dropping the dentry's d_lock.

Therefore I believe it's safe for a holder of a dentry's d_lock to
assume that it is hashed on sb_anon if and only if IS_ROOT(dentry) is
true.

I believe the incorrect assumption about DCACHE_DISCONNECTED was
originally introduced by ceb5bdc2d246 "fs: dcache per-bucket dcache hash
locking".

Also add a comment while we're here.
