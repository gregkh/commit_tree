GFS2: Fix incorrect invalidation for DIO/buffered I/O

In patch 209806aba9d540dde3db0a5ce72307f85f33468f we allowed
local deferred locks to be granted against a cached exclusive
lock. That opened up a corner case which this patch now
fixes.

The solution to the problem is to check whether we have cached
pages each time we do direct I/O and if so to unmap, flush
and invalidate those pages. Since the glock state machine
normally does that for us, mostly the code will be a no-op.
