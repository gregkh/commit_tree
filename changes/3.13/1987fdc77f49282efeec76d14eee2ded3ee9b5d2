Bluetooth: Make Set Connectable also update the LE advertising type

This patch updates the Set Connectable Management command to also update
the LE advertising type to either connectable or non-connectable
advertising. An extra helper function is needed for getting the right
advertising type since we can not only rely on the HCI_CONNECTABLE flag
but must also check for a pending Set Connectable command (in which case
the flag does not yet have its final value).
