ipc,shm: fix shm_file deletion races

When IPC_RMID races with other shm operations there's potential for
use-after-free of the shm object's associated file (shm_file).

Here's the race before this patch:

  TASK 1                     TASK 2
  ------                     ------
  shm_rmid()
    ipc_lock_object()
                             shmctl()
                             shp = shm_obtain_object_check()

    shm_destroy()
      shum_unlock()
      fput(shp->shm_file)
                             ipc_lock_object()
                             shmem_lock(shp->shm_file)
                             <OOPS>

The oops is caused because shm_destroy() calls fput() after dropping the
ipc_lock.  fput() clears the file's f_inode, f_path.dentry, and
f_path.mnt, which causes various NULL pointer references in task 2.  I
reliably see the oops in task 2 if with shmlock, shmu

This patch fixes the races by:
1) set shm_file=NULL in shm_destroy() while holding ipc_object_lock().
2) modify at risk operations to check shm_file while holding
   ipc_object_lock().

Example workloads, which each trigger oops...

Workload 1:
  while true; do
    id=$(shmget 1 4096)
    shm_rmid $id &
    shmlock $id &
    wait
  done

  The oops stack shows accessing NULL f_inode due to racing fput:
    _raw_spin_lock
    shmem_lock
    SyS_shmctl

Workload 2:
  while true; do
    id=$(shmget 1 4096)
    shmat $id 4096 &
    shm_rmid $id &
    wait
  done

  The oops stack is similar to workload 1 due to NULL f_inode:
    touch_atime
    shmem_mmap
    shm_mmap
    mmap_region
    do_mmap_pgoff
    do_shmat
    SyS_shmat

Workload 3:
  while true; do
    id=$(shmget 1 4096)
    shmlock $id
    shm_rmid $id &
    shmunlock $id &
    wait
  done

  The oops stack shows second fput tripping on an NULL f_inode.  The
  first fput() completed via from shm_destroy(), but a racing thread did
  a get_file() and queued this fput():
    locks_remove_flock
    __fput
    ____fput
    task_work_run
    do_notify_resume
    int_signal
