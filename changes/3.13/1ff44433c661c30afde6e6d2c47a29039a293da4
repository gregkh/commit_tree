ARM: 7834/1: mmc: mmci: Save and restore register context

If a corresponding power domain exists for the device and it manages
to cut the domain regulator while the device is runtime suspended,
the IP loses it's registers context. We restore the context in the
.runtime_resume callback from the existing register caches to adapt
to this situation.

We also want to make sure the registers are in a known state while
restoring context in the case when the power domain did not drop the
power, since there are restrictions for the order of writing to these
registers. To handle this, we clear the registers in the
.runtime_suspend callback.
