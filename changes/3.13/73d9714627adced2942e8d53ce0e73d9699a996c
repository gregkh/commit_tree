sysfs: copy bin mmap support from fs/sysfs/bin.c to fs/sysfs/file.c

sysfs bin file handling will be merged into the regular file support.
This patch copies mmap support from bin so that fs/sysfs/file.c can
handle mmapping bin files.

The code is copied mostly verbatim with the following updates.

* ->mmapped and ->vm_ops are added to sysfs_open_file and bin_buffer
  references are replaced with sysfs_open_file ones.

* Symbols are prefixed with sysfs_.

* sysfs_unmap_bin_file() grabs sysfs_open_dirent and traverses
  ->files.  Invocation of this function is added to
  sysfs_addrm_finish().

* sysfs_bin_mmap() is added to sysfs_bin_operations.

This is a preparation and the new mmap path isn't used yet.
