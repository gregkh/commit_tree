PCI: mvebu: make local functions static

mvebu_pcie_add_bus(), mvebu_pcie_align_resource()  are used only
in this file. Thus, these local functions should be staticized
in order to fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c:684:6: warning: symbol 'mvebu_pcie_add_bus' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c:690:17: warning: symbol 'mvebu_pcie_align_resource' was not declared. Should it be static?
