ARM: tegra: remove much of iomap.h

iomap.h defines the base address of Tegra peripherals. Most of this
information comes from device tree now, and hence can be deleted.
Entries are kept for various system peripherals that low-level code
(such as initial boot, system suspend/resume, debug) still requires.

Removing the values removes the temptation for someone to use them.
