ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: Fix coherent DMA mask

Commit 4dcfa60071b3d23f0181f27d8519f12e37cefbb9 ("ARM: DMA-API: better
handing of DMA masks for coherent allocations") added an additional
check to the coherent DMA mask that results in an error when the mask is
larger than what dma_addr_t can address.

Set the LCDC coherent DMA mask to DMA_BIT_MASK(32) instead of ~0 to fix
the problem.
