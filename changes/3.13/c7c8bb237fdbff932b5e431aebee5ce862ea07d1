ima: provide support for arbitrary hash algorithms

In preparation of supporting more hash algorithms with larger hash sizes
needed for signature verification, this patch replaces the 20 byte sized
digest, with a more flexible structure.  The new structure includes the
hash algorithm, digest size, and digest.

Changelog:
- recalculate filedata hash for the measurement list, if the signature
  hash digest size is greater than 20 bytes.
- use generic HASH_ALGO_
- make ima_calc_file_hash static
- scripts lindent and checkpatch fixes
