ext4: remove unreachable code in ext4_can_extents_be_merged()

Commit ec22ba8e ("ext4: disable merging of uninitialized extents")
ensured that if either extent under consideration is uninit, we
decline to merge, and immediately return.

But right after that test, we test again for an uninit
extent; we can never hit this.  So just remove the impossible
test and associated variable.
