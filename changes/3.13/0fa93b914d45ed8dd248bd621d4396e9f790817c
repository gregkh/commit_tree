ARM: S3C24XX: number the dma clocks

Each dma channel has its own clock. The upcoming dma driver wants to
handle these itself and therefore needs to be able to get the correct
clock for a channel.

Therefore rename the dma clocks to "dma.X" for s3c2412, s3c2416 and
s3c2443. This does not change the behaviour for the old dma driver at
all, as all dma clocks are still always on and not handled by the old
dma driver at all.
