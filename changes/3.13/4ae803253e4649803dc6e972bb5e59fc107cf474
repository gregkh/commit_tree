s390/bitops: optimize set_bit() for constant values

Since zEC12 we have the interlocked-access facility 2 which allows to
use the instructions ni/oi/xi to update a single byte in storage with
compare-and-swap semantics.
So change set_bit(), clear_bit() and change_bit() to generate such code
instead of a compare-and-swap loop (or using the load-and-* instruction
family), if possible.
This reduces the text segment by yet another 8KB (defconfig).

Alternatively the long displacement variants niy/oiy/xiy could have
been used, but the extended displacement field is usually not needed
and therefore would only increase the size of the text segment again.
