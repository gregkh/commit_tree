blk-mq: remove newly added instances of __cpuinit

The new blk-mq code added new instances of __cpuinit usage.
We removed this a couple versions ago; we now want to remove
the compat no-op stubs.  Introducing new users is not what
we want to see at this point in time, as it will break once
the stubs are gone.
