Input: ti_am335x_tsc - fix spelling mistake in TSC/ADC DT binding

There was a spelling mistake on TSC/ADC binding where "coordinate" was
spelled as "coordiante".

We can't simply fix the error due to DT being an ABI, the approach taken
was to first use correct spelling and if that fails, fall back to
miss-spelled version.

It's unfortunate that has creeped into the tree.
