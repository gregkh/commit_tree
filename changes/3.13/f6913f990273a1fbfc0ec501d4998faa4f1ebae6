hotplug / x86: Fix online state in cpu0 debug interface

_debug_hotplug_cpu() is a debug interface that puts cpu0 offline during
boot-up when CONFIG_DEBUG_HOTPLUG_CPU0 is set.  After cpu0 is put offline
in this interface, however, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online still
shows 1 (online).

This patch fixes _debug_hotplug_cpu() to update dev->offline when CPU
online/offline operation succeeded.
