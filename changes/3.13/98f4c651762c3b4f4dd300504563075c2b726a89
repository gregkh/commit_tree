hv: move ringbuffer bus attributes to dev_groups

This moves the ringbuffer bus attributes to the dev_groups structure,
deletes the now unneeded struct hv_device_info, and removes some now
unused functions, and variables as everything is now moved to the
dev_groups structure, dev_attrs is no longer needed.
