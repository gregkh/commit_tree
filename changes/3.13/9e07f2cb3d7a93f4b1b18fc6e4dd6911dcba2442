GFS2: Speed up starting point selection for block allocation

When setting the starting point for block allocation, there were calls
to both gfs2_rbm_to_block() and gfs2_rbm_from_block() in the common case
of there being an active reservation. The gfs2_rbm_from_block() function
can be quite slow, and since the two conversions were effectively a
no-op, it makes sense to avoid them entirely in this case.

There is no functional change here, but the code should be a bit more
efficient after this patch.
