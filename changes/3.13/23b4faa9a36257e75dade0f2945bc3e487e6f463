gpio: bcm281xx: Don't print addresses of GPIO area in probe()

The physical address of the GPIO memory address is already printed
implicitly by dev_info() as part of the device name. The virtual
address doesn't add any value. In addition, printing a resource_size_t
with %x lead to a compiler warning on some platforms.
