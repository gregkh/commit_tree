x86/efi: Fix earlyprintk off-by-one bug

Dave reported seeing the following incorrect output on his Thinkpad T420
when using earlyprintk=efi,

[    0.000000] efi: EFI v2.00 by Lenovo
                    ACPI=0xdabfe000  ACPI 2.0=0xdabfe014 SMBIOS=0xdaa9e000

The output should be on one line, not split over two. The cause is an
off-by-one error when checking that the efi_y coordinate hasn't been
incremented out of bounds.
