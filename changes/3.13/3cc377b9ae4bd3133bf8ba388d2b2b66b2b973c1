dmaengine: fix enable for high order unmap pools

The higher order mempools support raid operations, and we want to
disable them when raid support is not enabled.  Making them conditional
on ASYNC_TX_DMA is not sufficient as other users (specifically dmatest)
will also issue raid operations.  Make raid drivers explicitly request
that the core carry the higher order pools.
