md: test mddev->flags more safely in md_check_recovery.

commit 7a0a5355cbc71efa md: Don't test all of mddev->flags at once.
made most tests on mddev->flags safer, but missed one.

When
commit 260fa034ef7a4ff8b7306 md: avoid deadlock when dirty buffers during md_stop.
added MD_STILL_CLOSED, this caused md_check_recovery to misbehave.
It can think there is something to do but find nothing.  This can
lead to the md thread spinning during array shutdown.
