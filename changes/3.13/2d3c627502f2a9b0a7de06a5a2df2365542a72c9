Revert "init/Kconfig: add option to disable kernel compression"

This reverts commit 69f0554ec261fd686ac7fa1c598cc9eb27b83a80.

This patch breaks randconfig on at least the x86-64 architecture, and
most likely on others.  There is work underway to support uncompressed
kernels in a generic way, but it looks like it will amount to
rewriting the support from scratch; see the LKML thread in the Link:
for info.

Therefore, revert this change and wait for the fix.
