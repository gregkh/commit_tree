dm stats: initialize read-only module parameter

The module parameter stats_current_allocated_bytes in dm-mod is
read-only.  This parameter informs the user about memory
consumption.  It is not supposed to be changed by the user.

However, despite being read-only, this parameter can be set on
modprobe or insmod command line:
modprobe dm-mod stats_current_allocated_bytes=12345

The kernel doesn't expect that this variable can be non-zero at module
initialization and if the user sets it, it results in warning.

This patch initializes the variable in the module init routine, so
that user-supplied value is ignored.
