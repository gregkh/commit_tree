random: convert DEBUG_ENT to tracepoints

Instead of using the random driver's ad-hoc DEBUG_ENT() mechanism, use
tracepoints instead.  This allows for a much more fine-grained control
of which debugging mechanism which a developer might need, and unifies
the debugging messages with all of the existing tracepoints.
