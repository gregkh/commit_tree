wlcore: fwlog dynamic mem_block control

number of fwlog mem_blocks can be configured using module param.
this is a fw debug feature: in case a large fw log data is busrted during
a short period of time, the memory get filled and data is lost.
this allows us to dynamicly set the fw log mem_block usage, although
configuring more mem_block for logger comes at the expense of TP.
