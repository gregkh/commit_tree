x86/dumpstack: Fix printk_address for direct addresses

Consider a kernel crash in a module, simulated the following way:

 static int my_init(void)
 {
         char *map = (void *)0x5;
         *map = 3;
         return 0;
 }
 module_init(my_init);

When we turn off FRAME_POINTERs, the very first instruction in
that function causes a BUG. The problem is that we print IP in
the BUG report using %pB (from printk_address). And %pB
decrements the pointer by one to fix printing addresses of
functions with tail calls.

This was added in commit 71f9e59800e5ad4 ("x86, dumpstack: Use
%pB format specifier for stack trace") to fix the call stack
printouts.

So instead of correct output:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000005
  IP: [<ffffffffa01ac000>] my_init+0x0/0x10 [pb173]

We get:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000005
  IP: [<ffffffffa0152000>] 0xffffffffa0151fff

To fix that, we use %pS only for stack addresses printouts (via
newly added printk_stack_address) and %pB for regs->ip (via
printk_address). I.e. we revert to the old behaviour for all
except call stacks. And since from all those reliable is 1, we
remove that parameter from printk_address.
