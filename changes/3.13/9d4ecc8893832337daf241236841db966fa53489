perf tools: Synthesize anon MMAP records again

When introducing the PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 in:

5c5e854bc760 perf tools: Add attr->mmap2 support

A check for the number of entries parsed by sscanf was introduced that
assumed all of the 8 fields needed to be correctly parsed so that
particular /proc/pid/maps line would be considered synthesizable.

That broke anon records synthesizing, as it doesn't have the 'execname'
field.

Fix it by keeping the sscanf return check, changing it to not require
that the 'execname' variable be parsed, so that the preexisting logic
can kick in and set it to '//anon'.

This should get things like JIT profiling working again.
