Staging: zram: Fix access of NULL pointer

This patch fixes the bug in reset_store caused by accessing NULL pointer.

The bdev gets its value from bdget_disk() which could fail when memory
pressure is severe and hence can return NULL because allocation of
inode in bdget could fail.

Hence, this patch introduces a check for bdev to prevent reference to a
NULL pointer in the later part of the code. It also removes unnecessary
check of bdev for fsync_bdev().
