ASoC: snd_soc_codec includes snd_soc_component

Codec includes component by this patch,
and component moved to upside of codec
to avoid extra declaration.
Codec dai will be registered via component
by this patch.

Current component register function
is used for cpu, and it is using
dai/dais functions properly to keep
existing cpu dai name.

And now, it will be used from codec also.
But codec driver had been used dais function only
even though it was single dai.
This patch adds new flag which can selects
dai/dais function on component register
function to keep existing codec dai name.
