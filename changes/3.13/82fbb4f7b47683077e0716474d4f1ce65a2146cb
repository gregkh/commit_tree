ALSA: add DICE driver

As a start point for further development, this is an incomplete driver
for DICE devices:
- only playback (so no clock source except the bus clock)
- only 44.1 kHz
- no MIDI
- recovery after bus reset is slow
- hwdep device is created, but not actually implemented

Contains compilation fixes by Stefan Richter.
