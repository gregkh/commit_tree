audit: move audit_aux_data_execve contents into audit_context union

audit_bprm() was being called to add an AUDIT_EXECVE record to the audit
context every time search_binary_handler() was recursively called.  Only one
reference is necessary, so just update it.  Move the the contents of
audit_aux_data_execve into the union in audit_context, removing dependence on a
kmalloc along the way.
