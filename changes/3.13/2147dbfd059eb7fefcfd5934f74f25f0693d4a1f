GFS2: Use generic list_lru for quota

By using the generic list_lru code, we can now separate the
per sb quota list locking from the lru locking. The lru
lock is made into the inner-most lock.

As a result of this new lock order, we may occasionally see
items on the per-sb quota list which are "dead" so that the
two places where we traverse that list are updated to take
account of that.

As a result of this patch, the gfs2 quota shrinker is now
NUMA zone aware, and we are also laying the foundations for
further improvments in due course.
