arm: omap3: twl: add phy consumer data in twl4030_usb_data

The PHY framework uses the phy consumer data populated in platform data in the
case of non-dt boot to return the reference to the PHY when the controller
(PHY consumer) requests for it. So populated the phy consumer data in the platform
data of twl usb.
