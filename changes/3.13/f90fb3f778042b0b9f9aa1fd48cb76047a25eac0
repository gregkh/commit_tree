ASoC: Remove infrastructure for supporting multiple cache types

The only cache type left is the flat cache and new other cache types won't be
added since new drivers are supposed to use regmap directly for IO and caching.
This patch removes the snd_soc_cache_ops indirection that was added to support
multiple cache types and modifies the code to always use the flat cache
directly.
