PM / Hibernate: Use bool for boolean fields of struct snapshot_data

The snapshot_data structure used internally by the hibernate user
space interface code in user.c has three char fields that are used
to store boolean values.  Change their data type to bool and use
true and false instead of 1 and 0, respectively, in assignments
involving those fields.
