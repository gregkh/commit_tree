NFC Digital: Implement driver commands mechanism

This implements the mechanism used to send commands to the driver in
initiator mode through in_send_cmd().

Commands are serialized and sent to the driver by using a work item
on the system workqueue. Responses are handled asynchronously by
another work item. Once the digital stack receives the response through
the command_complete callback, the next command is sent to the driver.

This also implements the polling mechanism. It's handled by a work item
cycling on all supported protocols. The start poll command for a given
protocol is sent to the driver using the mechanism described above.
The process continues until a peer is discovered or stop_poll is
called. This patch implements the poll function for NFC-A that sends a
SENS_REQ command and waits for the SENS_RES response.
