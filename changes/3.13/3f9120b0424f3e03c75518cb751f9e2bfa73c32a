driver core: prevent deferred probe with platform_driver_probe

Prevent drivers relying on platform_driver_probe from requesting
deferred probing in order to avoid further futile probe attempts (either
the driver has been unregistered or its probe function has been set to
platform_drv_probe_fail when probing is retried).

Note that several platform drivers currently return subsystem errors
from probe and that these can include -EPROBE_DEFER (e.g. if a gpio
request fails).

Add a warning to platform_drv_probe that can be used to catch drivers
that inadvertently request probe deferral while using
platform_driver_probe.
