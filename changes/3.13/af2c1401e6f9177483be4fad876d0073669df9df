mm: numa: guarantee that tlb_flush_pending updates are visible before page table updates

According to documentation on barriers, stores issued before a LOCK can
complete after the lock implying that it's possible tlb_flush_pending
can be visible after a page table update.  As per revised documentation,
this patch adds a smp_mb__before_spinlock to guarantee the correct
ordering.
