cgroup: fix cgroup_subsys_state leak for seq_files

If a cgroup file implements either read_map() or read_seq_string(),
such file is served using seq_file by overriding file->f_op to
cgroup_seqfile_operations, which also overrides the release method to
single_release() from cgroup_file_release().

Because cgroup_file_open() didn't use to acquire any resources, this
used to be fine, but since f7d58818ba42 ("cgroup: pin
cgroup_subsys_state when opening a cgroupfs file"), cgroup_file_open()
pins the css (cgroup_subsys_state) which is put by
cgroup_file_release().  The patch forgot to update the release path
for seq_files and each open/release cycle leaks a css reference.

Fix it by updating cgroup_file_release() to also handle seq_files and
using it for seq_file release path too.
