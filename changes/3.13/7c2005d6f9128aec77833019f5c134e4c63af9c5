Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP command reject reason

There are several possible reason codes that can be sent in the command
reject L2CAP packet. Before this patch the code has used a hard-coded
single response code ("command not understood"). This patch adds a
helper function to map the return value of an L2CAP handler function to
the correct command reject reason.
