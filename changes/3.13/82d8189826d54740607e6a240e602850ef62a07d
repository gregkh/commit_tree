veth: extend features to support tunneling

While investigating on a recent vxlan regression, I found veth
was using a zero features set for vxlan tunnels.

We have to segment GSO frames, copy the payload, and do the checksum.

This patch brings a ~200% performance increase

We probably have to add hw_enc_features support
on other virtual devices.
