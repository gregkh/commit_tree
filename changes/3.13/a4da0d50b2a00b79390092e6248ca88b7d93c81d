powerpc: Implement arch_get_random_long/int() for powernv

Add the plumbing to implement arch_get_random_long/int(). It didn't seem
worth adding an extra ppc_md hook for int, so we reuse the one for long.

Add an implementation for powernv based on the hwrng found in power7+
systems. We whiten the output of the hwrng, and the result passes all
the dieharder tests.
