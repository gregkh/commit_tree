s390/vdso: ectg gettime support for CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID

The code to use the ECTG instruction to calculate the cputime for the
current thread is currently used only for the per-thread CPU-clock
with the clockid -2 (PID=0, VIRT=1). Use the same code for the clockid
CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID to speed up the more common clockid as well.
