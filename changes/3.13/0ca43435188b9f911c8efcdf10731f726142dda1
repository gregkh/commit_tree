errno.h: remove "NFS" from descriptions in comments

glibc recently changed the error string for ESTALE to remove "NFS" -

https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96945714ec61951cc748da2b4b8a80cf02127ee9

from: [ERR_REMAP (ESTALE)] = N_("Stale NFS file handle"),
to:   [ERR_REMAP (ESTALE)] = N_("Stale file handle"),

And some have expressed concern that the kernel's errno.h
comments still refer to NFS.

So make that change... note that this is a comment-only change,
and has no functional difference.
