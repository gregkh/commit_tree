parisc: sticon - unbreak on 64bit kernel

STI text console (sticon) was broken on 64bit machines with more than
4GB RAM and this lead in some cases to a kernel crash.

Since sticon uses the 32bit STI API it needs to keep pointers to memory
below 4GB. But on a 64bit kernel some memory regions (e.g. the kernel
stack) might be above 4GB which then may crash the kernel in the STI
functions.

Additionally sticon didn't selected the built-in framebuffer fonts by
default. This is now fixed.

On a side-note: Theoretically we could enhance the sticon driver to
use the 64bit STI API. But - beside the fact that some machines don't
provide a 64bit STI ROM - this would just add complexity.
