drm/i915: Fix scanoutpos calculations

The reported scanout position must be relative to the end of vblank.
Currently we manage to fumble that in a few ways.

First we don't consider the case when vtotal != vbl_end. While that
isn't very common (happens maybe only w/ old panel fitting hardware),
we can fix it easily enough.

The second issue is that on pre-CTG hardware we convert the pixel count
to horizontal/vertical components at the very beginning, and then forget
to adjust the horizontal component to be relative to vbl_end. So instead
we should keep our numbers in the pixel count domain while we're
adjusting the position to be relative to vbl_end. Then when we do the
conversion in the end, both vertical _and_ horizontal components will
come out correct.

v2: Change position to int from u32 to avoid sign issues
