nfs: use IS_ROOT not DCACHE_DISCONNECTED

This check was added by Al Viro with
d9e80b7de91db05c1c4d2e5ebbfd70b3b3ba0e0f "nfs d_revalidate() is too
trigger-happy with d_drop()", with the explanation that we don't want to
remove the root of a disconnected tree, which will still be included on
the s_anon list.

But DCACHE_DISCONNECTED does *not* actually identify dentries that are
disconnected from the dentry tree or hashed on s_anon.  IS_ROOT() is the
way to do that.

Also add a comment from Al's commit to remind us why this check is
there.
