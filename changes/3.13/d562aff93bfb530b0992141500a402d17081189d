tracing: Add support for SOFT_DISABLE to syscall events

The original SOFT_DISABLE patches didn't add support for soft disable
of syscall events; this adds it.

Add an array of ftrace_event_file pointers indexed by syscall number
to the trace array and remove the existing enabled bitmaps, which as a
result are now redundant.  The ftrace_event_file structs in turn
contain the soft disable flags we need for per-syscall soft disable
accounting.

Adding ftrace_event_files also means we can remove the USE_CALL_FILTER
bit, thus enabling multibuffer filter support for syscall events.
