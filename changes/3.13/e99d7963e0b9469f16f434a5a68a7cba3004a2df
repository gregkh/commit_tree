ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva-reference: add SDHI and MMCIF interfaces

Add SDHI0 and MMCIF interfaces to armadillo800eva-reference with
regulators and pin configurations. SDHI1 is not added yet, because the
switch, that connects the interface either to an SD slot or to a WiFi
SDIO card cannot be described in DT yet.
