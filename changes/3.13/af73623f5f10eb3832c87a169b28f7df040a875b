[SCSI] sd: Reduce buffer size for vpd request

Somehow older areca firmware versions have issues with
scsi_get_vpd_page() and a large buffer, the firmware
seems to crash and the scsi error-handler will start endless
recovery retries.
Limiting the buf-size to 64-bytes fixes this issue with older
firmware versions (<1.49 for my controller).

Fixes a regression with areca controllers and older firmware versions
