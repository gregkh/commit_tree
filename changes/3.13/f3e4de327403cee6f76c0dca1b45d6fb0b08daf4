ARC: cacheflush refactor #1: push aux reg ascertaining into leaf routine

ARC dcache supports 3 ops - Inv, Flush, Flush-n-Inv.
The programming model however provides 2 commands FLUSH, INV.
INV will either discard or flush-n-discard (based on DT_CTRL bit)

The leaf helper __dc_line_loop() used to take the AUX register
(corresponding to the 2 commands). Now we push that to within the
helper, paving way for code consolidations to follow.
