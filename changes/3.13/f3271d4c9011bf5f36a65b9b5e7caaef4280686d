KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't crash host on unknown guest interrupt

If we come out of a guest with an interrupt that we don't know about,
instead of crashing the host with a BUG(), we now return to userspace
with the exit reason set to KVM_EXIT_UNKNOWN and the trap vector in
the hw.hardware_exit_reason field of the kvm_run structure, as is done
on x86.  Note that run->exit_reason is already set to KVM_EXIT_UNKNOWN
at the beginning of kvmppc_handle_exit().
