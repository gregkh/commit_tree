ARM: pl01x debug code endian fix

The PL01X debug code needs to take into account which endian mode the
processor is running in. If it is big-endian, ensure the data is swapped
appropriately.

Note, we could do this slightly more efficiently if we have an macro to
do the necessary swap for the bits used by test.
