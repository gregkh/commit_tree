ASoC: rcar: remove RSND_SSI_CLK_FROM_ADG

R-Car sound has clock pin for each SSI, and sometimes,
these pins are shared with paired SSI.
It may sometimes become "SSI-A clock pin is master" and
"SSI-B clock pin is slave", but "SSI-A/B clock pins are shared".
SSI-B needs SSI-A clock in this case.

Current R-Car sound driver is using RSND_SSI_xxx flag
to control this kind of shared pin behavior.

But, this information, especially clock master setting,
can be got from ASoC set_fmt settings.
This patch removes rsnd_ssi_mode_init() and extend rsnd_ssi_mode_set()
to controlling pin settings via .set_fmt.

This patch doesn't removes RSND_SSI_CLK_FROM_ADG flag at this point
to avoid conflict branch merging between ASoC <-> SH-ARM.
