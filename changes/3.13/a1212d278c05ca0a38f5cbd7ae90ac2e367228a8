Revert "sysfs: drop kobj_ns_type handling"

This reverts commit cb26a311578e67769e92a39a0a63476533cb7e12.

It mysteriously causes NetworkManager to not find the wireless device
for me.  As far as I can tell, Tejun *meant* for this commit to not make
any semantic changes, but there clearly are some.  So revert it, taking
into account some of the calling convention changes that happened in
this area in subsequent commits.
