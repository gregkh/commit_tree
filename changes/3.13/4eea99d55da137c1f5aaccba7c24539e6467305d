[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix WRB_Q posting to support Dual Chute mode

Configuration parameters return number of CID each chute supports. The WRB_Q
is created for the passed CID count. If both the Chute has iSCSI Protocol then
WRB_Q creation is in a round robin mechanism.

For BE-X family iSCSI protocol is loaded only on single chute.
