KVM: PPC: Book3S: PR: Make svcpu -> vcpu store preempt savvy

As soon as we get back to our "highmem" handler in virtual address
space we may get preempted. Today the reason we can get preempted is
that we replay interrupts and all the lazy logic thinks we have
interrupts enabled.

However, it's not hard to make the code interruptible and that way
we can enable and handle interrupts even earlier.

This fixes random guest crashes that happened with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
for me.
