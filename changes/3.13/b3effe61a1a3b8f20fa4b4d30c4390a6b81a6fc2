ath10k: implement host memory chunks

10.X firmware can request a memory pool from host to offload
it's own resources. This is a feature designed especially
for AP mode where the target has to deal with large number
of peers.

So we allocate and map a consistent DMA memory which FW can
use to store e.g. peer rate contol maps.
