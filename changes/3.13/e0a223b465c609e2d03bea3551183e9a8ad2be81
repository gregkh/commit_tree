staging: ft1000: duplicate code replaced with call to request_code_segment

function scram_dnldr, in ft1000_download.c, is very long and consists
mainly of nested switch statements inside a while loop. Some code in one
of the inner switch cases was almost identical to the code in the
previously extracted function request_code_segment. The duplicated code
was replaced with a call to request_code_segment, and
request_code_segment was slightly modified to work in both cases.

A new parameter was added to request_code_segment, a bool to distinguish
which case it was replacing. The name of an existing parameter (now
called endpoint) was changed to reflect the fact that it will be passed
in from more than one place. Several lines from the case containing the
duplicated code were moved to request_code_segment, and a test was added
to determine if these lines or a line from the original function should
be run.

Finally, an unused variable (tempword) was removed from scram_dnldr.
