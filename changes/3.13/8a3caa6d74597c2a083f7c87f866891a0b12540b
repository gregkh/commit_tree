KVM: kvm_clear_guest_page(): fix empty_zero_page usage

Using the address of 'empty_zero_page' as source address in order to
clear a page is wrong. On some architectures empty_zero_page is only the
pointer to the struct page of the empty_zero_page.  Therefore the clear
page operation would copy the contents of a couple of struct pages instead
of clearing a page.  For kvm only arm/arm64 are affected by this bug.

To fix this use the ZERO_PAGE macro instead which will return the struct
page address of the empty_zero_page on all architectures.
