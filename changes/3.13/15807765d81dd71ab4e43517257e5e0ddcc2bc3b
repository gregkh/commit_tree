[media] gscpa_ov534_9: Add support for ov3610 sensor

Dear Hans de Goede, I have Ubuntu (raring) and recently bought digital
microscope eyepiece Lomo MD300. It is the same device as Future Optics MVV3000.
Unfortunately it does not work out of box. Moreover drivers refused to work
under Windows 7 as well leaving me only with Win Xp working system. I have had
no choice but to examine what happened in USB bus and attempt to reproduce the
sequence. So, i have download the source(3.8.0-30 kernel) and made required
changes to driver to make my hardware work.
I submit my changed files to you as maintainer of the driver so you can
integrade my changes into main stream. Thanx. Hopefully my Ubuntu will work
with my hardware out of box.
Sincerely yours Vladik Aranov
