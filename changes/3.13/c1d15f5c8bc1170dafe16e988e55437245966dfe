xen/balloon: Seperate the auto-translate logic properly (v2)

The auto-xlat logic vs the non-xlat means that we don't need to for
auto-xlat guests (like PVH, HVM or ARM):
 - use P2M
 - use scratch page.

However the code in increase_reservation does modify the p2m for
auto_translate guests, but not in decrease_reservation.

Fix that by avoiding any p2m modifications in both increase_reservation
and decrease_reservation for auto_translated guests.

And also avoid allocating or using scratch pages for auto_translated guests.

Lastly, since !auto-xlat is really another way of saying 'xen_pv'
remove the redundant 'xen_pv_domain' check.
