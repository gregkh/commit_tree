gcov: move gcov structs definitions to a gcc version specific file

Since also the gcov structures(gcov_info, gcov_fn_info, gcov_ctr_info) can
change between gcc releases, as shown in gcc 4.7, they cannot be defined
in a common header and need to be moved to a specific gcc implemention
file.  This also requires to make the gcov_info structure opaque for the
common code and to introduce simple helpers for accessing data inside
gcov_info.
