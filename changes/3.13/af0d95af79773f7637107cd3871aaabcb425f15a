uprobes: Teach __create_xol_area() to accept the predefined vaddr

Currently xol_add_vma() uses get_unmapped_area() for area->vaddr,
but the next patches need to use the fixed address. So this patch
adds the new "vaddr" argument to __create_xol_area() which should
be used as area->vaddr if it is nonzero.

xol_add_vma() doesn't bother to verify that the predefined addr is
not used, insert_vm_struct() should fail if find_vma_links() detects
the overlap with the existing vma.

Also, __create_xol_area() doesn't need __GFP_ZERO to allocate area.
