powerpc/mpic: Disable preemption when calling mpic_processor_id()

Otherwise, we get a debug traceback due to the use of
smp_processor_id() (or get_paca()) inside hard_smp_processor_id().
mpic_host_map() is just looking for a default CPU, so it doesn't matter
if we migrate after getting the CPU ID.
