sysfs: @name comes before @ns

Some internal sysfs functions which take explicit namespace argument
are weird in that they place the optional @ns in front of @name which
is contrary to the established convention.  This is confusing and
error-prone especially as @ns and @name may be interchanged without
causing compilation warning.

Swap the positions of @name and @ns in the following internal
functions.

 sysfs_find_dirent()
 sysfs_rename()
 sysfs_hash_and_remove()
 sysfs_name_hash()
 sysfs_name_compare()
 create_dir()

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
