drm/i915: add plumbing for SWSCI

SWSCI is a driver to bios call interface.

This checks for SWSCI availability and bios requested callbacks, and
filters out any calls that shouldn't happen. This way the callers don't
need to do the checks all over the place.

v2: silence some checkpatch nagging

v3: set PCI_SWSCI bit 0 to trigger interrupt (Mengdong Lin)

v4: remove an extra #define (Jesse)

v5: spec says s/w is responsible for clearing PCI_SWSCI bit 0 too

v6: per Paulo's review and more:
 - fix sub-function mask
 - add exit parameter
 - add define for set panel details call
 - return more errors from swsci
 - clean up the supported/requested callbacks bit masks mess
 - use DSLP for timeout
 - fix build for CONFIG_ACPI=n

v7: tiny adjustment of requested vs. supported SBCB callbacks handling (Paulo)
