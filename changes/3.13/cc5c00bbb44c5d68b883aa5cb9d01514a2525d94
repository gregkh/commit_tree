gro: Only verify TCP checksums for candidates

In some cases we may receive IP packets that are longer than
their stated lengths.  Such packets are never merged in GRO.
However, we may end up computing their checksums incorrectly
and end up allowing packets with a bogus checksum enter our
stack with the checksum status set as verified.

Since such packets are rare and not performance-critical, this
patch simply skips the checksum verification for them.
