drm/edid: compare actual vrefresh for all modes for quirks

The vrefresh field of the mode is 0 for most modes
fetched from the EDID (e.g., established timings).
When dealing with monitors that have a bogus preferred
mode, we may not always select the mode we want because
we compare the target refresh to the mode's vrefresh which
is 0 in a lot of cases.
