xen: privcmd: do not return pages which we have failed to unmap

This failure represents a hypervisor issue, but if it does occur then nothing
good can come of returning pages which still refer to a foreign owned page
into the general allocation pool.

Instead we are forced to leak them. Log that we have done so.

The potential for failure only exists for autotranslated guest (e.g. ARM and
x86 PVH).
