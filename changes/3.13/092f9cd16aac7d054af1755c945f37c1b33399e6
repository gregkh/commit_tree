ALSA: msnd: Avoid duplicated driver name

msnd_pinnacle.c is used for both snd-msnd-pinnacle and
snd-msnd-classic drivers, and both should have different driver
names.  Using the same driver name results in the sysfs warning for
duplicated entries like
 kobject: 'msnd-pinnacle.7' (cec33408): kobject_release, parent   (null) (delayed)
 kobject: 'msnd-pinnacle' (cecd4980): kobject_release, parent cf3ad9b0 (delayed)
 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at fs/sysfs/dir.c:486 sysfs_warn_dup+0x7d/0xa0()
 sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/bus/isa/drivers/msnd-pinnacle'
