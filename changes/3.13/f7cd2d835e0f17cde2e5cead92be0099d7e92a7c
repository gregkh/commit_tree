ARM: vexpress/TC2: add support for CPU DVFS

SPC(Serial Power Controller) on TC2 also controls the CPU performance
operating points which is essential to provide CPU DVFS. The M3
microcontroller provides two sets of eight performance values, one set
for each cluster (CA15 or CA7). Each of this value contains the
frequency(kHz) and voltage(mV) at that performance level. It expects
these performance level to be passed through the SPC PERF_LVL registers.

This patch adds support to populate these performance levels from M3,
build the mapping to CPU OPPs at the boot and then use it to get and
set the CPU performance level runtime.
