Btrfs: do not inc uncorrectable_errors counter on ro scrubs

Currently if we discover an error when scrubbing in ro mode we a)
blindly increment the uncorrectable_errors counter, and b) spam the
dmesg with the 'unable to fixup (regular) error at ...' message, even
though a) we haven't tried to determine if the error is correctable or
not, and b) we haven't tried to fixup anything.  Fix this.
