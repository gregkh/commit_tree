MIPS: ZBOOT: Support LZ4 compression scheme

Add support for the LZ4 compression scheme in the ZBOOT decompression
stub, in order to support it we need to:

- select the "lz4" compression tool to compress the vmlinux.bin
  payload
- memcpy() is also required for decompress_unlz4.c so we share the
  implementation between GZIP, XZ and now LZ4
