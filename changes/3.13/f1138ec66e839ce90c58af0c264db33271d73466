tools/perf/build: Speed up auto-detection

The detection of certain rarely detected features can be delayed
to when they are actually needed.

So speed up the common case of auto-detection by pre-building only
a core set of features and populating only their feature-flags.

[ Features not listed in CORE_FEATURES need to built explicitly
  via the feature_check() function. ]

(Also order the feature names alphabetically, while at it.)
