KVM: Move gfn_to_index to x86 specific code

The gfn_to_index function relies on huge page defines which either may
not make sense on systems that don't support huge pages or are defined
in an unconvenient way for other architectures.  Since this is
x86-specific, move the function to arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_host.h.
