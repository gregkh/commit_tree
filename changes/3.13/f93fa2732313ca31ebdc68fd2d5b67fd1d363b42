Bluetooth: Remove socket lock from l2cap_state_change()

This simplify and make safer the state change handling inside l2cap_core.c.
we got rid of __l2cap_state_change(). And l2cap_state_change() doesn't lock
the socket anymore, instead the socket is locked inside the ops callback for
state change in l2cap_sock.c.

It makes the code safer because in some we were using a unlocked version,
and now we are calls to l2cap_state_change(), when dealing with sockets, use
the locked version.
