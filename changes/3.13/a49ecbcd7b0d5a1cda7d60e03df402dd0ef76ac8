mm/memory-failure.c: recheck PageHuge() after hugetlb page migrate successfully

After a successful hugetlb page migration by soft offline, the source
page will either be freed into hugepage_freelists or buddy(over-commit
page).  If page is in buddy, page_hstate(page) will be NULL.  It will
hit a NULL pointer dereference in dequeue_hwpoisoned_huge_page().

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000058
  IP: [<ffffffff81163761>] dequeue_hwpoisoned_huge_page+0x131/0x1d0
  PGD c23762067 PUD c24be2067 PMD 0
  Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP

So check PageHuge(page) after call migrate_pages() successfully.
