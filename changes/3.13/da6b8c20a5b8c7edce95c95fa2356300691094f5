batman-adv: generalize batman-adv icmp packet handling

Instead of handling icmp packets only up to length of icmp_packet_rr,
the code should handle any icmp length size. Therefore the length
truncating is moved to when the packet is actually sent to userspace
(this does not support lengths longer than icmp_packet_rr yet). Longer
packets are forwarded without truncating.

This patch also cleans up some parts where the icmp header struct could
be used instead of other icmp_packet(_rr) structs to make the code more
readable.
