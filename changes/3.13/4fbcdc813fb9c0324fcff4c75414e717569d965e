clocksource: arm_arch_timer: Use clocksource for suspend timekeeping

The ARM architected timers keep counting during suspend so we can
mark this clocksource with the CLOCK_SOURCE_SUSPEND_NONSTOP flag.
This flag will indicate that this clocksource can be used for
calculating suspend time and injecting sleep time into the
timekeeping core. This should be more accurate than using an
external RTC or architecture specific persistent clock.
