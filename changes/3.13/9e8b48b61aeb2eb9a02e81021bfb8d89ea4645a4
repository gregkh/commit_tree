ARM: shmobile: Sync KZM9D DTS with KZM9D reference DTS

Copy the device nodes from KZM9D reference into the KZM9D
device tree file. This will allow us to use a single DTS
file regarless of kernel configuration. In case of legacy
C board code the device nodes may or may not be used, but
in the multiplatform case all the DT device nodes are used.
