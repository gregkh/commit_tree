Bluetooth: Store device name in scan response data

The scan response data is a better place to store the device name
since it has more space available and is also enforcing privacy.

When the controller is advertising, the connectable setting decides
if ADV_IND or ADV_NONCONN_IND is used. In case of ADV_IND, the
remote side is allowed to request the scan response data. Same as
with BR/EDR where either EIR is used or a remote name request. In
non-connectable mode, the device name is not available since it is
not allowed to request scan response data. Same as in BR/EDR where
the device is non-discoverable and no name requests are answered.
