regulator: core: add support for configuring turn-on time through constraints

The turn-on time of the regulator depends on the regulator device's
electrical characteristics. Sometimes regulator turn-on time also
depends on the capacitive load on the given platform and it can be
more than the datasheet value.

The driver provides the enable-time as per datasheet.

Add support for configure the enable ramp time through regulator
constraints so that regulator core can take this value for enable
time for that regulator.
