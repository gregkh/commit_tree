KVM: nVMX: Unconditionally uninit the MMU on nested vmexit

Three reasons for doing this: 1. arch.walk_mmu points to arch.mmu anyway
in case nested EPT wasn't in use. 2. this aligns VMX with SVM. But 3. is
most important: nested_cpu_has_ept(vmcs12) queries the VMCS page, and if
one guest VCPU manipulates the page of another VCPU in L2, we may be
fooled to skip over the nested_ept_uninit_mmu_context, leaving mmu in
nested state. That can crash the host later on if nested_ept_get_cr3 is
invoked while L1 already left vmxon and nested.current_vmcs12 became
NULL therefore.
