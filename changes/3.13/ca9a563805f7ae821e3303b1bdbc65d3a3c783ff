iio: ti_am335x_adc: Add continuous sampling support

Previously the driver had only one-shot reading functionality.
This patch adds continuous sampling support to the driver.

Continuous sampling starts when buffer is enabled.
HW IRQ wakes worker thread that pushes samples to userspace.
Sampling stops when buffer is disabled by userspace.

Patil Rachna (TI) laid the ground work for ADC HW register access.
Russ Dill (TI) fixed bugs in the driver relevant to FIFOs and IRQs.

I fixed channel scanning so multiple ADC channels can be read
simultaneously and pushed to userspace.
Restructured the driver to fit IIO ABI.
And added INDIO_BUFFER_HARDWARE mode.
