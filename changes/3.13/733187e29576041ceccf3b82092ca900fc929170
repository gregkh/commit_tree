powerpc/pseries: Fix dedicated processor partition detection

commit f13c13a00512 (powerpc: Stop using non-architected shared_proc
field in lppaca) fixed a potential issue with shared/dedicated
partition detection. The old method of detection relied on an
unarchitected field (shared_proc), and this patch switched
to using something architected (a non zero yield_count).

Unfortunately the assertion in the Linux header that yield_count
is only non zero on shared processor partitions is not true. It
turns out dedicated processor partitions can increment yield_count
and as such we falsely detect dedicated partitions as shared.

Fix the comment, and switch back to using the old method.
