perf evsel: Remove idx parm from constructor

Most uses of the evsel constructor are followed by a call to
perf_evlist__add with an idex of evlist->nr_entries, so make rename
the current constructor to perf_evsel__new_idx and remove the need
for passing the constructor for the common case.

We still need the new_idx variant because the way groups are handled,
with evsel->nr_members holding the number of entries in an evlist,
partitioning the evlist into sublists inside a single linked list.

This asks for a clarifying refactoring, but for now simplify the non
parser cases, so that tool writers don't have to bother with evsel idx
setting.
