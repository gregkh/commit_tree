perf lock: Account for lock average wait time

While perf-lock currently reports both the total wait time and the
number of contentions, it doesn't explicitly show the average wait time.
Having this value immediately in the report can be quite useful when
looking into performance issues.

Furthermore, allowing report to sort by averages is another handy
feature to have - and thus do not only print the value, but add it to
the lock_stat structure.
