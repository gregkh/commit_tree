Bluetooth: Add the definition and structure for Set CSB Data

The Set_Connectionless_Slave_Broadcast_Data command provides the
ability for the Host to set Connectionless Slave Broadcast data in
the BR/EDR Controller.

The Core Spec Addendum 4 adds this command in part B Connectionless
Slave Broadcast.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 4 - Page 93

"7.3.88 Set Connectionless Slave Broadcast Data Command [New Section]
...
If connectionless slave broadcast mode is disabled, this data shall be
kept by the BR/EDR Controller and used once connectionless slave broadcast
mode is enabled. If connectionless slave broadcast mode is enabled,
and this command is successful, this data will be sent starting with
the next Connectionless Slave Broadcast instant.

The Data_Length field may be zero, in which case no data needs to be
provided.

The Host may fragment the data using the Fragment field in the command. If
the combined length of the fragments exceeds the capacity of the largest
allowed packet size specified in the Set Connectionless Slave Broadcast
command, all fragments associated with the data being assembled shall be
discarded and the Invalid HCI Command Parameters error (0x12) shall be
returned."
