Bluetooth: Fix double error response for l2cap_create_chan_req

When an L2CAP request handler returns non-zero the calling code will
send a command reject response. The l2cap_create_chan_req function will
in some cases send its own response but then still return a -EFAULT
error which would cause two responses to be sent. This patch fixes this
by making the function return 0 after sending its own response.
