gpiolib / ACPI: convert to gpiod interfaces

The new GPIO descriptor based interface is now preferred over the old
integer based one. This patch converts the ACPI GPIO helpers to use this
new interface internally. In addition to that provide compatibility
function acpi_get_gpio_by_index() that converts the returned GPIO
descriptor to an integer.

We also drop acpi_get_gpio() as it is not used anywhere outside
gpiolib-acpi and even there we use acpi_get_gpiod() instead.
