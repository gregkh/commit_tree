drm/nv10: introduce a new NV_11 card type

NV11/17/1F/18 come after NV10/15/16/1A. In order to facilitate using
numerical comparisons, split up the two sets into different card types.

This change should be a no-op except that the relevant cards will see
NV11 printed instead of NV10 for the family.
