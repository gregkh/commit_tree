netpoll: fix rx_hook() interface by passing the skb

Right now skb->data is passed to rx_hook() even if the skb
has not been linearised and without giving rx_hook() a way
to linearise it.

Change the rx_hook() interface and make it accept the skb
and the offset to the UDP payload as arguments. rx_hook() is
also renamed to rx_skb_hook() to ensure that out of the tree
users notice the API change.

In this way any rx_skb_hook() implementation can perform all
the needed operations to properly (and safely) access the
skb data.
