spi: core: invert success test in devm_spi_register_master

devres_add() should be called when the action to be undone succeeded,
not when it failed. Fix the inverted test in devm_spi_register_master()
which was doing the opposite.

The user-visible issue without this fix is:
insmod spi-tegra114.ko
  Assume there's an MTD device on that SPI bus, which creates /dev/mtd0.
rmmod spi-tegra114
  Doesn't remove devices on the SPI bus.
insmod spi-tegra114.ko
  Creates a duplicate SPI device which creates /dev/mtd1.
hexdump -C /dev/mtd0
  That's the old device, which uses an SPI bus hosted by a non-existent
  module, which causes the oops below.
