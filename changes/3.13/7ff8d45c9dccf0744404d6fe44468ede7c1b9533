Fix corrupt SMB2 ioctl requests

We were off by one calculating the length of ioctls in some cases
because the protocol specification for SMB2 ioctl includes a mininum
one byte payload but not all SMB2 ioctl requests actually have
a data buffer to send. We were also not zeroing out the
return buffer (in case of error this is helpful).
