regulatory: enable channels 52-64 and 100-144 for world roaming

If allowed in a country, these channels typically require DFS
so mark them as such. Channel 144 is a bit special, it's coming
into use now to allow more VHT 80 channels, but world roaming
with passive scanning is acceptable anyway. It seems fairly
unlikely that it'll be used as the control channel for a VHT
AP, but it needs to be present to allow a full VHT connection
to an AP that uses it as one of the secondary channels.

Also enable VHT 160 on these channels, and also for channels
36-48 to be able to use VHT 160 there.
