KEYS: Move the algorithm pointer array from x509 to public_key.c

Move the public-key algorithm pointer array from x509_public_key.c to
public_key.c as it isn't X.509 specific.

Note that to make this configure correctly, the public key part must be
dependent on the RSA module rather than the other way round.  This needs a
further patch to make use of the crypto module loading stuff rather than using
a fixed table.
