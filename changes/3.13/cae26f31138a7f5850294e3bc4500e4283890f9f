ARM: OMAP2+: More randconfig fixes for reconfigure_io_chain

Commit 26273e02a0cf (ARM: OMAP2+: Fix build for dra7xx without
omap4 and 5) attempted to fix randconfig found errors for
redefinition of omap44xx_prm_reconfigure_io_chain, but was
not enough.

We need to check for AM43XX without any omap4 or 5 related
SoCs as well. And looks like we have prm44xx.o built always
anyways with omap-4-5-prcm-common because of the calls to
omap4_prm_vp_clear_txdone, so we can remove the duplicate
entries in the Makefile.
