net: ipv4: Change variable type to bool

The variable fully_acked is only assigned the values true and false.
Change its type to bool.

The simplified semantic patch that find this problem is as
follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

@exists@
type T;
identifier b;
@@
- T
+ bool
  b = ...;
  ... when any
  b = \(true\|false\)
