imx-drm: ipu-v3: fix potential CRTC device registration race

Clean up the IPUv3 CRTC device registration; we don't need a separate
function just to call platform_device_register_data(), and we don't
need the return value converted at all.

Update the IPU client id under a mutex, so that parallel probing
doesn't race.
