tpm atmel: Call request_region with the correct base

Commit e0dd03caf20d040a0a86 ("tpm: return chip from
tpm_register_hardware") changed the code path here so that
ateml_get_base_addr no longer directly altered the tpm_vendor_specific
structure, and instead placed the base address on the stack.

The commit missed updating the request_region call, which would have
resulted in request_region being called with 0 as the base address.

I don't know if request_region(0, ..) will fail, if so the
driver has been broken since 2006 and we should remove it
from the tree as it has no users.
