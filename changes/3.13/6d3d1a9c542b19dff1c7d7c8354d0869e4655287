bcache: bugfix for race between moving_gc and bucket_invalidate

There is a possibility for a bucket to be invalidated by the allocator
while moving_gc was copying it's contents to another bucket, if the
bucket only held cached data. To prevent this moving checks for
a stale ptr (to an invalidated bucket), before and after reads.
It it finds one, it simply ignores moving that data. This only
affects bcache if the moving_gc was turned on, note that it's
off by default.
