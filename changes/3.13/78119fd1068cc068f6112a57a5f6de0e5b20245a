of/irq: Fix bug in interrupt parsing refactor.

Commit 2361613206e6, "of/irq: Refactor interrupt-map parsing" introduced
a bug. The irq parsing will fail for some nodes that don't have a reg
property. It is fixed by deferring the check for reg until it is
actually needed. Also adjust the testcase data to catch the bug.
