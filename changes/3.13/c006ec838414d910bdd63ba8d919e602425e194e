iio: add info_mask_[shared_by_dir/shared_by_all]

These two additional info_mask bitmaps should allow all 'standard'
numeric attributes to be handled using the read_raw and write_raw
callbacks.  Whilst this should reduce code, the more important element
is that this makes these values easily accessible to in kernel users
of IIO devices.
