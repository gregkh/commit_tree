ALSA: hda - hdmi: Re-setup pin and infoframe on plug-in on all codecs

hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe() does not set up pin and infoframe if there
is no connected sink. If a sink is connected while audio playback is
already in progress, the pin and infoframe will not be properly set up,
causing no audio or wrongly mapped audio.

On Intel Haswell codecs the hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe() is already
called again from hdmi_present_sense() when an ELD appears because
transcoder:port mapping may have changed.

Make the call non-Haswell-specific so that audio will be properly set up
if the playback was started before a sink was connected.

Tested on non-Haswell Intel HDMI codec by plugging sink in during
playback.
