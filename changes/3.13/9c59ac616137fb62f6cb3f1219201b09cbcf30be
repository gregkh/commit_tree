Partially revert "mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Introduce 'marvell,armada370-nand' compatible string"

This partially reverts c0f3b8643a6fa2461d70760ec49d21d2b031d611.

The "armada370-nand" compatible support is not complete, and it was mistake
to add it. Revert it and postpone the support until the infrastructure is
in place.
