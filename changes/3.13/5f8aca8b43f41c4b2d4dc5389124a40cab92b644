xfs: always hold the iolock when calling xfs_change_file_space

Currently fallocate always holds the iolock when calling into
xfs_change_file_space, while the ioctl path lets some of the lower level
functions take it, but leave it out in others.

This patch makes sure the ioctl path also always holds the iolock and
thus introduces consistent locking for the preallocation operations while
simplifying the code and allowing to kill the now unused XFS_ATTR_NOLOCK
flag.
