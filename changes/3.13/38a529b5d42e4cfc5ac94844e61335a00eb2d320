e1000e: Fix compilation warning when !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

Commit 7509963c703b (e1000e: Fix a compile flag mis-match for
suspend/resume) moved suspend and resume hooks to be available when
CONFIG_PM is set. However, it can be set even if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not set
causing following warnings to be emitted:

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c:6178:12: warning:
  	‘e1000_suspend’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c:6185:12: warning:
	‘e1000_resume’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

To fix this make the hooks to be available only when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is set
and remove CONFIG_PM wrapping from driver ops because this is already
handled by SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() and SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS().
