Stging: bcm: Adapter.h : removed typedef from struct _U_IP_ADDRESS and changed it to lowercase

Running checkpatch.pl on the file drivers/staging/bcm/Adapter.h gave
an error as it is a mistake to use typedef for structures
according to CodeingStyle as it reduces readability. The typedef was
removed and all occurrences of the typedef union were replaced with
union u_ip_address as types are all lowercase.
