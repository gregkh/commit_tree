ALSA: Add SNDRV_PCM_STATE_PAUSED case in wait_for_avail function

When the process is sleeping at the SNDRV_PCM_STATE_PAUSED
state from the wait_for_avail function, the sleep process will be woken by
timeout(10 seconds). Even if the sleep process wake up by timeout, by this
patch, the process will continue with sleep and wait for the other state.
