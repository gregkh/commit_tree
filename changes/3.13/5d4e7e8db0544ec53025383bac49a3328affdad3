Bluetooth: Add synchronization train parameters reading support

This patch adds support for reading the synchronization train parameters
for controllers that support the feature. Since the feature is
detectable through the local features page 2, which is retreived only in
stage 3 of the HCI init sequence, there is no other option than to add a
fourth stage to the init sequence.

For now the patch doesn't yet add storing of the parameters, but it is
nevertheless convenient to have around to see what kind of parameters
various controllers use by default (analyzable e.g. with the btmon user
space tool).
