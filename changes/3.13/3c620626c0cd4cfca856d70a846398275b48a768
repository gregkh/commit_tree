arm64: use generic RW_DATA_SECTION macro in linker script

The .data section in the arm64 linker script currently lacks a
definition for page-aligned data. This leads to a .page_aligned
section being placed between the end of data and start of bss.
This patch corrects that by using the generic RW_DATA_SECTION
macro which includes support for page-aligned data.
