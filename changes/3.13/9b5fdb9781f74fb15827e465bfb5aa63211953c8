KVM: ARM: Transparent huge page (THP) support

Support transparent huge pages in KVM/ARM and KVM/ARM64.  The
transparent_hugepage_adjust is not very pretty, but this is also how
it's solved on x86 and seems to be simply an artifact on how THPs
behave.  This should eventually be shared across architectures if
possible, but that can always be changed down the road.
