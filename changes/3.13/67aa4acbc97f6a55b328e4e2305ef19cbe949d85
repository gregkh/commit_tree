staging: comedi: avoid memleak for subdevice private

`comedi_alloc_spriv()` allocates private storage for a comedi subdevice
and sets the `SRF_FREE_SPRIV` flag in the `runflags` member of the
subdevice to allow the private storage to be automatically freed when
the comedi device is being cleaned up.  Unfortunately, the flag gets
clobbered by `do_cmd_ioctl()` which calls
`comedi_set_subdevice_runflags()` with a mask value `~0` and only the
`SRF_USER` and `SRF_RUNNING` flags set, all the other SRF flags being
cleared.

Change the calls to `comedi_set_subdevice_runflags()` that currently use
a mask value of `~0` to use a more relevant mask value.  For
`do_cmd_ioctl()`, the relevant SRF flags are `SRF_USER`, `SRF_ERROR` and
`SRF_RUNNING`.  (At one time, `SRF_RT` would be included in that set of
flags, but it is no longer used.)  For `comedi_alloc_spriv()` replace
the call to `comedi_set_subdevice_runflags()` with a simple
OR-assignment to avoid unnecessary use of a spin-lock.
