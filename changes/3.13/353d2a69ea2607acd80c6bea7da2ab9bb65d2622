mwifiex: fix issues in driver unload path for USB chipsets

1) After driver load failure, clear 'card->adapter' instead of
card pointer so that card specific cleanup is performed later
when user unloads the driver.

2) Clear usb_card pointer in disconnect handler to avoid invalid
memory access when user unloads the driver after removing the
card.
