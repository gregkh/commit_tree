drm/i915: Convert active API to VMA

Even though we track object activity and not VMA, because we have the
active_list be based on the VM, it makes the most sense to use VMAs in
the APIs.

NOTE: Daniel intends to eventually rip out active/inactive LRUs, but for
now, leave them be.

v2: Remove leftover hunk from the previous patch which didn't keep
i915_gem_object_move_to_active. That patch had to rely on the ring to
get the dev instead of the obj. (Chris)
