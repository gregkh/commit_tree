ALSA: hda - Apply MacBook fixups for CS4208 correctly

The commit [8fe7b65ab465: ALSA: hda - Apply GPIO setup for MacBooks
with CS4208] added a fixup entry matching with the vendor id 0x106b.
This broke the fixups for previous MBA6,1 and 6,2, since the PCI SSID
vendor id matches before evaluating the codec SSIDs.

We had a similar issue on Mac with Sigmatel codecs, and solve this
problem again similarly, by introducing a skeleton entry matching with
the all MacBooks, then remap to the right one.
