can: c_can: Fix RX message handling, handle lost message before EOB

If we handle end of block messages with higher priority than a lost message,
we can run into an endless interrupt loop.

This is reproducable with a am335x processor and "cansequence -r" at 1Mbit.
As soon as we loose a packet we can't escape from an interrupt loop.

This patch fixes the problem by handling lost packets before EOB packets.
