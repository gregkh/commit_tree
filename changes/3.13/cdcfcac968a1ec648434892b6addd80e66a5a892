ASoC: rcar: add rsnd_scu_hpbif_is_enable()

Current SSI needs RSND_SSI_DEPENDENT flag to
decide dependent/independent mode.
And SCU needs RSND_SCU_USE_HPBIF flag
to decide HPBIF is enable/disable.
But these 2 means same things.

This patch adds new rsnd_scu_hpbif_is_enable()
function, and merges above methods.
