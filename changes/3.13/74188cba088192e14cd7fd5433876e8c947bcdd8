hwmon: Provide managed hwmon registration

Drivers using the new hwmon_device_register_with_groups API often have a
remove function which consists solely of a call hwmon_device_unregister().

Provide support for devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups and
devm_hwmon_device_unregister to allow this repeated code to be removed
and help eliminate error handling code.
