net: ipv4 only populate IP_PKTINFO when needed

The since the removal of the routing cache computing
fib_compute_spec_dst() does a fib_table lookup for each UDP multicast
packet received.  This has introduced a performance regression for some
UDP workloads.

This change skips populating the packet info for sockets that do not have
IP_PKTINFO set.

Benchmark results from a netperf UDP_RR test:
Before 89789.68 transactions/s
After  90587.62 transactions/s

Benchmark results from a fio 1 byte UDP multicast pingpong test
(Multicast one way unicast response):
Before 12.63us RTT
After  12.48us RTT
