leds: lp5521/5523: Remove duplicate mutex

It can be a problem when a pattern is loaded via the firmware interface.
LP55xx common driver has already locked the mutex in 'lp55xx_firmware_loaded()'.
So it should be deleted.

On the other hand, locks are required in store_engine_load()
on updating program memory.
