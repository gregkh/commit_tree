PCI: Pass type, width, and prefetchability for window alignment

When calculating window_alignment(), type information like IORESOURCE_MEM
and IORESOURCE_PREFETCH may not be enough.  For example, on powernv, we
need to know whether the window is 64-bit or not.

This patch passes the full resource type (res->flags) for window alignment.
