xen-blkfront: restore the non-persistent data path

When persistent grants were added they were always used, even if the
backend doesn't have this feature (there's no harm in always using the
same set of pages). This restores the old data path when the backend
doesn't have persistent grants, removing the burden of doing a memcpy
when it is not actually needed.
