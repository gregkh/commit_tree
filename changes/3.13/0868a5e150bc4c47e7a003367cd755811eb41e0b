audit: printk USER_AVC messages when audit isn't enabled

When the audit=1 kernel parameter is absent and auditd is not running,
AUDIT_USER_AVC messages are being silently discarded.

AUDIT_USER_AVC messages should be sent to userspace using printk(), as
mentioned in the commit message of 4a4cd633 ("AUDIT: Optimise the
audit-disabled case for discarding user messages").

When audit_enabled is 0, audit_receive_msg() discards all user messages
except for AUDIT_USER_AVC messages. However, audit_log_common_recv_msg()
refuses to allocate an audit_buffer if audit_enabled is 0. The fix is to
special case AUDIT_USER_AVC messages in both functions.

It looks like commit 50397bd1 ("[AUDIT] clean up audit_receive_msg()")
introduced this bug.
