powerpc/mpc8xx: Clearer Oops message for Software Emulation Exception

This patch modifies the Oops message in case of Software Emulation Exception.
The existing message is quite confusing because it refers to FPU Emulation
while most often the issue is due to either a non supported instruction
(not necessarily FPU related) or a stale instruction due to HW issues.
The new message tries to be more generic in order to make the user understand
that the Oops is due to something wrong with an instruction, not necessarily
due to an FPU instruction.
