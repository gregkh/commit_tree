sysfs: add sysfs_open_file_mutex

Add a separate mutex to protect sysfs_open_dirent->buffers list.  This
will allow performing sleepable operations while traversing
sysfs_buffers, which will be renamed to sysfs_open_file.

Note that currently sysfs_open_dirent->buffers list isn't being used
for anything and this patch doesn't make any functional difference.
It will be used to merge regular and bin file supports.
