tracing: Do not assign filp->private_data to freed memory

In system_tr_open(), the filp->private_data can be assigned the 'dir'
variable even if it was freed. This is on the error path, and is
harmless because the error return code will prevent filp->private_data
from being used. But for correctness, we should not assign it to
a recently freed variable, as that can cause static tools to give
false warnings.

Also have both subsystem_open() and system_tr_open() return -ENODEV
if tracing has been disabled.
