imx-drm: imx-tve: don't call sleeping functions beneath enable_lock spinlock

Enable lock claims that it is serializing tve_enable/disable calls.
However, DRM already serialises mode sets with a mutex, which prevents
encoder/connector functions being called concurrently.  Secondly,
holding a spinlock while calling clk_prepare_enable() is wrong; it
will cause a might_sleep() warning should that debugging be enabled.
So, let's just get rid of the enable_lock.
