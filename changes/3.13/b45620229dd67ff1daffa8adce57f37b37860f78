[SCSI] Add 'eh_deadline' to limit SCSI EH runtime

This patchs adds an 'eh_deadline' sysfs attribute to the scsi
host which limits the overall runtime of the SCSI EH.
The 'eh_deadline' value is stored in the now obsolete field
'resetting'.
When a command is failed the start time of the EH is stored
in 'last_reset'. If the overall runtime of the SCSI EH is longer
than last_reset + eh_deadline, the EH is short-circuited and
falls through to issue a host reset only.
