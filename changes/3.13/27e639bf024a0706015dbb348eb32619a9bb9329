drm/i915: Make sure we respect n.max on VLV

We limit the maximum n divider value in order to make sure the PLL's
reference inout is at least 19.2 MHz. I assume that is done to satisfy
some hardware requirement.

However we never check whether that calculated limit is below the
maximum supoorted N divider value (7). In practice that is always true
since we only support 100 MHz reference clock, but making the code
safe against higher reference clocks seems like a reasoanble thing to
do.
