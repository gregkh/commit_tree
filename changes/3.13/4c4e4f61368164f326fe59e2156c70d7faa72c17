x86/locking/kconfig: Update paravirt spinlock Kconfig description

Since the paravirt spinlock optimizations went into the v3.12 kernel
we have a very good performance benefit for paravirtualized KVM / Xen
kernels. Also we no longer suffer from 5% side effect on native
kernel that is mentioned in the Kconfig entry.

So update the Kconfig entry accordingly.
