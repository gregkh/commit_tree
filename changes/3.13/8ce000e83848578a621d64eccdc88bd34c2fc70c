perf tools: Remove unneeded include

There is no point in sort.h including itself.

The include was added when the file was created, in commit "perf tools:
Create util/sort.and use it" (dd68ada2d) and added a include to "sort.h"
in lot of files (all the files that started using the file). It was
probably added by mistake on sort.h too.
