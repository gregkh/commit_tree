s390/bitops: rename find_first_bit_left() to find_first_bit_inv()

find_first_bit_left() and friends have nothing to do with the normal
LSB0 bit numbering for big endian machines used in Linux (least
significant bit has bit number 0).
Instead they use MSB0 bit numbering, where the most signficant bit has
bit number 0. So rename find_first_bit_left() and friends to
find_first_bit_inv(), to avoid any confusion.
Also provide inv versions of set_bit, clear_bit and test_bit.

This also removes the confusing use of e.g. set_bit() in airq.c which
uses a "be_to_le" bit number conversion, which could imply that instead
set_bit_le() could be used. But that is entirely wrong since the _le
bitops variant uses yet another bit numbering scheme.
