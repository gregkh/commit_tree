audit_alloc: clear TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT if !audit_context

If audit_filter_task() nacks the new thread it makes sense
to clear TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT which can be copied from parent
by dup_task_struct().

A wrong TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT is not really bad but it triggers
the "slow" audit paths in entry.S to ensure the task can not
miss audit_syscall_*() calls, this is pointless if the task
has no ->audit_context.
