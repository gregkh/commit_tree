sched: Extract the basic add/sub preempt_count modifiers

Rewrite the preempt_count macros in order to extract the 3 basic
preempt_count value modifiers:

  __preempt_count_add()
  __preempt_count_sub()

and the new:

  __preempt_count_dec_and_test()

And since we're at it anyway, replace the unconventional
$op_preempt_count names with the more conventional preempt_count_$op.

Since these basic operators are equivalent to the previous _notrace()
variants, do away with the _notrace() versions.
