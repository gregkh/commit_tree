n_tty: Protect minimum_to_wake reset for concurrent readers

With multiple, concurrent readers (each waiting to acquire the
atomic_read_lock mutex), a departing reader may mistakenly reset
minimum_to_wake after a new reader has already set a new value.

Protect the minimum_to_wake reset with the atomic_read_lock critical
section.
