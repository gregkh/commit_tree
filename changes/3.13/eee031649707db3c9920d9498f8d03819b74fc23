kobject: introduce kobj_completion

A common way to handle kobject lifetimes in embedded in objects with
different lifetime rules is to pair the kobject with a struct completion.

This introduces a kobj_completion structure that can be used in place
of the pairing, along with several convenience functions for
initialization, release, and put-and-wait.
