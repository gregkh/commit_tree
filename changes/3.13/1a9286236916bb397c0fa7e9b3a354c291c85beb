misc: mic: Suppress memory space sparse warnings

MIC card and host drivers are able to use virtio over the PCIe bus by
treating ioremap return values for the prefetchable BARs as pointers,
effectively treating I/O memory the same as system memory. However this
results in sparse warnings. Knowing that these warnings do not point to
a functional issue, this patch suppresses these warnings.
