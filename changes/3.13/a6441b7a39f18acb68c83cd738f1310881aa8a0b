netfilter: synproxy: send mss option to backend

When the synproxy_parse_options is called on the client ack the mss
option will not be present. Consequently mss wont be included in the
backend syn packet, which falls back to 536 bytes mss.

Therefore XT_SYNPROXY_OPT_MSS is explicitly flagged when recovering mss
value from cookie.
