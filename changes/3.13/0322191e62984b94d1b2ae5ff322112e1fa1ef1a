mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: add sd3.0 SDR clock tuning support

Freescale i.MX6Q/DL uSDHC clock tuning progress is a little different from
the standard tuning process defined in host controller spec v3.0.
Thus we use platform_execute_tuning instead of standard sdhci tuning.

The main difference are:
1) not only generate Buffer Read Ready interrupt when tuning is performing.
   It generates all other DATA interrupts like the normal data command.
2) SDHCI_CTRL_EXEC_TUNING is not automatically cleared by HW,
   instead it's controlled by SW.
3) SDHCI_CTRL_TUNED_CLK is not automatically set by HW,
   it's controlled by SW.
4) the clock delay for every tuning is set by SW.
