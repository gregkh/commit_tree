Intel MIC Card Driver Changes for Virtio Devices.

This patch introduces the card "Virtio over PCIe" interface for
Intel MIC. It allows virtio drivers on the card to communicate with their
user space backends on the host via a device page. Ring 3 apps on the host
can add, remove and configure virtio devices. A thin MIC specific
virtio_config_ops is implemented which is borrowed heavily from previous
similar implementations in lguest and s390 @
drivers/lguest/lguest_device.c
drivers/s390/kvm/kvm_virtio.c
