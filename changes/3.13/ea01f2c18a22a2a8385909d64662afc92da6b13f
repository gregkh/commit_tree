iio: pressure-core: st: Allow for number of channels to vary

At the moment the number of channels specified is dictated by the first
sensor supported by the driver. As we add support for more sensors this
is likely to vary. Instead of using the ARRAY_SIZE() of the LPS331AP's
channel specifier we'll use a new adaptable 'struct st_sensors' element
instead.
