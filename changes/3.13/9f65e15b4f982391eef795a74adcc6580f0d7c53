i40e: Move rings from pointer to array to array of pointers

Allocate the queue pairs individually instead of as a group.  This
allows for much easier queue management as it is possible to dynamically
resize the queues without having to free and allocate the entire block.

Ease statistic collection by treating Tx/Rx queue pairs as a single
unit.  Each pair is allocated together and starts with a Tx queue and
ends with an Rx queue.  By ordering them this way it is possible to know
the Rx offset based on a pointer to the Tx queue.
