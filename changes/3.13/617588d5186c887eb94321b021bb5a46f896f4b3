locks: introduce new FL_DELEG lock flag

For now FL_DELEG is just a synonym for FL_LEASE.  So this patch doesn't
change behavior.

Next we'll modify break_lease to treat FL_DELEG leases differently, to
account for the fact that NFSv4 delegations should be broken in more
situations than Windows oplocks.
