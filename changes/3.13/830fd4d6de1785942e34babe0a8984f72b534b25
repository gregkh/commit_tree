    ARM: mm: Correct virt_to_phys patching for 64 bit physical addresses

introduced a __ARMEB__ macro usage in a new place, but missed the second
underscore. So correcting it here.

Also a explicit .align keyword is needed for the label with .long
data-type to be aligned on the 4 byte boundary. Otherwise this can
cause problem for thumb2 build. So adding it here.
