Revert "sysfs: handle duplicate removal attempts in sysfs_remove_group()"

This reverts commit 54d71145a4548330313ca664a4a009772fe8b7dd.

The root cause of these "inverted" sysfs removals have now been found,
so there is no need for this patch.  Keep this functionality around so
that this type of error doesn't show up in driver code again.
