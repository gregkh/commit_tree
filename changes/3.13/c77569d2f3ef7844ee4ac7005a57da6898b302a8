n_tty: Fix 4096-byte canonical reads

Although the maximum allowable canonical line is specified to
be 255 bytes (MAX_CANON), the practical limit has actually been
the size of the line discipline read buffer (N_TTY_BUF_SIZE == 4096).

Commit 32f13521ca68bc624ff6effc77f308a52b038bf0,
n_tty: Line copy to user buffer in canonical mode, limited the
line copy to 4095 bytes. With a completely full line discipline
read buffer and a userspace buffer > 4095, _no_ data was copied,
and the read() syscall returned 0, indicating EOF.

Fix the interval arithmetic to compute the correct number of bytes
to copy to userspace in the range [1..4096].
