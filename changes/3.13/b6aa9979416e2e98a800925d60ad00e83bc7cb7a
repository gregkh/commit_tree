tools/perf/build: Add feature check core code

Start the split-out of the feature check code by adding a list of features to be
tested, and rules to process that list by building its matching feature-check
file in config/feature-checks/test-<feature>.c.

Add 'hello' as the initial feature.

This structure will allow us to build split-out feature checks in parallel and
thus speed up feature detection dramatically.

No change in functionality: no feature check is used by the build rules yet.
