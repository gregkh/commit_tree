Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-s3c2410 suspend"

This reverts commit 19d339430403336f2f3c9d502db5f4e51fa21729.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
