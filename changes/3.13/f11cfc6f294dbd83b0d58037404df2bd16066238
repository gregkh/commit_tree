perf list: Show error if tracepoints not available

Tracepoints are not visible in "perf list" on Fedora 19 because regular
users have no permission to /sys/kernel/debug by default. Show an error
message so that the user knows about it instead of assuming that
tracepoints are not supported on the system.
