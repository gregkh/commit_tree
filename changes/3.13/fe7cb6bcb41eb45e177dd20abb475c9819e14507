[media] siano: Don't show debug messages as errors

At this bugzilla and similar ones:
   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60645
Those debug messages were seen as errors, but they're just debug
data, and are OK to appear on sms1100 and sms2270. Re-tag them
to appear only if debug is enabled.
