NTB: Fix NTB-RP Link Up

The Xeon NTB-RP setup, the transparent side does not get a link up/down
interrupt.  Since the presence of a NTB device on the transparent side
means that we have a NTB link up, we can work around the lack of an
interrupt by simply calling the link up function to notify the upper
layers.
