iommu: Change iommu driver to call unmap trace event

Change iommu driver to call unmap trace event. This iommu_map_unmap class
event can be enabled to trigger when iommu unmap iommu ops is called. Trace
information includes iova, physical address (map event only), and size.

Testing:
Added trace calls to iommu_prepare_identity_map() for testing some of the
conditions that are hard to trigger. Here is the trace from the testing:

       swapper/0-1     [003] ....     1.854102: unmap: IOMMU: iova=0x00000000cb800000 size=0x400
