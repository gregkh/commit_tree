drm/i915: s/HAS_L3_GPU_CACHE/HAS_L3_DPF

We'd only ever used this define to denote whether or not we have the
dynamic parity feature (DPF) and never to determine whether or not L3
exists. Baytrail is a good example of where L3 exists, and not DPF.

This patch provides clarify in the code for future use cases which might
want to actually query whether or not L3 exists.

v2: Add /* DPF == dynamic parity feature */
