sched: Assign correct scheduling domain to 'sd_llc'

Commit 42eb088e (sched: Avoid NULL dereference on sd_busy) corrected a NULL
dereference on sd_busy but the fix also altered what scheduling domain it
used for the 'sd_llc' percpu variable.

One impact of this is that a task selecting a runqueue may consider
idle CPUs that are not cache siblings as candidates for running.
Tasks are then running on CPUs that are not cache hot.

This was found through bisection where ebizzy threads were not seeing equal
performance and it looked like a scheduling fairness issue. This patch
mitigates but does not completely fix the problem on all machines tested
implying there may be an additional bug or a common root cause. Here are
the average range of performance seen by individual ebizzy threads. It
was tested on top of candidate patches related to x86 TLB range flushing.
