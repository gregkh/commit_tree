KVM: x86: Fix APIC map calculation after re-enabling

Update arch.apic_base before triggering recalculate_apic_map. Otherwise
the recalculation will work against the previous state of the APIC and
will fail to build the correct map when an APIC is hardware-enabled
again.

This fixes a regression of 1e08ec4a13.
