usb: gadget: s3c-hsotg: add multi count support

This patch adds Multi Count support. It adds few modifications:
- Fix s3c_hsotg_set_ep_maxpacket() function. Field wMaxPacketSize of endpoint
  descriptor is now splitted into maximum packet size value and number of
  additional transaction per microframe.
- Modify s3c_hsotg_write_fifo() function. It actually calculates transfer
  size, taking into account Multi Count value, which indicates number of
  transactions per microframe.
- Fix s3c_hsotg_start_req() function by setting number of packets to Multi
  Count field in DIEPTSIZ register for isochronous endpoints.
