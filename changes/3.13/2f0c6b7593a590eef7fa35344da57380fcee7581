sysfs: add sysfs_bin_read()

sysfs bin file handling will be merged into the regular file support.
This patch prepares the read path.

Copy fs/sysfs/bin.c::read() to fs/sysfs/file.c and make it use
sysfs_open_file instead of bin_buffer.  The function is identical copy
except for the use of sysfs_open_file.

The new function is added to sysfs_bin_operations.  This isn't used
yet but will eventually replace fs/sysfs/bin.c.
