alpha: Eliminate compiler warning from memset macro

Compiling with GCC 4.8 yields several instances of

crypto/vmac.c: In function ‘vmac_final’:
crypto/vmac.c:616:9: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]
  memset(&mac, 0, sizeof(vmac_t));
         ^
arch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:31:25: note: in definition of macro ‘memset’
     ? __builtin_memset((s),0,(n))          \
                         ^
Converting the macro to an inline function eliminates this problem.

However, doing only that causes problems with the GCC 3.x series.  The
inline function cannot be named "memset", as otherwise we wind up with
recursion via __builtin_memset.  Solve this by adjusting the symbols
such that __memset is the inline, and ___memset is the real function.
