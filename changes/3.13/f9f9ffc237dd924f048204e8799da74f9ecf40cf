sched: Avoid throttle_cfs_rq() racing with period_timer stopping

throttle_cfs_rq() doesn't check to make sure that period_timer is running,
and while update_curr/assign_cfs_runtime does, a concurrently running
period_timer on another cpu could cancel itself between this cpu's
update_curr and throttle_cfs_rq(). If there are no other cfs_rqs running
in the tg to restart the timer, this causes the cfs_rq to be stranded
forever.

Fix this by calling __start_cfs_bandwidth() in throttle if the timer is
inactive.

(Also add some sched_debug lines for cfs_bandwidth.)

Tested: make a run/sleep task in a cgroup, loop switching the cgroup
between 1ms/100ms quota and unlimited, checking for timer_active=0 and
throttled=1 as a failure. With the throttle_cfs_rq() change commented out
this fails, with the full patch it passes.
