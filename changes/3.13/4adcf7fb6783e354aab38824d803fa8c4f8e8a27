IB/ipath: Convert ipath_user_sdma_pin_pages() to use get_user_pages_fast()

ipath_user_sdma_queue_pkts() gets called with mmap_sem held for
writing.  Except for get_user_pages() deep down in
ipath_user_sdma_pin_pages() we don't seem to need mmap_sem at all.

Even more interestingly the function ipath_user_sdma_queue_pkts() (and
also ipath_user_sdma_coalesce() called somewhat later) call
copy_from_user() which can hit a page fault and we deadlock on trying
to get mmap_sem when handling that fault.  So just make
ipath_user_sdma_pin_pages() use get_user_pages_fast() and leave
mmap_sem locking for mm.

This deadlock has actually been observed in the wild when the node
is under memory pressure.
