usb: gadget: pxa25x_udc: fix deferred probe from __init

Move probe out of __init section and don't use platform_driver_probe
which cannot be used with deferred probing.

Since commit e9354576 ("gpiolib: Defer failed gpio requests by default")
this driver might return -EPROBE_DEFER if a gpio_request fails.
