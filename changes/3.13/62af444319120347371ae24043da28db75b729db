Bluetooth: Allow setting static address even if LE is disabled

Setting the static address does not depend on LE beeing enabled. It
only depends on a controller with LE support.

When depending on LE enabled this command becomes really complicated
since in case LE gets disabled, it would be required to clear the
static address and also its random address representation inside
the controller. With future support for private addresses such
complex setup should be avoided.
