driver/mtd/ifc: Read Status while programming NAND flash

as per controller description,
  "While programming a NAND flash, status read should never skipped.
   Because it may happen that a new command is issued to the NAND Flash,
   even when the device has not yet finished processing the previous request.
   This may result in unpredictable behaviour."

IFC controller never polls for R/B signal after command send. It just return
control to software. This behaviour may not occur with NAND flash access.
because new commands are sent after polling R/B signal. But it may happen
in scenario where GPCM-ASIC and NAND flash device are working simultaneously.

Update the controller driver to take care of this requirement
