kbuild: Increase kallsyms max symbol length

[AK: This seems like a ticking time bomb even without LTO,
so should be merged now. It causes very weird problems.
Thanks to Joe for tracking them down.]

With the added postfixes that LTO adds for local
symbols, the longest name in the kernel overflows
the namebuf[KSYM_NAME_LEN] array by two bytes.  That name is:
__pci_fixup_resumePCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKSPCI_DEVICE_ID_SERVERWORKS_HT1000SBquirk_disable_broadcom_boot_interrupt.1488004.672802

Double the max symbol name length.
