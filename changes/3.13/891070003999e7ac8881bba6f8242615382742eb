virtio: pm: use CONFIG_PM_SLEEP instead of CONFIG_PM

The freeze and restore functions defined in virtio drivers are used
for suspend and hibernate, so CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is more appropriate than
CONFIG_PM. This patch replace all CONFIG_PM with CONFIG_PM_SLEEP for
virtio drivers that implement freeze and restore callbacks.
