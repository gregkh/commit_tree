powerpc/8xx: Revert commit e0908085fc2391c85b85fb814ae1df377c8e0dcb

The commit e0908085fc2391c85b85fb814ae1df377c8e0dcb ("powerpc/8xx: Fix
regression introduced by cache coherency rewrite") is not needed
anymore.  The issue was because dcbst wrongly sets the store bit when
causing a DTLB error, but this is now fixed by commit
0a2ab51ffb8dfdf51402dcfb446629648c96bc78 ("powerpc/8xx: Fixup DAR from
buggy dcbX instructions.") which handles the buggy dcbx instructions on
data page faults on the 8xx.
