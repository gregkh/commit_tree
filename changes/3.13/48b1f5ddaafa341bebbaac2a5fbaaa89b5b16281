drm: do not set crtc enabled field twice

There is no need to set crtc->enabled field in
drm_crtc_helper_set_config. This is already done (and
properly restored in case of failure) in
drm_crtc_helper_set_mode that is called by
drm_crtc_helper_set_config. Doing it at only one
place makes restoration in case of failure easier.
