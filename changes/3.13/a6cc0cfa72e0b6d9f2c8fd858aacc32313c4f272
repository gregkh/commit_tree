net: Add layer 2 hardware acceleration operations for macvlan devices

Add a operations structure that allows a network interface to export
the fact that it supports package forwarding in hardware between
physical interfaces and other mac layer devices assigned to it (such
as macvlans). This operaions structure can be used by virtual mac
devices to bypass software switching so that forwarding can be done
in hardware more efficiently.
