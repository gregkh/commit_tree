[media] lirc_zilog: Don't use dynamic static allocation

Dynamic static allocation is evil, as Kernel stack is too low, and
ompilation complains about it on some archs:
	drivers/staging/media/lirc/lirc_zilog.c:967:1: warning: 'read' uses dynamic stack allocation [enabled by default]
Instead, let's enforce a limit for the buffer to be 64. That should
be more than enough.
