Revert "selinux: consider filesystem subtype in policies"

This reverts commit 102aefdda4d8275ce7d7100bc16c88c74272b260.

Tom London reports that it causes sync() to hang on Fedora rawhide:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1033965

and Josh Boyer bisected it down to this commit.  Reverting the commit in
the rawhide kernel fixes the problem.

Eric Paris root-caused it to incorrect subtype matching in that commit
breaking fuse, and has a tentative patch, but by now we're better off
retrying this in 3.14 rather than playing with it any more.
