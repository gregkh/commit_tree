sysfs: use transient write buffer

There isn't much to be gained by keeping around kernel buffer while a
file is open especially as the read path planned to be converted to
use seq_file and won't use the buffer.  This patch makes
sysfs_write_file() use per-write transient buffer instead of
sysfs_open_file->page.

This simplifies the write path, enables removing sysfs_open_file->page
once read path is updated and will help merging bin file write path
which already requires the use of a transient buffer due to a locking
order issue.

As the function comments of flush_write_buffer() and
sysfs_write_buffer() are being updated anyway, reformat them so that
they're more conventional.

v2: Use min_t() instead of min() in sysfs_write_file() to avoid build
    warning on arm.  Reported by build test robot.
