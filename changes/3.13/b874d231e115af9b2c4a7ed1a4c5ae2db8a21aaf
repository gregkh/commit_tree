drbd: Fix an connection drop issue after enabling allow-two-primaries

Since drbd-8.4.0 it is possible to change the allow-two-primaries
network option while the connection is established.

The sequence code used to partially order packets from the
data socket with packets from the meta-data socket, still assued
that the allow-two-primaries option is constant while the
connection is established.

I.e.
On a node that has the RESOLVE_CONFLICTS bits set, after enabling
allow-two-primaries, when receiving the next data packet it timed out
while waiting for the necessary packets on the data socket to arrive
(wait_for_and_update_peer_seq() function).

Fixed that by always tracking the sequence number, but only waiting
for it if allow-two-primaries is set.
