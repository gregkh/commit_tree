xen-netback: add support for IPv6 checksum offload from guest

For performance of VM to VM traffic on a single host it is better to avoid
calculation of TCP/UDP checksum in the sending frontend. To allow this this
patch adds the code necessary to set up partial checksum for IPv6 packets
and xenstore flag feature-ipv6-csum-offload to advertise that fact to
frontends.
