target: Drop left-over se_lun->lun_cmd_list shutdown code

Now with percpu refcounting for se_lun in place, go ahead and drop
the legacy per se_cmd accounting for se_lun shutdown.

This includes __transport_clear_lun_from_sessions(), the associated
transport_lun_wait_for_tasks() logic, along with a handful of now
unused se_cmd structure members and ->transport_state bits.
