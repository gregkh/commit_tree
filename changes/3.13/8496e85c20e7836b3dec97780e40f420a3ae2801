PCI / tg3: Give up chip reset and carrier loss handling if PCI device is not present

Modify tg3_chip_reset() and tg3_close() to check if the PCI network
adapter device is accessible at all in order to skip poking it or
trying to handle a carrier loss in vain when that's not the case.
Introduce a special PCI helper function pci_device_is_present()
for this purpose.

Of course, this uncovers the lack of the appropriate RTNL locking
in tg3_suspend() and tg3_resume(), so add that locking in there
too.

These changes prevent tg3 from burning a CPU at 100% load level for
solid several seconds after the Thunderbolt link is disconnected from
a Matrox DS1 docking station.
