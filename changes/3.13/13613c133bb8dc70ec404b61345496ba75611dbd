usb: gadget: s3c-hsotg: fix maxpacket size

This patch changes ep maxpacket value from 512 to 1024, because it's needed
to handle interupt and isochronous endpoints in high-speed mode. This change
doesn't affect on driver functioning, because fifo size (3072) is still enough
for the maximum transaction payload (3*1024 for high-speed high-bandwidtch
endpoints).
