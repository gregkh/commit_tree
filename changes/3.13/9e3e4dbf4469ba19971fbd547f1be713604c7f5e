KVM: nVMX: Replace kvm_set_cr0 with vmx_set_cr0 in load_vmcs12_host_state

kvm_set_cr0 performs checks on the state transition that may prevent
loading L1's cr0. For now we rely on the hardware to catch invalid
states loaded by L1 into its VMCS. Still, consistency checks on the host
state part of the VMCS on guest entry will have to be improved later on.
