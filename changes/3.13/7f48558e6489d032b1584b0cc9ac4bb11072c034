cifs: Send a logoff request before removing a smb session

Send a smb session logoff request before removing smb session off of the list.
On a signed smb session, remvoing a session off of the list before sending
a logoff request results in server returning an error for lack of
smb signature.

Never seen an error during smb logoff, so as per MS-SMB2 3.2.5.1,
not sure how an error during logoff should be retried. So for now,
if a server returns an error to a logoff request, log the error and
remove the session off of the list.
