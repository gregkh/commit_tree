mm: Account for a THP NUMA hinting update as one PTE update

A THP PMD update is accounted for as 512 pages updated in vmstat.  This is
large difference when estimating the cost of automatic NUMA balancing and
can be misleading when comparing results that had collapsed versus split
THP. This patch addresses the accounting issue.
