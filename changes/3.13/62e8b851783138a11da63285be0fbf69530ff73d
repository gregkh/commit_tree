mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Allocate data buffer on detected flash size

This commit replaces the currently hardcoded buffer size, by a
dynamic detection scheme. First a small 256 bytes buffer is allocated
so the device can be detected (using READID and friends commands).

After detection, this buffer is released and a new buffer is allocated
to acommodate the page size plus out-of-band size.
