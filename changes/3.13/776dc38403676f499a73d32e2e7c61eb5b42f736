drm/tegra: Move subdevice infrastructure to host1x

The Tegra DRM driver currently uses some infrastructure to defer the DRM
core initialization until all required devices have registered. The same
infrastructure can potentially be used by any other driver that requires
more than a single sub-device of the host1x module.

Make the infrastructure more generic and keep only the DRM specific code
in the DRM part of the driver. Eventually this will make it easy to move
the DRM driver part back to the DRM subsystem.
