net: rose: restore old recvmsg behavior

recvmsg handler in net/rose/af_rose.c performs size-check ->msg_namelen.

After commit f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c
(net: rework recvmsg handler msg_name and msg_namelen logic), we now
always take the else branch due to namelen being initialized to 0.

Digging in netdev-vger-cvs git repo shows that msg_namelen was
initialized with a fixed-size since at least 1995, so the else branch
was never taken.

Compile tested only.
