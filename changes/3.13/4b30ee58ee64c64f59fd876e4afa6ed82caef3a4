sysfs: remove ktype->namespace() invocations in symlink code

There's no reason for sysfs to be calling ktype->namespace().  It is
backwards, obfuscates what's going on and unnecessarily tangles two
separate layers.

There are two places where symlink code calls ktype->namespace().

* sysfs_do_create_link_sd() calls it to find out the namespace tag of
  the target directory.  Unless symlinking races with cross-namespace
  renaming, this equals @target_sd->s_ns.

* sysfs_rename_link() uses it to find out the new namespace to rename
  to and the new namespace can be different from the existing one.
  The function is renamed to sysfs_rename_link_ns() with an explicit
  @ns argument and the ktype->namespace() invocation is shifted to the
  device layer.

While this patch replaces ktype->namespace() invocation with the
recorded result in @target_sd, this shouldn't result in any behvior
difference.
