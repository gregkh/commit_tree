intel_menlow: convert acpi_get_handle() to acpi_has_method()

acpi_has_method() is a new ACPI API introduced to check
the existence of an ACPI control method.

It can be used to replace acpi_get_handle() in the case that
1. the calling function doesn't need the ACPI handle of the control method.
and
2. the calling function doesn't care the reason why the method is unavailable.

Convert acpi_get_handle() to acpi_has_method()
in drivers/platform/x86/intel_menlow.c in this patch.
