mlx5: Support communicating arbitrary host page size to firmware

Connect-IB firmware requires 4K pages to be communicated with the
driver. This patch breaks larger pages to 4K units to enable support
for architectures utilizing larger page size, such as PowerPC.  This
patch also fixes several places that referred to PAGE_SHIFT instead of
explicit 12 which is the inherent page shift on Connect-IB.
