[SCSI] bnx2fc: Fixed a SCSI CMD cmpl race condition between ABTS and CLEANUP

In the case when a SCSI_CMD times out, bnx2fc will initiate the sending of the
ABTS.  However, if the SCSI layer's SCSI command timer also times out, it'll
instantiate a task abort of the same xid.

The race condition this patch tries to fix is as follows:

SCSI_CMD timeout (20s)
thread 1                   thread 2
send ABTS
rx ABTS cmpl
                           task abort_eh
                           explicit LOGO since ABTS was engaged
                           CLEANUP cmpl
SCSI_CMD cmpl (ABTS cmpl)
instantiate RRQ
wait 10s
attempt to send RRQ (because of LOGO, it wouldn't continue)

Note that there is no call to scsi_done for this SCSI_CMD cmpletion
in this path.

The patch changes the path of execution to call scsi_done immediately
instead of instantiating the RRQ.
