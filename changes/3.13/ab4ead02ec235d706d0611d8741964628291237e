ftrace/x86: skip over the breakpoint for ftrace caller

In commit 8a4d0a687a59 "ftrace: Use breakpoint method to update ftrace
caller", we choose to use breakpoint method to update the ftrace
caller. But we also need to skip over the breakpoint in function
ftrace_int3_handler() for them. Otherwise weird things would happen.
