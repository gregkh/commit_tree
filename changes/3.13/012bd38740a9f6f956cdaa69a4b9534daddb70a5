be2net: Fix unconditional enabling of Rx interface options

The driver currently requests the firmware to enable rx_interface options
without considering if the interface was created with that capability.
This could cause commands to firmware to fail.

To avoid this, enable only those options on an interface if the interface
was created with that capability.
