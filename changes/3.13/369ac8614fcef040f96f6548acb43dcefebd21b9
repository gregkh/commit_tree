mmc: dw_mmc: don't queue up a card detect at slot startup

The MMC subsystem handles looking for a card at probe time. Queuing up our
own can race with the rest of the MMC subsystem and cause problems if we
get unlucky with timing. Just remove driver own detection triggering.  While
progressing the request from 'mmc_rescan', if 'dw_mci_work_routine_card'
routine is activated, it will cancel the current request. The problem case
is that 'mmc_rescan' is prior to 'dw_mci_work_routine_card' from host own.
Specifically, the following message shows the detection problem in driver's
probing. It would get an err -123 (-ENOMEDIUM) during probe.
