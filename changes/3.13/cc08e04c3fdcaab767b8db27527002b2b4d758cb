x86: Export 'boot_cpu_physical_apicid' to modules

Commit 9ebddac7ea2a "ACPI, x86: Fix extended error log driver to depend on
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC" fixed a build error when CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC was not
selected and !CONFIG_SMP.

However, since CONFIG_ACPI_EXTLOG is tristate, there is a second build error:

  ERROR: "boot_cpu_physical_apicid" [drivers/acpi/acpi_extlog.ko] undefined!

The symbol needs to be exported for it to be available.
