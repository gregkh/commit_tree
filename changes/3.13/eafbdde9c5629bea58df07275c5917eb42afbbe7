rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Fix more pointer arithmetic errors

This driver uses a number of macros to get and set various fields in the
RX and TX descriptors. To work correctly, a u8 pointer to the descriptor
must be used; however, in some cases a descriptor structure pointer is used
instead. In addition, a duplicated statement is removed.
