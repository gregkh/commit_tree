NFS: Handle SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED

With the advent of NFSv4 sessions in NFSv4.1 and following, a "lease
moved" condition is reported differently than it is in NFSv4.0.

NFSv4 minor version 0 servers return an error status code,
NFS4ERR_LEASE_MOVED, to signal that a lease has moved.  This error
causes the whole compound operation to fail.  Normal compounds
against this server continue to fail until the client performs
migration recovery on the migrated share.

Minor version 1 and later servers assert a bit flag in the reply to
a compound's SEQUENCE operation to signal LEASE_MOVED.  This is not
a fatal condition: operations against this server continue normally.
The server asserts this flag until the client performs migration
recovery on the migrated share.

Note that servers MUST NOT return NFS4ERR_LEASE_MOVED to NFSv4
clients not using NFSv4.0.

After the server asserts any of the sr_status_flags in the SEQUENCE
operation in a typical compound, our client initiates standard lease
recovery.  For NFSv4.1+, a stand-alone SEQUENCE operation is
performed to discover what recovery is needed.

If SEQ4_STATUS_LEASE_MOVED is asserted in this stand-alone SEQUENCE
operation, our client attempts to discover which FSIDs have been
migrated, and then performs migration recovery on each.
