[media] bttv: don't setup the controls if there are no video devices

The no_video flag was checked in all other cases except one. Calling
v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup() if no_video is 1 will crash.
This wasn't noticed before since there are only two card types that
set no_video to 1, so this type of hardware is quite rare.
