ARM: 7866/1: include: asm: use 'long long' instead of 'u64' within atomic.h

atomic* value is signed value, and atomic* functions need also process
signed value (parameter value, and return value), so 32-bit arm need
use 'long long' instead of 'u64'.

After replacement, it will also fix a bug for atomic64_add_negative():
"u64 is never less than 0".

The modifications are:

  in vim, use "1,% s/\<u64\>/long long/g" command.
  remove '__aligned(8)' which is useless for 64-bit.
  be sure of 80 column limitation after replacement.
