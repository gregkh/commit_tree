batman-adv: consider network coding overhead when calculating required mtu

The module prints a warning when the MTU on the hard interface is too
small to transfer payload traffic without fragmentation. The required
MTU is calculated based on the encapsulation header size. If network
coding is compild into the module its header size is taken into
account as well.
