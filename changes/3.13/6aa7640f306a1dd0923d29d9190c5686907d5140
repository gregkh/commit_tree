GFS2: optimize rbm_from_block wrt bi_start

In function gfs2_rbm_from_block, it starts by checking if the block
falls within the first bitmap. It does so by checking if the rbm's
offset is less than (rbm->bi->bi_start + rbm->bi->bi_len) * GFS2_NBBY.
However, the first bitmap will always have bi_start==0. Therefore
this is an unnecessary calculation in a function that gets called
billions of times. This patch removes the reference to bi_start.
