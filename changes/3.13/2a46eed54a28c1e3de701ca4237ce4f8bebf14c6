Wrong page freed on preallocate_pmds() failure exit

Note that pmds[i] is simply uninitialized at that point...

Granted, it's very hard to hit (you need split page locks *and*
kmalloc(sizeof(spinlock_t), GFP_KERNEL) failing), but the code is
obviously bogus.

Introduced by commit 09ef4939850a ("x86: add missed
pgtable_pmd_page_ctor/dtor calls for preallocated pmds")
