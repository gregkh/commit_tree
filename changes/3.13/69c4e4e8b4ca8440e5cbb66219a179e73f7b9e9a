Bluetooth: Fix responding to invalid L2CAP signaling commands

When we have an LE link we should not respond to any data on the BR/EDR
L2CAP signaling channel (0x0001) and vice-versa when we have a BR/EDR
link we should not respond to LE L2CAP (CID 0x0005) signaling commands.
This patch fixes this issue by checking for a valid link type and
ignores data if it is wrong.
