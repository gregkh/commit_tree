intel_mid: Move platform device setups to their own platform_<device>.* files

As Intel rolling out more SoC's after Moorestown, we need to
re-structure the code in a way that is backward compatible and easy to
expand. This patch implements a flexible way to support multiple boards
and devices.

This patch does not add any new functional support. It just refactors
the existing code to increase the modularity and decrease the code
duplication for supporting multiple soc's and boards.

Currently intel-mid.c has both board and soc related code in one file.
This patch moves the board related code to new files and let linker
script to create SFI devite table following this:

1. Move the SFI device specific code to
   arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device-libs/platform_<device>.*
   A new device file is added for every supported device. This code will
   get conditionally compiled by using corresponding device driver
   CONFIG option.

2. Move the device_ids location to .x86_intel_mid_dev.init section by
   using new sfi_device() macro.

This patch was based on previous code from Sathyanarayanan Kuppuswamy.
