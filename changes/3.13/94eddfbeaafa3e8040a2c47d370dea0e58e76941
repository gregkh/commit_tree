blk-mq: ensure that we set REQ_IO_STAT so diskstats work

If disk stats are enabled on the queue, a request needs to
be marked with REQ_IO_STAT for accounting to be active on
that request. This fixes an issue with virtio-blk not
showing up in /proc/diskstats after the conversion to
blk-mq.

Add QUEUE_FLAG_MQ_DEFAULT, setting stats and same cpu-group
completion on by default.
