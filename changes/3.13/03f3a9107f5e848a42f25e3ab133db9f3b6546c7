hv: use dev_groups for device attributes

This patch is the first in a series that moves the hv bus code to use the
dev_groups field instead of dev_attrs, as dev_attrs is going away in future
kernel releases.

It moves the id sysfs file to the dev_groups structure, and creates the needed
show/store functions, instead of relying on one "universal" function for this.
By doing this, it removes the need for this to be in a temporary structure.
