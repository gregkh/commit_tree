NFSv4: Fix state reference counting in _nfs4_opendata_reclaim_to_nfs4_state

Currently, if the call to nfs_refresh_inode fails, then we end up leaking
a reference count, due to the call to nfs4_get_open_state.
While we're at it, replace nfs4_get_open_state with a simple call to
atomic_inc(); there is no need to do a full lookup of the struct nfs_state
since it is passed as an argument in the struct nfs4_opendata, and
is already assigned to the variable 'state'.
