KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Support POWER6 compatibility mode on POWER7

This enables us to use the Processor Compatibility Register (PCR) on
POWER7 to put the processor into architecture 2.05 compatibility mode
when running a guest.  In this mode the new instructions and registers
that were introduced on POWER7 are disabled in user mode.  This
includes all the VSX facilities plus several other instructions such
as ldbrx, stdbrx, popcntw, popcntd, etc.

To select this mode, we have a new register accessible through the
set/get_one_reg interface, called KVM_REG_PPC_ARCH_COMPAT.  Setting
this to zero gives the full set of capabilities of the processor.
Setting it to one of the "logical" PVR values defined in PAPR puts
the vcpu into the compatibility mode for the corresponding
architecture level.  The supported values are:

0x0f000002	Architecture 2.05 (POWER6)
0x0f000003	Architecture 2.06 (POWER7)
0x0f100003	Architecture 2.06+ (POWER7+)

Since the PCR is per-core, the architecture compatibility level and
the corresponding PCR value are stored in the struct kvmppc_vcore, and
are therefore shared between all vcpus in a virtual core.
