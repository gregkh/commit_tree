tipc: make bearer and media naming consistent

TIPC 'bearer' exists as an abstract concept, while 'media'
is deemed a specific implementation of a bearer, such as Ethernet
or Infiniband media. When a component inside TIPC wants to control
a specific media, it only needs to access the generic bearer API
to achieve this. However, in the current media implementations,
the 'bearer' name is also extensively used in media specific
function and variable names.

This may create confusion, so we choose to replace the term 'bearer'
with 'media' in all function names, variable names, and prefixes
where this is what really is meant.

Note that this change is cosmetic only, and no runtime behaviour
changes are made here.
