macvtap: fix tx_dropped counting error

After commit 8ffab51b3dfc54876f145f15b351c41f3f703195
(macvlan: lockless tx path), tx stat counter were converted to percpu stat
structure. So we need use to this also for tx_dropped in macvtap. Otherwise, the
management won't notice the dropping packet in macvtap tx path.
