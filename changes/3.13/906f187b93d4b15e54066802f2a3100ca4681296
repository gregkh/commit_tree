Revert "ACPI / video: Ignore BIOS initial backlight value for HP 250 G1"

This reverts commit e37f14a5fb85522f3bbf88ece6134c4e610ed598.

It turned out other systems also share the same problem with bug 63111
so I made a patch to catch initial brightness level 0 problem. With that
patch applied, we do not need to place HP 250 G1 in DMI table.
