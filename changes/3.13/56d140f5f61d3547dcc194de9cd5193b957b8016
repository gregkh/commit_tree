Btrfs: print bytenr instead of page pointer in check-int

The page pointer information was useless. The bytenr is what you
want when you search for submitted write bios.

Additionally, a new bit in the print mask is added that allows
to selectively enable the check-int submit_bio verbose mode. Before,
the global verbose mode had to be enabled leading to many million
useless lines in the kernel log.

And a comment is added that explains that LOG_BUF_SHIFT needs to
be set to a really high value.
