RDMA/cma: Set IBoE SL (user-priority) by egress map when using vlans

On top of commit 366cddb40 "IB/rdma_cm: TOS <=> UP mapping for IBoE", add
support for case vlan egress map is used.

When the IBoE session is being set over a vlan, inherit the socket priority
to vlan priority mapping which was configured for the vlan device egress map.
