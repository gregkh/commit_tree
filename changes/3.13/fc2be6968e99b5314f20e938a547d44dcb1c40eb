perf symbols: Add new option --ignore-vmlinux for perf top

Running "perf top" on a machine with possibly invalid or non-matching
vmlinux at the various places results in no symbol resolving despite
/proc/kallsyms being present and valid.

Add a new option --ignore-vmlinux to explicitly indicate that we do not
want to use these kernels and just use what we have (kallsyms).
