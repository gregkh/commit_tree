mac80211: implement STA CSA for drivers using channel contexts

Limit the current implementation to a single channel context used by
a single vif, thereby avoiding multi-vif/channel complexities.

Reuse the main function from AP CSA code, but move a portion out in
order to fit the STA scenario.

Add a new mac80211 HW flag so we don't break devices that don't support
channel switch with channel-contexts. The new behavior will be opt-in.
