ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: AM335x: runtime register update

Most of IP's in AM335x is present on AM43x and so in those cases both
will use same hwmod database (except for a few cases where clock related
details differ), but there is difference w.r.t register offset between
these. Update register offsets at runtime based on the SoC detected to
help in sharing otherwise same hwmod.
