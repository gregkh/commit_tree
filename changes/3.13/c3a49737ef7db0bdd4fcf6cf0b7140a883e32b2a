drm: move device unregistration into drm_dev_unregister()

Analog to drm_dev_register(), we now provide drm_dev_unregister() which
does the reverse. drm_dev_put() is still in place and combines the calls
to drm_dev_unregister() and drm_dev_free() so buses don't have to change.

*_get() and *_put() are used for reference-counting in the kernel.
However, drm_dev_put() definitely does not do any kind of ref-counting.
Hence, use the more appropriate *_register(), *_unregister(), *_alloc()
and *_free() names.
