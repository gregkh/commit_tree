s390/bitops: use flogr instruction to implement __ffs, ffs, __fls, fls and fls64

Since z9 109 we have the flogr instruction which can be used to implement
optimized versions of __ffs, ffs, __fls, fls and fls64.
So implement and use them, instead of the generic variants.
This reduces the size of the kernel image (defconfig, -march=z9-109)
by 19,648 bytes.
