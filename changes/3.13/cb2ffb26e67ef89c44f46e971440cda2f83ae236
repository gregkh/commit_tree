cuse: add fix minor number to /dev/cuse

This allows udev (or more recently systemd-tmpfiles) to create /dev/cuse on
boot, in the same way as /dev/fuse is currently created, and the corresponding
module to be loaded on first access.

The corresponding functionalty was introduced for fuse in commit 578454f.
