Bluetooth: Add the definition and structure for Delete Reserved LT_ADDR

The Delete_Reserved_LT_ADDR command requests that the BR/EDR
Controller cancel the reservation for a specific LT_ADDR reserved for the
purposes of Connectionless Slave Broadcast.

The Core Spec Addendum 4 adds this command in part B Connectionless
Slave Broadcast.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 4 - Page 92

"7.3.87 Delete Reserved LT_ADDR Command [New Section]
...
If the LT_ADDR indicated in the LT_ADDR parameter is not reserved by the
BR/EDR Controller, it shall return the Unknown Connection Identifier (0x02)
error code.
If connectionless slave broadcast mode is still active, then the Controller
shall return the Command Disallowed (0x0C) error code."
