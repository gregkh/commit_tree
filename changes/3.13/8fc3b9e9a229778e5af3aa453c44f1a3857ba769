virtio_net: fix error handling for mergeable buffers

Eric Dumazet noticed that if we encounter an error
when processing a mergeable buffer, we don't
dequeue all of the buffers from this packet,
the result is almost sure to be loss of networking.

Jason Wang noticed that we also leak a page and that we don't decrement
the rq buf count, so we won't repost buffers (a resource leak).

Fix both issues.
