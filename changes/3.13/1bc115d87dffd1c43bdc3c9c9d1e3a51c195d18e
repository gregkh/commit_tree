mm: numa: Scan pages with elevated page_mapcount

Currently automatic NUMA balancing is unable to distinguish between false
shared versus private pages except by ignoring pages with an elevated
page_mapcount entirely. This avoids shared pages bouncing between the
nodes whose task is using them but that is ignored quite a lot of data.

This patch kicks away the training wheels in preparation for adding support
for identifying shared/private pages is now in place. The ordering is so
that the impact of the shared/private detection can be easily measured. Note
that the patch does not migrate shared, file-backed within vmas marked
VM_EXEC as these are generally shared library pages. Migrating such pages
is not beneficial as there is an expectation they are read-shared between
caches and iTLB and iCache pressure is generally low.
