target/file: Update hw_max_sectors based on current block_size

This patch allows FILEIO to update hw_max_sectors based on the current
max_bytes_per_io.  This is required because vfs_[writev,readv]() can accept
a maximum of 2048 iovecs per call, so the enforced hw_max_sectors really
needs to be calculated based on block_size.

This addresses a >= v3.5 bug where block_size=512 was rejecting > 1M
sized I/O requests, because FD_MAX_SECTORS was hardcoded to 2048 for
the block_size=4096 case.

(v2: Use max_bytes_per_io instead of ->update_hw_max_sectors)
