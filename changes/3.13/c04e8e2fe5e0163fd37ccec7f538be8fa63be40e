arm64: allow ioremap_cache() to use existing RAM mappings

Some drivers (ACPI notably) use ioremap_cache() to map an area which could
either be outside of kernel RAM or in an already mapped reserved area of
RAM. To avoid aliases with different caching attributes, ioremap() does
not allow RAM to be remapped. But for ioremap_cache(), the existing kernel
mapping may be used.
