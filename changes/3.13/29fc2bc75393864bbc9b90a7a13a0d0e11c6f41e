printk: pr_debug_ratelimited: check state first to reduce "callbacks suppressed" messages

pr_debug_ratelimited should be coded similarly to dev_dbg_ratelimited
to reduce the "callbacks suppressed" messages.

Add #include <linux/dynamic_debug.h> to printk.h. Unfortunately, this
new #include must be after the prototype/declaration of function printk.

It may be better to split out these _ratelimited declarations into
a separate file one day.

Any use of these pr_<foo>_ratelimited functions must also have another
specific #include <ratelimited.h>.  Most users have this done indirectly
via #include <linux/kernel.h>

printk.h may not #include <linux/ratelimit.h> as it causes circular
dependencies and compilation failures.
