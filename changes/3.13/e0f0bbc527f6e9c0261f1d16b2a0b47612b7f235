kvm: Create non-coherent DMA registeration

We currently use some ad-hoc arch variables tied to legacy KVM device
assignment to manage emulation of instructions that depend on whether
non-coherent DMA is present.  Create an interface for this, adapting
legacy KVM device assignment and adding VFIO via the KVM-VFIO device.
For now we assume that non-coherent DMA is possible any time we have a
VFIO group.  Eventually an interface can be developed as part of the
VFIO external user interface to query the coherency of a group.
