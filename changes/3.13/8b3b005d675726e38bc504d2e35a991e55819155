x86, build: Pass in additional -mno-mmx, -mno-sse options

In checkin

    5551a34e5aea x86-64, build: Always pass in -mno-sse

we unconditionally added -mno-sse to the main build, to keep newer
compilers from generating SSE instructions from autovectorization.
However, this did not extend to the special environments
(arch/x86/boot, arch/x86/boot/compressed, and arch/x86/realmode/rm).
Add -mno-sse to the compiler command line for these environments, and
add -mno-mmx to all the environments as well, as we don't want a
compiler to generate MMX code either.

This patch also removes a $(cc-option) call for -m32, since we have
long since stopped supporting compilers too old for the -m32 option,
and in fact hardcode it in other places in the Makefiles.
