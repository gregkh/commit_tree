iio:kfifo: Set update_needed to false after allocating a new buffer

update_needed is used to decide whether the kfifo buffer needs to be
re-allocated. It is set to true whenever the size of the buffer is changed. It
is never set to false though, causing the buffer to always be re-allocated.
Setting update_needed to false after the new buffer has been allocated fixes the
problem.
