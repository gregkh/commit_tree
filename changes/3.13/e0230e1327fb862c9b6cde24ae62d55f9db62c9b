KVM: Mapping IOMMU pages after updating memslot

In kvm_iommu_map_pages(), we need to know the page size via call
kvm_host_page_size(). And it will check whether the target slot
is valid before return the right page size.
Currently, we will map the iommu pages when creating a new slot.
But we call kvm_iommu_map_pages() during preparing the new slot.
At that time, the new slot is not visible by domain(still in preparing).
So we cannot get the right page size from kvm_host_page_size() and
this will break the IOMMU super page logic.
The solution is to map the iommu pages after we insert the new slot
into domain.
