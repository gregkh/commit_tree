sched: Initialize power_orig for overlapping groups

Yinghai reported that he saw a /0 in sg_capacity on his EX parts.
Make sure to always initialize power_orig now that we actually use it.

Ideally build_sched_domains() -> init_sched_groups_power() would also
initialize this; but for some yet unexplained reason some setups seem
to miss updates there.
