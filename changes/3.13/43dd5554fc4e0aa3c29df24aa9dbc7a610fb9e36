gpu: host1x: Silence a few warnings with LPAE=y

When building with LPAE=y (64-bit dma_addr_t), the following warnings are seen:

drivers/gpu/host1x/hw/cdma_hw.c:57:3: warning: format '%x' expects
  argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 5 has type 'dma_addr_t'

drivers/gpu/host1x/hw/debug_hw.c:167:10: warning: format '%x' expects
  argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 3 has type 'dma_addr_t'

The agreed-to solution for this is upcast to u64 and using %llx.
