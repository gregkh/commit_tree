audit: audit feature to only allow unsetting the loginuid

This is a new audit feature which only grants processes with
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL the ability to unset their loginuid.  They cannot
directly set it from a valid uid to another valid uid.  The ability to
unset the loginuid is nice because a priviledged task, like that of
container creation, can unset the loginuid and then priv is not needed
inside the container when a login daemon needs to set the loginuid.
