usb: gadget: mass_storage: convert to new interface of f_mass_storage

Convert old mass_storage gadget to use the new interface of f_mass_storage
so that later the compatibility layer in f_mass_storage can be removed.

struct fsg_common is not known to mass_storage.c, so a setter method
is added to f_mass_storage.
