KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Fix compilation without CONFIG_ALTIVEC

Commit 9d1ffdd8f3 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Don't corrupt guest state
when kernel uses VMX") added a call to kvmppc_load_up_altivec() that
isn't guarded by CONFIG_ALTIVEC, causing a link failure when building
a kernel without CONFIG_ALTIVEC set.  This adds an #ifdef to fix this.
