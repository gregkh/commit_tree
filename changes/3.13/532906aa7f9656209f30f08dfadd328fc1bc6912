dm cache: add remove_cblock method to policy interface

Implement policy_remove_cblock() and add remove_cblock method to the mq
policy.  These methods will be used by the following cache block
invalidation patch which adds the 'invalidate_cblocks' message to the
cache core.

Also, update some comments in dm-cache-policy.h
