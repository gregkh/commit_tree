KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save/restore SIAR and SDAR along with other PMU registers

Currently we are not saving and restoring the SIAR and SDAR registers in
the PMU (performance monitor unit) on guest entry and exit.  The result
is that performance monitoring tools in the guest could get false
information about where a program was executing and what data it was
accessing at the time of a performance monitor interrupt.  This fixes
it by saving and restoring these registers along with the other PMU
registers on guest entry/exit.

This also provides a way for userspace to access these values for a
vcpu via the one_reg interface.
