cpufreq: arm_big_little: reconfigure switcher behavior at run time

The b.L switcher can be turned on/off at run time.  It is therefore
necessary to change the cpufreq driver behavior accordingly.

The driver must be unregistered/registered with the cpufreq core
to reconfigure freq tables for the virtual or actual CPUs. This is
accomplished via the b.L switcher notifier callback.
