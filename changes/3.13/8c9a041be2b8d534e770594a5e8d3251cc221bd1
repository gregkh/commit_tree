LT_ADDR has not been reserved, the Unknown Connection Identifier (0x02)

Due to Limited Resources (0x0D) error code shall be returned.

The LPO_Allowed parameter informs the BR/EDR Controller whether it is
allowed to sleep.

The Packet_Type parameter specifies which packet types are allowed. The
Host shall either enable BR packet types only, or shall enable EDR and DM1
packet types only.

The Interval_Min and Interval_Max parameters specify the range from which
the BR/EDR Controller must select the Connectionless Slave Broadcast
Interval. The selected Interval is returned."
