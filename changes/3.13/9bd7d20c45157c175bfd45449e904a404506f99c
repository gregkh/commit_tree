sctp: loading sctp when load sctp_probe

when I modprobe sctp_probe, it failed with "FATAL: ". I found that
sctp should load before sctp_probe register jprobe. So I add a
sctp_setup_jprobe for loading 'sctp' when first failed to register
jprobe, just do this similar to dccp_probe.

v2: add MODULE_SOFTDEP and check of request_module, as suggested by Neil
