ixgbe: fix build err, num_rx_queues is only available with CONFIG_RPS

In the recent support for layer 2 hardware acceleration, I added a
few references to real_num_rx_queues and num_rx_queues which are
only available with CONFIG_RPS.

The fix is first to remove unnecessary references to num_rx_queues.
Because the hardware offload case is limited to cases where RX queues
and TX queues are equal we only need a single check. Then wrap the
single case in an ifdef.

The patch that introduce this is here,
