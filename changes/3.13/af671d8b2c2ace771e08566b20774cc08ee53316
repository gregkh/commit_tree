cpufreq: pmac64: provide cpufreq transition latency for older G5 models

Currently cpufreq ondemand governor cannot used on older G5 models,
because the transition latency is set to CPUFREQ_ETERNAL. Provide a
value based on a measurement on Xserve G5, which happens to be also the
highest allowed latency.
