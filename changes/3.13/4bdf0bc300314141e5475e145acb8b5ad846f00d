KEYS: Introduce a search context structure

Search functions pass around a bunch of arguments, each of which gets copied
with each call.  Introduce a search context structure to hold these.

Whilst we're at it, create a search flag that indicates whether the search
should be directly to the description or whether it should iterate through all
keys looking for a non-description match.

This will be useful when keyrings use a generic data struct with generic
routines to manage their content as the search terms can just be passed
through to the iterator callback function.

Also, for future use, the data to be supplied to the match function is
separated from the description pointer in the search context.  This makes it
clear which is being supplied.
