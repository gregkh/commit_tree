random: optimize spinlock use in add_device_randomness()

The add_device_randomness() function calls mix_pool_bytes() twice for
the input pool and the non-blocking pool, for a total of four times.
By using _mix_pool_byte() and taking the spinlock in
add_device_randomness(), we can halve the number of times we need
take each pool's spinlock.
