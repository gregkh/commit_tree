gpiolib: add missing declarations

Add declaration of 'struct of_phandle_args' to avoid the following
warning:

  In file included from arch/arm/mach-tegra/board-paz00.c:21:0:
  include/linux/gpio/driver.h:102:17: warning: 'struct of_phandle_args' declared inside parameter list
  include/linux/gpio/driver.h:102:17: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want

Also proactively add other definitions/includes that could be missing
in other contexts.
