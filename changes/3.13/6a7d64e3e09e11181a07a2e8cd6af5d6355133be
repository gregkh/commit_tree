e1000: prevent oops when adapter is being closed and reset simultaneously

This change is based on a similar change made to e1000e support in
commit bb9e44d0d0f4 ("e1000e: prevent oops when adapter is being closed
and reset simultaneously").  The same issue has also been observed
on the older e1000 cards.

Here, we have increased the RESET_COUNT value to 50 because there are too
many accesses to e1000 nic on stress tests to e1000 nic, it is not enough
to set RESET_COUT 25. Experimentation has shown that it is enough to set
RESET_COUNT 50.
