timer stats: Add a 'Collection: active/inactive' line to timer usage statistics

We can enable/disable timer statistics collection via:

  echo [1|0] > /proc/timers_stats

and it would be nice if apps had the ability to check
what the current collection status is.

This patch adds a 'Collection: active/inactive' line to display the
current timer collection status.

Also bump up the timer stats version to v0.3.
