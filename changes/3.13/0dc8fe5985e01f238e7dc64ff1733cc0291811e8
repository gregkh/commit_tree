drm: introduce drm_dev_free() to fix error paths

The error paths in DRM bus drivers currently leak memory as they don't
correctly revert drm_dev_alloc(). Introduce drm_dev_free() to free DRM
devices which haven't been registered, yet.

We must be careful not to introduce any side-effects with cleanups done in
drm_dev_free(). drm_ht_remove(), drm_ctxbitmap_cleanup() and
drm_gem_destroy() are all fine in that regard.
