IPv6: Fixed support for blackhole and prohibit routes

The behaviour of blackhole and prohibit routes has been corrected by setting
the input and output pointers of the dst variable appropriately. For
blackhole routes, they are set to dst_discard and to ip6_pkt_discard and
ip6_pkt_discard_out respectively for prohibit routes.

ipv6: ip6_pkt_prohibit(_out) should not depend on
CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES

We need ip6_pkt_prohibit(_out) available without
CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES
