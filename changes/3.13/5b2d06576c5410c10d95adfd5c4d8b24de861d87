dm table: fail dm_table_create on dm_round_up overflow

The dm_round_up function may overflow to zero.  In this case,
dm_table_create() must fail rather than go on to allocate an empty array
with alloc_targets().

This fixes a possible memory corruption that could be caused by passing
too large a number in "param->target_count".
