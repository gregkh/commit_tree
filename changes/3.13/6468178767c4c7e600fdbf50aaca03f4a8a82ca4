arm64: let the core code deal with preempt_count

Commit f27dde8deef3 (sched: Add NEED_RESCHED to the preempt_count)
introduced the use of bit 31 in preempt_count for obscure scheduling
purposes.

This causes interrupts taken from EL0 to hit the (open coded) BUG when
this flag is flipped while handling the interrupt (we compare the
values before and after, and kill the kernel if they are different).

The fix is to stop messing with the preempt count entirely, as this
is already being dealt with in the generic code (irq_enter/irq_exit).

Tested on a dual A53 FPGA running cyclictest.
