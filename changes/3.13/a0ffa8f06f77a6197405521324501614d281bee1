Revert "parisc: implement full version of access_ok()"

This reverts commit 63379c135331c724d40a87b98eb62d2122981341.

It broke userspace and adding more checking is not needed.
Even checking if a syscall would access memory in page zero doesn't
makes sense since it may lead to some syscalls returning -EFAULT
where we would return other error codes on other platforms.
In summary, just drop this change and return to always return 1.
