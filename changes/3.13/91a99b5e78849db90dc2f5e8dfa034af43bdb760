USB: EHCI: use consistent NO_FRAME value

ehci-hcd is inconsistent in the sentinel values it uses to indicate
that no frame number has been assigned for a periodic transfer.  Some
places it uses NO_FRAME (defined as 65535), other places it uses -1,
and elsewhere it uses 9999.

This patch defines a value for NO_FRAME which can fit in a 16-bit
signed integer, and changes the code to use it everywhere.
