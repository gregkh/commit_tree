sit: link local routes are missing

When a link local address was added to a sit interface, the corresponding route
was not configured. This breaks routing protocols that use the link local
address, like OSPFv3.

To ease the code reading, I remove sit_route_add(), which only adds v4 mapped
routes, and add this kind of route directly in sit_add_v4_addrs(). Thus link
local and v4 mapped routes are configured in the same place.
