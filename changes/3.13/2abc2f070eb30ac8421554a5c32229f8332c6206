pkt_sched: fq: change classification of control packets

Initial sch_fq implementation copied code from pfifo_fast to classify
a packet as a high prio packet.

This clashes with setups using PRIO with say 7 bands, as one of the
band could be incorrectly (mis)classified by FQ.

Packets would be queued in the 'internal' queue, and no pacing ever
happen for this special queue.
