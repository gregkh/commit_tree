[SCSI] scsi_debug: avoid partial copying PI from prot_sglist to dif_storep

If data integrity support is enabled, prot_verify_write() is called in
response to WRITE commands and it verifies protection info from
prot_sglist by comparing against data sglist, and copies protection info
to dif_storep.

When multiple blocks are transfered by a WRITE command, it verifies and
copies these blocks one by one.  So if it fails to verify protection
info in the middle of blocks, the actual data transfer to fake_storep
isn't proceeded at all although protection info for some blocks are
already copied to dif_storep.  Therefore, it breaks the data integrity
between fake_storep and dif_storep.

This fixes it by ensuring that copying protection info to dif_storep is
done after all blocks are successfully verified.  Reusing dif_copy_prot()
with supporting the opposite direction simplifies this fix.
