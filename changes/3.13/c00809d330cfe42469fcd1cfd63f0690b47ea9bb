USB: ohci-exynos: Remove non-DT support

The non-DT for EXYNOS SoCs is not supported from v3.11.
Thus, there is no need to support non-DT for Exynos OHCI driver.

The 'include/linux/platform_data/usb-ohci-exynos.h' file has been
used for non-DT support. Thus, the 'usb-ohci-exynos.h' file can
be removed.
