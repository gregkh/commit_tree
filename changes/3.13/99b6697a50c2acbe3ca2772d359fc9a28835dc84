IB/srp: Avoid offlining operational SCSI devices

If SCSI commands are submitted with a SCSI request timeout that is
lower than the the IB RC timeout, it can happen that the SCSI error
handler has already started device recovery before transport layer
error handling starts.  So it can happen that the SCSI error handler
tries to abort a SCSI command after it has been reset by
srp_rport_reconnect().

Tell the SCSI error handler that such commands have finished and that
it is not necessary to continue its recovery strategy for commands
that have been reset by srp_rport_reconnect().
