cpufreq: create per policy rwsem instead of per CPU cpu_policy_rwsem

We have per-CPU cpu_policy_rwsem for cpufreq core, but we never use
all of them. We always use rwsem of policy->cpu and so we can
actually make this rwsem per policy instead.

This patch does this change. With this change other tricky situations
are also avoided now, like which lock to take while we are changing
policy->cpu, etc.
