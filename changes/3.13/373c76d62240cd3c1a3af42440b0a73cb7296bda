powerpc: Add TIF_ELF2ABI flag.

Little endian ppc64 is getting an exciting new ABI.  This is reflected
by the bottom two bits of e_flags in the ELF header:

	0 == legacy binaries (v1 ABI)
	1 == binaries using the old ABI (compiled with a new toolchain)
	2 == binaries using the new ABI.

We store this in a thread flag, because we need to set it in core
dumps and for signal delivery.  Our chief concern is that it doesn't
use function descriptors.
