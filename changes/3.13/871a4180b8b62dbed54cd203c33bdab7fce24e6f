mac80211: split off ibss disconnect

IBSS CSA will require to disconnect if a channel switch fails, but
mac80211 should search and re-connect after this disconnect. To allow
such usage, split off the ibss disconnect process in a separate function
which only performs the disconnect without overwriting nl80211-supplied
parameters.
