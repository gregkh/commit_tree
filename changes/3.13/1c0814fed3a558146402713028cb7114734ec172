drm: Add a SET_CLIENT_CAP ioctl

This ioctl can be used to turn some knobs in a DRM driver. The client
can ask the DRM core for an alternate view of the reality: it can be
useful to be able to instruct the core that the DRM client can handle
new functionnality that would otherwise break current ABI.

v2: Rename to ioctl from SET_CAP to SET_CLIENT_CAP (Chris Wilson)
