KEYS: Consolidate the concept of an 'index key' for key access

Consolidate the concept of an 'index key' for accessing keys.  The index key
is the search term needed to find a key directly - basically the key type and
the key description.  We can add to that the description length.

This will be useful when turning a keyring into an associative array rather
than just a pointer block.
