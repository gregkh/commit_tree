staging/android: Persistent formatting of help Kconfig entries

Three entries were recently added with help listed as "help", while
all previous entries were listed as "---help---" to make it more
noticeable.

This commit fixes that. Sorry that it is so trivial, but it's
been bugging me for a while.
