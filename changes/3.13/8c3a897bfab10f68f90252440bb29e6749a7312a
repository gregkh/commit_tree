inet: restore gso for vxlan

Alexei reported a performance regression on vxlan, caused
by commit 3347c9602955 "ipv4: gso: make inet_gso_segment() stackable"

GSO vxlan packets were not properly segmented, adding IP fragments
while they were not expected.

Rename 'bool tunnel' to 'bool encap', and add a new boolean
to express the fact that UDP should be fragmented.
This fragmentation is triggered by skb->encapsulation being set.

Remove a "skb->encapsulation = 1" added in above commit,
as its not needed, as frags inherit skb->frag from original
GSO skb.
