bcache: New writeback PD controller

The old writeback PD controller could get into states where it had throttled all
the way down and take way too long to recover - it was too complicated to really
understand what it was doing.

This rewrites a good chunk of it to hopefully be simpler and make more sense,
and it also pays more attention to units which should make the behaviour a bit
easier to understand.
