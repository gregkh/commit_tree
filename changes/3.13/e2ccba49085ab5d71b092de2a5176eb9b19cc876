ARM: 7897/1: kexec: Use the right ISA for relocate_new_kernel

Copying a function with memcpy() and then trying to execute the
result isn't trivially portable to Thumb.

This patch modifies the kexec soft restart code to copy its
assembler trampoline relocate_new_kernel() using fncpy() instead,
so that relocate_new_kernel can be in the same ISA as the rest of
the kernel without problems.
