Btrfs: eliminate the exceptional root_tree refs=0

The fact that btrfs_root_refs() returned 0 for the tree_root caused
bugs in the past, therefore it is set to 1 with this patch and
(hopefully) all affected code is adapted to this change.

I verified this change by temporarily adding WARN_ON() checks
everywhere where btrfs_root_refs() is used, checking whether the
logic of the code is changed by btrfs_root_refs() returning 1
instead of 0 for root->root_key.objectid == BTRFS_ROOT_TREE_OBJECTID.
With these added checks, I ran the xfstests './check -g auto'.

The two roots chunk_root and log_root_tree that are only referenced
by the superblock and the log_roots below the log_root_tree still
have btrfs_root_refs() == 0, only the tree_root is changed.
