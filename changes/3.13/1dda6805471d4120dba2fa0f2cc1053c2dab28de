drm: delete unconsumed pending event list in drm_events_release

When there are unconsumed pending events, the events are
destroyed by calling destroy callback, but the events list
are remained, because there is no list_del().

It is possible that the page flip request is handled after
drm_events_release() is called and before drm_fb_release().
In this case a drm_pending_event is remained not freed.
So exynos driver checks again to remove it in its post
close routine. But the file_priv->event_list contains
undeleted ones, this can make oops for accessing invalid
memory.
