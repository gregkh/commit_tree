dm table: print error on preresume failure

If preresume fails it is worth logging an error given that a device is
left suspended due to the failure.

This change was motivated by local preresume error logging that was
added to the cache target ("preresume failed").  Elevating this
target-agnostic context for the where the target-specific error occurred
relative to the DM core's callouts makes sense.
