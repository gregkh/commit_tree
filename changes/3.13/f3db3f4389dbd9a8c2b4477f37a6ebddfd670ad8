ARM: 7885/1: Save/Restore 64-bit TTBR registers on LPAE suspend/resume

LPAE enabled kernels use the 64-bit version of TTBR0 and TTBR1
registers. If we're running an LPAE kernel, fill the upper half
of TTBR0 with 0 because we're setting it to the idmap here (the
idmap is guaranteed to be < 4Gb) and fully restore TTBR1 instead
of just restoring the lower 32 bits. Failure to do so can cause
failures on resume from suspend when these registers are only
half restored.
