cpufreq: arm_big_little: add vexpress SPC interface driver

The TC2(i.e. CA15_A7) Versatile Express has external Cortex M3 based
power controller which is responsible for CPU DVFS and SPC provides
the interface for the same.

This patch adds a tiny interface driver to check if OPPs are
initialised by SPC platform code and register the arm_big_little
cpufreq driver.
