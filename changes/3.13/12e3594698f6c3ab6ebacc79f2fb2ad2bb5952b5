xfrm: prevent ipcomp scratch buffer race condition

In ipcomp_compress(), sortirq is enabled too early, allowing the
per-cpu scratch buffer to be rewritten by ipcomp_decompress()
(called on the same CPU in softirq context) between populating
the buffer and copying the compressed data to the skb.

v2: as pointed out by Steffen Klassert, if we also move the
local_bh_disable() before reading the per-cpu pointers, we can
get rid of get_cpu()/put_cpu().

v3: removed ipcomp_decompress part (as explained by Herbert Xu,
it cannot be called from process context), get rid of cpu
variable (thanks to Eric Dumazet)
