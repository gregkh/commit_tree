bcache: bch_(btree|extent)_ptr_invalid()

Trying to treat btree pointers and leaf node pointers the same way was a
mistake - going to start being more explicit about the type of
key/pointer we're dealing with. This is the first part of that
refactoring; this patch shouldn't change any actual behaviour.
