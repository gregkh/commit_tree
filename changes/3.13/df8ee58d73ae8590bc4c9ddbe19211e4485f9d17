ARM: shmobile: Remove non-multiplatform KZM9D reference support

Now when CCF is supported remove the legacy KZM9D reference
Kconfig bits CONFIG_MACH_KZM9D_REFERENCE for the non-multiplatform
case.

Starting from this commit KZM9D board support is always enabled
via CONFIG_MACH_KZM9D, and CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM is used
to select between board-kzm9d.c and board-kzm9d-reference.c

The file board-kzm9d-reference.c can no longer be used together
with the legacy sh-clk clock framework, instead CCF is used.
