KVM: x86: fix KVM_SET_XCRS for CPUs that do not support XSAVE

The KVM_SET_XCRS ioctl must accept anything that KVM_GET_XCRS
could return.  XCR0's bit 0 is always 1 in real processors with
XSAVE, and KVM_GET_XCRS will always leave bit 0 set even if the
emulated processor does not have XSAVE.  So, KVM_SET_XCRS must
ignore that bit when checking for attempts to enable unsupported
save states.
