xen-netback: enable IPv6 TCP GSO to the guest

This patch adds code to handle SKB_GSO_TCPV6 skbs and construct appropriate
extra or prefix segments to pass the large packet to the frontend. New
xenstore flags, feature-gso-tcpv6 and feature-gso-tcpv6-prefix, are sampled
to determine if the frontend is capable of handling such packets.
