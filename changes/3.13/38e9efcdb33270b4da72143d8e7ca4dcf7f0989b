random32: move rnd_state to linux/random.h

struct rnd_state got mistakenly pulled into uapi header. It is not
used anywhere and does also not belong there!

Commit 5960164fde ("lib/random32: export pseudo-random number
generator for modules"), the last commit on rnd_state before it
got moved to uapi, says:

  This patch moves the definition of struct rnd_state and the inline
  __seed() function to linux/random.h.  It renames the static __random32()
  function to prandom32() and exports it for use in modules.

Hence, the structure was moved from lib/random32.c to linux/random.h
so that it can be used within modules (FCoE-related code in this
case), but not from user space. However, it seems to have been
mistakenly moved to uapi header through the uapi script. Since no-one
should make use of it from the linux headers, move the structure back
to the kernel for internal use, so that it can be modified on demand.

Joint work with Hannes Frederic Sowa.
