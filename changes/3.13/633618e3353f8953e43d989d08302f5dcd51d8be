dm cache policy mq: reduce memory requirements

Rather than storing the cblock in each cache entry, we allocate all
entries in an array and infer the cblock from the entry position.

Saves 4 bytes of memory per cache block.  In addition, this gives us an
easy way of looking up cache entries by cblock.

We no longer need to keep an explicit bitset to track which cblocks
have been allocated.  And no searching is needed to find free cblocks.
