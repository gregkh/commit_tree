slub: proper kmemleak tracking if CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG disabled

Move all kmemleak calls into hook functions, and make it so
that all hooks (both inside and outside of #ifdef CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG)
call the appropriate kmemleak routines.  This allows for kmemleak
to be configured independently of slub debug features.

It also fixes a bug where kmemleak was only partially enabled in some
configurations.
