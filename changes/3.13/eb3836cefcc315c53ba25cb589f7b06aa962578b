staging: ft1000: function scram_start_dwnld extracted from scram_dnldr in ft1000_download.c

function scram_dnldr is over 500 lines long, with deep indents that
trigger checkpatch warnings for too many tabs. It mainly consists of a
switch statement with long, complicated cases. The first case has been
extracted to form the helper function scram_start_dwnld. Some style
issues in the extracted lines have been corrected as well.
