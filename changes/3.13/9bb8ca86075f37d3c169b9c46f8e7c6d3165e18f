virtio-net: switch to use XPS to choose txq

We used to use a percpu structure vq_index to record the cpu to queue
mapping, this is suboptimal since it duplicates the work of XPS and
loses all other XPS functionality such as allowing user to configure
their own transmission steering strategy.

So this patch switches to use XPS and suggest a default mapping when
the number of cpus is equal to the number of queues. With XPS support,
there's no need for keeping per-cpu vq_index and .ndo_select_queue(),
so they were removed also.
