clk: exynos: File scope reg_save array should depend on PM_SLEEP

Move reg_save[] into CONFIG_PM_SLEEP dependency block as it is used only
by suspend and resume functions.

This fixes the warning on CONFIG_PM_SLEEP=n:
drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos-audss.c:29:22: warning: ‘reg_save’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
