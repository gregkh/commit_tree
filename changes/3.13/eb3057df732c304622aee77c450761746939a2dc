kernel: add support for init_array constructors

This adds the .init_array section as yet another section with constructors. This
is needed because gcc could add __gcov_init calls to .init_array or .ctors
section, depending on gcc (and binutils) version .

v2: - reuse mod->ctors for .init_array section for modules, because gcc uses
      .ctors or .init_array, but not both at the same time
v3: - fail to load if that does happen somehow.
