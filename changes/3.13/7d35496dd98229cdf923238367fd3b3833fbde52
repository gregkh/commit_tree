ARM: 7796/1: scsi: Use dma_max_pfn(dev) helper for bounce_limit calculations

DMA bounce limit is the maximum direct DMA'able memory beyond which
bounce buffers has to be used to perform dma operations. SCSI driver
relies on dma_mask but its calculation is based on max_*pfn which
don't have uniform meaning across architectures. So make use of
dma_max_pfn() which is expected to return the DMAable maximum pfn
value across architectures.
