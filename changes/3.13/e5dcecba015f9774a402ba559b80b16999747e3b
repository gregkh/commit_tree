drop_monitor/genetlink: use proper genetlink multicast APIs

The drop monitor code is abusing the genetlink API and is
statically using the generic netlink multicast group 1, even
if that group belongs to somebody else (which it invariably
will, since it's not reserved.)

Make the drop monitor code use the proper APIs to reserve a
group ID, but also reserve the group id 1 in generic netlink
code to preserve the userspace API. Since drop monitor can
be a module, don't clear the bit for it on unregistration.
