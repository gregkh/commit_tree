backlight: lp855x_bl: support new LP8555 device

LP8555 is one of the LP855x family devices.

This device needs pre_init_device() and post_init_device() driver
structure.  It's same as LP8557, so the device configuration code is
shared with LP8557.  Backlight outputs are generated from dual DC-DC boost
converters.  It's configurable EPROM settings which are defined in the
platform data.

Driver documentation and device tree bindings are updated.
