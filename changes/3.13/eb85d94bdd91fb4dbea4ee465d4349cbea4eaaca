CIFS: Fix symbolic links usage

Now we treat any reparse point as a symbolic link and map it to a Unix
one that is not true in a common case due to many reparse point types
supported by SMB servers.

Distinguish reparse point types into two groups:
1) that can be accessed directly through a reparse point
(junctions, deduplicated files, NFS symlinks);
2) that need to be processed manually (Windows symbolic links, DFS);

and map only Windows symbolic links to Unix ones.
