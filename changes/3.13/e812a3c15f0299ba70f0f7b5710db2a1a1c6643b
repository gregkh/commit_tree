ARM: 7849/2: h3600: update defconfig

This updates the h3600 defconfig against the latest kernel with
some small options coming and going due to Kconfig structure,
then modernize it to:

- Configure for low latency preemptive kernel
- Configure for tickless idle
- Enable HRtimers

Tested on the iPAQ h3630.
