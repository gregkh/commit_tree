slab: use struct page for slab management

Now, there are a few field in struct slab, so we can overload these
over struct page. This will save some memory and reduce cache footprint.

After this change, slabp_cache and slab_size no longer related to
a struct slab, so rename them as freelist_cache and freelist_size.

These changes are just mechanical ones and there is no functional change.
