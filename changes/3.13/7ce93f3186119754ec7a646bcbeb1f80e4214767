ARM: OMAP2+: Fix more missing data for omap3.dtsi file

After dropping the duplicate data in hwmod that now should come from
the .dts files, I noticed few more entries missing. Let's add these
as otherwise devices relying on these won't work.

Looks like the side tone entries are bundled into the mcbsp1 to 3,
so that may needs some special handling in the hwmod code as it's
currently trying to look up mcbsp2_sidetone and mcbsp3_sidetone
entries.
