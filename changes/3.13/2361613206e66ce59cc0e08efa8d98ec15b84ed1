of/irq: Refactor interrupt-map parsing

All the users of of_irq_parse_raw pass in a raw interrupt specifier from
the device tree and expect it to be returned (possibly modified) in an
of_phandle_args structure. However, the primary function of
of_irq_parse_raw() is to check for translations due to the presence of
one or more interrupt-map properties. The actual placing of the data
into an of_phandle_args structure is trivial. If it is refactored to
accept an of_phandle_args structure directly, then it becomes possible
to consume of_phandle_args from other sources. This is important for an
upcoming patch that allows a device to be connected to more than one
interrupt parent. It also simplifies the code a bit.

The biggest complication with this patch is that the old version works
on the interrupt specifiers in __be32 form, but the of_phandle_args
structure is intended to carry it in the cpu-native version. A bit of
churn was required to make this work. In the end it results in tighter
code, so the churn is worth it.
