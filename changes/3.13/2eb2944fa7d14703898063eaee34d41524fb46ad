mmc: dw_mmc: Set timeout to max upon resume

The TMOUT register is set to 0xffffffff at probe time but isn't
set after suspend/resume.  Add an init of this value.

No problems were observed without this (it will also be set in
__dw_mci_start_request if there is data to send), but it makes the
register dump before and after suspend cleaner.
