Btrfs: do not release metadata for space cache inodes

I've been testing our error paths and I was tripping the BUG_ON() in
drop_outstanding_extent because our outstanding_extents is 0 for space cache
inodes.  This is because we don't reserve metadata space for these inodes since
we depend on the global block reserve for our space.  To fix this we need to
make sure the DO_ACCOUNTING stuff doesn't actually call release_metadata for
space cache inodes.  With this patch I'm no longer panicing.  Thanks,
