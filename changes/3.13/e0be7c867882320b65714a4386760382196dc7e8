iommu: Change iommu driver to call map trace event

Change iommu driver to call map trace event. This iommu_map_unmap class event
can be enabled to trigger when iommu map iommu ops is called. Trace information
includes iova, physical address (map event only), and size.

Testing:
Added trace calls to iommu_prepare_identity_map() for testing some of the
conditions that are hard to trigger. Here is the trace from the testing:

       swapper/0-1     [003] ....     1.854102: map: IOMMU: iova=0x00000000cb800000 paddr=0x00000000cf9fffff size=0x400
