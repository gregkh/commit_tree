ALSA: hda - Fix complete_all() timing in deferred probes

When the probe of snd-hda-intel driver is deferred due to f/w loading
or the nested module loading, complete_all() should be also delayed
until the initialization really finished.  Otherwise, vga-switcheroo
client would start switching before the actual init is done.
