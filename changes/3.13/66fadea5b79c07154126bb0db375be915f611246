usb: musb: only cancel work if it is initialized

Since commit c5340bd14 ("usb: musb: cancel work on removal") the workqueue
is cancelled but then if we bail out before the workqueue is setup we
get this:

|platform musb-hdrc.1.auto: Driver musb-hdrc requests probe deferral

This patch moves the init part to earlier part so it can be cleaned as
part of the fail3 label because now it is surrounded by the fail4 label.
Step two is to remove it from musb_free() and add it to the two cleanup
paths (error path and device removal) separately.
