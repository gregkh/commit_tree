drm/i915: add some assertions about VBT DDI port types

Our code makes a lot of assumptions regarding what each DDI port
actually supports, and the VBT should tell us what is really happening
in the hardware. So parse the information provided by the VBT and
check if any of our assumptions is wrong.

Our driver also has a history of not really trusting the VBT, so a
WARN here could mean that:
 a) our coding assumptions are wrong
 b) the VBT is wrong
 c) we're incorrectly parsing the VBT
 d) the checks are wrong

But I really hope we won't ever trigger any of those WARNs.

v2: Don't check the redundant "Capabilities" field from byte 24 since
    it doesn't seem to be used.
v3: Rebase
v4: Replace WARN with DRM_DEBUG_KMS
