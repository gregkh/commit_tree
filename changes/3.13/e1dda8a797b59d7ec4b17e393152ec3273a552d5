sched/numa: Fix placement of workloads spread across multiple nodes

The load balancer will spread workloads across multiple NUMA nodes,
in order to balance the load on the system. This means that sometimes
a task's preferred node has available capacity, but moving the task
there will not succeed, because that would create too large an imbalance.

In that case, other NUMA nodes need to be considered.
