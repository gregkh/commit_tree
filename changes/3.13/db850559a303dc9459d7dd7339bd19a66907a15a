drivers: net : cpsw: pass proper device name while requesting irq

During checking the interrupts with "cat /proc/interrupts", it is showing
device name as (null), this change was done with commit id aa1a15e2d where
request_irq is changed to devm_request_irq also changing the irq name from
platform device name to net device name, but the net device is not
registered at this point with the network frame work, so devm_request_irq
is called with device name as NULL, by which it is showed as "(null)" in
"cat /proc/interrupts". So this patch changes back irq name to platform
device name itself in devm_request_irq so that the device name shows as
below.
