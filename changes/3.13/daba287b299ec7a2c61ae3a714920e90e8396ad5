ipv4: fix DO and PROBE pmtu mode regarding local fragmentation with UFO/CORK

UFO as well as UDP_CORK do not respect IP_PMTUDISC_DO and
IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE well enough.

UFO enabled packet delivery just appends all frags to the cork and hands
it over to the network card. So we just deliver non-DF udp fragments
(DF-flag may get overwritten by hardware or virtual UFO enabled
interface).

UDP_CORK does enqueue the data until the cork is disengaged. At this
point it sets the correct IP_DF and local_df flags and hands it over to
ip_fragment which in this case will generate an icmp error which gets
appended to the error socket queue. This is not reflected in the syscall
error (of course, if UFO is enabled this also won't happen).

Improve this by checking the pmtudisc flags before appending data to the
socket and if we still can fit all data in one packet when IP_PMTUDISC_DO
or IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE is set, only then proceed.

We use (mtu-fragheaderlen) to check for the maximum length because we
ensure not to generate a fragment and non-fragmented data does not need
to have its length aligned on 64 bit boundaries. Also the passed in
ip_options are already aligned correctly.

Maybe, we can relax some other checks around ip_fragment. This needs
more research.
