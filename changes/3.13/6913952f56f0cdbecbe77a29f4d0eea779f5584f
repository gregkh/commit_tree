ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: AM43x support

Add hwmod support for IP's that are present in AM43x, but not in AM335x.
AM43x additional ones added here are,
1. synctimer
2. timer8-11
3. ehrpwm3-5
4. spi2-4
5. gpio4-5

AM43x pruss interconnect which is different as compared to AM335x, has
been taken care.

And register offsets for same hwmod's shared with AM335x is different,
AM43x register offsets are updated appropriately.

ocp clock of those in l4_wkup is fed from "sys_clkin_ck" instead of
"dpll_core_m4_div2_ck", so "ocpif" for those in AM43x l4_wkup has been
added seperately.

hwmod's has been added for those that have main clock (wkup_m3, control,
gpio0) and clock domain (l4_hs) different from AM335x. debugss and
adc_tsc that have different clocks and clockdomains repectively has not
been added due to the reasons mentioned below.

AM43x also has IP's like qspi, hdq1w, vpfe, des, rng, usb, dss, debugss,
adc_tsc. These are not handled here due to both/either of following
reasons,
1. To avoid churn; most of them don't have DT bindings, which would
   necessitate adding address space in hwmod, which any way would have
   to be removed once DT bindings happen with driver support.
2. patches would come in from sources other than the author
