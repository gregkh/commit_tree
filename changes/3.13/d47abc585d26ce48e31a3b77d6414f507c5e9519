drm/radeon: Push get_scanout_position() timestamping into kms driver.

Move the ktime_get() clock readouts and potential preempt_disable()
calls from drm core into kms driver to make it compatible with the
api changes in the drm core.

This should not introduce any change in functionality or behaviour
in radeon-kms, just a reshuffling of code.
