GFS2: new function gfs2_rbm_incr

Since the previous patch eliminated bi in favor of bii, this follow-on
patch needed to be adjusted accordingly. Here is the revised version.

This patch adds a new function, gfs2_rbm_incr, which increments
an rbm structure. This is more efficient than calling gfs2_rbm_to_block,
incrementing, then calling gfs2_rbm_from_block.
