aio: fix kioctx leak introduced by "aio: Fix a trinity splat"

e34ecee2ae791df674dfb466ce40692ca6218e43 reworked the percpu reference
counting to correct a bug trinity found.  Unfortunately, the change lead
to kioctxes being leaked because there was no final reference count to
put.  Add that reference count back in to fix things.
