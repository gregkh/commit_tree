ARM: kirkwood: Remove kirkwood_setup_wins and rely on the DT binding

kirkwood_setup_wins is the last manual caller of mbus in kirkwood, don't
call it for DT boards and rely on the DT having a mbus node with
a proper ranges property to setup these windows.

Move all the mbus ranges properties for all boards into kirkwood.dtsi,
since they are currently all the same.

This makes the DT self consistent, since the physical address of the
NAND and CRYPTO are both referenced internally. The arbitary Linux
constants KIRKWOOD_NAND_MEM_PHYS_BASE and KIRKWOOD_SRAM_PHYS_BASE
no longer have to match the DT values.
