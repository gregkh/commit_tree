perf/x86/intel: Add Ivy Bridge-EP uncore IRP box support

Unlike other uncore boxes, IRP boxes live in PCI buses with no UBOX
device. For PCI bus without UBOX device, we find the next bus that
has UBOX device and use its 'bus to socket' mapping.

Besides the counter/control registers in IRP boxes are not properly
aligned.
