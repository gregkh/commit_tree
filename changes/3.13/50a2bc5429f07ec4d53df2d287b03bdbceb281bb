ACPI / AC: change notification handler type to ACPI_ALL_NOTIFY

With kernel 3.13rc5 there are no AC adapter notifications on my laptop.

Commit cc8ef5270734 "ACPI / AC: convert ACPI ac driver to platform bus"
changed the driver to listen to device notifications only. However, AML
code on my laptop notifies the driver with zero event.

This patch changes the driver to listen to all events again.
