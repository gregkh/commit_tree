ARM: 7894/1: kconfig: select GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS if HAVE_ARM_ARCH_TIMER

The ARM architected timer driver doesn't compile without
GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS selected, so ensure that we select it when building
for a platform that has the timer.

Without this patch, mach-virt fails to build without something like
mach-vexpress also selected.
