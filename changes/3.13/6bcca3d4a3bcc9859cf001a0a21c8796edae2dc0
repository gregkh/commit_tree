IB/uverbs: Check input length in flow steering uverbs

Since ib_copy_from_udata() doesn't check yet the available input data
length before accessing userspace memory, an explicit check of this
length is required to prevent:

- reading past the user provided buffer,
- underflow when subtracting the expected command size from the input
  length.

This will ensure the newly added flow steering uverbs don't try to
process truncated commands.
