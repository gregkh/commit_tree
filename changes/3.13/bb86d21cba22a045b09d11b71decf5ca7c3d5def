xfs: fix the extent count when allocating an new indirection array entry

At xfs_iext_add(), if extent(s) are being appended to the last page in
the indirection array and the new extent(s) don't fit in the page, the
number of extents(erp->er_extcount) in a new allocated entry should be
the minimum value between count and XFS_LINEAR_EXTS, instead of count.

For now, there is no existing test case can demonstrates a problem with
the er_extcount being set incorrectly here, but it obviously like a bug.
