sched/numa: Introduce migrate_swap()

Use the new stop_two_cpus() to implement migrate_swap(), a function that
flips two tasks between their respective cpus.

I'm fairly sure there's a less crude way than employing the stop_two_cpus()
method, but everything I tried either got horribly fragile and/or complex. So
keep it simple for now.

The notable detail is how we 'migrate' tasks that aren't runnable
anymore. We'll make it appear like we migrated them before they went to
sleep. The sole difference is the previous cpu in the wakeup path, so we
override this.
