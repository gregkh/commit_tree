net: Separate the close_list and the unreg_list v2

Separate the unreg_list and the close_list in dev_close_many preventing
dev_close_many from permuting the unreg_list.  The permutations of the
unreg_list have resulted in cases where the loopback device is accessed
it has been freed in code such as dst_ifdown.  Resulting in subtle memory
corruption.

This is the second bug from sharing the storage between the close_list
and the unreg_list.  The issues that crop up with sharing are
apparently too subtle to show up in normal testing or usage, so let's
forget about being clever and use two separate lists.

v2: Make all callers pass in a close_list to dev_close_many
