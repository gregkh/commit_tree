sched/numa: Slow scan rate if no NUMA hinting faults are being recorded

NUMA PTE scanning slows if a NUMA hinting fault was trapped and no page
was migrated. For long-lived but idle processes there may be no faults
but the scan rate will be high and just waste CPU. This patch will slow
the scan rate for processes that are not trapping faults.
