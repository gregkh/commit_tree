smp: don't warn about csd->flags having CSD_FLAG_LOCK cleared for !wait

blk-mq reuses the request potentially immediately, since the most
cache hot is always given out first. This means that rq->csd could
be reused between csd->func() being called and csd_unlock() being
called. This isn't a problem, since we never use wait == 1 for
the smp call function. Add CSD_FLAG_WAIT to be able to tell the
difference, retaining the warning for other cases.
