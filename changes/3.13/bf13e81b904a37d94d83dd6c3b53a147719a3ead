drm/i915: add support for per-pipe power sequencing on vlv

VLV has per-pipe PP registers. Set up power sequencing on mode set. The
connector init time setup is problematic, since we don't have a pipe at
that time. Cook up something.

v2:
 - use vlv_power_sequencer_pipe() also in _pp_{ctrl,stat}_reg()
 - use PANEL_PORT_SELECT_DPC_VLV (Ville)
