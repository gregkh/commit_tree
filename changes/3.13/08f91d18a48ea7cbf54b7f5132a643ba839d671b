staging: comedi: pcl726: tidy up the comedi_lrange code

For aesthetics, declare the comedi_lrange tables with one entry per line.

Since the range data in the boardinfo is only for the analog outputs,
rename the variables to make this clearer.

Use ARRAY_SIZE to initialize the 'ao_num_ranges' member instead of open
coding the value.
