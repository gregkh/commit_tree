net/mlx4_core: Fix reg/unreg vlan/mac to conform to the firmware spec

The functions mlx4_register_vlan, mlx4_unregister_vlan, mlx4_register_mac,
mlx4_unregister_mac all made illegal use of the out_param in multifunc mode
to pass the port number. The firmware spec specifies that the port number
should be passed in bits 8..15 of the input-modifier field for ALLOC_RES and
FREE_RES (sections 20.15.1 and 20.15.2).

For MAC register/unregister, this patch contains workarounds so that guests
running previous kernels continue to work on a new Hypervisor, and guests
running the new kernel will continue to work on old hypervisors.

Vlan registeration capability is still not operational in multifunction mode,
since the vlan wrapper functions are not implemented in this patch.
