PCI: mvebu: remove subsys_initcall

This removes the subsys_initcall from the driver and converts it to
a normal platform_driver. Also, drvdata is set and a remove functions
is added to disable the clock and free resources. As pci driver removal
currently is not supported, set .suppress_bind_attrs to permit unbinding.
