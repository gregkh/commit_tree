watchdog: omap_wdt: raw read and write endian fix

All OMAP IP blocks expect LE data, but CPU may operate in BE mode.
Need to use endian neutral functions to read/write h/w registers.
I.e instead of __raw_read[lw] and __raw_write[lw] functions code
need to use read[lw]_relaxed and write[lw]_relaxed functions.
If the first simply reads/writes register, the second will byteswap
it if host operates in BE mode.

Changes are trivial sed like replacement of __raw_xxx functions
with xxx_relaxed variant.
