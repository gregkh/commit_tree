cpuidle: don't call poll_idle_init() for every cpu

poll_idle_init() just initializes drv->states[0] and so that is
required to be done only once for each driver.  Currently, it is
called from cpuidle_enable_device() which is called for every CPU
that the driver supports.  That is not required, so move it to a
better place and call it from __cpuidle_register_driver() so that
the initialization is carried out only once.
