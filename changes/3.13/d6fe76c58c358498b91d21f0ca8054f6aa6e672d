xen: introduce xen_alloc/free_coherent_pages

xen_swiotlb_alloc_coherent needs to allocate a coherent buffer for cpu
and devices. On native x86 is sufficient to call __get_free_pages in
order to get a coherent buffer, while on ARM (and potentially ARM64) we
need to call the native dma_ops->alloc implementation.

Introduce xen_alloc_coherent_pages to abstract the arch specific buffer
allocation.

Similarly introduce xen_free_coherent_pages to free a coherent buffer:
on x86 is simply a call to free_pages while on ARM and ARM64 is
arm_dma_ops.free.

Changes in v7:
- rename __get_dma_ops to __generic_dma_ops;
- call __generic_dma_ops(hwdev)->alloc/free on arm64 too.

Changes in v6:
- call __get_dma_ops to get the native dma_ops pointer on arm.
