ARM: 7805/1: mm: change max*pfn to include the physical offset of memory

Most of the kernel code assumes that max*pfn is maximum pfns because
the physical start of memory is expected to be PFN0. Since this
assumption is not true on ARM architectures, the meaning of max*pfn
is number of memory pages. This is done to keep drivers happy which
are making use of of these variable to calculate the dma bounce limit
using dma_mask.

Now since we have a architecture override possibility for DMAable
maximum pfns, lets make meaning of max*pfns as maximum pnfs on ARM
as well.
