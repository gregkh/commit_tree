ARM: ux500: register the tc35892 GPIO on the TVK UIB

The TVK1281618 UIB has a TC35892 GPIO expander on it, which has
in the past probably been confused with the GPIO expander on the
older HREF plus previous to v60, which is on an entirely different
part of the system with another I2C address. Register the expander
in the right place.
