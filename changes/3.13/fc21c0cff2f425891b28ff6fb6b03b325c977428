revert "softirq: Add support for triggering softirq work on softirqs"

This commit was incomplete in that code to remove items from the per-cpu
lists was missing and never acquired a user in the 5 years it has been in
the tree.  We're going to implement what it seems to try to archive in a
simpler way, and this code is in the way of doing so.
