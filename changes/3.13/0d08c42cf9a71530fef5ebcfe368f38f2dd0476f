tcp: gso: fix truesize tracking

commit 6ff50cd55545 ("tcp: gso: do not generate out of order packets")
had an heuristic that can trigger a warning in skb_try_coalesce(),
because skb->truesize of the gso segments were exactly set to mss.

This breaks the requirement that

skb->truesize >= skb->len + truesizeof(struct sk_buff);

It can trivially be reproduced by :

ifconfig lo mtu 1500
ethtool -K lo tso off
netperf

As the skbs are looped into the TCP networking stack, skb_try_coalesce()
warns us of these skb under-estimating their truesize.
