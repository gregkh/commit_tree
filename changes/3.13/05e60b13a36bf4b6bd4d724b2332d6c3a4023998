staging: comedi: drivers: introduce comedi_dio_update_state()

The (*insn_bits) functions for DIO and DO subdevices typically use
the subdevice 's->state' to hold the current state of the output
channels. The 'insn' passed to these functions, INSN_BITS, specifies
two parameters passed in the 'data'.

  data[0] = 'mask', the channels to update
  data[1] = 'bits', the new state for the channels

Introduce a helper function to handle the boilerplate used to
update the internal state.

Note that the 'mask' is filtered by the 'chanmask' of the channels
actually supported by the subdevice. This is used to protect any
non-channel related bits that are stored in the subdevice state.
