parisc: provide macro to create exception table entries

Provide a macro ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_ENTRY() to create exception table
entries and convert all open-coded places to use that macro.

This patch is a first step toward creating a exception table which only
holds 32bit pointers even on a 64bit kernel. That way in my own kernel
I was able to reduce the in-kernel exception table from 44kB to 22kB.
