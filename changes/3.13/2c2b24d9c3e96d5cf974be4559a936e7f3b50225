ARM: ux500: cpuidle: fix section mismatch

The dbx500_cpuidle_probe is tagged as an __init section but the variable
dbx500_cpuidle_plat_driver is not.

The dbx500_cpuidle_probe could not be declared as __init because of macro
module_platform_driver builds the exit function, tags as __exit and this one
refers to the dbx500_cpuidle_plat_driver which is an __initdata.

That leads to a section mismatch.

Fix it by removing the __init tag for the probe function.
