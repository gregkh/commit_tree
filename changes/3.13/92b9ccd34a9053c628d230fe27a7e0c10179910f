bgmac: pass received packet to the netif instead of copying it

Copying whole packets with skb_copy_from_linear_data_offset is a pretty
bad idea. CPU was spending time in __copy_user_common and network
performance was lower. With the new solution iperf-measured speed
increased from 116Mb/s to 134Mb/s.
