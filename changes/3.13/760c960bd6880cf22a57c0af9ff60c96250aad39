drm/sysfs: fix hotplug regression since lifetime changes

airlied:
The lifetime changes introduced in 5bdebb183c9702a8c57a01dff09337be3de337a6
tried to use device_create, however that led to the regression where dev->type
wasn't getting set correctly. First attempt at fixing it would have led to
a race, so this undoes the device_createa work and does it all manually
making sure the dev->type is setup before we register the device.
