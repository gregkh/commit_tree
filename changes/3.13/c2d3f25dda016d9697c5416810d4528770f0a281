uprobes: Remove the wrong __weak attribute

linux/uprobes.h declares arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() as a weak function.
But as there is no definition of generic version so when trying to build
uprobes for an architecture that doesn't yet have a arch_uprobe_skip_sstep()
implementation, the vmlinux will try to call arch_uprobe_skip_sstep()
somehwere in Stupidhistan leading to a system crash.  We rather want a
proper link error so remove arch_uprobe_skip_sstep().
