team: fix master carrier set when user linkup is enabled

When user linkup is enabled and user sets linkup of individual port,
we need to recompute linkup (carrier) of master interface so the change
is reflected. Fix this by calling __team_carrier_check() which does the
needed work.

Please apply to all stable kernels as well. Thanks.
