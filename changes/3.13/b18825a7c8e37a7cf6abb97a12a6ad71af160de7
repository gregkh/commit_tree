VFS: Put a small type field into struct dentry::d_flags

Put a type field into struct dentry::d_flags to indicate if the dentry is one
of the following types that relate particularly to pathwalk:

	Miss (negative dentry)
	Directory
	"Automount" directory (defective - no i_op->lookup())
	Symlink
	Other (regular, socket, fifo, device)

The type field is set to one of the first five types on a dentry by calls to
__d_instantiate() and d_obtain_alias() from information in the inode (if one is
given).

The type is cleared by dentry_unlink_inode() when it reconstitutes an existing
dentry as a negative dentry.

Accessors provided are:

	d_set_type(dentry, type)
	d_is_directory(dentry)
	d_is_autodir(dentry)
	d_is_symlink(dentry)
	d_is_file(dentry)
	d_is_negative(dentry)
	d_is_positive(dentry)

A bunch of checks in pathname resolution switched to those.
