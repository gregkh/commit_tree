GFS2: don't hold s_umount over blkdev_put

This is a GFS2 version of Tejun's patch:
4f331f01b9c43bf001d3ffee578a97a1e0633eac
vfs: don't hold s_umount over close_bdev_exclusive() call

In this case its blkdev_put itself that is the issue and this
patch uses the same solution of dropping and retaking s_umount.
