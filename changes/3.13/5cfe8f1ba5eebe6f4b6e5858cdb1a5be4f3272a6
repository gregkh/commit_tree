alpha: Prevent a NULL ptr dereference in csum_partial_copy.

Introduced by 3ddc5b46a8e90f3c92 ("kernel-wide: fix missing validations
on __get/__put/__copy_to/__copy_from_user()").

Also fix some other places which could be problematic in a similar way,
although they hadn't been proved so, as far as I can tell.
