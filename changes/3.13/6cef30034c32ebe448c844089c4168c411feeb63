s390/bpf,jit: fix prolog oddity

The prolog of functions generated by the bpf jit compiler uses an
instruction sequence with an "ahi" instruction to create stack space
instead of using an "aghi" instruction. Using the 32-bit "ahi" is not
wrong as the stack we are operating on is an order-4 allocation which
is always aligned to 16KB. But it is more consistent to use an "aghi"
as the stack pointer is a 64-bit value.
