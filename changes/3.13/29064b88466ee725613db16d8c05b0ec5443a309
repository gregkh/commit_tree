ARM: bL_switcher/trace: Add kernel trace trigger interface

This patch exports a bL_switcher_trace_trigger() function to
provide a means for drivers using the trace events to get the
current status when starting a trace session.

Calling this function is equivalent to pinging the trace_trigger
file in sysfs.
