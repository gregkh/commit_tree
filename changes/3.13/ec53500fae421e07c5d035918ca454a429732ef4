kvm: Add VFIO device

So far we've succeeded at making KVM and VFIO mostly unaware of each
other, but areas are cropping up where a connection beyond eventfds
and irqfds needs to be made.  This patch introduces a KVM-VFIO device
that is meant to be a gateway for such interaction.  The user creates
the device and can add and remove VFIO groups to it via file
descriptors.  When a group is added, KVM verifies the group is valid
and gets a reference to it via the VFIO external user interface.
