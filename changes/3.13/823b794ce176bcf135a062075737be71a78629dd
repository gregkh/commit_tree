checkpatch: add check for sscanf without return use

Naked use sscanf can be troublesome because the pointed to variables may
not have been set.

Add a warning when the sscanf return value is not used.

For now, do not add __must_check to the sscanf prototype because that will
cause a couple of hundred new warnings when compiling a kernel.
