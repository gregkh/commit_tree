ALSA: hda - Fix missing ELD info when using jackpoll_ms parameter

In the case of using jackpoll_ms instead of unsol events, the jack
was correctly detected, but ELD info was not refreshed on plug-in.

And without ELD info, no proper restriction of pcm, which can in turn
break sound output on some devices.
