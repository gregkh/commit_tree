bcache: Clean up cache_lookup_fn

There was some looping in submit_partial_cache_hit() and
submit_partial_cache_hit() that isn't needed anymore - originally, we
wouldn't necessarily process the full hit or miss all at once because
when splitting the bio, we took into account the restrictions of the
device we were sending it to.

But, device bio size restrictions are now handled elsewhere, with a
wrapper around generic_make_request() - so that looping has been
unnecessary for awhile now and we can now do quite a bit of cleanup.

And if we trim the key we're reading from to match the subset we're
actually reading, we don't have to explicitly calculate bi_sector
anymore. Neat.
