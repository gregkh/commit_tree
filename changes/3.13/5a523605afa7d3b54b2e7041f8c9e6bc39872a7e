regulator: core: provide fixed voltage in desc for single voltage rail

If given rail has the single voltage (n_voltages = 1) then provide the
rail voltage through regulator descriptor so that core can use this
value for finding voltage.

This will avoid the implementation of the callback for get_voltage() or
list_voltage() callback on regulator driver.
