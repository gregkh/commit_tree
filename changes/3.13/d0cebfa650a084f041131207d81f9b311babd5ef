powerpc: word-at-a-time optimization for 64-bit Little Endian

This is an optimization for the PowerPC in 64-bit
little-endian. Bit counting is used in find_zero(), instead
of the multiply and shift.

It is modelled after Alan Modra's PowerPC LE strlen patch
http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2013-08/msg00097.html.
