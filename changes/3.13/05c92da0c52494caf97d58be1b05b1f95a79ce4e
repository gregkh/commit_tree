usb: ohci/uhci - add soft dependencies on ehci_pci

Support for specifying soft dependencies in the modules themselves was
introduced in commit 7cb14ba.

In Arch we have always been shipping a module.d(5) fragment ordering ohci/uhci
after ehci. If this ordering is really necessary, it would be great to move it
to the kernel and getting the correct fragment generated by depmod.
