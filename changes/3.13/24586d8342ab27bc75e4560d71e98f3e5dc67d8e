video: mmp: add pitch info in mmp_win structure

Add pitch length info of graphics/video layer, pitch is used
to represent line length in byte, the usage depends on pix_fmt.
If the fmt is YUV, the pitch[0] will be Y length,pitch[1]
will be U length, pitch[2] will be V lenth.
If the fmt is RGB, the picth[0] will be line lenth, and
pitch[1]/pitch[2] will be 0 and not be used.
