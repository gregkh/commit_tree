nfs: fix inverted test for delegation in nfs4_reclaim_open_state

commit 6686390bab6a0e0 (NFS: remove incorrect "Lock reclaim failed!"
warning.) added a test for a delegation before checking to see if any
reclaimed locks failed. The test however is backward and is only doing
that check when a delegation is held instead of when one isn't.
