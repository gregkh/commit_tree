lib: crc32: reduce number of cases for crc32{, c}_combine

We can safely reduce the number of test cases by a tenth.
There is no particular need to run as many as we're running
now for crc32{,c}_combine, that gives us still ~8000 tests
we're doing if people run kernels with crc selftests enabled
which is perfectly fine.
