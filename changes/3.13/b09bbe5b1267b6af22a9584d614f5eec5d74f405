ARM: bL_switcher/trace: Add trace trigger for trace bootstrapping

When tracing switching, an external tracer needs a way to bootstrap
its knowledge of the logical<->physical CPU mapping.

This patch adds a sysfs attribute trace_trigger.  A write to this
attribute will generate a power:cpu_migrate_current event for each
online CPU, indicating the current physical CPU for each logical
CPU.

Activating or deactivating the switcher also generates these
events, so that the tracer knows about the resulting remapping of
affected CPUs.
