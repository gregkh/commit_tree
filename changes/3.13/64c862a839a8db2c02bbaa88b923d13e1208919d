devres: add kernel standard devm_k.alloc functions

Currently, devm_ managed memory only supports kzalloc.

Convert the devm_kzalloc implementation to devm_kmalloc and remove the
complete memset to 0 but still set the initial struct devres header and
whatever padding before data to 0.

Add the other normal alloc variants as static inlines with __GFP_ZERO
added to the gfp flag where appropriate:

	devm_kzalloc
	devm_kcalloc
	devm_kmalloc_array

Add gfp.h to device.h for the newly added static inlines.

akpm: the current API forces us to replace kmalloc() with kzalloc() when
performing devm_ conversions.  This adds a relatively minor overhead.
More significantly, it will defeat kmemcheck used-uninitialized checking,
and for a particular driver, losing used-uninitialised checking for their
core controlling data structures will significantly degrade kmemcheck
usefulness.
