slab: change return type of kmem_getpages() to struct page

It is more understandable that kmem_getpages() return struct page.
And, with this, we can reduce one translation from virt addr to page and
makes better code than before. Below is a change of this patch.

* Before
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  22123	  23434	      4	  45561	   b1f9	mm/slab.o

* After
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  22074	  23434	      4	  45512	   b1c8	mm/slab.o

And this help following patch to remove struct slab's colouroff.
