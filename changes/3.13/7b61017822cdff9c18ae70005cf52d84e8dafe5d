Revert "dmatest: append verify result to results"

This reverts commit d86b2f298e6de124984f5d5817ed1e6e759b3ada.

The kernel log buffer is sufficient for collecting test results.  The
current logging OOMs the machine on long running tests, and usually only
the first error is relevant.  It is better to stop on error and parse
the kernel output.  If output volume becomes an issue we can always
investigate using trace messages.
