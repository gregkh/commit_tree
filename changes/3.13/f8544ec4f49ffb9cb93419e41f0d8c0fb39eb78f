s390/compat,signal: change return values to -EFAULT

Instead of returnin the number of bytes not copied and/or -EFAULT let the
signal handler helper functions always return -EFAULT if a user space
access failed.
This doesn't fix a bug in the current code, but makes is harder to get it
wrong in the future.
Also "smatch" won't complain anymore about the fact that the number of
remaining bytes gets returned instead of -EFAULT.
