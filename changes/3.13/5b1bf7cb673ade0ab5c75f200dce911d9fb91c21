virtio_ring: let virtqueue_{kick()/notify()} return a bool

virtqueue_{kick()/notify()} should exploit the new host notification API.
If the notify call returned with a negative value the host kick failed
(e.g. a kick triggered after a device was hot-unplugged). In this case
the virtqueue is set to 'broken' and false is returned, otherwise true.
