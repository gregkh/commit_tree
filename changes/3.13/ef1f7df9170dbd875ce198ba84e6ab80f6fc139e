netfilter: nf_tables: expression ops overloading

Split the expression ops into two parts and support overloading of
the runtime expression ops based on the requested function through
a ->select_ops() callback.

This can be used to provide optimized implementations, for instance
for loading small aligned amounts of data from the packet or inlining
frequently used operations into the main evaluation loop.
