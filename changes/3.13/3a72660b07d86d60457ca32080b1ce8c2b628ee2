ipc,shm: correct error return value in shmctl (SHM_UNLOCK)

Commit 2caacaa82a51 ("ipc,shm: shorten critical region for shmctl")
restructured the ipc shm to shorten critical region, but introduced a
path where the return value could be -EPERM, even if the operation
actually was performed.

Before the commit, the err return value was reset by the return value
from security_shm_shmctl() after the if (!ns_capable(...)) statement.

Now, we still exit the if statement with err set to -EPERM, and in the
case of SHM_UNLOCK, it is not reset at all, and used as the return value
from shmctl.

To fix this, we only set err when errors occur, leaving the fallthrough
case alone.
