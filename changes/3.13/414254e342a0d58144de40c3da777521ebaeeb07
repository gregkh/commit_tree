batman-adv: tvlv - gateway download/upload bandwidth container

Prior to this patch batman-adv read the advertised uplink bandwidth
from userspace and compressed this information into a single byte
called "gateway class".
Now the download & upload bandwidth information is sent as-is. No
userspace change is necessary since the sysfs API always allowed
to specify a bandwidth.
