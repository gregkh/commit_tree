dm: allow remove to be deferred

This patch allows the removal of an open device to be deferred until
it is closed.  (Previously such a removal attempt would fail.)

The deferred remove functionality is enabled by setting the flag
DM_DEFERRED_REMOVE in the ioctl structure on DM_DEV_REMOVE or
DM_REMOVE_ALL ioctl.

On return from DM_DEV_REMOVE, the flag DM_DEFERRED_REMOVE indicates if
the device was removed immediately or flagged to be removed on close -
if the flag is clear, the device was removed.

On return from DM_DEV_STATUS and other ioctls, the flag
DM_DEFERRED_REMOVE is set if the device is scheduled to be removed on
closure.

A device that is scheduled to be deleted can be revived using the
message "@cancel_deferred_remove". This message clears the
DMF_DEFERRED_REMOVE flag so that the device won't be deleted on close.
