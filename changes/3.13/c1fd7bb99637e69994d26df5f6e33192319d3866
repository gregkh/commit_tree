checkpatch: make the memory barrier test noisier

Peter Zijlstra prefers that comments be required near uses of memory
barriers.

Change the message level for memory barrier uses from a --strict test only
to a normal WARN so it's always emitted.

This might produce false positives around insertions of memory barriers
when a comment is outside the patch context block.

And checkpatch is still stupid, it only looks for existence of any
comment, not at the comment content.
