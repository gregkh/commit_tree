usb: wusbcore: serialize access to the HWA data out endpoint

This patch serializes access to the HWA data transfer out (DTO)
endpoint.  This prevents a situation where two transfer requests being
sent concurrently to separate downstream endpoints could interleave
their transfer request and transfer data packets causing data
corruption.  The transfer processing code will now attempt to acquire
the DTO resource before sending a transfer to the HWA.  If it cannot
acquire the resource, the RPIPE that the transfer is assigned to will
be placed on a waiting list.  When the DTO resource is released, the
actor releasing the resource will serivce the RPIPEs that are waiting.
