HID: sony: Send FF commands in non-atomic context

The ff_memless has a timer running which gets run in an atomic context and
calls the play_effect callback. The callback function for sony uses the
hid_output_raw_report (overwritten by sixaxis_usb_output_raw_report) function
to handle differences in the control message format. It is not safe for an
atomic context because it may sleep later in usb_start_wait_urb.

This "scheduling while atomic" can cause the system to lock up. A workaround is
to make the force feedback state update using work_queues and use the
play_effect function only to enqueue the work item.
