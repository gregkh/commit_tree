[SCSI] scsi_dh_alua: ALUA handler attach should succeed while TPG is transitioning

During testing, it was discovered that when a device tries to attach to the
alua handler while in TPG state of transitioning, the alua_rtpg function will
wait for it to exit the state before allowing it to continue. As a result, if
the 60 second timeout expires, the alua handler will not attach to the device.

To fix this, I have introduced an input argument to alua_rtpg called
wait_for_transition.  The idea is that it will wait for the transition to
complete before an activation (because the current TPG state has some bearing
in that case), but during a discovery if it is transitioning, it will not
wait, and will store the state as standby for the time being.

I believe the precedent exists for this from commit
c0d289b3e59577532c45ee9110ef81bd7b341272 Since if the device reports a state
of transitioning, it can transition to other more valid states, and it has
been established TPGS is supported on the device, if it is attaching.
