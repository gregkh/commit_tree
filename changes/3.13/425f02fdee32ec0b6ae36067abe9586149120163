omapdss: HDMI: Use OMAP4 HDMI core functions directly and remove hdmi_ip_ops

After removing wrapper, pll and phy funcs from ti_hdmi_4xxx_ip.c, we are left
with OMAP4 HDMI core functions. Use these directly in hdmi.c rather than using
hdmi_ip_ops. Rename the core functions with a 'hdmi4' suffix.

We used to have hdmi_ip_ops so that one could support HDMI within a TI SoC which
had a non-DSS display subsytem. This however never got put into use, and hence
these ops aren't useful any more.

The DT/hwmod information for hdmi doesn't split the address space according to
the required sub blocks. Keep the address offset and size information in the
driver for now. This will be removed when the driver gets the information
correctly from DT/hwmod.
