thinkpad-acpi: Add mute and mic-mute LED functionality

The LEDs are currently not visible to userspace, for security
reasons. They are exported through thinkpad_acpi.h for use by the
snd-hda-intel driver.

Thanks to Alex Hung <alex.hung@canonical.com> and Takashi Iwai
<tiwai@suse.de> for writing parts of this patch.
