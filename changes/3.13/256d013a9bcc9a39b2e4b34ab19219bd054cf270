[media] cx231xx: fix double free and leaks on failure path in cx231xx_usb_probe()

There are numerous issues in error handling code of cx231xx initialization.
Double free (when cx231xx_init_dev() calls kfree(dev) via cx231xx_release_resources()
and then cx231xx_usb_probe() does the same) and memory leaks
(e.g. usb_get_dev() before (ifnum != 1) check in cx231xx_usb_probe())
are just a few of them.
The patch fixes the issues in cx231xx_usb_probe() and cx231xx_init_dev()
by moving usb_get_dev(interface_to_usbdev(interface)) below in code and
implementing proper error handling.
