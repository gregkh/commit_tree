ARM: OMAP2+: remove legacy support for IGEP boards

Device Tree support for IGEP boards in mainline is almost
finished. The only remaining bits are support for the
Marvell SD8686 wifi + BT and TFP410 DVI chips.

Adding support for these should be straightforward so let's
not block OMAP3 moving to Device Tree only boot and remove
the board file for IGEP boards.
