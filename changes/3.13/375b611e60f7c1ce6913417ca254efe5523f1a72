sysfs: remove sysfs_buffer->ops

Currently, sysfs_ops is fetched during sysfs_open_file() and cached in
sysfs_buffer->ops to be used while the file is open.  This patch
removes the caching and makes each operation directly fetch sysfs_ops.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior difference and is to prepare
for merging regular and bin file supports.
