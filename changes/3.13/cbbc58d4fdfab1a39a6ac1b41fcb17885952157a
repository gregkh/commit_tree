kvm: powerpc: book3s: Allow the HV and PR selection per virtual machine

This moves the kvmppc_ops callbacks to be a per VM entity. This
enables us to select HV and PR mode when creating a VM. We also
allow both kvm-hv and kvm-pr kernel module to be loaded. To
achieve this we move /dev/kvm ownership to kvm.ko module. Depending on
which KVM mode we select during VM creation we take a reference
count on respective module
