tcp: remove redundant code in __tcp_retransmit_skb()

Remove the specialized code in __tcp_retransmit_skb() that tries to trim
any ACKed payload preceding a FIN before we retransmit (this was added
in 1999 in v2.2.3pre3). This trimming code was made unreachable by the
more general code added above it that uses tcp_trim_head() to trim any
ACKed payload, with or without a FIN (this was added in "[NET]: Add
segmentation offload support to TCP." in 2002 circa v2.5.33).
