sched/numa: Continue PTE scanning even if migrate rate limited

Avoiding marking PTEs pte_numa because a particular NUMA node is migrate rate
limited sees like a bad idea. Even if this node can't migrate anymore other
nodes might and we want up-to-date information to do balance decisions.
We already rate limit the actual migrations, this should leave enough
bandwidth to allow the non-migrating scanning. I think its important we
keep up-to-date information if we're going to do placement based on it.
