net: unix: allow set_peek_off to fail

unix_dgram_recvmsg() will hold the readlock of the socket until recv
is complete.

In the same time, we may try to setsockopt(SO_PEEK_OFF) which will hang until
unix_dgram_recvmsg() will complete (which can take a while) without allowing
us to break out of it, triggering a hung task spew.

Instead, allow set_peek_off to fail, this way userspace will not hang.
