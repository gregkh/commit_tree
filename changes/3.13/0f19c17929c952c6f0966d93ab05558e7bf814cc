mm: numa: Do not batch handle PMD pages

With the THP migration races closed it is still possible to occasionally
see corruption. The problem is related to handling PMD pages in batch.
When a page fault is handled it can be assumed that the page being
faulted will also be flushed from the TLB. The same flushing does not
happen when handling PMD pages in batch. Fixing is straight forward but
there are a number of reasons not to

1. Multiple TLB flushes may have to be sent depending on what pages get
   migrated
2. The handling of PMDs in batch means that faults get accounted to
   the task that is handling the fault. While care is taken to only
   mark PMDs where the last CPU and PID match it can still have problems
   due to PID truncation when matching PIDs.
3. Batching on the PMD level may reduce faults but setting pmd_numa
   requires taking a heavy lock that can contend with THP migration
   and handling the fault requires the release/acquisition of the PTL
   for every page migrated. It's still pretty heavy.

PMD batch handling is not something that people ever have been happy
with. This patch removes it and later patches will deal with the
additional fault overhead using more installigent migrate rate adaption.
