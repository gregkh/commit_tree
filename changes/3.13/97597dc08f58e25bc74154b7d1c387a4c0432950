block: Do not call sector_div() with a 64-bit divisor

do_div() (called by sector_div() if CONFIG_LBDAF=y) is meant for divisions
of 64-bit number by 32-bit numbers.  Passing 64-bit divisor types caused
issues in the past on 32-bit platforms, cfr. commit
ea077b1b96e073eac5c3c5590529e964767fc5f7 ("m68k: Truncate base in
do_div()").

As queue_limits.max_discard_sectors and .discard_granularity are unsigned
int, max_discard_sectors and granularity should be unsigned int.
As bdev_discard_alignment() returns int, alignment should be int.
Now 2 calls to sector_div() can be replaced by 32-bit arithmetic:
  - The 64-bit modulo operation can become a 32-bit modulo operation,
  - The 64-bit division and multiplication can be replaced by a 32-bit
    modulo operation and a subtraction.
