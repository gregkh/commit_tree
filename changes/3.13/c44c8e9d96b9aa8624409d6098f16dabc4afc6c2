ARM: ux500: delete devices-common remnants

commit f1ff5b2549990b5de080b52e3313cbb30c218853
"ARM: ux500: Stop enabling GPIOs when not booting with Device Tree"
deleted devices-common.c, but did not delete the build
rule from Makefile (most likely due to compiling in
a dirty tree where the object file still existed so
linking would complete anyway).

Delete the makerule, the header file associated
with this file and the remaining reference to the header.
