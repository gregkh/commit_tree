macvlan: disable LRO on lower device instead of macvlan

A macvlan device has always LRO disabled so that calling
dev_disable_lro() on it does nothing. If we need to disable LRO
e.g. because

  - the macvlan device is inserted into a bridge
  - IPv6 forwarding is enabled for it
  - it is in a different namespace than lowerdev and IPv4
    forwarding is enabled in it

we need to disable LRO on its underlying device instead (as we
do for 802.1q VLAN devices).

v2: use newly introduced netif_is_macvlan()
