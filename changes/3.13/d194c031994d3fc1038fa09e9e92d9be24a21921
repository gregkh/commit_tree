xhci: correct the usage of USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT

The usage of USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT in xhci is incorrect.
The definition of USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT is 5000ms. The
input timeout to wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout
is jiffies. That makes the timeout be longer than what
we want, such as 50s in some platform.

The patch is to use XHCI_CMD_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT instead of
USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT as command completion event timeout.
