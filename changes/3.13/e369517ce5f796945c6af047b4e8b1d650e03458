perf callchain: Convert children list to rbtree

Current collapse stage has a scalability problem which can be reproduced
easily with a parallel kernel build.

This is because it needs to traverse every children of callchains
linearly during the collapse/merge stage.

Converting it to a rbtree reduced the overhead significantly.

On my 400MB perf.data file which recorded with make -j32 kernel build:

  $ time perf --no-pager report --stdio > /dev/null

before:
  real	6m22.073s
  user	6m18.683s
  sys	0m0.706s

after:
  real	0m20.780s
  user	0m19.962s
  sys	0m0.689s

During the perf report the overhead on append_chain_children went down
from 96.69% to 18.16%:

  -  18.16%  perf  perf                [.] append_chain_children
     - append_chain_children
        - 77.48% append_chain_children
           + 69.79% merge_chain_branch
           - 22.96% append_chain_children
              + 67.44% merge_chain_branch
              + 30.15% append_chain_children
              + 2.41% callchain_append
           + 7.25% callchain_append
        + 12.26% callchain_append
        + 10.22% merge_chain_branch
