misc: mic: Bug fix for sysfs poll usage.

MIC user space daemon poll's on sysfs changes. The documentation for
sysfs_poll(...) in fs/sysfs/file.c states that "Once poll/select
indicates that the value has changed, you need to close and re-open the
file, or seek to 0 and read again". This step was missed out earlier and
resulted in the daemon spinning continuously rather than getting blocked
in 'poll'. This bug was exposed by commit aea585ef8fa65163 introduced as
part of sysfs changes in 3.13-rc1. A seek to 0 has been introduced to
fix it.
