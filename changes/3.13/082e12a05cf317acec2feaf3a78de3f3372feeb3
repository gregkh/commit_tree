ACPI / processor: remove unnecessary if (!pr) check

acpi_processor_errata() is only called in acpi_processor_get_info(),
and the argument 'pr' passed to acpi_processor_errata() will never be
NULL, so the if (!pr) check is unnecessary and can be removed.

Since the 'pr' argument is not used by acpi_processor_errata() any more,
so change the argument into void too.
