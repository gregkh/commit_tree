NFS: Add functions to swap transports during migration recovery

Introduce functions that can walk through an array of returned
fs_locations information and connect a transport to one of the
destination servers listed therein.

Note that NFS minor version 1 introduces "fs_locations_info" which
extends the locations array sorting criteria available to clients.
This is not supported yet.
