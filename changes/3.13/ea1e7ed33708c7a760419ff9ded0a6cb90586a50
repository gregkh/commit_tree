mm: create a separate slab for page->ptl allocation

If DEBUG_SPINLOCK and DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC are enabled spinlock_t on x86_64
is 72 bytes.  For page->ptl they will be allocated from kmalloc-96 slab,
so we loose 24 on each.  An average system can easily allocate few tens
thousands of page->ptl and overhead is significant.

Let's create a separate slab for page->ptl allocation to solve this.
