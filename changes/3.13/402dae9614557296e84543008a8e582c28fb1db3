net: add netdev_adjacent->private and allow to use it

Currently, even though we can access any linked device, we can't attach
anything to it, which is vital to properly manage them.

To fix this, add a new void *private to netdev_adjacent and functions
setting/getting it (per link), so that we can save, per example, bonding's
slave structures there, per slave device.

netdev_master_upper_dev_link_private(dev, upper_dev, private) links dev to
upper dev and populates the neighbour link only with private.

netdev_lower_dev_get_private{,_rcu}() returns the private, if found.
