gpiolib: Provide helper macros for logging of GPIO events

Currently many but not all GPIO log messages log the GPIO number and the
formats vary. Ensure that this is done consistently by defining logging
helpers which take the GPIO descriptor.

The will help people pattern matching on logs and providing the number
makes the log messages that omitted it more useful.
