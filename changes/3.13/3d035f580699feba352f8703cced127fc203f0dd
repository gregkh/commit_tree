drivers/char/hpet.c: allow user controlled mmap for user processes

The CONFIG_HPET_MMAP Kconfig option exposes the memory map of the HPET
registers to userspace.  The Kconfig help points out that in some cases
this can be a security risk as some systems may erroneously configure the
map such that additional data is exposed to userspace.

This is a problem for distributions -- some users want the MMAP
functionality but it comes with a significant security risk.  In an effort
to mitigate this risk, and due to the low number of users of the MMAP
functionality, I've introduced a kernel parameter, hpet_mmap_enable, that
is required in order to actually have the HPET MMAP exposed.
