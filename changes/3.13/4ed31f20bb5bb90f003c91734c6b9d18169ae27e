ALSA: dice: fix hang when unplugging a running device

When aborting a PCM stream, the xrun is signaled only if the stream is
running.  When disconnecting a PCM stream, calling snd_card_disconnect()
too early would change the stream into a non-running state and thus
prevent the xrun from being noticed by user space.

To prevent this, move the snd_card_disconnect() call after the xrun.
