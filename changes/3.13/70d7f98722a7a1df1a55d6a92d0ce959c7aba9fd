uprobes: Fix the wrong usage of current->utask in uprobe_copy_process()

Commit aa59c53fd459 "uprobes: Change uprobe_copy_process() to dup
xol_area" has a stupid typo, we need to setup t->utask->vaddr but
the code wrongly uses current->utask.

Even with this bug dup_xol_work() works "in practice", but only
because get_unmapped_area(NULL, TASK_SIZE - PAGE_SIZE) likely
returns the same address every time.
