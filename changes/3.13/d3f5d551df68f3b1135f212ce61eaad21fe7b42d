ARM: OMAP2+: CM: cm_inst offset s16->u16

Most of the AM43x CM reg address offsets are with MSB bit '1' (on
16-bit value) leading to arithmetic miscalculations while calculating
CLOCK ENABLE register's address because cm_inst field was a type of
"const s16", so make it "const u16".

Also modify relevant functions so as to take care of the above.
