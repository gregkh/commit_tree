UBIFS: remove unnecessary code in ubifs_garbage_collect

In ubifs_garbage_collect,local variable "space_before" calculate twice. In
fact, at the beginning of the loop, there is no need to calculate this
variable. Calculate it before call "ubifs_garbage_collect_leb" is enough. This
patch just remove the unnecessary calculate code.
