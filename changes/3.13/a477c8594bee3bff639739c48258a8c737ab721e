x86/cpu: Always print SMP information in /proc/cpuinfo

Currently show_cpuinfo_core() displays cpu core information only if
the number of threads per a whole cores is 2 or larger.

However, this condition doesn't care about the number of
sockets. For example, this condition doesn't hold on systems
with two logical cpus consisting of two sockets and a single
core on each socket - yet the topology information would be
interesting to see in that case as well.

I don't know whether or not there are processors in real world
by which such configurations are possible, but at least on
vitual machine environments, such configuration can occur,
typically when no explicit SMP information is provided in
advance.

For example, on qemu/KVM, SMP information is specified via -smp
command-line option, more specifically, its syntax is:

  -smp n[,cores=cores][,threads=threads][,sockets=sockets][,maxcpus=maxcpus]

If this is not specified, qemu tells configuration with
n-sockets, 1-core and 1-thread to the guest machine, on which
guest, MP information is not displayed in /proc/cpuinfo.

I saw this situation on VMWare guest environment, too.

To fix this issue, this patch simply removes the condition
because this information is useful even if there's only 1
thread.
