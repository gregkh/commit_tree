xfrm: Fix null pointer dereference when decoding sessions

On some codepaths the skb does not have a dst entry
when xfrm_decode_session() is called. So check for
a valid skb_dst() before dereferencing the device
interface index. We use 0 as the device index if
there is no valid skb_dst(), or at reverse decoding
we use skb_iif as device interface index.

Bug was introduced with git commit bafd4bd4dc
("xfrm: Decode sessions with output interface.").
