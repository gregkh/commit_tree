acpi-cpufreq: Add comment under ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_IO case

policy->cur is now set by cpufreq core when cpufreq_driver->get() is defined and
so drivers aren't required to set it. When space_id is ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_IO
for acpi cpufreq driver it doesn't set ->get to a valid function pointer and so
policy->cur is required to be set by driver.

This is already followed in acpi-cpufreq driver. This patch adds a comment
describing why we need to set policy->cur from driver.
