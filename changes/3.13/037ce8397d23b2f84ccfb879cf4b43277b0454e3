cpufreq: rename __cpufreq_set_policy() as cpufreq_set_policy()

Earlier there used to be two functions named __cpufreq_set_policy() and
cpufreq_set_policy(), but now we only have a single routine lets name it
cpufreq_set_policy() instead of __cpufreq_set_policy().

This also removes some invalid comments or fixes some incorrect comments.
