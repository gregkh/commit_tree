drm/i915/bdw: add BDW DDI buf translations for eDP

Broadwell has different DDI buffer translations for eDP and DP, so add
support for the missing eDP and keep Haswell the same.

A future patch addresses the suggestion from Art to check for eDP on
port D and use the eDP values there, too.

v2: Make checkpatch happy.
