raid1: Replace raise_barrier/lower_barrier with freeze_array/unfreeze_array when reconfiguring the array.

We used to use raise_barrier to suspend normal IO while we reconfigure
the array.  However raise_barrier will soon only suspend some normal
IO, not all.  So we need something else.
Change it to use freeze_array.
But freeze_array not only suspends normal io, it also suspends
resync io.
For the place where call raise_barrier for reconfigure, it isn't a
problem.
