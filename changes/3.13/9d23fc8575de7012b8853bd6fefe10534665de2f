xfs: vectorise directory data operations

Following from the initial patches to vectorise the shortform
directory encode/decode operations, convert half the data block
operations to use the vector. The rest will be done in a second
patch.

This further reduces the size of the built binary:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 794490   96802    1096  892388   d9de4 fs/xfs/xfs.o.orig
 792986   96802    1096  890884   d9804 fs/xfs/xfs.o.p1
 792350   96802    1096  890248   d9588 fs/xfs/xfs.o.p2
 789293   96802    1096  887191   d8997 fs/xfs/xfs.o.p3
