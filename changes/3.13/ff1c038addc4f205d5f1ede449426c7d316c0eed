Check SMB3 dialects against downgrade attacks

When we are running SMB3 or SMB3.02 connections which are signed
we need to validate the protocol negotiation information,
to ensure that the negotiate protocol response was not tampered with.

Add the missing FSCTL which is sent at mount time (immediately after
the SMB3 Tree Connect) to validate that the capabilities match
what we think the server sent.

"Secure dialect negotiation is introduced in SMB3 to protect against
man-in-the-middle attempt to downgrade dialect negotiation.
The idea is to prevent an eavesdropper from downgrading the initially
negotiated dialect and capabilities between the client and the server."

For more explanation see 2.2.31.4 of MS-SMB2 or
