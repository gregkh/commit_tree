net: cdc_mbim: change the default to send ZLPs

A number of devices in the wild have turned out to require ZLPs.
Even if this is a spec violation, our priority is to make any
device work as good as possible. Devices needing ZLPs will fail
to receive any full sized frame we send. On the other hand,
devices which do not need the ZLP will still work if we send
them.

This gives us no other option than sending ZLPs by default.

This will prevent devices conforming to the spec from making the
optimizations which are possible without ZLPs.  Adding known
such devices to a whitelist, to avoid the possible negative
impact of the new spec violating default.
