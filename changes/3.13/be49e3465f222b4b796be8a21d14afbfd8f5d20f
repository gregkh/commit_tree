cpufreq: add new routine cpufreq_verify_within_cpu_limits()

Most of the users of cpufreq_verify_within_limits() calls it for
limiting with min/max from policy->cpuinfo. We can make that code
simple by introducing another routine which will do this for them
automatically.

This patch adds another routine cpufreq_verify_within_cpu_limits()
and updates others to use it.
