nfsd: return better errors to exportfs

Someone noticed exportfs happily accepted exports that would later be
rejected when mountd tried to give them to the kernel.  Fix this.

This is a regression from 4c1e1b34d5c800ad3ac9a7e2805b0bea70ad2278
"nfsd: Store ex_anon_uid and ex_anon_gid as kuids and kgids".
