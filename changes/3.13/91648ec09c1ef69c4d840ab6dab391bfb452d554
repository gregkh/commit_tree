powerpc: kvm: fix rare but potential deadlock scene

Since kvmppc_hv_find_lock_hpte() is called from both virtmode and
realmode, so it can trigger the deadlock.

Suppose the following scene:

Two physical cpuM, cpuN, two VM instances A, B, each VM has a group of
vcpus.

If on cpuM, vcpu_A_1 holds bitlock X (HPTE_V_HVLOCK), then is switched
out, and on cpuN, vcpu_A_2 try to lock X in realmode, then cpuN will be
caught in realmode for a long time.

What makes things even worse if the following happens,
  On cpuM, bitlockX is hold, on cpuN, Y is hold.
  vcpu_B_2 try to lock Y on cpuM in realmode
  vcpu_A_2 try to lock X on cpuN in realmode

Oops! deadlock happens
