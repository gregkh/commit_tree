watchdog: Get rid of MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV statements

I just can't find any value in MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV(WATCHDOG_MINOR)
and MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV(TEMP_MINOR) statements.

Either the device is enumerated and the driver already has a module
alias (e.g. PCI, USB etc.) that will get the right driver loaded
automatically.

Or the device is not enumerated and loading its driver will lead to
more or less intrusive hardware poking. Such hardware poking should be
limited to a bare minimum, so the user should really decide which
drivers should be tried and in what order. Trying them all in
arbitrary order can't do any good.

On top of that, loading that many drivers at once bloats the kernel
log. Also many drivers will stay loaded afterward, bloating the output
of "lsmod" and wasting memory. Some modules (cs5535_mfgpt which gets
loaded as a dependency) can't even be unloaded!

If defining char-major-10-130 is needed then it should happen in
user-space.
