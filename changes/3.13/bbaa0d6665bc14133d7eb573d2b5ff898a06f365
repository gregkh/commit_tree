ALSA: hda: add device IDs for AMD Evergreen/Northern Islands HDMI

The device IDs of the AMD Cypress/Juniper/Redwood/Cedar/Cayman/Antilles/
Barts/Turks/Caicos HDMI HDA controllers weren't added explicitly
because the generic entry works, but it made the device appearing as
"Generic", and people are confused as if it's no proper HDMI
controller.  Add them so that the name shows up properly as "ATI HDMI"
instead of "Generic".

According to Takashi's tests and the lack of complaints, these devices
work fine without disabling snooping.
