target: Add per device xcopy_lun for copy offload I/O

This patch adds a se_device->xcopy_lun that is used for local
copy offload I/O, instead of allocating + initializing a pseudo
se_lun for each received EXTENDED_COPY operation.

Also, move declaration of struct se_lun + struct se_port_stat_grps
ahead of struct se_device.
