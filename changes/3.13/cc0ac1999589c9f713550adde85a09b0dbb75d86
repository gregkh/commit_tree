lib: crc32: conditionally resched when running testcases

Fengguang reports that when crc32 selftests are running on startup, on
some e.g. 32bit systems, we can get a CPU stall like "INFO: rcu_sched
self-detected stall on CPU { 0} (t=2101 jiffies g=4294967081 c=4294967080
q=41)". As this is not intended, add a cond_resched() at the end of a
test case to fix it. Introduced by efba721f63 ("lib: crc32: add test cases
for crc32{, c}_combine routines").
