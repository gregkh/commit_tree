vt: properly ignore xterm-256 colour codes

This is not a bug on our side, but a misdesign in ITU T.416, yet with
all popular terminals supporting these codes, people consider this to
be a bug in Linux.  By breaking the design principles behind SGR codes
(gracefully ignoring unsupported ones should not require knowing about
them), 256 colour ones tend to turn blinking on before invoking an
arbitrary unrelated command.

This commit doesn't add such support, merely skips such codes without
ill effects.
