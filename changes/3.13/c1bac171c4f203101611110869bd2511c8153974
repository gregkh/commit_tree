ARM: dts: omap4-panda-es: Do not reset gpio1

Do not reset GPIO1 at boot-up because GPIO 7 in GPIO1 block is used on
OMAP4460 PandaBoard-ES to select voltage register in TPS62361 which
supplies VDD_MPU.

Without this, OMAP4460 PandaBoard-ES boards fail to boot-up because
MPU voltage switches over to VSET0 voltage value (boot voltage) which
is not sufficient to operate the device at OPP100.
