tty: xuartps: Fix build error due to missing forward declaration

If CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled and CONFIG_SERIAL_XILINX_PS_UART_CONSOLE
is not, a forward declaration of the uart_driver struct is not
included, leading to a build error due to an undeclared variable.
Fixing this by moving the definition of the struct uart_driver before
the definition of the suspend/resume callbacks.
