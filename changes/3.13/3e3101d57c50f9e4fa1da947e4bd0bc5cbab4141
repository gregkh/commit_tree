usb: musb: omap2430: use the new generic PHY framework

Use the generic PHY framework API to get the PHY. The usb_phy_set_resume
and usb_phy_set_suspend is replaced with power_on and
power_off to align with the new PHY framework.

musb->xceiv can't be removed as of now because musb core uses xceiv.state and
xceiv.otg. Once there is a separate state machine to handle otg, these can be
moved out of xceiv and then we can start using the generic PHY framework.
