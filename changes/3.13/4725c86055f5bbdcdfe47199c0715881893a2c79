s390: fix save and restore of the floating-point-control register

The FPC_VALID_MASK has been used to check the validity of the value
to be loaded into the floating-point-control register. With the
introduction of the floating-point extension facility and the
decimal-floating-point additional bits have been defined which need
to be checked in a non straight forward way. So far these bits have
been ignored which can cause an incorrect results for decimal-
floating-point operations, e.g. an incorrect rounding mode to be
set after signal return.

The static check with the FPC_VALID_MASK is replaced with a trial
load of the floating-point-control value, see test_fp_ctl.

In addition an information leak with the padding word between the
floating-point-control word and the floating-point registers in
the s390_fp_regs is fixed.
