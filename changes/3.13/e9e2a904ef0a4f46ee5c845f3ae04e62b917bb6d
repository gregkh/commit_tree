be2net: Warn users of possible broken functionality on BE2 cards with very old FW versions with latest driver

On very old FW versions < 4.0, the mailbox command to set interrupts
on the card succeeds even though it is not supported and should have
failed, leading to a scenario where interrupts do not work.
Hence warn users to upgrade to a suitable FW version to avoid seeing
broken functionality.
