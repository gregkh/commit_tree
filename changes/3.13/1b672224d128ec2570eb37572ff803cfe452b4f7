Staging: zram: Fix memory leak by refcount mismatch

As suggested by Minchan Kim and Jerome Marchand "The code in reset_store
get the block device (bdget_disk()) but it does not put it (bdput()) when
it's done using it. The usage count is therefore incremented but never
decremented."

This patch also puts bdput() for all error cases.
