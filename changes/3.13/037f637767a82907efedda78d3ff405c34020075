drivers: clocksource: add support for ARM architected timer event stream

The ARM architected timer can generate events (used for waking up
CPUs executing the wfe instruction) at a frequency represented as a
power-of-2 divisor of the clock rate.

An event stream might be used:
- To implement wfe-based timeouts for userspace locking implementations.
- To impose a timeout on a wfe for safeguarding against any programming
  error in case an expected event is not generated.

This patch computes the event stream frequency aiming for a period
of 100us between events. It uses ARM/ARM64 specific backends to configure
and enable the event stream.
