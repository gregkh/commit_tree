ARC: [SMP] Fix build failures for large NR_CPUS

ST.as only takes S9 (255) for offset. This was going out of range when
accessing a task_struct field with 4k NR_CPUS (due to 128b of coumaks
itself in there).

Workaround by using an intermediate register to do the address scaling.

There is some duplication of fix for ctx_sw.c and ctx_sw_asm.S however
given that C version will go away soon I'm not bothering to factor out
the common code.
