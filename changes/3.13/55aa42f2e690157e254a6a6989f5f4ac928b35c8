efifb: prevent null-deref when iterating dmi_list

The dmi_list array is initialized using gnu designated initializers, and
therefore may contain fewer explicitly defined entries as there are
elements in it. This is because the enum above with M_xyz constants
contains more items than the designated initializer. Those elements not
explicitly initialized are implicitly set to 0.

Now efifb_setup() loops through all these array elements, and performs
a strcmp on each item. For non explicitly initialized elements this will
be a null pointer:

This patch swaps the check order in the if statement, thus checks first
whether dmi_list[i].base is null.
