tty: Prevent tty_port destruction if tty not released

If the tty driver mistakenly drops the last port reference
before the tty has been released, issue a diagnostic and
abort the port destruction.

This will leak memory and may zombify the port, but might
otherwise keep the machine in runnable state.
