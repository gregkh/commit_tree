arm64: big-endian: set correct endianess on kernel entry

The endianness of memory accesses at EL2 and EL1 are configured by
SCTLR_EL2.EE and SCTLR_EL1.EE respectively. When the kernel is booted,
the state of SCTLR_EL{2,1}.EE is unknown, and thus the kernel must
ensure that they are set before performing any memory accesses.

This patch ensures that SCTLR_EL{2,1} are configured appropriately at
boot for kernels of either endianness.
