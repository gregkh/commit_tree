kvm: powerpc: book3s: move book3s_64_vio_hv.c into the main kernel binary

Since the code in book3s_64_vio_hv.c is called from real mode with HV
KVM, and therefore has to be built into the main kernel binary, this
makes it always built-in rather than part of the KVM module.  It gets
called from the KVM module by PR KVM, so this adds an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
