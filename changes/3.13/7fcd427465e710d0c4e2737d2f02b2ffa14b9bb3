mfd: Allow mapping regulator supplies to MFD device from children

Occasionally, it is useful to map supplies from a child device onto the
MFD device. A typical usecase for this would be if the MFD device is
represented as a single node in device tree. All supplies will be
defined in device tree as existing on the MFD device. When a child
depends on frameworks which might have no knowledge of MFD to lookup
supplies on its behalf the supply will not be found.

This patch adds a list of supplies that should be looked up on the
parent rather than the child as part of the mfd_cell structure.
