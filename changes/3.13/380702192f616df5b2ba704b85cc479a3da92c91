ALSA: hda/realtek - Make fixup regs persist after resume

Upon suspend / resume, the fixup register settings are lost because
sending HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE is not part of the resume path. Instead,
write our registers in response to the HDA_FIXUP_ACT_INIT, which happens
after initial probe and upon resume.
