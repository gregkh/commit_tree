random: initialize the last_time field in struct timer_rand_state

Since we initialize jiffies to wrap five minutes before boot (see
INITIAL_JIFFIES defined in include/linux/jiffies.h) it's important to
make sure the last_time field is initialized to INITIAL_JIFFIES.
Otherwise, the entropy estimator will overestimate the amount of
entropy resulting from the first call to add_timer_randomness(),
generally by about 8 bits.
