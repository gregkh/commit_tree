ACPICA: Fix a macro for the hardware-reduced case

This fix repairs a version of a macro that is used for the hardware
reduced case only. It adds a return statement to the macro definition
so that the translation into the Linux kernel source will not completely
delete the second line of the macro because it thinks that it is an empty
block. It actually clarifies the use of the macro anyway.
