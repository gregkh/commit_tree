ipv6: avoid high order memory allocations for /proc/net/ipv6_route

Dumping routes on a system with lots rt6_infos in the fibs causes up to
11-order allocations in seq_file (which fail). While we could switch
there to vmalloc we could just implement the streaming interface for
/proc/net/ipv6_route. This patch switches /proc/net/ipv6_route from
single_open_net to seq_open_net.

loff_t *pos tracks dst entries.

Also kill never used struct rt6_proc_arg and now unused function
fib6_clean_all_ro.
