hfsplus: implement attributes file creation functionality

Implement functionality of creation AttributesFile metadata file on HFS+
volume in the case of absence of it.

It makes trying to open AttributesFile's B-tree during mount of HFS+
volume.  If HFS+ volume hasn't AttributesFile then a pointer on
AttributesFile's B-tree keeps as NULL.  Thereby, when it is discovered
absence of AttributesFile on HFS+ volume in the begin of xattr creation
operation then AttributesFile will be created.

The creation of AttributesFile will have success in the case of
availability (2 * clump) free blocks on HFS+ volume.  Otherwise,
creation operation is ended with error (-ENOSPC).
