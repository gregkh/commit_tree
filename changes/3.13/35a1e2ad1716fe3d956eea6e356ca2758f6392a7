i40e: Cleanup Tx buffer info layout

- drop the mapped_as_page u8 from the Tx buffer info as it was unused
- use the DMA unmap accessors for Tx DMA
- replace checks of DMA with checks of the unmap length to verify if an
  unmap is needed
- update the Tx buffer layout to make it consistent with igb, ixgbe
