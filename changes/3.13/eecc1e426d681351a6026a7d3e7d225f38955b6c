thp: fix copy_page_rep GPF by testing is_huge_zero_pmd once only

We see General Protection Fault on RSI in copy_page_rep: that RSI is
what you get from a NULL struct page pointer.

do_huge_pmd_wp_page() tests is_huge_zero_pmd(orig_pmd) four times: but
since shrink_huge_zero_page() can free the huge_zero_page, and we have
no hold of our own on it here (except where the fourth test holds
page_table_lock and has checked pmd_same), it's possible for it to
answer yes the first time, but no to the second or third test.  Change
all those last three to tests for NULL page.

(Note: this is not the same issue as trinity's DEBUG_PAGEALLOC BUG
in copy_page_rep with RSI: ffff88009c422000, reported by Sasha Levin
in https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/29/103.  I believe that one is due
to the source page being split, and a tail page freed, while copy
is in progress; and not a problem without DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, since
the pmd_same check will prevent a miscopy from being made visible.)
