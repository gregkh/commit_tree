futex: fix handling of read-only-mapped hugepages

The hugepage code had the exact same bug that regular pages had in
commit 7485d0d3758e ("futexes: Remove rw parameter from
get_futex_key()").

The regular page case was fixed by commit 9ea71503a8ed ("futex: Fix
regression with read only mappings"), but the transparent hugepage case
(added in a5b338f2b0b1: "thp: update futex compound knowledge") case
remained broken.
