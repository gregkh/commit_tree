drm/i915: cleanup context fini

I had this lying around from he original PPGTT series, and thought we
might try to get it in by itself.

With the introduction of context refcounting we never explicitly
ref/unref the backing object. As such, the previous fix was a bit wonky.

Aside from fixing the above, this patch also puts us in good shape for
an upcoming patch which allows a failure to occur in between
context_init and the first do_switch.
