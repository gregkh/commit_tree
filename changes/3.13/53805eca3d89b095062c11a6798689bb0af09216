perf tools: Remove cast of non-variadic function to variadic

The 4fb71074a570 (perf ui/hist: Consolidate hpp helpers) cset introduced
a cast of percent_color_snprintf to a function pointer type with
varargs.  Change percent_color_snprintf to be variadic and remove the
cast.

The symptom of this was all percentages being reported as 0.00% in perf
report --stdio output on the armhf arch.
