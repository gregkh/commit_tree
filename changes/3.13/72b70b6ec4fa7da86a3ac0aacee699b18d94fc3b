NFC: Define secure element IO API and commands

In order to send and receive ISO7816 APDUs to and from NFC embedded
secure elements, we define a specific netlink command.
On a typical SE use case, host applications will send very few APDUs
(Less than 10) per transaction. This is why we decided to go for a
simple netlink API. Defining another NFC socket protocol for such low
traffic would have been overengineered.
