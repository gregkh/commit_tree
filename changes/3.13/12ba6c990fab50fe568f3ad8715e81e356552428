x86/UV: Add kdump to UV NMI handler

If a system has hung and it no longer responds to external
events, this patch adds the capability of doing a standard kdump
and system reboot then triggered by the system NMI command.

It is enabled when the nmi action is changed to "kdump" and the
kernel is built with CONFIG_KEXEC enabled.
