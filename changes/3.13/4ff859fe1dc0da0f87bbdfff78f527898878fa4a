ARM: fix footbridge clockevent device

The clockevents code was being told that the footbridge clock event
device ticks at 16x the rate which it actually does.  This leads to
timekeeping problems since it allows the clocksource to wrap before
the kernel notices.  Fix this by using the correct clock.
