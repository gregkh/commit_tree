powerpc/512x: dts: disable MPC5125 usb module

At the moment the USB controller's pin muxing is not setup
correctly and causes a kernel panic upon system startup, so
disable the USB1 device tree node in the MPC5125 tower board
dts file.

The USB controller is connected to an USB3320 ULPI transceiver
and the device tree should receive an update to reflect correct
dependencies and required initialization data before the USB1
node can get re-enabled.
