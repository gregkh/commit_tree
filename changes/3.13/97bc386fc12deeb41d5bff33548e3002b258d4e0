ARC: Add guard macro to uapi/asm/unistd.h

Chen originally proposed this as "right thing to do" however I
actually ran into this when building perf tools. Some of the utils
include unistd.h as well as linux/unistd.h. Since -I includes kernel
headers too, we end up including the ARC unistd.h twice, leading to
redefinition nwarnings.

Verified that make headers_install works fine with this.
