Btrfs: only drop modified extents if we logged the whole inode

If we fsync, seek and write, rename and then fsync again we will lose the
modified hole extent because the rename will drop all of the modified extents
since we didn't do the fast search.  We need to only drop the modified extents
if we didn't do the fast search and we were logging the entire inode as we don't
need them anymore, otherwise this is being premature.  Thanks,
