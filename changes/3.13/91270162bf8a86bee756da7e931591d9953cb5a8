sysfs: skip bin_buffer->buffer while reading

After b31ca3f5dfc ("sysfs: fix deadlock"), bin read() first writes
data to bb->buffer and bounces it to a transient kernel buffer which
is then copied out to userland.  The double bouncing doesn't add
anything.  Let's just use the transient buffer directly.

While at it, rename @temp to @buf for clarity.
