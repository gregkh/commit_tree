ARM: shmobile: bockw: add R-Car sound support (PIO)

This patch enables R-Car sound,
AK4643 (CN19) and AK4554 (CN20/CN21) codec chip
on Bock-W.

But, it supports PIO transfer only at this point.
User can check sound settings (Dip-switch/PFC etc)
via this patch, but will get under/over flow error
when playback/capture.
Because PIO transfer via SSI will be interrupted
"sampling rate" times per 1 second.

DMA transfer will be supported when HPB-DMAC was
enabled on r8a7778.

You will notice strange ALSA sound card HW
numbering on Bock-W board.
This came from AK4554 strange format on playback/capture.
The format on playback/capture is same on "normal" codec chip,
but AK4554 was different.
Because of that, AK4554 playback/capture are
registered as a different sound card.
