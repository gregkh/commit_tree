gpio: mvebu: make mvchip->irqbase signed for error handling

There is a bug in mvebu_gpio_probe() where we do:

	mvchip->irqbase = irq_alloc_descs(-1, 0, ngpios, -1);
	if (mvchip->irqbase < 0) {

The problem is that mvchip->irqbase is unsigned so the error handling
doesn't work.  I have changed it to be a regular int.
