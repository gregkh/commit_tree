mmc: msm_sdcc: Move away from using deprecated APIs

Suspend and resume of cards are being handled from the protocol layer
and consequently the mmc_suspend|resume_host APIs are deprecated.

This means we can simplify the suspend|resume callbacks by removing the
use of the deprecated APIs.

Additionally, remove dead code which also used the deprecated APIs.
