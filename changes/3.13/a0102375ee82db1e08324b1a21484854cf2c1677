regmap: Add regmap_fields APIs

Current Linux kernel is supporting regmap_field method
and it is very useful feature.
It needs one regmap_filed for one register access.

OTOH, there is multi port device which
has many same registers in the market.
The difference for each register access is
only its address offset.

Current API needs many regmap_field for such device,
but it is not good.
This patch adds new regmap_fileds API which can care
about multi port/offset access via regmap.
