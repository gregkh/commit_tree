xen/mcfg: Call PHYSDEVOP_pci_mmcfg_reserved for MCFG areas.

The PCI MMCONFIG area is usually reserved via the E820 so the Xen hypervisor
is aware of these regions. But they can also be enumerated in the ACPI
DSDT which means the hypervisor won't know of them until the initial
domain informs it of via PHYSDEVOP_pci_mmcfg_reserved.

This is what this patch does for all of the MCFG regions that the
initial domain is aware of (E820 enumerated and ACPI).
