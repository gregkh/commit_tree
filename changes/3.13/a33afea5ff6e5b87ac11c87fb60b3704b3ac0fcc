drm/i915: Keep a list of all contexts

I have implemented this patch before without creating a separate list
(I'm having trouble finding the links, but the messages ids are:
<1364942743-6041-2-git-send-email-ben@bwidawsk.net>
<1365118914-15753-9-git-send-email-ben@bwidawsk.net>)

However, the code is much simpler to just use a list and it makes the
code from the next patch a lot more pretty.

As you'll see in the next patch, the reason for this is to be able to
specify when a context needs to get L3 remapping. More details there.
