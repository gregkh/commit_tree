Btrfs: cleanup reserved space when freeing tree log on error

On error we will wait and free the tree log at unmount without a transaction.
This means that the actual freeing of the blocks doesn't happen which means we
complain about space leaks on unmount.  So to fix this just skip the transaction
specific cleanup part of the tree log free'ing if we don't have a transaction
and that way we can free up our reserved space and our counters stay happy.
