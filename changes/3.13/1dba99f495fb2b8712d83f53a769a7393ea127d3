drm/i915: Rename intel_flush_display_plane to intel_flush_primary_plane

The intel_flush_primary_plane name actually tells us which plane
we're talking about.

Also reorganize the internals a bit and add a missing POSTING_READ()
to make sure the hardware has seen the changes by the time we
return from the function.
