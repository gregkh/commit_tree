powerpc/pci: Change the DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_{HEADER => EARLY} macro of pci quirk

Freescale platform has class code = 0x0b2000, when it boots. This makes
kernel PCI bus code to setup these devices resulting into the following
notice information when trying to enable them:

pci 0000:00:00.0: ignoring class 0x0b2000 (doesn't match header type 01)

The above information is outputted by judging value of dev->class before
pci_setup_device() function, and the DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER quirk runs
after pci_setup_device() function. But the DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY quirk
runs before judging value of dev->class and pci_setup_device() function.
So we use the DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY macro to fix this issue.
