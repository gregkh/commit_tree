parisc: make udelay() SMP-safe

Each CPU has it's own Control Register 16 (CR16) which is used as time source
for the udelay() function. But since the CR16 registers across different CPUs
are not synced, we need to recalculate the loop count if we get switched away
to ensure that we really delay as much time as requested.
