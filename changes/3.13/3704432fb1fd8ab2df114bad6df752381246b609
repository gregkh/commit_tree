iio: refactor info mask and ext_info attribute creation.

Introduce an enum to specify whether the attribute is separate or
shared.

Factor out the bitmap handling for loop into a separate function.

Tidy up error handling and add a NULL assignment to squish a false
positive warning from GCC.

Change ext_info shared type from boolean to enum and update in all
drivers.
