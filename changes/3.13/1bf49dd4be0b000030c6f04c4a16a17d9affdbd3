./Makefile: export initial ramdisk compression config option

Make menuconfig allows one to choose compression format of an initial
ramdisk image.  But this choice does not result in duly compressed ramdisk
image.  Because - $ make install - does not pass on the selected
compression choice to the dracut(8) tool, which creates the initramfs
file.  dracut(8) generates the image with the default compression, ie.
gzip(1).

This patch exports the selected compression option to a sub-shell
environment, so that it could be used by dracut(8) tool to generate
appropriately compressed initramfs images.

There isn't a straightforward way to pass on options to dracut(8) via
positional parameters.  Because it is indirectly invoked at the end of a $
make install sequence.

 # make install
   -> arch/$arch/boot/Makefile
    -> arch/$arch/boot/install.sh
     -> /sbing/installkernel ...
      -> /sbin/new-kernel-pkg ...
       -> /sbin/dracut ...
