Btrfs: add a sanity test for btrfs_split_item

While looking at somebodys corruption I became completely convinced that
btrfs_split_item was broken, so I wrote this test to verify that it was working
as it was supposed to.  Thankfully it appears to be working as intended, so just
add this test to make sure nobody breaks it in the future.  Thanks,
