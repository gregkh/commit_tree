ARM: OMAP3: fix dpll4_m3_ck and dpll4_m4_ck dividers

dpll4_m3_ck and dpll4_m4_ck have divider bit fields which are 6 bits
wide. However, only values from 1 to 32 are allowed. This means we have
to add a divider tables and list the dividers explicitly.

I believe the same issue is there for other dpll4_mx_ck clocks, but as
I'm not familiar with them, I didn't touch them.
