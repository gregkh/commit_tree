gpiolib: use dedicated flags for GPIO properties

GPIO mapping properties were defined using the GPIOF_* flags, which are
declared in linux/gpio.h. This file is not included when using the
GPIO descriptor interface.

This patch declares the flags that can be used as GPIO mappings
properties in linux/gpio/driver.h, and uses them in gpiolib, so that no
deprecated declarations are used by the GPIO descriptor interface.

This patch also allows GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN and GPIO_OPEN_SOURCE to be
specified as GPIO mapping properties.
