netconsole: fix NULL pointer dereference

We need to disable the netconsole (enabled = 0) before setting nt->np.dev
to NULL because otherwise we might still have users after the
netpoll_cleanup() since nt->enabled is set afterwards and we can
have a message which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.
It is very easy to hit dereferences all over the netpoll_send_udp function
by running the following two loops in parallel:
while [ 1 ]; do echo 1 > enabled; echo 0 > enabled; done;
while [ 1 ]; do echo 00:11:22:33:44:55 > remote_mac; done;
(the second loop is to generate messages, it can be done by anything)

We're safe to set nt->np.dev = NULL and nt->enabled = 0 with the spinlock
since it's required in the write_msg() function.
