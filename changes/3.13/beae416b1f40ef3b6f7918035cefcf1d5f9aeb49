net: wireless: ath9k: avoid possible NULL pointer dereference

Code in ath9k_hw_set_clockrate function indicates that ah->curchan
(and thus chan local variable) may be NULL.  If that is indeed the
case, IS_CHAN_HT40(chan) check has to be performed only in branch
where chan is not NULL.  Moving the code under already existing
if condition fixes this issue.
