net: 6lowpan: fix lowpan_header_create non-compression memcpy call

In function lowpan_header_create(), we invoke the following code
construct:

  struct ipv6hdr *hdr;
  ...
  hdr = ipv6_hdr(skb);
  ...
  if (...)
    memcpy(hc06_ptr + 1, &hdr->flow_lbl[1], 2);
  else
    memcpy(hc06_ptr, &hdr, 4);

Where the else path of the condition, that is, non-compression
path, calls memcpy() with a pointer to struct ipv6hdr *hdr as
source, thus two levels of indirection. This cannot be correct,
and likely only one level of pointer was intended as source
buffer for memcpy() here.
