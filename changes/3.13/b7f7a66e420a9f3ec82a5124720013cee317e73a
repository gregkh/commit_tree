NFS: Support NFS4ERR_LEASE_MOVED recovery in state manager

A migration on the FSID in play for the current NFS operation
is reported via the error status code NFS4ERR_MOVED.

"Lease moved" means that a migration has occurred on some other
FSID than the one for the current operation.  It's a signal that
the client should take action immediately to handle a migration
that it may not have noticed otherwise.  This is so that the
client's lease does not expire unnoticed on the destination server.

In NFSv4.0, a moved lease is reported with the NFS4ERR_LEASE_MOVED
error status code.

To recover from NFS4ERR_LEASE_MOVED, check each FSID for that server
to see if it is still present.  Invoke nfs4_try_migration() if the
FSID is no longer present on the server.
