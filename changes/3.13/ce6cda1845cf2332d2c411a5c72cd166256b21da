NFS: Add a super_block backpointer to the nfs_server struct

NFS_SB() returns the pointer to an nfs_server struct, given a
pointer to a super_block.  But we have no way to go back the other
way.

Add a super_block backpointer field so that, given an nfs_server
struct, it is easy to get to the filesystem's root dentry.
