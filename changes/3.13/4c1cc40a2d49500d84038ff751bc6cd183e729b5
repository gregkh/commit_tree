Revert "KEYS: verify a certificate is signed by a 'trusted' key"

This reverts commit 09fbc47373826d67531380662b516de2da120545, which
caused the following build errors:

  crypto/asymmetric_keys/x509_public_key.c: In function ‘x509_key_preparse’:
  crypto/asymmetric_keys/x509_public_key.c:237:35: error: ‘system_trusted_keyring’ undeclared (first use in this function)
   ret = x509_validate_trust(cert, system_trusted_keyring);
                                   ^
  crypto/asymmetric_keys/x509_public_key.c:237:35: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

reported by Jim Davis. Mimi says:

 "I made the classic mistake of requesting this patch to be upstreamed
  at the last second, rather than waiting until the next open window.

  At this point, the best course would probably be to revert the two
  commits and fix them for the next open window"
