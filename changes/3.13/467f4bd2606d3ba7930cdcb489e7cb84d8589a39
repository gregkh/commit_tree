ARM: dts: Fix omap2 specific dtsi files by adding the missing entries

Looks like we're missing few entries for omap2 and the drivers
have only worked because of the omap hwmod building the devices
for the missing entries.

Let's fix the missing entries so we don't need to rely on hwmod
for the basic data and can then later on remove the duplicate
data from hwmod. Otherwise device tree only drivers will not
work properly.
