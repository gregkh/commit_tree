cpufreq: pmac64: speed up frequency switch

Some functions on switch path use msleep() which is inaccurate, and
depends on HZ. With HZ=100 msleep(1) takes actually over ten times longer.
Using usleep_range() we get more accurate sleeps.

I measured the "pfunc_slewing_done" polling to take 300us at max (on
2.3GHz dual-processor Xserve G5), so using 500us sleep there should
be fine.

With the patch, g5_switch_freq() duration drops from ~50ms to ~10ms on
Xserve with HZ=100.
