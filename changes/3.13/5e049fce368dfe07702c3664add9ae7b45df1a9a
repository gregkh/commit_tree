ASoC: tegra: support new register layouts in Tegra124

Tegra124 introduces some small changes to the layout of some registers.
Modify the affected drivers to program those registers appropriately
based on which SoC they're running on.

Tegra124 also introduced some new modules on the AHUB configlink register
bus. These will require new entries in configlink_clocks[] in the AHUB
driver. However, supporting that change likely relies on switching Tegra
to the common reset framework, so I'll defer that change for now.
