Bluetooth: Add new mgmt setting for LE advertising

This patch adds a new mgmt setting for LE advertising and hooks up the
necessary places in the mgmt code to operate on the HCI_LE_PERIPHERAL
flag (which corresponds to this setting). This patch does not yet add
any new command for enabling the setting - that is left for a subsequent
patch.
