Squashfs: Restructure squashfs_readpage()

Restructure squashfs_readpage() splitting it into separate
functions for datablocks, fragments and sparse blocks.

Move the memcpying (from squashfs cache entry) implementation of
squashfs_readpage_block into file_cache.c

This allows different implementations to be supported.
