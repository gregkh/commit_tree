inet: prevent leakage of uninitialized memory to user in recv syscalls

Only update *addr_len when we actually fill in sockaddr, otherwise we
can return uninitialized memory from the stack to the caller in the
recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg syscalls. Drop the the (addr_len == NULL)
checks because we only get called with a valid addr_len pointer either
from sock_common_recvmsg or inet_recvmsg.

If a blocking read waits on a socket which is concurrently shut down we
now return zero and set msg_msgnamelen to 0.
