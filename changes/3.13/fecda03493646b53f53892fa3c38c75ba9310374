net: sctp: fix ASCONF to allow non SCTP_ADDR_SRC addresses in ipv6

Commit 8a07eb0a50 ("sctp: Add ASCONF operation on the single-homed host")
implemented possible use of IPv4 addresses with non SCTP_ADDR_SRC state
as source address when sending ASCONF (ADD) packets, but IPv6 part for
that was not implemented in 8a07eb0a50. Therefore, as this is not restricted
to IPv4-only, fix this up to allow the same for IPv6 addresses in SCTP.
