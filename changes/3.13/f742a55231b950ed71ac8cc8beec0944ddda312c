drm/i915: fix pm init ordering

Shovel a bit more of the the code into the setup function, and call
it earlier. Otherwise lockdep is unhappy since we cancel the delayed
resume work before it's initialized.

While at it also shovel the pc8 setup code into the same functions.
I wanted to also ditch the header declaration of the hws pc8 functions,
but for unfathomable reasons that stuff is in intel_display.c instead
of intel_pm.c.
