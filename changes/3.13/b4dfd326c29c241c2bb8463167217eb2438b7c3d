ibm emac: Don't call napi_complete if napi_reschedule failed

This patch fixes a bug which would trigger the BUG_ON() at
net/core/dev.c:4156. It was found that this was due to continuing
processing in the current poll call even when the call to
napi_reschedule failed, indicating the device was already on the
polling list. This resulted in an extra call to napi_complete which
triggered the BUG_ON().

This patch ensures that we only contine processing rotting packets in
the current mal_poll call if we are not already on the polling list.
