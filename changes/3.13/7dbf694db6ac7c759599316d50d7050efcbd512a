cpufreq: distinguish drivers that do asynchronous notifications

There are few special cases like exynos5440 which doesn't send POSTCHANGE
notification from their ->target() routine and call some kind of bottom halves
for doing this work, work/tasklet/etc.. From which they finally send POSTCHANGE
notification.

Its better if we distinguish them from other cpufreq drivers in some way so that
core can handle them specially. So this patch introduces another flag:
CPUFREQ_ASYNC_NOTIFICATION, which will be set by such drivers.

This also changes exynos5440-cpufreq.c and powernow-k8 in order to set this
flag.
