mei: move host_clients_map cleanup to device init

Move host_clients_map cleanup from host client init to device init.

This fixes bug where we cleaned up the bitmask that servers as pool for
host client ids while file descriptors are kept open during suspend.
On resume a new connection will be assigned id that is already taken
by opened file descriptor. Consequently read/write will fail due to
mismatched book keeping.
