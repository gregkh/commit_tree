net: checksum: fix warning in skb_checksum

This patch fixes a build warning in skb_checksum() by wrapping the
csum_partial() usage in skb_checksum(). The problem is that on a few
architectures, csum_partial is used with prefix asmlinkage whereas
on most architectures it's not. So fix this up generically as we did
with csum_block_add_ext() to match the signature. Introduced by
2817a336d4d ("net: skb_checksum: allow custom update/combine for
walking skb").
