ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix SOFTRESET logic

In _ocp_softreset(), after _set_softreset() + write_sysconfig(),
the hwmod's sysc_cache will always contain SOFTRESET bit set
so all further writes to sysconfig using this cache will initiate
a repeated SOFTRESET e.g. enable_sysc(). This is true for OMAP3 like
platforms that have RESET_DONE status in the SYSSTATUS register and
so the the SOFTRESET bit in SYSCONFIG is not automatically cleared.
It is not a problem for OMAP4 like platforms that indicate RESET
completion by clearing the SOFTRESET bit in the SYSCONFIG register.

This repeated SOFTRESET is undesired and was the root cause of
USB host issues on OMAP3 platforms when hwmod was allowed to do the
SOFTRESET for the USB Host module.

To fix this we clear the SOFTRESET bit and update the sysconfig
register + sysc_cache using write_sysconfig().
