xfs: remove xfsbdstrat error

The xfsbdstrat helper is a small but useless wrapper for xfs_buf_iorequest that
handles the case of a shut down filesystem.  Most of the users have private,
uncached buffers that can just be freed in this case, but the complex error
handling in xfs_bioerror_relse messes up the case when it's called without
a locked buffer.

Remove xfsbdstrat and opencode the error handling in the callers.  All but
one can simply return an error and don't need to deal with buffer state,
and the one caller that cares about the buffer state could do with a major
cleanup as well, but we'll defer that to later.
