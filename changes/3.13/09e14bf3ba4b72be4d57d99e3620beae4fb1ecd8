drm/i915: Capture the initial error-state when kicking stuck rings

We lost the ability to capture the first error for a stuck ring in the
recent hangcheck robustification. Whilst both error states are
interesting (why does the GPU not recover is also essential to debug),
our primary goal is to fix the initial hang and so we need to capture
the first error state upon taking hangcheck action.
