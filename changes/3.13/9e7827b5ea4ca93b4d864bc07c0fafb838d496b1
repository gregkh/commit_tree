x86, hyperv: Get the local APIC timer frequency from the hypervisor

Hyper-V supports a mechanism for retrieving the local APIC frequency.
Use this and bypass the calibration code in the kernel . This would
allow us to boot the Linux kernel as a "modern VM" on Hyper-V where
many of the legacy devices (such as PIT) are not emulated.

I would like to thank Olaf Hering <olaf@aepfle.de>, Jan Beulich <JBeulich@suse.com> and
H. Peter Anvin <h.peter.anvin@intel.com> for their help in this effort.

In this version of the patch, I have addressed Jan's comments.
