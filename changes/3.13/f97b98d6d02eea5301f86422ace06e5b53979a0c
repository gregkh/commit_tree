dma: cppi41: add support for suspend and resume

This patch adds support for suspend/resume functionality to the cppi41
DMA driver. The steps necessary to make the system resume properly were
figured out by trial-and-error. The code as it stands now is the
minimum that has to be done to put the musb host system on an AM33xx
system into an operable state after resume.
