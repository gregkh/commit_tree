random: speed up the fast_mix function by a factor of four

By mixing the entropy in chunks of 32-bit words instead of byte by
byte, we can speed up the fast_mix function significantly.  Since it
is called on every single interrupt, on systems with a very heavy
interrupt load, this can make a noticeable difference.

Also fix a compilation warning in add_interrupt_randomness() and avoid
xor'ing cycles and jiffies together just in case we have an
architecture which tries to define random_get_entropy() by returning
jiffies.
