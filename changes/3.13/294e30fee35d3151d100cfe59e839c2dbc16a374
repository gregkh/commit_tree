Btrfs: add tests for find_lock_delalloc_range

So both Liu and I made huge messes of find_lock_delalloc_range trying to fix
stuff, me first by fixing extent size, then him by fixing something I broke and
then me again telling him to fix it a different way.  So this is obviously a
candidate for some testing.  This patch adds a pseudo fs so we can allocate fake
inodes for tests that need an inode or pages.  Then it addes a bunch of tests to
make sure find_lock_delalloc_range is acting the way it is supposed to.  With
this patch and all of our previous patches to find_lock_delalloc_range I am sure
it is working as expected now.  Thanks,
