pinctrl: single: call pcs_soc->rearm() whenever IRQ mask is changed

On OMAPs the IO ring must be rearmed each time the pad wakeup
configuration is changed. So call pcs_soc->rearm() from
pcs_irq_set().

As pinctrl-single is now an interrupt controller in some cases,
we should follow the standards and keep the interrupts enabled
constantly, and not just for wake-up events. The tracking of
runtime vs wake-up interrupts can be handled separately for
the automated runtime PM solution when we have it in the
future.
