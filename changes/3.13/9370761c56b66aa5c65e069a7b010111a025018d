netfilter: nf_tables: convert built-in tables/chains to chain types

This patch converts built-in tables/chains to chain types that
allows you to deploy customized table and chain configurations from
userspace.

After this patch, you have to specify the chain type when
creating a new chain:

 add chain ip filter output { type filter hook input priority 0; }
                              ^^^^ ------

The existing chain types after this patch are: filter, route and
nat. Note that tables are just containers of chains with no specific
semantics, which is a significant change with regards to iptables.
