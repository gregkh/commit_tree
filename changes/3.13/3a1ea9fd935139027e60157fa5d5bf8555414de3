rtlwifi: remove duplicate declarations and macros in headers

This patch brings no functional change.

There are still duplicate macros across the rtlwifi directory, for example
IQK_DELAY_TIME is defined multiple times, sometimes with different values,
this patch only removes duplicates within the same header file.
