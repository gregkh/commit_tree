perf/trace: Properly use u64 to hold event_id

The 64-bit attr.config value for perf trace events was being copied into
an "int" before doing a comparison, meaning the top 32 bits were
being truncated.

As far as I can tell this didn't cause any errors, but it did mean
it was possible to create valid aliases for all the tracepoint ids
which I don't think was intended.  (For example, 0xffffffff00000018
and 0x18 both enable the same tracepoint).
