sfc: Poll for MCDI completion once before timeout occurs

There is an as-yet unexplained bug that sometimes prevents (or delays)
the driver seeing the completion event for a completed MCDI request on
the SFC9120.  The requested configuration change will have happened
but the driver assumes it to have failed, and this can result in
further failures.  We can mitigate this by polling for completion
after unsuccessfully waiting for an event.
