clocksource: sunxi: Stop timer from ticking before enabling interrupts

The sun4i timer can still be ticking when we enable the interrupt.
If another timer is actually used (A7 architected timer, for example),
odds are that the interrupt will eventually fire with the event_handler
pointer being NULL.

The obvious fix it to stop the timer before registering the interrupt.

Observed and tested on sun7i (cubietruck).
