block/partitions/efi.c: fix bound check

Use ARRAY_SIZE instead of sizeof to get proper max for label length.

Since this is just a read out of bounds it's not that bad, but the
problem becomes user-visible eg if one tries to use DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and
DEBUG_RODATA, at least with some enhancements from Hiroshi.  Of course
the destination array can contain garbage when we read beyond the end of
source array so that would be another user-visible problem.
