s390,time: revert direct ktime path for s390 clockevent device

Git commit 4f37a68cdaf6dea833cfdded2a3e0c47c0f006da
"s390: Use direct ktime path for s390 clockevent device" makes use
of the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_KTIME clockevent option to avoid the delta
calculation with ktime_get() in clockevents_program_event and the
get_tod_clock() in s390_next_event. This is based on the assumption
that the difference between the internal ktime and the hardware
clock is reflected in the wall_to_monotonic delta. But this is not
true, the ntp corrections are applied via changes to the tk->mult
multiplier and this is not reflected in wall_to_monotonic.

In theory this could be solved by using the raw monotonic clock
but it is simpler to switch back to the standard clock delta
calculation.
