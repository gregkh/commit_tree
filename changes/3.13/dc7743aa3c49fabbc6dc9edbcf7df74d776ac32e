pinctrl: single: Add support for auxdata

For omaps, we still have dependencies to the legacy code
for handling the PRM (Power Reset Management) interrupts,
and also for reconfiguring the io wake-up chain after
changes.

Let's pass the PRM interrupt and the rearm functions via
auxdata. Then when at some point we have a proper PRM
driver, we can get the interrupt via device tree and
set up the rearm function as exported function in the
PRM driver.

By using auxdata we can remove a dependency to the
wake-up events for converting omap3 to be device
tree only.
