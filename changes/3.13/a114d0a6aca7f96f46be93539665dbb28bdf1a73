i40e: Split bytes and packets from Rx/Tx stats

This makes it so that the Tx and Rx byte and packet counts are
separated from the rest of the statistics.  This allows for better
isolation of these stats when we move them into the 64 bit statistics.

Simplify things by re-ordering how the stats display in ethtool.
Instead of displaying all of the Tx queues as a block, followed by all
the Rx queues, the new order is Tx[0], Rx[0], Tx[1], Rx[1], ..., Tx[n],
Rx[n].  This reduces the loops and cleans up the display for testing
purposes since it is very easy to verify if flow director is doing the
right thing as the Tx and Rx queue pair are shown in pairs.
