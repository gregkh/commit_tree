x86, efi: Don't use (U)EFI time services on 32 bit

UEFI time services are often broken once we're in virtual mode. We were
already refusing to use them on 64-bit systems, but it turns out that
they're also broken on some 32-bit firmware, including the Dell Venue.
Disable them for now, we can revisit once we have the 1:1 mappings code
incorporated.
