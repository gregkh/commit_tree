be2net: Fix Lancer error recovery to distinguish FW download

The Firmware update would be detected by looking at the sliport_error1/
sliport_error2 register values(0x02/0x00). If its not a FW reset the current
messaging would take place. If the error is due to FW reset, log a message to
user that "Firmware update in progress" and also do not log sliport_status and
sliport_error register values.
