genetlink: register family ops as array

Instead of using a linked list, use an array. This reduces
the data size needed by the users of genetlink, for example
in wireless (net/wireless/nl80211.c) on 64-bit it frees up
over 1K of data space.

Remove the attempted sending of CTRL_CMD_NEWOPS ctrl event
since genl_ctrl_event(CTRL_CMD_NEWOPS, ...) only returns
-EINVAL anyway, therefore no such event could ever be sent.
