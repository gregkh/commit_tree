perf tools: Add time argument on COMM setting

This way we can later delimit a lifecycle for the COMM and map a hist to
a precise COMM:timeslice couple.

PERF_RECORD_COMM and PERF_RECORD_FORK events that don't have
PERF_SAMPLE_TIME samples can only send 0 value as a timestamp and thus
should overwrite any previous COMM on a given thread because there is no
sensible way to keep track of all the comms lifecycles in a thread
without time informations.
