arm64: update 32-bit kuser helpers to ARMv8

This patch updates the barrier semantics in the kuser helper functions
to take advantage of the ARMv8 additions to AArch32, which are
guaranteed to be available in situations where these functions will be
called.

Note that this slightly changes the cmpxchg functions in that they are
no longer necessarily full barriers if they return 1. However, the
documentation only states they include their own barriers "as needed",
not that they are obligated to act as a full barrier for the caller.
