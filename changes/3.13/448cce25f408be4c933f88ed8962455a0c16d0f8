drm: Implement timings adjustments for frame packing

When using the frame packing and a single big framebuffer, some hardware
requires that we do everything like if we were scanning out the big
buffer itself. Let's instrument drm_mode_set_crtcinfo() to be able to do
this adjustement if the driver is asking for it.

    reconstructing it (Ville Syrj채l채)
