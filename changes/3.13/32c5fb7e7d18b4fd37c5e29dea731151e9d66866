perf: Kill the dead !vma->vm_mm code in perf_event_mmap_event()

1. perf_event_mmap(vma) is never called with a gate_vma-like arg,
   remove the "if (!vma->vm_mm)" code.

2. arch_vma_name() can use the chached value of mmap_event->vma.

3. Change the code to not call arch_vma_name() twice.

4. Purely cosmetic, but since we use "goto got_name" all the time
   remove "else" from "[stack]" branch just for symmetry.
