powernv: Fix VFIO support with PHB3

I have recently found out that no iommu_groups could be found under
/sys/ on a P8. That prevents PCI passthrough from working.

During my investigation, I found out there seems to be a missing
iommu_register_group for PHB3. The following patch seems to fix the
problem. After applying it, I see iommu_groups under
/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/, and can also bind vfio-pci to an adapter,
which gives me a device at /dev/vfio/.
