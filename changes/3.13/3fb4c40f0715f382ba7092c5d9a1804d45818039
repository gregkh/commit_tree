KVM: s390: Split up __vcpu_run into three parts

In preparation for the following patch (which will change the indentation
of __vcpu_run quite a bit), this patch puts most of the code from __vcpu_run
into separate functions. The first function handles the code that runs
before the SIE instruction and the other one handles the code that runs
afterwards.
