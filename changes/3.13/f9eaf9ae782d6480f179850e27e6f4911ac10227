drm/radeon: rework and fix reset detection v2

Stop fiddling with jiffies, always wait for RADEON_FENCE_JIFFIES_TIMEOUT.
Consolidate the two wait sequence implementations into just one function.
Activate all waiters and remember if the reset was already done instead of
trying to reset from only one thread.

v2: clear reset flag earlier to avoid timeout in IB test
