net: flow_dissector: fail on evil iph->ihl

We don't validate iph->ihl which may lead a dead loop if we meet a IPIP
skb whose iph->ihl is zero. Fix this by failing immediately when iph->ihl
is evil (less than 5).

This issue were introduced by commit ec5efe7946280d1e84603389a1030ccec0a767ae
(rps: support IPIP encapsulation).
