ALSA: hda - hdmi: Fix IEC958 ctl indexes for some simple HDMI devices

In case a single HDA card has both HDMI and S/PDIF outputs, the S/PDIF
outputs will have their IEC958 controls created starting from index 16
and the HDMI controls will be created starting from index 0.

However, HDMI simple_playback_build_controls() as used by old VIA and
NVIDIA codecs incorrectly requests the IEC958 controls to be created
with an S/PDIF type instead of HDMI.
In case the card has other codecs that have HDMI outputs, the controls
will be created with wrong index=16, causing them to e.g. be unreachable
by the ALSA "hdmi" alias.

Fix that by making simple_playback_build_controls() request controls
with HDMI indexes.

Not many cards have an affected configuration, but e.g. ASUS M3N78-VM
contains an integrated NVIDIA HDA "card" with:
- a VIA codec that has, among others, an S/PDIF pin incorrectly
  labelled as an HDMI pin, and
- an NVIDIA MCP7x HDMI codec.
