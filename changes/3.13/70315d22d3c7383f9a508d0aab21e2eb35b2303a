inet_diag: fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() to use correct state for timewait sockets

Fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() to reflect the fact that both TCP_TIME_WAIT
and TCP_FIN_WAIT2 connections are represented by inet_timewait_sock
(not just TIME_WAIT), and for such sockets the tw_substate field holds
the real state, which can be either TCP_TIME_WAIT or TCP_FIN_WAIT2.

This brings the inet_diag state-matching code in line with the field
it uses to populate idiag_state. This is also analogous to the info
exported in /proc/net/tcp, where get_tcp4_sock() exports sk->sk_state
and get_timewait4_sock() exports tw->tw_substate.

Before fixing this, (a) neither "ss -nemoi" nor "ss -nemoi state
fin-wait-2" would return a socket in TCP_FIN_WAIT2; and (b) "ss -nemoi
state time-wait" would also return sockets in state TCP_FIN_WAIT2.

This is an old bug that predates 05dbc7b ("tcp/dccp: remove twchain").
