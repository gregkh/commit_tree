drm/i915: Convert execbuf code to use vmas

In order to transition more of our code over to using a VMA instead of
an <OBJ, VM> pair - we must have the vma accessible at execbuf time. Up
until now, we've only had a VMA when actually binding an object.

The previous patch helped handle the distinction on bound vs. unbound.
This patch will help us catch leaks, and other issues before we actually
shuffle a bunch of stuff around.

This attempts to convert all the execbuf code to speak in vmas. Since
the execbuf code is very self contained it was a nice isolated
conversion.

The meat of the code is about turning eb_objects into eb_vma, and then
wiring up the rest of the code to use vmas instead of obj, vm pairs.

Unfortunately, to do this, we must move the exec_list link from the obj
structure. This list is reused in the eviction code, so we must also
modify the eviction code to make this work.

WARNING: This patch makes an already hotly profiled path slower. The cost is
unavoidable. In reply to this mail, I will attach the extra data.

v2: Release table lock early, and two a 2 phase vma lookup to avoid
having to use a GFP_ATOMIC. (Chris)

v3: s/obj_exec_list/obj_exec_link/
