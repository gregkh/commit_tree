drm/i915/bdw: PPGTT init & cleanup

Aside from the potential size increase of the PPGTT, the primary
difference from previous hardware is the Page Directories are no longer
carved out of the Global GTT.

Note that the PDE allocation is done as a 8MB contiguous allocation,
this needs to be eventually fixed (since driver reloading will be a
pain otherwise). Also, this will be a no-go for real PPGTT support.

v2: Move vtable initialization

v3: Resolve conflicts due to patch series reordering.

v4: Rebase on top of the address space refactoring of the PPGTT
support. Drop Imre's r-b tag for v2, too outdated by now.

v5: Free the correct amount of memory, "get_order takes size not a page
count." (Imre)
