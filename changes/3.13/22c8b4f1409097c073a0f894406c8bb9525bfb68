cpufreq: sa11x0: Expose frequency table

This patch exposes sa11x0's frequency table to cpufreq core. It always existed
but not as an array frequencies and not in the format cpufreq core wants it to.
Also it was present in the unit of 100kHz earlier which is made consistent with
cpufreq core now, i.e. kHz.
