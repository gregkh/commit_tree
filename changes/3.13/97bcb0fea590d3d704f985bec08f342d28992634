ARM: set BE8 if LE in head code

If we are booting in LE and compiled for BE8, then add code to
set the state to bE8. Since the instruction stream is always LE,
we do not need to do anything special to the instruction.

Also ensure that the secondary processors are started in the same mode.

Note, we do add about 20 bytes to the kernel image, but it seems easier
to do this than adding another configuration to change.
