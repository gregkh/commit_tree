rcu: Distinguish between NOCB and non-NOCB rcu_callback trace events

One way to distinguish between NOCB and non-NOCB rcu_callback trace
events is that the former always print zero for the lazy and non-lazy
queue lengths.  Unfortunately, this also means that we cannot see the NOCB
queue lengths.  This commit therefore accesses the NOCB queue lengths,
but negates them.  NOCB rcu_callback trace events should therefore have
negative queue lengths.
