KVM: ARM: Fix calculation of virtual CPU ID

KVM does not have a notion of multiple clusters for CPUs, just a linear
array of CPUs. When using a system with cores in more than one cluster, the
current method for calculating the virtual MPIDR will leak the (physical)
cluster information into the virtual MPIDR. One effect of this is that
Linux under KVM fails to boot multiple CPUs that aren't in the 0th cluster.

This patch does away with exposing the real MPIDR fields in favour of simply
using the virtual CPU number (but preserving the U bit, as before).
