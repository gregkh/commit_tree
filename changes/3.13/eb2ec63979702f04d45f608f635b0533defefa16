staging: ft1000: function write_dpram32_and_check extracted from write_blk

function write_blk is long and overly complex, consisting of a triply
nested loop. It also has improper indentation and line lengths
throughout, and has return type of u32 rather than int. Some of the
lines, when converted to proper indentation, create checkpatch warnings
for too many leading tabs.

This patch extracts the innermost loop into its own function,
write_dpram32_and_check. This removes several levels of indentation from
the extracted lines and makes the original function simpler. Two local
variables from the original function, u16 resultbuffer[] and a loop
counter, have been made local variables of the new function. Two calls
to msleep() have been replaced with usleep_range() as per Documentation/
timers/timers-howto.txt (which was referred to in a checkpatch warning).
Several other style issues in the extracted code have been corrected as
well.
