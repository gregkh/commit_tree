drbd: fix decoding of bitmap vli rle for device sizes > 64 TB

Symptoms: disconnect after bitmap exchange due to
bitmap overflow (e:49731075554) while decoding bm RLE packet

In the decoding step of the variable length integer run length encoding
there was potentially an uncatched bitshift by wordsize (variable >> 64).

The result of which is "undefined" :(
(only "sometimes" the result is the desired 0)

Fix: don't do any bit shift magic for shift == 64, just assign.
