ARM: OMAP2+: Add quirk support for legacy platform data init

We want to drop the board-*.c files but keep things working.
Let's make it a bit easier to support legacy platform data
init with quirks. This also keeps board-generic.c clean from
board specific hacks.

For now, the quirks table is empty, that is populated
in the later patches.
