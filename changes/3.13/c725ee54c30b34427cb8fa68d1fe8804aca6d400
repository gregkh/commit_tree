gen_init_cpio: avoid NULL pointer dereference and rework env expanding

getenv() may return NULL if given environment variable does not exist
which leads to NULL dereference when calling strncat.

Besides that, the environment variable name was copied to a temporary
env_var buffer, but this copying can be avoided by simply using the input
string.

Lastly, the whole loop can be greatly simplified by using the snprintf
function instead of the playing with strncat.

 By the way, the current implementation allows a recursive variable
 expansion, as in:

   $ echo 'out ${A} out ' | A='a ${B} a' B=b /tmp/a
   out a b a out

 I'm assuming this is just a side effect and not a conscious decision
 (especially as this may lead to infinite loop), but I didn't want to
 change this behaviour without consulting.

 If the current behaviour is deamed incorrect, I'll be happy to send
 a patch without recursive processing.
