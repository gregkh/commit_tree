x86/UV: Fix NULL pointer dereference in uv_flush_tlb_others() if the 'nobau' boot option is used

The SGI UV tlb shootdown code panics the system with a NULL
pointer deference if 'nobau' is specified on the boot
commandline.

uv_flush_tlb_other() gets called for every flush, whether the
BAU is disabled or not.  It should not be keeping the s_enters
statistic while the BAU is disabled.

The panic occurs because during initialization
init_per_cpu_tunables() does not set the bcp->statp pointer if
'nobau' was specified.
