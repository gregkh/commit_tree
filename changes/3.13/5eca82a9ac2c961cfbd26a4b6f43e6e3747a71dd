sched/numa: Cure update_numa_stats() vs. hotplug

Because we're completely unserialized against hotplug its well
possible to try and generate numa stats for an offlined node.

Bail out early (and avoid a /0) in this case. The resulting stats are
all 0 which should result in an undesirable balance target -- not to
mention that actually trying to migrate to an offline CPU will fail.
