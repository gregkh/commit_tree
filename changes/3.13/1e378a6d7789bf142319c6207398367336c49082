dma: cppi41: redo descriptor collection in abort case

Most of the logic here is try and error since what actually happens does
not match the trm or I miss read it.
My first assumption was that the queue on which the tear-down descriptor
completes (their own complete queue vs "active descriptor" complete
queue) depends on the transfer direction. This seems not to be true
because I manage to trigger
|  WARN_ON(c->desc_phys != desc_phys);
and the other few were fine means the tear-down descriptor was valid but
on different queue.

This patch changes the logic here to look on both queues for the
descriptor.
