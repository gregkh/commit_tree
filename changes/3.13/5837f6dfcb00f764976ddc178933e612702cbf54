NFS: stop using NFS_MOUNT_SECFLAVOUR server flag

Since the parsed sec= flavor is now stored in nfs_server->auth_info,
we no longer need an nfs_server flag to determine if a sec= option was
used.

This flag has not been completely removed because it is still needed for
the (old but still supported) non-text parsed mount options ABI
compatability.
