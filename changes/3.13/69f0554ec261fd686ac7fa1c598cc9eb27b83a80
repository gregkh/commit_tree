init/Kconfig: add option to disable kernel compression

Some ARC users say they can boot faster with without kernel compression.
This probably depends on things like the FLASH chip they use etc.

Until now, kernel compression can only be disabled by removing "select
HAVE_<compression>" lines from the architecture Kconfig.  So add the
Kconfig logic to permit disabling of kernel compression.
