xen-netback: fix fragment detection in checksum setup

The code to detect fragments in checksum_setup() was missing for IPv4 and
too eager for IPv6. (It transpires that Windows seems to send IPv6 packets
with a fragment header even if they are not a fragment - i.e. offset is zero,
and M bit is not set).

This patch also incorporates a fix to callers of maybe_pull_tail() where
skb->network_header was being erroneously added to the length argument.
