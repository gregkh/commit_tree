staging: comedi: 8255_pci: fix for newer PCI-DIO48H

At some point, Measurement Computing / ComputerBoards redesigned the
PCI-DIO48H to use a PLX PCI interface chip instead of an AMCC chip.
This meant they had to put their hardware registers in the PCI BAR 2
region instead of PCI BAR 1.  Unfortunately, they kept the same PCI
device ID for the new design.  This means the driver recognizes the
newer cards, but doesn't work (and is likely to screw up the local
configuration registers of the PLX chip) because it's using the wrong
region.

Since  the PCI subvendor and subdevice IDs were both zero on the old
design, but are the same as the vendor and device on the new design, we
can tell the old design and new design apart easily enough.  Split the
existing entry for the PCI-DIO48H in `pci_8255_boards[]` into two new
entries, referenced by different entries in the PCI device ID table
`pci_8255_pci_table[]`.  Use the same board name for both entries.
