bcache: Explicitly track btree node's parent

This is prep work for the reworked btree insertion code.

The way we set b->parent is ugly and hacky... the problem is, when
btree_split() or garbage collection splits or rewrites a btree node, the
parent changes for all its (potentially already cached) children.

I may change this later and add some code to look through the btree node
cache and find all our cached child nodes and change the parent pointer
then...
