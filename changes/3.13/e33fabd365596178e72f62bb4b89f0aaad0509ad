regmap: new API regmap_multi_reg_write() definition

New API regmap_multi_reg_write() is defined that allows a set of reg,val
pairs to be written to a I2C client device as one block transfer from the
point of view of a single I2C master system.

A simple demonstration implementation is included that just splits the
block write request into a sequence of single register writes.

The implementation will be modified later to support those I2C clients
that implement the alternative non-standard MULTIWRITE block write mode
so to achieve a single I2C transfer that will be atomic even in multiple
I2C master systems.
