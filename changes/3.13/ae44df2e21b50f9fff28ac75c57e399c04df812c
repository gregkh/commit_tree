usb: musb: call musb_start() only once in OTG mode

In commit 001dd84 ("usb: musb: start musb on the udc side, too") it was
ensured that the state engine is started also in OTG mode after a
removal / insertion of the gadget.
Unfortunately this change also introduced a bug: If the device is
configured as OTG and it connected with a remote host _without_ loading
a gadget then we bug() later (because musb->otg->gadget is not
initialized).
Initially I assumed it might be nice to have the host part of musb in
OTG mode working without having a gadget loaded. This bug and fact that
it wasn't working like this before the host/gadget split made me realize
that this was a silly idea.
This patch now introduces back the old behavior where in OTG mode the
host mode is only working after the gadget has been loaded.
