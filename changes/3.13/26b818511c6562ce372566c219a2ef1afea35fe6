mfd: rtsx: Modify rts5249_optimize_phy

In some platforms, specially Thinkpad series, rts5249 won't be
initialized properly. So we need adjust some phy parameters to
improve the compatibility issue.

It is a little different between simulation and real chip. We have
no idea about which configuration is better before tape-out. We set
default settings according to simulation, but need to tune these
parameters after getting the real chip.

I can't explain every change in detail here. The below information is
just a rough description:

PHY_REG_REV: Disable internal clkreq_tx, enable rx_pwst
PHY_BPCR: No change, just turn the magic number to macro definitions
PHY_PCR: Change OOBS sensitivity, from 60mV to 90mV
PHY_RCR2: Control charge-pump current automatically
PHY_FLD4: Use TX cmu reference clock
PHY_RDR: Change RXDSEL from 30nF to 1.9nF
PHY_RCR1: Change the duration between adp_st and asserting cp_en from
0.32 us to 0.64us
PHY_FLD3: Adjust internal timers
PHY_TUNE: Fine tune the regulator12 output voltage
