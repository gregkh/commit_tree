SUNRPC: Modify synopsis of rpc_client_register()

The rpc_client_register() helper was added in commit e73f4cc0,
"SUNRPC: split client creation routine into setup and registration,"
Mon Jun 24 11:52:52 2013.  In a subsequent patch, I'd like to invoke
rpc_client_register() from a context where a struct rpc_create_args
is not available.
