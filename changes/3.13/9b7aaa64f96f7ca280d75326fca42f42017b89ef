dm thin: allow pool in read-only mode to transition to read-write mode

A thin-pool may be in read-only mode because the pool's data or metadata
space was exhausted.  To allow for recovery, by adding more space to the
pool, we must allow a pool to transition from PM_READ_ONLY to PM_WRITE
mode.  Otherwise, running out of space will render the pool permanently
read-only.
