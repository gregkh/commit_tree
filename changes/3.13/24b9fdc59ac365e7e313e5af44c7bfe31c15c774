kernel/bounds: avoid circular dependencies in generated headers

<linux/spinlock.h> has heavy dependencies on other header files.
It triggers circular dependencies in generated headers on IA64, at
least:

  CC      kernel/bounds.s
In file included from /home/space/kas/git/public/linux/arch/ia64/include/asm/thread_info.h:9:0,
                 from include/linux/thread_info.h:54,
                 from include/asm-generic/preempt.h:4,
                 from arch/ia64/include/generated/asm/preempt.h:1,

/home/space/kas/git/public/linux/arch/ia64/include/asm/asm-offsets.h:1:35: fatal error: generated/asm-offsets.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Let's replace <linux/spinlock.h> with <linux/spinlock_types.h>, it's
enough to find out size of spinlock_t.
