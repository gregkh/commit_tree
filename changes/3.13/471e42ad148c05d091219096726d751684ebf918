usb: wusbcore: fix deadlock in wusbhc_gtk_rekey

When multiple wireless USB devices are connected and one of the devices
disconnects, the host will distribute a new group key to the remaining
devicese using wusbhc_gtk_rekey.  wusbhc_gtk_rekey takes the
wusbhc->mutex and holds it while it submits a URB to set the new key.
This causes a deadlock in wa_urb_enqueue when it calls a device lookup
helper function that takes the same lock.

This patch changes wusbhc_gtk_rekey to submit a work item to set the GTK
so that the URB is submitted without holding wusbhc->mutex.
