sysfs: honor bin_attr.attr.ignore_lockdep

ignore_lockdep is currently honored only for regular files.  There's
no reason to ignore it for bin files.  Update sysfs_ignore_lockdep()
so that bin_attr.attr.ignore_lockdep works too.

While this doesn't have any in-kernel user, this unifies the behaviors
between regular and bin files and will help later changes.
