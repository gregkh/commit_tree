perf/x86/amd/ibs: Fix waking up from S3 for AMD family 10h

On AMD family 10h we see following error messages while waking up from
S3 for all non-boot CPUs leading to a failed IBS initialization:

 Enabling non-boot CPUs ...
 smpboot: Booting Node 0 Processor 1 APIC 0x1
 [Firmware Bug]: cpu 1, try to use APIC500 (LVT offset 0) for vector 0x400, but the register is already in use for vector 0xf9 on another cpu
 perf: IBS APIC setup failed on cpu #1
 process: Switch to broadcast mode on CPU1
 CPU1 is up
 ...
 ACPI: Waking up from system sleep state S3

Reason for this is that during suspend the LVT offset for the IBS
vector gets lost and needs to be reinialized while resuming.

The offset is read from the IBSCTL msr. On family 10h the offset needs
to be 1 as offset 0 is used for the MCE threshold interrupt, but
firmware assings it for IBS to 0 too. The kernel needs to reprogram
the vector. The msr is a readonly node msr, but a new value can be
written via pci config space access. The reinitialization is
implemented for family 10h in setup_ibs_ctl() which is forced during
IBS setup.

This patch fixes IBS setup after waking up from S3 by adding
resume/supend hooks for the boot cpu which does the offset
reinitialization.

Marking it as stable to let distros pick up this fix.
