dcache: fix outdated DCACHE_NEED_LOOKUP comment

The DCACHE_NEED_LOOKUP case referred to here was removed with
39e3c9553f34381a1b664c27b0c696a266a5735e "vfs: remove
DCACHE_NEED_LOOKUP".

There are only four real_lookup() callers and all of them pass in an
unhashed dentry just returned from d_alloc.
