xen/arm: pfn_to_mfn and mfn_to_pfn return the argument if nothing is in the p2m

Some common Xen drivers, like balloon.c, call pfn_to_mfn and mfn_to_pfn
even for autotranslate guests, expecting the argument back.
The following commit broke these drivers by changing the behavior of
pfn_to_mfn and mfn_to_pfn:

    arm/xen,arm64/xen: introduce p2m

They now return INVALID_P2M_ENTRY if Linux doesn't actually know what is
the mfn backing a pfn or what is the pfn corresponding to an mfn.
Fix the regression by switching to the old behavior.
