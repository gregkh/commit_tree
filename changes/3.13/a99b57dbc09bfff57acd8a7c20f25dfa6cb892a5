drm: Move the GET_CAP macros next to the corresponding ioctl structure

It's a tiny bit more logical to find the different capabilities you can
use with the GET_CAP ioctl next to the structure rather than putting
them at the end of the file.

v2: Tab align the litterals (David Herrmann)
v3: Make it clearer that DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT/IMPORT are flags of
    DRM_CAP_PRIME.
v4: Rebase on top of latest bits (DRM_CAP_ASYNC_PAGE_FLIP was
    introduced)
