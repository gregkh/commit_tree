ARM: 7872/1: Support arch_irq_work_raise() via self IPIs

By default, IRQ work is run from the tick interrupt (see
irq_work_run() in update_process_times()). When we're in full
NOHZ mode, restarting the tick requires the use of IRQ work and
if the only place we run IRQ work is in the tick interrupt we
have an unbreakable cycle. Implement arch_irq_work_raise() via
self IPIs to break this cycle and get the tick started again.
Note that we implement this via IPIs which are only available on
SMP builds. This shouldn't be a problem because full NOHZ is only
supported on SMP builds anyway.
