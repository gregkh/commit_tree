perf test: Update command line callchain attribute tests

The "struct perf_event_attr setup" entry in 'perf test' is in fact a
series of tests that will exec the tools, passing different sets of
command line arguments to then intercept the sys_perf_event_open
syscall, in user space, to check that the perf_event_attr->sample_type
and other feature request bits are setup as expected.

We recently restored the callchain requesting command line argument, -g,
to not require a parameter ("dwarf" or "fp"), instead using a default
("fp" for now) and making the long option variant, --call-chain, be the
one to be used when a different callchain collection method is
preferred.

The "struct perf_event_attr setup" test failed because we forgot to
update the tests involving callchains, not switching from, '-g dwarf' to
'--call-chain dwarf', making 'perf test' detect it:

  [root@sandy ~]# perf test -v 13
  13: struct perf_event_attr setup                           :

  ---- end ----
  struct perf_event_attr setup: FAILED!
  [root@sandy ~]#

Fix all of them now to use --call-chain when explicitely specifying a
method.

There is still work to do, as '-g fp', for instance, passed without
problems.

In that case 'perf test' saw no problems as the intercepted syscall got
the bits as expected, i.e. the default is 'fp', but the fact that 'fp'
may be an existing program and the specified workload would then be
passed as a parameter to it is an usability problem that needs fixing.

Next merge window tho.
