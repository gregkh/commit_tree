fuse: writepages: protect secondary requests from fuse file release

All async fuse requests must be supplied with extra reference to a fuse
file.  This is necessary to ensure that the fuse file is not released until
all in-flight requests are completed.  Fuse secondary writeback requests
must obey this rule as well.
