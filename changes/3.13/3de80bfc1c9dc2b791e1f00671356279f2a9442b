Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-spear suspend"

This reverts commit 36a8758736238c9354f46b39ca506e9acabe82d0.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
