spi: spi-mxs: Remove bogus setting of ssp clk rate field

The ssp struct has a clock rate field, to provide the actual value, in Hz,
of the SSP output clock (the rate of SSP_SCK) after mxs_ssp_set_clk_rate()
is called.  It is set by mxs_ssp_set_clk_rate(), for SSP using drivers (like
SPI and MMC) to *read* if they want to know the actual clock rate.  The SPI
driver isn't supposed to *write* to it.

For some reason the spi-mxs driver decides to write to this field on init,
and sets it to the value of the SSP input clock (clk_sspN, from the MXS
clocking block) in kHz.  It shouldn't be setting the value, and certainly
shouldn't be setting it with the wrong clock in the wrong units.
