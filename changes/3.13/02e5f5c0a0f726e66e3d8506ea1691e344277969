md: fix calculation of stacking limits on level change.

The various ->run routines of md personalities assume that the 'queue'
has been initialised by the blk_set_stacking_limits() call in
md_alloc().

However when the level is changed (by level_store()) the ->run routine
for the new level is called for an array which has already had the
stacking limits modified.  This can result in incorrect final
settings.

So call blk_set_stacking_limits() before ->run in level_store().

A specific consequence of this bug is that it causes
discard_granularity to be set incorrectly when reshaping a RAID4 to a
RAID0.

This is suitable for any -stable kernel since 3.3 in which
blk_set_stacking_limits() was introduced.
