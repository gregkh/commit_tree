mm: numa: serialise parallel get_user_page against THP migration

Base pages are unmapped and flushed from cache and TLB during normal
page migration and replaced with a migration entry that causes any
parallel NUMA hinting fault or gup to block until migration completes.

THP does not unmap pages due to a lack of support for migration entries
at a PMD level.  This allows races with get_user_pages and
get_user_pages_fast which commit 3f926ab945b6 ("mm: Close races between
THP migration and PMD numa clearing") made worse by introducing a
pmd_clear_flush().

This patch forces get_user_page (fast and normal) on a pmd_numa page to
go through the slow get_user_page path where it will serialise against
THP migration and properly account for the NUMA hinting fault.  On the
migration side the page table lock is taken for each PTE update.
