staging: comedi: pcl711: tidy up the subdevice init

For aesthetic reasons, add some whitespace to the subdevice init.

The 's->len_chanlist' is only used with asynchronous command support.
Remove the unnecessary initialization of this member in the subdevices
that do not support commands. For the analog input subdevice, move
the initialization so it only occurs when commands are supported.
