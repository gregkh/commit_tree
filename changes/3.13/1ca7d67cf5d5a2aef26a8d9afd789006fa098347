seqcount: Add lockdep functionality to seqcount/seqlock structures

Currently seqlocks and seqcounts don't support lockdep.

After running across a seqcount related deadlock in the timekeeping
code, I used a less-refined and more focused variant of this patch
to narrow down the cause of the issue.

This is a first-pass attempt to properly enable lockdep functionality
on seqlocks and seqcounts.

Since seqcounts are used in the vdso gettimeofday code, I've provided
non-lockdep accessors for those needs.

I've also handled one case where there were nested seqlock writers
and there may be more edge cases.

Comments and feedback would be appreciated!
