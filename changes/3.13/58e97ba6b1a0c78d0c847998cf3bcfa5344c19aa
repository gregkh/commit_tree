frontswap: enable call to invalidate area on swapoff

During swapoff the frontswap_map was NULL-ified before calling
frontswap_invalidate_area().  However the frontswap_invalidate_area()
exits early if frontswap_map is NULL.  Invalidate was never called
during swapoff.

This patch moves frontswap_map_set() in swapoff just after calling
frontswap_invalidate_area() so outside of locks (swap_lock and
swap_info_struct->lock).  This shouldn't be a problem as during swapon
the frontswap_map_set() is called also outside of any locks.
