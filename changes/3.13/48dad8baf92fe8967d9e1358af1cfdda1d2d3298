bcache: Add btree_map() functions

Lots of stuff has been open coding its own btree traversal - which is
generally pretty simple code, but there are a few subtleties.

This adds new new functions, bch_btree_map_nodes() and
bch_btree_map_keys(), which do the traversal for you. Everything that's
open coding btree traversal now (with the exception of garbage
collection) is slowly going to be converted to these two functions;
being able to write other code at a higher level of abstraction  is a
big improvement w.r.t. overall code quality.
