ipv4: introduce new IP_MTU_DISCOVER mode IP_PMTUDISC_INTERFACE

Sockets marked with IP_PMTUDISC_INTERFACE won't do path mtu discovery,
their sockets won't accept and install new path mtu information and they
will always use the interface mtu for outgoing packets. It is guaranteed
that the packet is not fragmented locally. But we won't set the DF-Flag
on the outgoing frames.

Florian Weimer had the idea to use this flag to ensure DNS servers are
never generating outgoing fragments. They may well be fragmented on the
path, but the server never stores or usees path mtu values, which could
well be forged in an attack.

(The root of the problem with path MTU discovery is that there is
no reliable way to authenticate ICMP Fragmentation Needed But DF Set
messages because they are sent from intermediate routers with their
source addresses, and the IMCP payload will not always contain sufficient
information to identify a flow.)

Recent research in the DNS community showed that it is possible to
implement an attack where DNS cache poisoning is feasible by spoofing
fragments. This work was done by Amir Herzberg and Haya Shulman:
<https://sites.google.com/site/hayashulman/files/fragmentation-poisoning.pdf>

This issue was previously discussed among the DNS community, e.g.
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsext/current/msg01204.html>,
without leading to fixes.

This patch depends on the patch "ipv4: fix DO and PROBE pmtu mode
regarding local fragmentation with UFO/CORK" for the enforcement of the
non-fragmentable checks. If other users than ip_append_page/data should
use this semantic too, we have to add a new flag to IPCB(skb)->flags to
suppress local fragmentation and check for this in ip_finish_output.

Many thanks to Florian Weimer for the idea and feedback while implementing
this patch.
