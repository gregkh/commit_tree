arm64: fix access to preempt_count from assembly code

preempt_count is defined as an int. Oddly enough, we access it
as a 64bit value. Things become interesting when running a BE
kernel, and looking at the current CPU number, which is stored
as an int next to preempt_count. Like in a per-cpu interrupt
handler, for example...

Using a 32bit access fixes the issue for good.
