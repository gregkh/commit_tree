dm cache: add passthrough mode

"Passthrough" is a dm-cache operating mode (like writethrough or
writeback) which is intended to be used when the cache contents are not
known to be coherent with the origin device.  It behaves as follows:

* All reads are served from the origin device (all reads miss the cache)
* All writes are forwarded to the origin device; additionally, write
  hits cause cache block invalidates

This mode decouples cache coherency checks from cache device creation,
largely to avoid having to perform coherency checks while booting.  Boot
scripts can create cache devices in passthrough mode and put them into
service (mount cached filesystems, for example) without having to worry
about coherency.  Coherency that exists is maintained, although the
cache will gradually cool as writes take place.

Later, applications can perform coherency checks, the nature of which
will depend on the type of the underlying storage.  If coherency can be
verified, the cache device can be transitioned to writethrough or
writeback mode while still warm; otherwise, the cache contents can be
discarded prior to transitioning to the desired operating mode.
