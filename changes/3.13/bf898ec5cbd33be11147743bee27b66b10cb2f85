powerpc/eeh: Enable PCI_COMMAND_MASTER for PCI bridges

On PHB3, we will fail to fetch IODA tables without PCI_COMMAND_MASTER
on PCI bridges. According to one experiment I had, the MSIx interrupts
didn't raise from the adapter without the bit applied to all upstream
PCI bridges including root port of the adapter. The patch forces to
have that bit enabled accordingly.
