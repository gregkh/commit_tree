cxgb4: Reserve stid 0 for T4/T5 adapters

When creating offload server entries, an IPv6 passive connection request
can trigger a reply with a null STID, whereas the driver would expect
the reply 'STID to match the value used for the request.
This happens due to h/w limitation on T4 and T5.

This patch ensures that STID 0 is never used if the stid range starts
from zero.
