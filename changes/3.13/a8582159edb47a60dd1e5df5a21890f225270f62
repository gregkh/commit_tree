cifs: don't spam the logs on unexpected lookup errors

Andrey reported that he was seeing cifs.ko spam the logs with messages
like this:

    CIFS VFS: Unexpected lookup error -26

He was listing the root directory of a server and hitting an error when
trying to QUERY_PATH_INFO against hiberfil.sys and pagefile.sys. The
right fix would be to switch the lookup code over to using FIND_FIRST,
but until then we really don't need to report this at a level of
KERN_ERR. Convert this message over to FYI level.
