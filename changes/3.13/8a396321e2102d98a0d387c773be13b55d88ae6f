HID: kye: fix unresponsive keyboard

The manticore keyboard requires that all usb EP are opened at least
once to be fully functional. The third EP forwards to the user space
some vendor specific information about the keyboard state, but are useless
currently for the kernel.

Opening them and closing them makes the keyboard responsive again.
