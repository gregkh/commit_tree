ARM64: DT: define ARM64 specific arch_match_cpu_phys_id

OF/DT core library provides architecture specific hook to match the
logical cpu index with the corresponding physical identifier.

On ARM64, the MPIDR_EL1 contains specific bitfields(MPIDR_EL1.Aff{3..0})
which uniquely identify a CPU, in addition to some non-identifying
information and reserved bits. The ARM cpu binding defines the 'reg'
property to only contain the affinity bits, and any cpu nodes with other
bits set in their 'reg' entry are skipped.

This patch overrides the weak definition of arch_match_cpu_phys_id
with ARM64 specific version using MPIDR_EL1.Aff{3..0} as cpu physical
identifiers.
