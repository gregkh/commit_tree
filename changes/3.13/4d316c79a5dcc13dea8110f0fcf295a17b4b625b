ath10k: align RX frames properly

Ethernet-like decapping mode leaves IP protocol
frame not aligned to 4-byte boundaries. This leads
to re-aligning in mac80211 which in turn leads to
poor CPU cache behaviour on some machines.

Since HW doesn't allow to change payload offset
properly the solution is to force HW to decap in
Native Wifi mode which always has 24-bytes long
802.11 header (even for QoS frames). This means IP
frame is properly aligned in this decap mode.
