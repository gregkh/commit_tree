USB: fix substandard locking for the sysfs files

This patch straightens out some locking issues in the USB sysfs
interface:

	Deauthorization will destroy existing configurations.
	Attributes that read from udev->actconfig need to lock the
	device to prevent races.  Likewise for the rawdescriptor
	values.

	Attributes that access an interface's current alternate
	setting should use ACCESS_ONCE() to obtain the cur_altsetting
	pointer, to protect against concurrent altsetting changes.

	The supports_autosuspend() attribute routine accesses values
	from an interface's driver, so it should lock the interface
	(rather than the usb_device) to protect against concurrent
	unbinds.  Once this is done, the routine can be simplified
	considerably.

Scalar values that are stored directly in the usb_device structure are
always available.  They do not require any locking.  The same is true
of the cached interface string descriptor, because it is not
deallocated until the usb_host_interface structure is destroyed.
