mm: numa: Limit NUMA scanning to migrate-on-fault VMAs

There is a 90% regression observed with a large Oracle performance test
on a 4 node system. Profiles indicated that the overhead was due to
contention on sp_lock when looking up shared memory policies. These
policies do not have the appropriate flags to allow them to be
automatically balanced so trapping faults on them is pointless. This
patch skips VMAs that do not have MPOL_F_MOF set.
