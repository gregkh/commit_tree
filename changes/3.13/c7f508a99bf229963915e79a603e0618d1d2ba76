Allow setting per-file compression via CIFS protocol

An earlier patch allowed setting the per-file compression flag

"chattr +c filename"

on an smb2 or smb3 mount, and also allowed lsattr to return
whether a file on a cifs, or smb2/smb3 mount was compressed.

This patch extends the ability to set the per-file
compression flag to the cifs protocol, which uses a somewhat
different IOCTL mechanism than SMB2, although the payload
(the flags stored in the compression_state) are the same.
