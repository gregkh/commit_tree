s390/dasd: validate request size before building CCW/TCW request

An I/O request that does not read or write full blocks cannot be
translated into a correct CCW or TCW program and should be rejected
right away. In particular the code that creates TCW requests will not
notice this problem and create broken TCWs that will be rejected by
the hardware.
