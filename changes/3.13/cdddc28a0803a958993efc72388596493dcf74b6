Staging: crystalhd: Fix assignment of 0/1 to bool variables

Convert 0 to false and 1 to true when assigning values to bool
variables. Inspired by commit 3db1cd5c05f35fb43eb134df6f321de4e63141f2.

The simplified semantic patch that find this problem is as
follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

@@
bool b;
@@
(
-b = 0
+b = false
|
-b = 1
+b = true
)
