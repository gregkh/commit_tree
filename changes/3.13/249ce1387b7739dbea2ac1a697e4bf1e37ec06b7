ASoC: dapm: Add support for virtual mixer controls

This patch adds support for virtual DAPM mixer controls. They are similar to
virtual DAPM enums. There is no hardware register backing the control, so
changing the control's value wont have any direct effect on the hardware. But it
still influences the DAPM graph by causing the path it sits on to be connected
or disconnected. This in turn can cause power changes for some of the widgets on
the DAPM graph, which will then modify the hardware state.
