ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: AM335x/AM43x: move common data

AM335x and AM43x have most of the IP's and interconnect's similar.
Instead of adding redundant hwmod data, move interconnects and hwmod
similar between AM335x and AM43x to a common location. This helps in
reuse on AM43x.

AM335x interconnects that has difference and not present in AM43x are
not moved. ocp clock of those in l4_wkup is fed from a different source
for AM43x. Also pruss interconnect is different.

AM335x hwmod's that has difference other than prcm register offsets
(difference is in clocks of wkup_m3, control, gpio0, debugss and clock
domain of l4_hs, adc_tsc as compared to AM43x) and those that are not
present in AM43x are not moved.
