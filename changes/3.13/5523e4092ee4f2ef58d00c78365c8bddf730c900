ARM: OMAP5/DRA7: realtime_counter: Configure CNTFRQ register

The realtime counter called master counter, produces the count
used by the private timer peripherals in the MPU_CLUSTER. The
CNTFRQ per cpu register is used to denote the frequency of the counter.
Currently the frequency value is passed from the
DT file, but this is not scalable when we have other non-DT guest
OS. This register must be set to the right value by the
secure rom code. Setting this register helps in propagating the right
frequency value across OSes.

More discussions and the reason for adding this in a non-DT
way can be seen from below.

So configuring this secure register for all the cpus here.
