tcp_memcontrol: Cleanup/fix cg_proto->memory_pressure handling.

kill memcg_tcp_enter_memory_pressure.  The only function of
memcg_tcp_enter_memory_pressure was to reduce deal with the
unnecessary abstraction that was tcp_memcontrol.  Now that struct
tcp_memcontrol is gone remove this unnecessary function, the
unnecessary function pointer, and modify sk_enter_memory_pressure to
set this field directly, just as sk_leave_memory_pressure cleas this
field directly.

This fixes a small bug I intruduced when killing struct tcp_memcontrol
that caused memcg_tcp_enter_memory_pressure to never be called and
thus failed to ever set cg_proto->memory_pressure.

Remove the cg_proto enter_memory_pressure function as it now serves
no useful purpose.

Don't test cg_proto->memory_presser in sk_leave_memory_pressure before
clearing it.  The test was originally there to ensure that the pointer
was non-NULL.  Now that cg_proto is not a pointer the pointer does not
matter.
