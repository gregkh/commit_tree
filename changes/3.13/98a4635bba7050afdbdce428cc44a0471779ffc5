mwifiex: fix potential mem leak in .del_virtual_intf

1) Currently we freeing wdev for each interface in driver unload
path. We may leak memory if user have already deleted an interface.
mwifiex_add_virtual_intf() allocates wdev structure. So it should
be freed in mwifiex_del_virtual_intf().
This will make sure that wdev will be freed when user deletes an
interface and also in unload path.
2) "priv->netdev->ieee80211_ptr" should also be cleared in
mwifiex_del_virtual_intf.
