tipc: correct return value of link_cmd_set_value routine

link_cmd_set_value() takes commands for link, bearer and media related
configuration. Genereally the function returns 0 when a command is
recognized, and -EINVAL when it is not. However, in the switch for link
related commands it returns 0 even when the command is unrecognized. This
will sometimes make it look as if a failed configuration command has been
successful, but has otherwise no negative effects.

We remove this anomaly by returning -EINVAL even for link commands. We also
rework all three switches to make them  conforming to common kernel coding
style.
