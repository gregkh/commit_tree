net: avoid reference counter overflows on fib_rules in multicast forwarding

Bob Falken reported that after 4G packets, multicast forwarding stopped
working. This was because of a rule reference counter overflow which
freed the rule as soon as the overflow happend.

This patch solves this by adding the FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF flag to
fib_rules_lookup calls. This is safe even from non-rcu locked sections
as in this case the flag only implies not taking a reference to the rule,
which we don't need at all.

Rules only hold references to the namespace, which are guaranteed to be
available during the call of the non-rcu protected function reg_vif_xmit
because of the interface reference which itself holds a reference to
the net namespace.
