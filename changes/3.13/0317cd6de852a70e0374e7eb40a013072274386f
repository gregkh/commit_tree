rsxx: Kernel Panic caused by mapping Discards

This fixes a kernel panic injected by commit id
8d26750143341831bc312f61c5ed141eeb75b8d0 where discards
are getting mapped through the pci_map_page function call.

The driver will now start verifying that a dma is not a
discard before issuing a the pci_map_page function call.

Also, we are updating the driver version.
