s390/dis: rename structures for unique types

Rename 'insn' and 'operand' structures to more canonical names
to avoid conflicts.

struct insn represents information about an instruction, including
the mnemonics, format and opcode.

struct operand represents the 'properties' and information on howto
interpret the operand value and doesn't contain the value.

We rename these structures for avoiding a global conflict.

i.e,

1,$s/struct insn/struct s390_insn/g
1,$s/struct operand/struct s390_operand/g
