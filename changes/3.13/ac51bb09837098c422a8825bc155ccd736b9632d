drm/nouveau/core: Allow asymmetric nouveau_event_get/_put

Most nouveau event handlers have storage in 'static' containers
(structures with lifetimes nearly equivalent to the drm_device),
but are dangerously reused via nouveau_event_get/_put. For
example, if nouveau_event_get is called more than once for a
given handler, the event handler list will be corrupted.
