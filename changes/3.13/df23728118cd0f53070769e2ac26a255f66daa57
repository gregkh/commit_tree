[media] videobuf2-dma-sg: Allocate pages as contiguous as possible

Most DMA engines have limitations regarding the number of DMA segments
(sg-buffers) that they can handle. Videobuffers can easily spread
through hundreds of pages.
In the previous aproach, the pages were allocated individually, this
could led to the creation houndreds of dma segments (sg-buffers) that
could not be handled by some DMA engines.
This patch tries to minimize the number of DMA segments by using
alloc_pages. In the worst case it will behave as before, but most
of the times it will reduce the number of dma segments
