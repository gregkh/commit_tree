ACPICA: Update aclinux.h for new OSL override mechanism.

The new ACPICA OSL override mechanism is used to solve these issues
for the Linux OSL:
 1. Linux can implement OSL using a macro.
 2. Linux can implement OSL using an inlined function.
 3. Linux can leave OSL not implemented for __KERNEL__ undefined code
    fragments.
 4. Linux can add sparse declarators (__iomem) to OSL.
 5. Linux can add memory tuning declarators (__init/__exit) to OSL.
This patch also moves Linux specific OSL to aclinux.h which has not been
maintained in the ACPICA code base.  Lv Zheng.

Known issue:

 From ACPICA's perspective, actypes.h should be included after inclusion
 of acenv.h.  But currently in Linux, aclinux.h included by acenv.h has
 included actypes.h to find ACPICA types for inline functions.  This is a
 known and existing issue and currently there is no real problem caused
 by this issue for Linux kernel build.  Thus this issue is not covered by
 this cleanup commit.
