ACPICA: Fix indentation issues for macro invocations.

During the automatic translation of the upstream ACPICA source code
into Linux kernel source code some extra white spaces are added by
the "indent" program at the beginning of each line which is an
invocation of a macro and there is no ";" at the end of the line.

For this reason, a new mode has been added to the translation scripts
to remove the extra spaces inserted before invoking such macros and add
an empty line between the invocations of such macros (like the other
function declarations).  This new mode is executed after executing
"indent" during the Linux release process.  Consequently, some
existing ACPICA source code in the Linux kernel tree needs to be
adjusted to allow the new scripts to work correctly.

The affected macros and files are:
 1. ACPI_HW_DEPENDENT_RETURN (acpixf.h/acdebug.h/acevents.h):
    This macro is used as a wrapper for hardware dependent APIs to offer
    a stub when the reduced hardware is configured during compilation.
 2. ACPI_EXPORT_SYMBOL (utglobal.c):
    This macro is used by Linux to export symbols to be found by Linux
    modules.  All such invocations are well formatted except those
    exported as global variables.

This can help to reduce the source code differences between Linux
and upstream ACPICA, and also help to automate the release process.
No functional or binary generation changes should result from it.
