bcache: Refactor journalling flow control

Making things less asynchronous that don't need to be - bch_journal()
only has to block when the journal or journal entry is full, which is
emphatically not a fast path. So make it a normal function that just
returns when it finishes, to make the code and control flow easier to
follow.
