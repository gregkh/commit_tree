perf evlist: Round mmap pages to power 2 - v2

Currently perf requires the -m / --mmap_pages option to be a power of 2.

To be more user friendly perf should automatically round this up to the
next power of 2.

Currently:
  $ perf record -m 3 -a -- sleep 1
  --mmap_pages/-m value must be a power of two.sleep: Terminated

With patch:
  $ perf record -m 3 -a -- sleep 1
  rounding mmap pages size to 16384 (4 pages)
  ...

v2: Add bytes units to rounding message per Ingo's request. Other
    suggestions (e.g., prefixing INFO) should be addressed by wrapping
    pr_info to catch all instances.
