Bluetooth: Add address type to device blacklist table

The device blacklist is not taking care of the address type. Actually
store the address type in the list entries and also use them when
looking up addresses in the table.

This is actually a serious bug. When adding a LE public address to
the blacklist, then it would be blocking a device on BR/EDR. And this
is not the expected behavior.
