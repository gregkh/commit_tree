NTB: Fix ntb_transport link down race

A WARN_ON is being hit in ntb_qp_link_work due to the NTB transport link
being down while the ntb qp link is still active.  This is caused by the
transport link being brought down prior to the qp link worker thread
being terminated.  To correct this, shutdown the qp's prior to bringing
the transport link down.  Also, only call the qp worker thread if it is
in interrupt context, otherwise call the function directly.
