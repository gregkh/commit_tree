ath: fix dynamic user regulatory settings

A world regulatory domain check was in place that
prevents user dynamic regulatory hints from being
processed. This was there for historical reasons
as this was only possible previously for world
roaming cards and dynamic regulatory settings was
only possible for country IEs. Fix this by enforcing
the world regulatory domain check only for when the
initiator is a country IE. Support for dynamic user
regulatory support is already checked.
