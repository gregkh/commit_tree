tools lib traceevent: Add direct access to dynamic arrays

Jiri Olsa was writing a plugin for the cfg80211_tx_mlme_mgmt trace
event, and was not able to get the implemented function working.
The event's print fmt looks like:

   "netdev:%s(%d), ftype:0x%.2x", REC->name, REC->ifindex,
            __le16_to_cpup((__le16 *)__get_dynamic_array(frame))

As there's no helper function for __le16_to_cpup(), Jiri was creating one
with a plugin. But unfortunately, it would not work even though he set
up the plugin correctly.

The problem is that the function parameters do not handle the helper
function "__get_dynamic_array()", and that passes in a NULL pointer.

Adding PRINT_DYNAMIC_ARRAY direct support to eval_num_arg() allows the
use of __get_dynamic_array() in function parameters.
