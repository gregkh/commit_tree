checkpatch: extend CamelCase types and ignore existing CamelCase uses in a patch

Extend the CamelCase words found to include structure members.

In https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/3/318 Sarah Sharp (mostly) wrote:

"In general, if checkpatch.pl complains about a variable a patch
introduces that's CamelCase, you should pay attention to it.  Otherwise,
[] ignore it."

So, if checking a patch, scan the original patched file if it's available
and add any preexisting CamelCase types so reuses do not generate
CamelCase messages.

That also means Andrew's not so cruelly spurned anymore.
