sched: Remove unnecessary iteration over sched domains to update nr_busy_cpus

nr_busy_cpus parameter is used by nohz_kick_needed() to find out the
number of busy cpus in a sched domain which has SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES
flag set.  Therefore instead of updating nr_busy_cpus at every level
of sched domain, since it is irrelevant, we can update this parameter
only at the parent domain of the sd which has this flag set. Introduce
a per-cpu parameter sd_busy which represents this parent domain.

In nohz_kick_needed() we directly query the nr_busy_cpus parameter
associated with the groups of sd_busy.

By associating sd_busy with the highest domain which has
SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES flag set, we cover all lower level domains
which could have this flag set and trigger nohz_idle_balancing if any
of the levels have more than one busy cpu.

sd_busy is irrelevant for asymmetric load balancing. However sd_asym
has been introduced to represent the highest sched domain which has
SD_ASYM_PACKING flag set so that it can be queried directly when
required.

While we are at it, we might as well change the nohz_idle parameter to
be updated at the sd_busy domain level alone and not the base domain
level of a CPU.  This will unify the concept of busy cpus at just one
level of sched domain where it is currently used.
