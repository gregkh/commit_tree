devpts: plug the memory leak in kill_sb

When devpts is unmounted, there may be a no-longer-used IDR tree hanging
off the superblock we are about to kill.  This needs to be cleaned up
before destroying the SB.

The leak is usually not a big deal because unmounting devpts is typically
done when shutting down the whole machine.  However, shutting down an LXC
container instead of a physical machine exposes the problem (the garbage
is detectable with kmemleak).
