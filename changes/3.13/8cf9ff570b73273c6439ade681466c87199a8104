staging: ft1000: status variables changed to int in ft1000_download.c

Linux uses a return type of int for status codes. The file
ft1000_download.c uses a mixture of u16 and u32. This patch changes all
variables called status or Status to ints, whether they are returned
from the function or not. It also changes the return type of all
functions returning one of the variables to correspond. Also, the
declaration of scram_dnldr has been changed in ft1000_usb.h.
