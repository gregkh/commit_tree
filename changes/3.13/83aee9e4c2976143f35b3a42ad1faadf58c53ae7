xfs: simplify the fallocate path

Call xfs_alloc_file_space or xfs_free_file_space directly from
xfs_file_fallocate instead of going through xfs_change_file_space.

This simplified the code by removing the unessecary marshalling of the
arguments into an xfs_flock64_t structure and allows removing checks that
are already done in the VFS code.
