ath9k: Fix interrupt handling for the AR9002 family

This patch adds a driver workaround for a HW issue.

A race condition in the HW results in missing interrupts,
which can be avoided by a read/write with the ISR register.
All chips in the AR9002 series are affected by this bug - AR9003
and above do not have this problem.
