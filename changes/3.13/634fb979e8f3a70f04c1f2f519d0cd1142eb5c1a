inet: includes a sock_common in request_sock

TCP listener refactoring, part 5 :

We want to be able to insert request sockets (SYN_RECV) into main
ehash table instead of the per listener hash table to allow RCU
lookups and remove listener lock contention.

This patch includes the needed struct sock_common in front
of struct request_sock

This means there is no more inet6_request_sock IPv6 specific
structure.

Following inet_request_sock fields were renamed as they became
macros to reference fields from struct sock_common.
Prefix ir_ was chosen to avoid name collisions.

loc_port   -> ir_loc_port
loc_addr   -> ir_loc_addr
rmt_addr   -> ir_rmt_addr
rmt_port   -> ir_rmt_port
iif        -> ir_iif
