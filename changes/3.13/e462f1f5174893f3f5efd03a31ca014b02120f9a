ARM: davinci: fix number of resources passed to davinci_gpio_register()

The davinci_gpio_register() function expects the number of
resources as the second parameter, but sizeof() resources
was passed to it due to which it was causing unexpected
behaviour. This patch fixes the same by passing the
ARRAY_SIZE() of resources.
