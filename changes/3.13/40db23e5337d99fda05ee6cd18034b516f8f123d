random: make add_timer_randomness() fill the nonblocking pool first

Change add_timer_randomness() so that it directs incoming entropy to
the nonblocking pool first if it hasn't been fully initialized yet.
This matches the strategy we use in add_interrupt_randomness(), which
allows us to push the randomness where we need it the most during when
the system is first booting up, so that get_random_bytes() and
/dev/urandom become safe to use as soon as possible.
