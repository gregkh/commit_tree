qlcnic: Do not read QLCNIC_FW_CAPABILITY_MORE_CAPS bit for 83xx adapter

Only 82xx adapter advertises QLCNIC_FW_CAPABILITY_MORE_CAPS bit.
Reading this bit from 83xx adapter causes the driver to skip
extra capabilities registers.

Because of this, driver was not issuing qlcnic_fw_cmd_set_drv_version()
for 83xx adapter.

This bug was introduced in commit 8af3f33db05c6d0146ad14905145a5c923770856
 ("qlcnic: Add support for 'set driver version' in 83XX").
