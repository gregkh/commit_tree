sysfs: add sysfs_open_file->sd and ->file

sysfs will be converted to use seq_file for read path, which will make
it difficult to pass around multiple pointers directly.  This patch
adds sysfs_open_file->sd and ->file so that we can reach all the
necessary data structures from sysfs_open_file.

flush_write_buffer() is updated to drop @dentry which was used to
discover the sysfs_dirent as it's now available through
sysfs_open_file->sd.

This patch doesn't cause any behavior difference.
