powerpc: Support endian agnostic MMIO

This patch maps the MMIO functions for 32bit PowerPC to their
appropriate instructions depending on CPU endianness.

The macros used to create the corresponding inline functions are also
renamed by this patch. Previously they had BE or LE in their names which
was misleading - they had nothing to do with endianness, but actually
created different instruction forms so their new names reflect the
instruction form they are creating (D-Form and X-Form).

Little endian 64bit PowerPC is not supported, so the lack of mappings
(and corresponding breakage) for that case is intentional to bring the
attention of anyone doing a 64bit little endian port. 64bit big endian
is unaffected.
