i40e: Drop unused completed stat

The Tx "completed" stat was part of the original rewrite for detecting
Tx hangs.  However some time ago in ixgbe I determined that we could
just use the packets stat instead.  Since then this stat was
removed from ixgbe and it serves no purpose in i40e so it can be
dropped.
