locking/lockdep: Mark __lockdep_count_forward_deps() as static

There are new Sparse warnings:

  >> kernel/locking/lockdep.c:1235:15: sparse: symbol '__lockdep_count_forward_deps' was not declared. Should it be static?
  >> kernel/locking/lockdep.c:1261:15: sparse: symbol '__lockdep_count_backward_deps' was not declared. Should it be static?

Please consider folding the attached diff :-)
