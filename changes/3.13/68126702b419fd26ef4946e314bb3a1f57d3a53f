slab: overloading the RCU head over the LRU for RCU free

With build-time size checking, we can overload the RCU head over the LRU
of struct page to free pages of a slab in rcu context. This really help to
implement to overload the struct slab over the struct page and this
eventually reduce memory usage and cache footprint of the SLAB.
