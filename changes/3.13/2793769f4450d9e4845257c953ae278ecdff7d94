ALSA: hda - Enable mute/mic-mute LEDs for more Thinkpads with Realtek codec

We're using the ACPI interface to detect whether we're dealing with a Thinkpad
or not. This way we're not loading the thinkpad_acpi module when we're not on
a Thinkpad, but at the same time, we give the opportunity to check for, and
potentially enable, both present and future Thinkpad with mute/micmute LEDs.

At least those running the ALC269 family (269 to 299) of Realtek codecs.
