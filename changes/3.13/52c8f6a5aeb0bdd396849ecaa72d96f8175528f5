mm: get rid of unnecessary overhead of trace_mm_page_alloc_extfrag()

In general, every tracepoint should be zero overhead if it is disabled.
However, trace_mm_page_alloc_extfrag() is one of exception.  It evaluate
"new_type == start_migratetype" even if tracepoint is disabled.

However, the code can be moved into tracepoint's TP_fast_assign() and
TP_fast_assign exist exactly such purpose.  This patch does it.
