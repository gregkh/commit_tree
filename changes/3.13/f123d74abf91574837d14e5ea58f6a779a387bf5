mm: Only flush TLBs if a transhuge PMD is modified for NUMA pte scanning

NUMA PTE scanning is expensive both in terms of the scanning itself and
the TLB flush if there are any updates. The TLB flush is avoided if no
PTEs are updated but there is a bug where transhuge PMDs are considered
to be updated even if they were already pmd_numa. This patch addresses
the problem and TLB flushes should be reduced.
