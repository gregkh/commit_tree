ipv4: fix tunneled VM traffic over hw VXLAN/GRE GSO NIC

VM to VM GSO traffic is broken if it goes through VXLAN or GRE
tunnel and the physical NIC on the host supports hardware VXLAN/GRE
GSO offload (e.g. bnx2x and next-gen mlx4).

Two issues -
(VXLAN) VM traffic has SKB_GSO_DODGY and SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL with
SKB_GSO_TCP/UDP set depending on the inner protocol. GSO header
integrity check fails in udp4_ufo_fragment if inner protocol is
TCP. Also gso_segs is calculated incorrectly using skb->len that
includes tunnel header. Fix: robust check should only be applied
to the inner packet.

(VXLAN & GRE) Once GSO header integrity check passes, NULL segs
is returned and the original skb is sent to hardware. However the
tunnel header is already pulled. Fix: tunnel header needs to be
restored so that hardware can perform GSO properly on the original
packet.
