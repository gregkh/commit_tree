ima: pass the filename argument up to ima_add_template_entry()

Pass the filename argument to ima_add_template_entry() in order to
eliminate a dependency on template specific data (third argument of
integrity_audit_msg).

This change is required because, with the new template management
mechanism, the generation of a new measurement entry will be performed
by new specific functions (introduced in next patches) and the current IMA
code will not be aware anymore of how data is stored in the entry payload.
