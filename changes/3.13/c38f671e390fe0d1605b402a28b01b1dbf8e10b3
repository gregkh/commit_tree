ACPICA: Tests: Add CHECKSUM_ABORT protection for test utilities.

This patch adds protection around ACPI_CHECKSUM_ABORT so that ACPI
user space test utilities can re-define it for their own purposes
(currently used by ASLTS build environment).

This patch doesn't affect Linux kernel behavior.  Lv Zheng.
