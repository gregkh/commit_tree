drm/i915: scramble reset support for DP port CRC on g4x

We need to reset the DP scrambler on every vsync to get stable CRCs.
And since we can't use the normal pipe CRC on DP ports on g4x we
really need them to be able to test modesetting issues on (e)DP
outputs.

Note that the DC balance reset is for SDVO port CRCs so we don't
strictly need it. But better safe than sorry (and it's a nice template
in case we ever want to grab port CRCs for e.g. audio checking).

v2: Apply the suggestions from Damien's review.
