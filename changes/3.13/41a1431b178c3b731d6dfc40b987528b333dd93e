sched/wait: Introduce ___wait_event()

There's far too much duplication in the __wait_event macros; in order
to fix this introduce ___wait_event() a macro with the capability to
replace most other macros.

With the previous patches changing the various __wait_event*()
implementations to be more uniform; we can now collapse the lot
without also changing generated code.
