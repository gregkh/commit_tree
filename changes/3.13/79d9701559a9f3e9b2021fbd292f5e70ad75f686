of/irq: create interrupts-extended property

The standard interrupts property in device tree can only handle
interrupts coming from a single interrupt parent. If a device is wired
to multiple interrupt controllers, then it needs to be attached to a
node with an interrupt-map property to demux the interrupt specifiers
which is confusing. It would be a lot easier if there was a form of the
interrupts property that allows for a separate interrupt phandle for
each interrupt specifier.

This patch does exactly that by creating a new interrupts-extended
property which reuses the phandle+arguments pattern used by GPIOs and
other core bindings.
