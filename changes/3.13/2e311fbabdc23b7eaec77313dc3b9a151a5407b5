[SCSI] hpsa: do not discard scsi status on aborted commands

We inadvertantly discarded the scsi status for aborted commands.
For some commands (e.g. reads from tape drives) these can't be retried,
and if we discarded the scsi status, the scsi mid layer couldn't notice
anything was wrong and the error was not reported.
