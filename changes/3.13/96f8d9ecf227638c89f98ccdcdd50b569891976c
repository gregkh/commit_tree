tuntap: limit head length of skb allocated

We currently use hdr_len as a hint of head length which is advertised by
guest. But when guest advertise a very big value, it can lead to an 64K+
allocating of kmalloc() which has a very high possibility of failure when host
memory is fragmented or under heavy stress. The huge hdr_len also reduce the
effect of zerocopy or even disable if a gso skb is linearized in guest.

To solves those issues, this patch introduces an upper limit (PAGE_SIZE) of the
head, which guarantees an order 0 allocation each time.
