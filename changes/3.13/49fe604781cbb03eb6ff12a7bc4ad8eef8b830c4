sysfs: prepare open path for unified regular / bin file handling

sysfs bin file handling will be merged into the regular file support.
This patch prepares the open path.

This patch updates sysfs_open_file() such that it can handle both
regular and bin files.

This is a preparation and the new bin file path isn't used yet.
