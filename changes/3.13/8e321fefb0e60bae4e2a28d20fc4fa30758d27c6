aio/migratepages: make aio migrate pages sane

The arbitrary restriction on page counts offered by the core
migrate_page_move_mapping() code results in rather suspicious looking
fiddling with page reference counts in the aio_migratepage() operation.
To fix this, make migrate_page_move_mapping() take an extra_count parameter
that allows aio to tell the code about its own reference count on the page
being migrated.

While cleaning up aio_migratepage(), make it validate that the old page
being passed in is actually what aio_migratepage() expects to prevent
misbehaviour in the case of races.
