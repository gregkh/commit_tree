uprobes: Export write_opcode() as uprobe_write_opcode()

set_swbp() and set_orig_insn() are __weak, but this is pointless
because write_opcode() is static.

Export write_opcode() as uprobe_write_opcode() for the upcoming
arm port, this way it can actually override set_swbp() and use
__opcode_to_mem_arm(bpinsn) instead if UPROBE_SWBP_INSN.
