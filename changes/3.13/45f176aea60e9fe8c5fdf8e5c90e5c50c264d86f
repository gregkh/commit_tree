i2c: i2c-dev: Create 'name' attribute automatically

The 'name' attribute is needed for all i2c-dev class devices, meaning
it can be created automatically by pointing to it in the class data
structure. This simplifies the code and reduces the probability for race
conditions (the name attribute should exist by the time the device is
announced to user space).
