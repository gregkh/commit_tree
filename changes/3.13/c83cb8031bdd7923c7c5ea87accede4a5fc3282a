wlcore/wl18xx/wl12xx: FW log params per chip arch

FW memory block size and FW log end marker parameters
are added to wl structure and are initialized per
chip architecture.

convert_hwaddr hw operation is added to convert chip
dependent FW internal address.

Copy from FW log is also simplified to copy the entire
memory block as FW logger utility is repsponsible
for parsing of FW log content.
