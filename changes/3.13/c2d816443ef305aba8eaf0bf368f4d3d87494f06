sched/wait: Introduce prepare_to_wait_event()

Add the new helper, prepare_to_wait_event() which should only be used
by ___wait_event().

prepare_to_wait_event() returns -ERESTARTSYS if signal_pending_state()
is true, otherwise it does prepare_to_wait/exclusive.  This allows to
uninline the signal-pending checks in wait_event*() macros.

Also, it can initialize wait->private/func. We do not care if they were
already initialized, the values are the same. This also shaves a couple
of insns from the inlined code.

This obviously makes prepare_*() path a little bit slower, but we are
likely going to sleep anyway, so I think it makes sense to shrink .text:

               text    data      bss      dec     hex  filename

    after:  5124618 2955152 10117120 18196890 115a99a   vmlinux

on my build.
