misc: mic: depend on X86 for both host and card drivers.

This fixes build failures seen on certain non X86 architectures.
The card driver should correctly always depend on X86. The host
driver can potentially work on non X86 architectures although
it has never been built or validated in such configurations.
The host driver dependency on X86 can be removed at some point
in the future but this workaround is required for now.
