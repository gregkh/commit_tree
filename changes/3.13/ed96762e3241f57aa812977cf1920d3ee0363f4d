ARM: bL_switcher: do not hardcode GIC IDs in the code

Currently, GIC IDs are hardcoded making the code dependent on the 4+4 b.L
configuration.  Let's allow for GIC IDs to be discovered upon switcher
initialization to support other b.L configurations such as the 1+1 one,
or 2+3 as on the VExpress TC2.
