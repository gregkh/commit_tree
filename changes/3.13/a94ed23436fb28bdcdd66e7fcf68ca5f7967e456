ASoC: Remove 'reg_size' field from snd_soc_codec struct

The reg_size field is calculated in snd_soc_register_codec() and then used
exactly once in snd_soc_flat_cache_init(). Since it is calculated based on other
fields from the codec struct just move the calculation to
snd_soc_flat_cache_init() and remove the 'reg_size' field from the codec struct.
