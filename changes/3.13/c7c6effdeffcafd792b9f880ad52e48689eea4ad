netconsole: fix multiple race conditions

In every netconsole option that can be set through configfs there's a
race when checking for nt->enabled since it can be modified at the same
time. Probably the most damage can be done by store_enabled when racing
with another instance of itself. Fix all the races with one stone by
moving the mutex lock around the ->store call for all options.
