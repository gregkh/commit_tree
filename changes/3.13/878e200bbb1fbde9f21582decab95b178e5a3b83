mmc: core: Do not poll for busy with status cmd for all switch cmds

Some switch operations like poweroff notify, shall according to the
spec not be followed by any other new commands. For these cases and
when the host does'nt support MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY, we must not
send status commands to poll for busy detection. Instead wait for
the stated timeout from the EXT_CSD before completing the request.
