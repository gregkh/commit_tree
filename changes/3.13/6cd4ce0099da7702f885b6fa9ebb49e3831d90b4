virtio-net: fix refill races during restore

During restoring, try_fill_recv() was called with neither napi lock nor napi
disabled. This can lead two try_fill_recv() was called in the same time. Fix
this by refilling before trying to enable napi.

Fixes 0741bcb5584f9e2390ae6261573c4de8314999f2
(virtio: net: Add freeze, restore handlers to support S4).
