ALSA: hda - Check keep_eapd_on before inv_eapd

We don't change the EAPD bit in set_pin_eapd() if keep_eapd_on flag is
set by the codec driver and enable is false.  But, we also apply the
flipping of enable value according to inv_eapd flag in the same
function, and this confused the former check, handled as if it's
turned ON.  The inverted EAPD check must be applied after keep_eapd_on
check, instead.
