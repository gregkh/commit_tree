powerpc: Fix Unaligned Loads and Stores

This patch modifies the unaligned access routines of the sstep.c
module so that it properly reverses the bytes of storage operands
in the little endian kernel kernel.   This is implemented by
breaking an unaligned little endian access into a combination of
single byte accesses plus an overal byte reversal operation.
