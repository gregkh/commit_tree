x86: Improve the printout of the SMP bootup CPU table

As the new x86 CPU bootup printout format code maintainer, I am
taking immediate action to improve and clean (and thus indulge
my OCD) the reporting of the cores when coming up online.

Fix padding to a right-hand alignment, cleanup code and bind
reporting width to the max number of supported CPUs on the
system, like this:

 [    0.074509] smpboot: Booting Node   0, Processors:      #1  #2  #3  #4  #5  #6  #7 OK
 [    0.644008] smpboot: Booting Node   1, Processors:  #8  #9 #10 #11 #12 #13 #14 #15 OK
 [    1.245006] smpboot: Booting Node   2, Processors: #16 #17 #18 #19 #20 #21 #22 #23 OK
 [    1.864005] smpboot: Booting Node   3, Processors: #24 #25 #26 #27 #28 #29 #30 #31 OK
 [    2.489005] smpboot: Booting Node   4, Processors: #32 #33 #34 #35 #36 #37 #38 #39 OK
 [    3.093005] smpboot: Booting Node   5, Processors: #40 #41 #42 #43 #44 #45 #46 #47 OK
 [    3.698005] smpboot: Booting Node   6, Processors: #48 #49 #50 #51 #52 #53 #54 #55 OK
 [    4.304005] smpboot: Booting Node   7, Processors: #56 #57 #58 #59 #60 #61 #62 #63 OK
 [    4.961413] Brought up 64 CPUs

and this:

 [    0.072367] smpboot: Booting Node   0, Processors:    #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 OK
 [    0.686329] Brought up 8 CPUs
