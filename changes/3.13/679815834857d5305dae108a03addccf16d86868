tipc: correct return value of recv_msg routine

Currently, rcv_msg() always returns zero on a packet delivery upcall
from net_device.

To make its behavior more compliant with the way this API should be
used, we change this to let it return NET_RX_SUCCESS (which is zero
anyway) when it is able to handle the packet, and NET_RX_DROP otherwise.
The latter does not imply any functional change, it only enables the
driver to keep more accurate statistics about the fate of delivered
packets.
