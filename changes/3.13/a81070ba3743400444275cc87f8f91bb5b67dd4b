Bluetooth: Fix updating settings when there are no HCI commands to send

It is possible that the Set Connectable management command doesn't cause
any HCI commands to send (such as when BR/EDR is disabled). We can't
just send a response to user space in this case but must also update the
necessary device flags and settings. This patch fixes the issue by using
the recently introduced set_connectable_update_settings function.
