mmc: dw_mmc: fix the transfer termination in IDMAC mode

In IDMAC mode EVENT_XFER_COMPLETE is set when RI/TI of last descriptor
is done. So if errors are happened in the middle of data transfers,
'dw_mci_stop_dma' during error handing can be called and eventually
prevents this flag to be set.  This results in permanent wait for
EVENT_XFER_COMPLETE in 'dw_mci_tasklet_func'.  Therefore, if dma
running is stopped forcibly, EVENT_XFER_COMPLETE should be set.
