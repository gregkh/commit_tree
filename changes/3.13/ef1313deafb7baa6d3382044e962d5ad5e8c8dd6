powerpc: Add VMX optimised xor for RAID5

Add a VMX optimised xor, used primarily for RAID5. On a POWER7 blade
this is a decent win:

   32regs    : 17932.800 MB/sec
   altivec   : 19724.800 MB/sec

The bigger gain is when the same test is run in SMT4 mode, as it
would if there was a lot of work going on:

   8regs     :  8377.600 MB/sec
   altivec   : 15801.600 MB/sec

I tested this against an array created without the patch, and also
verified it worked as expected on a little endian kernel.
