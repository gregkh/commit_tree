md/raid10: fix bug when raid10 recovery fails to recover a block.

commit e875ecea266a543e643b19e44cf472f1412708f9
    md/raid10 record bad blocks as needed during recovery.

added code to the "cannot recover this block" path to record a bad
block rather than fail the whole recovery.
Unfortunately this new case was placed *after* r10bio was freed rather
than *before*, yet it still uses r10bio.
This is will crash with a null dereference.

So move the freeing of r10bio down where it is safe.
