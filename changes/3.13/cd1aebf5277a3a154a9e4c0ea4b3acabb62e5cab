arm64: reorganise smp_enable_ops

For hotplug support, we're going to want a place to store operations
that do more than bring CPUs online, and it makes sense to group these
with our current smp_enable_ops. For cpuidle support, we'll want to
group additional functions, and we may want them even for UP kernels.

This patch renames smp_enable_ops to the more general cpu_operations,
and pulls the definitions out of smp code such that they can be used in
UP kernels. While we're at it, fix up instances of the cpu parameter to
be an unsigned int, drop the init markings and rename the *_cpu
functions to cpu_* to reduce future churn when cpu_operations is
extended.
