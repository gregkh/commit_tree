ioat: kill msix_single_vector support

Once we have determined that we will not have all of our desired msix
vectors there is no point in attempting a single msix allocation.  The
driver will already need to read registers to determine the source of
the interrupt the fact that it is msix is moot.  Fallback directly to
msi.
