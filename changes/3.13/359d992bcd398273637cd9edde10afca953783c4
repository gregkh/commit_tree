xfs: simplify kmem_{zone_}zalloc

Introduce flag KM_ZERO which is used to alloc zeroed entry, and convert
kmem_{zone_}zalloc to call kmem_{zone_}alloc() with KM_ZERO directly,
in order to avoid the setting to zero step. 
And following Dave's suggestion, make kmem_{zone_}zalloc static inline
into kmem.h as they're now just a simple wrapper.

V2:
  Make kmem_{zone_}zalloc static inline into kmem.h as Dave suggested.
