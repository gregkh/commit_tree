mfd/rtc: s5m: fix register updating by adding regmap for RTC

Rename old regmap field of "struct sec_pmic_dev" to "regmap_pmic" and
add new regmap for RTC.

On S5M8767A registers were not properly updated and read due to usage of
the same regmap as the PMIC.  This could be observed in various hangs,
e.g.  in infinite loop during waiting for UDR field change.

On this chip family the RTC has different I2C address than PMIC so
additional regmap is needed.
