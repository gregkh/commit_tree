staging: comedi: drivers: use comedi_dio_update_state() for simple cases

Use comedi_dio_update_state() to handle the boilerplate code to update
the subdevice s->state for simple cases where the hardware is updated
when any channel is modified.

Also, fix a bug in the amplc_pc263 and amplc_pci263 drivers where the
current state is not returned in data[1].
