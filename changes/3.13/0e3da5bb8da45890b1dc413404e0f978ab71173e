ip_gre: fix msg_name parsing for recvfrom/recvmsg

ipgre_header_parse() needs to parse the tunnel's ip header and it
uses mac_header to locate the iphdr. This got broken when gre tunneling
was refactored as mac_header is no longer updated to point to iphdr.
Introduce skb_pop_mac_header() helper to do the mac_header assignment
and use it in ipgre_rcv() to fix msg_name parsing.

Bug introduced in commit c54419321455 (GRE: Refactor GRE tunneling code.)
