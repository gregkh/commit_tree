drm/i915/bdw: support GMS and GGMS changes

All the BARs have the ability to grow.

v2: Pulled out the simulator workaround to a separate patch.
Rebased.

v3: Rebase onto latest vlv patches from Jesse.

v4: Rebased on top of the early stolen quirk patch from Jesse.

v5: Use the new macro names.
s/INTEL_BDW_PCI_IDS_D/INTEL_BDW_D_IDS
s/INTEL_BDW_PCI_IDS_M/INTEL_BDW_M_IDS
It's Jesse's fault for not following the convention I originally set.
