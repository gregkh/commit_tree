staging: vt6656: Removed redundant code from iwctl file

There was one line which was added twice in the
definition of iwctl_handler and hence was redundant.
It was defined at line nos 1798 and 1818. Removed
the code at line 1818.
The redundant code was:
IW_HANDLER(SIOCSIWMLME, iwctl_siwmlme)
which was defined twice.
