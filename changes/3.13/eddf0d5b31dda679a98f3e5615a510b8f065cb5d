s390/qdio: fix atomic_sub() misusage

get_inbound_buffer_frontier() makes use of the return value of atomic_sub()
which shouldn't work, since atomic_sub() is supposed to return void.
This only works on s390 because atomic_sub() gets mapped to atomic_sub_return()
with a define without changing it's return value to void.

So use atomic_sub_return() instead of atomic_sub() in qeth code before fixing
atomic ops.
