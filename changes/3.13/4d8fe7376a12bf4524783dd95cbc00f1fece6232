audit: use nlmsg_len() to get message payload length

Using the nlmsg_len member of the netlink header to test if the message
is valid is wrong as it includes the size of the netlink header itself.
Thereby allowing to send short netlink messages that pass those checks.

Use nlmsg_len() instead to test for the right message length. The result
of nlmsg_len() is guaranteed to be non-negative as the netlink message
already passed the checks of nlmsg_ok().

Also switch to min_t() to please checkpatch.pl.
