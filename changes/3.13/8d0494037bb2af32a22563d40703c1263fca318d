i2c: rcar: get clock rate only once and simplify calculation

There is no need to repeatedly query clock frequency, where it is not
expected to change. The complete loop can also trivially be replaced with
a simple division. A further loop below the one, being simplified, could
also be replaced, but that would get more complicated.
