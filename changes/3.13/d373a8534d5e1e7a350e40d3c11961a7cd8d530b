usb: musb: musb_cppi41: factor most of cppi41_dma_callback() into cppi41_trans_done()

This patch moves most of the logic in cppi41_dma_callback() into
cppi41_trans_done() where it can be called from another function.
Instead of computing "transferred" (the number of bytes transferred in
the last transaction) in cppi41_trans_done() the member
"cppi41_channel->prog_len" is now set to 0 if the transfer as a whole
can be considered as done. If it is != 0 then the next iteration is
assumed.
This is a preparation for a workaround.
