usb: phy: omap-usb2: use the new generic PHY framework

Used the generic PHY framework API to create the PHY. Now the power off and
power on are done in omap_usb_power_off and omap_usb_power_on respectively.
The omap-usb2 driver is also moved to driver/phy.

However using the old USB PHY library cannot be completely removed
because OTG is intertwined with PHY and moving to the new framework
will break OTG. Once we have a separate OTG state machine, we
can get rid of the USB PHY library.
