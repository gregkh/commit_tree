ACPI / video: Add Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 to acpi video detect blacklist

On the Yoga 13 the backlight control doesn't work via ACPI. (And doesn't
work either with the low-level platform driver ideapad_laptop; but
works correctly via the intel video driver).  This patch hence adds the
Yoga 13 to the ACPI video detect blacklist, to make sure the broken ACPI
backlight device is never exposed to userspace.

Note that this appears unrelated to the Windows 8 backlight issues tracked
here:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51231
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60682

The Yoga's ACPI backlight controls work neither with nor without
acpi_osi="!Windows 2012" on the kernel command line. It appears that
backlight control via the EC simply is not available at all, regardless
whether done via ACPI or via the vendor driver.
