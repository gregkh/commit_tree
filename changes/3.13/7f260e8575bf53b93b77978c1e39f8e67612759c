SUNRPC: Enable the keepalive option for TCP sockets

For NFSv4 we want to avoid retransmitting RPC calls unless the TCP
connection breaks. However we still want to detect TCP connection
breakage as soon as possible. Do this by setting the keepalive option
with the idle timeout and count set to the 'timeo' and 'retrans' mount
options.
