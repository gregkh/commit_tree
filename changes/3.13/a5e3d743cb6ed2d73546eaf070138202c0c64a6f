[media] vb2: regression fix: always set length field.

Commit dc77523c5da5513df1bbc74db2a522a94f4cec0e ensured that m.offset is
only set for the MMAP memory mode by calling __setup_offsets only for that
mode.

However, __setup_offsets also initializes the length fields, and that should
be done regardless of the memory mode. Because of that change the v4l2-ctl
test application fails for the USERPTR mode.

This fix creates a __setup_lengths function that sets the length, and
__setup_offsets just sets the offset and no longer touches the length.
