arm64: compat: Clear the IT state independent of the 32-bit ARM or Thumb-2 mode

The ARM architecture reference specifies that the IT state bits in the
PSR must be all zeros in ARM mode or behavior is unspecified. If an ARM
function is registered as a signal handler, and that signal is delivered
inside a block of instructions following an IT instruction, some of the
instructions at the beginning of the signal handler may be skipped if
the IT state bits of the Program Status Register are not cleared by the
kernel.
