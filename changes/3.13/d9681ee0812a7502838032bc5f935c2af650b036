usb: dwc3: Remove additional delay of 100ms when resuming

This delay got introduced in:
"7415f17 usb: dwc3: core: add power management support"
which reflected similar code in dwc3_core_soft_reset() function.
However, originally the delay of 100ms in dwc3_core_soft_reset() was
meant to assist USB2PHY and USB3PHY reset, not for usb_phy_init()
sequence.

We should get rid of this delay, since things will still work
fine without this.
