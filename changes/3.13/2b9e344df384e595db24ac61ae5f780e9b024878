perf/x86/intel: Clean up checkpoint-interrupt bits

Clean up the weird CP interrupt exception code by keeping a CP mask.

Andi suggested this implementation but weirdly didn't actually
implement it himself, do so now because it removes the conditional in
the interrupt handler and avoids the assumption its only on cnt2.
