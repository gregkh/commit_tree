ARM: OMAP2+: display: Create omap_vout device inside omap_display_init

Move omap_vout device creation inside the omap_display_init so that we can
correctly create the device based on the presence of omapdss within the
platform.

For example, on a kernel image supporting multiple platforms, omap_init_vout
will create a omapdrm platform device on a AM33xx platform even though it
doesn't have a DSS block.
