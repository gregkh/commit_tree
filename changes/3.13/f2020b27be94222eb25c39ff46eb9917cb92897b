netfilter: ip6t_REJECT: skip checksum verification for outgoing ipv6 packets

Don't verify checksum for outgoing packets because checksum calculation
may be done by the device.

Without this patch:
$ ip6tables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
$ time telnet ipv6.google.com 80
Trying 2a00:1450:4010:c03::67...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out

real    0m7.201s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s

With the patch applied:
$ ip6tables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
$ time telnet ipv6.google.com 80
Trying 2a00:1450:4010:c03::67...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

real    0m0.085s
