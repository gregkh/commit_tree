sched: Revert need_resched() to look at TIF_NEED_RESCHED

Yuanhan reported a serious throughput regression in his pigz
benchmark. Using the ftrace patch I found that several idle
paths need more TLC before we can switch the generic
need_resched() over to preempt_need_resched.

The preemption paths benefit most from preempt_need_resched and
do indeed use it; all other need_resched() users don't really
care that much so reverting need_resched() back to
tif_need_resched() is the simple and safe solution.
