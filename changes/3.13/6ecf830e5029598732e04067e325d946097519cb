ARM: 7880/1: Clear the IT state independent of the Thumb-2 mode

The ARM architecture reference specifies that the IT state bits in the
PSR must be all zeros in ARM mode or behavior is unspecified.  On the
Qualcomm Snapdragon S4/Krait architecture CPUs the processor continues
to consider the IT state bits while in ARM mode.  This makes it so
that some instructions are skipped by the CPU.
