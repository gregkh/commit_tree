rcu: Fix CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL panic on machines with sparse CPU mask

Some architectures have sparse cpu mask. UltraSparc's cpuinfo for example:

CPU0: online
CPU2: online

So, set only possible CPUs when CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL is enabled.

Also, check that user passes right 'rcu_nocbs=' option.
