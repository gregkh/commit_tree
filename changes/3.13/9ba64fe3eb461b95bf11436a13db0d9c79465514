ARM: imx: enable suspend for imx6sl

The imx6sl low power mode implementation inherits imx6q/dl one,
and pm-imx6q.c can just work for imx6sl with some minor updates.
Let's enable imx6sl suspend support by reusing pm-imx6q.c and use
cpu_is_imxXX() to handle the those minor differences between imx6sl
and imx6q/dl.
