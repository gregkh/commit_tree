Query device characteristics at mount time from server on SMB2/3 not just on cifs mounts

Currently SMB2 and SMB3 mounts do not query the device information at mount time
from the server as is done for cifs.  These can be useful for debugging.
This is a minor patch, that extends the previous one (which added ability to
query file system attributes at mount time - this returns the device
characteristics - also via in /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData)
