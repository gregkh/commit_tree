NFSv4: Update list of irrecoverable errors on DELEGRETURN

If the DELEGRETURN errors out with something like NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID
then there is no recovery possible. Just quit without returning an error.

Also, note that the client must not assume that the NFSv4 lease has been
renewed when it sees an error on DELEGRETURN.
