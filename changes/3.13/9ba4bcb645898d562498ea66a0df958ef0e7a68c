initramfs: read CONFIG_RD_ variables for initramfs compression

When expert configuration option(CONFIG_EXPERT) is enabled, menuconfig
offers a choice of compression algorithm to compress initial ramfs image;
This choice is stored into CONFIG_RD_* variables.  But usr/Makefile uses
earlier INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_* macros to build initial ramfs file.  Since
none of them is defined, resulting 'initramfs_data.cpio' file remains
un-compressed.

This patch updates the Makefile to use CONFIG_RD_* variables and adds
support for LZ4 compression algorithm.  Also updates the
'gen_initramfs_list.sh' script to check whether a selected compression
command is accessible or not.  And fall-back to default gzip(1)
compression when it is not.
