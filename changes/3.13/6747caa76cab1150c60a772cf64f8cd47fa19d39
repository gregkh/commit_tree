usb: phy: twl4030: use the new generic PHY framework

Used the generic PHY framework API to create the PHY. For powering on
and powering off the PHY, power_on and power_off ops are used. Once the
MUSB OMAP glue is adapted to the new framework, the suspend and resume
ops of usb phy library will be removed. Also twl4030-usb driver is moved
to drivers/phy/.

However using the old usb phy library cannot be completely removed
because otg is intertwined with phy and moving to the new
framework completely will break otg. Once we have a separate otg state machine,
we can get rid of the usb phy library.
