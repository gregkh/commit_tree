sched/numa: Do not trap hinting faults for shared libraries

NUMA hinting faults will not migrate a shared executable page mapped by
multiple processes on the grounds that the data is probably in the CPU
cache already and the page may just bounce between tasks running on multipl
nodes. Even if the migration is avoided, there is still the overhead of
trapping the fault, updating the statistics, making scheduler placement
decisions based on the information etc. If we are never going to migrate
the page, it is overhead for no gain and worse a process may be placed on
a sub-optimal node for shared executable pages. This patch avoids trapping
faults for shared libraries entirely.
