Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-ep93xx suspend"

This reverts commit 018258b4360b99b41c50ece917111f138e2314e7.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
