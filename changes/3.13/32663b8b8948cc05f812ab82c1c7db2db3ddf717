ibm emac: Fix locking for enable/disable eob irq

Calls to mal_enable_eob_irq perform a read-write-modify of a dcr to
enable device irqs which is protected by a spin lock. However calls to
mal_disable_eob_irq do not take the corresponding lock.

This patch resolves the problem by ensuring that calls to
mal_disable_eob_irq also take the lock.
