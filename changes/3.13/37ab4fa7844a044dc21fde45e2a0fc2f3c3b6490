net: unix: allow bind to fail on mutex lock

This is similar to the set_peek_off patch where calling bind while the
socket is stuck in unix_dgram_recvmsg() will block and cause a hung task
spew after a while.

This is also the last place that did a straightforward mutex_lock(), so
there shouldn't be any more of these patches.
