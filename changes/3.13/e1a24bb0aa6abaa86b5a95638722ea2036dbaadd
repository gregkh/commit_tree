dcache: Don't set DISCONNECTED on "pseudo filesystem" dentries

I can't for the life of me see any reason why anyone should care whether
a dentry that is never hooked into the dentry cache would need
DCACHE_DISCONNECTED set.

This originates from 4b936885ab04dc6e0bb0ef35e0e23c1a7364d9e5 "fs:
improve scalability of pseudo filesystems", which probably just made the
false assumption the DCACHE_DISCONNECTED was meant to be set on anything
not connected to a parent somehow.

So this is just confusing.  Ideally the only uses of DCACHE_DISCONNECTED
would be in the filehandle-lookup code, which needs it to ensure
dentries are connected into the dentry tree before use.

I left d_alloc_pseudo there even though it's now equivalent to
__d_alloc(), just on the theory the name is better documentation of its
intended use outside dcache.c.
