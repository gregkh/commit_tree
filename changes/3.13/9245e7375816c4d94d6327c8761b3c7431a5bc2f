Bluetooth: Fix sending responses to identified L2CAP response packets

When L2CAP packets return a non-zero error and the value is passed
onwards by l2cap_bredr_sig_cmd this will trigger a command reject packet
to be sent. However, the core specification (page 1416 in core 4.0) says
the following: "Command Reject packets should not be sent in response to
an identified Response packet.".

This patch ensures that a command reject packet is not sent for any
identified response packet by ignoring the error return value from the
response handler functions.
