bcache: Break up struct search

With all the recent refactoring around struct btree op struct search has
gotten rather large.

But we can now easily break it up in a different way - we break out
struct btree_insert_op which is for inserting data into the cache, and
that's now what the copying gc code uses - struct search is now specific
to request.c
