KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Correct errors in H_ENTER implementation

The implementation of H_ENTER in PR KVM has some errors:

* With H_EXACT not set, if the HPTEG is full, we return H_PTEG_FULL
  as the return value of kvmppc_h_pr_enter, but the caller is expecting
  one of the EMULATE_* values.  The H_PTEG_FULL needs to go in the
  guest's R3 instead.

* With H_EXACT set, if the selected HPTE is already valid, the H_ENTER
  call should return a H_PTEG_FULL error.

This fixes these errors and also makes it write only the selected HPTE,
not the whole group, since only the selected HPTE has been modified.
This also micro-optimizes the calculations involving pte_index and i.
