ima: use dynamically allocated hash storage

For each inode in the IMA policy, an iint is allocated.  To support
larger hash digests, the iint digest size changed from 20 bytes to
the maximum supported hash digest size.  Instead of allocating the
maximum size, which most likely is not needed, this patch dynamically
allocates the needed hash storage.

Changelog:
- fix krealloc bug
