bpf: do not use reciprocal divide

At first Jakub Zawadzki noticed that some divisions by reciprocal_divide
were not correct. (off by one in some cases)

He could also show this with BPF:

The reciprocal divide in linux kernel is not generic enough,
lets remove its use in BPF, as it is not worth the pain with
current cpus.
