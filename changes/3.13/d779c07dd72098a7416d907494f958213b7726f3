ARM: bitops: prefetch the destination word for write prior to strex

The cost of changing a cacheline from shared to exclusive state can be
significant, especially when this is triggered by an exclusive store,
since it may result in having to retry the transaction.

This patch prefixes our atomic bitops implementation with prefetchw,
to try and grab the line in exclusive state from the start. The testop
macro is left alone, since the barrier semantics limit the usefulness
of prefetching data.
