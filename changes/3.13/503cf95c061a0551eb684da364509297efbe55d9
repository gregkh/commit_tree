x86, build, icc: Remove uninitialized_var() from compiler-intel.h

When compiling with icc, <linux/compiler-gcc.h> ends up included
because the icc environment defines __GNUC__.  Thus, we neither need
nor want to have this macro defined in both compiler-gcc.h and
compiler-intel.h, and the fact that they are inconsistent just makes
the compiler spew warnings.
