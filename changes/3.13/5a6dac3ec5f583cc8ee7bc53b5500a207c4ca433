mm: numa: do not clear PMD during PTE update scan

If the PMD is flushed then a parallel fault in handle_mm_fault() will
enter the pmd_none and do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page() path where it'll
attempt to insert a huge zero page.  This is wasteful so the patch
avoids clearing the PMD when setting pmd_numa.
