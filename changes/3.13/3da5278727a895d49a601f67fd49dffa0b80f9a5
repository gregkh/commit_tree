of/irq: Rework of_irq_count()

The of_irq_to_resource() helper that is used to implement of_irq_count()
tries to resolve interrupts and in fact creates a mapping for resolved
interrupts. That's pretty heavy lifting for something that claims to
just return the number of interrupts requested by a given device node.

Instead, use the more lightweight of_irq_map_one(), which, despite the
name, doesn't create an actual mapping. Perhaps a better name would be
of_irq_translate_one().
