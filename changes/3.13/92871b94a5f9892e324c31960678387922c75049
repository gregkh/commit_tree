ARM: 7855/1: Add check for Cortex-A15 errata 798181 ECO

The work-around for A15 errata 798181 is not needed if appropriate ECO
fixes have been applied to r3p2 and earlier core revisions. This can be
checked by reading REVIDR register bits 4 and 9. If only bit 4 is set,
then the IPI broadcast can be skipped.
