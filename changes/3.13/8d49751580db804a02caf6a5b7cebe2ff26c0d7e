Sample Implementation of Intel MIC User Space Daemon.

This patch introduces a sample user space daemon which
implements the virtio device backends on the host. The daemon
creates/removes/configures virtio device backends by communicating with
the Intel MIC Host Driver. The virtio devices currently supported are
virtio net, virtio console and virtio block. Virtio net supports TSO/GSO.
The daemon also monitors card shutdown status and takes appropriate actions
like killing the virtio backends and resetting the card upon card shutdown
and crashes.
