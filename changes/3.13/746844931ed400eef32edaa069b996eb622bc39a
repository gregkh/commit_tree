bonding: verify if we still have slaves in bond_3ad_unbind_slave()

After commit 1f718f0f4f97145f4072d2d72dcf85069ca7226d ("bonding: populate
neighbour's private on enslave"), we've moved the unlinking of the slave
to the earliest position possible - so that nobody will see an
half-uninited slave.

However, bond_3ad_unbind_slave() relied that, even while removing the last
slave, it is still accessible - via __get_first_agg() (and, eventually,
bond_first_slave()).

Fix that by verifying if the aggregator return is an actual aggregator, but
not NULL.
