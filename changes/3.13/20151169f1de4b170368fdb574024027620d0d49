powerpc: Make 64-bit non-VMX __copy_tofrom_user bi-endian

The powerpc 64-bit __copy_tofrom_user() function uses shifts to handle
unaligned invocations.  However, these shifts were designed for
big-endian systems: On little-endian systems, they must shift in the
opposite direction.

This commit relies on the C preprocessor to insert the correct shifts
into the assembly code.

[ This is a rare but nasty LE issue. Most of the time we use the POWER7
optimised __copy_tofrom_user_power7 loop, but when it hits an exception
we fall back to the base __copy_tofrom_user loop. - Anton ]
