ipv6: don't install anycast address for /128 addresses on routers

It does not make sense to create an anycast address for an /128-prefix.
Suppress it.

As 32019e651c6fce ("ipv6: Do not leave router anycast address for /127
prefixes.") shows we also may not leave them, because we could accidentally
remove an anycast address the user has allocated or got added via another
prefix.
