rcu: Avoid sparse warnings in rcu_nocb_wake trace event

The event-tracing macros do not like bool tracing arguments, so this
commit makes them be of type char.  This change has the knock-on effect
of making it illegal to pass a pointer into one of these arguments, so
also change rcutiny's first call to trace_rcu_batch_end() to convert
from pointer to boolean, prefixing with "!!".
