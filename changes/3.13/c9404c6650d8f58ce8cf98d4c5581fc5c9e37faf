tools/perf/build: Speed up the final link

libtraceevent.a and liblk.a rules have always-missed dependencies,
which causes python.so to be relinked at every build attempt - even
if none of the affected code changes.

This slows down re-builds unnecessarily, by adding more than a second
to the build time:

  comet:~/tip/tools/perf> time make

  ...

    SUBDIR /fast/mingo/tip/tools/lib/lk/
    make[1]: `liblk.a' is up to date.
    SUBDIR /fast/mingo/tip/tools/lib/traceevent/
    LINK perf
    GEN python/perf.so

  real    0m1.701s
  user    0m1.338s
  sys     0m0.301s

Add the (trivial) dependencies to not force a re-link.

This speeds up an empty re-build enormously:

  comet:~/tip/tools/perf> time make

  ...

  real    0m0.207s
  user    0m0.134s
  sys     0m0.028s

[ This adds some coupling between the build dependencies of
  libtraceevent and liblk - but until those stay relatively
  simple this should not be an issue. ]
