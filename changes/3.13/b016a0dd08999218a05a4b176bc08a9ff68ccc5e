tools/perf/build: Pass through all targets to Makefile.perf

Jiri reported that 'make .o' stopped working:

  > [jolsa@krava perf]$ make -f Makefile perf.o
  > cc    -c -o perf.o perf.c
  > In file included from builtin.h:4:0,
  >                  from perf.c:9:
  > util/util.h:74:24: fatal error: lk/debugfs.h: No such file or directory
  > compilation terminated.
  > make: *** [perf.o] Error 1

This is due to GNU make having built-in rules for popular targets such
as *.o. Clear them out so that all targets as passed through to Makefile.perf.
