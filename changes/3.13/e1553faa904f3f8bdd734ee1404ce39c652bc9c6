drm/i915: Fix VGA_DISP_DISABLE check

The VGACNTRL register contains a bunch of other stuff besides
the VGA_DISP_DISABLE bit. When we write the register we always set those
other bits to zero, so normally the current check would work.

However on HSW disabling and re-enabling the power well will reset the
VGACNTRL register to its default value, which has several of the other
bits set as well.

So only look at the VGA_DISP_DISABLE bit when checking whether the VGA
plane needs re-disabling.
