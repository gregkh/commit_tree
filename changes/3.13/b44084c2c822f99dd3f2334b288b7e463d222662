inet: rename ir_loc_port to ir_num

In commit 634fb979e8f ("inet: includes a sock_common in request_sock")
I forgot that the two ports in sock_common do not have same byte order :

skc_dport is __be16 (network order), but skc_num is __u16 (host order)

So sparse complains because ir_loc_port (mapped into skc_num) is
considered as __u16 while it should be __be16

Let rename ir_loc_port to ireq->ir_num (analogy with inet->inet_num),
and perform appropriate htons/ntohs conversions.
