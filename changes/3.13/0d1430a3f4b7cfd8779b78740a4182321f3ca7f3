drm/i915: Hold mutex across i915_gem_release

Inorder to serialise the closing of the file descriptor and its
subsequent release of client requests with i915_gem_free_request(), we
need to hold the struct_mutex in i915_gem_release(). Failing to do so
has the potential to trigger an OOPS, later with a use-after-free.
