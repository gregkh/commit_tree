ACPICA: Add safe versions of common string functions.

This change adds and deploys "safe" versions of strcpy and strcat that
ensure that the target buffer does not overflow. These safe functions
are only helpful for processing user input and command lines. For most
ACPICA code however, the required buffer length is precisely calculated
before buffer allocation, so the use of these functions is unnecessary.
ACPICA BZ 1043.

This change only applies to the ACPICA utilities and the debugger, none
of which are not shipped with the kernel yet, so the kernel's behavior
remains unchanged after it.
