sched/fair: Avoid integer overflow

sa->runnable_avg_sum is of type u32 but after shifting it by NICE_0_SHIFT
bits it is promoted to u64.  This of course makes no sense, since the
result will never be more then 32-bit long.  Casting sa->runnable_avg_sum
to u64 before it is shifted, fixes this problem.
