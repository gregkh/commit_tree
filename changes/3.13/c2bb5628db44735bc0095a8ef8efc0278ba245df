IPoIB: Fix crash in dev_open error flow

If napi has never been enabled when calling ipoib_ib_dev_stop, a
kernel crash occurs, because the verbs layer completion handler
(ipoib_ib_completion) calls napi_schedule unconditionally.

If the napi structure passed in the napi_schedule call has not
been initialized, napi will crash.

The cleanest solution is to simply enable napi before calling
ipoib_ib_dev_stop in the dev_open error flow. (dev_stop then
immediately disables napi).
