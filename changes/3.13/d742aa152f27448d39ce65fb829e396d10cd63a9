powerpc/booke: Only check for hugetlb in flush if vma != NULL

And in flush_hugetlb_page(), don't check whether vma is NULL after
we've already dereferenced it.

This was found by Dan using static analysis as described here:
https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/linuxppc-dev/2013-November/113161.html

We currently get away with this because the callers that currently pass
NULL for vma seem to be 32-bit-only (e.g. highmem, and
CONFIG_DEBUG_PGALLOC in pgtable_32.c)  Hugetlb is currently 64-bit only,
so we never saw a NULL vma here.
