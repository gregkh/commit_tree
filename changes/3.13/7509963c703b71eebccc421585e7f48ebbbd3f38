e1000e: Fix a compile flag mis-match for suspend/resume

This patch addresses a mis-match between the declaration and usage of
the e1000_suspend and e1000_resume functions.  Previously, these
functions were declared in a CONFIG_PM_SLEEP wrapper, and then utilized
within a CONFIG_PM wrapper.  Both the declaration and usage will now be
contained within CONFIG_PM wrappers.
