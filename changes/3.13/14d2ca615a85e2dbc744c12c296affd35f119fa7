ARM: GIC: interface to send a SGI directly

The regular gic_raise_softirq() takes as input a CPU mask which is not
adequate when we need to send an IPI to a CPU which is not represented
in the kernel to GIC mapping.  That is the case with the b.L switcher
when GIC migration to the inbound CPU has not yet occurred.
