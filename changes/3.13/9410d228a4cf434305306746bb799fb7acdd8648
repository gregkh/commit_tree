audit: call audit_bprm() only once to add AUDIT_EXECVE information

Move the audit_bprm() call from search_binary_handler() to exec_binprm().  This
allows us to get rid of the mm member of struct audit_aux_data_execve since
bprm->mm will equal current->mm.

This also mitigates the issue that ->argc could be modified by the
load_binary() call in search_binary_handler().

audit_bprm() was being called to add an AUDIT_EXECVE record to the audit
context every time search_binary_handler() was recursively called.  Only one
reference is necessary.

This patch is against 3.11, but was developed on Oleg's post-3.11 patches that
introduce exec_binprm().
