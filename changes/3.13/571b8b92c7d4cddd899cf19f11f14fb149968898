net/mlx4_core: Initialize all mailbox buffers to zero before use

To guarantee that all unused fields in all FW commands for both inboxes
and outboxes are zeroed out, initialize the mailbox buffer to all zeroes.

This is especially important for SRIOV comm-channel virtual commands
(such as QUERY_FUNC_CAP), where if new fields are added to support new
features, the driver can depend on older kernels passing zeroes in these
fields.

In addition to zeroing out the mailbox buffer at allocation time, all
(now unnecessary) calls to memset by the callers of
mlx4_alloc_cmd_mailbox() are removed.
