drm/i915: Fix pre-CTG vblank counter

The old style frame counter increments at the start of active video.
However for i915_get_vblank_counter() we want a counter that increments
at the start of vblank.

Fortunately the low frame counter register also contains the pixel
counter for the current frame. We can can compare that against the
vblank start pixel count to determine if we need to increment the
frame counter by 1 to get the correct answer.

Also reorganize the function pointer assignments in intel_irq_init() a
bit to avoid confusing people.
