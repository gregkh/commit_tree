batman-adv: include the sync-flags when compute the global/local table CRC

Flags covered by TT_SYNC_MASK are kept in sync among the
nodes in the network and therefore they have to be
considered while computing the global/local table CRC.

In this way a generic originator is able to understand if
its table contains the correct flags or not.

Bits from 4 to 7 in the TT flags fields are now reserved for
"synchronized" flags only.

This allows future developers to add more flags of this type
without breaking compatibility.

It's important to note that not all the remote TT flags are
synchronised. This comes from the fact that some flags are
used to inject an information once only.
