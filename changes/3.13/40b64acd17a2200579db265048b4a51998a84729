mm: fix build of split ptlock code

Commit 597d795a2a78 ('mm: do not allocate page->ptl dynamically, if
spinlock_t fits to long') restructures some allocators that are compiled
even if USE_SPLIT_PTLOCKS arn't used.  It results in compilation
failure:

  mm/memory.c:4282:6: error: 'struct page' has no member named 'ptl'
  mm/memory.c:4288:12: error: 'struct page' has no member named 'ptl'

Add in the missing ifdef.
