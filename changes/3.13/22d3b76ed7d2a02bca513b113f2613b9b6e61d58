isdn: Drop big endian cpp checks from telespci and hfc_pci drivers

With arm:allmodconfig, building the Teles PCI driver fails with

telespci.c:294:2: error: #error "not running on big endian machines now"

Similar, building the driver for HFC PCI-Bus cards fails with

hfc_pci.c:1647:2: error: #error "not running on big endian machines now"

Remove the big endian cpp check from both drivers to fix the build errors.
