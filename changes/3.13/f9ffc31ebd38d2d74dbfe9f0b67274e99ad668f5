rcu: Change EXPORT_SYMBOL() to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()

Commit e6b80a3b (rcu: Detect illegal rcu dereference in extended
quiescent state) exported the pre-existing rcu_is_cpu_idle() function
using EXPORT_SYMBOL().  However, this is inconsistent with the remaining
exports from RCU, which are all EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().  The current state
of affairs means that a non-GPL module could use rcu_is_cpu_idle(),
but in a CONFIG_TREE_PREEMPT_RCU=y kernel would be unable to invoke
rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock().

This commit therefore makes rcu_is_cpu_idle()'s export be consistent
with the rest of RCU, namely EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
