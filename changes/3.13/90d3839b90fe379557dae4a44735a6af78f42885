block: Use u64_stats_init() to initialize seqcounts

Now that seqcounts are lockdep enabled objects, we need to explicitly
initialize runtime allocated seqcounts so that lockdep can track them.

Without this patch, Fengguang was seeing:

Use u64_stats_init() for all affected data structures, which initializes
the seqcount.
