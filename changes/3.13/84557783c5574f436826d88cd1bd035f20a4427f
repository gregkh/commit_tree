isdn: eicon: free pointer after using it in log msg in divas_um_idi_delete_entity()

Not really a problem, but nice IMHO; the Coverity static analyzer
complains that we use the pointer 'e' after it has been freed, so move
the freeing below the final use, even if that use is just using the
value of the pointer and not actually dereferencing it.
