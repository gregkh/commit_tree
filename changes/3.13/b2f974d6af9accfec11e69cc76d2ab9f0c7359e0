tracing: Open tracer when ftrace_dump_on_oops is used

With ftrace_dump_on_oops, we previously did not open the tracer in
question, sometimes causing the trace output to be useless.

For example, the function_graph tracer with tracing_thresh set dumped via
ftrace_dump_on_oops would show a series of '}' indented at different levels,
but no function names.

call trace->open() (and do a few other fixups copied from the normal dump
path) to make the output more intelligible.
