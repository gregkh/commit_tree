drm/i915: Make l3 remapping use the ring

Using LRI for setting the remapping registers allows us to stream l3
remapping information. This is necessary to handle per context remaps as
we'll see implemented in an upcoming patch.

Using the ring also means we don't need to frob the DOP clock gating
bits.
