ALSA: hda - hdmi: Skip out-of-range latency values in AMD ELD generator

The ATI/AMD video/audio latencies are specified in apparent HDMI VSDB
format. In this format values above 251 are not valid (or stream
component is not supported - 255), but no checking is performed since
this was not mentioned in the AMD HDA verbs specification.

Check that the latencies are valid before using them, and add a comment
describing the formats.
