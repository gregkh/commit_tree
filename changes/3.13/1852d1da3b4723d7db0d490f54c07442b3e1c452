RDMA/ocrdma: Fix a crash in rmmod

1) ocrdma_remove_free() is called from a call_rcu callback funtion
   context, which can be a bottom-half context. So the code in
   ocrdma_remove_free should not sleep.

   But ocrdma_cleanup_hw() can sleep, So move it ocrdma_remove()
   instead of ocrdma_remove_free.

2) Fix a couple of kbuild test robot warnings.
