sched/numa: Prevent parallel updates to group stats during placement

Having multiple tasks in a group go through task_numa_placement
simultaneously can lead to a task picking a wrong node to run on, because
the group stats may be in the middle of an update. This patch avoids
parallel updates by holding the numa_group lock during placement
decisions.
