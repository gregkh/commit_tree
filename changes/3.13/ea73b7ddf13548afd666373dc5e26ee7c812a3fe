ASoC: dmaengine: Support custom channel names

Some devices have more than just simple TX and RX DMA channels, for example
modern Samsung I2S IPs support a secondary transmit DMA stream which is
mixed into the primary stream during playback. Allow such devices to
specify the names of the channels to be requested in their dma_data.
