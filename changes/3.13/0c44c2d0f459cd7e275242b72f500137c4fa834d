x86: Use asm goto to implement better modify_and_test() functions

Linus suggested using asm goto to get rid of the typical SETcc + TEST
instruction pair -- which also clobbers an extra register -- for our
typical modify_and_test() functions.

Because asm goto doesn't allow output fields it has to include an
unconditinal memory clobber when it changes a memory variable to force
a reload.

Luckily all atomic ops already imply a compiler barrier to go along
with their memory barrier semantics.
