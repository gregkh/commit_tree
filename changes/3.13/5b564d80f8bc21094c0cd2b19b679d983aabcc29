dm space map: disallow decrementing a reference count below zero

The old behaviour, returning -EINVAL if a ref_count of 0 would be
decremented, was removed in commit f722063 ("dm space map: optimise
sm_ll_dec and sm_ll_inc").  To fix this regression we return an error
code from the mutator function pointer passed to sm_ll_mutate() and have
dec_ref_count() return -EINVAL if the old ref_count is 0.

Add a DMERR to reflect the potential seriousness of this error.

Also, add missing dm_tm_unlock() to sm_ll_mutate()'s error path.

With this fix the following dmts regression test now passes:
 dmtest run --suite cache -n /metadata_use_kernel/

The next patch fixes the higher-level dm-array code that exposed this
regression.
