ARM: OMAP5: id: Remove ES1.0 support

OMAP5 ES1.0 was intended as a test chip and has major register level
differences w.r.t ES2.0 revision of the chip. All register defines,
dts support has been solely added for ES2.0 version of the chip.
Further, all ES1.0 chips and platforms are supposed to have been
removed from circulation. Hence, there is no need to further retain
any resemblence of ES1.0 support in id detection code.

Remove the omap_revision handling and BUG() instead to prevent folks
who mistakenly try an older unsupported chip and report bogus errors.
