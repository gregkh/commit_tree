Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP "Command Reject: Invalid CID" response

When the reason code in the L2CAP command reject is "invalid CID" there
should be four additional bytes of data in the PDU, namely the source
and destination CIDs (which should be zero if one or both are not
applicable). This patch fixes all occurrences of such errors to return
the right kind of PDU.
