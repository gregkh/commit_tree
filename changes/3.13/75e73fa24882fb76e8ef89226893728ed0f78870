spi: spi-mxs: Always clear INGORE_CRC, to keep CS asserted

INGORE_CRC, better named DEASSERT_CS, should be cleared on all tranfers
except the last.  So instead of only clearing it on the first transfer, we
can just always clear it.  It will set on the last transfer.

This removes the only use of the "first" flag in the transfer functions, so
that flag can be then be removed.
