netem: markov loss model transition fix

The transition from markov state "3 => lost packets within a burst
period" to "1 => successfully transmitted packets within a gap period"
has no *additional* loss event. The loss already happen for transition
from 1 -> 3, this additional loss will make things go wild.

E.g. transition probabilities:

p13:   10%
p31:  100%

Expected:

Ploss = p13 / (p13 + p31)
Ploss = ~9.09%

... but it isn't. Even worse: we get a double loss - each time.
So simple don't return true to indicate loss, rather break and return
false.
