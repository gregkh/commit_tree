KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Implement H_CONFER

The H_CONFER hypercall is used when a guest vcpu is spinning on a lock
held by another vcpu which has been preempted, and the spinning vcpu
wishes to give its timeslice to the lock holder.  We implement this
in the straightforward way using kvm_vcpu_yield_to().
