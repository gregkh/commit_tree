ipv4: IP_TOS and IP_TTL can be specified as ancillary data

This patch enables the IP_TTL and IP_TOS values passed from userspace to
be stored in the ipcm_cookie struct. Three fields are added to the struct:

- the TTL, expressed as __u8.
  The allowed values are in the [1-255].
  A value of 0 means that the TTL is not specified.

- the TOS, expressed as __s16.
  The allowed values are in the range [0,255].
  A value of -1 means that the TOS is not specified.

- the priority, expressed as a char and computed when
  handling the ancillary data.
