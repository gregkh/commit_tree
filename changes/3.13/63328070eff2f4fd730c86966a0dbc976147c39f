ARM: Correct BUG() assembly to ensure it is endian-agnostic

Currently BUG() uses .word or .hword to create the necessary illegal
instructions. However if we are building BE8 then these get swapped
by the linker into different illegal instructions in the text. This
means that the BUG() macro does not get trapped properly.

Change to using <asm/opcodes.h> to provide the necessary ARM instruction
building as we cannot rely on gcc/gas having the `.inst` instructions
which where added to try and resolve this issue (reported by Dave Martin
<Dave.Martin@arm.com>).
