sched_clock: Use an hrtimer instead of timer

In the next patch we're going to increase the number of bits that
the generic sched_clock can handle to be greater than 32. With
more than 32 bits the wraparound time can be larger than what can
fit into the units that msecs_to_jiffies takes (unsigned int).
Luckily, the wraparound is initially calculated in nanoseconds
which we can easily use with hrtimers, so switch to using an
hrtimer.
