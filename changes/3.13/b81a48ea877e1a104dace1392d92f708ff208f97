perf bench: Fix failing assertions in numa bench

Patch adds more subtle handling of -C and -N parameters in
parse_{cpu,node}_setup_list() functions when there isn't enough NUMA
nodes or CPUs present.  Instead of assertion and terminating benchmark,
partial test is skipped with error message and perf will continue to the
next one.

Fixed problem can be easily reproduced on machine with only one NUMA
node:

 # Running numa/mem benchmark...

  # Running main, "perf bench numa mem -a"

...

 # Running RAM-bw-remote, "perf bench numa mem -p 1 -t 1 -P 1024 -C 0 -M 1 -s
perf: bench/numa.c:622: parse_setup_node_list: Assertion `!(bind_node_0 < 0 ||
		bind_node_0 >= g->p.nr_nodes)' failed.
Aborted
