powerpc/windfarm: Fix XServe G5 fan control Makefile issue

We are missing building windfarm_max6690_sensor.o when building
CONFIG_WINDFARM_RM31. Usually all the windfarm drivers are built
and thus this isn't a problem but some more "tailored" setups
(Gentoo ?) building only that driver are not working because
the require sensor module is missing.
