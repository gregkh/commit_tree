DMA-API: dcdbas: update DMA mask handing

dcdbas was explicitly initializing DMA masks thusly:
	dcdbas_pdev->dev.coherent_dma_mask = DMA_BIT_MASK(32);
	dcdbas_pdev->dev.dma_mask = &dcdbas_pdev->dev.coherent_dma_mask;
which bypasses the architecture check.  Moreover, it is creating the
dcdbas_pdev device itself, and using the platform_device_register_full()
avoids some of this explicit initialization.

Convert the driver to use platform_device_register_full(), and as it
makes use of coherent DMA, also call dma_set_coherent_mask() to ensure
that the architecture gets to check the mask.
