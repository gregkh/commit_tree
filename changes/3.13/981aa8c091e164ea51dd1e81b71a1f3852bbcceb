bcache: bugfix - moving_gc now moves only correct buckets

Removed gc_move_threshold because picking buckets only by
threshold could lead moving extra buckets (ei. if there are
buckets at the threshold that aren't supposed to be moved
do to space considerations).

This is replaced by a GC_MOVE bit in the gc_mark bitmask.
Now only marked buckets get moved.
