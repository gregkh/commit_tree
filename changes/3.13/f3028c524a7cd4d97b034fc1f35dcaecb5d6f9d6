net: cdc_ncm: remove tx_speed and rx_speed fields

These fields are only used to prevent printing the same speeds
multiple times if we receive multiple identical speed notifications.

The value of these printk's is questionable, and even more so when
we filter out some of the notifications sent us by the firmware. If
we are going to print any of these, then we should print them all.

Removing little used fields is a bonus.
