ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Convert to direct regmap API usage

This is slightly more complex than a standard regmap conversion due to
the moderately detailed cache control and the open coding of a register
patch for the class D speaker on the TLV320AIC3007.

Although the device supports paging this is not currently implemented as
the additional pages are only used during the application of the patch
for the TLV320AIC3007.
