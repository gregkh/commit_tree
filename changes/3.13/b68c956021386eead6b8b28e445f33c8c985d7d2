IB/core: Make uverbs flow structure use names like verbs ones

This patch adds "flow" prefix to most of data structure added as part
of commit 436f2ad05a0b ("IB/core: Export ib_create/destroy_flow through
uverbs") to keep those names in sync with the data structures added in
commit 319a441d1361 ("IB/core: Add receive flow steering support").

It's just a matter of translating 'ib_flow' to 'ib_uverbs_flow'.
