xfs: vectorise remaining shortform dir2 ops

Following from the initial patch to introduce the directory
operations vector, convert the rest of the shortform directory
operations to use vectored ops rather than superblock feature
checks. This further reduces the size of the built binary:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 794490   96802    1096  892388   d9de4 fs/xfs/xfs.o.orig
 792986   96802    1096  890884   d9804 fs/xfs/xfs.o.p1
 792350   96802    1096  890248   d9588 fs/xfs/xfs.o.p2
