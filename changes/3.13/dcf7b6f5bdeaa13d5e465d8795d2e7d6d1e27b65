cxgb4: Add API to correctly calculate tuple fields

Adds API cxgb4_select_ntuple so as to enable Upper Level Drivers to correctly
calculate the tuple fields.

Adds constant definitions for TP_VLAN_PRI_MAP for the Compressed
Filter Tuple field widths and structures and uses them.

Also, the CPL Parameters field for T5 is 40 bits so we need to prototype
cxgb4_select_ntuple() to calculate and return u64 values.
