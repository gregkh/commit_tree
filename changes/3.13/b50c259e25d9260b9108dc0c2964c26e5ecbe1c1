md/raid10: fix two bugs in handling of known-bad-blocks.

If we discover a bad block when reading we split the request and
potentially read some of it from a different device.

The code path of this has two bugs in RAID10.
1/ we get a spin_lock with _irq, but unlock without _irq!!
2/ The calculation of 'sectors_handled' is wrong, as can be clearly
   seen by comparison with raid1.c

This leads to at least 2 warnings and a probable crash is a RAID10
ever had known bad blocks.
