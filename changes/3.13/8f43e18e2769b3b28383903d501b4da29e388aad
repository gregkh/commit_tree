pwm-backlight: Allow for non-increasing brightness levels

Currently the driver assumes that the values specified in the
brightness-levels device tree property increase as they are parsed from
left to right.  But boards that invert the signal between the PWM output
and the backlight will need to specify decreasing brightness-levels.
This patch removes the assumption that the last element of the array is
the maximum value, and instead searches the array for the maximum value
and uses that in the duty cycle calculation.
