rcu: Add tracing of normal (non-NOCB) grace-period requests

This commit adds tracing to the normal grace-period request points.
These are rcu_gp_cleanup(), which checks for the need for another
grace period at the end of the previous grace period, and
rcu_start_gp_advanced(), which restarts RCU's state machine after
an idle period.  These trace events are intended to help track down
bugs where RCU remains idle despite there being work for it to do.
