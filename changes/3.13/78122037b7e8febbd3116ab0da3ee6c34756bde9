audit: do not reject all AUDIT_INODE filter types

commit ab61d38ed8cf670946d12dc46b9198b521c790ea tried to merge the
invalid filter checking into a single function.  However AUDIT_INODE
filters were not verified in the new generic checker.  Thus such rules
were being denied even though they were perfectly valid.

Ex:
$ auditctl -a exit,always -F arch=b64 -S open -F key=/foo -F inode=6955 -F devmajor=9 -F devminor=1
Error sending add rule data request (Invalid argument)
