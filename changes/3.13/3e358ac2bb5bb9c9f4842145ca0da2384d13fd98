firmware: Be a bit more verbose about direct firmware loading failure

The direct firmware loading interface is a bit quiet about failures.  Failures
that occur during loading are masked if firmware exists in multiple locations,
and may be masked entirely in the event that we fall back to the user mode
helper code.  It would be nice to see some of the more unexpected errors get
logged, so in the event that you expect the direct firmware loader to work (like
if CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER is enabled), and something goes wrong, you can
figure out what happened.
