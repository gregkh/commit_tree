bcache: Debug code improvements

Couple changes:
 * Consolidate bch_check_keys() and bch_check_key_order(), and move the
   checks that only check_key_order() could do to bch_btree_iter_next().

 * Get rid of CONFIG_BCACHE_EDEBUG - now, all that code is compiled in
   when CONFIG_BCACHE_DEBUG is enabled, and there's now a sysfs file to
   flip on the EDEBUG checks at runtime.

 * Dropped an old not terribly useful check in rw_unlock(), and
   refactored/improved a some of the other debug code.
