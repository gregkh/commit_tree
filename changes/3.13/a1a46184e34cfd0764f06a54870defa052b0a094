mm: numa: Do not migrate or account for hinting faults on the zero page

The zero page is not replicated between nodes and is often shared between
processes. The data is read-only and likely to be cached in local CPUs
if heavily accessed meaning that the remote memory access cost is less
of a concern. This patch prevents trapping faults on the zero pages. For
tasks using the zero page this will reduce the number of PTE updates,
TLB flushes and hinting faults.
