ext4: Do not reserve clusters when fs doesn't support extents

When the filesystem doesn't support extents (like in ext2/3
compatibility modes), there is no need to reserve any clusters. Space
estimates for writing are exact, hole punching doesn't need new
metadata, and there are no unwritten extents to convert.

This fixes a problem when filesystem still having some free space when
accessed with a native ext2/3 driver suddently reports ENOSPC when
accessed with ext4 driver.
