gso: handle new frag_list of frags GRO packets

Recently GRO started generating packets with frag_lists of frags.
This was not handled by GSO, thus leading to a crash.

Thankfully these packets are of a regular form and are easy to
handle.  This patch handles them in two ways.  For completely
non-linear frag_list entries, we simply continue to iterate over
the frag_list frags once we exhaust the normal frags.  For frag_list
entries with linear parts, we call pskb_trim on the first part
of the frag_list skb, and then process the rest of the frags in
the usual way.

This patch also kills a chunk of dead frag_list code that has
obviously never ever been run since it ends up generating a bogus
GSO-segmented packet with a frag_list entry.

Future work is planned to split super big packets into TSO
ones.
