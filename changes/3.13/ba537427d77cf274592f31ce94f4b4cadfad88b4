tcp: use ACCESS_ONCE() in tcp_update_pacing_rate()

sk_pacing_rate is read by sch_fq packet scheduler at any time,
with no synchronization, so make sure we update it in a
sensible way. ACCESS_ONCE() is how we instruct compiler
to not do stupid things, like using the memory location
as a temporary variable.
