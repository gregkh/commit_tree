net: use lists as arguments instead of bool upper

Currently we make use of bool upper when we want to specify if we want to
work with upper/lower list. It's, however, harder to read, debug and
occupies a lot more code.

Fix this by just passing the correct upper/lower_dev_list list_head pointer
instead of bool upper, and work internally with it.
