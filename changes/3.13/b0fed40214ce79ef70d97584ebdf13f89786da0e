audit: implement generic feature setting and retrieving

The audit_status structure was not designed with extensibility in mind.
Define a new AUDIT_SET_FEATURE message type which takes a new structure
of bits where things can be enabled/disabled/locked one at a time.  This
structure should be able to grow in the future while maintaining forward
and backward compatibility (based loosly on the ideas from capabilities
and prctl)

This does not actually add any features, but is just infrastructure to
allow new on/off types of audit system features.
