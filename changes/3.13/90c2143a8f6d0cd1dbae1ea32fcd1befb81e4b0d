mmc: dw_mmc: guarantee stop-abort cmd in data errors

In error cases, DTO interrupt may or may not be generated depending
on remained data. Stop/Abort command ensures DTO generation for that
situation. Currently if 'stop' field of data is empty, there is no
stop/abort command. So, it could hang waiting DTO. This change
reinforces these cases.
