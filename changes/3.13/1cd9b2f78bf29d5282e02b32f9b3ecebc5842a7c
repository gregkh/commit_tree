ALSA: hda - Fix bad EAPD setup for HP machines with AD1984A

It seems that EAPD on NID 0x16 is the only control over all outputs on
HP machines with AD1984A while turning EAPD on NID 0x12 breaks the
output.  Thus we need to avoid fiddling EAPD on NID.  As a quick
workaround, just set own_eapd_ctrl flag for the wrong EAPD, then
implement finer EAPD controls.
