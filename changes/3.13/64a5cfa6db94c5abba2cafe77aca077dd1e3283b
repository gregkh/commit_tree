Allow setting per-file compression via SMB2/3

Allow cifs/smb2/smb3 to return whether or not a file is compressed
via lsattr, and allow SMB2/SMB3 to set the per-file compression
flag ("chattr +c filename" on an smb3 mount).

Windows users often set the compressed flag (it can be
done from the desktop and file manager).  David Disseldorp
has patches to Samba server to support this (at least on btrfs)
which are complementary to this
