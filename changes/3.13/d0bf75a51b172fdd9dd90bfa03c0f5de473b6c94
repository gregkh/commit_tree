Bluetooth: Add the definition and structure for Set Reserved LT_ADDR

The Set_Reserved_LT_ADDR command allows the host to request that the
BR/EDR Controller reserve a specific LT_ADDR for Connectionless Slave
Broadcast.

The Core Spec Addendum 4 adds this command in part B Connectionless
Slave Broadcast.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 4 - Page 90

"7.3.86 Set Reserved LT_ADDR Command [New Section]
...
If the LT_ADDR indicated in the LT_ADDR parameter is already in use by the
BR/EDR Controller, it shall return the ACL Connection Already Exists (0x0B)
error code. If the LT_ADDR indicated in the LT_ADDR parameter is out of
range, the controller shall return the Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12)
error code. If the command succeeds, then the reserved LT_ADDR shall be
used when issuing subsequent Set Connectionless Slave Broadcast Data and
Set Connectionless Slave Broadcast commands.
To ensure that the reserved LT_ADDR is not already allocated, it is
recommended that this command be issued at some point after HCI_Reset is
issued but before page scanning is enabled or paging is initiated."
