NTB: Enable Snoop on Primary Side

Enable Snoop from Primary to Secondary side on BAR23 and BAR45 on all
TLPs.  Previously, Snoop was only enabled from Secondary to Primary
side.  This can have a performance improvement on some workloads.

Also, make the code more obvious about how the link is being enabled.
