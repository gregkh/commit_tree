drm/i915; Preallocate the lazy request

It is possible for us to be forced to perform an allocation for the lazy
request whilst running the shrinker. This allocation may fail, leaving
us unable to reclaim any memory leading to premature OOM. A neat
solution to the problem is to preallocate the request at the same time
as acquiring the seqno for the ring transaction. This means that we can
report ENOMEM prior to touching the rings.
