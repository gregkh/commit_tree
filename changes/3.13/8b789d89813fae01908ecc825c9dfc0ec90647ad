ahci: imx: setup power saving methods

In order to save power consumption as much as possible.

* Disable sata phy internal pll reference clock when sysetem enter
  into suspend mode, enable it after resume.

* Setup module parameter used to enable imx ahci test power down
  mode(PDDQ) or not, when there is no device detected on the port

* minor modifications:
  - The format of the copyright is changed, because that the original
    one can't pass fsl internal patch reivew without the character
    '(c)'.
  - Exports ahci_platform_ops and ahci_error_handler().

NOTE:
* The hot-plug can't be supported when PDDQ mode is ever enabled.

* module parameter usage how-to:
  - default: enable PDDQ mode when no device detected.
  - add "ahci-imx.hotplug=1" into kernel command line if your don't
    want to enable PDDQ mode when no device detected on the port.
