mtd: m25p80: remove 'disabled' device check

It seems like the following commit was never necessary

        mtd: m25p80: don't probe device which has status of 'disabled'

because it duplicates the code in of_platform_device_create_pdata()
which ensures that 'disabled' nodes are never instantiated.

Also, drop the __maybe_unused.
