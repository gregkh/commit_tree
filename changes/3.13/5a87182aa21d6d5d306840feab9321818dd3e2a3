cpufreq: suspend governors on system suspend/hibernate

This patch adds cpufreq suspend/resume calls to dpm_{suspend|resume}_noirq()
for handling suspend/resume of cpufreq governors.

Lan Tianyu (Intel) & Jinhyuk Choi (Broadcom) found anr issue where
tunables configuration for clusters/sockets with non-boot CPUs was
getting lost after suspend/resume, as we were notifying governors
with CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_EXIT on removal of the last cpu for that
policy and so deallocating memory for tunables. This is fixed by
this patch as we don't allow any operation on governors after
device suspend and before device resume now.
