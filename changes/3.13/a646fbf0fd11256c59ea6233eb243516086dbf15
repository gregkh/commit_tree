iio: use anon_inode_getfd() with O_CLOEXEC flag

IIO uses anon_inode_get() to allocate file descriptors as part
of its ioctls. But those ioctls are lacking a flag argument
allowing userspace to choose options for the newly opened file
descriptor.

In such case it's advised to use O_CLOEXEC by default so that
userspace is allowed to choose, without race, if the file descriptor
is going to be inherited across exec().

KVM usage of anon_inode_getfd() was fixed in a previous patchset [1],
so IIO is the only subsystem using anon_inode_getfd() with a fixed set
of flags not including O_CLOEXEC.

This patch set O_CLOEXEC flag on the event file descriptor created
with anon_inode_getfd() to not leak file descriptors across exec().
