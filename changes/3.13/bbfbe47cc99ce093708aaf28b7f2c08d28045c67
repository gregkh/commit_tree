tipc: simplify the link lookup routine

When checking statistics or changing parameters on a link, the
link_find_link function is used to locate the link with a given
name. The complex method of deconstructing the name into local
and remote address/interface is error prone and may fail if the
interface names contains special characters. We change the lookup
method to iterate over the list of nodes and compare the link
names.
