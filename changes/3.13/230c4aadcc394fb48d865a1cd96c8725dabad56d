ARC: perf: ARC 700 PMU doesn't support sampling events

The ARC 700 does not have an interrupt associated with it, and as
such it cannot trigger when a counter overflows. As the counters are
48 bit, it will usually take at least 100 days before a counter
overflows, so for mere counting of events, there is no problem.
Sampling is not supported though.
