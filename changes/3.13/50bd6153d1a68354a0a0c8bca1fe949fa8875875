Code update interface for powernv platform. This provides
sysfs interface to pass new image, validate, update and
commit images.

This patch includes:
  - Below OPAL APIs for code update
    - opal_validate_flash()
    - opal_manage_flash()
    - opal_update_flash()

  - Create below sysfs files under /sys/firmware/opal
    - image		: Interface to pass new FW image
    - validate_flash	: Validate candidate image
    - manage_flash	: Commit/Reject operations
    - update_flash	: Flash new candidate image

Updating Image:
  "update_flash" is an interface to indicate flash new FW.
It just passes image SG list to FW. Actual flashing is done
during system reboot time.

Note:
  - SG entry format:
    I have kept version number to keep this list similar to what
    PAPR is defined.
