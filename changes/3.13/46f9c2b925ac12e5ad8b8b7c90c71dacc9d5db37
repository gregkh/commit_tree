virtio_ring: change host notification API

Currently a host kick error is silently ignored and not reflected in
the virtqueue of a particular virtio device.

Changing the notify API for guest->host notification seems to be one
prerequisite in order to be able to handle such errors in the context
where the kick is triggered.

This patch changes the notify API. The notify function must return a
bool return value. It returns false if the host notification failed.
