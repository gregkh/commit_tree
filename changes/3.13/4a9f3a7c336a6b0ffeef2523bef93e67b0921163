efi: Generalize relocate_kernel() for use by other architectures.

Rename relocate_kernel() to efi_relocate_kernel(), and take
parameters rather than x86 specific structure.  Add max_addr
argument as for ARM we have some address constraints that we
need to enforce when relocating the kernel.  Add alloc_size
parameter for use by ARM64 which uses an uncompressed kernel,
and needs to allocate space for BSS.
