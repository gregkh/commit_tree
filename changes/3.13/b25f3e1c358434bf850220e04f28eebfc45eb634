ARM: 7938/1: OMAP4/highbank: Flush L2 cache before disabling

Kexec disables outer cache before jumping to reboot code, but it doesn't
flush it explicitly. Flush is done implicitly inside of l2x0_disable().
But some SoC's override default .disable handler and don't flush cache.
This may lead to a corrupted memory during Kexec reboot on these
platforms.

This patch adds cache flush inside of OMAP4 and Highbank outer_cache.disable()
handlers to make it consistent with default l2x0_disable().
