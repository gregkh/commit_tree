ACPICA: Add history/line-editing for Unix/Linux systems.

The original upstream ACPICA change added full history and limited
line editing to the debugger:

 This change adds full history and limited line editing for Unix and
 Linux systems. It does not use readline() because of portability issues.
 Instead it uses the POSIX termio interface to put the terminal in raw
 input mode so that the various special keys can be trapped (such as
 up-arrow and down-arrow for history support).

Since the debugger is not shipped in the kernel, it only is necessary
to update one header file to keep the kernel source in sync with the
upstream.
