ASoC: pcm: Fix rate_max calculation

In order to make sure that the sample rate is in the supported range of both
components the maximum rate of the card should be the minimum of the maximum
rate of each components. There is one special case to consider though, if
max_rate is set to 0 this means there is no maximum specified, so use
min_not_zero() macro which will give use the desired result.
