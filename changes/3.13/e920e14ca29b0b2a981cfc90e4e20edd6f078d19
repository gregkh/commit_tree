mm: Do not flush TLB during protection change if !pte_present && !migration_entry

NUMA PTE scanning is expensive both in terms of the scanning itself and
the TLB flush if there are any updates. Currently non-present PTEs are
accounted for as an update and incurring a TLB flush where it is only
necessary for anonymous migration entries. This patch addresses the
problem and should reduce TLB flushes.
