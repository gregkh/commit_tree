sched/fair: Fix the group_capacity computation

Do away with 'phantom' cores due to N*frac(smt_power) >= 1 by limiting
the capacity to the actual number of cores.

The assumption of 1 < smt_power < 2 is an actual requirement because
of what SMT is so this should work regardless of the SMT
implementation.

It can still be defeated by creative use of cpu hotplug, but if you're
one of those freaks, you get to live with it.
