alarmtimer: return EINVAL instead of ENOTSUPP if rtcdev doesn't exist

Fedora Ruby maintainer reported latest Ruby doesn't work on Fedora Rawhide
on ARM. (http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9008)

Because of, commit 1c6b39ad3f (alarmtimers: Return -ENOTSUPP if no
RTC device is present) intruduced to return ENOTSUPP when
clock_get{time,res} can't find a RTC device. However this is incorrect.

First, ENOTSUPP isn't exported to userland (ENOTSUP or EOPNOTSUP are the
closest userland equivlents).

Second, Posix and Linux man pages agree that clock_gettime and
clock_getres should return EINVAL if clk_id argument is invalid.
While the arugment that the clockid is valid, but just not supported
on this hardware could be made, this is just a technicality that
doesn't help userspace applicaitons, and only complicates error
handling.

Thus, this patch changes the code to use EINVAL.
