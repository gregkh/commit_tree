rcu: Flag lockless access to ->gp_flags with ACCESS_ONCE()

This commit applies ACCESS_ONCE() to an outside-of-lock access to
->gp_flags.  Although it is hard to imagine any sane compiler messing
this particular case up, the documentation benefits are substantial.
Plus the definition of "sane compiler" grows ever looser.
