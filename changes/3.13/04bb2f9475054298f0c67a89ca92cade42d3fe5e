sched/numa: Adjust scan rate in task_numa_placement

Adjust numa_scan_period in task_numa_placement, depending on how much
useful work the numa code can do. The more local faults there are in a
given scan window the longer the period (and hence the slower the scan rate)
during the next window. If there are excessive shared faults then the scan
period will decrease with the amount of scaling depending on whether the
ratio of shared/private faults. If the preferred node changes then the
scan rate is reset to recheck if the task is properly placed.
