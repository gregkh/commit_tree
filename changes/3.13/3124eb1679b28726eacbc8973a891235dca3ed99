sysfs: merge regular and bin file handling

With the previous changes, sysfs regular file code is ready to handle
bin files too.  This patch makes bin files share the regular file
path.

* sysfs_create/remove_bin_file() are moved to fs/sysfs/file.c.

* sysfs_init_inode() is updated to use the new sysfs_bin_operations
  instead of bin_fops for bin files.

* fs/sysfs/bin.c and the related pieces are removed.

This patch shouldn't introduce any behavior difference to bin file
accesses.

Overall, this unification reduces the amount of duplicate logic, makes
behaviors more consistent and paves the road for building simpler and
more versatile interface which will allow other subsystems to make use
of sysfs for their pseudo filesystems.

v2: Stale fs/sysfs/bin.c reference dropped from
    Documentation/DocBook/filesystems.tmpl.  Reported by kbuild test
    robot.
