ARM: mmp: delete the custom GPIO header

The MMP sub-architecture appears to have a custom <mach/gpio.h>
for no reason whatsoever. The file became completely empty
after Haojian removed the remaining content in
commit 157d2644cb0c1e71a18baaffca56d2b1d0ebf10f
"ARM: pxa: change gpio to platform device".
