iio:buffer: Add proper locking for iio_update_buffers()

We need to make sure that in-kernel users of iio_update_buffers() do not race
against each other or against unregistration of the device. So we need to take
both the mlock and the info_exist_lock when calling iio_update_buffers() from a
in-kernel consumer.
