ALSA: hda - hdmi: Add error-checking to some codec reads

Add error checks to HBR status reads (both generic and ATI/AMD) and
ATI/AMD codec reads for ELD generation.

Unchecked errors in these just caused more errors later on (invalid
codec writes for the HBR ones and ELD parsing errors for the ATI/AMD ELD
ones), but it is better to catch them earlier.
