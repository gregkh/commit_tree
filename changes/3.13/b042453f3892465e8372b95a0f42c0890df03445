ACPI: Add Toshiba NB100 to Vista _OSI blacklist

This patch adds Toshiba NB100 to the Vista _OSI blacklist.

The _OSI(Windows 2006) method is bugged on the netbook resulting in
messed up PCI IRQ Routing information. This was observed on a netbook
whose SATA controller mode was set to Compatibility mode.

The controller would then issue IRQs to IRQ#16 instead of
IRQ#20, where it should have been.

No side-effects were found during testing, everything is
working as it did before.
