dm cache: promotion optimisation for writes

If a write block triggers promotion and covers a whole block we can
avoid a copy.

Introduce dm_{hook,unhook}_bio to simplify saving and restoring bio
fields (bi_private is now used by overwrite).  Switch writethrough
support over to using these helpers too.
