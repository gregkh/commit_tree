xen-netback: clear vif->task on disconnect

xenvif_start_xmit() relies on checking vif->task for NULL to determine
whether the vif is ready to accept packets. The task thread is stopped in
xenvif_disconnect() but task is not set to NULL. Thus, on a re-connect the
check will give a false positive.

Also since commit ea732dff5cfa10789007bf4a5b935388a0bb2a8f (Handle backend
state transitions in a more robust way) it should not be possible for
xenvif_connect() to be called if the vif is already connected so change the
check of vif->tx_irq to a BUG_ON() and also add a BUG_ON(vif->task).
