ocfs2: delay migration when the lockres is in migration state

We trigger a bug in __dlm_lockres_reserve_ast() when we parallel umount 4
nodes.  The situation is as follows:

1) Node A migrate all lockres it owned(eg.  lockres A) to other nodes
   say node B when it umounts.

2) Receiving MIG_LOCKRES message from A, Node B masters the lockres A
   with DLM_LOCK_RES_MIGRATING state set.

3) Then we umount ocfs2 on node B.  It also should migrate lockres A to
   another node, say node C.  But now, DLM_LOCK_RES_MIGRATING state of
   lockers A is not cleared.  Node B triggered the BUG on lockres with
   state DLM_LOCK_RES_MIGRATING.
