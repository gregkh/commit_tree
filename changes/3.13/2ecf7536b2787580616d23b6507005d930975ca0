quota/genetlink: use proper genetlink multicast APIs

The quota code is abusing the genetlink API and is using
its family ID as the multicast group ID, which is invalid
and may belong to somebody else (and likely will.)

Make the quota code use the correct API, but since this
is already used as-is by userspace, reserve a family ID
for this code and also reserve that group ID to not break
userspace assumptions.
