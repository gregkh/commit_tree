mtd: nand: omap: clean-up ecc layout for BCH ecc schemes

In current implementation omap3_init_bch_tail() is a common function to
define ecc layout for different BCHx ecc schemes.This patch:
(1) removes omap3_init_bch_tail() and defines ecc layout for individual
    ecc-schemes along with populating their nand_chip->ecc data in
    omap_nand_probe(). This improves the readability and scalability of
    code for add new ecc schemes in future.
(2) removes 'struct nand_bbt_descr bb_descrip_flashbased' because default
    nand_bbt_descr in nand_bbt.c matches the same (.len=1 for x8 devices).
(3) add the check to see if NAND device has enough OOB/Spare bytes to
    store ECC signature of whole page, as defined by ecc-scheme.
