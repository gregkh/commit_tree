staging: comedi: pcl711: no need to calc the timer values twice

The comedi core always calls the (*do_cmdtest) function to validate
a command before it calls the (*do_cmd) function.

Since the (*do_cmdtest) has already calculated the timer values in
order to validate the cmd->scan_begin_arg there is no reason to
recalc the values in the (*do_cmd).

This also fixes a bug in the driver. The (*do_cmdtest) was using a
time base value of 100 and but the (*do_cmd) was using a time base
of 500. These result in different timer values. The functions used
to calculate the values are actually the same due to a #define in
the 8253.h header.
