x86/UV: Move NMI support

This patch moves the UV NMI support from the x2apic file to a
new separate uv_nmi.c file in preparation for the next sequence
of patches. It prevents upcoming bloat of the x2apic file, and
has the added benefit of putting the upcoming /sys/module
parameters under the name 'uv_nmi' instead of 'x2apic_uv_x',
which was obscure.
