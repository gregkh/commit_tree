PCI: mvebu: Return 'unsupported' for Interrupt Line and Interrupt Pin

The emulated bridge does not support interrupts, so it should return the
value 0 for Interrupt Line and Interrupt Pin.  This indicates that
interrupts are not supported.

Since Max_Lat and Min_Gnt are also in the same 32-bit word, we return
0 for them, which means "do not care."

This corrects an error message from the kernel:

  pci 0000:00:01.0: of_irq_parse_pci() failed with rc=135

Which is due to the default return of 0xFFFFFFFF indicating that
interrupts are supported.

The error message regression was caused by 16b84e5a505 ("of/irq: Create
of_irq_parse_and_map_pci() to consolidate arch code.")
