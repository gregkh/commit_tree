libata: implement ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM and apply it to Micro M500 SSDs

Certain drives cannot handle queued TRIM commands properly, even
though support is indicated in the IDENTIFY DEVICE buffer.  This patch
allows for disabling the commands for the affected drives and apply it
to the Micron/Crucial M500 SSDs which exhibit incorrect protocol
behavior when issued queued TRIM commands, which could lead to silent
data corruption.

tj: Merged two unnecessarily split patches and made minor edits
    including shortening horkage name.
