drm/i915: Don't grab crtc mutexes in intel_modeset_gem_init()

When the pipe A force quirk is applied the code will attempt to grab
a crtc mutex during intel_modeset_setup_hw_state(). If we're already
holding all crtc mutexes this will obviously deadlock every time.

So instead of using drm_modeset_lock_all() just grab the
mode_config.mutex. This is enough to avoid the unlocked mutex warnings
from certain lower level functions.

The regression was introduced in:
