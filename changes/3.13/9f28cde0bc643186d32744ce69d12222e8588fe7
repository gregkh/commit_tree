ARM: another fix for the DMA mapping checks

Peter reports that OMAP audio broke with the recent fix for these
checks, caused by OMAP audio using a 64-bit DMA mask.  We should
allow 64-bit DMA masks even with 32-bit dma_addr_t if we can be sure
the amount of RAM we have won't allow the 32-bit dma_addr_t to
overflow.  Unfortunately, the checks to detect overflow were not
correct.
