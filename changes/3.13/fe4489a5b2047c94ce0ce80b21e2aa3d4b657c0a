staging: comedi: pcl711: fix pcl711_set_changain()

Currently the board->is_8112 handling in this function does not write
the value to the mux register. Also, the value for channels >= 8 is
calculated incorrectly.

Define the magic numbers used with the mux register and fix the function
so 8112 boards work correctly.
