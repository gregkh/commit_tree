uprobes: Teach uprobe_copy_process() to handle CLONE_VFORK

uprobe_copy_process() does nothing if the child shares ->mm with
the forking process, but there is a special case: CLONE_VFORK.
In this case it would be more correct to do dup_utask() but avoid
dup_xol(). This is not that important, the child should not unwind
its stack too much, this can corrupt the parent's stack, but at
least we need this to allow to ret-probe __vfork() itself.

Note: in theory, it would be better to check task_pt_regs(p)->sp
instead of CLONE_VFORK, we need to dup_utask() if and only if the
child can return from the function called by the parent. But this
needs the arch-dependant helper, and I think that nobody actually
does clone(same_stack, CLONE_VM).
