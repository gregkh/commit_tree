bonding: correctly verify for the first slave in bond_enslave

After commit 1f718f0f4f97145f4072d2d72dcf85069ca7226d ("bonding: populate
neighbour's private on enslave"), we've moved the actual 'linking' in the
end of the function - so that, once linked, the slave is ready to be used,
and is not still in the process of enslaving.

However, 802.3ad verified if it's the first slave by looking at the

if (bond_first_slave(bond) == new_slave)

which, because we've moved the linking to the end, became broken - on the
first slave bond_first_slave(bond) returns NULL.

Fix this by verifying if the prev_slave, that equals bond_last_slave(), is
actually populated - if it is - then it's not the first slave, and vice
versa.
