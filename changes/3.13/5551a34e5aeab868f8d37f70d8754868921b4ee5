x86-64, build: Always pass in -mno-sse

Always pass in the -mno-sse argument, regardless if
-preferred-stack-boundary is supported.  We never want to generate SSE
instructions in the kernel unless we *really* know what we're doing.

According to H. J. Lu, any version of gcc new enough that we support
it at all should handle the -mno-sse option, so just add it
unconditionally.
