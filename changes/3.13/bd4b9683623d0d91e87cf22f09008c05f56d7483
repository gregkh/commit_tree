sb_edac: Shut up compiler warning when EDAC_DEBUG is enabled

Fix this:

In file included from drivers/edac/sb_edac.c:27:0:
drivers/edac/sb_edac.c: In function ‘sbridge_mce_output_error’:
drivers/edac/edac_core.h:50:8: warning: ‘limit’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  printk(level "EDAC " prefix ": " fmt, ##arg)
        ^
drivers/edac/sb_edac.c:948:25: note: ‘limit’ was declared here
  u64   ch_addr, offset, limit, prv = 0;

Limit can be initialized to 0. The only way limit wouldn't be
initialized is if there are no DIMMs present (which would be a bug of
course) and it'd fail on the next test.
