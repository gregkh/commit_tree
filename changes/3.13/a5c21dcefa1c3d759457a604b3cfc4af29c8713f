dcache: allow word-at-a-time name hashing with big-endian CPUs

When explicitly hashing the end of a string with the word-at-a-time
interface, we have to be careful which end of the word we pick up.

On big-endian CPUs, the upper-bits will contain the data we're after, so
ensure we generate our masks accordingly (and avoid hashing whatever
random junk may have been sitting after the string).

This patch adds a new dcache helper, bytemask_from_count, which creates
a mask appropriate for the CPU endianness.
