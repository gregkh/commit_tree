rcu: Silence unused-variable warnings

The "idle" variable in both rcu_eqs_enter_common() and
rcu_eqs_exit_common() is only used in a WARN_ON_ONCE().  If the kernel
is built disabling WARN_ON_ONCE(), the compiler will complain (rightly)
that "idle" is unused.  This commit therefore adds a __maybe_unused to
the declaration of both variables.
