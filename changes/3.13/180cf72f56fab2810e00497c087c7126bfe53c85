netfilter: nf_ct_sip: consolidate NAT hook functions

There are currently seven different NAT hooks used in both
nf_conntrack_sip and nf_nat_sip, each of the hooks is exported in
nf_conntrack_sip, then set from the nf_nat_sip NAT helper.

And because each of them is exported there is quite some overhead
introduced due of this.

By introducing nf_nat_sip_hooks I am able to reduce both text/data
somewhat.  For nf_conntrack_sip e. g. I get

        text             data              bss              dec
old    15243             5256               32            20531
new    15010             5192               32            20234
