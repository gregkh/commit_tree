ALSA: hda - Add enable_msi=0 workaround for four HP machines

While enabling these machines, we found we would sometimes lose an
interrupt if we change hardware volume during playback, and that
disabling msi fixed this issue. (Losing the interrupt caused underruns
and crackling audio, as the one second timeout is usually bigger than
the period size.)

The machines were all machines from HP, running AMD Hudson controller,
and Realtek ALC282 codec.
