Docs: arm64: booting: clarify boot requirements

There are a few points in the arm64 booting document which are unclear
(such as the initial state of secondary CPUs), and/or have not been
documented (PSCI is a supported mechanism for booting secondary CPUs).

This patch amends the arm64 boot document to better express the
(existing) requirements, and to describe PSCI as a supported booting
mechanism.
