Revert "drm: copy mode type in drm_mode_connector_list_update()"

This reverts commit 3fbd6439e4639ecaeaae6c079e0aa497a1ac3482.

This caused some strange booting lockup issues on an Intel G33
belonging to Daniel Vetter, very unusual, I was hoping Daniel
would track this down, but it looks like instead I'll have to hack
a different fix for -next.
