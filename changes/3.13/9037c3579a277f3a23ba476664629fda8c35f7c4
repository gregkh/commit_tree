ip6_output: fragment outgoing reassembled skb properly

If reassembled packet would fit into outdev MTU, it is not fragmented
according the original frag size and it is send as single big packet.

The second case is if skb is gso. In that case fragmentation does not happen
according to the original frag size.

This patch fixes these.
