HID: uhid: fix leak for 64/32 UHID_CREATE

UHID allows short writes so user-space can omit unused fields. We
automatically set them to 0 in the kernel. However, the 64/32 bit
compat-handler didn't do that in the UHID_CREATE fallback. This will
reveal random kernel heap data (of random size, even) to user-space.
