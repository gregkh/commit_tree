ARM: 7862/1: pcpu: replace __get_cpu_var_uses

This is the ARM part of Christoph's patchset cleaning up the various
uses of __get_cpu_var across the tree.

The idea is to convert __get_cpu_var into either an explicit address
calculation using this_cpu_ptr() or into a use of this_cpu operations
that use the offset. Thereby address calculations are avoided and fewer
registers are used when code is generated.

[will: fixed debug ref counting checks and pcpu array accesses]
