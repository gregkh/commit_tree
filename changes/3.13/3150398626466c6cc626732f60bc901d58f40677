sched: Remove {set,clear}_need_resched

Preemption semantics are going to change which mandate a change.

All DRM usage sites are already broken and will not be affected (much)
by this change. DRM people are aware and will remove the last few
stragglers.

For now, leave an empty stub that generates a warning, once all users
are gone we can remove this.
