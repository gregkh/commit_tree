sh: always link in helper functions extracted from libgcc

E.g. landisk_defconfig, which has CONFIG_NTFS_FS=m:

  ERROR: "__ashrdi3" [fs/ntfs/ntfs.ko] undefined!

For "lib-y", if no symbols in a compilation unit are referenced by other
units, the compilation unit will not be included in vmlinux.  This
breaks modules that do reference those symbols.

Use "obj-y" instead to fix this.

This doesn't fix all cases. There are others, e.g. udivsi3.
This is also not limited to sh, many architectures handle this in the
same way.

A simple solution is to unconditionally include all helper functions.
A more complex solution is to make the choice of "lib-y" or "obj-y" depend
on CONFIG_MODULES:

  obj-$(CONFIG_MODULES) += ...
  lib-y($CONFIG_MODULES) += ...
