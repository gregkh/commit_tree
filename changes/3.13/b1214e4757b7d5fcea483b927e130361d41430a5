ocfs2: fix possible double free in ocfs2_write_begin_nolock

When ocfs2_write_cluster_by_desc() failed in ocfs2_write_begin_nolock()
because of ENOSPC, it goes to out_quota, freeing data_ac(meta_ac).  Then
it calls ocfs2_try_to_free_truncate_log() to free space.  If enough
space freed, it will try to write again.  Unfortunately, some error
happenes before ocfs2_lock_allocators(), it goes to out and free
data_ac(meta_ac) again.
