xen-netback: fix guest-receive-side array sizes

The sizes chosen for the metadata and grant_copy_op arrays on the guest
receive size are wrong;

- The meta array is needlessly twice the ring size, when we only ever
  consume a single array element per RX ring slot
- The grant_copy_op array is way too small. It's sized based on a bogus
  assumption: that at most two copy ops will be used per ring slot. This
  may have been true at some point in the past but it's clear from looking
  at start_new_rx_buffer() that a new ring slot is only consumed if a frag
  would overflow the current slot (plus some other conditions) so the actual
  limit is MAX_SKB_FRAGS grant_copy_ops per ring slot.

This patch fixes those two sizing issues and, because grant_copy_ops grows
so much, it pulls it out into a separate chunk of vmalloc()ed memory.
