mm/zswap: refactor the get/put routines

The refcount routine was not fit the kernel get/put semantic exactly,
There were too many judgement statements on refcount and it could be
minus.

This patch does the following:

 - move refcount judgement to zswap_entry_put() to hide resource free function.

 - add a new function zswap_entry_find_get(), so that callers can use
   easily in the following pattern:

     zswap_entry_find_get
     .../* do something */
     zswap_entry_put

 - to eliminate compile error, move some functions declaration

This patch is based on Minchan Kim <minchan@kernel.org> 's idea and suggestion.
