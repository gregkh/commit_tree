Btrfs: don't delete ordered roots from list during cleanup

During transaction cleanup after an abort we are just removing roots from the
ordered roots list which is incorrect.  We have a BUG_ON() to make sure that the
root is still part of the ordered roots list when we put our ordered extent
which we were tripping in this case.  So do like we do everywhere else and just
move it to the tail of the ordered roots list and allow the normal cleanup to
take care of stuff.  Thanks,
