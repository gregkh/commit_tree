ARM: OMAP1: Fix a bunch of GPIO related section warnings after initdata got corrected

Commit f8e7ba66 (ARM: OMAP1: fix incorrect placement of
__initdata tag) fixed things but we started seeing section
warnings. Looks like I missed those in my automatic
build scripts:

Section mismatch in reference from the variable omap7xx_gpio6 to the (unknown reference) .init.data:(unknown)
Section mismatch in reference from the variable omap7xx_gpio6 to the (unknown reference) .init.data:(unknown)
Section mismatch in reference from the variable omap7xx_gpio5 to the (unknown reference) .init.data:(unknown)
...

Fix the issue by removing __initdata for the resources.
