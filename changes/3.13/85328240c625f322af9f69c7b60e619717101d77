net: allow netdev_all_upper_get_next_dev_rcu with rtnl lock held

It is useful to be able to walk all upper devices when bringing
a device online where the RTNL lock is held. In this case it
is safe to walk the all_adj_list because the RTNL lock is used
to protect the write side as well.

This patch adds a check to see if the rtnl lock is held before
throwing a warning in netdev_all_upper_get_next_dev_rcu().

Also because we now have a call site for lockdep_rtnl_is_held()
outside COFIG_LOCK_PROVING an inline definition returning 1 is
needed. Similar to the rcu_read_lock_is_held().
