genetlink: only pass array to genl_register_family_with_ops()

As suggested by David Miller, make genl_register_family_with_ops()
a macro and pass only the array, evaluating ARRAY_SIZE() in the
macro, this is a little safer.

The openvswitch has some indirection, assing ops/n_ops directly in
that code. This might ultimately just assign the pointers in the
family initializations, saving the struct genl_family_and_ops and
code (once mcast groups are handled differently.)
