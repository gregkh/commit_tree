xfs: vectorise directory leaf operations

Next step in the vectorisation process is the leaf block
encode/decode operations. Most of the operations on leaves are
handled by the data block vectors, so there are relatively few of
them here.

Because of all the shuffling of code and having to pass more state
to some functions, this patch doesn't directly reduce the size of
the binary. It does open up many more opportunities for factoring
and optimisation, however.
