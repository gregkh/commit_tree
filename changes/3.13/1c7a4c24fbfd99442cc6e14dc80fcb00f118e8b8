NFC Digital: Add target NFC-DEP support

This adds support for NFC-DEP target mode for NFC-A and NFC-F
technologies.

If the driver provides it, the stack uses an automatic mode for
technology detection and automatic anti-collision. Otherwise the stack
tries to use non-automatic synchronization and listens for SENS_REQ and
SENSF_REQ commands.

The detection, activation, and data exchange procedures work exactly
the same way as in initiator mode, as described in the previous
commits, except that the digital stack waits for commands and sends
responses back to the peer device.
