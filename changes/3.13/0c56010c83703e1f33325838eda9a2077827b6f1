null_blk: mem garbage on NUMA systems during init

For NUMA systems, initializing the blk-mq layer and using per node hctx.
We initialize submit queues to 1, while blk-mq nr_hw_queues is
initialized to the number of NUMA nodes.

This makes the null_init_hctx function overwrite memory outside of what
it allocated.  In my case it lead to writing garbage into struct
request_queue's mq_map.
