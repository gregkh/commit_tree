Btrfs: make sure to copy everything if we rename

If we rename a file that is already in the log and we fsync again we will lose
the new name.  This is because we just log the inode update and not the new ref.
To fix this we just need to check if we are logging the new name of the inode
and copy all the metadata instead of just updating the inode itself.  With this
patch my testcase now passes.  Thanks,
