[SCSI] esas2r: Directly call kernel functions for atomic bit operations

Previously the code embedded the kernel's test_bit/clear_bit
functions in wrappers that accepted u32 parameters.  The
wrapper cast these parameters to longs before passing them
to the kernel's bit functions.   This did not work properly
on platforms with 64-bit longs.
