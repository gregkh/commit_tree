mm: hugetlbfs: fix hugetlbfs optimization

Commit 7cb2ef56e6a8 ("mm: fix aio performance regression for database
caused by THP") can cause dereference of a dangling pointer if
split_huge_page runs during PageHuge() if there are updates to the
tail_page->private field.

Also it is repeating compound_head twice for hugetlbfs and it is running
compound_head+compound_trans_head for THP when a single one is needed in
both cases.

The new code within the PageSlab() check doesn't need to verify that the
THP page size is never bigger than the smallest hugetlbfs page size, to
avoid memory corruption.

A longstanding theoretical race condition was found while fixing the
above (see the change right after the skip_unlock label, that is
relevant for the compound_lock path too).

By re-establishing the _mapcount tail refcounting for all compound
pages, this also fixes the below problem:

  echo 0 >/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
