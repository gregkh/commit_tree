drm: don't double-free on driver load error

All instances of drm_dev_register are followed by drm_dev_free on
failure. Don't free dev->control/render/primary on failure, as they will
be freed by drm_dev_free since commit 8f6599da8e (drm: delay minor
destruction to drm_dev_free()). Instead unplug them.
