bnx2x: Prevent panic during DMAE timeout

If chip enters a recovery flow just after the driver issues a DMAE request
the DMAE will timeout. Current code will cause a bnx2x_panic() as a result,
which means interface will no longer be usable (regardless of the recovery
results), as bnx2x_panic() is irreversible for the driver.

As this is a possible flow, the panic should be reached only when driver
is compiled with STOP_ON_ERROR.
