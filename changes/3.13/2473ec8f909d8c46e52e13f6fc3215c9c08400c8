wlcore: wakeup from ELP before starting recovery

Make sure the FW is awake when entering recovery. This is useful for
reading the FW panic log and also some FW registers giving us crash
report stats.

We must do this before interrupts are disabled since we rely on an
interrupt to complete the wakeup.

If the wakeup fails, continue recovery normally. All read/writes will be
blocked and won't do any harm.
