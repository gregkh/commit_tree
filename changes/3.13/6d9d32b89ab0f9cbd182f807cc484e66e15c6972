iwlwifi: mvm: keep connection to AP after WoWLAN

Until now, after WoWLAN, we weren't able to keep the
connection to the AP because the firmware didn't give
us the right information. Since the firmware API has
been changed to include all the information we need,
change the driver to work with the new API (if it is
available) and program all the relevant information
in mac80211 to keep the connection.
