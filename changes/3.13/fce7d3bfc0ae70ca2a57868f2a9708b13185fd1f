x86/efi: Don't select EFI from certain special ACPI drivers

Commit 7ea6c6c1 ("Move cper.c from drivers/acpi/apei to
drivers/firmware/efi") results in CONFIG_EFI being enabled even
when the user doesn't want this. Since ACPI APEI used to build
fine without UEFI (and as far as I know also has no functional
depency on it), at least in that case using a reverse dependency
is wrong (and a straight one isn't needed).

Whether the same is true for ACPI_EXTLOG I don't know - if there
is a functional dependency, it should depend on EFI rather than
selecting it. It certainly has (currently) no build dependency.

Adjust Kconfig and build logic so that the bad dependency gets
avoided.
