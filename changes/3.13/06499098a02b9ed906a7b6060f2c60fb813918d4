bridge: pass correct vlan id to multicast code

Currently multicast code attempts to extrace the vlan id from
the skb even when vlan filtering is disabled.  This can lead
to mdb entries being created with the wrong vlan id.
Pass the already extracted vlan id to the multicast
filtering code to make the correct id is used in
creation as well as lookup.
