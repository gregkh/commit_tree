drm/radeon: fix render backend setup for SI and CIK

Only the render backends of the first shader engine were enabled. The others
were erroneously disabled. Enabling the other render backends improves
performance a lot.

Unigine Sanctuary on Bonaire:
  Before: 15 fps
  After:  90 fps

Judging from the fan noise, the GPU was also underclocked when the other
render backends were disabled, resulting in horrible performance. The fan is
a lot noisy under load now.
