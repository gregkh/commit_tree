gpiolib: export descriptor-based GPIO interface

This patch exports the gpiod_* family of API functions, a safer
alternative to the legacy GPIO interface. Differences between the gpiod
and legacy gpio APIs are:

- gpio works with integers, whereas gpiod operates on opaque handlers
  which cannot be forged or used before proper acquisition
- gpiod get/set functions are aware of the active low state of a GPIO
- gpio consumers should now include <linux/gpio/consumer.h> to access
  the new interface, whereas chips drivers will use
  <linux/gpio/driver.h>

The legacy gpio API is now built as inline functions on top of gpiod.
