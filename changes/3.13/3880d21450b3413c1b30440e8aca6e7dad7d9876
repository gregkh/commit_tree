drivers: cpuidle: rename ARM big.LITTLE driver config and makefile entries

Following the reorganization of CPU idle drivers configurations into an ARM
specific Kconfig, the existing idle drivers Kconfig entries were renamed and
moved to the Kconfig.arm file. Makefile entries were updated accordingly.

This patch renames the entries in Kconfig.arm and makefile to make the newly
added big.LITTLE CPUidle driver compliant with the new naming convention.
