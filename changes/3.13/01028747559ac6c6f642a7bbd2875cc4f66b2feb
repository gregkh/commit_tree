sched: Create more preempt_count accessors

We need a few special preempt_count accessors:
 - task_preempt_count() for when we're interested in the preemption
   count of another (non-running) task.
 - init_task_preempt_count() for properly initializing the preemption
   count.
 - init_idle_preempt_count() a special case of the above for the idle
   threads.

With these no generic code ever touches thread_info::preempt_count
anymore and architectures could choose to remove it.
