tools/vm/page-types.c: support KPF_SOFTDIRTY bit

Soft dirty bit allows us to track which pages are written since the last
clear_ref (by "echo 4 > /proc/pid/clear_refs".) This is useful for
userspace applications to know their memory footprints.

Note that the kernel exposes this flag via bit[55] of /proc/pid/pagemap,
and the semantics is not a default one (scheduled to be the default in the
near future.) However, it shifts to the new semantics at the first
clear_ref, and the users of soft dirty bit always do it before utilizing
the bit, so that's not a big deal.  Users must avoid relying on the bit in
page-types before the first clear_ref.
