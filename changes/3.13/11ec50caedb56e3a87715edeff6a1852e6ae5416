word-at-a-time: provide generic big-endian zero_bytemask implementation

Whilst architectures may be able to do better than this (which they can,
by simply defining their own macro), this is a generic stab at a
zero_bytemask implementation for the asm-generic, big-endian
word-at-a-time implementation.

On arm64, a clz instruction is used to implement the fls efficiently.
