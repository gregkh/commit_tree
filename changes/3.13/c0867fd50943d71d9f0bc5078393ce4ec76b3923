KVM: PPC: Book3S: Add GET/SET_ONE_REG interface for VRSAVE

The VRSAVE register value for a vcpu is accessible through the
GET/SET_SREGS interface for Book E processors, but not for Book 3S
processors.  In order to make this accessible for Book 3S processors,
this adds a new register identifier for GET/SET_ONE_REG, and adds
the code to implement it.
