sched_clock: Use seqcount instead of rolling our own

We're going to increase the cyc value to 64 bits in the near
future. Doing that is going to break the custom seqcount
implementation in the sched_clock code because 64 bit numbers
aren't guaranteed to be atomic. Replace the cyc_copy with a
seqcount to avoid this problem.
