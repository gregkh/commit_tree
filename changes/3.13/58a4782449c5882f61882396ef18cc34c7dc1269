ipv6: sit: update mtu check to take care of gso packets

While testing my changes for TSO support in SIT devices,
I was using sit0 tunnel which appears to include nopmtudisc flag.

But using :

ip tun add sittun mode sit remote $REMOTE_IPV4 local $LOCAL_IPV4 \
   dev $IFACE

We get a tunnel which rejects too long packets because of the mtu check
which is not yet GSO aware.

erd:~# ip tunnel
sittun: ipv6/ip  remote 10.246.17.84  local 10.246.17.83  ttl inherit  6rd-prefix 2002::/16
sit0: ipv6/ip  remote any  local any  ttl 64  nopmtudisc 6rd-prefix 2002::/16

This patch is based on an excellent report from
Michal Shmidt.

In the future, we probably want to extend the MTU check to do the
right thing for GSO packets...
