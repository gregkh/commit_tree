powerpc: Add ability to build little endian kernels

This patch allows the kbuild system to successfully compile a kernel
for the little endian PowerPC64 architecture. A subsequent patch
will add the CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN kernel config option which
must be set to build such a kernel.

If cross compiling, CROSS_COMPILE must point to a suitable toolchain
(compiled for the powerpc64le-linux and powerpcle-linux targets).
