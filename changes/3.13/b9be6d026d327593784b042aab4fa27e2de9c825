tracing: Show more exact help information about snapshot

The current "help" that comes out of the snapshot file when it is
not allocated looks like this:

 # * Snapshot is freed *
 #
 # Snapshot commands:
 # echo 0 > snapshot : Clears and frees snapshot buffer
 # echo 1 > snapshot : Allocates snapshot buffer, if not already allocated.
 #                      Takes a snapshot of the main buffer.
 # echo 2 > snapshot : Clears snapshot buffer (but does not allocate)
 #                      (Doesn't have to be '2' works with any number that
 #                       is not a '0' or '1')

Echo 2 says that it does not allocate the buffer, which is correct,
but to be more consistent with "echo 0" it should also state
that it does not free.
