ARM: 7794/1: block: Rename parameter dma_mask to max_addr for blk_queue_bounce_limit()

The blk_queue_bounce_limit() API parameter 'dma_mask' is actually the
maximum address the device can handle rather than a dma_mask. Rename
it accordingly to avoid it being interpreted as dma_mask.

No functional change.

The idea is to fix the bad assumptions about dma_mask wherever it could
be miss-interpreted.
