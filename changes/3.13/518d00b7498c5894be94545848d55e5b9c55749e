block: null_blk: fix queue leak inside removing device

When queue_mode is NULL_Q_MQ and null_blk is being removed,
blk_cleanup_queue() isn't called to cleanup queue, so the queue
allocated won't be freed.

This patch calls blk_cleanup_queue() for MQ to drain all pending
requests first and release the reference counter of queue kobject, then
blk_mq_free_queue() will be called in queue kobject's release handler
when queue kobject's reference counter drops to zero.
