Btrfs: fix btrfs_prev_leaf() previous key computation

If we decrement the key type, we must reset its offset to the largest
possible offset (u64)-1. If we decrement the key's objectid, then we
must reset the key's type and offset to their largest possible values,
(u8)-1 and (u64)-1 respectively. Not doing so can make us miss an
items in the tree.
