NFC: NCI: Simplify NCI SPI to become a simple framing/checking layer

NCI SPI layer should not manage the nci dev, this is the job of the nci
chipset driver. This layer should be limited to frame/deframe nci
packets, and optionnaly check integrity (crc) and manage the ack/nak
protocol.

The NCI SPI must not be mixed up with an NCI dev. spi_[dev|device] are
therefore renamed to a simple spi for more clarity.
The header and crc sizes are moved to nci.h so that drivers can use
them to reserve space in outgoing skbs.
nci_spi_send() is exported to be accessible by drivers.
