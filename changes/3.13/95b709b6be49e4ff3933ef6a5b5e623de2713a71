random: drop trickle mode

The add_timer_randomness() used to drop into trickle mode when entropy
pool was estimated to be 87.5% full.  This was important when
add_timer_randomness() was used to sample interrupts.  It's not used
for this any more --- add_interrupt_randomness() now uses fast_mix()
instead.  By elimitating trickle mode, it allows us to fully utilize
entropy provided by add_input_randomness() and add_disk_randomness()
even when the input pool is above the old trickle threshold of 87.5%.

This helps to answer the criticism in [1] in their hypothetical
scenario where our entropy estimator was inaccurate, even though the
measurements in [2] seem to indicate that our entropy estimator given
real-life entropy collection is actually pretty good, albeit on the
conservative side (which was as it was designed).
