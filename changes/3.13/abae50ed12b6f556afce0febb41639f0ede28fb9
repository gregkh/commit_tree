drm/i915: Do the fbc vs. primary plane enable/disable in the right order

Disable fbc before disabling the primary plane, and enable fbc after
the primary plane has been enabled again.

Also use intel_disable_fbc() to disable FBC to avoid the pointless
overhead of intel_update_fbc(), and especially avoid having to clean
up and set up the stolen mem compressed buffer again.
