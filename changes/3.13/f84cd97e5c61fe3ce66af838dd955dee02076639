s390/percpu: make use of interlocked-access facility 1 instructions

Optimize this_cpu_* functions for 64 bit by making use of new instructions
that came with the interlocked-access facility 1 (load-and-*) and the
general-instructions-extension facility (asi, agsi).
That way we get rid of the compare-and-swap loop in most cases.
Code size reduction (defconfig, -march=z196): 11,555 bytes.
