cpuidle: reduce code duplication inside cpuidle_idle_call()

We are doing this twice in cpuidle_idle_call() routine:
	drv->states[next_state].flags & CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP

Would be better if we actually store this in a local variable and
use that. That reduces code duplication and likely makes this piece
of code run faster (in case the compiler wasn't able to optimize it
earlier)
