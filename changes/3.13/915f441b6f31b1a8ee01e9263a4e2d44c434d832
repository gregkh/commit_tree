regmap: Provide asynchronous write and update bits operations

Make it easier for drivers to include single register writes in
asynchronous sequences by providing async versions of the write
and update bits operations. The update bits operations are only
likely to be effective when used with devices that have caches
but this is common enough to be useful.
