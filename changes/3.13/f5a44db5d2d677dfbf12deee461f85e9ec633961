ext4: add explicit casts when masking cluster sizes

The missing casts can cause the high 64-bits of the physical blocks to
be lost.  Set up new macros which allows us to make sure the right
thing happen, even if at some point we end up supporting larger
logical block numbers.

Thanks to the Emese Revfy and the PaX security team for reporting this
issue.
