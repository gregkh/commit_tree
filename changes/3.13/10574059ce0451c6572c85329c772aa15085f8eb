xen-netback: napi: fix abuse of budget

netback seems to be somewhat confused about the napi budget parameter. The
parameter is supposed to limit the number of skbs processed in each poll,
but netback has this confused with grant operations.

This patch fixes that, properly limiting the work done in each poll. Note
that this limit makes sure we do not process any more data from the shared
ring than we intend to pass back from the poll. This is important to
prevent tx_queue potentially growing without bound.
