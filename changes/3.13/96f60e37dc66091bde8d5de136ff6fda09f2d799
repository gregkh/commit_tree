DRM: Armada: Add Armada DRM driver

This patch adds support for the pair of LCD controllers on the Marvell
Armada 510 SoCs.  This driver supports:
- multiple contiguous scanout buffers for video and graphics
- shm backed cacheable buffer objects for X pixmaps for Vivante GPU
  acceleration
- dual lcd0 and lcd1 crt operation
- video overlay on each LCD crt via DRM planes
- page flipping of the main scanout buffers
- DRM prime for buffer export/import

This driver is trivial to extend to other Armada SoCs.

Included in this commit is the core driver with no output support; output
support is platform and encoder driver dependent.
