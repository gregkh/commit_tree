MIPS: Print correct PC in trace dump after NMI exception

An NMI exception delivered from YAMON delivers the PC in ErrorPC
instead of EPC. It's also necessary to clear the Status.BEV
bit for the page fault exception handler to work properly.

[ralf@linux-mips: Let the assembler do the loading of the mask value rather
than the convoluted explicit %hi/%lo manual relocation sequence from the
original patch.]
