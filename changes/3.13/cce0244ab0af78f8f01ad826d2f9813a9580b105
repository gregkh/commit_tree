cifs: change ERRnomem error mapping from ENOMEM to EREMOTEIO

Sometimes, the server will report an error that basically indicates
that it's running out of resources. These include these under SMB1:

NT_STATUS_NO_MEMORY
NT_STATUS_SECTION_TOO_BIG
NT_STATUS_TOO_MANY_PAGING_FILES

...and this one under SMB2:

STATUS_NO_MEMORY

Currently, this gets mapped to ENOMEM by the client, but that's
confusing as an ENOMEM error is typically an indicator that the
client is out of memory.

Change these errors to instead map to EREMOTEIO to indicate that
the problem is actually server-side and not on the client.
