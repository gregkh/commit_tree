dell-laptop: Sync current block state to BIOS on hw switch change

This is necessary for 3 reasons:
1) To apply sw_state changes made while hw-blocked
2) To set all the blocked bits for hw-switch controlled radios to 1 when the
   switch gets changed to off, this is necessary on some models to actually
   turn the radio status LEDs off.
3) On some models non hw-switch controlled radios will have their block bit
   cleared (potentially undoing a soft-block) on hw-switch toggle, this
   restores the sw-block in this case.
