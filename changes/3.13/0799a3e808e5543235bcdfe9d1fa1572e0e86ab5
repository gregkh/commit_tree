xfs: get rid of count from xfs_iomap_write_allocate()

Get rid of function variable count from xfs_iomap_write_allocate() as
it is unused.

Additionally, checkpatch warn me of the following for this change:
WARNING: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
+extern int xfs_iomap_write_allocate(struct xfs_inode *, xfs_off_t,

So this patch also remove all extern function prototypes at xfs_iomap.h
to suppress it to make this code style in consistent manner in this file.
