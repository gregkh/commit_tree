clocksource: Fix 'ret' data type of sysfs_override_clocksource() and sysfs_unbind_clocksource()

sysfs_override_clocksource(): The expression 'if (ret >= 0)' is always true.
This will cause clocksource_select() to always run.
Thus modified ret to be of type ssize_t.

sysfs_unbind_clocksource(): The expression 'if (ret < 0)' is always false.
So in case sysfs_get_uname() failed, the expression won't take an effect.
Thus modified ret to be of type ssize_t.
