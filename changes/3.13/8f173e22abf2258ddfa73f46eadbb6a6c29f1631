USB: serial: option: blacklist interface 1 for Huawei E173s-6

Interface 1 on this device isn't for option to bind to otherwise an oops
on usb_wwan with log flooding will happen when accessing the port:

tty_release: ttyUSB1: read/write wait queue active!

It doesn't seem to respond to QMI if it's added to qmi_wwan so don't add
it there - it's likely used by the card reader.
