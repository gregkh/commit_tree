sched/numa: Favor placing a task on the preferred node

A tasks preferred node is selected based on the number of faults
recorded for a node but the actual task_numa_migate() conducts a global
search regardless of the preferred nid. This patch checks if the
preferred nid has capacity and if so, searches for a CPU within that
node. This avoids a global search when the preferred node is not
overloaded.
