drm/i915/vlv: hack to init backlight regs if BIOS fails to do so v2

Still digging up the actual VBT info for this, but wanted to get this
out there for testing, or in case others are also bugged by this.

This can happen if you boot with an external display connected.  In that
case, the attached eDP backlight modulation frequency may not be
programmed, so we need to use something (in this case the value my BIOS
normally programs with just the internal display enabled).
