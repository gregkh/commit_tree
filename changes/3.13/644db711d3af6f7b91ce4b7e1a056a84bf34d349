drm/i915: dump crtc timings from the pipe config

I always get royally confused how a modeline with all zeros could
possible pass the paranoid pipe config checker. Until I realize again
that we only check the crtc timings. So dump the crtc timings for the
adjusted mode.

This will be even more important for 3D support where the crtc timings
are markedly different from the input modeline if we have
frame-by-frame 3d output enabled.
