NFS: Migration support for RELEASE_LOCKOWNER

Currently the Linux NFS client ignores the operation status code for
the RELEASE_LOCKOWNER operation.  Like NFSv3's UMNT operation,
RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is a courtesy to help servers manage their
resources, and the outcome is not consequential for the client.

During a migration, a server may report NFS4ERR_LEASE_MOVED, in
which case the client really should retry, since typically
LEASE_MOVED has nothing to do with the current operation, but does
prevent it from going forward.

Also, it's important for a client to respond as soon as possible to
a moved lease condition, since the client's lease could expire on
the destination without further action by the client.

NFS4ERR_DELAY is not included in the list of valid status codes for
RELEASE_LOCKOWNER in RFC 3530bis.  However, rfc3530-migration-update
does permit migration-capable servers to return DELAY to clients,
but only in the context of an ongoing migration.  In this case the
server has frozen lock state in preparation for migration, and a
client retry would help the destination server purge unneeded state
once migration recovery is complete.

Interestly, NFS4ERR_MOVED is not valid for RELEASE_LOCKOWNER, even
though lock owners can be migrated with Transparent State Migration.

Note that RFC 3530bis section 9.5 includes RELEASE_LOCKOWNER in the
list of operations that renew a client's lease on the server if they
succeed.  Now that our client pays attention to the operation's
status code, we can note that renewal appropriately.
