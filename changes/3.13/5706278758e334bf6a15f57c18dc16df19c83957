xfs: unify directory/attribute format definitions

The on-disk format definitions for the directory and attribute
structures are spread across 3 header files right now, only one of
which is dedicated to defining on-disk structures and their
manipulation (xfs_dir2_format.h). Pull all the format definitions
into a single header file - xfs_da_format.h - and switch all the
code over to point at that.
