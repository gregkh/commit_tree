IPoIB: Start multicast join process only on active ports

The driver starts the mcast_join task whenever the netdev interface is
UP without relation to the underlying IB port state.

Until the port state is ACTIVE all the join requests are irrelevant,
and the IB core returns -EINVAL. So the user will see errors such as:
"multicast join failed for ff12:401b:... , status -22".

Instead, have ipoib_mcast_join_task() return when the port is not active.

It will be called again when the port state is changed and the
low-level driver triggers the IB_EVENT_PORT_ACTIVE event or the
IB_EVENT_CLIENT_REREGISTER event.
