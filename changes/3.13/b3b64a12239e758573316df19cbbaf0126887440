tools/perf/build: Improve printout-of auto-detected features

Change the print-out of auto-detected features by making sure that
repeat invocations of 'make' when all features are successfully
detected do not produce the (rather lengthy) autodetection printout.

( When one or more features are missing then we still print out the
  feature detection table, to make sure people are aware of the
  resulting limitations. )
