mei: revamp read and write length checks

1. Return zero on zero length read and writes
2. For a too large write return -EFBIG as defined in man write(2)
EFBIG  An attempt was made to write a file that
        exceeds the implementation-defined maximum
        file size or the process's file size limit,
        or to  write  at  a  position  past  the  maximum
        allowed offset.
