clk: ux500: fix erroneous bit assignment

Due to a typo or similar, the peripheral group 2 clock 11
gate was set to bit 1 instead of bit 11. We need to fix this
to be able to set the correct enable bit in the device tree:
when trying to correct the bit assignment in the device tree,
the system would hang.
