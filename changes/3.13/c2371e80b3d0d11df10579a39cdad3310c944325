Bluetooth: Fix error handling for HCI socket options

The HCI sockets for monitor and control do not support any HCI specific
socket options and if tried, an error will be returned. However the
error used is EINVAL and that is not really descriptive. To make it
clear that these sockets are not handling HCI socket options, return
EBADFD instead.
