GFS2: Fix use-after-free race when calling gfs2_remove_from_ail

Function gfs2_remove_from_ail drops the reference on the bh via
brelse. This patch fixes a race condition whereby bh is deferenced
after the brelse when setting bd->bd_blkno = bh->b_blocknr;
Under certain rare circumstances, bh might be gone or reused,
and bd->bd_blkno is set to whatever that memory happens to be,
which is often 0. Later, in gfs2_trans_add_unrevoke, that bd fails
the test "bd->bd_blkno >= blkno" which causes it to never be freed.
The end result is that the bd is never freed from the bufdata cache,
which results in this error:
slab error in kmem_cache_destroy(): cache `gfs2_bufdata': Can't free all objects
