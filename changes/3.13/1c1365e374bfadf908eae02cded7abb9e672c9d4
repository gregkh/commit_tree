sysfs: return correct error code on unimplemented mmap()

Both POSIX.1-2008 and Linux Programmer's Manual have a dedicated return
error code for a case, when a file doesn't support mmap(), it's ENODEV.

This change replaces overloaded EINVAL with ENODEV in a situation
described above for sysfs binary files.
