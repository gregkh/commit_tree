mm: kmemleak: avoid false negatives on vmalloc'ed objects

Commit 248ac0e1943a ("mm/vmalloc: remove guard page from between vmap
blocks") had the side effect of making vmap_area.va_end member point to
the next vmap_area.va_start.  This was creating an artificial reference
to vmalloc'ed objects and kmemleak was rarely reporting vmalloc() leaks.

This patch marks the vmap_area containing pointers explicitly and
reduces the min ref_count to 2 as vm_struct still contains a reference
to the vmalloc'ed object.  The kmemleak add_scan_area() function has
been improved to allow a SIZE_MAX argument covering the rest of the
object (for simpler calling sites).
