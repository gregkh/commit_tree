Bluetooth: Fix potential double-frees of L2CAP skbs

The l2cap_recv_frame function is expected to take ownership and
eventually free the skb passed to it. We need to ensure that the
conn->rx_skb pointer is no longer reachable when calling
l2cap_recv_frame so that no other function, such as l2cap_conn_del, may
think that it can free conn->rx_skb.

An actual situation when this can happen is when smp_sig_channel (called
from l2cap_recv_frame) fails and l2cap_conn_del gets called as a
consequence. The l2cap_conn_del function would then try to free
conn->rx_skb, but as the same skb was just passed to smp_sig_channel and
freed we get a double-free.
