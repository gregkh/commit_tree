mm: place page->pmd_huge_pte to right union

I don't know what went wrong, mis-merge or something, but ->pmd_huge_pte
placed in wrong union within struct page.

In original patch[1] it's placed to union with ->lru and ->slab, but in
commit e009bb30c8df ("mm: implement split page table lock for PMD
level") it's in union with ->index and ->freelist.

That union seems also unused for pages with table tables and safe to
re-use, but it's not what I've tested.

Let's move it to original place.  It fixes indentation at least.  :)
