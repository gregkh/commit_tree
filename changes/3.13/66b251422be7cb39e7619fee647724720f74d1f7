random32: add __init prefix to prandom_start_seed_timer

We only call that in functions annotated with __init, so add __init
prefix in prandom_start_seed_timer() as well, so that the kernel can
make use of this hint and we can possibly free up resources after it's
usage. And since it's an internal function rename it to
__prandom_start_seed_timer().
