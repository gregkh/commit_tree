ARM: dts: omap4-panda-common: Fix pin muxing for wl12xx

pin mux wl12xx_gpio and wl12xx_pins should be part of omap4_pmx_core
and not omap4_pmx_wkup. So, move wl12xx_* to omap4_pmx_core.

Fix the following error message:
pinctrl-single 4a31e040.pinmux: mux offset out of range: 0x38 (0x38)
pinctrl-single 4a31e040.pinmux: could not add functions for pinmux_wl12xx_pins 56x

SDIO card is not detected after moving pin mux to omap4_pmx_core since
sdmmc5_clk pull is disabled. Enable Pull up on sdmmc5_clk to detect SDIO card.

This fixes a regression where WLAN did not work after a warm reset
or after one up/down cycle that happened when we move omap4 to boot
using device tree only. For reference, the kernel bug is described at:
