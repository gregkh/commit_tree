i40e: Do not directly increment Tx next_to_use

Avoid directly incrementing next_to_use for multiple reasons.  The main
reason being that if we directly increment it then it can attain a state
where it is equal to the ring count.  Technically this is a state it
should not be able to reach but the way this is written it now can.

This patch pulls the value off into a register and then increments it
and writes back either the value or 0 depending on if the value is equal
to the ring count.
