checkpatch: update seq_<foo> tests

seq_vprintf, seq_printf and seq_puts are logging functions and should be
allowed to exceed the maximium line length.

Add maximum line length exceptions for these functions.

Also, suggesting seq_printf conversions to seq_puts should be tested for
arguments after the format.
