wlcore: clarify and fix regulatory domain bit translation

Channels 52-64 were mapped incorrectly.

Refactor and document wlcore_get_reg_conf_ch_idx() in
order to make it clear what's going on there.

While on it, fix the return value check to consider
0 as a valid return value as well (indicates channel 1).
