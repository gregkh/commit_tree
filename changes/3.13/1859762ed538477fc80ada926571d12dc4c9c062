HID:hid-lg4ff: Correct Auto-center strength for wheels other than MOMO and MOMO2

The MOMO and MOMO2 wheels have a slightly different autocenter command,
and accept values in the range 0..F (rather than 0..7 for the other wheels).

This patch uses the product ID to determine how to compute the strength.
