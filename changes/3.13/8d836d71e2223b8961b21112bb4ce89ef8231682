Bluetooth: Access sk_sndtimeo indirectly in l2cap_core.c

As part of the work to remove struct sock from l2cap_core.c and make it
more generic we remove in this commit the direct access to sk->sk_sndtimeo
member. This objective of this change is purely remove sk usage from
l2cap_core.c

Now we have a new l2cap ops to get the current value of sk->sndtimeo. A
l2cap_chan_no_get_sndtimeo was added for users of L2CAP that doesn't need
to set a timeout.
