drm/i915: Add support for pipe_bpp readout

On CTG+ read out the pipe bpp setting from hardware and fill it into
pipe config. Also check it appropriately.

v2: Don't do the pipe_bpp extraction inside the PCH only code block on
    ILK+.
    Avoid the PIPECONF read as we already have read it for the
    PIPECONF_EANBLE check.
