ipv6: drop the judgement in rt6_alloc_cow()

Now rt6_alloc_cow() is only called by ip6_pol_route() when
rt->rt6i_flags doesn't contain both RTF_NONEXTHOP and RTF_GATEWAY,
and rt->rt6i_flags hasn't been changed in ip6_rt_copy().
So there is no neccessary to judge whether rt->rt6i_flags contains
RTF_GATEWAY or not.
