KVM: ARM: Get rid of KVM_HPAGE defines

The KVM_HPAGE_DEFINES are a little artificial on ARM, since the huge
page size is statically defined at compile time and there is only a
single huge page size.

Now when the main kvm code relying on these defines has been moved to
the x86 specific part of the world, we can get rid of these.
