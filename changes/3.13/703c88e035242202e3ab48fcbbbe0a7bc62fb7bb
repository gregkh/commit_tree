Btrfs: fix tracking of orphan inode count

In inode.c:btrfs_orphan_add() if we failed to insert the orphan
item, we would return without decrementing the orphan count that
we just incremented before attempting the insertion, leaving the
orphan inode count wrong.

In inode.c:btrfs_orphan_del(), we were decrementing the inode
orphan count if the bit BTRFS_INODE_ORPHAN_META_RESERVED was set,
which is logically wrong because it should be decremented if the
bit BTRFS_INODE_HAS_ORPHAN_ITEM was set - after all we increment
the count when we set the bit BTRFS_INODE_HAS_ORPHAN_ITEM elsewhere.
