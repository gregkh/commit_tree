virt/kvm/iommu.c: Add leading zeros to device's BDF notation in debug messages

When KVM (de)assigns PCI(e) devices to VMs, a debug message is printed
including the BDF notation of the respective device. Currently, the BDF
notation does not have the commonly used leading zeros. This produces
messages like "assign device 0:1:8.0", which look strange at first sight.

The patch fixes this by exchanging the printk(KERN_DEBUG ...) with dev_info()
and also inserts "kvm" into the debug message, so that it is obvious where
the message comes from. Also reduces LoC.
