arm/arm64: KVM: PSCI: use MPIDR to identify a target CPU

The KVM PSCI code blindly assumes that vcpu_id and MPIDR are
the same thing. This is true when vcpus are organized as a flat
topology, but is wrong when trying to emulate any other topology
(such as A15 clusters).

Change the KVM PSCI CPU_ON code to look at the MPIDR instead
of the vcpu_id to pick a target CPU.
