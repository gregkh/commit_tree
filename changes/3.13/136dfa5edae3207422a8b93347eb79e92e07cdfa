ARM: delete mach-shark

The Shark machine sub-architecture (also known as DNARD, the
DIGITAL Network Appliance Reference Design) lacks a maintainer
able to apply and test patches to modernize the architecture.

It is suspected that the current kernel, while it compiles,
does not even boot on this machine. The listed maintainer has
expressed that he will not be able to spend any time on the
maintenance for the coming year.

So let's delete it from the kernel for now. It can always be
resurrected with git revert if maintenance is resumed.

As the VIA82c505 PCI adapter was only used by this
architecture, that gets deleted too.
