tcp: metrics: Avoid duplicate entries with the same destination-IP

Because the tcp-metrics is an RCU-list, it may be that two
soft-interrupts are inside __tcp_get_metrics() for the same
destination-IP at the same time. If this destination-IP is not yet part of
the tcp-metrics, both soft-interrupts will end up in tcpm_new and create
a new entry for this IP.
So, we will have two tcp-metrics with the same destination-IP in the list.

This patch checks twice __tcp_get_metrics(). First without holding the
lock, then while holding the lock. The second one is there to confirm
that the entry has not been added by another soft-irq while waiting for
the spin-lock.

Fixes: 51c5d0c4b169b (tcp: Maintain dynamic metrics in local cache.)
