ARM: dts: OMAP5: Add CPU OPP table

Add DT OPP table for OMAP54xx family of devices. This data is
decoded by OF with of_init_opp_table() helper function.

The data is based on OMAP543x ES2.0 DM Operating Condition Addendum
Version 0.6(April 2013)

NOTE: The voltage and frequency values work well only on NOM samples
and are supposed to work properly only with ABB/AVS for ALL OPPs.

TODO: Add SPEED BIN OPP after ABB and AVS support so the cpufreq works
on all samples seamlessly. Clock node is pending alignment for clock
dts conversion
