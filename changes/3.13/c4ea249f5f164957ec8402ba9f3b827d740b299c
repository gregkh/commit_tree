Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP Disconnect response for unknown CID

If we receive an L2CAP Disconnect Request for an unknown CID we should
not just silently drop it but reply with a proper Command Reject
response. This patch fixes this by ensuring that the disconnect handler
returns a proper error instead of 0 and will cause the function caller
to send the right response.
