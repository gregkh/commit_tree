Bluetooth: Don't advertise high speed support without SSP

It is not allowed to enable high speed support when Secure Simple
Pairing is not available or disabled.

However the support for high speed gets advertised on a controller
that does not even support Secure Simple Pairing. Since there is
no way to enable high speed support on such a controller, do not
even advertise its support.
