sched/wait: Change timeout logic

Commit 4c663cf ("wait: fix false timeouts when using
wait_event_timeout()") introduced an additional condition check after
a timeout but there's a few issues;

 - it forgot one site
 - it put the check after the main loop; not at the actual timeout
   check.

Cure both; by wrapping the condition (as suggested by Oleg), this
avoids double evaluation of 'condition' which could be quite big.
