of: create unflatten_and_copy_device_tree

Several architectures using DT support built-in dtb's in the init
section. These platforms need to copy the dtb from init since the
strings are referenced after unflattening. Every arch has their own
copying routine which do the same thing. Create a common function,
unflatten_and_copy_device_tree, to copy the dtb when unflattening the
dtb.
