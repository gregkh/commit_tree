Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-at91 suspend"

This reverts commit 056ca85dab838bf064485b6cd73ddfcd9bf707e7.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
