Documentation: gpiolib: document new interface

gpiolib now exports a new descriptor-based interface which deprecates
the older integer-based one. This patch documents this new interface and
also takes the opportunity to brush-up the GPIO documentation a little
bit.

The new descriptor-based interface follows the same consumer/driver
model as many other kernel subsystems (e.g. clock, regulator), so its
documentation has similarly been splitted into different files.

The content of the former documentation has been reused whenever it
made sense; however, some of its content did not apply to the new
interface anymore and have this been removed. Likewise, new sections
like the mapping of GPIOs to devices have been written from scratch.

The deprecated legacy-based documentation is still available, untouched,
under Documentation/gpio/gpio-legacy.txt.
