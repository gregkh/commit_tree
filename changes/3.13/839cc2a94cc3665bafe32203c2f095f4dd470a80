seq_file: introduce seq_setwidth() and seq_pad()

There are several users who want to know bytes written by seq_*() for
alignment purpose.  Currently they are using %n format for knowing it
because seq_*() returns 0 on success.

This patch introduces seq_setwidth() and seq_pad() for allowing them to
align without using %n format.
