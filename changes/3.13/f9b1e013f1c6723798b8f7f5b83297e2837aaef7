video: exynos_dp: remove non-DT support for Exynos Display Port

Exynos Display Port can be used only for Exynos SoCs. In addition,
non-DT for EXYNOS SoCs is not supported from v3.11; thus, there is
no need to support non-DT for Exynos Display Port.

The 'include/video/exynos_dp.h' file has been used for non-DT
support and the content of file include/video/exynos_dp.h is moved
to drivers/video/exynos/exynos_dp_core.h. Thus, the 'exynos_dp.h'
file is removed. Also, 'struct exynos_dp_platdata' is removed,
because it is not used any more.
