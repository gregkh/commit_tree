ARM: 7876/1: clear Thumb-2 IT state on exception handling

The exception handling code fails to clear the IT state, potentially
leading to incorrect execution of the fixup if the size of the IT
block is more than one.

Let fixup_exception do the IT sanitizing if a fixup has been found,
and restore CPSR from the stack when returning from a data abort.
