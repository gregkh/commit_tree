net: cdc_ncm: remove redundant netdev field

Too many pointers back and forth are likely to confuse developers,
creating subtle bugs whenever we forget to syncronize them all.

As a usbnet driver, we should stick with the standard struct
usbnet fields as much as possible.  The netdevice is one such
field.
