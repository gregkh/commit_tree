powerpc: Fix up the kdump base cap to 128M

The current logic sets the kdump base to min of 2G or ppc64_rma_size/2.
On PowerNV kernel the first memory block 'memory@0' can be very large,
equal to the DIMM size with ppc64_rma_size value capped to 1G. Hence on
PowerNV, kdump base is set to 512M resulting kdump to fail while allocating
paca array. This is because, paca need its memory from RMA region capped
at 256M (see allocate_pacas()).

This patch lowers the kdump base cap to 128M so that kdump kernel can
successfully get memory below 256M for paca allocation.
