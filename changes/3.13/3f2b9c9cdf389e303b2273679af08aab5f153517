module: remove rmmod --wait option.

The option to wait for a module reference count to reach zero was in
the initial module implementation, but it was never supported in
modprobe (you had to use rmmod --wait).  After discussion with Lucas,
It has been deprecated (with a 10 second sleep) in kmod for the last
year.

This finally removes it: the flag will evoke a printk warning and a
normal (non-blocking) remove attempt.
