KVM: mmu: remove uninteresting MMU "free" callbacks

The free MMU callback has been a wrapper for mmu_free_roots since mmu_free_roots
itself was introduced (commit 17ac10a, [PATCH] KVM: MU: Special treatment
for shadow pae root pages, 2007-01-05), and has always been the same for all
MMU cases.  Remove the indirection as it is useless.
