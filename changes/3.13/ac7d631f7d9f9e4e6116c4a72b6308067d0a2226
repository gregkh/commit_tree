ioatdma: Fix bug in selftest after removal of DMA_MEMSET.

Commit 48a9db4 (3.11) removed the memset op in the xor selftest for ioatdma.
The issue is that with the removal of that op, it never replaced the memset
with a CPU memset. The memory being operated on is expected to be zeroes but
was not. This is causing the xor selftest to fail.
