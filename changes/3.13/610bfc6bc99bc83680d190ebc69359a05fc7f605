batman-adv: Receive fragmented packets and merge

Fragments arriving at their destination are buffered for later merge.
Merged packets are passed to the main receive function as had they never
been fragmented.

Fragments are forwarded without merging if the MTU of the outgoing
interface is smaller than the size of the merged packet.
