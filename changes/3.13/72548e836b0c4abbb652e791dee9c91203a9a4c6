x86/efi: Add EFI framebuffer earlyprintk support

It's incredibly difficult to diagnose early EFI boot issues without
special hardware because earlyprintk=vga doesn't work on EFI systems.

Add support for writing to the EFI framebuffer, via earlyprintk=efi,
which will actually give users a chance of providing debug output.
