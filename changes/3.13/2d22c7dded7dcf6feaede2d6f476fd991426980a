ath9k: Use correct PCIE initvals for AR9485

Currently, the PLL is turned off for AR9485 when
switching to a low power state, but AR9485 has an issue
where the card will become unresponsive if left idle
for a long time without any traffic. To fix this,
force the PLL to always be on using a different initval
array, ar9485_1_1_pll_on_cdr_on_clkreq_disable_L1.

This is done for most of the AR9485 based cards
like HB125, WB225 etc. but certain models require the
feature to be turned off. Identify such cards and use
default values for them.
