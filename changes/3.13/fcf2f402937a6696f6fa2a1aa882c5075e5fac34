s390/pci: obtain function handle in hotplug notifier

When using the CLP interface to enable or disable a pci device a
valid function handle needs to be delivered. So far our assumption
was that we always have an up-to-date version of the function handle
(since it doesn't change when the device is in use). This assumption
is incorrect if the pci device is enabled or disabled outside of our
control. When we are notified about such a change we already receive
the new function handle. Just use it.
