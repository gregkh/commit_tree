f2fs: account for orphan inodes during recovery

During recovery, orphan inodes are deleted via truncate_hole().
These orphans are added by recover_dentry() via f2fs_delete_entry().
However, f2fs_delete_entry() adds them via add_orphan_inode()
without calling acquire_orphan_inode() first.  This prevents the
counters from being incremented properly, which causes them to
underflow when remove_orphan_inode() is called later on.
