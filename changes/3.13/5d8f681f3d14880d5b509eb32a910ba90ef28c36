USB: EHCI: fix type mismatch in check_intr_schedule

This patch fixes a type mismatch in ehci-hcd caused by commit
b35c5009bbf6 (USB: EHCI: create per-TT bandwidth tables).  The c_maskp
parameter in check_intr_schedule() was changed to point to unsigned
int rather than __hc32, but the prototype declaration wasn't adjusted
accordingly.
