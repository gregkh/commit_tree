qlcnic: Fix resource allocation for TX queues

o TX queues allocation was getting distributed equally among all the
  functions of the port including VFs and PF. Which was leading to failure
  in PF's multiple TX queues creation.

o Instead of dividing queues equally allocate one TX queue for each VF as VF
  doesn't support multiple TX queues.
