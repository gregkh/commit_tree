audit: remove CONFIG_AUDIT_LOGINUID_IMMUTABLE

After trying to use this feature in Fedora we found the hard coding
policy like this into the kernel was a bad idea.  Surprise surprise.
We ran into these problems because it was impossible to launch a
container as a logged in user and run a login daemon inside that container.
This reverts back to the old behavior before this option was added.  The
option will be re-added in a userspace selectable manor such that
userspace can choose when it is and when it is not appropriate.
