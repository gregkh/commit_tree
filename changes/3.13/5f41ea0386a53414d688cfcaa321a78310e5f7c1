gcov: add support for gcc 4.7 gcov format

The gcov in-memory format changed in gcc 4.7.  The biggest change, which
requires this special implementation, is that gcov_info no longer contains
array of counters for each counter type for all functions and gcov_fn_info
is not used for mapping of function's counters to these arrays(offset).
Now each gcov_fn_info contans it's counters, which makes things a little
bit easier.

This is heavily based on the previous gcc_3_4.c implementation and patches
provided by Peter Oberparleiter.  Specially the buffer gcda implementation
for iterator.
