swiotlb-xen: use xen_alloc/free_coherent_pages

Use xen_alloc_coherent_pages and xen_free_coherent_pages to allocate or
free coherent pages.

We need to be careful handling the pointer returned by
xen_alloc_coherent_pages, because on ARM the pointer is not equal to
phys_to_virt(*dma_handle). In fact virt_to_phys only works for kernel
direct mapped RAM memory.
In ARM case the pointer could be an ioremap address, therefore passing
it to virt_to_phys would give you another physical address that doesn't
correspond to it.

Make xen_create_contiguous_region take a phys_addr_t as start parameter to
avoid the virt_to_phys calls which would be incorrect.

Changes in v6:
- remove extra spaces.
