ARM: at91: fix hanged boot due to early rtc-interrupt

Make sure the RTC-interrupts are masked at boot by adding a new helper
function to be used at SOC-init.

This fixes hanged boot on all AT91 SOCs with an RTC (but RM9200), for
example, after a reset during an RTC-update or if an RTC-alarm goes off
after shutdown (e.g. when using RTC wakeup).

The RTC and RTT-peripherals are powered by backup power (VDDBU) (on all
AT91 SOCs but RM9200) and are not reset on wake-up, user, watchdog or
software reset. This means that their interrupts may be enabled during
early boot if, for example, they where not disabled during a previous
shutdown (e.g. due to a buggy driver or a non-clean shutdown such as a
user reset). Furthermore, an RTC or RTT-alarm may also be active.

The RTC and RTT-interrupts use the shared system-interrupt line, which
is also used by the PIT, and if an interrupt occurs before a handler
(e.g. RTC-driver) has been installed this leads to the system interrupt
being disabled and prevents the system from booting.

Note that when boot hangs due to an early RTC or RTT-interrupt, the only
way to get the system to start again is to remove the backup power (e.g.
battery) or to disable the interrupt manually from the bootloader. In
particular, a user reset is not sufficient.
