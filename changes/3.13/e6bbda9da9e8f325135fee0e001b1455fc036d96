Staging: go7007: fix up some remaining go->dev issues

This fixes up the remaining "dev is used before it is set" issues in the
go7007 driver that were originally caused by commit
b6ea5ef80aa7fd6f4b18ff2e4174930e8772e812 but not fixed up by reverting
it due to other patches later on adding these "fixes".
