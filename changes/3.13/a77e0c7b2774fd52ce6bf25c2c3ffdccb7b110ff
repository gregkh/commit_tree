ARM: mm: Recreate kernel mappings in early_paging_init()

This patch adds a step in the init sequence, in order to recreate
the kernel code/data page table mappings prior to full paging
initialization.  This is necessary on LPAE systems that run out of
a physical address space outside the 4G limit.  On these systems,
this implementation provides a machine descriptor hook that allows
the PHYS_OFFSET to be overridden in a machine specific fashion.
