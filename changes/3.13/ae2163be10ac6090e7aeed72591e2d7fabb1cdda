powerpc/8xx: mfspr SPRN_TBRx in lieu of mftb/mftbu is not supported

Commit beb2dc0a7a84be003ce54e98b95d65cc66e6e536 breaks the MPC8xx which
seems to not support using mfspr SPRN_TBRx instead of mftb/mftbu
despite what is written in the reference manual.

This patch reverts to the use of mftb/mftbu when CONFIG_8xx is
selected.
