ARM: bL_switcher: move to dedicated threads rather than workqueues

The workqueues are problematic as they may be contended.
They can't be scheduled with top priority either.  Also the optimization
in bL_switch_request() to skip the workqueue entirely when the target CPU
and the calling CPU were the same didn't allow for bL_switch_request() to
be called from atomic context, as might be the case for some cpufreq
drivers.

Let's move to dedicated kthreads instead.
