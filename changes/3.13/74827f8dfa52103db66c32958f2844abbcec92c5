staging: ft1000: style issues fixed in write_blk

function write_blk, in ft1000_download.c, contains many coding style
issues. It has indentations of 3 spaces, long lines, C99 comments, and
extra whitespace. It also has a return type of u32, and changing the
returned variable in the function triggers a checkpatch leading spaces
warning. Indentation should be fixed throughout the file for
consistency.

This patch fixes those issues, in preparation for correcting the status
return type throughout the file. The variable Status has been changed
from u32 to int and renamed status.
