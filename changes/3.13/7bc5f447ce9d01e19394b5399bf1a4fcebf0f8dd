ima: define new function ima_alloc_init_template() to API

Instead of allocating and initializing the template entry from multiple
places (eg. boot aggregate, violation, and regular measurements), this
patch defines a new function called ima_alloc_init_template().  The new
function allocates and initializes the measurement entry with the inode
digest and the filename.

In respect to the current behavior, it truncates the file name passed
in the 'filename' argument if the latter's size is greater than 255 bytes
and the passed file descriptor is NULL.

Changelog:
- initialize 'hash' variable for non TPM case - Mimi
- conform to expectation for 'iint' to be defined as a pointer. - Mimi
- add missing 'file' dependency for recalculating file hash. - Mimi
