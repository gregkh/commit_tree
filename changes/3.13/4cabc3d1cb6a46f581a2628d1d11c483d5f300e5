tools/perf/stat: Add perf stat --transaction

Add support to perf stat to print the basic transactional execution statistics:
Total cycles, Cycles in Transaction, Cycles in aborted transsactions
using the in_tx and in_tx_checkpoint qualifiers.
Transaction Starts and Elision Starts, to compute the average transaction
length.

This is a reasonable overview over the success of the transactions.

Also support architectures that have a transaction aborted cycles
counter like POWER8. Since that is awkward to handle in the kernel
abstract handle both cases here.

Enable with a new --transaction / -T option.

This requires measuring these events in a group, since they depend on each
other.

This is implemented by using TM sysfs events exported by the kernel
