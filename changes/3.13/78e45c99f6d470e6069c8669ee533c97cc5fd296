ASoC: pcm: Always honor DAI min and max sample rate constraints

snd_pcm_limit_hw_rates() will initialize the minimum and maximum sample rate for
the PCM stream based on the rates specified in the rates field. Since we call
snd_pcm_limit_hw_rates() after soc_pcm_init_runtime_hw() it will essentially
overwrite the min and max rate set in soc_pcm_init_runtime_hw(). This may cause
the minimum or maximum rate to be set to a value outside the range of one of the
components if one of the components sets either SNDRV_PCM_RATE_CONTINUOUS or
SNDRV_PCM_RATE_KNOT and the other component specified a discrete rate via
SNDRV_PCM_RATE_[0-9]* that is outside of the first component's rate range. To
fix this first calculate the minimum and maximum rates using
snd_pcm_limit_hw_rates() and then on top of that apply the contraints specified
in the snd_soc_pcm_stream structs.
