sch_tbf: handle too small burst

If a too small burst is inadvertently set on TBF, we might trigger
a bug in tbf_segment(), as 'skb' instead of 'segs' was used in a
qdisc_reshape_fail() call.

tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: tbf latency 50ms burst 1KB rate
50mbit

Fix the bug, and add a warning, as such configuration is not
going to work anyway for non GSO packets.

(For some reason, one has to use a burst >= 1520 to get a working
configuration, even with old kernels. This is a probable iproute2/tc
bug)

Based on a report and initial patch from Yang Yingliang
