spi: attach/detach SPI device to the ACPI power domain

If the SPI device is enumerated from ACPI namespace (it has an ACPI handle)
it might have ACPI methods that needs to be called in order to transition
the device to different power states (such as _PSx).

We follow what has been done for platform and I2C buses here and attach the
SPI device to the ACPI power domain if the device has an ACPI handle. This
makes sure that the device is powered on when its ->probe() is called.

For non-ACPI devices this patch is a no-op.
