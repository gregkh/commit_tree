ALSA: lx6464es: Fix pointer cast compile warnings

The warnings are really harmless but annoying.  Since they are only
about debug prints, and it's at most 32bit DMA, let's just cast to
unsigned long.

  sound/pci/lx6464es/lx6464es.c:457:22: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
  sound/pci/lx6464es/lx_core.c:1195:21: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
