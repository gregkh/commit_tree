kvm: powerpc: book3s: Cleanup interrupt handling code

With this patch if HV is included, interrupts come in to the HV version
of the kvmppc_interrupt code, which then jumps to the PR handler,
renamed to kvmppc_interrupt_pr, if the guest is a PR guest. This helps
in enabling both HV and PR, which we do in later patch
