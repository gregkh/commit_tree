[media] Add support for KWorld UB435-Q V2

This patch adds support for the UB435-Q V2. You might need to
use the device once with the Windows driver provided by KWorld
in order to permanently reprogram the device descriptors. Thanks
to Jarod Wilson for the initial attempt at adding support for this
device.
