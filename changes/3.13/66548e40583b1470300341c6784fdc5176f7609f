hwrng: Add a driver for the hwrng found in power7+ systems

Add a driver for the hwrng found in power7+ systems, based on the
existing code for the arch_get_random_long() hook.

We only register a single instance of the driver, not one per device,
because we use the existing per_cpu array of devices in the arch code.
This means we always read from the "closest" device, avoiding inter-chip
memory traffic.
