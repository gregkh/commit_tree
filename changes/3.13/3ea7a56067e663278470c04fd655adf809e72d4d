ima: provide hash algo info in the xattr

All files labeled with 'security.ima' hashes, are hashed using the
same hash algorithm.  Changing from one hash algorithm to another,
requires relabeling the filesystem.  This patch defines a new xattr
type, which includes the hash algorithm, permitting different files
to be hashed with different algorithms.
