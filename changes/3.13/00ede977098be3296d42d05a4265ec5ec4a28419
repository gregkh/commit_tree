tipc: protect handler_enabled variable with qitem_lock spin lock

'handler_enabled' is a global flag indicating whether the TIPC
signal handling service is enabled or not. The lack of lock
protection for this flag incurs a risk for contention, so that
a tipc_k_signal() call might queue a signal handler to a destroyed
signal queue, with unpredictable results. To correct this, we let
the already existing 'qitem_lock' protect the flag, as it already
does with the queue itself. This way, we ensure that the flag
always is consistent across all cores.
