This is based on the work of Teddy Reed <teddy@prosauce.org> published

That driver was never merged, I have taken it as a starting port,
forward ported, tested and revised the driver:
 - Make it broadly textually similar to the Infineon and Nuvoton I2C
   driver
 - Place everything in a format suitable for mainline inclusion
 - Use high level I2C functions i2c_master_send and
   i2c_master_recv for data xfer
 - Use the timeout system from the core code, by faking out a status
   register
 - Only I2C transfer the number of bytes in the reply, not a fixed
   message size.
 - checkpatch cleanups
 - Testing on ARM Kirkwood, with this device tree, using a
   AT97SC3204T-X1A180
        tpm@29 {
                compatible = "atmel,at97sc3204t";
                reg = <0x29>;
        };
