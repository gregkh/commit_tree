of: introduce common FDT machine related functions

Introduce common of_flat_dt_match_machine and
of_flat_dt_get_machine_name functions to unify architectures' handling
of machine level model and compatible properties.

Several architectures match the root compatible string with an arch
specific list of machine descriptors duplicating the same search
algorithm. Create a common implementation with a simple architecture
specific hook to iterate over each machine's match table.
