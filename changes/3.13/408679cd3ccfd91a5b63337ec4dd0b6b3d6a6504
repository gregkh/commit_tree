[media] tda9887: remove an warning when compiling for alpha

There's no need to zero the buffer, as if the routine gets an error,
rc will be different than one.
That fixes the following warning:
	drivers/media/tuners/tda9887.c: In function 'tda9887_status':
	drivers/media/tuners/tda9887.c:539:2: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]
While here, make fix the CodingStyle on this function.
