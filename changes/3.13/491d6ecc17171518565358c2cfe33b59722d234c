KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Reduce number of shadow PTEs invalidated by MMU notifiers

Currently, whenever any of the MMU notifier callbacks get called, we
invalidate all the shadow PTEs.  This is inefficient because it means
that we typically then get a lot of DSIs and ISIs in the guest to fault
the shadow PTEs back in.  We do this even if the address range being
notified doesn't correspond to guest memory.

This commit adds code to scan the memslot array to find out what range(s)
of guest physical addresses corresponds to the host virtual address range
being affected.  For each such range we flush only the shadow PTEs
for the range, on all cpus.
