gro: Clean up tcpX_gro_receive checksum verification

This patch simplifies the checksum verification in tcpX_gro_receive
by reusing the CHECKSUM_COMPLETE code for CHECKSUM_NONE.  All it
does for CHECKSUM_NONE is compute the partial checksum and then
treat it as if it came from the hardware (CHECKSUM_COMPLETE).
