PCI: Disable Bus Master only on kexec reboot

Add a flag to tell the PCI subsystem that kernel is shutting down in
preparation to kexec a kernel.  Add code in PCI subsystem to use this flag
to clear Bus Master bit on PCI devices only in case of kexec reboot.

This fixes a power-off problem on Acer Aspire V5-573G and likely other
machines and avoids any other issues caused by clearing Bus Master bit on
PCI devices in normal shutdown path.  The problem was introduced by
b566a22c2332 ("PCI: disable Bus Master on PCI device shutdown").

This patch is based on discussion at
