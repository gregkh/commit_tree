USB: EHCI: check the right uframes for CSPLIT

The check_intr_schedule() routine in ehci-hcd looks at the wrong
microframes when checking to see if a full-speed or low-speed
interrupt endpoint will fit in the periodic schedule.  If the
Start-Split transaction is scheduled for microframe N then the
Complete-Split transactions get scheduled for microframes N+2, N+3, and
N+4.  However the code considers N+1, N+2, and N+3 instead.

This patch fixes the limits on the "for" loop and also improves the
use of whitespace.
