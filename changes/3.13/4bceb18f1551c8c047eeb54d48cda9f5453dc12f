xfs: vectorise DA btree operations

The remaining non-vectorised code for the directory structure is the
node format blocks. This is shared with the attribute tree, and so
is slightly more complex to vectorise.

Introduce a "non-directory" directory ops structure that is attached
to all non-directory inodes so that attribute operations can be
vectorised for all inodes.

Once we do this, we can vectorise all the da btree operations.
Because this patch adds more infrastructure than it removes the
binary size does not decrease:
