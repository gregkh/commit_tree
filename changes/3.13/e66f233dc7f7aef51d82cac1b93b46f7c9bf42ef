ARM: Samsung: Remove the MIPI PHY setup code

Generic PHY drivers are used to handle the MIPI CSIS and MIPI DSIM
DPHYs so we can remove now unused code at arch/arm/plat-samsung.
In case there is any board file for S5PV210 platforms using MIPI
CSIS/DSIM (not any upstream currently) it should use the generic
PHY API to bind the PHYs to respective PHY consumer drivers and
a platform device for the PHY provider should be defined.
