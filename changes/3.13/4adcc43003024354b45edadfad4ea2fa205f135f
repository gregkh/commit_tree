perf tools: Fix srcline sort key behavior

Currently the srcline sort key compares ip rather than srcline info.  I
guess this was due to a performance reason to run external addr2line
utility.  Now we have implemented the functionality inside, use the
srcline info when comparing hist entries.

Also constantly print "??:0" string for unknown srcline rather than
printing ip.
