Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle OHCI controller suspend"

This reverts commit 476e4bf939c9b947ea49923700fbac655cc9057c.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
