bcache: Don't bother with bucket refcount for btree node allocations

The bucket refcount (dropped with bkey_put()) is only needed to prevent
the newly allocated bucket from being garbage collected until we've
added a pointer to it somewhere. But for btree node allocations, the
fact that we have btree nodes locked is enough to guard against races
with garbage collection.

Eventually the per bucket refcount is going to be replaced with
something specific to bch_alloc_sectors().
