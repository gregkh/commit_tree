net: introduce SO_MAX_PACING_RATE

As mentioned in commit afe4fd062416b ("pkt_sched: fq: Fair Queue packet
scheduler"), this patch adds a new socket option.

SO_MAX_PACING_RATE offers the application the ability to cap the
rate computed by transport layer. Value is in bytes per second.

u32 val = 1000000;
setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_MAX_PACING_RATE, &val, sizeof(val));

To be effectively paced, a flow must use FQ packet scheduler.

Note that a packet scheduler takes into account the headers for its
computations. The effective payload rate depends on MSS and retransmits
if any.

I chose to make this pacing rate a SOL_SOCKET option instead of a
TCP one because this can be used by other protocols.
