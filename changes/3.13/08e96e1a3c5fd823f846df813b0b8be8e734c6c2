xfs: remove newlines from strings passed to __xfs_printk

__xfs_printk adds its own "\n".  Having it in the original string
leads to unintentional blank lines from these messages.

Most format strings have no newline, but a few do, leading to
i.e.:

[ 7347.119911] XFS (sdb2): Access to block zero in inode 132 start_block: 0 start_off: 0 blkcnt: 0 extent-state: 0 lastx: 1a05
[ 7347.119911] 
[ 7347.119919] XFS (sdb2): Access to block zero in inode 132 start_block: 0 start_off: 0 blkcnt: 0 extent-state: 0 lastx: 1a05
[ 7347.119919] 

Fix them all.
