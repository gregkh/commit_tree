arm64: Move PTE_PROT_NONE higher up

PTE_PROT_NONE means that a pte is present but does not have any
read/write attributes. However, setting the memory type like
pgprot_writecombine() is allowed and such bits overlap with
PTE_PROT_NONE. This causes mmap/munmap issues in drivers that change the
vma->vm_pg_prot on PROT_NONE mappings.

This patch reverts the PTE_FILE/PTE_PROT_NONE shift in commit
59911ca4325d (ARM64: mm: Move PTE_PROT_NONE bit) and moves PTE_PROT_NONE
together with the other software bits.
