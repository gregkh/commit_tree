ath5k: fix regression in tx status processing

The regression was introduced in the following commit:

0967e01e8e713ed2982fb4eba8ba13794e9a6e89
"ath5k: make use of the new rate control API"

ath5k_tx_frame_completed saves the intended per-rate retry counts before
they are cleared by ieee80211_tx_info_clear_status, however at this
point the information in info->status.rates is incomplete.

This causes significant throughput degradation and excessive packet loss
on links where high bit rates don't work properly.

Move the copy from bf->rates a few lines up to ensure that the saved
retry counts are updated, and that they are really cleared in
info->status.rates after the call to ieee80211_tx_info_clear_status.
