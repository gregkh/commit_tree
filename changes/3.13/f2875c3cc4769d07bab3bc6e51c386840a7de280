tipc: avoid unnecessary lookup for tipc bearer instance

tipc_block_bearer() currently takes a bearer name (const char*)
as argument. This requires the function to make a lookup to find
the pointer to the corresponding bearer struct. In the current
code base this is not necessary, since the only two callers
(tipc_continue(),recv_notification()) already have validated
copies of this pointer, and hence can pass it directly in the
function call.

We change tipc_block_bearer() to directly take struct tipc_bearer*
as argument instead.
