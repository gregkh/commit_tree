Revert "drm/radeon/audio: don't set speaker allocation on DCE4+"

This reverts commit 555b1b651acf44bf27ebbb04235d38a8fd2d58dc.

Let's try this again for 3.13.  It's required for proper
interaction with alsa.  Was disabled previously in 3.12
to be on the safe side since it caused problems on older
asics.
