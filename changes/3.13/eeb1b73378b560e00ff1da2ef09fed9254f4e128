xfrm: Increase the garbage collector threshold

With the removal of the routing cache, we lost the
option to tweak the garbage collector threshold
along with the maximum routing cache size. So git
commit 703fb94ec ("xfrm: Fix the gc threshold value
for ipv4") moved back to a static threshold.

It turned out that the current threshold before we
start garbage collecting is much to small for some
workloads, so increase it from 1024 to 32768. This
means that we start the garbage collector if we have
more than 32768 dst entries in the system and refuse
new allocations if we are above 65536.
