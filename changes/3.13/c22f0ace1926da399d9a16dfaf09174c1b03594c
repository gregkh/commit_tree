drm: merge device setup into drm_dev_register()

All bus drivers do device setup themselves. This requires us to adjust all
of them if we introduce new core features. Thus, merge all these into a
uniform drm_dev_register() helper.

Note that this removes the drm_lastclose() error path for AGP as it is
horribly broken. Moreover, no bus driver called this in any other error
path either. Instead, we use the recently introduced AGP cleanup helpers.

We also keep a DRIVER_MODESET condition around pci_set_drvdata() to keep
semantics.
