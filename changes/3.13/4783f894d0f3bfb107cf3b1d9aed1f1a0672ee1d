checkpatch.pl: check for the FSF mailing address

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the FSF
has moved in the past and may do so again.

Make this an error for new code, but just a --strict CHK in --file mode;
anyone interested in doing tree-wide cleanups of this form can enable this
test explicitly.
