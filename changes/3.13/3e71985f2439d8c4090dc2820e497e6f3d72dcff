drm/radeon/audio: correct ACR table

The values were taken from the HDMI spec, but they assumed
exact x/1.001 clocks. Since we round the clocks, we also need
to calculate different N and CTS values.

Note that the N for 25.2/1.001 MHz at 44.1 kHz audio is out of
spec. Hopefully this mode is rarely used and/or HDMI sinks
tolerate overly large values of N.
