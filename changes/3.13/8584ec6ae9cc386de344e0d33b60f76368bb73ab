ACPI / IPMI: Fix race caused by the timed out ACPI IPMI transfers

This patch fixes races caused by timed out ACPI IPMI transfers.

This patch uses timeout mechanism provided by ipmi_si to avoid the race
that the msg_done flag is set but without any protection, its content can
be invalid.  Thanks for the suggestion of Corey Minyard.
