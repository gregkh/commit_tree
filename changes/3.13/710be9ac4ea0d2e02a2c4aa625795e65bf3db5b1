arm64: big-endian: write CPU holding pen address as LE

Currently when CPUs are brought online via a spin-table, the address
they should jump to is written to the cpu-release-addr in the kernel's
native endianness. As the kernel may switch endianness, secondaries
might read the value byte-reversed from what was intended, and they
would jump to the wrong address.

As the only current arm64 spin-table implementations are
little-endian, stricten up the arm64 spin-table definition such that
the value written to cpu-release-addr is _always_ little-endian
regardless of the endianness of any CPU. If a spinning CPU is
operating big-endian, it must byte-reverse the value before jumping to
handle this.
