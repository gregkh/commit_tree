mtd: nand: omap2: clean-up BCHx_HW and BCHx_SW ECC configurations in device_probe

current implementation in omap3_init_bch() has some redundant code like:
(1) omap3_init_bch() re-probes the DT-binding to detect presence of ELM h/w
    engine on SoC. And based on that it selects implemetation of ecc-scheme.
    However, this is already done as part of GPMC DT parsing.
(2) As omap3_init_bch() serves as common function for configuring all types of
    BCHx ecc-schemes, so there are multiple levels of redudant if..then..else
    checks while populating nand_chip->ecc.

This patch make following changes to OMAP NAND driver:
(1) removes omap3_init_bch(): each ecc-scheme is individually configured in
    omap_nand_probe() there by removing redundant if..then..else checks.
(2) adds is_elm_present(): re-probing of ELM device via DT is not required as
    it's done in GPMC driver probe. Thus is_elm_present() just initializes ELM
    driver with NAND probe data, when ecc-scheme with h/w based error-detection
    is used.
(3) separates out configuration of different flavours of "BCH4" and "BCH8"
    ecc-schemes as given in below table
(4) conditionally compiles callbacks implementations of ecc.hwctl(),
    ecc.calculate(), ecc.correct() to avoid warning of un-used functions.

- 'CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC_BCH' is generic KConfig required to build lib/bch.c
    which is required for ECC error detection done in software.
    (mainly used for legacy platforms which do not have on-chip ELM engine)

- 'CONFIG_MTD_NAND_OMAP_BCH' is OMAP specific Kconfig to detemine presence
    on ELM h/w engine on SoC.
