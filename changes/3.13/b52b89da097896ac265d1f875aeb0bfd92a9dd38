drm/i915: Add a tracepoint for using a semaphore

So that we can find the callers who introduce a ring stall. A single
ring stall is not too unwelcome, the right issue becomes when they start
to interlock and prevent any concurrent work. That, however, is a little
tricker to detect with a mere tracepoint!

v2: Rebrand it as a ring event, rather than an object event.
v3: Include the seqno in the tracepoint for posterity or something.
