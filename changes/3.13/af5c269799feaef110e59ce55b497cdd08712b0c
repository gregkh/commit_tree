GFS2: Clean up reservation removal

The reservation for an inode should be cleared when it is truncated so
that we can start again at a different offset for future allocations.
We could try and do better than that, by resetting the search based on
where the truncation started from, but this is only a first step.

In addition, there are three callers of gfs2_rs_delete() but only one
of those should really be testing the value of i_writecount. While
we get away with that in the other cases currently, I think it would
be better if we made that test specific to the one case which
requires it.
