bridge: netfilter: orphan skb before invoking ip netfilter hooks

Pekka Pietikäinen reports xt_socket behavioural change after commit
00028aa37098o (netfilter: xt_socket: use IP early demux).

Reason is xt_socket now no longer does an unconditional sk lookup -
it re-uses existing skb->sk if possible, assuming ->sk was set by
ip early demux.

However, when netfilter is invoked via bridge, this can cause 'bogus'
sockets to be examined by the match, e.g. a 'tun' device socket.

bridge netfilter should orphan the skb just like the routing path
before invoking ipv4/ipv6 netfilter hooks to avoid this.
