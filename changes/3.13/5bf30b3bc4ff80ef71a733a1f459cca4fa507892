[media] av7110_hw: Don't use dynamic static allocation

Dynamic static allocation is evil, as Kernel stack is too low, and
compilation complains about it on some archs:
	drivers/media/pci/ttpci/av7110_hw.c:510:1: warning: 'av7110_fw_cmd' uses dynamic stack allocation [enabled by default]
Instead, let's enforce a limit for the buffer.
In the specific case of this driver, the maximum fw command size
is 6 + 2, as checked using:
	$ git grep -A1 av7110_fw_cmd drivers/media/pci/ttpci/
So, use 8 for the buffer size.
