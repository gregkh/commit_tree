s390/3270: fix allocation of tty3270_screen structure

The tty3270_alloc_screen function is called from tty3270_install with
swapped arguments, the number of columns instead of rows and vice versa.
The number of rows is typically smaller than the number of columns which
makes the screen array too big but the individual cell arrays for the
lines too small. Creating lines longer than the number of rows will
clobber the memory after the end of the cell array.
The fix is simple, call tty3270_alloc_screen with the correct argument
order.
