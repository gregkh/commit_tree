ARM: 7854/1: lockref: add support for lockless lockrefs using cmpxchg64

Our spinlocks are only 32-bit (2x16-bit tickets) and, on processors
with 64-bit atomic instructions, cmpxchg64 makes use of the double-word
exclusive accessors.

This patch wires up the cmpxchg-based lockless lockref implementation
for ARM.
