iscsi-target: Fix incorrect np->np_thread NULL assignment

When shutting down a target there is a race condition between
iscsit_del_np() and __iscsi_target_login_thread().
The latter sets the thread pointer to NULL, and the former
tries to issue kthread_stop() on that pointer without any
synchronization.

This patch moves the np->np_thread NULL assignment into
iscsit_del_np(), after kthread_stop() has completed. It also
removes the signal_pending() + np_state check, and only
exits when kthread_should_stop() is true.
