net: Fix "ip rule delete table 256"

When trying to delete a table >= 256 using iproute2 the local table
will be deleted.
The table id is specified as a netlink attribute when it needs more then
8 bits and iproute2 then sets the table field to RT_TABLE_UNSPEC (0).
Preconditions to matching the table id in the rule delete code
doesn't seem to take the "table id in netlink attribute" into condition
so the frh_get_table helper function never gets to do its job when
matching against current rule.
Use the helper function twice instead of peaking at the table value directly.
