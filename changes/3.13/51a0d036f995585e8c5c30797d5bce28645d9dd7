ARM: drivers/rtc/rtc-at91rm9200.c: disable interrupts at shutdown

Make sure RTC-interrupts are disabled at shutdown.

As the RTC is generally powered by backup power (VDDBU), its interrupts
are not disabled on wake-up, user, watchdog or software reset.  This
could cause troubles on other systems (e.g.  older kernels) if an
interrupt occurs before a handler has been installed at next boot.

Let us be well-behaved and disable them on clean shutdowns at least (as
do the RTT-based rtc-at91sam9 driver).
