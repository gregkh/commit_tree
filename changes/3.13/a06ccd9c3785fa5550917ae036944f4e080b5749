regulator: core: Add ability to create a lookup alias for supply

These patches add the ability to create an alternative device on which
a lookup for a certain supply should be conducted.

A common use-case for this would be devices that are logically
represented as a collection of drivers within Linux but are are
presented as a single device from device tree. It this case it is
necessary for each sub device to locate their supply data on the main
device.
