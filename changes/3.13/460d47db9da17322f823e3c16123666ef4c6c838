DMA-API: usb: musb: use platform_device_register_full() to avoid directly messing with dma masks

Use platform_device_register_full() for those drivers which can, to
avoid messing directly with DMA masks.  This can only be done when
the driver does not need to access the allocated musb platform device
from within its callbacks, which may be called during the musb
device probing.
