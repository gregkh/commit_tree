time: Fix signedness bug in sysfs_get_uname() and its callers

sysfs_get_uname() is erroneously declared as returning size_t even
though it may return a negative value, specifically -EINVAL.  Its
callers then check whether its return value is less than zero and indeed
that is never the case for size_t.

This patch changes sysfs_get_uname() to return ssize_t and makes sure
its callers use ssize_t accordingly.

[jstultz: Didn't apply cleanly, as a similar partial fix was also applied
so had to resolve the collisions]
