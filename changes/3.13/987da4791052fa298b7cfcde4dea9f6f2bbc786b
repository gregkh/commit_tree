nfsd: make sure to balance get/put_write_access

Use a straight goto error label style in nfsd_setattr to make sure
we always do the put_write_access call after we got it earlier.

Note that the we have been failing to do that in the case
nfsd_break_lease() returns an error, a bug introduced into 2.6.38 with
6a76bebefe15d9a08864f824d7f8d5beaf37c997 "nfsd4: break lease on nfsd
setattr".
