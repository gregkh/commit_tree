macvlan: forbid L2 fowarding offload for macvtap

L2 fowarding offload will bypass the rx handler of real device. This will make
the packet could not be forwarded to macvtap device. Another problem is the
dev_hard_start_xmit() called for macvtap does not have any synchronization.

Fix this by forbidding L2 forwarding for macvtap.
