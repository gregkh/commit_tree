ALSA: hda - hdmi: Use TFx channel positions instead of FxH

Channel map positions FLH, FCH, FRH duplicate positions TFL, TFC, TFR.
Both are the speakers above the front speakers (CEA uses "high" and USB
audio uses "top" nomenclature).

Since the USB audio code has used the TFx positions since v3.8
(04324ccc75f96, "ALSA: usb-audio: add channel map support") but the HDMI
code only just started using FxH in a5b7d510b2220cccb ("ALSA: hda -
hdmi: Fix channel maps with less common speakers") which is not yet in
any released kernel, standardize on TFx instead.
