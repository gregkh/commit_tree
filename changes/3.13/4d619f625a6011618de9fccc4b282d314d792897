net: cdc_ncm: no point in filling up the NTBs if we send ZLPs

Padding NTBs to max size is part of the support for devices
optimizing their DMA transfers. This optimization depends on
max sized NTBs not being ZLP terminated. So we are much better
off dropping the padding if we are going to send a ZLP anyway.
