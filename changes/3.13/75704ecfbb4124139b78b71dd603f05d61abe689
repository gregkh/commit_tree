ASoC: wm8962: Enable SYSCLK provisonally before fetching generated DSPCLK_DIV

DSPCLK_DIV can be only generated correctly after enabling SYSCLK. But if the
current bias_level hasn't reached SND_SOC_BIAS_ON, DAPM won't enable SYSCLK,
which would cause the calculation result from DSPCLK_DIV invalid since bit
DSPCLK_DIV will be finally turned to its true value after DAPM enables SYSCLK
while the driver won't calculate it again for the current instance. In this
circumstance, a playback which needs non-zero DSPCLK_DIV would be distorted
due to unexpected clock frequency resulted from an invalid DSPCLK_DIV value.

So this patch provisionally enables the SYSCLK to get a valid DSPCLK_DIV for
calculation and then disables it afterward.
