TTY: hvc_dcc: probe for a JTAG connection before registering

Enabling the ARM DCC console and using without a JTAG connection will
simply hang the system. Since distros like to turn on all options, this
is a reoccurring problem to debug. We can do better by checking if
anything is attached and handling characters. There is no way to probe
this, so send a newline and check that it is handled.
