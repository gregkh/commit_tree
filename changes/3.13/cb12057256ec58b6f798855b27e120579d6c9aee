ARM: s3c64xx: dt: Fix boot failure due to double clock initialization

Commit

4178bac ARM: call of_clk_init from default time_init handler

added implicit call to of_clk_init() from default time_init callback,
but it did not change platforms calling it from other callbacks, despite
of not having custom time_init callbacks. This caused double clock
initialization on such platforms, leading to boot failures. An example
of such platform is mach-s3c64xx.

This patch fixes boot failure on s3c64xx by dropping custom init_irq
callback, which had a call to of_clk_init() and moving system reset
initialization to init_machine callback. This allows us to have
clocks initialized properly without a need to have custom init_time or
init_irq callbacks.
