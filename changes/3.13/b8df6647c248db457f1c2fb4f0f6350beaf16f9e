skd: register block device only if some devices are present

Register block device in skd_pci_probe() instead of in skd_init() so it
is registered only if some devices are present (currently it is always
registered when the driver is loaded). Please note that this change
depends on the fact that register_blkdev(0, ...) never returns 0.
