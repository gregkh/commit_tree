regulator: core: Provide a dummy regulator with full constraints

When a system has said that it has fully specified constraints for its
regulators it is still possible that some supplies may be missing,
especially if regulator support has been added to a driver after the
board was integrated. We can handle such situations more gracefully by
providing a dummy regulator.

Unless the caller has specifically indicated that the system design may
not include a given regulator by using regulator_get_optional() or that
it needs its interactions to have an effect using regulator_get_exclusive()
provide a dummy regulator if we can't locate a real one.

The kconfig option REGULATOR_DUMMY that provided similar behaviour for all
regulators has been removed, systems that need it should flag that they
have full constraints instead.
