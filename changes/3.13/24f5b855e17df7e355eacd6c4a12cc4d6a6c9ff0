ipv6: always set the new created dst's from in ip6_rt_copy

ip6_rt_copy only sets dst.from if ort has flag RTF_ADDRCONF and RTF_DEFAULT.
but the prefix routes which did get installed by hand locally can have an
expiration, and no any flag combination which can ensure a potential from
does never expire, so we should always set the new created dst's from.

This also fixes the new created dst is always expired since the ort, which
is created by RA, maybe has RTF_EXPIRES and RTF_ADDRCONF, but no RTF_DEFAULT.
