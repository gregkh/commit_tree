btrfs: fix empty_zero_page misusage

Heiko Carstens noticed that btrfs was using empty_zero_page
incorrectly.  He explained:

	The definition of empty_zero_page is architecture specific.  It
	is (currently) either a character array, an unsigned long
	containing the address of the empty_zero_page, or even worse
	only the address of the struct page belonging to the
	empty_zero_page.

This commit changes btrfs to use a for-loop instead.  On x86
the resulting .ko is smaller, and we're no longer worrying about
how each arch builds its zeros.
