iio: Add tcs3472 color light sensor driver

chip has four 16-bit channels for red, green, blue, clear color
intensity; driver supports the TCS3x7x family of devices and was
tested with a TCS34725 chip; further information here:

v2 (thanks to Jonathan Cameron):
* drop dynamic buffer allocation, buffer is in tcs3472_data
* limit sysfs output to PAGE_SIZE
* check val2 == 0 when writing CALIBSCALE
