misc: mic: Fix user space namespace pollution from mic_common.h.

Avoid declaring ALIGN() and __aligned() in
include/uapi/linux/mic_common.h since they pollute user space
namespace. Also, mic_aligned_size() can be simply replaced simply by
sizeof() since all structures where mic_aligned_size() is used are
declared using __attribute__ ((aligned(8)));

This puts two macros, ALIGN() and __aligned(), into arbitrary user space
namespace.  This really isn't safe or acceptable, especially since those
symbols are highly generic.
...
When these structures are forced-aligned, they will in fact have padding
automatically added by the compiler to an 8-byte boundary anyway, so
mic_aligned_size() does nothing.
