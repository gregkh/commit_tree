mmc: omap: Remove redundant suspend and resume callbacks

Suspend and resume of cards are handled by the protocol layer and
consequently the mmc_suspend|resume_host APIs are marked as deprecated.

While moving away from using the deprecated APIs, there are nothing
left to be done for the suspend and resume callbacks, so remove them.
