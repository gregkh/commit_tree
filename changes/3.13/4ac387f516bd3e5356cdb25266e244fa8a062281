drm: simplify drm_put_minor()

Allow passing NULL as minor to simplify DRM destruction paths. Also remove
the double-pointer reset as it is no longer needed. drm_put_minor() is
only called when the underlying object is destroyed. Hence, resetting
minors to NULL is not necessary.

As drm_put_minor() is no longer used by other DRM files, we can make it
static, too.
