perf: Do not waste PAGE_SIZE bytes for ALIGN(8) in perf_event_mmap_event()

perf_event_mmap_event() does kzalloc(PATH_MAX + sizeof(u64)) to
ensure we can align the size later. However this means that we
actually allocate PAGE_SIZE * 2 buffer, seems too much.

Change this code to allocate PATH_MAX==PAGE_SIZE bytes, but tell
d_path() to not use the last sizeof(u64) bytes.

Note: it is not clear why do we need __GFP_ZERO, see the next patch.
