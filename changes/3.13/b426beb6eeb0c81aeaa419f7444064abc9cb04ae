X.509: Embed public_key_signature struct and create filler function

Embed a public_key_signature struct in struct x509_certificate, eliminating
now unnecessary fields, and split x509_check_signature() to create a filler
function for it that attaches a digest of the signed data and an MPI that
represents the signature data.  x509_free_certificate() is then modified to
deal with these.

Whilst we're at it, export both x509_check_signature() and the new
x509_get_sig_params().
