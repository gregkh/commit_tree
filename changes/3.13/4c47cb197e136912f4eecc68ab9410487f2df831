ACPI: delete CONFIG_ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR

About 10 years ago, this option was created to help
distros enable ACPI and not get distracted by ACPI
BIOS issues in machines which were deemed old
at that time, eg 1999 and earlier.

After a couple of years, the high volume distros
stopped bothering to set this option, and instead
simply ran in ACPI mode on all systems with an
ACPI BIOS -- regardless of BIOS DMI year.

Recently there have been some ACPI-enabled systems
with no DMI, mandating that CONFIG_ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR=0.

So it seems vanishingly unlikely that this option
is helping anybody run a 2013 kernel on a 1998 system,
and now more systems mandate this option be disabled,
so we simplify by deleting it entirely.
