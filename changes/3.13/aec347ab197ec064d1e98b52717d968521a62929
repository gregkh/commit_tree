drm/i915: Delay the release of the forcewake by a jiffie

Obtaining the forcwake requires expensive and time consuming
serialisation. And we often try to obtain the forcewake multiple times
in very quick succession. We can reduce the overhead of these sequences
by delaying the forcewake release, and so not hammer the hw quite so
hard.

I was hoping this would help with the spurious
[drm:__gen6_gt_force_wake_mt_get] *ERROR* Timed out waiting for forcewake old ack to clear.
found on Haswell. Alas not.

v2: Fix teardown ordering - unmap the regs after turning off forcewake,
and make sure we do turn off forcewake - both found by Ville.

v3: As we introduce intel_uncore_fini(), use it to make sure everything
is disabled before we hand back to the BIOS.

Note: I have no claims for improved performance, stablity or power
comsumption for this patch. We should not be hitting the registers often
enough for this to improve benchmarks, but given the nature of our hw it
is likely to improve long term stability.
