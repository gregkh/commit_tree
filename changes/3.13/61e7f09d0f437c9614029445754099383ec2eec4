ipv4: consistent reporting of pmtu data in case of corking

We report different pmtu values back on the first write and on further
writes on an corked socket.

Also don't include the dst.header_len (respectively exthdrlen) as this
should already be dealt with by the interface mtu of the outgoing
(virtual) interface and policy of that interface should dictate if
fragmentation should happen.

Instead reduce the pmtu data by IP options as we do for IPv6. Make the
same changes for ip_append_data, where we did not care about options or
dst.header_len at all.
