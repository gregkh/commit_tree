Btrfs: remove scrub_super_lock holding in btrfs_sync_log()

Originally, we introduced scrub_super_lock to synchronize
tree log code with scrubbing super.

However we can replace scrub_super_lock with device_list_mutex,
because writing super will hold this mutex, this will reduce an extra
lock holding when writing supers in sync log code.
