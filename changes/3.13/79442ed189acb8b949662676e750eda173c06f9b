mm/memblock.c: introduce bottom-up allocation mode

The Linux kernel cannot migrate pages used by the kernel.  As a result,
kernel pages cannot be hot-removed.  So we cannot allocate hotpluggable
memory for the kernel.

ACPI SRAT (System Resource Affinity Table) contains the memory hotplug
info.  But before SRAT is parsed, memblock has already started to allocate
memory for the kernel.  So we need to prevent memblock from doing this.

In a memory hotplug system, any numa node the kernel resides in should be
unhotpluggable.  And for a modern server, each node could have at least
16GB memory.  So memory around the kernel image is highly likely
unhotpluggable.

So the basic idea is: Allocate memory from the end of the kernel image and
to the higher memory.  Since memory allocation before SRAT is parsed won't
be too much, it could highly likely be in the same node with kernel image.

The current memblock can only allocate memory top-down.  So this patch
introduces a new bottom-up allocation mode to allocate memory bottom-up.
And later when we use this allocation direction to allocate memory, we
will limit the start address above the kernel.
