mmc: dw_mmc: exynos: adjust the clock rate with speed mode

Exynos's host has divider logic before 'cclk_in' to controller core.
It means that actual clock rate of ciu clock comes from this divider
value. So, source clock should be adjusted along with 'ciu_div' which
indicates the host's divider ratio. Setting clock rate basically fits
the required speed. Specially, 'cclk_in' should have double rate of
target speed in case of DDR 8-bit mode.
