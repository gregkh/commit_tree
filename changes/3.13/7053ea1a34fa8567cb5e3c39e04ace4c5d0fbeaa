stop_machine: Fix race between stop_two_cpus() and stop_cpus()

There is a race between stop_two_cpus, and the global stop_cpus.

It is possible for two CPUs to get their stopper functions queued
"backwards" from one another, resulting in the stopper threads
getting stuck, and the system hanging. This can happen because
queuing up stoppers is not synchronized.

This patch adds synchronization between stop_cpus (a rare operation),
and stop_two_cpus.
