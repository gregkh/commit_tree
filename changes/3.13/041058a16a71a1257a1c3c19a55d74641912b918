s390/cmm: make copy_from_user() invocation provably correct

Get rid of these two warnings:

In function 'copy_from_user',
    inlined from 'cmm_timeout_handler' at arch/s390/mm/cmm.c:310:
      uaccess.h:303: warning: call to 'copy_from_user_overflow' declared
      with attribute warning: copy_from_user() buffer size is not provably
      correct
In function 'copy_from_user',
    inlined from 'cmm_pages_handler' at arch/s390/mm/cmm.c:270:
      uaccess.h:303: warning: call to 'copy_from_user_overflow' declared
      with attribute warning: copy_from_user() buffer size is not provably
      correct

Change the "len" type to unsigned int, so we can make sure that there is no
buffer overflow. This also generates less code.
