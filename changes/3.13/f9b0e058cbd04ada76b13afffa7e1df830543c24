writeback: Fix data corruption on NFS

Commit 4f8ad655dbc8 "writeback: Refactor writeback_single_inode()" added
a condition to skip clean inode. However this is wrong in WB_SYNC_ALL
mode because there we also want to wait for outstanding writeback on
possibly clean inode. This was causing occasional data corruption issues
on NFS because it uses sync_inode() to make sure all outstanding writes
are flushed to the server before truncating the inode and with
sync_inode() returning prematurely file was sometimes extended back
by an outstanding write after it was truncated.

So modify the test to also check for pages under writeback in
WB_SYNC_ALL mode.
