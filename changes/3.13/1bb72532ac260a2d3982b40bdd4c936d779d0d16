drm: add drm_dev_alloc() helper

Instead of managing device allocation+initialization in each bus-driver,
we should do that in a central place. drm_fill_in_dev() already does most
of it, but also requires the global drm lock for partial AGP device
registration.

Split both apart so we have a clean device initialization/allocation
phase, and a registration phase.
