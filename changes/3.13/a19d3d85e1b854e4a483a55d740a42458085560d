batman-adv: limit local translation table max size

The local translation table size is limited by what can be
transferred from one node to another via a full table request.

The number of entries fitting into a full table request depend
on whether the fragmentation is enabled or not. Therefore this
patch introduces a max table size check and refuses to add
more local clients when that size is reached. Moreover, if the
max full table packet size changes (MTU change or fragmentation
is disabled) the local table is downsized instantaneously.
