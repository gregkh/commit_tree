list: introduce list_next_entry() and list_prev_entry()

Add two trivial helpers list_next_entry() and list_prev_entry(), they
can have a lot of users including list.h itself.  In fact the 1st one is
already defined in events/core.c and bnx2x_sp.c, so the patch simply
moves the definition to list.h.
