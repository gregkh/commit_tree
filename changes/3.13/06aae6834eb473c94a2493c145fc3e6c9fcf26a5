s390/vdso: fix access-list entry initialization

The access-list entry is supposed to have the fetch-only bit set, however
a reserved bit got set instead.
Userspace isn't able to write to the page anyway since the accessed page
has the read-only bit set. So this saves us only for bad surprises in the
future if the reserved bit gets used.
