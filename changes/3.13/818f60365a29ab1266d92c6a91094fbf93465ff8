USB: serial: add memory flags to usb_serial_generic_write_start

Add memory-flags parameter to usb_serial_generic_write_start which is
called from write, resume and completion handler, all with different
allocation requirements.

Note that by using the memory flag to determine when called from the
completion handler, everything will work as before even if the
completion handler is run with interrupts enabled (as suggested).
