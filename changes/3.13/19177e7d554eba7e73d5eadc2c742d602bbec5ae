bonding: make __get_active_agg() use bond_for_each_slave()

Currently we're relying on suboptimal construct

for (; aggregator; aggregator = __get_next_agg(aggregator)) {

where aggregator is an argument of __get_active_agg() which is _always_ the
first slave's aggregator - judging by all the callers, comments in the
ad_agg_selection_logic() and by logic.

Convert it to use the standard bond_for_each_slave().
