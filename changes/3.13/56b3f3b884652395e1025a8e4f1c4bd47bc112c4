sysfs: merge sysfs_elem_bin_attr into sysfs_elem_attr

3124eb1679 ("sysfs: merge regular and bin file handling") folded bin
file handling into regular file handling.  Among other things, bin
file now shares the same open path including sysfs_open_dirent
association using sysfs_dirent->s_attr.open.  This is buggy because
->s_bin_attr lives in the same union and doesn't have the field.  This
bug doesn't trigger because sysfs_elem_bin_attr doesn't have an active
field at the conflicting position.  It does have a field "buffers" but
it isn't used anymore.

This patch collapses sysfs_elem_bin_attr into sysfs_elem_attr so that
the bin_attr is accessed through ->s_attr.bin_attr which lives with
->s_attr.attr in an anonymous union.  The code paths already assume
bin_attr contains attr as the first element, so this doesn't add any
more assumptions while making it explicit that the two types are
handled together.
