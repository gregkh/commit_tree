efi: Add system table pointer argument to shared functions.

Add system table pointer argument to shared EFI stub related functions
so they no longer use a global system table pointer as they did when part
of eboot.c.  For the ARM EFI stub this allows us to avoid global
variables completely and thereby not have to deal with GOT fixups.
Not having the EFI stub fixup its GOT, which is shared with the
decompressor, simplifies the relocating of the zImage to a
bootable address.
