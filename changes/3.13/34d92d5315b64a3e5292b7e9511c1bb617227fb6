net: always inline net_secret_init

Currently net_secret_init does not get inlined, so we always have a call
to net_secret_init even in the fast path.

Let's specify net_secret_init as __always_inline so we have the nop in
the fast-path without the call to net_secret_init and the unlikely path
at the epilogue of the function.

jump_labels handle the inlining correctly.
