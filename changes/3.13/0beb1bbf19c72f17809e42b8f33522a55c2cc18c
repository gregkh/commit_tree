rt2x00: rt2800lib: fix VGC adjustment for RT5592

In commit 3d81535ea5940446510a8a5cee1c6ad23c90c753
(rt2800: 5592: add chip specific vgc calculations)
the rt2800_link_tuner function has been modified to
adjust VGC level for the RT5592 chipset.

On the RT5592 chipset, the VGC level must be adjusted
only if rssi is greater than -65. However the current
code adjusts the VGC value by 0x10 regardless of the
actual chipset if the rssi value is between -80 and
-65.

Fix the broken behaviour by reordering the if-else
statements.
