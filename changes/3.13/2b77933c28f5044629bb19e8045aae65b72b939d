sparc64: Move to 64-bit PGDs and PMDs.

To make the page tables compact, we were using 32-bit PGDs and PMDs.
We only had to support <= 43 bits of physical addresses so this was
quite feasible.

In order to support larger physical addresses we have to move to
64-bit PGDs and PMDs.

Most of the changes are straight-forward:

1) {pgd,pmd}_t --> unsigned long

2) Anything that tries to use plain "unsigned int" types with pgd/pmd
   values needs to be adjusted.  In particular things like "0U" become
   "0UL".

3) {PGDIR,PMD}_BITS decrease by one.

4) In the assembler page table walkers, use "ldxa" instead of "lduwa"
   and adjust the low bit masks to clear out the low 3 bits instead of
   just the low 2 bits during pgd/pmd address formation.

Also, use PTRS_PER_PGD and PTRS_PER_PMD in the sizing of the
swapper_{pg_dir,low_pmd_dir} arrays.

This patch does not try to take advantage of having 64-bits in the
PMDs to simplify the hugepage code, that will come in a subsequent
change.
