KVM: Drop FOLL_GET in GUP when doing async page fault

Page pinning is not mandatory in kvm async page fault processing since
after async page fault event is delivered to a guest it accesses page once
again and does its own GUP.  Drop the FOLL_GET flag in GUP in async_pf
code, and do some simplifying in check/clear processing.
