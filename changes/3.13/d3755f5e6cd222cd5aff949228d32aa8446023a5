tty: xuartps: Force enable the UART in xuartps_console_write

It is possible that under certain circumstances xuartps_console_write is entered
while the UART disabled. When this happens the code will busy loop in
xuartps_console_putchar, since the character is never written and the TXEMPTY
flag is never set. The result is a system lockup. This patch force enables the
UART for the duration of xuartps_console_write to avoid this.
