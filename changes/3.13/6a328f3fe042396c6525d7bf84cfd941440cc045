sparc64: merge fix

After merging the final tree, today's linux-next build (sparc64 defconfig)
failed like this:

arch/sparc/mm/init_64.c: In function 'pte_alloc_one':
arch/sparc/mm/init_64.c:2568:9: error: unused variable 'pte' [-Werror=unused-variable]

Caused by the merge between commit 37b3a8ff3e08 ("sparc64: Move from 4MB
to 8MB huge pages") and commit 1ae9ae5f7df7 ("sparc: handle
pgtable_page_ctor() fail") (I had the following merge fix in linux-next,
but it didn't seem to propagate upstream - may have forgotten to point it
out :-().
