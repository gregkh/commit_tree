drivers: misc: bmp085: remove '__init' from mp085_get_of_properties()

bmp085_get_of_properties() is called by bmp085_init_client() which is
called by bmp085_probe() which is an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL function.

bmp085_probe() is really used as a probe function by another modules
(e.g. bmp085-i2c.c, bmp085-spi.c).

Except bmp085_get_of_properties(), all functions have no '__init', so
need remove '__init' from bmp085_get_of_properties() too, or at least,
it will report related warning:

  WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x4c8a07): Section mismatch in reference from the variable .LM171 to the variable .init.text:_bmp085_get_of_properties
  The function .LM171() references
  the variable __init _bmp085_get_of_properties.
  This is often because .LM171 lacks a __init
  annotation or the annotation of _bmp085_get_of_properties is wrong.
