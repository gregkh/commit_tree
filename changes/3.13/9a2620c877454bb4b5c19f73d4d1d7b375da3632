bnx2x: prevent WARN during driver unload

Starting with commit 80c33dd "net: add might_sleep() call to napi_disable"
bnx2x fails the might_sleep tests causing a stack trace to appear whenever
the driver is unloaded, as local_bh_disable() is being called before
napi_disable().

This changes the locking schematics related to CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL,
preventing the need for calling local_bh_disable() and thus eliminating
the issue.
