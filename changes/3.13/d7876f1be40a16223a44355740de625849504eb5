KVM: x86: prevent setting unsupported XSAVE states

A guest can still attempt to save and restore XSAVE states even if they
have been masked in CPUID leaf 0Dh.  This usually is not visible to
the guest, but is still wrong: "Any attempt to set a reserved bit (as
determined by the contents of EAX and EDX after executing CPUID with
EAX=0DH, ECX= 0H) in XCR0 for a given processor will result in a #GP
exception".

The patch also performs the same checks as __kvm_set_xcr in KVM_SET_XSAVE.
This catches migration from newer to older kernel/processor before the
guest starts running.
