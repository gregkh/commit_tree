arm64: big-endian: don't treat code as data when copying sigret code

Currently the sigreturn compat code is copied to an offset in the
vectors table. When using a BE kernel this data will be stored in the
wrong endianess so when returning from a signal on a 32-bit BE system,
arbitrary code will be executed.

Instead of declaring the code inside a struct and copying that, use
the assembler's .byte directives to store the code in the correct
endianess regardless of platform endianess.
