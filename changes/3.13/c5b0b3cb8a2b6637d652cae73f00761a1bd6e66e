[media] radio-shark: remove a warning when CONFIG_PM is not defined

On alpha, allyesconfig doesn't have CONFIG_PM, and produces the following warnings:
	drivers/media/radio/radio-shark.c:274:13: warning: 'shark_resume_leds' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
	drivers/media/radio/radio-shark2.c:240:13: warning: 'shark_resume_leds' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
That's because those functions are used only at device resume.
