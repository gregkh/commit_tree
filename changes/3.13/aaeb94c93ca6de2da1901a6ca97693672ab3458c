staging: ft1000: function request_code_segment extracted

function scram_dnldr in ft1000_download.c is very long and contains many
coding style errors and best practice violations. It consists of nested
switch statements inside a while loop. One of the inner switch cases has
been extracted as a helper function. Also, some style errors (such as
C99 comments) have been fixed, an assignment to an unread variable has
been removed, and break statements inside ifs have been converted to
returns.
