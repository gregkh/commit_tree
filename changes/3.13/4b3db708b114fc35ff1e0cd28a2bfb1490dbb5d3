ACPI, x86: Extended error log driver for x86 platform

This H/W error log driver (a.k.a eMCA driver) is implemented based on
http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/enhanced-mca-logging-xeon-paper.html

After errors are captured, more detailed platform specific information
can be got via this new enhanced H/W error log driver. Most notably we
can track memory errors back to the DIMM slot silk screen label.
