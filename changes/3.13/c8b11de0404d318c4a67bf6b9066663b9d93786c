iio: at91: introduce touch screen support in iio adc driver

AT91 ADC hardware integrate touch screen support. So this patch add touch
screen support for at91 adc iio driver.
To enable touch screen support in adc, you need to add the dt parameters:
  1. which type of touch are used? (4 or 5 wires), sample period time.
  2. correct pressure detect threshold value.

In the meantime, since touch screen will use a interal period trigger of adc,
so it is conflict to other hardware triggers. Driver will disable the hardware
trigger support if touch screen is enabled.

This driver has been tested in AT91SAM9X5-EK and SAMA5D3x-EK.
