powerpc: Alignment handler shouldn't access VSX registers with TS_FPR

The TS_FPR macro selects the FPR component of a VSX register (the
high doubleword). emulate_vsx is using this macro to get the
address of the associated VSX register. This happens to work on big
endian, but fails on little endian.

Replace it with an explicit array access.
