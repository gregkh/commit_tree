sched/numa: Decide whether to favour task or group weights based on swap candidate relationships

This patch separately considers task and group affinities when searching
for swap candidates during task NUMA placement. If tasks are not part of
a group or the same group then the task weights are considered.
Otherwise the group weights are compared.
