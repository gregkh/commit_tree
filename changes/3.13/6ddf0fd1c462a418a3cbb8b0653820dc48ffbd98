ALSA: hda - Fix silent output on ASUS W7J laptop

The recent kernels got regressions on ASUS W7J with ALC660 codec where
no sound comes out.  After a long debugging session, we found out that
setting the pin control on the unused NID 0x10 is mandatory for the
outputs.  And, it was found out that another magic of NID 0x0f that is
required for other ASUS laptops isn't needed on this machine.
