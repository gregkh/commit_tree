KVM: ARM: Add support for Cortex-A7

This patch adds support for running Cortex-A7 guests on Cortex-A7 hosts.

As Cortex-A7 is architecturally compatible with A15, this patch is largely just
generalising existing code. Areas where 'implementation defined' behaviour
is identical for A7 and A15 is moved to allow it to be used by both cores.

The check to ensure that coprocessor register tables are sorted correctly is
also moved in to 'common' code to avoid each new cpu doing its own check
(and possibly forgetting to do so!)
