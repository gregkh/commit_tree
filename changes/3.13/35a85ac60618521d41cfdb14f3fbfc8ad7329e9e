drm/i915: Add second slice l3 remapping

Certain HSW SKUs have a second bank of L3. This L3 remapping has a
separate register set, and interrupt from the first "slice". A slice is
simply a term to define some subset of the GPU's l3 cache. This patch
implements both the interrupt handler, and ability to communicate with
userspace about this second slice.

v2:  Remove redundant check about non-existent slice.
Change warning about interrupts of unknown slices to WARN_ON_ONCE
Handle the case where we get 2 slice interrupts concurrently, and switch
the tracking of interrupts to be non-destructive (all Ville)
Don't enable/mask the second slice parity interrupt for ivb/vlv (even
though all docs I can find claim it's rsvd) (Ville + Bryan)
Keep BYT excluded from L3 parity

v3: Fix the slice = ffs to be decremented by one (found by Ville). When
I initially did my testing on the series, I was using 1-based slice
counting, so this code was correct. Not sure why my simpler tests that
I've been running since then didn't pick it up sooner.
