xhci: add argument 'slot_id' in stop_ep, set_deq and reset_ep cmd handlers

Since the Slot ID field in the command completion event matches the Slot ID
field in the associated command TRB for the Stop Endpoint, Set Dequeue Pointer
and Reset Endpoint commands, this patch adds in the handlers of their
completion events a 'slot_id' argument and removes the slot id calculation
in each of them.
Also, a WARN_ON() was added in case the slot ids reported by command TRB and
event TRB differ (although according to xhci spec rev1.0 that should not happen)
