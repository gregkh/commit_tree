netfilter: ipset: Support comments for ipset entries in the core.

This adds the core support for having comments on ipset entries.

The comments are stored as standard null-terminated strings in
dynamically allocated memory after being passed to the kernel. As a
result of this, code has been added to the generic destroy function to
iterate all extensions and call that extension's destroy task if the set
has that extension activated, and if such a task is defined.
