ARM: atomic64: fix endian-ness in atomic.h

Fix inline asm for atomic64_xxx functions in arm atomic.h. Instead of
%H operand specifiers code should use %Q for least significant part
of the value, and %R for the most significant part of the value. %H
always returns the higher of the two register numbers, and therefore
it is not endian neutral. %H should be used with ldrexd and strexd
instructions.
