x86/UV: Add call to KGDB/KDB from NMI handler

This patch restores the capability to enter KDB (and KGDB) from
the UV NMI handler.  This is needed because the UV system
console is not capable of sending the 'break' signal to the
serial console port.  It is also useful when the kernel is hung
in such a way that it isn't responding to normal external I/O,
so sending 'g' to sysreq-trigger does not work either.

Another benefit of the external NMI command is that all the cpus
receive the NMI signal at roughly the same time so they are more
closely aligned timewise.

It utilizes the newly added kgdb_nmicallin function to gain
entry to KGDB/KDB by the master.  The slaves still enter via the
standard kgdb_nmicallback function.  It also uses the new
'send_ready' pointer to tell KGDB/KDB to signal the slaves when
to proceed into the KGDB slave loop.

It is enabled when the nmi action is set to "kdb" and the kernel
is built with CONFIG_KDB enabled.  Note that if kgdb is
connected that interface will be used instead.
