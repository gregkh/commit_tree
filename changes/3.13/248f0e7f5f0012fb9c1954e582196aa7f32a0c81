ARM64: simplify cpu_read_bootcpu_ops using OF/DT helper

Once the cpu_logical_map for any logical cpu is populated with the
corresponding physical identifier(i.e. mpidr), it's device node can
be retrieved using the DT helper 'of_get_cpu_node'. Currently the
device tree parsing code to get boot cpu node is duplicated in
'cpu_read_bootcpu_ops'.

This patch replaces the code parsing the device tree for the boot
cpu with of_get_cpu_node.
