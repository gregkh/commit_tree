HID: sony: Add force feedback support for Dualshock3 USB

Sony Dualshock 3 controllers have two motors which can be used to provide
simple force feedback rumble effects. The right motor is can be used to create
a weak rumble effect but does not allow to set the force. The left motor is
used to create a strong rumble effect with adjustable intensity.

The state of both motors can be changed using HID_OUTPUT_REPORT packets and
have no timing information. FF memless is used to keep track of the timing and
the sony driver just generates the necessary URBs.
