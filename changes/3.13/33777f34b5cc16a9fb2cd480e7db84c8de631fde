Input: fix PWM-related undefined reference errors

This patch adds a PWM dependency to configure the INPUT_MAX8997_HAPTIC
and INPUT_PWM_BEEPER. Without this patch, build system can lead to build
failure. This was observed during randconfig testing, in which
INPUT_MAX8997_HAPTIC or INPUT_PWM_BEEPER was enabled w/o PWM being
enabled, leading to the following errors:

init/built-in.o
