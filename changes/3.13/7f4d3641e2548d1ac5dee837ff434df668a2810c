ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: Don't prevent RESET of USB Host module

Unlike what the comment states, errata i660 does not state that we
can't RESET the USB host module. Instead it states that RESET is the
only way to recover from a deadlock situation.

RESET ensures that the module is in a known good state irrespective
of what bootloader does with the module, so it must be done at boot.
