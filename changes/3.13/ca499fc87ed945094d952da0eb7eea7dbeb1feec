ACPI / hotplug: Fix conflicted PCI bridge notify handlers

The PCI host bridge scan handler installs its own notify handler,
handle_hotplug_event_root(), by itself.  Nevertheless, the ACPI
hotplug framework also installs the common notify handler,
acpi_hotplug_notify_cb(), for PCI root bridges.  This causes
acpi_hotplug_notify_cb() to call _OST method with unsupported
error as hotplug.enabled is not set.

To address this issue, introduce hotplug.ignore flag, which
indicates that the scan handler installs its own notify handler by
itself.  The ACPI hotplug framework does not install the common
notify handler when this flag is set.
