ASoC: fsl: imx-pcm-fiq: omit fiq counter to avoid harm in unbalanced situations

Unbalanced calls to snd_imx_pcm_trigger() may result in endless
FIQ activity and thus provoke eternal sound. While on the first glance,
the switch statement looks pretty symmetric, the SUSPEND/RESUME
pair is not: the suspend case comes along snd_pcm_suspend_all(),
which for fsl/imx-pcm-fiq is called only at snd_soc_suspend(),
but the resume case originates straight from the SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_RESUME.
This way userland may provoke an unbalanced resume, which might cause
the fiq_enable counter to increase and never return to zero again,
so eventually imx_pcm_fiq is never disabled.

Simply removing the fiq_enable will solve the problem, as long as
one never goes play and capture game simultaneously, but beware
trying both at once, the early TRIGGER_STOP will cut off the other
activity prematurely. So now playing and capturing is scrutinized
separately, instead of by counting.
