parisc: fix mmap(MAP_FIXED|MAP_SHARED) to already mmapped address

locale-gen on Debian showed a strange problem on parisc:
mmap2(NULL, 536870912, PROT_NONE, MAP_SHARED, 3, 0) = 0x42a54000
mmap2(0x42a54000, 103860, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED|MAP_FIXED, 3, 0) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

Basically it was just trying to re-mmap() a file at the same address
which it was given by a previous mmap() call. But this remapping failed
with EINVAL.

The problem is, that when MAP_FIXED and MAP_SHARED flags were used, we didn't
included the mapping-based offset when we verified the alignment of the given
fixed address against the offset which we calculated it in the previous call.
