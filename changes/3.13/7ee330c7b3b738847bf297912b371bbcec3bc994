can: c_can: fix calculation of transmitted bytes on tx complete

The number of bytes transmitted was not updated correctly, if several CAN
messages (with different length) were transmitted in one 'bunch'. Thus
programs like 'ifconfig' showed wrong transmit byte counts. Reason was, that
the message object whose DLC is to be read was not necessarily the active one
at the time when

    priv->read_reg(priv, C_CAN_IFACE(MSGCTRL_REG, 0)) & IF_MCONT_DLC_MASK;

was executed.
