drm/i915: make backlight functions take a connector

On VLV/BYT, backlight controls a per-pipe, so when adjusting the
backlight we need to pass the correct info.  So make the externally
visible backlight functions take a connector argument, which can be used
internally to figure out the pipe backlight to adjust.

v2: make connector pipe lookup check for NULL crtc (Jani)
    fixup connector check in ASLE code (Jani)
v3: make sure we take the mode config lock around lookups (Daniel)
v4: fix double unlock in panel_get_brightness (Daniel)
v5: push ASLE work into a work queue (Daniel)
v6: separate ASLE work to a prep patch, rebase (Jani)
