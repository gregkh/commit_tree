bonding: add ip checks when store ip target

I met a Bug when I add ip target with the wrong ip address:

echo +500.500.500.500 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_ip_target

the wrong ip address will transfor to 245.245.245.244 and add
to the ip target success, it is uncorrect, so I add checks to avoid
adding wrong address.

The in4_pton() will set wrong ip address to 0.0.0.0, it will return by
the next check and will not add to ip target.

v2
According Veaceslav's opinion, simplify the code.

v3
According Veaceslav's opinion, add broadcast check and make a micro
definition to package it.

v4
Solve the problem of the format which David point out.
