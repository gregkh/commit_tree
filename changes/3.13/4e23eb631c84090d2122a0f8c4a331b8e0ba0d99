MIPS: ZBOOT: Support XZ compression scheme

Add support for the XZ compression scheme in the ZBOOT decompression
stub, in order to support it we need to:

- select the "xzkern" compression tool to compress the vmlinux.bin
  payload
- link with ashldi3.o for xz_dec_run() to work
- memcpy() is also required for decompress_unxz.c so we share the
  implementation between GZIP and XZ
