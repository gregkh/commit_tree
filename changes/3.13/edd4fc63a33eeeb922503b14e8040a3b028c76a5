drm/msm: rework inactive-work

Re-arrange things a bit so that we can get work requested after a bo
fence passes, like pageflip, done before retiring bo's.  Without any
sort of bo cache in userspace, some games can trigger hundred's of
transient bo's, which can cause retire to take a long time (5-10ms).
Obviously we want a bo cache.. but this cleanup will make things a
bit easier for atomic as well and makes things a bit cleaner.
