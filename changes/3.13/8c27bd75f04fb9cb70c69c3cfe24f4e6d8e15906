tcp: syncookies: reduce cookie lifetime to 128 seconds

We currently accept cookies that were created less than 4 minutes ago
(ie, cookies with counter delta 0-3).  Combined with the 8 mss table
values, this yields 32 possible values (out of 2**32) that will be valid.

Reducing the lifetime to < 2 minutes halves the guessing chance while
still providing a large enough period.

While at it, get rid of jiffies value -- they overflow too quickly on
32 bit platforms.

getnstimeofday is used to create a counter that increments every 64s.
perf shows getnstimeofday cost is negible compared to sha_transform;
normal tcp initial sequence number generation uses getnstimeofday, too.
