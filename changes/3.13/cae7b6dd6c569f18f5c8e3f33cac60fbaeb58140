libfc: Avoid that sending after an abort triggers a kernel warning

Calling fc_seq_send() after an ABTS message has been received triggers
a kernel warning (WARN_ON(!(ep->esb_stat & ESB_ST_SEQ_INIT))). Avoid
this by returning -ENXIO to the caller if fc_seq_send() is invoked after
an ABTS message has been received.
