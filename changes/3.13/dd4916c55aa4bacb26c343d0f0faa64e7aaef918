drm/i915: grab dev->struct_mutex around framebuffer_init

We look at gem state (like obj->tiling/obj->stride), we better have
the relevant locks.

Right now this doesn't matter much since most of these checks are
a curtesy to safe buggy userspace, but I'd like to freeze the tiling
once we have framebuffer objects attached. And then locking matters.
