sysfs: fix sysfs_write_file for bin file

Before patch(sysfs: prepare path write for unified regular / bin
file handling), when size of bin file is zero, writting still can
continue, but this patch changes the behaviour.

The worse thing is that firmware loader is broken by this patch,
and user space application can't write to firmware bin file any more
because both firmware loader and drivers can't know at advance how
large the firmware file is and have to set its initialized size as
zero.

This patch fixes the problem and keeps behaviour of writting to bin
as before.
