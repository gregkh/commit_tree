net: mvmdio: fix interrupt timeout handling

This version corrects the whitespace issue.

orion_mdio_wait_ready uses wait_event_timeout to wait for the
SMI interrupt to fire.  wait_event_timeout waits for between
"timeout - 1" and "timeout" jiffies.  In this case a 1ms timeout
when HZ is 1000 results in a wait of 0 to 1 jiffies, causing
premature timeouts.

This fix ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, ensuring
wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie.
