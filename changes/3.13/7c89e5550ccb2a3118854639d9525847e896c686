cxgb4: Include TCP as protocol when creating server filters

We were creating LE Workaround Server Filters without specifying
IPPROTO_TCP (6) in the filters (when F_PROTOCOL is set in TP_VLAN_PRI_MAP).
This meant that UDP packets with matching IP Addresses/Ports would get
caught up in the filter and be delivered to ULDs like iw_cxgb4.
So, include the protocol information in the server filter properly.
