gpu: host1x: Add 'flags' field to syncpt request

Functions host1x_syncpt_request() and _host1x_syncpt_alloc() have
been taking a separate boolean flag ('client_managed') for indicating
if the syncpoint value should be tracked by the host1x driver.

This patch converts the field into generic 'flags' field so that
we can easily add more information while requesting a syncpoint.
Clients are adapted to use the new interface accordingly.
