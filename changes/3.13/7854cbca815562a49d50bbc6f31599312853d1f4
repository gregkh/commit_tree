KVM: nVMX: Fully support nested VMX preemption timer

This patch contains the following two changes:
1. Fix the bug in nested preemption timer support. If vmexit L2->L0
with some reasons not emulated by L1, preemption timer value should
be save in such exits.
2. Add support of "Save VMX-preemption timer value" VM-Exit controls
to nVMX.

With this patch, nested VMX preemption timer features are fully
supported.
