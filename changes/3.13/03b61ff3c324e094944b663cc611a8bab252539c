mm/memory-failure.c: move set_migratetype_isolate() outside get_any_page()

Chen Gong pointed out that set/unset_migratetype_isolate() was done in
different functions in mm/memory-failure.c, which makes the code less
readable/maintainable.  So this patch does it in soft_offline_page().

With this patch, we get to hold lock_memory_hotplug() longer but it's
not a problem because races between memory hotplug and soft offline are
very rare.
