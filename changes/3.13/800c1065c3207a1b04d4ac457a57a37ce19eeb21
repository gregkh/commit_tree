KVM: s390: Lock kvm->srcu at the appropriate places

The kvm->srcu lock has to be held while accessing the memory of
guests and during certain other actions. This patch now adds
the locks to the __vcpu_run function so that all affected code
is protected now (and additionally to the KVM_S390_STORE_STATUS
ioctl, which can be called out-of-band and needs a separate lock).
