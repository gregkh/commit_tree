ALSA: hda - Delay HDMI presence reports while waiting for ELD information

There is a small gap between the jack detection unsolicited event and
the time the ELD is updated.  When user-space queries the HDMI ELD
immediately after receiving the notification, it might fail because of
this gap.

For avoiding such a problem, this patch tries to delay the HDMI jack
detect notification until ELD information is fully updated.  The
workaround is imperfect, but good enough as a starting point.
