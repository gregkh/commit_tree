mm: fix page_group_by_mobility_disabled breakage

Currently, set_pageblock_migratetype() screws up MIGRATE_CMA and
MIGRATE_ISOLATE if page_group_by_mobility_disabled is true.  It rewrites
the argument to MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE and we lost these attribute.

The problem was introduced by commit 49255c619fbd ("page allocator: move
check for disabled anti-fragmentation out of fastpath").  So a 4 year
old issue may mean that nobody uses page_group_by_mobility_disabled.

But anyway, this patch fixes the problem.
