NFSv4: Sanity check the server reply in _nfs4_server_capabilities

We don't want to be setting capabilities and/or requesting attributes
that are not appropriate for the NFSv4 minor version.

- Ensure that we clear the NFS_CAP_SECURITY_LABEL capability when appropriate
- Ensure that we limit the attribute bitmasks to the mounted_on_fileid
  attribute and less for NFSv4.0
- Ensure that we limit the attribute bitmasks to suppattr_exclcreat and
  less for NFSv4.1
- Ensure that we limit it to change_sec_label or less for NFSv4.2
