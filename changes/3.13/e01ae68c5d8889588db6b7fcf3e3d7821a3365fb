ath10k: check chip id from the soc register during probe

ath10k doesn't support qca988x hw1.0 boards anymore. Unfortunately
the PCI id is the same in hw1.0 and hw2.0 so ath10k tries to use
hw1.0 boards anyway. But without hw1.0 workarounds in place
ath10k just crashes horribly.

To avoid using hw1.0 boards at all add a chip id detection
and fail the probe if hw1.0 is detected:

[ 5265.786408] ath10k: ERROR: qca988x hw1.0 is not supported
[ 5265.786497] ath10k: Unsupported chip id 0x043200ff
[ 5265.786574] ath10k: could not register driver core (-95)
[ 5265.793191] ath10k_pci: probe of 0000:02:00.0 failed with error -95

Also add a warning if there's an unknown chip id but continue
the boot process normally anyway.
