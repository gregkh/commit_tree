sfc: Maintain current frequency adjustment when applying a time offset

There is a single MCDI PTP operation for setting the frequency
adjustment and applying a time offset to the hardware clock.  When
applying a time offset we should not change the frequency adjustment.

These two operations can now be requested separately but this requires
a flash firmware update.  Keep using the single operation, but
remember and repeat the previous frequency adjustment.
