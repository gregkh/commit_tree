UBI: fastmap: fix backward compatibility with image_seq

Some old UBI implementations (e.g. U-Boot) have not implemented the image
sequence feature.
So, when erase blocks are written, the image sequence in the ec header
is lost (set to zero).
UBI scan_all() takes this case into account (commits
32bc4820287a1a03982979515949e8ea56eac641 and
2eadaad67b2b6bd132eda105128d2d466298b8e3)

But fastmap scan functions (ubi_scan_fastmap() and scan_pool()) didn't.

This patch fixes the issue.
