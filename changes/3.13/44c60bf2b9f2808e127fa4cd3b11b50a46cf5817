f2fs: check all ones or zeros bitmap with bitops for better mount performance

Previously, check_block_count check valid_map with bit data type in common
scenario that sit has all ones or zeros bitmap, it makes low mount performance.
So let's check the special bitmap with integer data type instead of the bit one.

v1-->v2:
 o use find_next_{zero_}bit_le for better performance and readable as Jaegeuk
   suggested.
 o use neat logogram in comment as Gu Zheng suggested.
 o search continuous ones or zeros for better performance when checking mixed
   bitmap.
