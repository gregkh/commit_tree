cpufreq: Add dummy cpufreq_cpu_get/put for CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=n

The drm/i915 driver wants to adjust it's own power policies using the
cpu policies as a guideline (we can implicitly boost the cpus through
the gpus on some platforms). To avoid a dreaded select (since a
depends will leave users wondering where where their driver has gone
too) add dummy functions.
