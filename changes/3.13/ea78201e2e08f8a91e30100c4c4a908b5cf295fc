usb: musb: davinci: fix resources passed to MUSB driver for DM6467

After commit 09fc7d22b024692b2fe8a943b246de1af307132b (usb: musb: fix incorrect
usage of  resource pointer), CPPI DMA driver on DaVinci DM6467 can't detect its
dedicated IRQ and so the MUSB IRQ  is erroneously used instead. This is because
only 2 resources are passed to the MUSB driver from the DaVinci glue layer,  so
fix  this by always copying 3 resources (it's  safe since a placeholder for the
3rd resource is always  there) and passing 'pdev->num_resources' instead of the
size of musb_resources[] to platform_device_add_resources().
