bcma: add PCI id 0x4313

This PCI id is used by some BCM4313 cards without a sprom. I have seen
such a card on a router connected to some BCM63XX SoC via PCIe. There
are cards out there with the same PCI id and a BCM4311, which is a pre
ieee80211n chip only supporting ieee80211a, these are still not
supported by b43 and not detected by ssb.
