arch_timer: Move to generic sched_clock framework

Register with the generic sched_clock framework now that it
supports 64 bits. This fixes two problems with the current
sched_clock support for machines using the architected timers.
First off, we don't subtract the start value from subsequent
sched_clock calls so we can potentially start off with
sched_clock returning gigantic numbers. Second, there is no
support for suspend/resume handling so problems such as discussed
in 6a4dae5 (ARM: 7565/1: sched: stop sched_clock() during
suspend, 2012-10-23) can happen without this patch. Finally, it
allows us to move the sched_clock setup into drivers clocksource
out of the arch ports.
