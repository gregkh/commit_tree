sparc64: Add self-IPI support for smp_send_reschedule()

CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL requires possibility of smp_send_reschedule()
for the calling CPU. Currently, it is used in inc_nr_running()
scheduler primitive only.

Nobody calls smp_send_reschedule() from preemptible context
(furthermore, it looks like it will be save if anybody use it
another way in the future). But anyway I add WARN_ON() here
just to return here if anything changes.
