Btrfs: add tests for btrfs_get_extent

I'm going to be removing hole extents in the near future so I wanted to make a
sanity test for btrfs_get_extent to make sure I don't break anything in the
meantime.  This patch just puts btrfs_get_extent through its paces by giving it
a completely unreasonable mapping to look at and make sure it is giving us back
maps that make sense.  Thanks,
