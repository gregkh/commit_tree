diag: warn about missing first netlink attribute

The first netlink attribute (value 0) must always be defined as none/unspec.
This is correctly done in inet_diag.h, but other diag interfaces are wrong.

Because we cannot change an existing API, I add a comment to point the mistake
and avoid to propagate it in a new diag API in the future.
