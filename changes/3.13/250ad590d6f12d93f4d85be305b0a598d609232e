i2c: mux: gpio: use gpio_set_value_cansleep()

Some gpio chips may have get/set operations that
can sleep. gpio_set_value() only works for chips
which do not sleep, for the others we will get a
kernel warning. Using gpio_set_value_cansleep()
will work for both chips that do sleep and those
who don't.
