hotplug / x86: Disable ARCH_CPU_PROBE_RELEASE on x86

Commit d7c53c9e enabled ARCH_CPU_PROBE_RELEASE on x86 in order to
serialize CPU online/offline operations.  Although it is the config
option to enable CPU hotplug test interfaces, probe & release, it is
also the option to enable cpu_hotplug_driver_lock() as well.  Therefore,
this option had to be enabled on x86 with dummy arch_cpu_probe() and
arch_cpu_release().

Since then, lock_device_hotplug() was introduced to serialize CPU
online/offline & hotplug operations.  Therefore, this config option
is no longer required for the serialization.  This patch disables
this config option on x86 and revert the changes made by commit
d7c53c9e.
