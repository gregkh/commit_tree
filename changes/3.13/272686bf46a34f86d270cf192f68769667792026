efi: x86: ia64: provide a generic efi_config_init()

Common to (U)EFI support on all platforms is the global "efi" data
structure, and the code that parses the System Table to locate
addresses to populate that structure with.

This patch adds both of these to the global EFI driver code and
removes the local definition of the global "efi" data structure from
the x86 and ia64 code.

Squashed into one big patch to avoid breaking bisection.
