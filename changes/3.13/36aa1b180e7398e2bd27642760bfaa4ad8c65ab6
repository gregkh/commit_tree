powerpc: PTRACE_PEEKUSR always returns FPR0

There is a bug in using ptrace to access FPRs via PTRACE_PEEKUSR /
PTRACE_POKEUSR. In effect, trying to access any of the FPRs always
really accesses FPR0, which does seriously break debugging :-)

The problem seems to have been introduced by commit 3ad26e5c4459d
(Merge branch 'for-kvm' into next).

[ It is indeed a merge conflict between Paul's FPU/VSX state rework
and my LE patches - Anton ]
