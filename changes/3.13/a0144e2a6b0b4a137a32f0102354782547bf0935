KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Store LPCR value for each virtual core

This adds the ability to have a separate LPCR (Logical Partitioning
Control Register) value relating to a guest for each virtual core,
rather than only having a single value for the whole VM.  This
corresponds to what real POWER hardware does, where there is a LPCR
per CPU thread but most of the fields are required to have the same
value on all active threads in a core.

The per-virtual-core LPCR can be read and written using the
GET/SET_ONE_REG interface.  Userspace can can only modify the
following fields of the LPCR value:

DPFD	Default prefetch depth
ILE	Interrupt little-endian
TC	Translation control (secondary HPT hash group search disable)

We still maintain a per-VM default LPCR value in kvm->arch.lpcr, which
contains bits relating to memory management, i.e. the Virtualized
Partition Memory (VPM) bits and the bits relating to guest real mode.
When this default value is updated, the update needs to be propagated
to the per-vcore values, so we add a kvmppc_update_lpcr() helper to do
that.
