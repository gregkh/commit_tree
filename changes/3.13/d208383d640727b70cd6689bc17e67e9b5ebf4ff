Squashfs: add multi-threaded decompression using percpu variable

Add a multi-threaded decompression implementation which uses
percpu variables.

Using percpu variables has advantages and disadvantages over
implementations which do not use percpu variables.

Advantages:
  * the nature of percpu variables ensures decompression is
    load-balanced across the multiple cores.
  * simplicity.

Disadvantages: it limits decompression to one thread per core.
