mfd: arizona: Mark missing AOD registers as volatile

This registers ARIZONA_AOD_WKUP_AND_TRIG and ARIZONA_AOD_IRQ_RAW_STATUS
contain interrupt status bits and thus should be volatile. They are
correctly marked on wm5102 but not on wm5110, this patch changes this.
Furthermore volatile registers don't need defaults so remove those.
