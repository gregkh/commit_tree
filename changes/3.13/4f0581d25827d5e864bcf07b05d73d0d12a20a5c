xen-netback: improve ring effeciency for guest RX

There was a bug that netback routines netbk/xenvif_skb_count_slots and
netbk/xenvif_gop_frag_copy disagreed with each other, which caused
netback to push wrong number of responses to netfront, which caused
netfront to eventually crash. The bug was fixed in 6e43fc04a
("xen-netback: count number required slots for an skb more carefully").

Commit 6e43fc04a focused on backport-ability. The drawback with the
existing packing scheme is that the ring is not used effeciently, as
stated in 6e43fc04a.

skb->data like:
    |        1111|222222222222|3333        |

is arranged as:
    |1111        |222222222222|3333        |

If we can do this:
    |111122222222|22223333    |
That would save one ring slot, which improves ring effeciency.

This patch effectively reverts 6e43fc04a. That patch made count_slots
agree with gop_frag_copy, while this patch goes the other way around --
make gop_frag_copy agree with count_slots. The end result is that they
still agree with each other, and the ring is now arranged like:
    |111122222222|22223333    |

The patch that improves packing was first posted by Xi Xong and Matt
Wilson. I only rebase it on top of net-next and rewrite commit message,
so I retain all their SoBs. For more infomation about the original bug
please refer to email listed below and commit message of 6e43fc04a.
