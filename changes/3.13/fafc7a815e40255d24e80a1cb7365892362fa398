dm thin: switch to read only mode if a mapping insert fails

Switch the thin pool to read-only mode when dm_thin_insert_block() fails
since there is little reason to expect the cause of the failure to be
resolved without further action by user space.

This issue was noticed with the device-mapper-test-suite using:
dmtest run --suite thin-provisioning -n /exhausting_metadata_space_causes_fail_mode/

The quantity of errors logged in this case must be reduced.
