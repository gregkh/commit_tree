mm: clear N_CPU from node_states at CPU offline

vmstat_cpuup_callback() is a CPU notifier callback, which marks N_CPU to a
node at CPU online event.  However, it does not update this N_CPU info at
CPU offline event.

Changed vmstat_cpuup_callback() to clear N_CPU when the last CPU in the
node is put into offline, i.e.  the node no longer has any online CPU.
