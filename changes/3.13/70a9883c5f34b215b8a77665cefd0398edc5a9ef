xfs: create a shared header file for format-related information

All of the buffer operations structures are needed to be exported
for xfs_db, so move them all to a common location rather than
spreading them all over the place. They are verifying the on-disk
format, so while xfs_format.h might be a good place, it is not part
of the on disk format.

Hence we need to create a new header file that we centralise these
related definitions. Start by moving the bffer operations
structures, and then also move all the other definitions that have
crept into xfs_log_format.h and xfs_format.h as there was no other
shared header file to put them in.
