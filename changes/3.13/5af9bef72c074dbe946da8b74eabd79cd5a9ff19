md/raid5: fix a recently broken BUG_ON().

commit 6d183de4077191d1201283a9035ce57a9b05254d
    md/raid5: fix newly-broken locking in get_active_stripe.

simplified a BUG_ON, but removed too much so now it sometimes fires
when it shouldn't.

When the STRIPE_EXPANDING flag is set, the stripe_head might be on a
special list while multiple stripe_heads are collected, or it might
not be on any list, even a 'free' list when the refcount is zero.  As
long as STRIPE_EXPANDING is set, it will be found and added back to a
list eventually.

So both of the BUG_ONs which test for the ->lru being empty or not
need to avoid the case where STRIPE_EXPANDING is set.

The patch which broke this was marked for -stable, so this patch needs
to be applied to any branch that received 6d183de4
