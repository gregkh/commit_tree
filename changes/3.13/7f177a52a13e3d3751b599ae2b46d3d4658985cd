MIPS: Tell R4k SC and MC variations apart

There is no reliable way to tell R4000/R4400 SC and MC variations apart,
however simple heuristic should give good results.  Only the MC version
supports coherent caching so we can rely on such a mode having been set
for KSEG0 by the power-on firmware to reliably indicate an MC processor.
SC processors reportedly hang on coherent cached memory accesses and Linux
is linked to a cached load address so the firmware has to use the correct
caching mode to download the kernel image in a cached mode successfully.

OTOH if the firmware chooses to use either the non-coherent cached or the
uncached mode for KSEG0 on an MC processor, then the SC variant will be
reported, just as we currently do, so no regression here.
