serial: imx: optimization: remove the workqueues for DMA

I worried that the delay of the sdma_run_channel0() maybe too long for
interrupt context, so I added the workqueues for RX/TX DMA.

But tested with bluetooth device, I find that the delay of sdma_run_channel0()
is about 8us (tested in imx6dl sabreauto board). I think the delay
is acceptable.

This patch removes the RX/TX workqueues for DMA, it makes the
code more clear.
