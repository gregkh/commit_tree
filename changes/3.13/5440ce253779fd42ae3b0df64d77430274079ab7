ath10k: prevent CE from looping indefinitely

The double while() could end up running forever.
Inner while() would complete very fast. However
the completion processing could take enough time
for more completions to flow in. In that case the
outer while() would not terminate and run again,
and again. This could happen especially on a slow
host system.

This could lead to a system freeze during heavy
traffic. Note: this doesn't solve all known
starvation issues yet.
