tty: xuartps: Updating set_baud_rate()

The original algorithm to find the best baud rate dividers does not necessarily
find the best set of dividers. And in the worst case may even write illegal
values to the hardware.
The new function should make better use of the hardware capabilities and be able
to provide valid settings for a wider range of baud rates and also input clocks.
