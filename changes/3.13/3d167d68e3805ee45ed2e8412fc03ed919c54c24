KEYS: Split public_key_verify_signature() and make available

Modify public_key_verify_signature() so that it now takes a public_key struct
rather than a key struct and supply a wrapper that takes a key struct.  The
wrapper is then used by the asymmetric key subtype and the modified function is
used by X.509 self-signature checking and can be used by other things also.
