audit: use memset instead of trying to initialize field by field

We currently are setting fields to 0 to initialize the structure
declared on the stack.  This is a bad idea as if the structure has holes
or unpacked space these will not be initialized.  Just use memset.  This
is not a performance critical section of code.
