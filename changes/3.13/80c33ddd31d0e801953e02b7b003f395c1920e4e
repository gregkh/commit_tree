net: add might_sleep() call to napi_disable

napi_disable uses an msleep() call to wait for outstanding napi work to be
finished after setting the disable bit. It does not always sleep incase there
was no outstanding work. This resulted in a rare bug in ixgbe_down operation
where a napi_disable call took place inside of a local_bh_disable()d context.
In order to enable easier detection of future sleep while atomic BUGs, this
patch adds a might_sleep() call, so that every use of napi_disable during
atomic context will be visible.
