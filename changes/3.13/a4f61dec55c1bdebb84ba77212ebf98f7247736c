x86, trace: Change user|kernel_page_fault to page_fault_user|kernel

Tracepoints are named hierachially, and it makes more sense to keep a
general flow of information level from general to specific from left
to right, i.e.

	x86_exceptions.page_fault_user|kernel

rather than

	x86_exceptions.user|kernel_page_fault
