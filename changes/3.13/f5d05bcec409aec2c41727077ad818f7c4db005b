tools/perf: Support sorting by in_tx or abort branch flags

Extend the perf branch sorting code to support sorting by in_tx
or abort_tx qualifiers. Also print out those qualifiers.

This also fixes up some of the existing sort key documentation.

We do not support no_tx here, because it's simply not showing
the in_tx flag.
