ARM/ARM64: KVM: Implement KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET ioctl

For implementing CPU=host, we need a mechanism for querying
preferred VCPU target type on underlying Host.

This patch implements KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET vm ioctl which
returns struct kvm_vcpu_init instance containing information
about preferred VCPU target type and target specific features
available for it.
