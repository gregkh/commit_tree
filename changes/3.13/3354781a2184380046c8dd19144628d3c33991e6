sched/numa: Reflow task_numa_group() to avoid a compiler warning

Reflow the function a bit because GCC gets confused:

  kernel/sched/fair.c: In function ‘task_numa_fault’:
  kernel/sched/fair.c:1448:3: warning: ‘my_grp’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  kernel/sched/fair.c:1463:27: note: ‘my_grp’ was declared here
