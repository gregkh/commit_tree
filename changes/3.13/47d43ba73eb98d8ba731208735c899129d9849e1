PM / OPP: rename data structures to dev_pm equivalents

Since Operating Performance Points (OPP) data structures are specific
to device specific power management, be specific and rename opp_* data
structures in OPP library with dev_pm_opp_* equivalent.

Affected structures are:
 struct opp
 enum opp_event

Minor checkpatch warning resulting of this change was fixed as well.
