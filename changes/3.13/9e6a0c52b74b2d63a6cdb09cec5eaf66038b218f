Btrfs: stop committing the transaction so much during relocate

I noticed with my horrible snapshot excercisor that we were taking forever to
relocate the larger the file system got.  This appeared to be because we were
committing the transaction _constantly_.  There were a few places where we do
braindead things with metadata reservation, like start a transaction and then
try to refill the block rsv, which not only keeps us from committing a
transaction during the enospc stuff, but keeps us from doing some of the harder
flushing work which will make us more likely to need to commit the transaction.
We also were checking the block rsv and committing the transaction if the block
rsv was below a certain threshold, but we were doing this in a place where we
don't actually keep anything in the block rsv so this was always ending up false
so we always committed the transaction in this case.  I tested this to make sure
it didn't break anything, but it takes about 10 hours to get the box to this
state so I don't know how much of an impact it will really make.  Thanks,
