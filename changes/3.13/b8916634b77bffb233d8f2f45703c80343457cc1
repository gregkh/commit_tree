mm: Prevent parallel splits during THP migration

THP migrations are serialised by the page lock but on its own that does
not prevent THP splits. If the page is split during THP migration then
the pmd_same checks will prevent page table corruption but the unlock page
and other fix-ups potentially will cause corruption. This patch takes the
anon_vma lock to prevent parallel splits during migration.
