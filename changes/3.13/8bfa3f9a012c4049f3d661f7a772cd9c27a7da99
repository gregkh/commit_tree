mm/huge_memory.c: fix stale comments of transparent_hugepage_flags

Since commit 13ece886d99c ("thp: transparent hugepage config choice"),
transparent hugepage support is disabled by default, and
TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ALWAYS is configured when TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y.

And since commit d39d33c332c6 ("thp: enable direct defrag"), defrag is
enable for all transparent hugepage page faults by default, not only in
MADV_HUGEPAGE regions.
