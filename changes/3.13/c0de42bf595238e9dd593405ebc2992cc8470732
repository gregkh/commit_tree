ASoC: dmaengine-pcm: Add support for querying DMA capabilities

Currently each platform making use the the generic dmaengine PCM driver still
needs to provide a custom snd_pcm_hardware struct which specifies the
capabilities of the DMA controller, e.g. the maximum period size that can be
supported. This patch adds code which uses the newly introduced
dma_get_slave_caps() API to query this information from the dmaengine driver.
The new code path will only be taken if the 'pcm_hardware' field of the
snd_dmaengine_pcm_config struct is NULL.

The patch also introduces a new 'fifo_size' field to the
snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data struct which is used to initialize the
snd_pcm_hardware 'fifo_size' field and needs to be set by the DAI driver.
