ceph: handle frag mismatch between readdir request and reply

If client has outdated directory fragments information, it may request
readdir an non-existent directory fragment. In this case, the MDS finds
an approximate directory fragment and sends its contents back to the
client. When receiving a reply with fragment that is different than the
requested one, the client need to reset the 'readdir offset'.
