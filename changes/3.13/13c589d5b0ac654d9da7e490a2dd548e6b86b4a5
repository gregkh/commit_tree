sysfs: use seq_file when reading regular files

sysfs read path implements its own buffering scheme between userland
and kernel callbacks, which essentially is a degenerate duplicate of
seq_file.  This patch replaces the custom read buffering
implementation in sysfs with seq_file.

While the amount of code reduction is small, this reduces low level
hairiness and enables future development of a new versatile API based
on seq_file so that sysfs features can be shared with other
subsystems.

As write path was already converted to not use sysfs_open_file->page,
this patch makes ->page and ->count unused and removes them.

Userland behavior remains the same except for some extreme corner
cases - e.g. sysfs will now regenerate the content each time a file is
read after a non-contiguous seek whereas the original code would keep
using the same content.  While this is a userland visible behavior
change, it is extremely unlikely to be noticeable and brings sysfs
behavior closer to that of procfs.
