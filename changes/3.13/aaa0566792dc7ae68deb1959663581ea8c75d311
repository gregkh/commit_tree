drm/i915: Don't destroy the vma placeholder during execbuffer reservation

The execbuffer handle and exec_link were moved from the object into the
vma. As the vma may be unbound and destroyed whilst attempting to
reserve the execbuffer objects (either through a forced unbind to fix up
a misalignment or through an evict-everything call) we need to prevent
the free of the i915_vma itself. Otherwise not only is the list of
objects to reserve corrupt, but we continue to reference stale vma
entries.

Fixes kernel crash with i-g-t/gem_evict_everything
