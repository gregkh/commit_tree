ARM: 7852/1: cmpxchg: implement barrier-less cmpxchg64_local

Our cmpxchg64 macros are wrappers around atomic64_cmpxchg. Whilst this is
great for code re-use, there is a case for barrier-less cmpxchg where it
is known to be safe (for example cmpxchg64_local and cmpxchg-based
lockrefs).

This patch introduces a 64-bit cmpxchg implementation specifically
for the cmpxchg64_* macros, so that it can be later used by the lockref
code.
