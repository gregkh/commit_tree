x86, mm: do not leak page->ptl for pmd page tables

There are two code paths how page with pmd page table can be freed:
pmd_free() and pmd_free_tlb().

I've missed the second one and didn't add page table destructor call
there.  It leads to leak of page->ptl for pmd page tables, if
dynamically allocated page->ptl is in use.

The patch adds the missed destructor and modifies documentation
accordingly.
