mm: memcg: do not declare OOM from __GFP_NOFAIL allocations

Commit 84235de394d9 ("fs: buffer: move allocation failure loop into the
allocator") started recognizing __GFP_NOFAIL in memory cgroups but
forgot to disable the OOM killer.

Any task that does not fail allocation will also not enter the OOM
completion path.  So don't declare an OOM state in this case or it'll be
leaked and the task be able to bypass the limit until the next
userspace-triggered page fault cleans up the OOM state.
