staging: comedi: s626: remove PCI ID defines

The Sensoray 626 is based on the Philips SAA7146 chip using the Philips
vendor and device ID for the chip, but with custom subdevice and
subvendor IDs.  Use the Philips IDs in the PCI device table and replace
the macros for the subvendor and subdevice IDs with open-coded values.
