mtd: nand: hack ONFI for non-power-of-2 dimensions

Some bright specification writers decided to write this in the ONFI spec
(from ONFI 3.0, Section 3.1):

  "The number of blocks and number of pages per block is not required to
  be a power of two. In the case where one of these values is not a
  power of two, the corresponding address shall be rounded to an
  integral number of bits such that it addresses a range up to the
  subsequent power of two value. The host shall not access upper
  addresses in a range that is shown as not supported."

This breaks every assumption MTD makes about NAND block/chip-size
dimensions -- they *must* be a power of two!

And of course, an enterprising manufacturer has made use of this lovely
freedom. Exhibit A: Micron MT29F32G08CBADAWP

  "- Plane size: 2 planes x 1064 blocks per plane
   - Device size: 32Gb: 2128 blockss [sic]"

This quickly hits a BUG() in nand_base.c, since the extra dimensions
overflow so we think it's a second chip (on my single-chip setup):

    ONFI param page 0 valid
    ONFI flash detected
    NAND device: Manufacturer ID: 0x2c, Chip ID: 0x44 (Micron MT29F32G08CBADAWP), 4256MiB, page size: 8192, OOB size: 744

So to fix this, just truncate these dimensions down to the greatest
power-of-2 dimension that is less than or equal to the specified
dimension.
