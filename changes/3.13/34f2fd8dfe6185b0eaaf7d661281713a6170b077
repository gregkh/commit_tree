bio: fix argument of __bio_add_page() for max_sectors > 0xffff

The data type of max_sectors and max_hw_sectors in queue settings are
unsigned int.  But these values are passed to __bio_add_page() as an
argument whose data type is unsigned short.  In the worst case such as
max_sectors is 0x10000, bio_add_page() can't add a page and IOs can't
proceed.
