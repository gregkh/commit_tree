ALSA: hda - Don't clear the power state at snd_hda_codec_reset()

snd_hda_codec_reset() is called either in resetting the whole setup at
error paths or hwdep clear/reconfig sysfs triggers.  But all of these
don't assume that the power has to be off, rather they want to keep
the power state unchanged (e.g. reconfig_codec() calls the power
up/down by itself).  Thus, unconditionally clearing the power state in
snd_hda_codec_reset() leads to the inconsistency, confuses the further
operation.   This patch gets rid of the lines doing that bad thing.
