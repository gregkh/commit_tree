usb: hub: Use correct reset for wedged USB3 devices that are NOTATTACHED

This patch adds a check for USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED to the
hub_port_warm_reset_required() workaround for ports that end up in
Compliance Mode in hub_events() when trying to decide which reset
function to use. Trying to call usb_reset_device() with a NOTATTACHED
device will just fail and leave the port broken.
