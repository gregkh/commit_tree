IPoIB: Fix usage of uninitialized multicast objects

The driver should avoid calling ib_sa_free_multicast on the mcast->mc
object until it finishes its initialization state.  Otherwise we can
crash when ipoib_mcast_dev_flush() attempts to use the uninitialized
multicast object.

Instead, only call wait_for_completion() for multicast entries that
started the join process, meaning that ib_sa_join_multicast() finished.
