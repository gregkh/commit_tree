ACPI / hotplug: Fix handle_root_bridge_removal()

It is required to do get_device() on the struct acpi_device in
question before passing it to acpi_bus_hot_remove_device() through
acpi_os_hotplug_execute(), because acpi_bus_hot_remove_device()
calls acpi_scan_hot_remove() that does put_device() on that
object.

The ACPI PCI root removal routine, handle_root_bridge_removal(),
doesn't do that, which may lead to premature freeing of the
device object or to executing put_device() on an object that
has been freed already.

Fix this problem by making handle_root_bridge_removal() use
get_device() as appropriate.
