tracing/events: Add bounce tracing to swiotbl

Ftrace is currently not able to detect when SWIOTLB has to do double buffering.
Under Xen you can only see it indirectly in function_graph, when
xen_swiotlb_map_page() doesn't stop after range_straddles_page_boundary(), but
calls spinlock functions, memcpy() and xen_phys_to_bus() as well. This patch
introduces the swiotlb:swiotlb_bounced event, which also prints out the
following informations to help you find out why bouncing happened:

dev_name: 0000:08:00.0 dma_mask=ffffffffffffffff dev_addr=9149f000 size=32768
swiotlb_force=0

If you use Xen, and (dev_addr + size + 1) > dma_mask, the buffer is out of the
device's DMA range. If swiotlb_force == 1, you should really change the kernel
parameters. Otherwise, the buffer is not contiguous in mfn space.

[v1: Don't print 'swiotlb_force=X', just print swiotlb_force if it is enabled]
