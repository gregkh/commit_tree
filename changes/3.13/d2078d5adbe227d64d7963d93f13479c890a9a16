x86: EFI stub support for large memory maps

This patch fixes a problem with EFI memory maps larger than 128 entries
when booting using the EFI stub, which results in overflowing e820_map
in boot_params and an eventual halt when checking the map size in
sanitize_e820_map().

If the number of map entries is greater than what can fit in e820_map,
add the extra entries to the setup_data list using type SETUP_E820_EXT.
These extra entries are then picked up when the setup_data list is
parsed in parse_e820_ext().
