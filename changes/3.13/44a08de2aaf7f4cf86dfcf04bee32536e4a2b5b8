iommu/arm-smmu: Check for num_context_irqs > 0 to avoid divide by zero exception

With the right (or wrong;-) definition of v1 SMMU node in DTB it is
possible to trigger a division by zero in arm_smmu_init_domain_context
(if number of context irqs is 0):

       if (smmu->version == 1) {
               root_cfg->irptndx = atomic_inc_return(&smmu->irptndx);
 =>            root_cfg->irptndx %= smmu->num_context_irqs;
       } else {

Avoid this by checking for num_context_irqs > 0 when probing
for SMMU devices.
