Revert "arm64: Fix memory shareability attribute for ioremap_wc/cache"

This reverts commit 2f7dc6027522499582a520807cb9ffda589de47e.

The above commit breaks the mapping type for Device memory because
pgprot_default already contains a Normal memory type. pgprot_default is
also not initialised early enough for earlyprintk resulting in an
inconsistent memory mapping with 64K PAGE_SIZE configuration.
