irqchip: renesas-intc-irqpin: Fix register bitfield shift calculation

The SENSE register bitfield position is incorrectly computed for SoCs
that use 2-bit IRQ sense fields. Fix it.

This has been tested on the Marzen (H1) and Bockw (M1) boards.

This bug has been present since the renesas-intc-irqpin driver was
introduced by 443580486e3b9657 ("irqchip: Renesas INTC External IRQ pin
driver") in v3.10-rc1.
