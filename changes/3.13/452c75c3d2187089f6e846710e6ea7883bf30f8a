Btrfs: Simplify the logic in alloc_extent_buffer() for existing extent buffer case

alloc_extent_buffer() uses radix_tree_lookup() when radix_tree_insert()
fails with EEXIST. That part of the code is very similar to the code in
find_extent_buffer(). This patch replaces radix_tree_lookup() and
surrounding code in alloc_extent_buffer() with find_extent_buffer().

Note that radix_tree_lookup() does not need to be protected by
tree->buffer_lock. It is protected by eb->refs.

While at it, this patch
  - changes the other usage of radix_tree_lookup() in alloc_extent_buffer()
    with find_extent_buffer() to reduce redundancy.
  - removes the unused argument 'len' to find_extent_buffer().
