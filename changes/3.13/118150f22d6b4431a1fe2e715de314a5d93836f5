gpio: davinci: move to platform device

Modify DaVinci GPIO driver to become a platform device
driver.

The driver does not have platform driver structure or
a probe. Instead, it has pure_initcall function for
initialization. The platform specific informaiton is
obtained using the DaVinci specific davinci_soc_info
structure. This is a problem for Device Tree (DT)
implementation.

As a first stage of DT conversion, we implement a probe.

Additional notes:

- The driver registration happens as  postcore_initcall.
  This is required since machine init functions like
  da850_lcd_hw_init() make use of GPIO.
- Start using devres APIs for simpler error handling.
