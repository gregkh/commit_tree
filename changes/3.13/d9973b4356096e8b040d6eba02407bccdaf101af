drm/i915: Fix type mismatch and accounting in i915_gem_shrink

The interface uses an unsigned long, and we can use the unsigned counter
throughout our code, so do so. In the process, we notice one instance
where the shrink count is based on a heuristic rather than the result,
and another where we ask for too many pages to be purged.

v2: nr_to_scan needs to be promoted to a long as well, so just use
    sc->nr_to_scan directly.
