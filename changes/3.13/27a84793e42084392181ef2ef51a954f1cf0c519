ARM: smp_on_up: move inline asm ALT_SMP patching macro out of spinlock.h

Patching UP/SMP alternatives inside inline assembly blocks is useful
outside of the spinlock implementation, where it is used for sev and wfe.

This patch lifts the macro into processor.h and gives it a scarier name
to (a) avoid conflicts in the global namespace and (b) to try and deter
its usage unless you "know what you're doing". The W macro for generating
wide instructions when targetting Thumb-2 is also made available under
the name WASM, to reduce the potential for conflicts with other headers.
