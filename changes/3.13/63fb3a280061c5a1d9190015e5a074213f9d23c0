USB: NS_TO_US should round up

Host controller drivers use the NS_TO_US macro to convert transaction
times, which are computed in nanoseconds, to microseconds for
scheduling.  Periodic scheduling requires worst-case estimates, but
the macro does its conversion using round-to-nearest.  This patch
changes it to use round-up, giving a correct worst-case value.
