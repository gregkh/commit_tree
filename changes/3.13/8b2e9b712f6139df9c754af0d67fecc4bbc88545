Revert "mm: create a separate slab for page->ptl allocation"

This reverts commit ea1e7ed33708c7a760419ff9ded0a6cb90586a50.

Al points out that while the commit *does* actually create a separate
slab for the page->ptl allocation, that slab is never actually used, and
the code continues to use kmalloc/kfree.

Damien Wyart points out that the original patch did have the conversion
to use kmem_cache_alloc/free, so it got lost somewhere on its way to me.

Revert the half-arsed attempt that didn't do anything.  If we really do
want the special slab (remember: this is all relevant just for debug
builds, so it's not necessarily all that critical) we might as well redo
the patch fully.
