iscsi-target: Reject unsupported multi PDU text command sequence

This patch adds a check to reject text commands with F_BIT=0 ||
C_BIT=1, as multi PDU text command sequences are currently
unsupported.

This avoids the case where a text command received with F_BIT=0,
was generating a text response with F_BIT=1 which is a protocol
error according to RFC-3720 Section 10.11.1.
