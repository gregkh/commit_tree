cpufreq: Optimize cpufreq_frequency_table_verify()

cpufreq_frequency_table_verify() is rewritten here to make it more logical
and efficient.
 - merge multiple lines for variable declarations together.
 - quit early if any frequency between min/max is found.
 - don't call cpufreq_verify_within_limits() in case any valid freq is
   found as it is of no use.
 - rename the count variable as found and change its type to boolean.
