dm cache: update Documentation for invalidate_cblocks's range syntax

The cache target's invalidate_cblocks message allows cache block
(cblock) ranges to be expressed with: <cblock start>-<cblock end>

The range's <cblock end> value is "one past the end", so the range
includes <cblock start> through <cblock end>-1.
