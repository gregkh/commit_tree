perf: Disable all pmus on unthrottling and rescheduling

Currently, only one PMU in a context gets disabled during unthrottling
and event_sched_{out,in}(), however, events in one context may belong to
different pmus, which results in PMUs being reprogrammed while they are
still enabled.

This means that mixed PMU use [which is rare in itself] resulted in
potentially completely unreliable results: corrupted events, bogus
results, etc.

This patch temporarily disables PMUs that correspond to
each event in the context while these events are being modified.
