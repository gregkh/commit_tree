ext4: remove unreachable code after ext4_can_extents_be_merged()

Commit ec22ba8e ("ext4: disable merging of uninitialized extents")
ensured that if either extent under consideration is uninit, we
decline to merge, and ext4_can_extents_be_merged() returns false.

So there is no need for the caller to then test whether the
extent under consideration is unitialized; if it were, we
wouldn't have gotten that far.

The comments were also inaccurate; ext4_can_extents_be_merged()
no longer XORs the states, it fails if *either* is uninit.
