intel_mid: Renamed *mrst* to *intel_mid*

mrst is used as common name to represent all intel_mid type
soc's. But moorsetwon is just one of the intel_mid soc. So
renamed them to use intel_mid.

This patch mainly renames the variables and related
functions that uses *mrst* prefix with *intel_mid*.

To ensure that there are no functional changes, I have compared
the objdump of related files before and after rename and found
the only difference is symbol and name changes.
