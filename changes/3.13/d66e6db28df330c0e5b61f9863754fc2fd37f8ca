PM / Runtime: Respect autosuspend when idle triggers suspend

For devices which don't have a .runtime_idle() callback or if it
returns 0, rpm_idle() will end up in triggering a call to
rpm_suspend(), thus trying to carry out a runtime suspend directly
from runtime_idle().

In the above situation we want to respect devices which has enabled
autosuspend, we therfore append the flag sent to rpm_suspend with
RPM_AUTO.

Do note that drivers still needs to update the device last busy mark,
to control the delay for this circumstance.

Updated runtime PM documentation accordingly.
