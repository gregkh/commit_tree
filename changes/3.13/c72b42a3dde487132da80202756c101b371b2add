perf: Add unlikely() to the ring-buffer code

Add unlikely() annotations to 'slow' paths:

When having a sampling event but no output buffer; you have bigger
issues -- also the bail is still faster than actually doing the work.

When having a sampling event but a control page only buffer, you have
bigger issues -- again the bail is still faster than actually doing
work.

Optimize for the case where you're not loosing events -- again, not
doing the work is still faster but make sure that when you have to
actually do work its as fast as possible.

The typical watermark is 1/2 the buffer size, so most events will not
take this path.

Shrinks perf_output_begin() by 16 bytes on x86_64-defconfig.
