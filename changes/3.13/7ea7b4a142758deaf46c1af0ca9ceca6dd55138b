batman-adv: make the TT CRC logic VLAN specific

This change allows nodes to handle the TT table on a
per-VLAN basis. This is needed because nodes may have to
store only some of the global entries advertised by another
node.

In this scenario such nodes would re-create only a partial
global table and would not be able to compute a correct CRC
anymore.

This patch splits the logic and introduces one CRC per VLAN.
In this way a node fetching only some entries belonging to
some VLANs is still able to compute the needed CRCs and
still check the table correctness.

With this patch the shape of the TVLV-TT is changed too
because now a node needs to advertise all the CRCs of all
the VLANs that it is wired to.

The debug output of the local Translation Table now shows
the CRC along with each entry since there is not a common
value for the entire table anymore.
