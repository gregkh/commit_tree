arm/arm64: KVM: Fix hyp mappings of vmalloc regions

Using virt_to_phys on percpu mappings is horribly wrong as it may be
backed by vmalloc.  Introduce kvm_kaddr_to_phys which translates both
types of valid kernel addresses to the corresponding physical address.

At the same time resolves a typing issue where we were storing the
physical address as a 32 bit unsigned long (on arm), truncating the
physical address for addresses above the 4GB limit.  This caused
breakage on Keystone.
