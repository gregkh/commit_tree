batman-adv: make the TT global purge routine VLAN specific

Instead of unconditionally removing all the TT entries
served by a given originator, make tt_global_orig_del()
remove only entries matching a given VLAN identifier
provided as argument.

If such argument is negative all the global entries
served by the originator are removed.

This change is used into the BLA code to purge entries
served by a newly discovered Backbone node, but limiting
the operation only to those connected to the VLAN where the
backbone has been discovered.
