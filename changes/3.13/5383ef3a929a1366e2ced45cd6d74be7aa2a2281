dm thin: re-establish read-only state when switching to fail mode

If the thin-pool transitioned to fail mode and the thin-pool's table
were reloaded for some reason: the new table's default pool mode would
be read-write, though it will transition to fail mode during resume.

When the pool mode transitions directly from PM_WRITE to PM_FAIL we need
to re-establish the intermediate read-only state in both the metadata
and persistent-data block manager (as is usually done with the normal
pool mode transition sequence: PM_WRITE -> PM_READ_ONLY -> PM_FAIL).
