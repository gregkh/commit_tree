genetlink/pmcraid: use proper genetlink multicast API

The pmcraid driver is abusing the genetlink API and is using its
family ID as the multicast group ID, which is invalid and may
belong to somebody else (and likely will.)

Make it use the correct API, but since this may already be used
as-is by userspace, reserve a family ID for this code and also
reserve that group ID to not break userspace assumptions.

My previous patch broke event delivery in the driver as I missed
that it wasn't using the right API and forgot to update it later
in my series.

While changing this, I noticed that the genetlink code could use
the static group ID instead of a strcmp(), so also do that for
the VFS_DQUOT family.
