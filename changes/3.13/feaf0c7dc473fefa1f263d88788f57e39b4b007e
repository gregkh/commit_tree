KVM: nVMX: Do not generate #DF if #PF happens during exception delivery into L2

If #PF happens during delivery of an exception into L2 and L1 also do
not have the page mapped in its shadow page table then L0 needs to
generate vmexit to L2 with original event in IDT_VECTORING_INFO, but
current code combines both exception and generates #DF instead. Fix that
by providing nVMX specific function to handle page faults during page
table walk that handles this case correctly.
