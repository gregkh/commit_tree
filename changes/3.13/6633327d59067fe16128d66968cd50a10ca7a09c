[media] dvb_demux: fix deadlock in dmx_section_feed_release_filter()

dmx_section_feed_release_filter() locks dvbdmx->mutex and
if the feed is still filtering, it calls feed->stop_filtering(feed).
stop_filtering() is implemented by dmx_section_feed_stop_filtering()
that first of all try to lock the same mutex: dvbdmx->mutex.
That leads to a deadlock.
It does not happen often in practice because all callers of
release_filter() stop filtering by themselves.
So the problem can happen in case of race condition only.
The patch releases dvbdmx->mutex before call to feed->stop_filtering(feed)
and reacquires the mutex after that.
