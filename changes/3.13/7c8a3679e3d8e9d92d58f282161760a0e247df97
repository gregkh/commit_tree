elevator: acquire q->sysfs_lock in elevator_change()

Add locking of q->sysfs_lock into elevator_change() (an exported function)
to ensure it is held to protect q->elevator from elevator_init(), even if
elevator_change() is called from non-sysfs paths.
sysfs path (elv_iosched_store) uses __elevator_change(), non-locking
version, as the lock is already taken by elv_iosched_store().
