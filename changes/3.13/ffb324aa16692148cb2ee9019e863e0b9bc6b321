staging: winbond: Change variable type to bool

The variable Trigger is only assigned the values true and false.
Change its type to bool.

The simplified semantic patch that find this problem is as
follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

@exists@
type T;
identifier b;
@@
- T
+ bool
  b = ...;
  ... when any
  b = \(true\|false\)
