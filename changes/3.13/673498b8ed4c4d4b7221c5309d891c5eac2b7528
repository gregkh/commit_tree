inet: fix NULL pointer Oops in fib(6)_rule_suppress

This changes ensures that the routing entry investigated by the suppress
function actually does point to a device struct before following that pointer,
fixing a possible kernel oops situation when verifying the interface group
associated with a routing table entry.

According to Daniel Golle, this Oops can be triggered by a user process trying
to establish an outgoing IPv6 connection while having no real IPv6 connectivity
set up (only autoassigned link-local addresses).
