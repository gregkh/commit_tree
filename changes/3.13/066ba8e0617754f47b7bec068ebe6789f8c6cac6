Revert "USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-exynos suspend"

This reverts commit fea0896fd36cff487685970bfc36ddd96352d95b.

Manjunath is no longer at Linaro, the email address bounces.  Given
that, and the fact that others have reported problems with these
patches, I'm reverting them until someone from Linaro who can SUPPORT
THEM submits them.

I will no longer accept patches from linaro.com developers unless a
senior Linaro developer has signed off on them, which did not happen
with this patch set.
