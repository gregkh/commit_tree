Revert "HID: wiimote: add LEGO-wiimote VID"

This reverts commit 86b84167d4e67372376a57ea9955c5d53dae232f as it introduced a
VID/PID conflict with its original owner: hid-wiimote got
hid:b0005g*v0000054Cp00000306 added but hid-sony already has this id for the
PS3 Remote (and the ID is oficically assigned to Sony).

Revert the commit to avoid hid-sony regression. David is working on a
bluez patch to force proper ID on the wiimote.
