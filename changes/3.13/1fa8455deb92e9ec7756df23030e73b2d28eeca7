bcache: Fix dirty_data accounting

Dirty data accounting wasn't quite right - firstly, we were adding the key we're
inserting after it could have merged with another dirty key already in the
btree, and secondly we could sometimes pass the wrong offset to
bcache_dev_sectors_dirty_add() for dirty data we were overwriting - which is
important when tracking dirty data by stripe.
