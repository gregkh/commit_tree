vtime: Add HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN Kconfig

With VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN, cputime_t becomes 64-bit. In order
to use that feature, arch code should be audited to ensure there are no
races in concurrent read/write of cputime_t. For example,
reading/writing 64-bit cputime_t on some 32-bit arches may require
multiple accesses for low and high value parts, so proper locking
is needed to protect against concurrent accesses.

Therefore, add CONFIG_HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN which arches can
enable after they've been audited for potential races.

This option is automatically enabled on 64-bit platforms.

Feature requested by Frederic Weisbecker.
