UBIFS: correct data corruption range

With power-cut emulation, it is possible that sometimes no data at all is
corrupted and that confusing messages are printed due to errors in the
computation of data corruption range.

[1] The start of the range should be [0..len-1], not [0..len].
[2] The end of the range should always be at least 1 greater than the start.
