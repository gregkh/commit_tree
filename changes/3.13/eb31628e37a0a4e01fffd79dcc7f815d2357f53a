netfilter: nf_tables: Add support for IPv6 NAT

This patch generalizes the NAT expression to support both IPv4 and IPv6
using the existing IPv4/IPv6 NAT infrastructure. This also adds the
NAT chain type for IPv6.

This patch collapses the following patches that were posted to the
netfilter-devel mailing list, from Tomasz:

* nf_tables: Change NFTA_NAT_ attributes to better semantic significance
* nf_tables: Split IPv4 NAT into NAT expression and IPv4 NAT chain
* nf_tables: Add support for IPv6 NAT expression
* nf_tables: Add support for IPv6 NAT chain
* nf_tables: Fix up build issue on IPv6 NAT support

And, from Pablo Neira Ayuso:

* fix missing dependencies in nft_chain_nat
