drm/i915: Provide a cheap ggtt vma lookup

"We do fairly often lookup the ggtt vma for an obj." - Chris Wilson. As
such, provide a function to offer slightly cheaper access to the vma.
Not performance tested. By my quick estimation it saves at least 3
pointer dereferences from the existing mechanism.

This patch mostly matches code from Chris in
