input: misc: ixp4-beeper: switch to use gpiolib

The platform using this beeper has support for gpiolib, so there
is no point to use the custom gpio_line* API. A strange ambiguity
where a line was first set as input and then driven high was
solved by first driving the line high as output and then switch
it to input.
