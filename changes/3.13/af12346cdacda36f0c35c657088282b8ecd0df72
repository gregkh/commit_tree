mm/vmalloc: revert "mm/vmalloc.c: check VM_UNINITIALIZED flag in s_show instead of show_numa_info"

The VM_UNINITIALIZED/VM_UNLIST flag introduced by f5252e009d5b ("mm:
avoid null pointer access in vm_struct via /proc/vmallocinfo") is used
to avoid accessing the pages field with unallocated page when
show_numa_info() is called.

This patch moves the check just before show_numa_info in order that some
messages still can be dumped via /proc/vmallocinfo.  This patch reverts
commit d157a55815ff ("mm/vmalloc.c: check VM_UNINITIALIZED flag in
s_show instead of show_numa_info");
