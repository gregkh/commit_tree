USB: EHCI: fix sparse errors

This patch fixes several sparse errors in ehci-hcd introduced by
commit 3d091a6f7039 (USB: EHCI: AMD periodic frame list table quirk).
Although the problem fixed by that commit affects only little-endian
systems, the source code has to use types appropriate for big-endian
too.
