ARM: integrator: update defconfig

This updates the integrator defconfig, apart from the usual
re-shuffling of symbols due to restructuring of the kernel Kconfig
this will also:

- Enable IM-PD1 so all hardware is enabled out-of-the-box
- Enable the LEDs class and heartbeat trigger, so that the
  LED driver in plat-versatile/ is compiled.
- Enale some debug code like the CLK debug.
