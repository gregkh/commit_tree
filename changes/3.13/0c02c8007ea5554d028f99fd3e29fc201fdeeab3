of/irq: Rename of_irq_map_* functions to of_irq_parse_*

The OF irq handling code has been overloading the term 'map' to refer to
both parsing the data in the device tree and mapping it to the internal
linux irq system. This is probably because the device tree does have the
concept of an 'interrupt-map' function for translating interrupt
references from one node to another, but 'map' is still confusing when
the primary purpose of some of the functions are to parse the DT data.

This patch renames all the of_irq_map_* functions to of_irq_parse_*
which makes it clear that there is a difference between the parsing
phase and the mapping phase. Kernel code can make use of just the
parsing or just the mapping support as needed by the subsystem.

The patch was generated mechanically with a handful of sed commands.
