mmc: dw_mmc: control card read threshold

Card Read Threshold should be ensured that the card clock does not stop
in the middle of a block of data being transferred from the card to the
Host. Specially, clock stop is allowed in fast transfer such as HS200
or SDR104 mode. And so, it should be enabled.
