libfc: Do not invoke the response handler after fc_exch_done()

While the FCoE initiator driver invokes fc_exch_done() from inside
the libfc response handler, FCoE target drivers typically invoke
fc_exch_done() from outside the libfc response handler. The object
fc_exch.arg points at may disappear as soon as fc_exch_done() has
finished. So it's important not to invoke the response handler
function after fc_exch_done() has finished. Modify libfc such that
this guarantee is provided if fc_exch_done() is invoked from
outside a response handler. This patch fixes a sporadic crash in
FCoE target implementations after a command has been aborted.
