drm/i915: crc support for hsw

hw designers decided to change the CRC registers and coalesce them all
into one. Otherwise nothing changed. I've opted for a new hsw_ version
to grab the crc sample since hsw+1 will have the same crc registers,
but different interrupt source registers. So this little helper
function will come handy there.

Also refactor the display error handler with a neat pipe loop.

v2: Use for_each_pipe.
