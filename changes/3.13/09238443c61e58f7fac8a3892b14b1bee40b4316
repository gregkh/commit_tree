serial: mrst_max3110: Check the irq number before enable/disabe irq in PM hooks

We should check the validity of the irq number before calling
disable_irq() and enable_irq() in the suspend/resume function,
as "max->irq == 0" means the irq is not enabled for max3110
device, otherwise it will hurt device whose irq number is really 0.
