KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Reserve POWER8 space in get/set_one_reg

This reserves space in get/set_one_reg ioctl for the extra guest state
needed for POWER8.  It doesn't implement these at all, it just reserves
them so that the ABI is defined now.

A few things to note here:

- This add *a lot* state for transactional memory.  TM suspend mode,
  this is unavoidable, you can't simply roll back all transactions and
  store only the checkpointed state.  I've added this all to
  get/set_one_reg (including GPRs) rather than creating a new ioctl
  which returns a struct kvm_regs like KVM_GET_REGS does.  This means we
  if we need to extract the TM state, we are going to need a bucket load
  of IOCTLs.  Hopefully most of the time this will not be needed as we
  can look at the MSR to see if TM is active and only grab them when
  needed.  If this becomes a bottle neck in future we can add another
  ioctl to grab all this state in one go.

- The TM state is offset by 0x80000000.

- For TM, I've done away with VMX and FP and created a single 64x128 bit
  VSX register space.

- I've left a space of 1 (at 0x9c) since Paulus needs to add a value
  which applies to POWER7 as well.
