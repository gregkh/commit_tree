powerpc: Fix alignment of secondary cpu spin vars

Commit 5c0484e25ec0 ('powerpc: Endian safe trampoline') resulted in
losing proper alignment of the spinlock variables used when booting
secondary CPUs, causing some quite odd issues with failing to boot on
PA Semi-based systems.

This showed itself on ppc64_defconfig, but not on pasemi_defconfig,
so it had gone unnoticed when I initially tested the LE patch set.

Fix is to add explicit alignment instead of relying on good luck. :)

[ It appears that there is a different issue with PA Semi systems
  however this fix is definitely correct so applying anyway -- BenH
