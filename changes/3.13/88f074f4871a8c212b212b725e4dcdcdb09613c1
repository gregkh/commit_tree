ACPI, CPER: Update cper info

We have a lot of confusing names of functions and data structures in
amongs the the error reporting code.  In particular the "apei" prefix
has been applied to many objects that are not part of APEI.  Since we
will be using these routines for extended error log reporting it will
be clearer if we fix up the names first.
