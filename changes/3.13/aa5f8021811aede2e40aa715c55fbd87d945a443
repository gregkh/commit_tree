drm/i915: Use unsigned long for obj->user_pin_count

At least on linux sizeof(long) == sizeof(void*) and the thinking
is that you can grab about as many references as there's memory.

Doesn't really matter, just a bit of OCD since the fixed size data
type in a pure in-kernel datastructure look off.

v2: Ville asked for an overflow check since no one prevents userspace
from incrementing the pin count forever.

v3: s/INT/LONG/, noticed by Chris.
