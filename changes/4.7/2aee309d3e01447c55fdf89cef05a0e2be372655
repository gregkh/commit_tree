IB/hfi1: Fix deadlock with txreq allocation slow path

A failure in the get_txreq() inline will result in a
slow path retry using __get_txreq().

__get_txreq() attempts to procure the qp s_lock, which
is already held in all callers.

Fix by deleting the s_lock maintenance in __get_txreq()
and add sparse syntax hooks to future proof the code.
