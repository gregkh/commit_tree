MIPS: Add probing & defs for VZ & guest features

Add a few new cpu-features.h definitions for VZ sub-features, namely the
existence of the CP0_GuestCtl0Ext, CP0_GuestCtl1, and CP0_GuestCtl2
registers, and support for GuestID to dialias TLB entries belonging to
different guests.

Also add certain features present in the guest, with the naming scheme
cpu_guest_has_*. These are added separately to the main options bitfield
since they generally parallel similar features in the root context. A
few of these (FPU, MSA, watchpoints, perf counters, CP0_[X]ContextConfig
registers, MAAR registers, and probably others in future) can be
dynamically configured in the guest context, for which the
cpu_guest_has_dyn_* macros are added.
