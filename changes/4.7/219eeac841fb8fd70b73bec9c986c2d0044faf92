staging: lustre: osc: Allow lock to be canceled at ENQ time

A cl_lock can be canceled when it's in CLS_ENQUEUED state.
We can't unuse this kind of lock in lov_lock_unuse() because
it will bring this lock into CLS_NEW state and then confuse
osc_lock_upcall().

Add a regression test case by Alexander Boyko.
