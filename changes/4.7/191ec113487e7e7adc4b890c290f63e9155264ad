spi: pic32-sqi: Remove pic32_sqi_setup and pic32_sqi_cleanup

Current code does not use ctldata at all, so remove spi_set_ctldata call.

spi_setup() will set spi->bits_per_word = 8 if it was not set, so remove
!spi->max_speed_hz checking.

The spi core allows absent of spi->max_speed_hz setting, if it was not set
spi_setup() assigns spi->master->max_speed_hz to it.

spi core allows spi->max_speed_hz > spi->master->max_speed_hz, in this case
spi core will limit the transfer speed to ensure xfer->speed_hz won't
greater than spi->master->max_speed_hz so remove checking if
spi->max_speed_hz is higher than spi->master->max_speed_hz.

As a result, both pic32_sqi_setup() and pic32_sqi_cleanup() can be removed.
