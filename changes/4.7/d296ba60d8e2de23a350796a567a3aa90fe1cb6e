soreuseport: Resolve merge conflict for v4/v6 ordering fix

d894ba18d4e4 ("soreuseport: fix ordering for mixed v4/v6 sockets")
was merged as a bug fix to the net tree.  Two conflicting changes
were committed to net-next before the above fix was merged back to
net-next:
ca065d0cf80f ("udp: no longer use SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU")
3b24d854cb35 ("tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood")

These changes switched the datastructure used for TCP and UDP sockets
from hlist_nulls to hlist.  This patch applies the necessary parts
of the net tree fix to net-next which were not automatic as part of the
merge.
