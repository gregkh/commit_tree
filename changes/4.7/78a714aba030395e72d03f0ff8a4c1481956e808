KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add GICv3 IROUTER register handlers

Since GICv3 supports much more than the 8 CPUs the GICv2 ITARGETSR
register can handle, the new IROUTER register covers the whole range
of possible target (V)CPUs by using the same MPIDR that the cores
report themselves.
In addition to translating this MPIDR into a vcpu pointer we store
the originally written value as well. The architecture allows to
write any values into the register, which must be read back as written.

Since we don't support affinity level 3, we don't need to take care
about the upper word of this 64-bit register, which simplifies the
handling a bit.
