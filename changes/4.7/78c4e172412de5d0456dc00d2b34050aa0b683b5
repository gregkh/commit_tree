Revert "ecryptfs: forbid opening files without mmap handler"

This reverts commit 2f36db71009304b3f0b95afacd8eba1f9f046b87.

It fixed a local root exploit but also introduced a dependency on
the lower file system implementing an mmap operation just to open a file,
which is a bit of a heavy hammer.  The right fix is to have mmap depend
on the existence of the mmap handler instead.
