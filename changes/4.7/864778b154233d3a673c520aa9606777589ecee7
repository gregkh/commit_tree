mm, aout: handle vm_brk failures

vm_brk is allowed to fail but load_aout_binary simply ignores the error
and happily continues.  I haven't noticed any problem from that in real
life but later patches will make the failure more likely because vm_brk
will become killable (resp.  mmap_sem for write waiting will become
killable) so we should be more careful now.

The error handling should be quite straightforward because there are
calls to vm_mmap which check the error properly already.  The only
notable exception is set_brk which is called after beyond_if label.  But
nothing indicates that we cannot move it above set_binfmt as the two do
not depend on each other and fail before we do set_binfmt and alter
reference counting.
