i2c: tegra: Correct error path in probe

Commit 497fbe24987b ("i2c: tegra: enable multi master mode for tegra210")
enables the Tegra I2C 'div_clk' for adapters using the multi-master mode
during the device probe. Although the probe error path was updated to
disable the clock on probe failure, there is one place after calling
tegra_i2c_init() where the clock will not be disabled on failure. Correct
the error path so that the 'div_clk' is disabled if calling
tegra_i2c_init() fails.
