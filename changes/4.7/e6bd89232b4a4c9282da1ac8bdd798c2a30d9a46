qed: Correct default vlan behavior

When no vlan filter is configured, firmware has a configurable
default on whether to pass only untagged packets or all packets
regardless of their tagging. Driver currently doesn't set this
field in the necessary ramrod, causing the default to always be
'receive all'.
