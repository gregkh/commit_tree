thermal: tegra: split tegra_soctherm driver

Split most of the Tegra124 data and code into a Tegra124-specific
file.
Split most of the fuse-related code into a fuse-related source file.
This is in preparation for adding a Tegra210-specific driver in a
future patch.

Beyond the maintainability improvements, this is intended to separate
chip-specific ATE and characterization-related hacks into chip-specific
files, in the hopes that they won't pollute code for other chips.
