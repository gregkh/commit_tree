tracing: Add support for named hist triggers

Allow users to define 'named' hist triggers.  All triggers created
with the same 'name=xxx' option will update the same shared histogram
data.

This expands the hist trigger syntax from this:

    # echo hist:keys=xxx ... [ if filter] > event/trigger

to this:

    # echo hist:name=xxx:keys=xxx ... [ if filter] > event/trigger

Named histograms must use a 'compatible' set of keys and values, which
means each event added to a set of named triggers must have the same
names and types.

Reading the 'hist' file of any of the participating events will
produce the same output as any other participating event, which is to
be expected since they share the same data.
