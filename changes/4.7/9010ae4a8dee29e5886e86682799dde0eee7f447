perf/x86/intel: Update event constraints when HT is off

This patch updates the event constraints for non-PEBS mode for
Intel Broadwell and Skylake processors. When HT is off, each
CPU gets 8 generic counters. However, not all events can be
programmed on any of the 8 counters.  This patch adds the
constraints for the MEM_* events which can only be measured on the
bottom 4 counters. The constraints are also valid when HT is off
because, then, there are only 4 generic counters and they are the
bottom counters.
