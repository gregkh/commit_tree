x86/arch_prctl/64: Remove FSBASE/GSBASE < 4G optimization

As far as I know, the optimization doesn't work on any modern distro
because modern distros use high addresses for ASLR.  Remove it.

The ptrace code was either wrong or very strange, but the behavior
with this patch should be essentially identical to the behavior
without this patch unless user code goes out of its way to mislead
ptrace.

On newer CPUs, once the FSGSBASE instructions are enabled, we won't
want to use the optimized variant anyway.

This isn't actually much of a performance regression, it has no effect
on normal dynamically linked programs, and it's a considerably
simplification. It also removes some nasty special cases from code
that is already way too full of special cases for comfort.
