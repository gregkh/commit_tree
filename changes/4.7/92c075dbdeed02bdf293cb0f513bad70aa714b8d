net: sched: fix tc_should_offload for specific clsact classes

When offloading classifiers such as u32 or flower to hardware, and the
qdisc is clsact (TC_H_CLSACT), then we need to differentiate its classes,
since not all of them handle ingress, therefore we must leave those in
software path. Add a .tcf_cl_offload() callback, so we can generically
handle them, tested on ixgbe.
