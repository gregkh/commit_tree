[media] media: Add obj_type field to struct media_entity

Code that processes media entities can require knowledge of the
structure type that embeds a particular media entity instance in order
to cast the entity to the proper object type. This needs is shown by the
presence of the is_media_entity_v4l2_io and is_media_entity_v4l2_subdev
functions.

The implementation of those two functions relies on the entity function
field, which is both a wrong and an inefficient design, without even
mentioning the maintenance issue involved in updating the functions
every time a new entity function is added. Fix this by adding add an
obj_type field to the media entity structure to carry the information.
