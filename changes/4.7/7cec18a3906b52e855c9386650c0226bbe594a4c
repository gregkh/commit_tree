genirq: Add error code reporting to irq_{reserve,destroy}_ipi

Make these functions return appropriate error codes when something goes
wrong.

Previously irq_destroy_ipi returned void making it impossible to notify
the caller if the request could not be fulfilled. Patch 1 in the series
added another condition in which this could fail in addition to the
existing ones. irq_reserve_ipi returned an unsigned int meaning it could
only return 0 on failure and give the caller no indication as to why the
request failed.

As time goes on there are likely to be further conditions added in which
these functions can fail. These APIs and the IPI IRQ domain are new in
4.6 and the number of existing call sites are low, changing the API now
has little impact on the code, while making it easier for these
functions to grow over time.
