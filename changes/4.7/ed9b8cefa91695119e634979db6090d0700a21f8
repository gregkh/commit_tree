KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add GICv3 MMIO handling framework

Create a new file called vgic-mmio-v3.c and describe the GICv3
distributor and redistributor registers there.
This adds a special macro to deal with the split of SGI/PPI in the
redistributor and SPIs in the distributor, which allows us to reuse
the existing GICv2 handlers for those registers which are compatible.
Also we provide a function to deal with the registration of the two
separate redistributor frames per VCPU.
