s390/cpuinfo: simplify locking and skip offline cpus early

Move the get_online_cpus() and put_online_cpus() to the start and stop
operation of the seqfile ops. This way there is no need to lock cpu
hotplug again and again for each single cpu.

This way we can also skip offline cpus early if we simply use
cpumask_next() within the next operation.
