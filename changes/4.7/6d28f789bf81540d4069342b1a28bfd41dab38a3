KVM: s390: add clear I/O irq operation for FLIC

Introduce a FLIC operation for clearing I/O interrupts for a subchannel.

Rationale: According to the platform specification, pending I/O
interruption requests have to be revoked in certain situations. For
instance, according to the Principles of Operation (page 17-27), a
subchannel put into the installed parameters initialized state is in the
same state as after an I/O system reset (just parameters possibly changed).
This implies that any I/O interrupts for that subchannel are no longer
pending (as I/O system resets clear I/O interrupts). Therefore, we need an
interface to clear pending I/O interrupts.
