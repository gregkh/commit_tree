clk: bcm2835: reorganize bcm2835_clock_array assignment

Reorganize bcm2835_clock_array so that there is no more
need for separate bcm2835_*_data structures to be defined.
Instead the required structures are generated inline via
helper macros.

To allow this to also work for pll alone it was required that
the parent_pll was changed from a pointer to bcm2835_pll_data
to the name of the pll instead.
