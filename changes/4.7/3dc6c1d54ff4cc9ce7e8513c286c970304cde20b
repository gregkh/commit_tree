perf record: Fix crash when kptr is restricted

Before this patch, a simple 'perf record' could fail if kptr_restrict is
set to 1 (for normal user) or 2 (for root):

  # perf record ls
  WARNING: Kernel address maps (/proc/{kallsyms,modules}) are restricted,
  check /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict.

  Samples in kernel functions may not be resolved if a suitable vmlinux
  file is not found in the buildid cache or in the vmlinux path.

  Samples in kernel modules won't be resolved at all.

  If some relocation was applied (e.g. kexec) symbols may be misresolved
  even with a suitable vmlinux or kallsyms file.

  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

This patch skips perf_event__synthesize_kernel_mmap() when kptr is not
available.
