mips: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

pte_alloc_one{_kernel}, pmd_alloc_one allocate PTE_ORDER resp.
PMD_ORDER but both are not larger than 1.  This means that this flag has
never been actually useful here because it has always been used only for
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
