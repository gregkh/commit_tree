scripts/gdb: add a Radix Tree Parser

Linux makes use of the Radix Tree data structure to store pointers
indexed by integer values.  This structure is utilised across many
structures in the kernel including the IRQ descriptor tables, and
several filesystems.

This module provides a method to lookup values from a structure given
its head node.

Usage:

The function lx_radix_tree_lookup, must be given a symbol of type struct
radix_tree_root, and an index into that tree.

The object returned is a generic integer value, and must be cast
correctly to the type based on the storage in the data structure.

For example, to print the irq descriptor in the sparse irq_desc_tree at
index 18, try the following:

 (gdb) print (struct irq_desc)$lx_radix_tree_lookup(irq_desc_tree, 18)
