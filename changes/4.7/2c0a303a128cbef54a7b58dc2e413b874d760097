regulator: core: Fix locking of GPIO list on free

When we acquire a shareable enable GPIO on probe we do so with the
regulator_list_mutex held.  However when we release the GPIOs we do this
immediately after dropping the mutex meaning that the list could become
corrupted.  Move the release into the locked region to avoid this.
