rcutorture: Add irqs-disabled test for call_rcu()

Mutation testing carried out by Iftekhar Ahmed of Oregon State
University showed that rcutorture is failing to test invocations
of call_rcu() having interrupts disabled.  This commit therefore
adds interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations
of call_rcu() (and friends).
