ixgbe: set VLAN spoof checking unconditionally

Previously the PF driver would only set VLAN spoof checking if
the VF had created VLANs. This was done by setting and checking
a counter (vlan_count) whenever a VLAN was created by the VF.
However it is possible for the vlan_count to be !=0 while there are
no VLANs assigned to the VF due to the count incrementing every
time a VLAN 0 is added on ifdown/up, which resulted in VLAN spoofing
always being set for those VFs.

This patch cleans up the logic by unconditionally setting VLAN based on
how the VF is configured (via ip link set ethX vf Y spoofchk on/off).
This change also resolves an issue where the VLAN spoofing can remain
set even after being disabled by the user due to the driver enabling
VLAN spoof checking every time a VLAN is added to the VF, but would
only allow changes in the setting if vlan_count != 0.

Also default_vf_vlan_id and vlans_enabled were removed from the
vf_data_storage structure since they are not being used in the driver.
