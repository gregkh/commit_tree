cgroup: remove redundant cleanup in css_create

When create css failed, before call css_free_rcu_fn, we remove the css
id and exit the percpu_ref, but we will do these again in
css_free_work_fn, so they are redundant.  Especially the css id, that
would cause problem if we remove it twice, since it may be assigned to
another css after the first remove.

tj: This was broken by two commits updating the free path without
    synchronizing the creation failure path.  This can be easily
    triggered by trying to create more than 64k memory cgroups.
