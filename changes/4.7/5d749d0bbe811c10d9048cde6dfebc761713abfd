platform/chrome: cros_ec_dev - Fix security issue

Prevent memory scribble by checking that ioctl buffer size parameters
are sane.
Without this check, on 32 bits system, if .insize = 0xffffffff - 20 and
.outsize the amount to scribble, we would overflow, allocate a small
amounts and be able to write outside of the malloc'ed area.
Adding a hard limit allows argument checking of the ioctl. With the
current EC, it is expected .insize and .outsize to be at around 512 bytes
or less.
