serial: mxs-auart: Use generic uart-has-rtscts DT property

Convert the Freescale MXS AUART driver from using the vendor-specific
"fsl,uart-has-rtscts" to the generic "uart-has-rtscts" DT property, as
documented by the Generic Serial DT Bindings.

The old vendor-specific property is still recognized by the driver for
backwards compatibility, but it is deprecated.
