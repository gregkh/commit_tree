perf tools: Make alias handler to check return value of strbuf

Make alias handler and sq_quote_argv to check the return value of strbuf
APIs.

In sq_quote_argv() calls die(), but this fix handles strbuf failure as a
special case and returns to caller, since the caller - handle_alias()
also has to check the return value of other strbuf APIs and those checks
can be merged to one if() statement.
