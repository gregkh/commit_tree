net: mediatek: fix TX locking

Inside the TX path there is a lock inside the tx_map function. This is
however too late. The patch moves the lock to the start of the xmit
function right before the free count check of the DMA ring happens.
If we do not do this, the code becomes racy leading to TX stalls and
dropped packets. This happens as there are 2 netdevs running on the
same physical DMA ring.
