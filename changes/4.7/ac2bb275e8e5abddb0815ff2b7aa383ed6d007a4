rcutorture: Make rcuperf collect expedited event-trace data

This commit enables ftrace in the rcuperf TREE kernel build and adds
an ftrace_dump() at the end of rcuperf processing.  This data will be
used to measure the actual durations of the expedited grace periods
without the added delays inherent in the kernel-module measurements.
