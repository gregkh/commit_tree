drm/i915: Simplify for_each_fw_domain iterators

As the vast majority of users do not use the domain id variable,
we can eliminate it from the iterator and also change the latter
using the same principle as was recently done for for_each_engine.

For a couple of callers which do need the domain mask, store it
in the domain array (which already has the domain id), then both
can be retrieved thence.

Result is clearer code and smaller generated binary, especially
in the tight fw get/put loops. Also, relationship between domain
id and mask is no longer assumed in the macro.

v2: Improve grammar in the commit message and rename the
    iterator to for_each_fw_domain_masked for consistency.
