lib/mpi: mpi_read_raw_from_sgl(): replace len argument by nbytes

Currently, the nbytes local variable is calculated from the len argument
as follows:

  ... mpi_read_raw_from_sgl(..., unsigned int len)
  {
    unsigned nbytes;
    ...
    if (!ents)
      nbytes = 0;
    else
      nbytes = len - lzeros;
    ...
  }

Given that nbytes is derived from len in a trivial way and that the len
argument is shadowed by a local len variable in several loops, this is just
confusing.

Rename the len argument to nbytes and get rid of the nbytes local variable.
Do the nbytes calculation in place.
