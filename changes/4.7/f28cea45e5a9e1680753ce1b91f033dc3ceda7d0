drm/i915: Split out load time MMIO initialization

According to the new init phases scheme we should have a definite step
in the init sequence where MMIO access is setup, so move the
corresponding code to a separate function. This also has the benefit of
making the error path cleaner both in the new function and in
i915_driver_load()/unload().

No functional change.
