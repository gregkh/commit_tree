fs: define a string representation of the kernel_read_file_id enumeration

A string representation of the kernel_read_file_id enumeration is
needed for displaying messages (eg. pr_info, auditing) that can be
used by multiple LSMs and the integrity subsystem.  To simplify
keeping the list of strings up to date with the enumeration, this
patch defines two new preprocessing macros named __fid_enumify and
__fid_stringify to create the enumeration and an array of strings.
kernel_read_file_id_str() returns a string based on the enumeration.
