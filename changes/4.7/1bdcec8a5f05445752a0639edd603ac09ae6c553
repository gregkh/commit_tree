hv_netvsc: use start_remove flag to protect netvsc_link_change()

netvsc_link_change() can race with netvsc_change_mtu() or
netvsc_set_channels() as these functions destroy struct netvsc_device and
rndis filter. Use start_remove flag for syncronization. As
netvsc_change_mtu()/netvsc_set_channels() are called with rtnl lock held
we need to take it before checking start_remove value in
netvsc_link_change().
