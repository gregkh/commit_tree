thermal/powerclamp: remove cpu whitelist

Powerclamp works by aligning idle time to achieve package level
idle states, aka cstates. As long as one of the package cstates
is available, synchronized idle injection is meaningful.

This patch replaces the CPU whitelist with CPU feature and
package cstate counter check such that we don't have to modify
this whitelist for every new CPU.
