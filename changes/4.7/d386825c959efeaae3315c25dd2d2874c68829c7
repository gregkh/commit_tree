arm64: mm: free __init memory via the linear mapping

The implementation of free_initmem_default() expects __init_begin
and __init_end to be covered by the linear mapping, which is no
longer the case. So open code it instead, using addresses that are
explicitly translated from kernel virtual to linear virtual.
