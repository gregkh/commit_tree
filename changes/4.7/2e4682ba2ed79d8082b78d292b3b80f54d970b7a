KVM: add missing memory barrier in kvm_{make,check}_request

kvm_make_request and kvm_check_request imply a producer-consumer
relationship; add implicit memory barriers to them.  There was indeed
already a place that was adding an explicit smp_mb() to order between
kvm_check_request and the processing of the request.  That memory
barrier can be removed (as an added benefit, kvm_check_request can use
smp_mb__after_atomic which is free on x86).
