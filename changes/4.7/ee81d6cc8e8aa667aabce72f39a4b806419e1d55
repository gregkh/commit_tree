ata: sata_dwc_460ex: use readl/writel_relaxed()

Rename the register access macros and use standard _relaxed()
ops instead of __raw variants with explicit byte swapping.

The original driver used the ppc-specific in/out_le32().  When it
was adapted to other systems, these were added to the driver
under ifdefs.  However, those names are not defined as macros on
ppc, so it ended up replacing them there as well with altered
semantics.  This patch restores the original semantics on ppc and
makes the accesses no less strict on other systems.

Also fixes too many sparse warnings to count.
