EDAC, sb_edac: Readd accidentally dropped Broadwell-D support

In commit

  2c1ea4c700af ("EDAC, sb_edac: Use cpu family/model in driver detection")

we switched from using PCI ids to determine which platform we are
running on to using CPU model instead.

I forgot that Broadwell-DE has its own distinct model number different
from Broadwell-EP or -EX.

Fixing this isn't just adding a line to the array of cpuids - the
exising code assumed a 1:1 mapping between entries in that array and the
"enum type" values. Added the type to pci_id_table structure to remove
this dependency and allows two Broadwell cpu models.
