clocksource: arm_arch_timer: Gather KVM specific information in a structure

Introduce a structure which are filled up by the arch timer driver and
used by the virtual timer in KVM.

The first member of this structure will be the timecounter. More members
will be added later.

A stub for the new helper isn't introduced because KVM requires the arch
timer for both ARM64 and ARM32.

The function arch_timer_get_timecounter is kept for the time being and
will be dropped in a subsequent patch.
