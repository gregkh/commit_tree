arm64: vhe: Verify CPU Exception Levels

With a VHE capable CPU, kernel can run at EL2 and is a decided at early
boot. If some of the CPUs didn't start it EL2 or doesn't have VHE, we
could have CPUs running at different exception levels, all in the same
kernel! This patch adds an early check for the secondary CPUs to detect
such situations.

For each non-boot CPU add a sanity check to make sure we don't have
different run levels w.r.t the boot CPU. We save the information on
whether the boot CPU is running in hyp mode or not and ensure the
remaining CPUs match it.
