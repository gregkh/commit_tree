drm/i915/shrinker: Only shmemfs objects are backed by swap

Since we can only swap out shmemfs objects, those are the only ones that
can influence the ability of the shrinker to free pages. Currently, all
non-shmemfs objects have a raised pages_pin_count to protect them from
the shrinker, so this just makes the logic for can_release_pages()
clearer (and safer in future so that we don't over estimate our ability
to free up pages from future non-swappable objects).
