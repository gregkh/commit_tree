i2c: rcar: add DMA support

Make it possible to transfer i2c message buffers via DMA.
Start/Stop/Sending_Slave_Address and some data is still handled using
the old state machine, it is sending the bulk of the data that is done
via DMA.

The first byte of a transmission and the last two bytes of reception are
sent/received using PIO. This is needed for the HW to have access to the
first byte before DMA transmit and to be able to set the STOP condition
for DMA reception.
