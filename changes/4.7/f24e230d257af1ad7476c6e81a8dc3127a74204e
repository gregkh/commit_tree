netfilter: x_tables: don't move to non-existent next rule

Ben Hawkes says:

 In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
 is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
 next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
 counter value at the supplied offset.

Base chains enforce absolute verdict.

User defined chains are supposed to end with an unconditional return,
xtables userspace adds them automatically.

But if such return is missing we will move to non-existent next rule.
