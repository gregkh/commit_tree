arm64: kvm: Move lr save/restore from do_el2_call into EL1

Today the 'hvc' calling KVM or the hyp-stub is expected to preserve all
registers. KVM saves/restores the registers it needs on the EL2 stack using
do_el2_call(). The hyp-stub has no stack, later patches need to be able to
be able to clobber the link register.

Move the link register save/restore to the the call sites.
