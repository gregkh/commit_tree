pps: do not crash when failed to register

With this command sequence:

  modprobe plip
  modprobe pps_parport
  rmmod pps_parport

the partport_pps modules causes this crash:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)
  IP: parport_detach+0x1d/0x60 [pps_parport]
  Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
  ...
  Call Trace:
    parport_unregister_driver+0x65/0xc0 [parport]
    SyS_delete_module+0x187/0x210

The sequence that builds up to this is:

 1) plip is loaded and takes the parport device for exclusive use:

    plip0: Parallel port at 0x378, using IRQ 7.

 2) pps_parport then fails to grab the device:

    pps_parport: parallel port PPS client
    parport0: cannot grant exclusive access for device pps_parport
    pps_parport: couldn't register with parport0

 3) rmmod of pps_parport is then killed because it tries to access
    pardev->name, but pardev (taken from port->cad) is NULL.

So add a check for NULL in the test there too.
