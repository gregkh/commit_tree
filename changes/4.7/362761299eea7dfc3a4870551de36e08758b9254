power_supply: tps65217-charger: Fix NULL deref during property export

This bug leads to:

Driver was trying to use drv_data in property get handler. However drv_data
was not set, so it caused NULL pointer dereference. This patch properly
sets drv_data during probe by power_supply_config parameter, so the
property get handler works as desired.
