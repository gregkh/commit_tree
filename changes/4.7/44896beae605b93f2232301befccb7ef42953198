gpio: pca953x: add PCAL9535 interrupt support for Galileo Gen2

Galileo Gen2 board uses the PCAL9535 as the GPIO expansion,
it is different from PCA9535 and includes interrupt mask/status registers,
The current driver does not support the interrupt registers configuration,
it causes some gpio pins cannot trigger interrupt events,
this patch fix this issue.
