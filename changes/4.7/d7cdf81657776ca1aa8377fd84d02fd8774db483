netfilter: x_tables: get rid of old and inconsistent debugging

The dprintf() and duprintf() functions are enabled at compile time,
these days we have better runtime debugging through pr_debug() and
static keys.

On top of this, this debugging is so old that I don't expect anyone
using this anymore, so let's get rid of this.

IP_NF_ASSERT() is still left in place, although this needs that
NETFILTER_DEBUG is enabled, I think these assertions provide useful
context information when reading the code.

Note that ARP_NF_ASSERT() has been removed as there is no user of
this.

Kill also DEBUG_ALLOW_ALL and a couple of pr_error() and pr_debug()
spots that are inconsistently placed in the code.
