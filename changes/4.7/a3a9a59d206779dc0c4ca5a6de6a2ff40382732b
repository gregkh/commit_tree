x86: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

PGALLOC_GFP uses __GFP_REPEAT but none of the allocation which uses this
flag is for more than order-0.  This means that this flag has never been
actually useful here because it has always been used only for
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
