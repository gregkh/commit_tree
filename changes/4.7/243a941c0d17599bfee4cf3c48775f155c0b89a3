staging: lustre: lnet: add per NI configuration structures

Currently for LNet all hardware configuration is done with
the modprobe configuration file. These settings are applied
to all hardware instances for a node. That makes it impossible
to configure two different pieces of infiniband hardware that
require very different settings to function. Here we
introduce the infrastructre to allow applying per interface
settings.
