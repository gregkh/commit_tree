staging/lustre:llite: remove struct ll_ra_read

Ever since removal of the the unused function ll_ra_read_get(),
the struct ll_ra_read members lrr_reader and lrr_linkage and
the struct ll_readahead_state member ras_read_beads unnecessary
so remove them.
In struct vvp_io replace the struct ll_ra_read cui_bead member with
cui_ra_start and cui_ra_count.
