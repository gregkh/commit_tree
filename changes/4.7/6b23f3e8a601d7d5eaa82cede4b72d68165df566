drm/i915: Replace ILK eDP underrun suppression with something better

The underruns we were seeing when enabling eDP port A on ILK seem to
have been caused by prematurely clearing the LP1+ watermark values when
disabling LP1+ watermarks. Now that the watermarks are handled
properly, we can rip out the underrun suppression around the port A
enable.

We still need to worry about the underruns on FDI when enabling
the eDP PLL. But as Bspec tells us, we can avoid that by a vblank
wait on the pipe driving FDI just prior to enabling the eDP PLL.
