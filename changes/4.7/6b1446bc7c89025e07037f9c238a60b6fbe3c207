[media] v4l: vsp1: video: Fix coding style

Commit 54b5a749b4f3 ("[media] v4l: vsp1: Use media entity enumeration
interface") wasn't aligned with the driver coding style. Fix it by
renaming the rval variable to ret.

Furthermore shorten lines by accessing the media_device instance in a
more straightforward fashion.
