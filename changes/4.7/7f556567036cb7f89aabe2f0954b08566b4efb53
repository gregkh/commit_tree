tmpfs: fix regression hang in fallocate undo

The well-spotted fallocate undo fix is good in most cases, but not when
fallocate failed on the very first page.  index 0 then passes lend -1
to shmem_undo_range(), and that has two bad effects: (a) that it will
undo every fallocation throughout the file, unrestricted by the current
range; but more importantly (b) it can cause the undo to hang, because
lend -1 is treated as truncation, which makes it keep on retrying until
every page has gone, but those already fully instantiated will never go
away.  Big thank you to xfstests generic/269 which demonstrates this.
