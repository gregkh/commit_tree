coresight: etb10: splitting sysFS "status" entry

The sysFS "status" entry conveys a wealth of information about
the status of the HW but goes agains the sysFS rule of one topic
per file.

This patch rectify the situation by adding read-only entries for
each of the field formaly displayed by "status".  The ABI
documentation is kept up to date.
