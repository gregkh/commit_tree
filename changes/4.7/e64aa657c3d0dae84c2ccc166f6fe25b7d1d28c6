target: enhance and export target_alloc_sgl/target_free_sgl

The SRP target driver will need to allocate and chain it's own SGLs soon.
For this export target_alloc_sgl, and add a new argument to it so that it
can allocate an additional chain entry that doesn't point to a page.  Also
export transport_free_sgl after renaming it to target_free_sgl to free
these SGLs again.
