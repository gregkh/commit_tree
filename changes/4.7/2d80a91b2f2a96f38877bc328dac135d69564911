regulator: core: Add debugfs to show constraint flags

There are debugfs entries for voltage and current, but not for
the constraint flags. It's useful for debugging to be able to
see what these flags are so this patch adds a new debugfs file.
We can't use debugfs_create_bool for this because the flags are
bitfields, so as this needs a special read callback they have been
collected into a single file that lists all the flags.
