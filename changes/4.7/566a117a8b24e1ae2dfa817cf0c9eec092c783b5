PKCS#7: Make the signature a pointer rather than embedding it

Point to the public_key_signature struct from the pkcs7_signed_info struct
rather than embedding it.  This makes the code consistent with the X.509
signature handling and makes it possible to have a common cleanup function.

We also save a copy of the digest in the signature without sharing the
memory with the crypto layer metadata.
