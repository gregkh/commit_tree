[media] adv7604: Don't ignore pad number in subdev DV timings pad operations

The dv_timings_cap() and enum_dv_timings() pad operations take a pad
number as an input argument and return the DV timings capabilities and
list of supported DV timings for that pad.

Commit bd3e275f3ec0 ("[media] media: i2c: adv7604: Use v4l2-dv-timings
helpers") broke this as it started ignoring the pad number, always
returning the information associated with the currently selected input.
Fix it.
