ibft: Expose iBFT acpi header via sysfs

Some ethernet adapter vendors are supplying products which support optional
(payed license) features. On some adapters this includes a hardware iscsi
initiator.  The same adapters in a normal (no extra licenses) mode of
operation can be used as a software iscsi initiator.  In addition, software
iscsi boot initiators are becoming a standard part of many vendors uefi
implementations.  This is creating difficulties during early boot/install
determining the proper configuration method for these adapters when they
are used as a boot device.

The attached patch creates sysfs entries to expose information from the
acpi header of the ibft table.  This information allows for a method to
easily determining if an ibft table was created by a ethernet card's
firmware or the system uefi/bios.  In the case of a hardware initiator this
information in combination with the pci vendor and device id can be used
to ascertain any vendor specific behaviors that need to be accommodated.
