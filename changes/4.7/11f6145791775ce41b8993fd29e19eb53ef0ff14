drm/i915/lpt: Avoid early timeout during FDI PHY reset

Since wait_for_atomic doesn't re-check the wait-for condition after
expiry of the timeout it can fail when called from non-atomic context
even if the condition is set correctly before the expiry. Fix this by
using the non-atomic wait_for instead.
