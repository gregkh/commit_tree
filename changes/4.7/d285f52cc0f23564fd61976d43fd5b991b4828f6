batman-adv: Fix integer overflow in batadv_iv_ogm_calc_tq

The undefined behavior sanatizer detected an signed integer overflow in a
setup with near perfect link quality

    UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in net/batman-adv/bat_iv_ogm.c:1246:25
    signed integer overflow:
    8713350 * 255 cannot be represented in type 'int'

The problems happens because the calculation of mixed unsigned and signed
integers resulted in an integer multiplication.

      batadv_ogm_packet::tq (u8 255)
    * tq_own (u8 255)
    * tq_asym_penalty (int 134; max 255)
    * tq_iface_penalty (int 255; max 255)

The tq_iface_penalty, tq_asym_penalty and inv_asym_penalty can just be
changed to unsigned int because they are not expected to become negative.
