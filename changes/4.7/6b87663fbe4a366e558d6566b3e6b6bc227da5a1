net/mlx5e: avoid stack overflow in mlx5e_open_channels

struct mlx5e_channel_param is a large structure that is allocated
on the stack of mlx5e_open_channels, and with a recent change
it has grown beyond the warning size for the maximum stack
that a single function should use:

mellanox/mlx5/core/en_main.c: In function 'mlx5e_open_channels':
mellanox/mlx5/core/en_main.c:1325:1: error: the frame size of 1072 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

The function is already using dynamic allocation and is not in
a fast path, so the easiest workaround is to use another kzalloc
for allocating the channel parameters.
