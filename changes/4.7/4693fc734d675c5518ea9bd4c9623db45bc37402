KEYS: Add placeholder for KDF usage with DH

The values computed during Diffie-Hellman key exchange are often used
in combination with key derivation functions to create cryptographic
keys.  Add a placeholder for a later implementation to configure a
key derivation function that will transform the Diffie-Hellman
result returned by the KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE command.

[This patch was stripped down from a patch produced by Mat Martineau that
 had a bug in the compat code - so for the moment Stephan's patch simply
 requires that the placeholder argument must be NULL]
