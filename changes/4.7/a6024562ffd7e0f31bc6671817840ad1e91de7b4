udp: Add GRO functions to UDP socket

This patch adds GRO functions (gro_receive and gro_complete) to UDP
sockets. udp_gro_receive is changed to perform socket lookup on a
packet. If a socket is found the related GRO functions are called.

This features obsoletes using UDP offload infrastructure for GRO
(udp_offload). This has the advantage of not being limited to provide
offload on a per port basis, GRO is now applied to whatever individual
UDP sockets are bound to.  This also allows the possbility of
"application defined GRO"-- that is we can attach something like
a BPF program to a UDP socket to perfrom GRO on an application
layer protocol.
