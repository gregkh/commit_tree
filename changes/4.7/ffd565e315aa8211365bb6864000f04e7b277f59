irqchip: nps: add 64BIT dependency

The newly added nps irqchip driver causes build warnings on ARM64.

  include/soc/nps/common.h: In function 'nps_host_reg_non_cl':
  include/soc/nps/common.h:148:9: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]

As the driver is only used on ARC, we don't need to see it without
COMPILE_TEST elsewhere, and we can avoid the warnings by only building
on 32-bit architectures even with CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST.
