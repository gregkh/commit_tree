mlxsw: spectrum: Add IEEE 802.1Qbb PFC support

Implement the appropriate DCB ops and allow a user to configure certain
traffic classes as lossless.

The operation configures PFC for both the egress (respecting PFC frames)
and ingress (sending PFC frames) parts of the port.

At egress, when a PFC frame is received for a PFC enabled priority, then
all the priorities mapped to the same TC are stopped.

At ingress, the priority group (PG) buffers to which the enabled PFC
priorities are mapped are configured to be lossless. PFC frames will be
transmitted when the Xoff threshold is crossed.

The user-supplied delay parameter is used to determine the PG's size
according to the following formula:

PG_SIZE = PG_SIZE_LOSSY + delay * CELL_FACTOR + MTU

In the worst case scenario the delay will be made up of packets that
are all of size CELL_SIZE + 1, which means each packet will require
almost twice its true size when buffered in the switch. We therefore
multiply this value by the "cell factor", which is close to 2.

Another MTU is added in case the transmitting host already started
transmitting a maximum length frame when the PFC packet was received.

As with PAUSE enabled ports, when the port's MTU is changed both the
PGs' size and threshold are adjusted accordingly.
