ACPICA: Hardware: Add optimized access bit width support

ACPICA commit c49a751b4dae7baec1790748a2b4b6e8ab599f51

For Access Size = 0, it actually can use user expected access bit width.
This patch implements this.

Besides of the ACPICA upstream commit, this patch also includes a fix fixing
the issue reported by the FreeBSD community.

The old register descriptors are translated in acpi_tb_init_generic_address()
with access_width being filled with 0. This breaks code in
acpi_hw_get_access_bit_width() when the registers are 16-bit IO ports and their
bit_width fields are filled with 16. The rapid fix is meant to make code
written for acpi_hw_get_access_bit_width() regression safer before the issue is
correctly fixed from acpi_tb_init_generic_address(). Reported by
John Baldwin <jhb@freebsd.org>, fixed by Lv Zheng <lv.zheng@intel.com>, tested
