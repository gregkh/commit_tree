ARM: dts: sh73a0: Remove unnecessary clock-output-names properties

* Fixed rate and fixed factor clocks do not require an
  clock-output-names property.
* Since 07705583e920fef6 ("clk: shmobile: div6: Make clock-output-names
  optional") Renesas div6 clocks do not require a clock-output-names
  property.

In the above cases there is only one clock output and its name is taken
from that of the clock node.  Accordingly, remove the unnecessary
clock-output-names properties and as necessary update the node names.

The clock-output-names property is left in place for the zb_clk which is
thus treated as a special case as the MSTP clock driver (clk-mstp.c)
explicitly looks for a clock with node name zb_clk for the r8a73a4 and
sh73a0 SoCs.
