bridge: vlan: learn to count

Add support for per-VLAN Tx/Rx statistics. Every global vlan context gets
allocated a per-cpu stats which is then set in each per-port vlan context
for quick access. The br_allowed_ingress() common function is used to
account for Rx packets and the br_handle_vlan() common function is used
to account for Tx packets. Stats accounting is performed only if the
bridge-wide vlan_stats_enabled option is set either via sysfs or netlink.
A struct hole between vlan_enabled and vlan_proto is used for the new
option so it is in the same cache line. Currently it is binary (on/off)
but it is intentionally restricted to exactly 0 and 1 since other values
will be used in the future for different purposes (e.g. per-port stats).
