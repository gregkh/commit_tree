gso: Do not perform partial GSO if number of partial segments is 1 or less

In the event that the number of partial segments is equal to 1 we don't
really need to perform partial segmentation offload.  As such we should
skip multiplying the MSS and instead just clear the partial_segs value
since it will not provide any gain to advertise the frame as being GSO when
it is a single frame.
