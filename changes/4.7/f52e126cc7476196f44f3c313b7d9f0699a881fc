ARC: unwind: ensure that .debug_frame is generated (vs. .eh_frame)

With recent binutils update to support dwarf CFI pseudo-ops in gas, we
now get .eh_frame vs. .debug_frame. Although the call frame info is
exactly the same in both, the CIE differs, which the current kernel
unwinder can't cope with.

This broke both the kernel unwinder as well as loadable modules (latter
because of a new unhandled relo R_ARC_32_PCREL from .rela.eh_frame in
the module loader)

The ideal solution would be to switch unwinder to .eh_frame.
For now however we can make do by just ensureing .debug_frame is
generated by removing -fasynchronous-unwind-tables

 .eh_frame    generated with -gdwarf-2 -fasynchronous-unwind-tables
 .debug_frame generated with -gdwarf-2

Fixes STAR 9001058196
