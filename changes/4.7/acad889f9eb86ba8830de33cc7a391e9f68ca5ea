drm/i915/bxt: add missing DSI power domain to power well 1

The DSI power domain was missing from BXT power well 1 definitions,
failing to get the power well for DSI transcoders. As pipe A is in the
same power well as DSI transcoders, the problem should only occur with
pipes B and C.

According to Ville, this is basically a nop since pw1 is under dmc
control. But given that we still have this stuff defined here, it's
clearly correct to include DSI here.
