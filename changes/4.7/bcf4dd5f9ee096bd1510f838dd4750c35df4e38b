s390: fix test_fp_ctl inline assembly contraints

The test_fp_ctl function is used to test if a given value is a valid
floating-point control. The inline assembly in test_fp_ctl uses an
incorrect constraint for the 'orig_fpc' variable. If the compiler
chooses the same register for 'fpc' and 'orig_fpc' the test_fp_ctl()
function always returns true. This allows user space to trigger
kernel oopses with invalid floating-point control values on the
signal stack.

This problem has been introduced with git commit 4725c86055f5bbdcdf
"s390: fix save and restore of the floating-point-control register"
