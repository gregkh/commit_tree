xen-netback: correct length checks on hash copy_ops

The length checks on the grant table copy_ops for setting hash key and
hash mapping are checking the local 'len' value which is correct in
the case of the former but not the latter. This was picked up by
static analysis checks.

This patch replaces checks of 'len' with 'copy_op.len' in both cases
to correct the incorrect check, keep the two checks consistent, and to
make it clear what the checks are for.
