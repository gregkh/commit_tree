phy: ti-pipe3: Program the DPLL even if it was already locked

If bootloader has set a wrong DPLL then we must trash those values
and re-program it anyways. This fixes USB3 devices not being enumerated
on beagle-x15 if usb was started in u-boot.

We don't re-program SATA DPLL if it is locked as it was causing
SATA failures if device was hotpluged after boot.
