kernel/padata.c: removed unused code

By accident I stumbled across code that has never been used.  This
driver has EXPORT_SYMBOL functions, and the only user of the code is
pcrypt.c, but this only uses a subset of the exported symbols.

According to 'git log -G', the functions, padata_set_cpumasks,
padata_add_cpu, and padata_remove_cpu have never been used since they
were first introduced.  This patch removes the unused code.

On one 64 bit build, with CRYPTO_PCRYPT built in, the text is more than
4k smaller.

  kbuild_hp> size $KBUILD_OUTPUT/vmlinux
      text    data     bss      dec hex    filename
  10566658 4678360 1122304 16367322 f9beda vmlinux
  10561984 4678360 1122304 16362648 f9ac98 vmlinux

On another config, 32 bit, the saving is about 0.5k bytes.
