HID: usbhid: quirks for Corsair RGB keyboard & mice (K70R, K95RGB, M65RGB, K70RGB, K65RGB)

These devices feature multiple interfaces/endpoints: a legacy BIOS/boot
interface (endpoint 0x81), as well as 2 corsair-specific keyboard interfaces
(endpoint 0x82, 0x83 IN/0x03 OUT) and an RGB LED control interface (endpoint
0x84 IN/0x04 OUT)

Because the extra 3 interfaces are not of subclass USB_INTERFACE_SUBCLASS_BOOT,
HID_QUIRK_NOGET is not automatically set on them and a 10s timeout per-endpoint
(30s per device) occurs initialising reports on boot.  We configure
HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS for these devices.

Additionally the left-side G1-G18 macro keys on the K95RGB generate output on
the un-opened 0x82/0x83 endpoints which causes the keyboard to stop responding
waiting for this event to be collected.  We enable HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL to
prevent this situation from occurring.
