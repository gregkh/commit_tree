bridge: netlink: export per-vlan stats

Add a new LINK_XSTATS_TYPE_BRIDGE attribute and implement the
RTM_GETSTATS callbacks for IFLA_STATS_LINK_XSTATS (fill_linkxstats and
get_linkxstats_size) in order to export the per-vlan stats.
The paddings were added because soon these fields will be needed for
per-port per-vlan stats (or something else if someone beats me to it) so
avoiding at least a few more netlink attributes.
