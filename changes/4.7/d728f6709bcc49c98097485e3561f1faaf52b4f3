MIPS: math-emu: Unify ieee754dp_m{add,sub}f

The code for emulating MIPSr6 madd.d & msub.d instructions has
previously been implemented as 2 different functions, namely
ieee754dp_maddf & ieee754dp_msubf. The difference in behaviour of these
2 instructions is merely the sign of the product, so we can easily share
the code implementing them. Do this for the double precision variant,
removing the original ieee754dp_msubf in favor of reusing the code from
ieee754dp_maddf.
