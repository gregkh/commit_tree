fix a regression in atomic_open()

open("/foo/no_such_file", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT) on should fail with
EACCES when /foo is not writable; failing with ENOENT is obviously
wrong.  That got broken by a braino introduced when moving the
creat_error logics from atomic_open() to lookup_open().  Easy to
fix, fortunately.
