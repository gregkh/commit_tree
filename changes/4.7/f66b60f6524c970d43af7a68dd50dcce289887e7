mac80211: fix parsing of 40Mhz in injected radiotap header

The MCS bandwidth part of the radiotap header is 2 bits wide. The full 2
bit have to compared against IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_MCS_BW_40 and not only if
the first bit is set. Otherwise IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_MCS_BW_40 can be
confused with IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_MCS_BW_20U.
