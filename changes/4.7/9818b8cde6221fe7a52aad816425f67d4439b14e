madvise_free, thp: fix madvise_free_huge_pmd return value after splitting

madvise_free_huge_pmd should return 0 if the fallback PTE operations are
required.  In madvise_free_huge_pmd, if part pages of THP are discarded,
the THP will be split and fallback PTE operations should be used if
splitting succeeds.  But the original code will make fallback PTE
operations skipped, after splitting succeeds.  Fix that via make
madvise_free_huge_pmd return 0 after splitting successfully, so that the
fallback PTE operations will be done.
