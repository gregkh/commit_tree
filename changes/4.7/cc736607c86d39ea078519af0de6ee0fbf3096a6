gpio: ws16c48: Utilize the ISA bus driver

The WinSystems WS16C48 communicates via the ISA bus. As such, it is more
appropriate to use the ISA bus driver over the platform driver to
control the WinSystems WS16C48 GPIO driver.

This patch also adds support for multiple devices via the base and irq
module array parameters. Each element of the base array corresponds to a
discrete device; each element of the irq array corresponds to the
respective device addressed in the respective base array element.
