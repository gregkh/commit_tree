radix-tree: rename indirect_to_ptr() to entry_to_node()

Mirrors the earlier commit introducing node_to_entry().

Also change the type returned to be a struct radix_tree_node pointer.
That lets us simplify a couple of places in the radix tree shrink &
extend paths where we could convert an entry into a pointer, modify the
node, then convert the pointer back into an entry.
