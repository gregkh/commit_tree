arm64: kvm: allows kvm cpu hotplug

The current kvm implementation on arm64 does cpu-specific initialization
at system boot, and has no way to gracefully shutdown a core in terms of
kvm. This prevents kexec from rebooting the system at EL2.

This patch adds a cpu tear-down function and also puts an existing cpu-init
code into a separate function, kvm_arch_hardware_disable() and
kvm_arch_hardware_enable() respectively.
We don't need the arm64 specific cpu hotplug hook any more.

Since this patch modifies common code between arm and arm64, one stub
definition, __cpu_reset_hyp_mode(), is added on arm side to avoid
compilation errors.
