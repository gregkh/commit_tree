ARM: 8552/1: kallsyms: remove special lower address limit for CONFIG_ARM

Now that we no longer emit .stubs symbols into a section VMA loaded
at absolute address 0x1000, we can drop the ARM-specific override that
sets a lower limit based on CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET, below which symbols are
filtered from the kallsyms output.
