powerpc: Initialise pci_io_base as early as possible

Commit d6a9996e84ac ("powerpc/mm: vmalloc abstraction in preparation for
radix") turned kernel memory and IO addresses from #defined constants to
variables initialised at runtime.

On PA6T (pasemi) systems the setup_arch() machine call initialises the
onboard PCI-e root-ports, and uses pci_io_base to do this, which is now
before its value has been set, resulting in a panic early in boot before
console IO is initialised.

Move the pci_io_base initialisation to the same place as vmalloc ranges
are set (hash__early_init_mmu()/radix__early_init_mmu()) - this is the
earliest possible place we can initialise it.
