[media] v4l: vsp1: Consolidate entity ops in a struct vsp1_entity_operations

Entities have two operations, a destroy operation stored directly in
vsp1_entity and a set_memory operation stored in a vsp1_rwpf_operations
structure. Move the two to a more generic vsp1_entity_operations
structure that will serve to implement additional operations.
