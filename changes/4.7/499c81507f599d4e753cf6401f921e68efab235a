arm64/debug: Remove superfluous SMP function call

Since commit 1cf4f629d9d2 ("cpu/hotplug: Move online calls to
hotplugged cpu") it is ensured that callbacks of CPU_ONLINE and
CPU_DOWN_PREPARE are processed on the hotplugged CPU. Due to this SMP
function calls are no longer required.

Replace smp_call_function_single() with a direct call to
clear_os_lock(). The function writes the OSLAR register to clear OS
locking. This does not require to be called with interrupts disabled,
therefore the smp_call_function_single() calling convention is not
preserved.
