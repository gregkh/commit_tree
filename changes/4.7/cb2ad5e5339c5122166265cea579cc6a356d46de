ARC: [axs10x] Specify reserved memory for frame buffer

Allocation of a frame buffer memory in a special memory region
allows bypassing of so-called IO Coherency aperture
which is typically set as a range 0x8z-0xAz.

I.e. all data traffic to PGU bypasses IO Coherency block
and saves its bandwidth for other peripherals.

Even though for AXS101 (which sorts ARC770 CPU) IOC is not
an option for a sake of keeping one DT description for the
base-board (axs10x_mb.dtsi) we're still defining reserved
memory location in the very end of DDR.
