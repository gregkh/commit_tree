coresight: tmc: allocating memory when needed

In it's current form the TMC probe() function allocates
trace buffer memory at boot time, event if coresight isn't
used.  This is highly inefficient since trace buffers can
occupy a lot of memory that could be used otherwised.

This patch allocates trace buffers on the fly, when the
coresight subsystem is solicited.  Allocated buffers are
released when traces are read using the device descriptors
under /dev.
