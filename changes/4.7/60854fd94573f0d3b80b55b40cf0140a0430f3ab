mac80211: mesh: convert path table to rhashtable

In the time since the mesh path table was implemented as an
RCU-traversable, dynamically growing hash table, a generic RCU
hashtable implementation was added to the kernel.

Switch the mesh path table over to rhashtable to remove some code
and also gain some features like automatic shrinking.
