MIPS: Add support for extending builtin cmdline

Allow the builtin command line to be extended by what the bootloader
passes in.  For example, the bootloader can pass specific arguments
depending on the boot mode, and these should override the defaults in
the builtin cmdline.

The default MIPS_CMDLINE_FROM_BOOTLOADER option prepends the
bootloader's cmdline to the builtin cmdline so is not suitable for this
purpose.
