ARM: reintroduce ioremap_cached() for creating cached I/O mappings

The original ARM-only ioremap flavor 'ioremap_cached' has been renamed
to 'ioremap_cache' to align with other architectures, and subsequently
abused in generic code to map things like firmware tables in memory.
For that reason, there is currently an effort underway to deprecate
ioremap_cache, whose semantics are poorly defined, and which is typed
with an __iomem annotation that is inappropriate for mappings of ordinary
memory.

However, original users of ioremap_cached() used it in a context where
the I/O connotation is appropriate, and replacing those instances with
memremap() does not make sense. So let's revive ioremap_cached(), so
that we can change back those original users before we drop ioremap_cache
entirely in favor of memremap.
