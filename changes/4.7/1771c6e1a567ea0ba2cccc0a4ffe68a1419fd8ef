x86/kasan: instrument user memory access API

Exchange between user and kernel memory is coded in assembly language.
Which means that such accesses won't be spotted by KASAN as a compiler
instruments only C code.

Add explicit KASAN checks to user memory access API to ensure that
userspace writes to (or reads from) a valid kernel memory.

Note: Unlike others strncpy_from_user() is written mostly in C and KASAN
sees memory accesses in it.  However, it makes sense to add explicit
check for all @count bytes that *potentially* could be written to the
kernel.
