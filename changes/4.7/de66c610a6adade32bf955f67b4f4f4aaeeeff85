fm10k: prevent null pointer dereference of msix_entries table

According to the C standard dereferencing a variable before it is
checked invokes undefined behavior, and thus compilers are free to
assume the check for NULL isn't necessary. Prevent this by re-ordering
the NULL check of msix_entries in fm10k_free_mbx_irq.
