Input: tsc200x - report proper input_dev name

Passes input_id struct to the common probe function for the tsc200x drivers
instead of just the bustype.

This allows for the use of the product variable to set the input_dev->name
variable according to the type of touchscreen used. Note that when we
introduced support for TSC2004 we started calling everything TSC200X, so
let's keep this quirk.
