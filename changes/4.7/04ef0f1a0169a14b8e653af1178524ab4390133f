IB/mlx4: Fix unaligned access in send_reply_to_slave

The problem is that the function 'send_reply_to_slave' gets the
'req_sa_mad' as a pointer whose address is only aliged to 4 bytes
but is 8 bytes in size.  This can result in unaligned access faults
on certain architectures.

Sowmini Varadhan pointed to this reply from Dave Miller that say
that memcpy should not be used to solve alignment issues:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/21/352

Optimization of memcpy to 'ldx' instruction can only happen if the
compiler knows that the size of the data we are copying is 8 bytes
and it assumes it is aligned to 8 bytes. If the compiler know the
type is not aligned to 8 it must not optimize the 8 byte copy.
Defining the data type as aligned to 4 forces the compiler to treat
all accesses as though they aren't aligned and avoids the 'ldx'
optimization.
