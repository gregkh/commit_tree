brcmfmac: clear eventmask array before using it

When the event_msgs iovar is set an array is used to configure the
enabled events. This arrays needs to nulled before configuring
otherwise unhandled events will be enabled. This solves a problem
where in case of wowl the host got woken by an incorrectly enabled
event.
