ALSA: hda - Fix headphone noise on Dell XPS 13 9360

The headphone has noise when playing sound or switching microphone sources.
It uses the same codec on XPS 13 9350, but with different subsystem ID.
Applying the fixup can solve the issue.
Also, changing the model name to better differentiate models.

v2: Reorder by device ID.
