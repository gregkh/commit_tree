mmc: pxamci: fix potential oops

As reported by Dan in his report in [1], there is a potential NULL
pointer derefence if these conditions are met :
 - there is no platform_data provided, ie. host->pdata = NULL

Fix this by only using the platform data ro_invert when a gpio for
read-only is provided by the platform data.

This doesn't appear yet as every pxa board provides a platform_data, and
calls pxa_set_mci_info() with a non NULL pointer.

The commit fd546ee6a7dc ("mmc: pxamci: fix card detect with slot-gpio
API") from Sep 26, 2015, leads to the following static checker warning:

	drivers/mmc/host/pxamci.c:809 pxamci_probe()
	warn: variable dereferenced before check 'host->pdata' (see line 798)
