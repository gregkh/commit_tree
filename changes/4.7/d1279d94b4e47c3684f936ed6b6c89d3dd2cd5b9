gpio: of: Scan available child node for gpio-hog

Look for child node which are available when iterating for
gpio hog node for request/set GPIO initial configuration
during OF gpio chip registration.

All it really does is make it possible to set
status = "disabled"; in the hog nodes, and then they will
not be applied.
