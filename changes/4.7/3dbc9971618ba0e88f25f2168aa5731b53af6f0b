MIPS: smp-cps: Pull cache init into a function

In preparation for further modifications to mips_cps_core_entry, pull
the L1 cache initialisation out into a separate function. This both
makes the code in mips_cps_core_entry read more clearly, particularly
when modifying it, and shortens it which will become important as code
is added that needs to continue to fit within the reset vector.
