IB/qib, IB/hfi1: Fix up UD loopback use of irq flags

The dual lock patch moved locking around and missed an issue
with handling irq flags when processing UD loopback
packets.  This issue was revealed by smatch.

Fix for both qib and hfi1 to pass the saved flags to the UD request
builder and handle the changes correctly.
