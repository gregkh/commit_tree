pnp: pnpbios: Add explicit X86_32 dependency to PNPBIOS

The PNPBIOS driver requires preprocessor defines (located in
include/asm/segment.h) only declared if the architecture is set to
X86_32. If the architecture is set to X86_64, the PNPBIOS driver will
not build properly. The X86 dependecy for the PNPBIOS configuration
option is changed to an explicit X86_32	dependency in order to prevent
an attempt to build for an unsupported architecture.
