perf core: Add a 'nr' field to perf_event_callchain_context

We will use it to count how many addresses are in the entry->ip[] array,
excluding PERF_CONTEXT_{KERNEL,USER,etc} entries, so that we can really
return the number of entries specified by the user via the relevant
sysctl, kernel.perf_event_max_contexts, or via the per event
perf_event_attr.sample_max_stack knob.

This way we keep the perf_sample->ip_callchain->nr meaning, that is the
number of entries, be it real addresses or PERF_CONTEXT_ entries, while
honouring the max_stack knobs, i.e. the end result will be max_stack
entries if we have at least that many entries in a given stack trace.
