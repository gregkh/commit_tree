platform/chrome: cros_ec_dev - double fetch bug in ioctl

We verify "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" but we need to make sure
that those values have not changed between the two copy_from_user()
calls.  Otherwise it could lead to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value.
We should use the new smaller value so we don't copy too much data to
the user.
