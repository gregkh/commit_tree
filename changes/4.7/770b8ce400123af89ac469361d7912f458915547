bcache: bch_allocator_thread() is not freezable

bch_allocator_thread() is calling try_to_freeze(), but that's just an
expensive no-op given the fact that the thread is not marked freezable.

Bucket allocator has to be up and running to the very last stages of the
suspend, as the bcache I/O that's in flight (think of writing an
hibernation image to a swap device served by bcache).
