ARC: [plat-eznps] Use dedicated cpu_relax()

Since the CTOP is SMT hardware multi-threaded, we need to hint
the HW that now will be a very good time to do a hardware
thread context switching. This is done by issuing the schd.rw
instruction (binary coded here so as to not require specific
revision of GCC to build the kernel).
sched.rw means that Thread becomes eligible for execution by
the threads scheduler after all pending read/write
transactions were completed.

Implementing cpu_relax_lowlatency() with barrier()
Since with current semantics of cpu_relax() it may take a
while till yielded CPU will get back.
