scripts/gdb: provide linux constants

Some macro's and defines are needed when parsing memory, and without
compiling the kernel as -g3 they are not available in the debug-symbols.

We use the pre-processor here to extract constants to a dedicated module
for the linux debugger extensions

Top level Kbuild is used to call in and generate the constants file,
while maintaining dependencies on autogenerated files in
include/generated
