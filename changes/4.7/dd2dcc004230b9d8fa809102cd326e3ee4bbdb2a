of: mtd: prepare helper reading NAND ECC algo from DT

NAND subsystem is being slightly reworked to store ECC details in
separated fields. In future we'll want to add support for more DT
properties as specifying every possible setup with a single
"nand-ecc-mode" is a pretty bad idea.
To allow this let's add a helper that will support something like
"nand-ecc-algo" in future. Right now we use it for keeping backward
compatibility.
