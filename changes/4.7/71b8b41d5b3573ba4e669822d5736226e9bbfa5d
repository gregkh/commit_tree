drm/i915: Move DPINVGTT setup to vlv_display_irq_reset()

DPINVGTT lives inside the disp2d power well so we can't frob it unless
we know the power well is active. Let's this stuff into
vlv_display_irq_reset() which is only called at the right times so that
we don't get unclaimed register access errors.
