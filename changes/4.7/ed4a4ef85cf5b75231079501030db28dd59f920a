powerpc/perf: Add support for sampling interrupt register state

The perf infrastructure uses a bit mask to find out valid registers to
display. Define a register mask for supported registers defined in
uapi/asm/perf_regs.h. The bit positions also correspond to register IDs
which is used by perf infrastructure to fetch the register values.
CONFIG_HAVE_PERF_REGS enables sampling of the interrupted machine state.
