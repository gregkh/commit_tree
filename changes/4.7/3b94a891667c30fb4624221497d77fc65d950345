perf/x86/intel/uncore: Remove SBOX support for Broadwell server

There was a report that on certain Broadwell-EP systems writing any bit of
the SBOX PMU initialization MSR would #GP at boot. This did not happen
on all systems. My test systems booted fine.

Considering both DE and EP may have such issues, this patch removes SBOX
support for all Broadwell platforms for now.
