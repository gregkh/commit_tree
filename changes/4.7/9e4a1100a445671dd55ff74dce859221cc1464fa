crypto: s5p-sss - Handle unaligned buffers

During crypto selftests on Odroid XU3 (Exynos5422) some of the
algorithms failed because of passing AES-block unaligned source and
destination buffers:

alg: skcipher: encryption failed on chunk test 1 for ecb-aes-s5p: ret=22

Handle such case by copying the buffers to a new aligned and contiguous
space.
