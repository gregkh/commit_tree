libceph: redo callbacks and factor out MOSDOpReply decoding

If you specify ACK | ONDISK and set ->r_unsafe_callback, both
->r_callback and ->r_unsafe_callback(true) are called on ack.  This is
very confusing.  Redo this so that only one of them is called:

    ->r_unsafe_callback(true), on ack
    ->r_unsafe_callback(false), on commit

or

    ->r_callback, on ack|commit

Decode everything in decode_MOSDOpReply() to reduce clutter.
