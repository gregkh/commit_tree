IB/IPoIB: Don't update neigh validity for unresolved entries

ipoib_neigh_get unconditionally updates the "alive" variable member on
any packet send.  This prevents the neighbor garbage collection from
cleaning out a dead neighbor entry if we are still queueing packets
for it.  If the queue for this neighbor is full, then don't update the
alive timestamp.  That way the neighbor can time out even if packets
are still being queued as long as none of them are being sent.
