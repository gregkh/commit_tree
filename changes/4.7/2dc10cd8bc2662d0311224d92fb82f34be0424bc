drm/i915: Fix use after free when printing load failure

Commit d15d7538c6d2 ("drm/i915: Tune down init error message due
to failure injection") added i915_load_error message to failure
path on device initialization. The message is printed
after the device is freed. And as the message printing helper
uses the device structure, this leads to use after free.
