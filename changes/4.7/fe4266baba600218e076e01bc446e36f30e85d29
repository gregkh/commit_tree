ARM: dts: imx6sx: Add 198MHz operating point

198MHz is a valid operating point for mx6sx.

Add entries for VDD_ARM_CAP and VDD_SOC_CAP voltages for 198MHz according
to the imx6sx datahseet:

(a 25mV offset is added to the minimum allowed values for safety).

These values also match the ones from the NXP kernel.
