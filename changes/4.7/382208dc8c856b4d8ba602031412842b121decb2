MIPS: dump_tlb: Preserve and dump GuestID

The GuestID for root TLB operations (GuestCtl1.RID) is modified by TLB
reads, so needs preserving by dump_tlb() like the ASID field of EntryHi.

Also dump the GuestID of each entry if it exists alongside the ASID, as
it forms an important part of the TLB entry when VZ guests are used.
