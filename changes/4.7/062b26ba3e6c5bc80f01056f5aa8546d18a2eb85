powerpc/pci: Cleanup on struct pci_controller_ops

Each PHB has one instance of "struct pci_controller_ops" that includes
various callbacks called by PCI subsystem. In the definition of this
struct, some callbacks have explicit names for its arguments, but the
left don't have.

This adds all explicit names of the arguments to the callbacks in
"struct pci_controller_ops" so that the code looks consistent. Also,
argument name @dev is replaced by @pdev as the later one is the
preferred name for PCI device.
