ASoC: wm8962: Adjust clk definitions so that simple card can work

When trying to use simple card with wm8962 the following probe
error happens:

wm8962 0-001a: simple-card: set_sysclk error
asoc-simple-card sound: ASoC: failed to init 202c000.ssi-wm8962: -22
asoc-simple-card sound: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -22
asoc-simple-card: probe of sound failed with error -22

In simple-card.c the snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk() function is called with
clk_id as 0, which is an invalid clock for wm8962.

Adjust the clocks source definitions in wm8962.h so that the
simple card driver can work successfully.
