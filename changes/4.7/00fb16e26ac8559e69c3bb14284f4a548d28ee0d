locking/rwsem, x86: Add frame annotation for call_rwsem_down_write_failed_killable()

3387a535ce62 ("x86/asm: Create stack frames in rwsem functions") has
added FRAME_{BEGIN,END} annotations to rwsem asm stubs. The patch
which has added call_rwsem_down_write_failed_killable() was based on an
older tree so it didn't know about annotations. Let's add them.

This addresses the following objtool warning:

  arch/x86/lib/rwsem.o: warning: objtool: call_rwsem_down_write_failed_killable()+0xe: call without frame pointer save/setup
