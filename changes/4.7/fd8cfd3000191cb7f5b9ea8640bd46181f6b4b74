arch: fix has_transparent_hugepage()

I've just discovered that the useful-sounding has_transparent_hugepage()
is actually an architecture-dependent minefield: on some arches it only
builds if CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y, on others it's also there when
not, but on some of those (arm and arm64) it then gives the wrong
answer; and on mips alone it's marked __init, which would crash if
called later (but so far it has not been called later).

Straighten this out: make it available to all configs, with a sensible
default in asm-generic/pgtable.h, removing its definitions from those
arches (arc, arm, arm64, sparc, tile) which are served by the default,
adding #define has_transparent_hugepage has_transparent_hugepage to
those (mips, powerpc, s390, x86) which need to override the default at
runtime, and removing the __init from mips (but maybe that kind of code
should be avoided after init: set a static variable the first time it's
called).
