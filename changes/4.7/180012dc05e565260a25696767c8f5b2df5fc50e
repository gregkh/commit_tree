nfp: remove buggy RX buffer length validation

Meaning of data_len and meta_len RX WB descriptor fields is
slightly confusing.  Add a comment with a diagram clarifying
the layout.  Also remove the buffer length validation:
(a) it's imprecise for static rx-offsets; (b) if firmware
is buggy enough to DMA past the end of the buffer
WARN_ON_ONCE() doesn't seem like a strong enough response.
skb_put() will do the checking for us anyway.
