reset: Add support for shared reset controls

In some SoCs some hw-blocks share a reset control. Add support for this
setup by adding new:

reset_control_get_shared()
devm_reset_control_get_shared()
devm_reset_control_get_shared_by_index()

methods to get a reset_control. Note that this patch omits adding of_
variants, if these are needed later they can be easily added.

This patch also changes the behavior of the existing exclusive
reset_control_get() variants, if these are now called more then once
for the same reset_control they will return -EBUSY. To catch existing
drivers triggering this error (there should not be any) a WARN_ON(1)
is added in this path.

When a reset_control is shared, the behavior of reset_control_assert /
deassert is changed, for shared reset_controls these will work like the
clock-enable/disable and regulator-on/off functions. They will keep a
deassert_count, and only (re-)assert the reset after reset_control_assert
has been called as many times as reset_control_deassert was called.

Calling reset_control_assert without first calling reset_control_deassert
is not allowed on a shared reset control. Calling reset_control_reset is
also not allowed on a shared reset control.
