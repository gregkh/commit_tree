fs: kernfs: Replace CURRENT_TIME by current_fs_time()

This is in preparation for the series that transitions
filesystem timestamps to use 64 bit time and hence make
them y2038 safe.

CURRENT_TIME macro will be deleted before merging the
aforementioned series.

Use current_fs_time() instead of CURRENT_TIME for inode
timestamps.

struct kernfs_node is associated with a sysfs file/ directory.
Truncate the values to appropriate time granularity when
writing to inode timestamps of the files.

ktime_get_real_ts() is used to obtain times for
struct kernfs_iattrs. Since these times are later assigned to
inode times using timespec_truncate() for all filesystem based
operations, we can save the supers list traversal time here by
using ktime_get_real_ts() directly.
