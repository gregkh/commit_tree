netfilter: x_tables: check standard target size too

We have targets and standard targets -- the latter carries a verdict.

The ip/ip6tables validation functions will access t->verdict for the
standard targets to fetch the jump offset or verdict for chainloop
detection, but this happens before the targets get checked/validated.

Thus we also need to check for verdict presence here, else t->verdict
can point right after a blob.

Spotted with UBSAN while testing malformed blobs.
