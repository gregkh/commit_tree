arm64: kernel: Rework finisher callback out of __cpu_suspend_enter()

Hibernate could make use of the cpu_suspend() code to save/restore cpu
state, however it needs to be able to return '0' from the 'finisher'.

Rework cpu_suspend() so that the finisher is called from C code,
independently from the save/restore of cpu state. Space to save the context
in is allocated in the caller's stack frame, and passed into
__cpu_suspend_enter().

Hibernate's use of this API will look like a copy of the cpu_suspend()
function.
