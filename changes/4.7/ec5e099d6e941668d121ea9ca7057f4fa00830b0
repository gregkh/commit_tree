perf: optimize perf_fetch_caller_regs

avoid memset in perf_fetch_caller_regs, since it's the critical path of all tracepoints.
It's called from perf_sw_event_sched, perf_event_task_sched_in and all of perf_trace_##call
with this_cpu_ptr(&__perf_regs[..]) which are zero initialized by perpcu init logic and
subsequent call to perf_arch_fetch_caller_regs initializes the same fields on all archs,
so we can safely drop memset from all of the above cases and move it into
perf_ftrace_function_call that calls it with stack allocated pt_regs.
