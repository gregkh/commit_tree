power/max8925: freeing wrong variable

We were freeing "info->battery" instead of "info->usb", which leads to
an OOps and a resource leak.

The labels were wonky, "out_battery" did release the battery but out_usb
did not release usb.  I was introducing a call to free usb so it sort
conflicted with existing misleading name.  I renamed them.
