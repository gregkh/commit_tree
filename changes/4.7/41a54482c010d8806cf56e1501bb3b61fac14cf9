KVM: arm/arm64: Move timer IRQ map to latest possible time

We are about to modify the VGIC to allocate all data structures
dynamically and store mapped IRQ information on a per-IRQ struct, which
is indeed allocated dynamically at init time.

Therefore, we cannot record the mapped IRQ info from the timer at timer
reset time like it's done now, because VCPU reset happens before timer
init.

A possible later time to do this is on the first run of a per VCPU, it
just requires us to move the enable state to be a per-VCPU state and do
the lookup of the physical IRQ number when we are about to run the VCPU.
