io-64-nonatomic: Add relaxed accessor variants

Whilst commit 9439eb3ab9d1 ("asm-generic: io: implement relaxed
accessor macros as conditional wrappers") makes the *_relaxed forms of
I/O accessors universally available to drivers, in cases where writeq()
is implemented via the io-64-nonatomic helpers, writeq_relaxed() will
end up falling back to writel() regardless of whether writel_relaxed()
is available (identically for s/write/read/).

Add corresponding relaxed forms of the nonatomic helpers to delegate
to the equivalent 32-bit accessors as appropriate. We also need to fix
io.h to avoid defining default relaxed variants if the basic accessors
themselves don't exist.
