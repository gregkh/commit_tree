ocfs2: o2hb: don't negotiate if last hb fail

Sometimes io error is returned when storage is down for a while.  Like
for iscsi device, stroage is made offline when session timeout, and this
will make all io return -EIO.  For this case, nodes shouldn't do
negotiate timeout but should fence self.  So let nodes fence self when
o2hb_do_disk_heartbeat return an error, this is the same behavior with
o2hb without negotiate timer.
