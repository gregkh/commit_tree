drm/i915: Use GPLL ref clock to calculate GPU freqs on VLV/CHV

Extract the GPLL reference frequency from CCK and use it in the
GPU freq<->opcode conversions on VLV/CHV. This eliminates all the
assumptions we have about which divider is used for which czclk
frequency.

Note that unlike most clocks from CCK, the GPLL ref clock is a divided
down version of the CZ clock rather than the HPLL clock. CZ clock itself
is a divided down version of the HPLL clock though, so in effect it just
gets divided down twice.

While at it, throw in a few comments explaining the remaining constants
for anyone who later wants to compare this to the spreadsheets.
