xen-netback: add control protocol implementation

My recent patch to include/xen/interface/io/netif.h defines a new shared
ring (in addition to the rx and tx rings) for passing control messages
from a VM frontend driver to a backend driver.

A previous patch added the necessary boilerplate for mapping the control
ring from the frontend, should it be created. This patch adds
implementations for each of the defined protocol messages.
