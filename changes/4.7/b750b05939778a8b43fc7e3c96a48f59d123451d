staging: unisys: visorbus: remove unused sysfs attribute devmajorminor/*

The sysfs attribute directory at:

    /sys/bus/visorbus/devices/vbus<x>:dev<y>/devmajorminor/*

or

    /sys/devices/visorbus<x>/vbus<x>:dev<y>/devmajorminor/*

previously provided a location where a visorbus function driver could
publish information (for usermode use) about possibly-multiple major and
minor device numbers for character devices created for a each visorbus
device, using visorbus_registerdevnode().  This functionality is not
currently used, so it has been removed by this cset.
