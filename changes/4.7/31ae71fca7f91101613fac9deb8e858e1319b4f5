drm/i915: Nuke fbc members from intel_crtc->atomic, v4.

Whenever there's an update to the primary plane,
fbc_pre_update and fbc_post_update are called. Kill off
intel_crtc->atomic.update_fbc and now that intel_crtc->atomic
is empty, kill it off too.

Changes since v1:
- Add a intel_fbc_supports_rotation helper.
Changes since v2:
- Remove intel_fbc_supports_rotation_helper.
- Remove unrelated changes.
Changes since v3:
- Rebase
