sparc32: drop hardcoding trap_level in kgdb_trap

Fix this so we pass the trap_level from the actual trap
code like we do in sparc64.
Add use on ENTRY(), ENDPROC() in the assembler function too.

This fixes a bug where the hardcoded value for trap_level
was the sparc64 value.

As the generic code does not use the trap_level argument
(for sparc32) - this patch does not have any functional impact.
