pnfs: keep track of the return sequence number in pnfs_layout_hdr

When we want to selectively do a LAYOUTRETURN, we need to specify a
stateid that represents most recent layout acquisition that is to be
returned.

When we mark a layout stateid to be returned, we update the return
sequence number in the layout header with that value, if it's newer
than the existing one. Then, when we go to do a LAYOUTRETURN on
layout header put, we overwrite the seqid in the stateid with the
saved one, and then zero it out.
