block: make bio_inc_remaining() interface accessible again

Commit 326e1dbb57 ("block: remove management of bi_remaining when
restoring original bi_end_io") made bio_inc_remaining() private to bio.c
because the only use-case that made sense was confined to the
bio_chain() interface.

Since that time DM thinp went on to use bio_chain() in its relatively
complex implementation of async discard support.  That implementation,
even when converted over to use the new async __blkdev_issue_discard()
interface, depends on deferred completion of the original discard bio --
which is most appropriately implemented using bio_inc_remaining().

DM thinp foolishly duplicated bio_inc_remaining(), local to dm-thin.c as
__bio_inc_remaining(), so re-exporting bio_inc_remaining() allows us to
put an end to that foolishness.

All said, bio_inc_remaining() should really only be used in conjunction
with bio_chain().  It isn't intended for generic bio reference counting.
