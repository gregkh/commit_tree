i2c: mv64xxx: remove CONFIG_HAVE_CLK conditionals

When clock support was added to the i2c-mv64xxx, not all clk functions
had stubs when for !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK configurations. However, nowadays,
both "struct clk" and all the clock framework functions have stubs
when CONFIG_HAVE_CLK is not enabled, so it no longer makes sense to
carry such compile-time conditionals in the driver.

This commit was compile tested on both ARM64 (which has both
CONFIG_OF=y and CONFIG_HAVE_CLK=y) and PowerPC c2k_defconfig (which
has CONFIG_OF=y, CONFIG_HAVE_CLK disabled, and the i2c-mv64xxx driver
enabled).

The only non-trivial change is in the mv64xxx_of_config() function,
which was returning -ENODEV unconditionally if CONFIG_HAVE_CLK was
disabled. Simply removing this condition works fine because the first
test done by the function is to verify if drv_data->clk points to a
valid clock, and if it doesn't, we return -ENODEV. When
CONFIG_HAVE_CLK is disabled, devm_clk_get() unconditionally returns
NULL, so mv64xxx_of_config() will return -ENODEV when no clock is
provided, which is the intended behavior.
