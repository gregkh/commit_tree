s390/sclp: event type macro cleanup

Sort the sclp event type defines and use a macro to create the
corresponding event type masks. In addition to that one unused
type/mask pair is removed and another previously unused define
is used now (it was probably unused/unknown because it didn't
follow the EVTYP_X EVTYP_X_MASK convention).
