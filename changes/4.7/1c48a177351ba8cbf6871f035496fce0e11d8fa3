MIPS: Add missing VZ accessor microMIPS encodings

Toolchains may be used which support microMIPS but not VZ instructions
(i.e. binutis 2.22 & 2.23), so extend the explicitly encoded versions of
the guest COP0 register & guest TLB access macros to support microMIPS
encodings too, using the new macros.

This prevents non-microMIPS instructions being executed in microMIPS
mode during CPU probe on cores supporting VZ (e.g. M5150), which cause
reserved instruction exceptions early during boot.
