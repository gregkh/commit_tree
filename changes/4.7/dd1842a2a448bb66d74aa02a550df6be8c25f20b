powerpc/mm: Make page table size a variable

Radix and hash MMU models support different page table sizes. Make
the #defines a variable so that existing code can work with variable
sizes.

Slice related code is only used by hash, so use hash constants there. We
will replicate some of the boundary conditions with resepct to TASK_SIZE
using radix values too. Right now we do boundary condition check using
hash constants.

Swapper pgdir size is initialized in asm code. We select the max pgd
size to keep it simple. For now we select hash pgdir. When adding radix
we will switch that to radix pgdir which is 64K.

BUILD_BUG_ON check which is removed is already done in hugepage_init()
using MAYBE_BUILD_BUG_ON().
