powerpc/mm: pte_frag abstraction

In this patch we make the number of pte fragments per level 4 page table
page a variable. Radix level 4 table size is 256 bytes and hence we can
have 256 fragments per level 4 page. We don't update the fragment count
in this patch. We need to do performance measurements to find the right
value for fragment count.
