nfp: convert .ndo_change_mtu() to prepare/commit paradigm

When changing MTU on running device first allocate new rings
and buffers and once it succeeds proceed with changing MTU.

Allocation of new rings is not really necessary for this
operation - it's done to keep the code simple and because
size of the extra ring memory is quite small compared to
the size of buffers.

Operation can still fail midway through if FW communication
times out.  In that case we retry with old MTU (rings).
