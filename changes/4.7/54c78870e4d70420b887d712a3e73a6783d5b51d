ARM: dts: Add non-removable to hsmmc on hp-t410

This will clean-up warnings at boot, since either that or cd-gpio{,s} are
mandated by the dts specification

 of_get_named_gpiod_flags: can't parse 'cd-gpios' property of node '/ocp/mmc@47810000[0]'
 of_get_named_gpiod_flags: can't parse 'cd-gpio' property of node '/ocp/mmc@47810000[0]'

v2: use the generic non-removable instead of ti,non-removable
