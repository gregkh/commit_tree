arm64: Change cpu_resume() to enable mmu early then access sleep_sp by va

By enabling the MMU early in cpu_resume(), the sleep_save_sp and stack can
be accessed by VA, which avoids the need to convert-addresses and clean to
PoC on the suspend path.

MMU setup is shared with the boot path, meaning the swapper_pg_dir is
restored directly: ttbr1_el1 is no longer saved/restored.

struct sleep_save_sp is removed, replacing it with a single array of
pointers.

cpu_do_{suspend,resume} could be further reduced to not restore: cpacr_el1,
mdscr_el1, tcr_el1, vbar_el1 and sctlr_el1, all of which are set by
__cpu_setup(). However these values all contain res0 bits that may be used
to enable future features.
