gpio: sta2x11: make explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/gpio/Kconfig:config GPIO_STA2X11
drivers/gpio/Kconfig:   bool "STA2x11/ConneXt GPIO support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity, so that when reading
the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
