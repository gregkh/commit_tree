mm, migrate: increment fail count on ENOMEM

If page migration fails due to -ENOMEM, nr_failed should still be
incremented for proper statistics.

This was encountered recently when all page migration vmstats showed 0,
and inferred that migrate_pages() was never called, although in reality
the first page migration failed because compaction_alloc() failed to
find a migration target.

This patch increments nr_failed so the vmstat is properly accounted on
ENOMEM.
