init/Kconfig: keep Expert users menu together

The "expert" menu was broken (split) such that all entries in it after
KALLSYMS were displayed in the "General setup" area instead of in the
"Expert users" area.  Fix this by adding one kconfig dependency.

Yes, the Expert users menu is fragile.  Problems like this have happened
several times in the past.  I will attempt to isolate the Expert users
menu if there is interest in that.
