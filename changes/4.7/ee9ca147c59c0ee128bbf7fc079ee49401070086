ath10k: Fix survey reporting with QCA4019

In QCA4019, cycle counter wraparound in same fashion
as QCA988X. When the cycle counter wraparound it
resets to 0x7fffffff. Set has_shifted_cc_wraparound to
true for QCA4019 to enable the code path to handle cycle
counter wraparound for consistent survey report.
