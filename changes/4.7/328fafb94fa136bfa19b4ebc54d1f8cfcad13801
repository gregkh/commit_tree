usb: hcd: do not call whc_clean_up on wch_init call failure

whc_init already calls whc_clean_up if an error occurs during
the initialization, so calling it again if whc_init fails at
the end of wch_probe will cause double free errors.  Fix this
by bailing out on an whc_init failure to a new label that avoids
doing the duplicated whc_clean_up.
