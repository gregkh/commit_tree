net: marvell: Add separate config ANEG function for Marvell 88E1111

Marvell 88E1111 currently uses the generic marvell config ANEG function.
This function has a sequence accessing Page 5 and Register 31,
both of which are not defined or reserved for this PHY.
Hence this patch adds a new config ANEG function for Marvell 88E1111
without these erroneous accesses.
