lightnvm: move block fold outside of get_bb_tbl()

The get block table command returns a list of blocks and planes
with their associated state. Users, such as gennvm and sysblk,
manages all planes as a single virtual block.

It was therefore  natural to fold the bad block list before it is
returned. However, to allow users, which manages on a per-plane
block level, to also use the interface, the get_bb_tbl interface is
changed to not fold by default and instead let the caller fold if
necessary.
