md: md.c: fix oops in mddev_suspend for raid0

Introduced by upstream commit 70d9798b95562abac005d4ba71d28820f9a201eb

The raid0 personality does not create mddev->thread as oposed to
other personalities leading to its unconditional access in
mddev_suspend() causing an oops.

Patch checks for mddev->thread in order to keep the
intention of aforementioned commit.
