qed: Protect the doorbell BAR with the write barriers.

SPQ doorbell is currently protected with the compilation barrier. Under the
stress scenarios, we may get into a state where (due to the weak ordering)
several ramrod doorbells were written to the BAR with an out-of-order
producer values. Need to change the barrier type to a write barrier to make
sure that the write buffer is flushed after each doorbell.
