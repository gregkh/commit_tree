KVM: x86: make hwapic_isr_update and hwapic_irr_update look the same

Neither APICv nor AVIC actually need the first argument of
hwapic_isr_update, but the vCPU makes more sense than passing the
pointer to the whole virtual machine!  In fact in the APICv case it's
just happening that the vCPU is used implicitly, through the loaded VMCS.

The second argument instead is named differently, make it consistent.
