gpio: sodaville: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/gpio/Kconfig:config GPIO_SODAVILLE
drivers/gpio/Kconfig:   bool "Intel Sodaville GPIO support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_pci_driver() uses the same init level as the
builtin_pci_driver() does, there is no init ordering change
caused by this commit.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
