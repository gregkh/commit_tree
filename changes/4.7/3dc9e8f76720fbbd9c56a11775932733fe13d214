Btrfs: unpin log if rename operation fails

If rename operations fail at some point after we pinned the log, we end
up aborting the current transaction but never unpin the log, which leaves
concurrent tasks that are trying to sync the log (as part of an fsync
request from user space) blocked forever and preventing the filesystem
from being unmountable.

Fix this by safely unpinning the log.
