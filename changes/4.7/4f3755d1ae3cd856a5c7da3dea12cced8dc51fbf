radix tree test suite: start adding multiorder tests

Test suite infrastructure for working with multiorder entries.

The test itself is pretty basic: Add an entry, check that all expected
indices return that entry and that indices around that entry don't
return an entry.  Then delete the entry and check no index returns that
entry.  Tests a few edge conditions including the multiorder entry at
index 0 and at a higher index.  Also tests deleting through an alias as
well as through the canonical index.
