ila: Add struct definitions and helpers

Add structures for identifiers, locators, and an ila address which
is composed of a locator and identifier and in6_addr can be cast to
it. This includes a three bit type field and enums for the types defined
in ILA I-D.

In ILA lwt don't allow user to set a translation for a non-ILA
address (type of identifier is zero meaning it is an IID). This also
requires that the destination prefix is at least 65 bytes (64
bit locator and first byte of identifier).
