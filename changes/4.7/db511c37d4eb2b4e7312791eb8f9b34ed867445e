qed: Fix returning unlimited SPQ entries

Driver has 2 sets of entries for handling ramrod configurations
toward firmware - a regular pre-allocated set of entires and a
possible 'unlimited' list of additional pending entries.

In most scenarios the 'unlimited' list would not be used, but
when it does the handling of the ramrod completion doesn't
properly handle the release of the entry.
