i2c: octeon: Remove zero-length message support

Zero-length message support (SMBUS QUICK or i2c) never worked with
the Octeon hardware. Disable SMBUS QUICK support and bail out in
case of a zero-length i2c request.

After this change 'i2c-detect -q' will return an error on Octeon but
the previously reported results were wrong anyway.
