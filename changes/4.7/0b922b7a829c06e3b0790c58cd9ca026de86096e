net: original ingress device index in PKTINFO

Applications such as OSPF and BFD need the original ingress device not
the VRF device; the latter can be derived from the former. To that end
add the skb_iif to inet_skb_parm and set it in ipv4 code after clearing
the skb control buffer similar to IPv6. From there the pktinfo can just
pull it from cb with the PKTINFO_SKB_CB cast.

The previous patch moving the skb->dev change to L3 means nothing else
is needed for IPv6; it just works.
