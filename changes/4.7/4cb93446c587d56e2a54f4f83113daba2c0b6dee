perf tools: Set the maximum allowed stack from /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack

There is an upper limit to what tooling considers a valid callchain,
and it was tied to the hardcoded value in the kernel,
PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH (127), now that this can be tuned via a sysctl,
make it read it and use that as the upper limit, falling back to
PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH for kernels where this sysctl isn't present.
