qed: IOV l2 functionality

This adds sufficient changes to allow VFs l2-configuration flows to work.

While the fastpath of the VF and the PF are meant to be exactly the same,
the configuration of the VF is done by the PF.
This diverges all VF-related configuration flows that originate from a VF,
making them pass through the VF->PF channel and adding sufficient logic
on the PF side to support them.
