xfs: rename variables in xfs_iflush_cluster for clarity

The cluster inode variable uses unconventional naming - iq - which
makes it hard to distinguish it between the inode passed into the
function - ip - and that is a vector for mistakes to be made.
Rename all the cluster inode variables to use a more conventional
prefixes to reduce potential future confusion (cilist, cilist_size,
cip).
