Btrfs: self-tests: Execute page straddling test only when nodesize < PAGE_SIZE

On ppc64, PAGE_SIZE is 64k which is same as BTRFS_MAX_METADATA_BLOCKSIZE.
In such a scenario, we will never be able to have an extent buffer
containing more than one page. Hence in such cases this commit does not
execute the page straddling tests.
