IB/hfi1: Move driver out of staging

The TODO list for the hfi1 driver was completed during 4.6. In addition
other objections raised (which are far beyond what was in the TODO list)
have been addressed as well. It is now time to remove the driver from
staging and into the drivers/infiniband sub-tree.
