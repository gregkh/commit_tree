ALSA: hda - Update chmap tlv to report sink's capability

The existing TLV callback implementation copies all of the
cea_channel_speaker_allocation map table to the TLV container
irrespective of what is reported by sink. This is of little use
to the userspace application.

With this patch, it parses the spk_alloc block as queried from
the ELD, and copies only the corresponding mapping channel
allocation entries from the cea channel speaker allocation table.
Thus the user can parse the TLV container to identify sink's
capability and set the channel map accordingly.

It shouldn't impact the behavior in AMD chipset, as this makes
use of already parsed spk alloc block to calculate the channel
map.
