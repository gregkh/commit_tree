radix tree test suite: allow testing other fan-out values

The defines in regression2.c are already in radix-tree.h and duplicating
them in the test case makes experimenting with other values for the
fan-out harder than necessary.  Allow the user of the radix tree to
decide what the fan-out should be rather than fixing it to 8 for
non-kernel uses.
