tcp: do not block bh during prequeue processing

AFAIK, nothing in current TCP stack absolutely wants BH
being disabled once socket is owned by a thread running in
process context.

As mentioned in my prior patch ("tcp: give prequeue mode some care"),
processing a batch of packets might take time, better not block BH
at all.
