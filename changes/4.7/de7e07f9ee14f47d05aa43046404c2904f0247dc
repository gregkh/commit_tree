tipc: ensure that first packets on link are sent in order

In some link establishment scenarios we see that packet #2 may be sent
out before packet #1, forcing the receiver to demand retransmission of
the missing packet. This is harmless, but may cause confusion among
people tracing the packet flow.

Since this is extremely easy to fix, we do so by adding en extra send
call to the bearer immediately after the link has come up.
