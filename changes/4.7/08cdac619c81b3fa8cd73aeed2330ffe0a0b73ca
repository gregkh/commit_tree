arm64: relocatable: deal with physically misaligned kernel images

When booting a relocatable kernel image, there is no practical reason
to refuse an image whose load address is not exactly TEXT_OFFSET bytes
above a 2 MB aligned base address, as long as the physical and virtual
misalignment with respect to the swapper block size are equal, and are
both aligned to THREAD_SIZE.

Since the virtual misalignment is under our control when we first enter
the kernel proper, we can simply choose its value to be equal to the
physical misalignment.

So treat the misalignment of the physical load address as the initial
KASLR offset, and fix up the remaining code to deal with that.
