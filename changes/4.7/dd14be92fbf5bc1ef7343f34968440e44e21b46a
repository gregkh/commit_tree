xen: use same main loop for counting and remapping pages

Instead of having two functions for cycling through the E820 map in
order to count to be remapped pages and remap them later, just use one
function with a caller supplied sub-function called for each region to
be processed. This eliminates the possibility of a mismatch between
both loops which showed up in certain configurations.
