gso: Remove arbitrary checks for unsupported GSO

In several gso_segment functions there are checks of gso_type against
a seemingly arbitrary list of SKB_GSO_* flags. This seems like an
attempt to identify unsupported GSO types, but since the stack is
the one that set these GSO types in the first place this seems
unnecessary to do. If a combination isn't valid in the first
place that stack should not allow setting it.

This is a code simplication especially for add new GSO types.
