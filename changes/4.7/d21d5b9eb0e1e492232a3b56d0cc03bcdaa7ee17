scripts/gdb: fix issue with dmesg.py and python 3.X

When built against Python 3, GDB differs in the return type for its
read_memory function, causing the lx-dmesg command to fail.

Now that we have an improved read_16() we can use the new
read_memoryview() abstraction to make lx-dmesg return valid data on both
current Python APIs

Tested with python 3.4 and 2.7
Tested with gdb 7.7
