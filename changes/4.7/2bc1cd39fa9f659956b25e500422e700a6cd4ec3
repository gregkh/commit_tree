x86/boot: Clean up pointer casting

Currently extract_kernel() defines the input and output buffer pointers
as "unsigned char *" since that's effectively what they are. It passes
these to the decompressor routine and to the ELF parser, which both
logically deal with buffer pointers too. There is some casting ("unsigned
long") done to validate the numerical value of the pointers, but it is
relatively limited.

However, choose_random_location() operates almost exclusively on the
numerical representation of these pointers, so it ended up carrying
a lot of "unsigned long" casts. With the future physical/virtual split
these casts were going to multiply, so this attempts to solve the
problem by doing all the casting in choose_random_location()'s entry
and return instead of through-out the code. Adjusts argument names to
be more meaningful, and changes one us of "choice" to "output" to make
the future physical/virtual split more clear (i.e. "choice" should be
strictly a function return value and not used as an intermediate).
