ARM: dts: imx6dl: Fix the VDD_ARM_CAP voltage for 396MHz operation

Table 8 from MX6DL datasheet (IMX6SDLCEC Rev. 5, 06/2015):
http://cache.nxp.com/files/32bit/doc/data_sheet/IMX6SDLCEC.pdf

states the following:

"LDO Output Set Point (VDD_ARM_CAP) = 1.125 V minimum for operation
up to 396 MHz."

So fix the entry by adding the 25mV margin value as done in the other
entries of the table, which results in 1.15V for 396MHz operation.
