perf tools: Introduce trigger class

Use 'trigger' to model operations which need to be executed when an
event (a signal, for example) is observed.

States and transits:

 OFF--(on)--> READY --(hit)--> HIT
		^               |
		|            (ready)
		|               |
		 \_____________/

is_hit and is_ready are two key functions to query the state of a
trigger. is_hit means the event already happen; is_ready means the
trigger is waiting for the event.
