IB/core: Fix no default GIDs when netdevice reregisters

Currently, when the netdevice returned by get_netdev is unregistered,
we delete all GIDs (including the default GIDs) and reset their
attributes. Therefore, when we re-register it, no default GIDs
will be assigned (as their "default GID") attribute will be reset.
Fixing this by keeping "default GID" attribute.
