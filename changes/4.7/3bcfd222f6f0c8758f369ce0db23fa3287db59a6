ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Break out I2C support into separate module

To prepare for abstracting adding SPI support, the I2C pieces needs to
be in its own moudle.  This patch moves common probe code into aic32x4_probe
and common removal code into aic32x4_remove.  It also creates a static
regmap config structure to be copied in the I2C specific driver.
