time: add missing implementation for timespec64_add_safe()

timespec64_add_safe() has been defined in time64.h for 64 bit systems.
But, 32 bit systems only have an extern function prototype defined.
Provide a definition for the above function.

The function will be necessary as part of y2038 changes.  struct
timespec is not y2038 safe.  All references to timespec will be replaced
by struct timespec64.  The function is meant to be a replacement for
timespec_add_safe().

The implementation is similar to timespec_add_safe().
