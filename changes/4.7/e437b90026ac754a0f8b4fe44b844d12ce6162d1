regulator: core: Remove duplicate copy of active-discharge parsing

Apparently due to a wrongly resolved merge conflict between two
branches, which contained the same commit, the commit contents
partially was added two times in a row.

This change reverts the latter wrong inclusion of commit 909f7ee0b5f3
("regulator: core: Add support for active-discharge configuration").

The first applied commit 670666b9e0af ("regulator: core: Add support
for active-discharge configuration") is not touched.
