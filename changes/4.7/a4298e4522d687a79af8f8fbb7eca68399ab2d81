net: add SOCK_RCU_FREE socket flag

We want a generic way to insert an RCU grace period before socket
freeing for cases where RCU_SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is adding too
much overhead.

SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU strict rules force us to take a reference
on the socket sk_refcnt, and it is a performance problem for UDP
encapsulation, or TCP synflood behavior, as many CPUs might
attempt the atomic operations on a shared sk_refcnt

UDP sockets and TCP listeners can set SOCK_RCU_FREE so that their
lookup can use traditional RCU rules, without refcount changes.
They can set the flag only once hashed and visible by other cpus.
