If the node received RESYNCING message which means
another node will perform resync with the area, then

Let's set RESYNC_MASK and clear NEEDED_MASK for the
region from old-low to new-low which has finished
syncing, and the region from old-hi to new-hi is about
to syncing, bitmap_sync_with_cluste is introduced for
the purpose.
