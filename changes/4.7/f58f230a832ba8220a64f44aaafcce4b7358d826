x86/efi: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

efi_alloc_page_tables uses __GFP_REPEAT but it allocates an order-0
page.  This means that this flag has never been actually useful here
because it has always been used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
