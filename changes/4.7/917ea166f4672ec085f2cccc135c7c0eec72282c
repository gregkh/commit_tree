<linux/sunrpc/svcauth.h>: Define hash_str() in terms of hashlen_string()

Finally, the first use of previous two patches: eliminate the
separate ad-hoc string hash functions in the sunrpc code.

Now hash_str() is a wrapper around hash_string(), and hash_mem() is
likewise a wrapper around full_name_hash().

Note that sunrpc code *does* call hash_mem() with a zero length, which
is why the previous patch needed to handle that in full_name_hash().
(Thanks, Bruce, for finding that!)

This also eliminates the only caller of hash_long which asks for
more than 32 bits of output.

The comment about the quality of hashlen_string() and full_name_hash()
is jumping the gun by a few patches; they aren't very impressive now,
but will be improved greatly later in the series.
