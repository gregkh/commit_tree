crypto: vmx - Increase priority of aes-cbc cipher

All of the VMX AES ciphers (AES, AES-CBC and AES-CTR) are set at
priority 1000. Unfortunately this means we never use AES-CBC and
AES-CTR, because the base AES-CBC cipher that is implemented on
top of AES inherits its priority.

To fix this, AES-CBC and AES-CTR have to be a higher priority. Set
them to 2000.

Testing on a POWER8 with:

cryptsetup benchmark --cipher aes --key-size 256

Shows decryption speed increase from 402.4 MB/s to 3069.2 MB/s,
over 7x faster. Thanks to Mike Strosaker for helping me debug
this issue.
