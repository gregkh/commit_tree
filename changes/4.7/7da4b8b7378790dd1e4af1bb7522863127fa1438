serial: core: Fix port mutex assert if lockdep disabled

commit 4047b37122d1 ("serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access,
part 1") added lockdep assertion for port mutex but fails to check
if debug_locks has disabled lockdep (so lock state is no longer
reliable).

Use lockdep_assert_held() instead, which properly checks lockdep
state as well.
