mm, hugetlb_cgroup: round limit_in_bytes down to hugepage size

The page_counter rounds limits down to page size values.  This makes
sense, except in the case of hugetlb_cgroup where it's not possible to
charge partial hugepages.  If the hugetlb_cgroup margin is less than the
hugepage size being charged, it will fail as expected.

Round the hugetlb_cgroup limit down to hugepage size, since it is the
effective limit of the cgroup.

For consistency, round down PAGE_COUNTER_MAX as well when a
hugetlb_cgroup is created: this prevents error reports when a user
cannot restore the value to the kernel default.
