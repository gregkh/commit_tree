ARM: memremap: implement arch_memremap_wb()

The generic memremap() falls back to using ioremap_cache() to create
MEMREMAP_WB mappings if the requested region is not already covered
by the linear mapping, unless the architecture provides an implementation
of arch_memremap_wb().

Since ioremap_cache() is not appropriate on ARM to map memory with the
same attributes used for the linear mapping, implement arch_memremap_wb()
which does exactly that. Also, relax the WARN() check to allow MT_MEMORY_RW
mappings of pfn_valid() pages.
