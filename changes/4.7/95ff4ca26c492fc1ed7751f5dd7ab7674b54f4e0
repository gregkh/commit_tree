perf/core: Free AUX pages in unmap path

Now that we can ensure that when ring buffer's AUX area is on the way
to getting unmapped new transactions won't start, we only need to stop
all events that can potentially be writing aux data to our ring buffer.

Having done that, we can safely free the AUX pages and corresponding
PMU data, as this time it is guaranteed to be the last aux reference
holder.

This partially reverts:

  57ffc5ca679 ("perf: Fix AUX buffer refcounting")

... which was made to defer deallocation that was otherwise possible
from an NMI context. Now it is no longer the case; the last call to
rb_free_aux() that drops the last AUX reference has to happen in
perf_mmap_close() on that AUX area.
