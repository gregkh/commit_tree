xen/pciback: Fix conf_space read/write overlap check.

Current overlap check is evaluating to false a case where a filter
field is fully contained (proper subset) of a r/w request.  This
change applies classical overlap check instead to include all the
scenarios.

More specifically, for (Hilscher GmbH CIFX 50E-DP(M/S)) device driver
the logic is such that the entire confspace is read and written in 4
byte chunks. In this case as an example, CACHE_LINE_SIZE,
LATENCY_TIMER and PCI_BIST are arriving together in one call to
xen_pcibk_config_write() with offset == 0xc and size == 4.  With the
exsisting overlap check the LATENCY_TIMER field (offset == 0xd, length
== 1) is fully contained in the write request and hence is excluded
from write, which is incorrect.
