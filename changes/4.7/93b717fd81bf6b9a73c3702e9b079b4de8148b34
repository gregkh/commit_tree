NFSv4: Label stateids with the type

In order to more easily distinguish what kind of stateid we are dealing
with, introduce a type that can be used to label the stateid structure.

The label will be useful both for debugging, but also when dealing with
operations like SETATTR, READ and WRITE that can take several different
types of stateid as arguments.
