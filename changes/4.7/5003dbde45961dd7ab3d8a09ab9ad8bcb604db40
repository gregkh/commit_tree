arm64: Add new asm macro copy_page

Kexec and hibernate need to copy pages of memory, but may not have all
of the kernel mapped, and are unable to call copy_page().

Add a simplistic copy_page() macro, that can be inlined in these
situations. lib/copy_page.S provides a bigger better version, but
uses more registers.
