serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part 1

uart_remove_one_port() may race with every serial core operation
requiring a valid dereference of state->uart_port. In particular,
uart_remove_one_port() may unlink the uart port concurrently with
any serial core operation that may dereference same.

Ensure safe dereference for those operations that already claim
the port->mutex, and extend that guarantee for trivial cases,
such as the ioctl handlers. Introduce the uart_port_check() helper
which asserts port->mutex is held (only when lockdep is on).

For ioctls, return -EIO as if the port has been hung up (since it has).
