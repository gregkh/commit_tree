gpio: 104-dio-48e: Fix control port offset computation off-by-one error

There are only two control ports, each controlling three distinct I/O
ports. To compute the control port address offset for a respective I/O
port, the I/O port address offset should be divided by 3; dividing by 2
may result in not only the wrong address offset but possibly also an
out-of-bounds array memory access for a non-existent third control port.
