i40e: Test memory before ethtool alloc succeeds

When testing on systems with very limited amounts of RAM, a bug was
found where, while changing the number of descriptors using ethtool,
the driver didn't test the limits of system memory before permanently
assuming it would be able to get receive buffer memory.

Work around this issue by pre-allocation of the receive buffer
memory, in the "ghost" ring, which is then used during reinit
using the new ring length.
