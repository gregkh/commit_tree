serial: 8250_pci: fix divide error bug if baud rate is 0

Since commit 21947ba654a6 ("serial: 8250_pci: replace switch-case by
formula"), the 8250 driver crashes in the byt_set_termios() function
with a divide error. This is caused by the fact that a baud rate of 0 (B0)
is not handled properly. Fix it by falling back to B9600 in this case.
