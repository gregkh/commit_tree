coresight: tmc: waiting for TMCReady bit before programming

According to the TRM before programming the TMC in circular
buffer mode (and that for any configuration, ETB, ETR, ETF),
the TMCReady bit in the status register has to be set.

This patch adds a check to make sure the state machine is in
a state where it can be configured, and complains otherwise.
