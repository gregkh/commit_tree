pnfs: lift retry logic from send_layoutget to pnfs_update_layout

If we get back something like NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID, that will be
translated into -EAGAIN, and the do/while loop in send_layoutget
will drive the call again.

This is not quite what we want, I think. An error like that is a
sign that something has changed. That something could have been a
concurrent LAYOUTGET that would give us a usable lseg.

Lift the retry logic into pnfs_update_layout instead. That allows
us to redo the layout search, and may spare us from having to issue
an RPC.
