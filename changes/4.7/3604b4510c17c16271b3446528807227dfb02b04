MIPS: BMIPS: Add BCM6358 support

BCM6358 has a shared TLB which conflicts with current SMP support, so it must
be disabled for now.
BCM6358 uses >= 0xfffe0000 addresses for internal registers, which need to be
remapped (by using a simplified version of BRCM63xx ioremap.h).
However, 0xfff80000 is a better address, since it also covers BCM3368, leaving
the possibility to add it in the future.
