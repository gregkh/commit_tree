batman-adv: Fix ICMP RR ethernet access after skb_linearize

The skb_linearize may reallocate the skb. This makes the calculated pointer
for ethhdr invalid. But it the pointer is used later to fill in the RR
field of the batadv_icmp_packet_rr packet.

Instead re-evaluate eth_hdr after the skb_linearize+skb_cow to fix the
pointer and avoid the invalid read.
