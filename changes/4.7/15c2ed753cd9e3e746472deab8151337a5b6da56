batman-adv: Fix reference leak in batadv_find_router

The replacement of last_bonding_candidate in batadv_orig_node has to be an
atomic operation. Otherwise it is possible that the reference counter of a
batadv_orig_ifinfo is reduced which was no longer the
last_bonding_candidate when the new candidate is added. This can either
lead to an invalid memory access or to reference leaks which make it
impossible to an interface which was added to batman-adv.
