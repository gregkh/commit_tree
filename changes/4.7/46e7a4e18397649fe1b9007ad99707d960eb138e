PM / OPP: Mark shared-opp for non-dt case

opp core allows OPPs to be explicitly marked as shared from platform
code, in case of operating-point v1 bindings.

Though we do everything fine in that case, we don't set the flag in the
opp-table to indicate that the OPPs are shared. It works fine today as
the flag isn't used anywhere else in the core, but we should be doing
the right thing by marking it set.
