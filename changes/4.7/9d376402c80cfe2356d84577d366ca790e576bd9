g_ncr5380: Remove CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR53C400

This change brings a number of improvements: fewer macros, better test
coverage, simpler code and sane Kconfig options. The downside is a small
chance of incompatibility (which seems unavoidable).

CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR53C400 exists to enable or inhibit pseudo DMA
transfers when the driver is used with 53C400-compatible cards. Thanks to
Ondrej Zary's patches, PDMA now works which means it can be enabled
unconditionally.

Due to bad design, CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR53C400 ties together unrelated
functionality as it sets both PSEUDO_DMA and BIOSPARAM macros. This patch
effectively enables PSEUDO_DMA and disables BIOSPARAM.

The defconfigs and the Kconfig default leave CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR53C400
undefined. Red Hat 9 and CentOS 2.1 were the same. This leaves both
PSEUDO_DMA and BIOSPARAM disabled. The effect of this patch should be
better performance from enabling PSEUDO_DMA.

On the other hand, Debian 4 and SLES 10 had CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR53C400
enabled, so both PSEUDO_DMA and BIOSPARAM were enabled. This patch might
affect configurations like this by disabling BIOSPARAM. My best guess is
that this could be a problem only in the vanishingly rare case that
1) the CHS values stored in the boot device partition table are wrong and
2) a 5380 card is in use (because PDMA on 53C400 used to be broken).
