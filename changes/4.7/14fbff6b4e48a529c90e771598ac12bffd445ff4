samples: connector: from Documentation to samples directory

A small bug with the new autoksyms support showed that there are
two kernel modules in the Documentation directory that qualify
as samples, while all other samples are in the samples/ directory.

This patch was originally meant as a workaround for that bug, but
it has now been solved in a different way. However, I still think
it makes sense as a cleanup to consolidate all sample code in
one place.
