tracing: Add hist trigger support for compound keys

Allow users to specify multiple trace event fields to use in keys by
allowing multiple fields in the 'keys=' keyword.  With this addition,
any unique combination of any of the fields named in the 'keys'
keyword will result in a new entry being added to the hash table.
