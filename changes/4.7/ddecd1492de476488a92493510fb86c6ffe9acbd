ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Calculate AUXCLK divider when setting up master clocks

If the McASP is used as clock master and the reference clock is AUXCLK we
can have additional level of divider. The BCLK divider is limited to
maximum 32, if the desired bclk can not be reached with this, the AUXCLK
divider also needs to be used.
