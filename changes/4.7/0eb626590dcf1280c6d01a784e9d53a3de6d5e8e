IB/hfi1: Remove multiple device cdev

hfi1 current exports a cdev that can be used to target all of the hfi's
in the system. However there is a problem with this approach in
that the devices could be on different subnets. This is a problem that
user space can figure out and explicitly tell the driver on which device
to create a context.

Remove the multi-purpose cdev leaving a dedicated cdev for each port.
Also remove the striping capability that is dependent upon the user
choosing the multi-purpose cdev. It is now up to user space to determine
how to stripe contexts.
