drm/dp: Allow signals to interrupt drm_aux-dev reads/writes

Let's be nice and interrupt the dpcd aux-dev reads/writes when there's
a signal pending. Much nicer if the user can hit ^C instead of having to
sit around waiting for the read/write to finish.

time dd if=/dev/drm_dp_aux0 bs=$((1024*1024))
^C

before:
 real	0m34.681s
 user	0m0.003s
 sys	0m6.880s

after:
 real	0m0.222s
 user	0m0.006s
 sys	0m0.057s
