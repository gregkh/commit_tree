switchdev: Use switch ID in suggested udev rule

Since there can be multiple switch ASICs on the same system we should
use the switch ID in order to differentiate between them and set the
switch name (e.g. swX) accordingly.

Also, replace the order of the "Switch ID" and "Port Netdev Naming"
sections following the above change.
