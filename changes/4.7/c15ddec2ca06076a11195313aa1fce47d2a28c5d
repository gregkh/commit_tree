reset: Share struct reset_control between reset_control_get calls

Now that struct reset_control no longer stores the device pointer for
the device calling reset_control_get we can share a single struct
reset_control when multiple calls to reset_control_get are made for
the same reset line (same id / index).

This is a preparation patch for adding support for shared reset lines.
