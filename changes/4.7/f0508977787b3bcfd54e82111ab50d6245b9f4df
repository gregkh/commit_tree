mm, thp: khugepaged should scan when sleep value is written

If a large value is written to scan_sleep_millisecs, for example, that
period must lapse before khugepaged will wake up for periodic
collapsing.

If this value is tuned to 1 day, for example, and then re-tuned to its
default 10s, khugepaged will still wait for a day before scanning again.

This patch causes khugepaged to wakeup immediately when the value is
changed and then sleep until that value is rewritten or the new value
lapses.
