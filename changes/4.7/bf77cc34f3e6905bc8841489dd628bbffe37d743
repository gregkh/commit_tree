ib_pack.h: Add opcode definition for send with invalidate

The opcode for "SEND Last with Invalidate" and "SEND Only with
Invalidate" have been defined for RC in IBA Specification Vol 1
since Release 1.2. Add the definition to the header file in
preparation of supporting these opcodes in rdmavt based drivers.
