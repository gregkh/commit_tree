Revert "Staging: rtl8188eu: rtw_efuse: Use sizeof type *pointer instead of sizeof type."

This reverts commit b5e12ec38331 ("Staging: rtl8188eu: rtw_efuse: Use
sizeof type *pointer instead of sizeof type.").

This commit is wrong, the rtw_malloc2d helper function takes the size of
the array elements as its 3th argument, whereas sizeof(*eFuseWord)
gives the size of a pointer instead of the size of a u16.

Since sizeof(void *) > sizeof(u16) this has no adverse effects, but it
is still wrong.
