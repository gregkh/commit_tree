cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix code ordering in intel_pstate_set_policy()

The limits->max_perf is rounded_up but immediately overwritten by
another assignment to limits->max_perf.

Move that operation to the correct location.

While here also added a pr_debug() call in ->set_policy to aid in
debugging.
