rtc: zynqmp: Update seconds time programming logic

We program RTC time using SET_TIME_WRITE register and read the RTC
current time using CURRENT_TIME register. When we set the time by
writing into SET_TIME_WRITE Register and immediately try to read the
rtc time from CURRENT_TIME register, the previous old value is
returned instead of the new loaded time. This is because RTC takes
nearly 1 sec to update the  new loaded value into the CURRENT_TIME
register. This behaviour is expected in our RTC IP.

This patch updates the driver to read the current time from SET_TIME_WRITE
register instead of CURRENT_TIME when rtc time is requested within an 1sec
period after setting the RTC time. Doing so will ensure the correct time is
given to the user.

Since there is a delay of 1sec in updating the CURRENT_TIME we are loading
set time +1sec while programming the SET_TIME_WRITE register, doing this
will give correct time without any delay when read from CURRENT_TIME.
