net: l3mdev: Move get_saddr and rt6_dst

Move l3mdev_rt6_dst_by_oif and l3mdev_get_saddr to l3mdev.c. Collapse
l3mdev_get_rt6_dst into l3mdev_rt6_dst_by_oif since it is the only
user and keep the l3mdev_get_rt6_dst name for consistency with other
hooks.

A follow-on patch adds more code to these functions making them long
for inlined functions.
