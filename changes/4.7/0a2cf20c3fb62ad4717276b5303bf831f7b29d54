tcp: remove SKBTX_ACK_TSTAMP since it is redundant

The SKBTX_ACK_TSTAMP flag is set in skb_shinfo->tx_flags when
the timestamp of the TCP acknowledgement should be reported on
error queue. Since accessing skb_shinfo is likely to incur a
cache-line miss at the time of receiving the ack, the
txstamp_ack bit was added in tcp_skb_cb, which is set iff
the SKBTX_ACK_TSTAMP flag is set for an skb. This makes
SKBTX_ACK_TSTAMP flag redundant.

Remove the SKBTX_ACK_TSTAMP and instead use the txstamp_ack bit
everywhere.

Note that this frees one bit in shinfo->tx_flags.
