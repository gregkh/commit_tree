staging: lustre: ldlm: use accessor macros for l_flags

Convert most of the ldlm lock's l_flags references from direct
bit twiddling to using bit specific macros.  A few multi-bit
operations are left as an exercise for the reader.

The changes are mostly in ldlm, but also in llite, osc and quota.
Also add a multi-bit (mask) test.
