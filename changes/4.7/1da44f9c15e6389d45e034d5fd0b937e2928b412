ipv6: Change "final" protocol processing for encapsulation

When performing foo-over-UDP, UDP packets are processed by the
encapsulation handler which returns another protocol to process.
This may result in processing two (or more) protocols in the
loop that are marked as INET6_PROTO_FINAL. The actions taken
for hitting a final protocol, in particular the skb_postpull_rcsum
can only be performed once.

This patch set adds a check of a final protocol has been seen. The
rules are:
  - If the final protocol has not been seen any protocol is processed
    (final and non-final). In the case of a final protocol, the final
    actions are taken (like the skb_postpull_rcsum)
  - If a final protocol has been seen (e.g. an encapsulating UDP
    header) then no further non-final protocols are allowed
    (e.g. extension headers). For more final protocols the
    final actions are not taken (e.g. skb_postpull_rcsum).
