KVM: x86: optimize steal time calculation

Since accumulate_steal_time is now only called in record_steal_time, it
doesn't quite make sense to put the delta calculation in a separate
function. The function could be called thousands of times before guest
enables the steal time MSR (though the compiler may optimize out this
function call). And after it's enabled, the MSR enable bit is tested twice
every time. Removing the accumulate_steal_time function also avoids the
necessity of having the accum_steal field.
