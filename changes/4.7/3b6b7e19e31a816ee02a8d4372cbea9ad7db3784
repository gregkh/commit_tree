iommu/dma: Finish optimising higher-order allocations

Now that we know exactly which page sizes our caller wants to use in the
given domain, we can restrict higher-order allocation attempts to just
those sizes, if any, and avoid wasting any time or effort on other sizes
which offer no benefit. In the same vein, this also lets us accommodate
a minimum order greater than 0 for special cases.
