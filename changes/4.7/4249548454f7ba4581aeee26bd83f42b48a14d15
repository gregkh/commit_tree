MIPS: ptrace: Fix FP context restoration FCSR regression

Fix a floating-point context restoration regression introduced with
commit 9b26616c8d9d ("MIPS: Respect the ISA level in FCSR handling")
that causes a Floating Point exception and consequently a kernel oops
with hard float configurations when one or more FCSR Enable and their
corresponding Cause bits are set both at a time via a ptrace(2) call.

To do so reinstate Cause bit masking originally introduced with commit
b1442d39fac2 ("MIPS: Prevent user from setting FCSR cause bits") to
address this exact problem and then inadvertently removed from the
PTRACE_SETFPREGS request with the commit referred above.
