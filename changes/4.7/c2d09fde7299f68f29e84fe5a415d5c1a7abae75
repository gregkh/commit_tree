xen-netback: use hash value from the frontend

My recent patch to include/xen/interface/io/netif.h defines a new extra
info type that can be used to pass hash values between backend and guest
frontend.

This patch adds code to xen-netback to use the value in a hash extra
info fragment passed from the guest frontend in a transmit-side
(i.e. netback receive side) packet to set the skb hash accordingly.
