irqchip: Add LPC32xx interrupt controller driver

The change adds improved support of NXP LPC32xx MIC, SIC1 and SIC2
interrupt controllers.

This is a list of new features in comparison to the legacy driver:
* irq types are taken from device tree settings, no more need to
  hardcode them,
* old driver is based on irq_domain_add_legacy, which causes problems
  with handling MIC hardware interrupt 0 produced by SIC1,
* there is one driver for MIC, SIC1 and SIC2, no more need to handle
  them separately, e.g. have two separate handlers for SIC1 and SIC2,
* the driver does not have any dependencies on hardcoded register
  offsets,
* the driver is much simpler for maintenance,
* SPARSE_IRQS option is supported.

Legacy LPC32xx interrupt controller driver was broken since commit
76ba59f8366f ("genirq: Add irq_domain-aware core IRQ handler"), which
requires a private interrupt handler, otherwise any SIC1 generated
interrupt (mapped to MIC hwirq 0) breaks the kernel with the message
"unexpected IRQ trap at vector 00".

The change disables compilation of a legacy driver found at
arch/arm/mach-lpc32xx/irq.c, the file will be removed in a separate
commit.
