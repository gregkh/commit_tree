ath10k: add dynamic tx mode switch config support for qca4019

push-pull mode needs certain amount the host driver involvement for
managing queues in the host memory and packet delivery to firmware.
qca4019 wifi firmware has an option to stay in push mode for less
number of active traffic flow and then switch to push-pull mode when
the active traffic flow goes beyond the certain limit.

The advantage of staying in push mode for less active traffic is, the
host cpu consumption is reduced. qca4019 firmware supports this
flexibility of the mode switch. It takes the host driver interest
(LOW_PERF/HIGH_PERF) via WMI_EXT_RESOURCE_CFG_CMDID,

 LOW_PERF  - fw would stay in push mode and switch to push-pull
               based on demand.
 HIGH_PERF - fw would stay in push-pull mode from the boot.

To make this configuration generic, new WMI services
WMI_SERVICE_TX_MODE_PUSH_ONLY, WMI_SERVICE_TX_MODE_PUSH_PULL,
WMI_SERVICE_TX_MODE_DYNAMIC are introduced to take dynamic tx mode
switch support availability in firmware.
Based on WMI_SERVICE_TX_MODE_DYNAMIC, LOW_PERF or HIGHT_PERF is
configured to the firmware.
