irqchip/gic: Remove static irq_chip definition for eoimode1

There are only 3 differences (not including the name) in the definitions
of the gic_chip and gic_eoimode1_chip structures. Instead of statically
defining the gic_eoimode1_chip structure, remove it and populate the
eoimode1 functions dynamically for the appropriate GIC irqchips.
