isa: Allow ISA-style drivers on modern systems

Several modern devices, such as PC/104 cards, are expected to run on
modern systems via an ISA bus interface. Since ISA is a legacy interface
for most modern architectures, ISA support should remain disabled in
general. Support for ISA-style drivers should be enabled on a per driver
basis.

To allow ISA-style drivers on modern systems, this patch introduces the
ISA_BUS_API and ISA_BUS Kconfig options. The ISA bus driver will now
build conditionally on the ISA_BUS_API Kconfig option, which defaults to
the legacy ISA Kconfig option. The ISA_BUS Kconfig option allows the
ISA_BUS_API Kconfig option to be selected on architectures which do not
enable ISA (e.g. X86_64).

The ISA_BUS Kconfig option is currently only implemented for X86
architectures. Other architectures may have their own ISA_BUS Kconfig
options added as required.
