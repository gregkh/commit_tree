iio: inv_mpu6050: Cleanup hw_info mapping

The hw_info array was indexed by enum inv_devices chip_type despite the
fact that the enumeration had more members than the array and was
ordered differently.

The patch cleans this up and adds explicit chip_types to i2c/spi/acpi
IDs. It also adds some stricter checks inside the driver core.

This happened to work so far because the differences between the
supported models are very minor.
