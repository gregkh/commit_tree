can: fix handling of unmodifiable configuration options

As described in 'can: m_can: tag current CAN FD controllers as non-ISO'
(6cfda7fbebe) it is possible to define fixed configuration options by
setting the according bit in 'ctrlmode' and clear it in 'ctrlmode_supported'.
This leads to the incovenience that the fixed configuration bits can not be
passed by netlink even when they have the correct values (e.g. non-ISO, FD).

This patch fixes that issue and not only allows fixed set bit values to be set
again but now requires(!) to provide these fixed values at configuration time.
A valid CAN FD configuration consists of a nominal/arbitration bittiming, a
data bittiming and a control mode with CAN_CTRLMODE_FD set - which is now
enforced by a new can_validate() function. This fix additionally removed the
inconsistency that was prohibiting the support of 'CANFD-only' controller
drivers, like the RCar CAN FD.

For this reason a new helper can_set_static_ctrlmode() has been introduced to
provide a proper interface to handle static enabled CAN controller options.
