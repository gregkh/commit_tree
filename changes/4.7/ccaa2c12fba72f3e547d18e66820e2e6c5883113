drm/radeon: do not hard reset GPU while freezing on r600/r700 family

Seems r600/r700 does not like hard reset while freezing for hibernation
(regression due to 274ad65c9d02bdcbee9bae045517864c3521d530 which itself
is a fix for hibernation on some GPU families). Until i can debug further
issue with r600, let just disable this for r600/r700 as they are very
similar family and bug affecting one likely affect the other.
