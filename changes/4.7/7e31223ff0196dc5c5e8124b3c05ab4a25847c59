[media] i2c: saa7115: Support CJC7113 detection

It's been reported that CJC7113 devices are returning
all 1s when reading register 0:

  "1111111111111111" found @ 0x4a (stk1160)

This new device is apparently compatible with SA7113, so let's
add a quirk to allow its autodetection. Given there isn't
any known differences with SAA7113, this commit does not
introduces a new saa711x_model value.
