sched/migration: Move CPU_ONLINE into scheduler state

The alleged requirement that the migration notifier has a lower priority than
perf is completely undocumented and there is no indication at all that this is
true. perf does not even handle the CPU_ONLINE notification and perf really
has nothing to do with migration.

Move the CPU_ONLINE code into the sched_activate_cpu() state callback.
