scsi: reduce CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS=y impact by 8k

On 64 bit, struct error_info has 6 bytes of padding, which amounts to
over 4k of wasted space in the additional[] array. We could easily get
rid of that by instead using separate arrays for the codes and the
pointers. However, we can do even better than that and save an
additional 6 bytes per entry: In the table, just store the sizeof()
the corresponding string literal. The cumulative sum of these is then
the appropriate offset into additional_text, which is built from the
concatenation (with '\0's inbetween) of the strings.

The Kconfig help text used to say that CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS=y costs
around 75 KB, but that was a little exaggerated. The actual number was
closer to 44K, and 36K with this patch.
