ip6gre: Add support for GSO

This patch adds code borrowed from bits and pieces of other protocols to
the IPv6 GRE path so that we can support GSO over IPv6 based GRE tunnels.
By adding this support we are able to significantly improve the throughput
for GRE tunnels as we are able to make use of GSO.
