dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: clear BAM interrupt only if it is raised

Currently we write BAM_IRQ_CLR register with zero even when no
BAM_IRQ occured. This write has some bad side effects when the
BAM instance is for the crypto engine. In case of crypto engine
some of the BAM registers are xPU protected and they cannot be
controlled by the driver.
