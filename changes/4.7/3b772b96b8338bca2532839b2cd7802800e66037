tracing: Update some tracing_map constants and comments

Make it clear exactly how many keys and values are supported through
better defines, and add 1 to the vals count, since normally clients
want support for at least a hitcount and two other values.

Also, note the error return value for tracing_map_add_key/val_field()
in the comments.
