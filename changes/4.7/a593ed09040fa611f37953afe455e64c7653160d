ASoC: tas571x: added missing register literals

The list of TAS571x registers was incomplete.
Added the missing register definitions up to the register 0x25.
Added volatile and read-only register tables into tas5711_regmap_config
and tas5717_regmap_config.

The chip has 256 registers in total. But from address 0x29 on
(0x26 to 0x28 are reserved) the register width varies between
20, 12 and 8 bytes, which the register map cannot represent.
