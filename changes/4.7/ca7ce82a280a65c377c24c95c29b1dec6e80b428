perf tests: Do not use sizeof on pointer type

Using sizeof on a malloced pointer type will return the wordsize which
can often cause one to allocate a buffer much smaller than it is needed.
So, here do not use sizeof on pointer type.

Note that this has no effect on runtime because 'dsos' is a pointer to a
pointer.

Problem found using Coccinelle.
