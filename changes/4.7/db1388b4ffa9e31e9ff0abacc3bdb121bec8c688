tracing: Add support for named triggers

Named triggers are sets of triggers that share a common set of trigger
data.  An example of functionality that could benefit from this type
of capability would be a set of inlined probes that would each
contribute event counts, for example, to a shared counter data
structure.

The first named trigger registered with a given name owns the common
trigger data that the others subsequently registered with the same
name will reference.  The functions defined here allow users to add,
delete, and find named triggers.

It also adds functions to pause and unpause named triggers; since
named triggers act upon common data, they should also be paused and
unpaused as a group.
