ALSA: bebob: drop reuse of incoming packet parameter for outgoing packet parameter

Windows driver for BeBoB-based models mostly wait for transmitted packets,
then transfer packets to the models. This looks for the relationship
between incoming packets and outgoing packets to synchronize the sequence
of presentation timestamp.

However, the sequence between packets of both direction has no
relationship. Even if receiving NO-DATA packets, the drivers transfer
packets with meaningful value in SYT field. Additionally, the order of
starting packets is always the same, independently of the source of clock.
The corresponding driver is expected as a generator of presentation
timestamp and these models can select it as a source of sampling clock.

This commit drops reusing SYT sequence from ALSA bebob driver. The driver
always transfer packets with presentation timestamp generated by ALSA
firewire stack, without re-using the sequence of value in SYT field in
incoming packets to outgoing packets.
