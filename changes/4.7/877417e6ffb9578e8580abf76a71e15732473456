Kbuild: change CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE definition

CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE disables the often useful -Wmaybe-unused warning,
because that causes a ridiculous amount of false positives when combined
with -Os.

This means a lot of warnings don't show up in testing by the developers
that should see them with an 'allmodconfig' kernel that has
CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE enabled, but only later in randconfig builds
that don't.

This changes the Kconfig logic around CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE to make
it a 'choice' statement defaulting to CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE
that gets added for this purpose. The allmodconfig and allyesconfig
kernels now default to -O2 with the maybe-unused warning enabled.
