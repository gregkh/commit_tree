ncr5380: Call complete_cmd() for disconnected commands on bus reset

I'm told that some targets are liable to disconnect a REQUEST SENSE
command. Theoretically this would cause a command undergoing autosense to
be moved onto the disconnected list. The bus reset handler must call
complete_cmd() for these commands, otherwise the hostdata->sensing pointer
will not get cleared. That would cause autosense processing to stall and
a timeout or an incorrect scsi_eh_restore_cmnd() would eventually follow.
