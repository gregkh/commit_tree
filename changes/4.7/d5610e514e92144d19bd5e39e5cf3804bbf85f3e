gpio: mb86s7x: make explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config GPIO_MB86S7X
        bool "GPIO support for Fujitsu MB86S7x Platforms"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the couple traces of modularity, so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
