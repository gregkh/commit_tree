gso: Only allow GSO_PARTIAL if we can checksum the inner protocol

This patch addresses a possible issue that can occur if we get into any odd
corner cases where we support TSO for a given protocol but not the checksum
or scatter-gather offload.  There are few drivers floating around that
setup their tunnels this way and by enforcing the checksum piece we can
avoid mangling any frames.
