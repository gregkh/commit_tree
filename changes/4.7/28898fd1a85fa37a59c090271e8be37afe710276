checkpatch: improve --git <commit-count> shortcut

The --git <commit-count> shortcut can be confused by a tag with a dash
like v4.4-rc1.

Improve the test to verify the <commit-count> expression ends with a
dash followed by a numeric value.

Improve the git log result to verify the "<sha1> <subject>" output
as well.
