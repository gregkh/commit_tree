drm/i915: Codify our assumption that the Global GTT is <= 4GiB

Throughout the code base, we use u32 for offsets into the global GTT. If
we ever see any hardware with a larger GGTT, then we run the real risk
of silent corruption. So test for our assumption up front so that we
have a nice reminder should the time come when it fails.
