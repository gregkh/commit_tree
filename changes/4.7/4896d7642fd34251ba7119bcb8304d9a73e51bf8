iwlwifi: consider VHT 160MHz while parsing NVM

Devices belonging to 9000 family can support VHT 160MHz channel
width, so need to consider it when configuring VHT capabilities.
However, NVM file doesn't have a single bit specifying that 160MHz
is supported. This patch turns on 160MHz support in VHT capabilities
in case there's at least one channel supporting 160MHz.
