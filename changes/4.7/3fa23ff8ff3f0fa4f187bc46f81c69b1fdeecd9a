powerpc/powernv: Fix initial IO and M32 segmap

There are two arrays for IO and M32 segment maps on every PHB.
The index of the arrays are segment number and the value stored
in the corresponding element is PE number, indicating the segment
is assigned to the PE. Initially, all elements in those two arrays
are zeroes, meaning all segments are assigned to PE#0. It's wrong.

This fixes the initial values in the elements of those two arrays
to IODA_INVALID_PE, meaning all segments aren't assigned to any
PE.
