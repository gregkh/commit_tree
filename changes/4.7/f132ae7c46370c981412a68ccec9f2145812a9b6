gre: change gre_parse_header to return the header length

It's easier for gre_parse_header to return the header length instead of
filing it into a parameter. That way, the callers that don't care about the
header length can just check whether the returned value is lower than zero.

In gre_err, the tunnel header must not be pulled. See commit b7f8fe251e46
("gre: do not pull header in ICMP error processing") for details.

This patch reduces the conflict between the mentioned commit and commit
95f5c64c3c13 ("gre: Move utility functions to common headers").
