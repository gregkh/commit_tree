xen-netback: pass hash value to the frontend

My recent patch to include/xen/interface/io/netif.h defines a new extra
info type that can be used to pass hash values between backend and guest
frontend.

This patch adds code to xen-netback to pass hash values calculated for
guest receive-side packets (i.e. netback transmit side) to the frontend.
