iwlwifi: store fw memory segments length and addresses in run-time

Currently reading the fw memory segments is done according to
addresses and data length that are hard-coded.
Lately a new tlv was appended to the ucode, that contains
the data type, length and address.
Parse this tlv, and in run-time store the memory segments length
and addresses that would be dumped upon a fw error.
