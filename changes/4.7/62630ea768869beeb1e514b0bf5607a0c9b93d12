Revert "HID: multitouch: enable palm rejection if device implements confidence usage"

This reverts commit 25a84db15b3f ("HID: multitouch: enable palm rejection
if device implements confidence usage")

The commit enables palm rejection for Win8 Precision Touchpad devices but
the quirk MT_QUIRK_VALID_IS_CONFIDENCE it is using is not working very
properly. This quirk is originally designed for some WIn7 touchscreens. Use
of this for a Win8 Precision Touchpad will cause unexpected pointer jumping
problem.
