MIPS: Separate XPA CPU feature into LPA and MVH

XPA (eXtended Physical Addressing) should be detected as a combination
of two architectural features:
- Large Physical Address (as per Config3.LPA). With XPA this will be set
  on MIPS32r5 cores, but it may also be set for MIPS64r2 cores too.
- MTHC0/MFHC0 instructions (as per Config5.MVH). With XPA this will be
  set, but it may also be set in VZ guest context even when Config3.LPA
  in the guest context has been cleared by the hypervisor.

As such, XPA is only usable if both bits are set. Update CPU features to
separate these two features, with cpu_has_xpa requiring both to be set.
