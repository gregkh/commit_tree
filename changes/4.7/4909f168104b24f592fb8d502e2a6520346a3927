debugfs: unproxify integer attribute files

Currently, the struct file_operations associated with the integer attribute
style files created through the debugfs_create_*() helpers are not file
lifetime aware as they are defined by means of DEFINE_SIMPLE_ATTRIBUTE().

Thus, a lifetime managing proxy is created around the original fops each
time such a file is opened which is an unnecessary waste of resources.

Migrate all usages of DEFINE_SIMPLE_ATTRIBUTE() within debugfs itself
to DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE() in order to implement file lifetime managing
within the struct file_operations thus defined.

Introduce the debugfs_create_mode_unsafe() helper, analogous to
debugfs_create_mode(), but distinct in that it creates the files in
non-proxying operation mode through debugfs_create_file_unsafe().

Feed all struct file_operations migrated to DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE()
into debugfs_create_mode_unsafe() instead of former debugfs_create_mode().
