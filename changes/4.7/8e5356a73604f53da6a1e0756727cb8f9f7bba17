regulator: core: Clear the supply pointer if enabling fails

During the resolution of a regulator's supply, we may attempt to enable
the supply if the regulator itself is already enabled. If enabling the
supply fails, then we will call _regulator_put() for the supply.
However, the pointer to the supply has not been cleared for the
regulator and this will cause a crash if we then unregister the
regulator and attempt to call regulator_put() a second time for the
supply. Fix this by clearing the supply pointer if enabling the supply
after fails when resolving the supply for a regulator.
