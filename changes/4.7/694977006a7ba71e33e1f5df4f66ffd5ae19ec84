MIPS: Use enums to make asm/pgtable-bits.h readable

asm/pgtable-bits.h has grown to become an unreadable mess of #ifdef
directives defining bits conditionally upon other bits all at the
preprocessing stage, for no good reason.

Instead of having quite so many #ifdef's, simply use enums to provide
sequential numbering for bit shifts, without having to keep track
manually of what the last bit defined was. Masks are defined separately,
after the shifts, which allows for most of their definitions to be
reused for all systems rather than duplicated.

This patch is not intended to make any behavioural change to the code -
all bits should be used in the same way they were before this patch.
