MIPS: KVM: Fix preemption warning reading FPU capability

Reading the KVM_CAP_MIPS_FPU capability returns cpu_has_fpu, however
this uses smp_processor_id() to read the current CPU capabilities (since
some old MIPS systems could have FPUs present on only a subset of CPUs).

We don't support any such systems, so work around the warning by using
raw_cpu_has_fpu instead.

We should probably instead claim not to support FPU at all if any one
CPU is lacking an FPU, but this should do for now.
