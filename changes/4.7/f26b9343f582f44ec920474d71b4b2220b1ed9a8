drm/exynos: add support for pipeline clock to the framework

Components belonging to the same pipeline often requires
synchronized clocks. Such clocks are sometimes provided
by external clock controller, but they can be also provided by
pipeline components. In latter case there should be a way
to access them from another component belonging to the same pipeline.
This is the case of:
- DECON,FIMD -> HDMI and HDMI-PHY clock,
- FIMD -> DP and DP clock in FIMD.
The latter case has been solved by clock_enable callback
in exynos_drm_crtc_ops. This solutin will not work with
HDMI path as in this case clock is provided by encoder.

This patch provides more generic solution allowing to register
pipeline clock during initialization in exynos_drm_crtc structure.
This way the clock will be easily accessible from both components.
