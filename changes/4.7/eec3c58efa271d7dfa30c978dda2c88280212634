ARC: clockevent: switch to cpu notifier for clockevent setup

ARC Timers so far have been handled as "legacy" w/o explicit description
in DT. This poses challenge for newer platforms wanting to use them.
This series will eventually help move timers over to DT.

This patch does a small change of using a CPU notifier to set clockevent
on non-boot CPUs. So explicit setup is done only on boot CPU (which will
later be done by DT)
