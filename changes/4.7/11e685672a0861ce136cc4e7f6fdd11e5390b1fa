mm: disable DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT on !NO_BOOTMEM

When we have !NO_BOOTMEM, the deferred page struct initialization
doesn't work well because the pages reserved in bootmem are released to
the page allocator uncoditionally.  It causes memory corruption and
system crash eventually.

As Mel suggested, the bootmem is retiring slowly.  We fix the issue by
simply hiding DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT when bootmem is enabled.
