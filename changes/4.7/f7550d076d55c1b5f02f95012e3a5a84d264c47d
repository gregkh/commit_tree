pvclock: Cleanup to remove function pvclock_get_nsec_offset

Function __pvclock_read_cycles is short enough, so there is no need to
have another function pvclock_get_nsec_offset to calculate tsc delta.
It's better to combine it into function __pvclock_read_cycles.

Remove useless variables in function __pvclock_read_cycles.
