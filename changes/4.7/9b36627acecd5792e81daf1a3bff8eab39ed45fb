net: remove dev->trans_start

previous patches removed all direct accesses to dev->trans_start,
so change the netif_trans_update helper to update trans_start of
netdev queue 0 instead and then remove trans_start from struct net_device.

AFAICS a lot of the netif_trans_update() invocations are now useless
because they occur in ndo_start_xmit and driver doesn't set LLTX
(i.e. stack already took care of the update).

As I can't test any of them it seems better to just leave them alone.
