Bluetooth: vhci: Fix race at creating hci device

hci_vhci driver creates a hci device object dynamically upon each
HCI_VENDOR_PKT write.  Although it checks the already created object
and returns an error, it's still racy and may build multiple hci_dev
objects concurrently when parallel writes are performed, as the device
tracks only a single hci_dev object.

This patch introduces a mutex to protect against the concurrent device
creations.
