i40evf: Drop packet split receive routine

As part of preparation for the rx-refactor, remove the
packet split receive routine and ancillary code.

Some of the split related context set up code stays in
i40e_virtchnl_pf.c in case an older VF driver tries to load
and still wants to use packet split.
