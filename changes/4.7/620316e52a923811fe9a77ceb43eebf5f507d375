rcutorture: Avoid RCU CPU stall warning and RT throttling

Running rcuperf can result in RCU CPU stall warnings and RT throttling.
These occur because on of the real-time writer processes does
ftrace_dump() while still running at real-time priority.  This commit
therefore prevents these problems by setting the writer thread back to
SCHED_NORMAL (AKA SCHED_OTHER) before doing ftrace_dump().

In addition, this commit adds a small fixed delay before dumping ftrace
buffer in order to decrease the probability that this dumping will
interfere with other writers' grace periods.
