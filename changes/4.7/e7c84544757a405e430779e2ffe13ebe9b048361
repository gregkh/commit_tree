drm/i915: Make modeset state verifier take crtc as argument.

This will make it easier to keep the crtc checker when atomic
commit is reworked for asynchronous commits. This prevents checking
crtc's that were not part of the state. It's safe to verify disabled
encoders, connectors and dpll's that are not part of the state,
because during modeset connection_mutex is held.
