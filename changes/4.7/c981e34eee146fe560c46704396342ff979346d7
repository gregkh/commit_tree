i2c: octeon: Use i2c recovery framework

Switch to the i2c bus recovery framework using generic SCL recovery.
If this fails try to reset the hardware. The recovery is triggered
during START on timeout of the interrupt or failure to reach
the START / repeated-START condition.

The START function is moved to xfer and while at it remove the
xfer debug message (i2c core already provides a debug message
for this).
