tipc: set 'active' state correctly for first established link

When we are displaying statistics for the first link established between
two peers, it will always be presented as STANDBY although it in reality
is ACTIVE.

This happens because we forget to set the 'active' flag in the link
instance at the moment it is established. Although this is a bug, it only
has impact on the presentation view of the link, not on its actual
functionality.
