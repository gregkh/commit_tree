net: vrf: protect changes to private data with rcu

One cpu can be processing packets which includes using the cached route
entries in the vrf device's private data and on another cpu the device
gets deleted which releases the routes and sets the pointers in net_vrf
to NULL. This results in datapath dereferencing a NULL pointer.

Fix by protecting access to dst's with rcu.
