ath10k: remove MSI range support

MSI-X is never well-tested, might contain bugs and generally isn't
really all that useful to maintain. Also ath10k is mainly used with
shared/singly-MSI interrupt systems. Hence removing MSI range support.
This change will be useful for further cleanup in copy engine lock
and to add NAPI support.
