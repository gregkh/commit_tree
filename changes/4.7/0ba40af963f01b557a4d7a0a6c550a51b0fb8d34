nfp: move link state interrupt request/free calls

We need to be able to disable the link state interrupt when
the device is brought down.  We used to just free the IRQ
at the beginning of .ndo_stop().  As we now move towards
more ordered .ndo_open()/.ndo_stop() paths LSC allocation
should be placed in the "allocate resource" section.

Since the IRQ can't be freed early in .ndo_stop(), it is
disabled instead.
