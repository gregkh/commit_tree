staging: rtl8188eu: Remove license paragraph with mailing address

This fixes the issue reported by checkpatch.pl:

	"Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software
	Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF
	has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again.  Linux
	already includes a copy of the GPL."

in all files for the rtl8188eu driver.
