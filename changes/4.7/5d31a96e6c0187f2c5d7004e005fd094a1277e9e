powerpc/livepatch: Add livepatch stack to struct thread_info

In order to support live patching we need to maintain an alternate
stack of TOC & LR values. We use the base of the stack for this, and
store the "live patch stack pointer" in struct thread_info.

Unlike the other fields of thread_info, we can not statically initialise
that value, so it must be done at run time.

This patch just adds the code to support that, it is not enabled until
the next patch which actually adds live patch support.
