rcu: Remove expedited GP funnel-lock bypass

Commit #cdacbe1f91264 ("rcu: Add fastpath bypassing funnel locking")
turns out to be a pessimization at high load because it forces a tree
full of tasks to wait for an expedited grace period that they probably
do not need.  This commit therefore removes this optimization.
