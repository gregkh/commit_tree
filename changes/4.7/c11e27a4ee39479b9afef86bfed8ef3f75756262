staging: lustre: libcfs: bug fixes for cfs_crypto_hash_final()

Change cfs_crypto_hash_final() to always clean up the hash descrptor
instead of not doing this in error cases.  All of the callers were
just calling cfs_crypto_hash_final() immediately to clean up the
descriptor anyway, and the old behaviour is unlike other init/fini
functions, and prone to memory leaks and other incorrect usage.  The
callers can call cfs_crypto_digest_size() to determine the hash size
in advance if needed, and avoid complexity in cfs_crypto_hash_final().
