mm/memcontrol.c: fix the margin computation in mem_cgroup_margin()

mem_cgroup_margin() might return (memory.limit - memory_count) when the
memsw.limit is in excess.  This doesn't happen usually because we do not
allow excess on hard limits and (memory.limit <= memsw.limit), but
__GFP_NOFAIL charges can force the charge and cause the excess when no
memory is really swappable (swap is full or no anonymous memory is
left).
