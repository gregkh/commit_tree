security: integrity: Remove select to deleted option PUBLIC_KEY_ALGO_RSA

Commit d43de6c780a8 ("akcipher: Move the RSA DER encoding check to
the crypto layer") removed the Kconfig option PUBLIC_KEY_ALGO_RSA,
but forgot to remove a 'select' to this option in the definition of
INTEGRITY_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS.

Let's remove the select, as it's ineffective now.
