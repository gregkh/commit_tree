mmc: sdhci-acpi: Ensure connected devices are powered when probing

Some devices connected to the SDHCI controller may have separate enabling
lines that are controlled through GPIO. These devices need to be powered
on and enabled before probing. This is to ensure all devices connected can
be seen by the controller.

Note, for "stable" this patch depends on the following change:
commit 78a898d0e395 ("ACPI / PM: Export acpi_device_fix_up_power()")
