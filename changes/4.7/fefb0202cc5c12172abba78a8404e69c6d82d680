qede: Add VF support

Adding a PCI callback for `sriov_configure' and a new PCI device id for
the VF [+ Some minor changes to accomodate differences between PF and VF
at the qede].
Following this, VF creation should be possible and the entire subset of
existing PF functionality that's allow to VFs should be supported.
