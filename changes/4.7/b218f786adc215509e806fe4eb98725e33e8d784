IB/hfi1: Use global defines for upper bits in opcode

The awkward coding for setting the allowed_ops field
was tripping an smatch warning.

This patch uses the more appropriate defines from include/rdma
to avoid the issue.

As part of the patch remove a mask that was duplicated
in rdmavt include files and use that mask as appropriate.
