gianfar: fix the last transmit buffer descriptor

When the transmit hardware timestamping is enabled, an additional
TxBD would be added and would be set as the last TxBD with TXBD_LAST
and TXBD_INTERRUPT. However this has been broken by a patch recently.
This made the software couldn't get transmit hardware timestamps and
resulted in call trace. So, this patch is to fix this issue.
