drm/i915: Revert DisplayPort fast link training feature

It has been found out that in some HW combination the DisplayPort
fast link training feature caused screen flickering. Let's revert
this feature for now until we can ensure that the feature works for
all platforms.

This is a manual revert of commits 5fa836a9d859 ("drm/i915: DP link
training optimization") and 4e96c97742f4 ("drm/i915: eDP link training
optimization").

Fixes: 5fa836a9d859 ("drm/i915: DP link training optimization")
Fixes: 4e96c97742f4 ("drm/i915: eDP link training optimization")
