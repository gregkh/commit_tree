[media] sta2x11_vip: fix s_std

The s_std ioctl was broken in this driver, partially due to the
changes to the adv7180 driver (this affected the handling of
V4L2_STD_ALL) and partially because the new standard was never
stored in vip->std.

The handling of V4L2_STD_ALL has been rewritten to just call querystd
and the new standard is now stored correctly.
