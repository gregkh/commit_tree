hv_netvsc: set nvdev link after populating chn_table

Crash in netvsc_send() is observed when netvsc device is re-created on
mtu change/set channels. The crash is caused by dereferencing of NULL
channel pointer which comes from chn_table. The root cause is a mixture
of two facts:
- we set nvdev pointer in net_device_context in alloc_net_device()
  before we populate chn_table.
- we populate chn_table[0] only.

The issue could be papered over by checking channel != NULL in
netvsc_send() but populating the whole chn_table and writing the
nvdev pointer afterwards seems more appropriate.
