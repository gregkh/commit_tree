staging/lustre/clio: optimize read ahead code

It used to check each page in the readahead window is covered by
a lock underneath, now cpo_page_is_under_lock() provides @max_index
to help decide the maximum ra window. @max_index can be modified by
OSC to extend the maximum lock region, to align stripe boundary at
LOV, and to make sure the readahead region at least covers read
region at LLITE layer.

After this is done, usually readahead code calls
cpo_page_is_under_lock() for each stripe.
