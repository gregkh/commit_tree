net: l3mdev: Add hook in ip and ipv6

Currently the VRF driver uses the rx_handler to switch the skb device
to the VRF device. Switching the dev prior to the ip / ipv6 layer
means the VRF driver has to duplicate IP/IPv6 processing which adds
overhead and makes features such as retaining the ingress device index
more complicated than necessary.

This patch moves the hook to the L3 layer just after the first NF_HOOK
for PRE_ROUTING. This location makes exposing the original ingress device
trivial (next patch) and allows adding other NF_HOOKs to the VRF driver
in the future.

dev_queue_xmit_nit is exported so that the VRF driver can cycle the skb
with the switched device through the packet taps to maintain current
behavior (tcpdump can be used on either the vrf device or the enslaved
devices).
