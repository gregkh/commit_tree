udp: prevent skbs lingering in tunnel socket queues

In case we find a socket with encapsulation enabled we should call
the encap_recv function even if just a udp header without payload is
available. The callbacks are responsible for correctly verifying and
dropping the packets.

Also, in case the header validation fails for geneve and vxlan we
shouldn't put the skb back into the socket queue, no one will pick
them up there.  Instead we can simply discard them in the respective
encap_recv functions.
