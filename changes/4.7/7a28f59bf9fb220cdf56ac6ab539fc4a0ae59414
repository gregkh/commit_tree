libceph: allocate ceph_osd with GFP_NOFAIL

create_osd() is called way too deep in the stack to be able to error
out in a sane way; a failing create_osd() just messes everything up.
The current req_notarget list solution is broken - the list is never
traversed as it's not entirely clear when to do it, I guess.

If we were to start traversing it at regular intervals and retrying
each request, we wouldn't be far off from what __GFP_NOFAIL is doing,
so allocate OSD sessions with __GFP_NOFAIL, at least until we come up
with a better fix.
