rtc: tps6586x: rename so module can be autoloaded

This module is loaded by the related mfd driver which has
the needed MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c,...).

This patch fix the modalias when the rtc driver is built
as a module, so the right name is used.
Everything operates correctly when this module is builtin.
