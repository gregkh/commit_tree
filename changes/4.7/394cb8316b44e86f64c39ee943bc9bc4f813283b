cpufreq: qoriq: Fix cooling device registration issue during suspend

Cooling device is registered by ready callback. It's also invoked while
system resuming from sleep (Enabling non-boot cpus). Thus cooling device
may be multiple registered. Matchable unregistration is added to exit
callback to fix this issue.
