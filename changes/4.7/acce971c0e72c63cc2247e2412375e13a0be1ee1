powerpc/powernv/ioda1: Introduce PNV_IODA1_DMA32_SEGSIZE

Currently, there is one macro (TCE32_TABLE_SIZE) representing the
TCE table size for one DMA32 segment. The constant representing
the DMA32 segment size (1 << 28) is still used in the code.

This defines PNV_IODA1_DMA32_SEGSIZE representing one DMA32
segment size. the TCE table size can be calcualted when the page
has fixed 4KB size. So all the related calculation depends on one
macro (PNV_IODA1_DMA32_SEGSIZE). No logical changes introduced.
