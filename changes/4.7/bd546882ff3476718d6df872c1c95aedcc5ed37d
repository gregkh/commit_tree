[media] soc_camera: rcar_vin: add R-Car Gen 2 and 3 fallback compatibility strings

Add fallback compatibility string for R-Car Gen 1 and 2.

In the case of Renesas R-Car hardware we know that there are generations of
SoCs, e.g. Gen 2 and 3. But beyond that it's unclear what the relationship
between IP blocks might be. For example, I believe that r8a7790 is older
than r8a7791 but that doesn't imply that the latter is a descendant of the
former or vice versa.

We can, however, by examining the documentation and behaviour of the
hardware at run-time observe that the current driver implementation appears
to be compatible with the IP blocks on SoCs within a given generation.

For the above reasons and convenience when enabling new SoCs a
per-generation fallback compatibility string scheme being adopted for
drivers for Renesas SoCs.
