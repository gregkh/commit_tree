arm64: smp: Add function to determine if cpus are stuck in the kernel

kernel/smp.c has a fancy counter that keeps track of the number of CPUs
it marked as not-present and left in cpu_park_loop(). If there are any
CPUs spinning in here, features like kexec or hibernate may release them
by overwriting this memory.

This problem also occurs on machines using spin-tables to release
secondary cores.
After commit 44dbcc93ab67 ("arm64: Fix behavior of maxcpus=N")
we bring all known cpus into the secondary holding pen, meaning this
memory can't be re-used by kexec or hibernate.

Add a function cpus_are_stuck_in_kernel() to determine if either of these
cases have occurred.
