ARM: dts: rockchip: add the thermal main info found on rk3228

This patch adds the thermal needed main information for rk3228 SoCS.

Basically has the following content:

1) TSADC controller:
Add the needed attributes for rk3036 TSADC controller.

Especially for the TSHUT, in some cases if we are unable to shut it down
in orderly fashion (says: kernel is stuck holding a lock or similar), then
hardware TSHUT will reset it.
If the temperature is over 95C over a period of time the thermal shutdown
of the tsadc is invoked with can either reset the entire chip via the CRU,
or notify the PMIC via a GPIO. This should be set in the specific board.

2) Thermal zones:
Add the needed device mode for thermal generic framework.
Detail in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt.
