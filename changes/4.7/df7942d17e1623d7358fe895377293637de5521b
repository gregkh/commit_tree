KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Always resample level interrupts

When reading back from the list registers, we need to perform
two actions for level interrupts:
1) clear the soft-pending bit if the interrupt is not pending
   anymore *in the list register*
2) resample the line level and propagate it to the pending state

But these two actions shouldn't be linked, and we should *always*
resample the line level, no matter what state is in the list
register. Otherwise, we may end-up injecting spurious interrupts
that have been already retired.
