drm/vc4: Fix drm_vblank_put/get imbalance in page flip path.

The async page flip path was missing drm_crtc_vblank_get/put
completely. The sync flip path was missing a vblank put, so async
flips only reported proper pageflip completion events by chance,
and vblank irq's never turned off after a first vsync'ed page flip
until system reboot.

Tested against Raspian kernel 4.4.8 tree on RPi 2B.
