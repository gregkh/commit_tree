xfs: add configuration handlers for specific errors

now most of the infrastructure is in place, we can start adding
support for configuring specific errors such as ENODEV, ENOSPC, EIO,
etc. Add these error configurations and configure them all to have
appropriate behaviours. That is, all will be configured to retry
forever by default, except for ENODEV, which is an unrecoverable
error, so it will be configured to not retry on error
