ASoC: Intel: Skylake: add link management

Use shiny new link APIs to manage the links. Also remove old link
configuration logic from driver.

We need to keep link and cmd dma to off during active suspend
to allow system to enter low power state and turn it on if
the link and cmd dma was on before active suspend in active
resume.
