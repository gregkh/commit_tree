reset: Make [of_]reset_control_get[_foo] functions wrappers

With both the regular, _by_index and _optional variants we already have
quite a few variants of [of_]reset_control_get[_foo], the upcoming
addition of shared reset lines support makes this worse.

This commit changes all the variants into wrappers around common core
functions. For completeness sake this commit also adds a new
devm_get_reset_control_by_index wrapper.
