lightnvm: add is_cached entry to struct ppa_addr

A target requires a method to identify PPAs that are either cached in
memory or on disk. This can efficiently be maintained within the PPA.
The target host-side translation table can then lookup a PPA and know
from the PPA if it is cached or on disk. In the case it is cached, it is
the responsibility of the target to maintain this cache.
