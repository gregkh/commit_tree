EDAC, ie31200_edac: Add Skylake support

Skylake adjusts some register locations, but otherwise follows the
existing model quite closely. I was able to verify that the 'ce_count'
increments when 'bad dimms' are used. The accounting of 'ce_count' and
'ue_count' is the primary functionality of interest for us. Tested on
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1260L v5 @ 2.90GHz.
