powerpc/mm/radix: Add radix callback for pmd accessors

This only does 64K Linux page support for now. 64K hash Linux config
THP needs to differentiate it from hugetlb huge page because with THP we
need to track hash pte slot information with respect to each subpage.
This is not needed with hugetlb hugepage, because we don't do MPSS with
hugetlb.

Radix doesn't have any such restrictions.
