mm, elf: handle vm_brk error

load_elf_library doesn't handle vm_brk failure although nothing really
indicates it cannot do that because the function is allowed to fail due
to vm_mmap failures already.  This might be not a problem now but later
patch will make vm_brk killable (resp.  mmap_sem for write waiting will
become killable) and so the failure will be more probable.
