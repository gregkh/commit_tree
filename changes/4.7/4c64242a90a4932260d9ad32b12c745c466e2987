ipv6: Fix nexthdr for reinjection

In ip6_input_finish the nexthdr protocol is retrieved from the
next header offset that is returned in the cb of the skb.
This method does not work for UDP encapsulation that may not
even have a concept of a nexthdr field (e.g. FOU).

This patch checks for a final protocol (INET6_PROTO_FINAL) when a
protocol handler returns > 0. If the protocol is not final then
resubmission is performed on nhoff value. If the protocol is final
then the nexthdr is taken to be the return value.
