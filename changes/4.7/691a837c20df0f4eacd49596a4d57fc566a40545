fnic: Fix to cleanup aborted IO to avoid device being offlined by mid-layer

If an I/O times out and an abort issued by host, if the abort is
successful we need to set scsi status as DID_ABORT. Or else the
mid-layer error handler which looks for this error code, will offline
the device. Also if the original I/O is not found in fnic firmware, we
will consider the abort as successful.  The start_time assignment is
moved because of the new goto.  Fnic driver version changed from
1.6.0.17a to 1.6.0.19, version 1.6.0.18 has been skipped
