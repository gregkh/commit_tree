fs/namei.c: Add hashlen_string() function

We'd like to make more use of the highly-optimized dcache hash functions
throughout the kernel, rather than have every subsystem create its own,
and a function that hashes basic null-terminated strings is required
for that.

(The name is to emphasize that it returns both hash and length.)

It's actually useful in the dcache itself, specifically d_alloc_name().
Other uses in the next patch.

full_name_hash() is also tweaked to make it more generally useful:
1) Take a "char *" rather than "unsigned char *" argument, to
   be consistent with hash_name().
2) Handle zero-length inputs.  If we want more callers, we don't want
   to make them worry about corner cases.
