libceph: switch to calc_target(), part 2

The crux of this is getting rid of ceph_osdc_build_request(), so that
MOSDOp can be encoded not before but after calc_target() calculates the
actual target.  Encoding now happens within ceph_osdc_start_request().

Also nuked is the accompanying bunch of pointers into the encoded
buffer that was used to update fields on each send - instead, the
entire front is re-encoded.  If we want to support target->name_len !=
base->name_len in the future, there is no other way, because oid is
surrounded by other fields in the encoded buffer.

Encoding OSD ops and adding data items to the request message were
mixed together in osd_req_encode_op().  While we want to re-encode OSD
ops, we don't want to add duplicate data items to the message when
resending, so all call to ceph_osdc_msg_data_add() are factored out
into a new setup_request_data().
