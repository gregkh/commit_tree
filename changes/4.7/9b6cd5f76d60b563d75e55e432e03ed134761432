ext2: Fix block zeroing in ext2_get_blocks() for DAX

When zeroing allocated blocks for DAX, we accidentally zeroed only the
first allocated block instead of all of them. So far this problem is
hidden by the fact that page faults always need only a single block and
DAX write code zeroes blocks again. But the zeroing in DAX code is racy
and needs to be removed so fix the zeroing in ext2 to zero all allocated
blocks.
