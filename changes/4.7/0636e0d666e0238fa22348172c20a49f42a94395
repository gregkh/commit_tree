drm/amd/powerplay: fix issue uvd dpm can't enabled on Polaris11.

1. Populate correct value of VDDCI voltage for SMC SAMU, VCE,
   and UVD levels depending on whether VDDCi control is SVI2 or GPIO.
2. Populate SMC ACPI minimum voltage using VBIOS boot SCLK and MCLK

When static voltage is configured as VDDCI, driver still tries to program
a voltage for MM minVoltage using VDDC-VDDCI delta requirement.
minVoltage should be set as boot up voltage.
