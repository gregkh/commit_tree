btrfs: create a helper function to read the disk super

A part of code from btrfs_scan_one_device() is moved to a new function
btrfs_read_disk_super(), so that former function looks cleaner. (In this
process it also moves the code which ensures null terminating label). So
this creates easy opportunity to merge various duplicate codes on read
disk super. Earlier attempt to merge duplicate codes highlighted that
there were some issues for which there are duplicate codes (to read disk
super), however it was not clear what was the issue. So until we figure
that out, its better to keep them in a separate functions.
