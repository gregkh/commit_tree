powerpc/powernv: Simplify pnv_ioda_setup_pe_seg()

pnv_ioda_setup_pe_seg() associates the IO and M32 segments with the
owner PE. The code mapping segments should be fixed and immune from
logic changes introduced to pnv_ioda_setup_pe_seg().

This moves the code mapping segments to helper pnv_ioda_setup_pe_res().
The data type for @rc is changed to "int64_t". Also, argument @hose is
removed from pnv_ioda_setup_pe() as it can be got from @pe. No functional
changes introduced.
