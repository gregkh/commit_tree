ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Change name of probe function

The codec's probe function is named aic32x4_probe.  This is going to
conflict with later work to implement SPI support and separate out I2S
into its own file.  In line with other drivers in the tree, this function
is renamed to aic32x4_codec_probe instead.
