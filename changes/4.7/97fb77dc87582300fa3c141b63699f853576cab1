drivers:hv: Make a function to free mmio regions through vmbus

This patch introduces a function that reverses everything
done by vmbus_allocate_mmio().  Existing code just called
release_mem_region().  Future patches in this series
require a more complex sequence of actions, so this function
is introduced to wrap those actions.
