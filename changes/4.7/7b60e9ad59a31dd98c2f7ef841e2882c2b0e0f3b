radix-tree: fix multiorder BUG_ON in radix_tree_insert

These BUG_ON tests are to ensure that all the tags are clear when
inserting a new entry.  If we insert a multiorder entry, we'll end up
looking at the tags for a different node, and so the BUG_ON can end up
triggering spuriously.

Also, we now have three tags, not two, so check all three are clear, and
check all the root tags with a single call to BUG_ON since the bits are
stored contiguously.

Include a test-case to ensure this problem does not reoccur.
