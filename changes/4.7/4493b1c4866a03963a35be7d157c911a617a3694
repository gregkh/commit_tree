KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add MMIO handling framework

Add an MMIO handling framework to the VGIC emulation:
Each register is described by its offset, size (or number of bits per
IRQ, if applicable) and the read/write handler functions. We provide
initialization macros to describe each GIC register later easily.

Separate dispatch functions for read and write accesses are connected
to the kvm_io_bus framework and binary-search for the responsible
register handler based on the offset address within the region.
We convert the incoming data (referenced by a pointer) to the host's
endianess and use pass-by-value to hand the data over to the actual
handler functions.

The register handler prototype and the endianess conversion are
courtesy of Christoffer Dall.
