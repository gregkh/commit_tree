MIPS: Fix watchpoint restoration

Commit f51246efee2b ("MIPS: Get rid of finish_arch_switch().") moved the
__restore_watch() call from finish_arch_switch() (i.e. after resume()
returns) to before the resume() call in switch_to(). This results in
watchpoints only being restored when a task is descheduled, preventing
the watchpoints from being effective most of the time, except due to
chance before the watchpoints are lazily removed.

Fix the call sequence from switch_to() through to
mips_install_watch_registers() to pass the task_struct pointer of the
next task, instead of using current. This allows the watchpoints for the
next (non-current) task to be restored without reintroducing
finish_arch_switch().
