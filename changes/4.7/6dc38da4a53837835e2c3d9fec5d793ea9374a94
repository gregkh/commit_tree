usbip: safe completion against unbind operation

This patch adds a code fragment to ignore completing URBs in closing
connection.

Regarding this patch, 2 execution contexts are related.

1) stub_tx.c: stub_complete() which is called from USB core
1-1) add to unlink list and free URB or
1-2) move to tx list

2) stub_dev.c: stub_shutdown_connection() which is invoked by unbind
operation through sysfs.
2-1) stop TX/RX threads
2-2) close TCP connection and set ud.tcp_socket to NULL
2-3) cleanup pending URBs by stub_device_cleanup_urbs(sdev)
2-4) free unlink list (no lock)

In the race condition, URBs which will be cleared in 2-3) may be
handled in 1).
In case 1-1), it will not be transferred bcause tx threads are stooped
in 2-1).
In case 1-2), may be freed in 2-4).

With this patch, after 2-2), completing URBs in 1) will not be handled
and cleared in 2-3).
