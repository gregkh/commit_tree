ASoC: topology: ABI - Define types for vendor tuples

Tuples, a pair of token and value, can be used to define vendor specific
data, for controls and widgets. This can avoid importing binary data blob
from other files.

Vendor specific tuple arrays will be embeded in the private data buffer
of a control or widget object. To be backward compatible, union is used
to define the tuple arrays in the existing private data ABI object
'struct snd_soc_tplg_private'.

Vendors need to make sure the token values defined by the topology conf
file match those defined by their driver.

Now supported tuple types are uuid, string, bool, byte, short and word.
