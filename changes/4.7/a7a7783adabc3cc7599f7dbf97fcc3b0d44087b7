fm10k: correctly handle LPORT_MAP error

Currently, any error responses from the switch manager after an
LPORT_MAP request are silently ignored. At most the mailbox message will
be reported as an error. This can result in unexpected behavior when the
switch manager has configured a port with zero bandwidth. Add support
for reading the fm10k_swapi_error structure from LPORT_MAP responses.

If the message contains the necessary TLV and has a non-zero error code,
report link down, clear the dglort_map, and delay the next
get_host_state call by a reasonable delay. Also log an error message
indicating that the LPORT_MAP request failed.

The delay ensures preventing an interrupt storm on the switch manager,
and reduces the number of mailbox messages we send in this scenario
drastically.
