dax: Fix condition for filling of PMD holes

Currently dax_pmd_fault() decides to fill a PMD-sized hole only if
returned buffer has BH_Uptodate set. However that doesn't get set for
any mapping buffer so that branch is actually a dead code. The
BH_Uptodate check doesn't make any sense so just remove it.
