perf/core: Disable the event on a truncated AUX record

When the PMU driver reports a truncated AUX record, it effectively means
that there is no more usable room in the event's AUX buffer (even though
there may still be some room, so that perf_aux_output_begin() doesn't take
action). At this point the consumer still has to be woken up and the event
has to be disabled, otherwise the event will just keep spinning between
perf_aux_output_begin() and perf_aux_output_end() until its context gets
unscheduled.

Again, for cpu-wide events this means never, so once in this condition,
they will be forever losing data.

Fix this by disabling the event and waking up the consumer in case of a
truncated AUX record.
