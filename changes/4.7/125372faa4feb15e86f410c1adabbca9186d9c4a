gre: receive also TEB packets for lwtunnels

For ipgre interfaces in collect metadata mode, receive also traffic with
encapsulated Ethernet headers. The lwtunnel users are supposed to sort this
out correctly. This allows to have mixed Ethernet + L3-only traffic on the
same lwtunnel interface. This is the same way as VXLAN-GPE behaves.

To keep backwards compatibility and prevent any surprises, gretap interfaces
have priority in receiving packets with Ethernet headers.
