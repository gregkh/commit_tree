tracing: Add lock-free tracing_map

Add tracing_map, a special-purpose lock-free map for tracing.

tracing_map is designed to aggregate or 'sum' one or more values
associated with a specific object of type tracing_map_elt, which
is associated by the map to a given key.

It provides various hooks allowing per-tracer customization and is
separated out into a separate file in order to allow it to be shared
between multiple tracers, but isn't meant to be generally used outside
of that context.

The tracing_map implementation was inspired by lock-free map
algorithms originated by Dr. Cliff Click:
