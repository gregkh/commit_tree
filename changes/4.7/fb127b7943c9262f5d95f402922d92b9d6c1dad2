drm/fsl-dcu: add TCON driver

Add driver for the TCON (timing controller) module. The TCON module
is a separate module attached after the DCU (display controller
unit). Each DCU instance has its own, directly connected TCON
instance. The DCU's RGB and timing signals are passing through
the TCON module. TCON can provide timing signals for raw TFT panels
or operate in a bypass mode which leaves all signals unaltered.

The driver currently only supports the bypass mode.
