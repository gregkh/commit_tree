drm/amdkfd: unbind only existing processes

When unbinding a process from a device (initiated by amd_iommu_v2), the
driver needs to make sure that process still exists in the process table.
There is a possibility that amdkfd's own notifier handler -
kfd_process_notifier_release() - was called before the unbind function
and it already removed the process from the process table.

v2:
Because there can be only one process with the specified pasid, and
because *p can't be NULL inside the hash_for_each_rcu macro, it is more
reasonable to just put the whole code inside the if statement that
compares the pasid value. That way, when we exit hash_for_each_rcu, we
simply exit the function as well.
