stm class: Fix integer boundary checks for master range

Master IDs are of unsigned int type, yet in the configfs policy code
we're validating user's input against INT_MAX. This is both pointless
and misleading as the real limits are imposed by the stm device's
[sw_start..sw_end] (which are also limited by the spec to be no larger
than 2^16-1).

Clean this up by getting rid of the redundant comparisons.
