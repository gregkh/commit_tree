mtd: brcmnand: respect ECC algorithm set by NAND subsystem

This is more obvious than guessing based on ECC strength. It allows
using NAND on devices with BCH-1 (e.g. D-Link DIR-885L).

This maintains DT backward compatibility by defaulting to Hamming if a
1-bit ECC algorithm is specified without a corresponding algorithm
selection. i.e., to use BCH-1, you must specify:

  nand-ecc-strength = <1>;
  nand-ecc-step-size = <512>;
  nand-ecc-algo = "bch";

Also adds a check to ensure we haven't allowed someone to get by with SW
ECC. If we want to support SW ECC, we need to refactor some other pieces
of this driver.
