arm64: Cleanup SCTLR flags

We currently have macros defining flags for the arm64 sctlr registers in
both kvm_arm.h and sysreg.h.  To clean things up and simplify move the
definitions of the SCTLR_EL2 flags from kvm_arm.h to sysreg.h, rename any
SCTLR_EL1 or SCTLR_EL2 flags that are common to both registers to be
SCTLR_ELx, with 'x' indicating a common flag, and fixup all files to
include the proper header or to use the new macro names.
