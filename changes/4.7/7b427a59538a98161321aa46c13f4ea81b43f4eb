xen-blkfront: save uncompleted reqs in blkfront_resume()

Uncompleted reqs used to be 'saved and resubmitted' in blkfront_recover() during
migration, but that's too late after multi-queue was introduced.

After a migrate to another host (which may not have multiqueue support), the
number of rings (block hardware queues) may be changed and the ring and shadow
structure will also be reallocated.

The blkfront_recover() then can't 'save and resubmit' the real
uncompleted reqs because shadow structure have been reallocated.

This patch fixes this issue by moving the 'save' logic out of
blkfront_recover() to earlier place in blkfront_resume().

The 'resubmit' is not changed and still in blkfront_recover().
