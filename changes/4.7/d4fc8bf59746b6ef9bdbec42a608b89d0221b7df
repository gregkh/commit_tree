xhci: fix typo in babble endpoint handling comment

The 0.95 xHCI spec says that non-control endpoints will be halted if a
babble is detected on a transfer.  The 0.96 xHCI spec says all types of
endpoints will be halted when a babble is detected.  Some hardware that
claims to be 0.95 compliant halts the control endpoint anyway.
