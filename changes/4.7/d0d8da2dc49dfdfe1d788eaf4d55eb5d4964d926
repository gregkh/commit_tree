zsmalloc: require GFP in zs_malloc()

Pass GFP flags to zs_malloc() instead of using a fixed mask supplied to
zs_create_pool(), so we can be more flexible, but, more importantly, we
need this to switch zram to per-cpu compression streams -- zram will try
to allocate handle with preemption disabled in a fast path and switch to
a slow path (using different gfp mask) if the fast one has failed.

Apart from that, this also align zs_malloc() interface with zspool/zbud.
