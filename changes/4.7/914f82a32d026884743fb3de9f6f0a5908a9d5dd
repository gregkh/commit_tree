ext4: refactor direct IO code

Currently ext4 direct IO handling is split between ext4_ext_direct_IO()
and ext4_ind_direct_IO(). However the extent based function calls into
the indirect based one for some cases and for example it is not able to
handle file extending. Previously it was not also properly handling
retries in case of ENOSPC errors. With DAX things would get even more
contrieved so just refactor the direct IO code and instead of indirect /
extent split do the split to read vs writes.
