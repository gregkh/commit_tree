batman-adv: Fix use-after-free/double-free of tt_req_node

The tt_req_node is added and removed from a list inside a spinlock. But the
locking is sometimes removed even when the object is still referenced and
will be used later via this reference. For example batadv_send_tt_request
can create a new tt_req_node (including add to a list) and later
re-acquires the lock to remove it from the list and to free it. But at this
time another context could have already removed this tt_req_node from the
list and freed it.

This can only be solved via reference counting to allow multiple contexts
to handle the list manipulation while making sure that only the last
context holding a reference will free the object.
