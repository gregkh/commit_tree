libceph: switch to calc_target(), part 1

Replace __calc_request_pg() and most of __map_request() with
calc_target() and start using req->r_t.

ceph_osdc_build_request() however still encodes base_oid, because it's
called before calc_target() is and target_oid is empty at that point in
time; a printf in osdc_show() also shows base_oid.  This is fixed in
"libceph: switch to calc_target(), part 2".
