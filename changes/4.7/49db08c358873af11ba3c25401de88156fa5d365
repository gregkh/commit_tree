chrdev: emit a warning when we go below dynamic major range

Currently a dynamically allocated character device major is taken
from 254 and downward. This mechanism is used for RTC, IIO and a
few other subsystems.

The kernel currently has no check prevening these dynamic
allocations from eating into the assigned numbers at 233 and
downward.

In a recent test it was reported that so many dynamic device
majors were used on a test server, that the major number for
infiniband (231) was stolen. This occurred when allocating a new
major number for GPIO chips. The error messages from the kernel
were not helpful. (See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/2/14/124)

This patch adds a defined lower limit of the dynamic major
allocation region will henceforth emit a warning if we start to
eat into the assigned numbers. It does not do any semantic
changes and will not change the kernels behaviour: numbers will
still continue to be stolen, but we will know from dmesg what
is going on.

This also updates the Documentation/devices.txt to clearly
reflect that we are using this range of major numbers for dynamic
allocation.
