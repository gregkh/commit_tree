tty/serial: atmel: fix hardware handshake selection

Commit 1cf6e8fc8341 ("tty/serial: at91: fix RTS line management when
hardware handshake is enabled") actually allowed to enable hardware
handshaking.
Before, the CRTSCTS flags was silently ignored.

As the DMA controller can't drive RTS (as explain in the commit message).
Ensure that hardware flow control stays disabled when DMA is used and FIFOs
are not available.
