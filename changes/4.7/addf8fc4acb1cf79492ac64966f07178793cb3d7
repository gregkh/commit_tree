tuntap: correctly wake up process during uninit

We used to check dev->reg_state against NETREG_REGISTERED after each
time we are woke up. But after commit 9e641bdcfa4e ("net-tun:
restructure tun_do_read for better sleep/wakeup efficiency"), it uses
skb_recv_datagram() which does not check dev->reg_state. This will
result if we delete a tun/tap device after a process is blocked in the
reading. The device will wait for the reference count which was held
by that process for ever.

Fixes this by using RCV_SHUTDOWN which will be checked during
sk_recv_datagram() before trying to wake up the process during uninit.

sleep/wakeup efficiency")
