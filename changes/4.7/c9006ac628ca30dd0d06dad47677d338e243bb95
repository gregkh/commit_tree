ARM: dts: r8a7794: Don't disable referenced optional clocks

clk_get() on a disabled clock node will return -EPROBE_DEFER, which can
cause drivers to be deferred forever if such clocks are referenced in
their devices' clocks properties.

Update the various disabled external clock nodes to default to a
frequency of 0, but don't disable them, to prevent this.
