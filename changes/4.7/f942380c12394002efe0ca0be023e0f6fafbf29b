net/mlx5: E-Switch, Vport ingress/egress ACLs rules for spoofchk

Configure ingress and egress vport ACL rules according to spoofchk
admin parameters.

Ingress ACL flow table rules:
if (!spoofchk && !vst) allow all traffic.
else :
1) one of the following rules :
* if (spoofchk && vst) allow only untagged traffic with smac=original
mac sent from the VF.
* if (spoofchk && !vst) allow only traffic with smac=original mac sent
from the VF.
* if (!spoofchk && vst) allow only untagged traffic.
2) drop all traffic that didn't hit #1.

Add support for set vf spoofchk ndo.

Add non zero mac validation in case of spoofchk to set mac ndo:
when setting new mac we need to validate that the new mac is
not zero while the spoofchk is on because it is illegal
combination.
