cpufreq: intel_pstate: Adjust policy->max

When policy->max is changed via _PPC or sysfs and is more than the max non
turbo frequency, it does not really change resulting performance in some
processors. When policy->max results in a P-State ratio more than the
turbo activation ratio, then processor can choose any P-State up to max
turbo. So the user or _PPC setting has no value, but this can cause
undesirable side effects like:
- Showing reduced max percentage in Intel P-State sysfs
- It can cause reduced max performance under certain boundary conditions:
The requested max scaling frequency either via _PPC or via cpufreq-sysfs,
will be converted into a fixed floating point max percent scale. In
majority of the cases this will result in correct max. But not 100% of the
time. If the _PPC is requested at a point where the calculation lead to a
lower max, this can result in a lower P-State then expected and it will
impact performance.
Example of this condition using a Broadwell laptop with config TDP.

ACPI _PSS table from a Broadwell laptop
2301000 2300000 2200000 2000000 1900000 1800000 1700000 1500000 1400000
1300000 1100000 1000000 900000 800000 600000 500000

The actual results by disabling config TDP so that we can get what is
requested on or below 2300000Khz.

Now set the config TDP level 1 ratio as 0x0b (equivalent to 1100000KHz)
in BIOS (not every system will let you adjust this).
The turbo activation ratio will be set to one less than that, which will
be 0x0a (So any request above 1000000KHz should result in turbo region
assuming no thermal limits).
Here _PPC will request max to 1100000KHz (which basically should still
result in turbo as this is more than the turbo activation ratio up to
max allowable turbo frequency), but actual calculation resulted in a max
ceiling P-State which is 0x0a. So under any load condition, this driver
will not request turbo P-States. This will be a huge performance hit.

When config TDP feature is ON, if the _PPC points to a frequency above
turbo activation ratio, the performance can still reach max turbo. In this
case we don't need to treat this as the reduced frequency in set_policy
callback.

In this change when config TDP is active (by checking if the physical max
non turbo ratio is more than the current max non turbo ratio), any request
above current max non turbo is treated as full performance.
