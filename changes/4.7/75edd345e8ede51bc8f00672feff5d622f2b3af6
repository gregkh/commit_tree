tmpfs: preliminary minor tidyups

Make a few cleanups in mm/shmem.c, before going on to complicate it.

shmem_alloc_page() will become more complicated: we can't afford to to
have that complication duplicated between a CONFIG_NUMA version and a
!CONFIG_NUMA version, so rearrange the #ifdef'ery there to yield a
single shmem_swapin() and a single shmem_alloc_page().

Yes, it's a shame to inflict the horrid pseudo-vma on non-NUMA
configurations, but eliminating it is a larger cleanup: I have an
alloc_pages_mpol() patchset not yet ready - mpol handling is subtle and
bug-prone, and changed yet again since my last version.

Move __SetPageLocked, __SetPageSwapBacked from shmem_getpage_gfp() to
shmem_alloc_page(): that SwapBacked flag will be useful in future, to
help to distinguish different cases appropriately.

And the SGP_DIRTY variant of SGP_CACHE is hard to understand and of
little use (IIRC it dates back to when shmem_getpage() returned the page
unlocked): kill it and do the necessary in shmem_file_read_iter().

But an arm64 build then complained that info may be uninitialized (where
shmem_getpage_gfp() deletes a freshly alloced page beyond eof), and
advancing to an "sgp <= SGP_CACHE" test jogged it back to reality.
