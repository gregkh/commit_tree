PM / Runtime: Move ignore_children flag under CONFIG_PM

The ignore_children flag is used only when CONFIG_PM is set, so let's move
it into that section within the struct dev_pm_info.

Move also the corresponding pm_suspend_ignore_children() API out of
device.h into pm_runtime.h, to be consistent with similar APIs.

Unfortunate this causes the Toshiba PCI SD mmc host driver to fail to
compile as it needs pm_runtime.h, so let's fix this here as well.
