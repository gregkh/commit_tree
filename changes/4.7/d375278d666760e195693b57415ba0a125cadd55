staging: comedi: das1800: fix possible NULL dereference

DMA is optional with this driver. If it was not enabled the devpriv->dma
pointer will be NULL.

Fix the possible NULL pointer dereference when trying to disable the DMA
channels in das1800_ai_cancel() and tidy up the comments to fix the
checkpatch.pl issues:
WARNING: line over 80 characters

It's probably harmless in das1800_ai_setup_dma() because the 'desc' pointer
will not be used if DMA is disabled but fix it there also.
