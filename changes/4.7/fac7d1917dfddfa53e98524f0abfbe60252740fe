fix EOPENSTALE bug in do_last()

EOPENSTALE occuring at the last component of a trailing symlink ends up
with do_last() retrying its lookup.  After the symlink body has been
discarded.  The thing is, all this retry_lookup logics in there is not
needed at all - the upper layers will do the right thing if we simply
return that -EOPENSTALE as we would with any other error.  Trying to
microoptimize in do_last() is a lot of headache for no good reason.
