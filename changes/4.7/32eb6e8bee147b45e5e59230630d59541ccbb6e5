MIPS: Netlogic: Fix CP0_EBASE redefinition warnings

A couple of netlogic assembly files define CP0_EBASE to $15, the same as
CP0_PRID in mipsregs.h, and use it for accessing both CP0_PRId and
CP0_EBase registers. However commit 609cf6f2291a ("MIPS: CPS: Early
debug using an ns16550-compatible UART") added a different definition of
CP0_EBASE to mipsregs.h, which included a register select of 1. This
causes harmless build warnings like the following:

  arch/mips/netlogic/common/reset.S:53:0: warning: "CP0_EBASE" redefined
  #define CP0_EBASE $15
  ^
  In file included from arch/mips/netlogic/common/reset.S:41:0:
  ./arch/mips/include/asm/mipsregs.h:63:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
  #define CP0_EBASE $15, 1
  ^

Update the code to use the definitions from mipsregs.h for accessing
both registers.
