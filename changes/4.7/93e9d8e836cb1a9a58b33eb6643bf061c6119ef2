block: add ability to flag write back caching on a device

Add an internal helper and flag for setting whether a queue has
write back caching, or write through (or none). Add a sysfs file
to show this as well, and make it changeable from user space.

This will replace the (awkward) blk_queue_flush() interface that
drivers currently use to inform the block layer of write cache state
and capabilities.
