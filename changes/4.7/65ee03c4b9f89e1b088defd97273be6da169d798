mm: fix overflow in vm_map_ram()

When remapping pages accounting for 4G or more memory space, the
operation 'count << PAGE_SHIFT' overflows as it is performed on an
integer.  Solution: cast before doing the bitshift.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix vm_unmap_ram() also]
[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix vmap() as well, per Guillermo]
