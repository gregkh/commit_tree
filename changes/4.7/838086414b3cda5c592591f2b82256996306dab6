e1000e: keep Rx/Tx HW_VLAN_CTAG in sync

The bit in the e1000 driver that mentions explicitly that the hardware
has no support for separate RX/TX VLAN accel toggling rings true for
e1000e as well, and thus both NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_RX and
NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_TX need to be kept in sync.

Revert a portion of commit 889ad456660461 ("e1000e: keep VLAN interfaces
functional after rxvlan off") since keeping the bits in sync resolves
the original issue.
