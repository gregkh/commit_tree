tty: vt, remove reduntant check

MAX_NR_CONSOLES and MAX_NR_USER_CONSOLES are both 63 since they were
introduced in 1.1.54. And since vc_allocate does:

if (currcons >= MAX_NR_CONSOLES)
	return -ENXIO;

if (!vc_cons[currcons].d) {
	if (currcons >= MAX_NR_USER_CONSOLES && !capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE))
		return -EPERM;
}

the second check is pointless. Remove both the check and the macro
MAX_NR_USER_CONSOLES.
