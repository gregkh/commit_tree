mfd: intel_quark_i2c_gpio: Remove clock tree on error path

There is a potential resource leak in case when ->probe() fails. We have to
unregister and remove clock tree which is done here.

This is a follow up to previously pushed commit c4726abce63b ("mfd:
intel_quark_i2c_gpio: Use clkdev_create()") that prevents double free() when
clkdev_drop() followed by kfree() in devm_kcalloc() release stage.

I leave Fixes tag here, but the backporting will require to backport the commit
c4726abce63b ("mfd: intel_quark_i2c_gpio: Use clkdev_create()") first.
