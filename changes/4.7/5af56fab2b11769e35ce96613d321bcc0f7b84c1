perf tools: Allow generating per-arch syscall table arrays

Tools should use a mechanism similar to arch/x86/entry/syscalls/ to
generate a header file with the definitions for two variables:

  static const char *syscalltbl_x86_64[] = {
	[0] = "read",
	[1] = "write",
  <SNIP>
	[324] = "membarrier",
	[325] = "mlock2",
	[326] = "copy_file_range",
  };
  static const int syscalltbl_x86_64_max_id = 326;

In a per arch file that should then be included in
tools/perf/util/syscalltbl.c.

First one will be for x86_64.
