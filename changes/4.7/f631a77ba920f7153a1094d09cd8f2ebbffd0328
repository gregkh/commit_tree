mac80211: allow same PN for AMSDU sub-frames

Some hardware (iwlwifi an example) de-aggregate AMSDUs and copy the IV
as is to the generated MPDUs, so the same PN appears in multiple
packets without being a replay attack.  Allow driver to explicitly
indicate that a frame is allowed to have the same PN as the previous
frame.
