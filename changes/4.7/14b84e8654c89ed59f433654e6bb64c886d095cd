qed: fix qed_fill_link() error handling

gcc warns about qed_fill_link possibly accessing uninitialized data:

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_main.c: In function 'qed_fill_link':
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_main.c:1170:35: error: 'link_caps' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

While this warning is only about the specific case of CONFIG_QED_SRIOV
being disabled but the function getting called for a VF (which should
never happen), another possibility is that qed_mcp_get_*() fails without
returning data.

This rearranges the code so we bail out in either of the two cases
and print a warning instead of accessing the uninitialized data.

The qed_link_output structure remains untouched in this case, but
all callers first call memset() on it, so at least we are not leaking
stack data then.

As discussed, we also use a compile-time check to ensure we never
use any of the VF code if CONFIG_QED_SRIOV is disabled, and the
PCI device table is updated to no longer bind to virtual functions
in that configuration.
