Change hash_64() return value to 32 bits

That's all that's ever asked for, and it makes the return
type of hash_long() consistent.

It also allows (upcoming patch) an optimized implementation
of hash_64 on 32-bit machines.

I tried adding a BUILD_BUG_ON to ensure the number of bits requested
was never more than 32 (most callers use a compile-time constant), but
adding <linux/bug.h> to <linux/hash.h> breaks the tools/perf compiler
unless tools/perf/MANIFEST is updated, and understanding that code base
well enough to update it is too much trouble.  I did the rest of an
allyesconfig build with such a check, and nothing tripped.
