MIPS: Adjust set_pte() SMP fix to handle R10000_LLSC_WAR

Update the recent changes to set_pte() that were added in 46011e6ea392
to handle R10000_LLSC_WAR, and format the assembly to match other areas
of the MIPS tree using the same WAR.

This also incorporates a patch recently sent in my Markos Chandras,
"Remove local LL/SC preprocessor variants", so that patch doesn't need
to be applied if this one is accepted.
