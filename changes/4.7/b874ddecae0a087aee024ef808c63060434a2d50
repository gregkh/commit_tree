wil6210: switch to generated wmi.h

Switch to auto-generated version of wmi.h which is maintained
by FW team. This will allow better sync between teams in the
future and avoid bugs because of unexpected API changes.
The wmi.h will have many differences but most are cosmetic.
It also includes these real differences:
1. is_go parameter added to BCON_CTRL and START_PCP commands.
2. max_rx_pl_per_desc added to CFG_RX_CHAIN command.
3. various small API updates that are not currently used by
driver.
