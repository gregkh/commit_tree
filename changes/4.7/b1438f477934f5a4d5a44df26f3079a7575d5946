xfs: xfs_iflush_cluster fails to abort on error

When a failure due to an inode buffer occurs, the error handling
fails to abort the inode writeback correctly. This can result in the
inode being reclaimed whilst still in the AIL, leading to
use-after-free situations as well as filesystems that cannot be
unmounted as the inode log items left in the AIL never get removed.

Fix this by ensuring fatal errors from xfs_imap_to_bp() result in
the inode flush being aborted correctly.
