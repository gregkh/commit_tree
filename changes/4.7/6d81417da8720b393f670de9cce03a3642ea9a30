PCI: Widen portdrv service type from 4 bits to 8 bits

The names of port service devices previously used one nibble to encode the
port type and another nibble to encode the service type.  We're about to
add a fifth service type, so change device names to use one *byte* to
encode the service type.

For example, a hotplug port service on a downstream bridge was previously
called "pcie24" and is now called "pcie204".  The "2" encodes the device
type (PCI_EXP_TYPE_DOWNSTREAM - 4), and the "4" (now "04") encodes the
service (PCIE_PORT_SERVICE_HP).
