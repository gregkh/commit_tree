batman-adv: move and restructure batadv_v_ogm_forward

To match our code better to the protocol description of B.A.T.M.A.N. V,
move batadv_v_ogm_forward() out into batadv_v_ogm_process_per_outif()
and move all checks directly deciding whether the OGM should be
forwarded into batadv_v_ogm_forward().
