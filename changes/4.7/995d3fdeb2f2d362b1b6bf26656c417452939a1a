clk: rockchip: reign in some overly long lines in the rk3399 controller

We allow overlong lines in the array portitions describing the clock
trees to ease readability by having each element always at the same
position. But the rest of the code should honor the 80 char limit.

Fix the newly added rk3399 clock code to respect that.
