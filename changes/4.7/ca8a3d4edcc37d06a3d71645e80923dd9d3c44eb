ARM: dts: dra7: fix clock node definitions to avoid build warnings

Upcoming change to DT compiler is going to complain about nodes
which have a reg property, but have not defined the address in their
name. This patch fixes following type of warnings for DRA7 clock nodes:

Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /ocp/cm@48004000/clocks/dpll3_m2_ck
has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
