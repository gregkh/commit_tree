arm64: mm: mark fault_info table const

Unlike the debug_fault_info table, we never intentionally alter the
fault_info table at runtime, and all derived pointers are treated as
const currently.

Make the table const so that it can be placed in .rodata and protected
from unintentional writes, as we do for the syscall tables.
