ARC: Mark secondary cpu online only after all HW setup is done

In SMP setup, master loops for each_present_cpu calling cpu_up().
For ARC it returns as soon as new cpu's status becomes online,
However secondary may still do HW initializing,
machine or platform hook level.

So turn secondary online only after all HW setup is done.
