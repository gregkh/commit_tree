drm/vmwgfx: Kill some lockdep warnings

Some global KMS state that is elsewhere protected by the mode_config
mutex here needs to be protected with a local mutex. Remove corresponding
lockdep checks and introduce a new driver-private global_kms_state_mutex,
and make sure its locking order is *after* the crtc locks in order to
avoid having to release those when the new mutex is taken.
