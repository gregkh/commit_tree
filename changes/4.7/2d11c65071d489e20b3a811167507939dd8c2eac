perf record: Prevent reading invalid data in record__mmap_read

When record__mmap_read() requires data more than the size of ring
buffer, drop those data to avoid accessing invalid memory.

This can happen when reading from overwritable ring buffer, which
should be avoided. However, check this for robustness.
