rcu: Consolidate expedited GP code into rcu_exp_wait_wake()

Currently, synchronize_rcu_expedited() and rcu_sched_expedited() have
significant duplicate code.  This commit therefore consolidates some of
this code into rcu_exp_wake(), which is now renamed to rcu_exp_wait_wake()
in recognition of its added responsibilities.
