i40e: Make VF resets more reliable

Clear the VFLR bit immediately after triggering a reset instead of
waiting until after cleanup is complete. Make sure to trigger a reset
every time, not just if the PF is up.

These changes fix a problem where VF resets would get lost by the PF,
preventing the VF driver from initializing.
