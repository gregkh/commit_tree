e1000e: e1000e_cyclecounter_read(): do overflow check only if needed

SYSTIMH:SYSTIML registers are incremented by 24-bit value TIMINCA[23..0]

er32(SYSTIML) are probably moderately expensive (they are pci bus reads).
Can we avoid one of them? Yes, we can.

If the SYSTIML value we see is smaller than 0xff000000, the overflow
into SYSTIMH would require at least two increments.

We do two reads, er32(SYSTIML) and er32(SYSTIMH), in this order.

Even if one increment happens between them, the overflow into SYSTIMH
is impossible, and we can avoid doing another er32(SYSTIML) read
and overflow check.
