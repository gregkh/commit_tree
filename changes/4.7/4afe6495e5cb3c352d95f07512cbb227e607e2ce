tracing: Don't use the address of the buffer array name in copy_from_user

With the following code snippet:

    ...
    char buf[64];
    ...
    if (copy_from_user(&buf, ubuf, cnt))
    ...

Even though the value of "&buf" equals "buf", but there is no need
to get the address of the "buf" again. Use "buf" instead of "&buf".
