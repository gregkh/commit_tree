rcu: Make cond_resched_rcu_qs() supply RCU-sched expedited QS

Although cond_resched_rcu_qs() supplies quiescent states to all flavors
of normal RCU grace periods, it does nothing for expedited RCU-sched
grace periods.  This commit therefore adds a check for a need for a
quiescent state from the current CPU by an expedited RCU-sched grace
period, and invokes rcu_sched_qs() to supply that quiescent state if so.

Note that the check is racy in that we might be migrated to some other
CPU just after checking the per-CPU variable.  This is OK because the
act of migration will do a context switch, which will supply the needed
quiescent state.  The only downside is that we might do an unnecessary
call to rcu_sched_qs(), but the probability is low and the overhead
is small.
