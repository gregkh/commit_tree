MIPS: smp-cps: Stop printing EJTAG exceptions to UART

When CONFIG_MIPS_CPS_NS16550 is enabled, some register state is dumped
to the UART when an exception is taken via the BEV on secondary cores.
EJTAG exceptions are architecturally expected to be handled by the BEV
even when Status.BEV is 0. This effectively means that if userland
executes an sdbbp instruction on a secondary core then the kernel dumps
register state to the UART even though the exception is perfectly normal
& expected. Prevent this by simply not dumping information to the UART
for EJTAG exceptions.
