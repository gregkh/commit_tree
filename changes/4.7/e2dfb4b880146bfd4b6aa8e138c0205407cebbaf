ARM: fix PTRACE_SETVFPREGS on SMP systems

PTRACE_SETVFPREGS fails to properly mark the VFP register set to be
reloaded, because it undoes one of the effects of vfp_flush_hwstate().

Specifically vfp_flush_hwstate() sets thread->vfpstate.hard.cpu to
an invalid CPU number, but vfp_set() overwrites this with the original
CPU number, thereby rendering the hardware state as apparently "valid",
even though the software state is more recent.

Fix this by reverting the previous change.
