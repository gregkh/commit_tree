MIPS: Fix MSA assembly with big thread offsets

When lockdep is enabled on a 64-bit kernel the FPR offset into the
thread structure exceeds the maximum range of the MSA ld.d/st.d
instructions. For example THREAD_FPR31 = 4644 (instead of 2448), while
the signed immediate field is only 10 bits with an implicit multiply by
8, giving a maximum offset of 511*8 = 4088.

This isn't a problem when the toolchain doesn't support MSA as the
ld_*/st_* macros perform the addition separately into $1 with [d]addui
which has a 16bit signed immediate field.

Fix the case where the toolchain does support MSA by doing a single
addition of THREAD_FPR0 into $1 with [d]addui, and doing the ld_*/st_*
relative to that.
