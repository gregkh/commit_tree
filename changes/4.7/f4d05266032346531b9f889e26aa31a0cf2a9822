device property: don't bother the drivers with struct property_set

Since device_add_property_set() now always takes a copy of
the property_set, and also since the fwnode type is always
hard coded to be FWNODE_PDATA, there is no need for the
drivers to deliver the entire struct property_set. The
function can just create the instance of it on its own and
bind the properties from the drivers to it on the spot.

This renames device_add_property_set() to
device_add_properties(). The function now takes struct
property_entry as its parameter instead of struct
property_set.
