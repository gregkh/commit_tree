ata: sata_dwc_460ex: skip dma setup for non-dma commands

Calling dmaengine_prep_slave_sg() for non-dma ATA commands is
unnecessary at best and could be harmful if the dma driver reacts
badly to this.  It also causes this driver to print a bogus error
message in these cases.

This patch changes sata_dwc_qc_issue() to only do the dma setup
for dma commands and also reports an error to libata if if fails.
