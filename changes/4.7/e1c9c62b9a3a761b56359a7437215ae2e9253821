net/mlx5: Fix mlx5 ifc cmd_hca_cap bad offsets

All reserved fields after early_vf_enable are off by 1, since
early_vf_enable was not explicitly declared as array of size 1.

Reserved field before cqe_zip had a wrong size, it should
be 0x80 + 0x3f.

Fixes: b0844444590e ("net/mlx5_core: Introduce access function to read internal timer ")
Fixes: b4ff3a36d3e4 ("net/mlx5: Use offset based reserved field names in the IFC header file")
