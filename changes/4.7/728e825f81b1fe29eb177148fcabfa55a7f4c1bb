iwlwifi: mvm: add a scan timeout for regular scans

If something goes wrong with the firmware and we never get a scan
complete notification, we stay stuck forever.  In order to avoid this
situation, add a timeout and trigger an NMI if it expires before
receiving the notification., so we can clean things up.
