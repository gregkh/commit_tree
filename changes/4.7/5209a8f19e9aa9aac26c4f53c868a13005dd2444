ARM: dts: da850: disable mdio and eth0 in da850.dtsi

Disable mdio and eth0 in da850.dtsi file. All other
devices are disabled by default and not all boards
will use these devices, so these should be disabled too.

da850-evm.dtb already had status = "okay" for these devices.
da850-enbw-cmc.dts did not, so they were added.
