Eliminate bad hash multipliers from hash_32() and  hash_64()

The "simplified" prime multipliers made very bad hash functions, so get rid
of them.  This completes the work of 689de1d6ca.

To avoid the inefficiency which was the motivation for the "simplified"
multipliers, hash_64() on 32-bit systems is changed to use a different
algorithm.  It makes two calls to hash_32() instead.

drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/af9015.c uses the old GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME_32
for some horrible reason, so it inherits a copy of the old definition.
