x86 isa: add back X86_32 dependency on CONFIG_ISA

Commit b3c1be1b789c ("base: isa: Remove X86_32 dependency") made ISA
support available on x86-64 too.  That's not right - while there are
some LPC-style devices that might be useful still and be based on
ISA-like IP blocks, that is *not* an excuse to try to enable any random
legacy drivers.

Such drivers should be individually enabled and made to perhaps depend
on ISA_DMA_API instead (which we have continued to support on x86-64).
Or we could add another "ISA_XYZ_API" that we support that doesn't
enable random old drivers that aren't even 64-bit clean nor do we have
any test coverage for.

Turning off ISA will now also turn off some drivers that have been
marked as depending on it as part of this series, and that used to work
on modern platforms.

See for example commits ad7afc38eab3..cc736607c86d, which may also need
to be reverted.

This commit means that the warnings that came in due to enabling ISA
widely are now gone again.
