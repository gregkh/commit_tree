powerpc/mm/subpage: Clear RWX bit to indicate no access

Subpage protection used to depend on the _PAGE_USER bit to implement no
access mode. This patch switches that to use _PAGE_RWX. We clear Read,
Write and Execute access from the pte instead of clearing _PAGE_USER
now. This was done so that we can switch to _PAGE_PRIVILEGED in a later
patch.

subpage_protection() returns pte bits that need to be cleared. Instead
of updating the interface to handle no-access in a separate way, it
appears simpler to clear RWX acecss to indicate no access.

We still don't insert hash ptes for no access implied by !_PAGE_RWX.
Hence we should not get PROT_FAULT with change.
