staging: comedi: mite: tidy up kernel messages in mite_steup()

The dev_err() messages with pci_ioremap_bar() fails are just noise.
Remove them.

The 'use_win1' and 'fifo_size' dev_info() messages are also noise
but they may be useful when debugging. Change them to dev_dbg().

Absorb dump_chip_signnature() and change the pr_info() messages
to dev_dbg(). These also might be useful when debugging.
