nl80211: add feature for BSS selection support

Introducing a new feature that the driver can use to
indicate the driver/firmware supports configuration of BSS
selection criteria upon CONNECT command. This can be useful
when multiple BSS-es are found belonging to the same ESS,
ie. Infra-BSS with same SSID. The criteria can then be used to
offload selection of a preferred BSS.
