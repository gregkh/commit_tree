lpfc: Correct LOGO handling during login

After a link bounce, when a remote port issues a LOGO while a REGLOGIN
is pending on that port, the driver does not clean up the ndlp
structure. May result in stack traces in the console log.

Fix: Clear the NLP_REG_LOGIN_SEND flag on the ndlp in the routine
