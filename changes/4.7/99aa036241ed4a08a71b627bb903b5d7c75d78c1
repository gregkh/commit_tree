arm64: secondary_start_kernel: Remove unnecessary barrier

Remove the unnecessary smp_wmb(), which was added to make sure
that the update_cpu_boot_status() completes before we mark the
CPU online. But update_cpu_boot_status() already has dsb() (required
for the failing CPUs) to ensure the correct behavior.
