KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Export register access interface

Userland can access the emulated GIC to save and restore its state
for initialization or migration purposes.
The kvm_io_bus API requires an absolute gpa, which does not fit the
KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS user API, that only provides relative
offsets. So we provide a wrapper to plug into our MMIO framework and
find the respective register handler.
