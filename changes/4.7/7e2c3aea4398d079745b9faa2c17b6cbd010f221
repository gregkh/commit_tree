net: also make sch_handle_egress() drop monitor ready

Follow-up for 8a3a4c6e7b34 ("net: make sch_handle_ingress() drop
monitor ready") to also make the egress side drop monitor ready.

Also here only TC_ACT_SHOT is a clear indication that something
went wrong. Hence don't provide false positives to drop monitors
such as 'perf record -e skb:kfree_skb ...'.
