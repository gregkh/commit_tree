fbdev: fb_defio: Export fb_deferred_io_mmap

Export fb_deferred_io_mmap so drivers can change vma->vm_page_prot.
When the framebuffer memory is allocated using dma_alloc_writecombine()
instead of vmalloc(), I get cache syncing problems on ARM.
This solves it:

static int drm_fbdev_cma_deferred_io_mmap(struct fb_info *info,
					  struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	fb_deferred_io_mmap(info, vma);
	vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vma->vm_page_prot);

	return 0;
}

Could this have been done in the core?
Drivers that don't set (struct fb_ops *)->fb_mmap, gets a call to
fb_pgprotect() at the end of the default fb_mmap implementation
(drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c). This is an architecture specific
function that on many platforms uses pgprot_writecombine(), but not on
all. And looking at some of the fb_mmap implementations, some of them
sets vm_page_prot to nocache for instance, so I think the safest bet is
to do this in the driver and not in the fbdev core. And we can't call
fb_pgprotect() from fb_deferred_io_mmap() either because we don't have
access to the file pointer that powerpc needs.
