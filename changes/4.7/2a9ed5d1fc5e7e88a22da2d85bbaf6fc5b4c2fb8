ixgbe: make 'action' field in struct ixgbe_fdir_filter a u64 value

This field is used to record the RX queue index for a redirect action
passed via ring_cookie field in struct ethtool_rx_flow_spec which is
a u64 value.

For ex: after adding a filter rule to redirect to a VF using ethtool
  # echo 4 > /sys/class/net/p4p1/device/sriov_numvfs
  # ethtool -N p4p1 flow-type ip4 src-ip 192.168.0.1 action 0x100000000

querying for the rule shows the Action as 'Direct to queue 0'

  # ethtool -n p4p1
  4 RX rings available
  Total 1 rules

  Filter: 2045
 	Rule Type: Raw IPv4
	Src IP addr: 192.168.0.1 mask: 0.0.0.0
	Dest IP addr: 0.0.0.0 mask: 255.255.255.255
	TOS: 0x0 mask: 0xff
	Protocol: 0 mask: 0xff
	L4 bytes: 0x0 mask: 0xffffffff
	VLAN EtherType: 0x0 mask: 0xffff
	VLAN: 0x0 mask: 0xffff
	User-defined: 0x0 mask: 0xffffffffffffffff
	Action: Direct to queue 0

With this fix, ethtool will report the right queue index even for VFs.
	Action: Direct to queue 4294967296

Here 4294967296 corresponds to 0x100000000.
We need to update 'ethtool' to report the queue index as a Hex value so
that it is more  user friendly and matches with the 'action' value that
is passed when adding the rule.
