drivers/of: Fix build warning in populate_node()

Function populate_node() is used to unflatten FDT blob to device
tree. It supports maximal 64 level of device nodes. There is one
array @fpsizes[64] tracking the full name length of last unflattened
device node in the corresponding level (index of element in the
array - 1). Build warning is seen with CONFIG_FRAME_WARN=1024 like
below on ARM64 as Geert reported. The issue can be reproduced on
PPC64 as well.

  $ make drivers/of/fdt.o
  drivers/of/fdt.c:443:1: warning: the frame size of 1136 bytes is \
  larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

This changes the data type of @fpsizes[i] from "unsigned long" to
"unsigned int" to avoid the build warning. The return value type
of populate_node() and its @fpsize argument is adjusted accordingly.
With this applied, 256 bytes saved from the stack frame on ARM64 and
PPC64 platforms and the above warning isn't seen.
