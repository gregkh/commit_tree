staging/lustre/osc: add weight function for DLM lock

Use weigh_ast to decide if a lock covers any pages.
In recovery, weigh_ast will be used to decide if a DLM read lock
covers any locked pages, or it will be canceled instead being
recovered.

The problem with the original implementation is that it attached
each osc_page to an osc_lock also changed lock state to add every
pages for readahead.
