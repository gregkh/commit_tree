stmmac: fix parameter to dwmac4_set_umac_addr()

The dwmac4_set_umac_addr() takes a struct mac_device_info as
the first parameter, but is being passed a ioaddr instead from
dwmac4_set_filter(). Fix the warning/bug by changing the first
parameter.

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac4_core.c:159:46: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac4_core.c:159:46:    expected struct mac_device_info *hw
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac4_core.c:159:46:    got void [noderef] <asn:2>*ioaddr

Note, only compile tested this as do not have any
hardware with it in.
