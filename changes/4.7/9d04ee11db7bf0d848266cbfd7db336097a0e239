mei: amthif: discard not read messages

When a message is received and amthif client is not in reading state
the message is ignored and left dangling in the queue. This may happen
after one of the amthif host connections is closed w/o completing the
reading. Another client will pick up a wrong message on next read
attempt which will lead to link reset.
To prevent this the driver has to properly discard the message when
amthif client is not in reading state.
