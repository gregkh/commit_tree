net: alx: use custom skb allocator

This patch follows Eric Dumazet's commit 7b70176421 for Atheros
atl1c driver to fix one exactly same bug in alx driver, that the
network link will be lost in 1-5 minutes after the device is up.

My laptop Lenovo Y580 with Atheros AR8161 ethernet device hit the
same problem with kernel 4.4, and it will be cured by Jarod Wilson's
commit c406700c for alx driver which get merged in 4.5. But there
are still some alx devices can't function well even with Jarod's
patch, while this patch could make them work fine. More details on
	https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70761

The debug shows the issue is very likely to be related with the RX
DMA address, specifically 0x...f80, if RX buffer get 0x...f80 several
times, their will be RX overflow error and device will stop working.

For kernel 4.5.0 with Jarod's patch which works fine with my
AR8161/Lennov Y580, if I made some change to the
	__netdev_alloc_skb
		--> __alloc_page_frag()
to make the allocated buffer can get an address with 0x...f80,
then the same error happens. If I make it to 0x...f40 or 0x....fc0,
everything will be still fine. So I tend to believe that the
0x..f80 address cause the silicon to behave abnormally.
