wil6210: fix no_fw_recovery mode with change_virtual_intf

When FW crashed with no_fw_recovery mode enabled, user space
could still call wil_cfg80211_change_iface quickly to change
interface type, and this would cause recovery to proceed and
FW crash logs may be lost.
Fix this problem by not resetting the FW in case no_fw_recovery
is enabled.
