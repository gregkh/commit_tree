powerpc/mm/book3s: Rename hash specific PTE bits to carry H_ prefix

This helps to make following hash only pte bits easier.

We have kept _PAGE_CHG_MASK, _HPAGE_CHG_MASK and _PAGE_PROT_BITS as it
is in this patch eventhough they use hash specific bits. Using them in
radix as it is should be ok, because with radix we expect those bit
positions to be zero.

Only renames in this patch, no change in functionality.
