IB/srp: Prevent mapping failures

If both max_sectors and the queue_depth are high enough it can
happen that the MR pool is depleted temporarily. This causes
the SRP initiator to report mapping failures. Although the SRP
initiator recovers from such mapping failures, prevent that
this can happen by allocating more memory regions.

Additionally, only enable memory registration if at least two
pages can be registered per memory region.
