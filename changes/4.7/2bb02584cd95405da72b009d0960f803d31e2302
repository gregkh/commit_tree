staging: wilc1000: use completion instead of struct semaphore hif_sema_driver

struct semaphore hif_sema_driver is used to signal completion of host
interface message. This patch replaces struct semaphore hif_sema_driver
with struct completion hif_driver_comp. It is better to use completion
than semaphore for this case.
