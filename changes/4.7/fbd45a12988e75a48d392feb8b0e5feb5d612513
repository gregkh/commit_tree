pwm: Fix pwm_apply_args() call sites

pwm_apply_args() is supposed to initialize a PWM device according to the
arguments provided by the DT or the PWM lookup, but this function was
called inside pwm_device_request(), which in turn was called before the
core had a chance to initialize the pwm->args fields.

Fix that by calling pwm_apply_args directly in pwm_get() and of_pwm_get()
after initializing pwm->args field.

This commit also fixes an invalid pointer dereference introduced by
commit e39c0df1be5a ("pwm: Introduce the pwm_args concept").
