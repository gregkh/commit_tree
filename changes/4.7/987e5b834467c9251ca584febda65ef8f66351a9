MIPS: Fix uapi include in exported asm/siginfo.h

Since commit 8cb48fe169dd ("MIPS: Provide correct siginfo_t.si_stime"),
MIPS' uapi/asm/siginfo.h has included uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h
directly before defining MIPS' struct siginfo, in order to get the
necessary definitions needed for the siginfo struct without the generic
copy_siginfo() hitting compiler errors due to struct siginfo not yet
being defined.

Now that the generic copy_siginfo() is moved out to linux/signal.h we
can safely include asm-generic/siginfo.h before defining the MIPS
specific struct siginfo, which avoids the uapi/ include as well as
breakage due to generic copy_siginfo() being defined before struct
siginfo.
