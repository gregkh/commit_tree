clk: qcom: mmcc-8996: Remove clocks that should be controlled by RPM

The branch clocks MMSS_MMAGIC_AXI_CLK and MMAGIC_BIMC_AXI_CLK are
controlled by RPM when the APPs processor enable or disable the
RPM_MMAXI_CLK.

During the boot sequence, someone can enable the RPM_MMAXI_CLK, resulting
in register status bits showing that these clocks are enabled, our
clock driver may look at the enabled status of these clocks and try to
disable them since it thinks they are unused.

Don't make the clock driver touch these clocks.
