qlge: Replace create_singlethread_workqueue with alloc_ordered_workqueue

Replace deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue with
alloc_ordered_workqueue.

Work items include getting tx/rx frame sizes, resetting MPI processor,
setting asic recovery bit so ordering seems necessary as only one work
item should be in queue/executing at any given time, hence the use of
alloc_ordered_workqueue.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag has been set since ethernet devices seem to sit in
memory reclaim path, so to guarantee forward progress regardless of
memory pressure.
