ARM: tegra: Fix copy/paste typo in several DTS includes

The comment about the 8250 vs. APB DMA-enabled UART devices that was
added for Tegra20 and Tegra30 in commit b6551bb933f9 ("ARM: tegra: dts:
add aliases and DMA requestor for serial controller") introduced a typo
that has since spread to various other DTS include files. Fix all
occurrences of this typo.
