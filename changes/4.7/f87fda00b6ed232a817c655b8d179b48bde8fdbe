bonding: prevent out of bound accesses

ether_addr_equal_64bits() requires some care about its arguments,
namely that 8 bytes might be read, even if last 2 byte values are not
used.

KASan detected a violation with null_mac_addr and lacpdu_mcast_addr
in bond_3ad.c

Same problem with mac_bcast[] and mac_v6_allmcast[] in bond_alb.c :
Although the 8-byte alignment was there, KASan would detect out
of bound accesses.

Fixes: 815117adaf5b ("bonding: use ether_addr_equal_unaligned for bond addr compare")
Fixes: bb54e58929f3 ("bonding: Verify RX LACPDU has proper dest mac-addr")
Fixes: 885a136c52a8 ("bonding: use compare_ether_addr_64bits() in ALB")
