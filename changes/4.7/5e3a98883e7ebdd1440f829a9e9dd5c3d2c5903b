pnfs_nfs: fix _cancel_empty_pagelist

pnfs_generic_commit_cancel_empty_pagelist calls nfs_commitdata_release,
but that is wrong: nfs_commitdata_release puts the open context, something
that isn't valid until nfs_init_commit is called, which is never the case
when pnfs_generic_commit_cancel_empty_pagelist is called.

This was introduced in "nfs: avoid race that crashes nfs_init_commit".
