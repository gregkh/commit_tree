net: phy: dp83867: Fix initialization of PHYCR register

When initializing the PHY control register, the FIFO depth bits are
written without reading the previous register value, i.e. all other
bits are overwritten with zero. This disables automatic MDI-X
configuration, which is enabled by default. Fix initialization by doing
a read/modify/write operation.
