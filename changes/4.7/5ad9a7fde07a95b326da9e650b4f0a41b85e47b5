acpi/nfit: Update nfit driver to comply with ACPI 6.1

ACPI 6.1, Table 5-133, updates NVDIMM Control Region Structure
as follows.
 - Valid Fields, Manufacturing Location, and Manufacturing Date
   are added from reserved range.  No change in the structure size.
 - IDs (SPD values) are stored as arrays of bytes (i.e. big-endian
   format).  The spec clarifies that they need to be represented
   as arrays of bytes as well.

This patch makes the following changes to support this update.
 - Change the NFIT driver to show SPD ID values in big-endian
   format.
 - Change sprintf format to use "0x" instead of "#" since "%#02x"
   does not prepend '0'.
