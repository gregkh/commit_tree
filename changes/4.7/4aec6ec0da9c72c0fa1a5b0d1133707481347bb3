cxl: Increase timeout for detection of AFU mmio hang

PSL designers recommend a larger value for the mmio hang pulse, 256 us
instead of 1 us. The CAIA architecture states that it needs to be
smaller than 1/2 of the RTOS timeout set in the PHB for outbound
non-posted transactions, which is still (easily) the case here.
