powerpc/powernv: Use PE instead of number during setup and release

In current implementation, the PEs that are allocated or picked
from the reserved list are identified by PE number. The PE instance
has to be picked according to the PE number eventually. We have
same issue when PE is released.

For pnv_ioda_pick_m64_pe() and pnv_ioda_alloc_pe(), this returns
PE instance so that pnv_ioda_setup_bus_PE() can use the allocated
or reserved PE instance directly. Also, pnv_ioda_setup_bus_PE()
returns the reserved/allocated PE instance to be used in subsequent
patches. On the other hand, pnv_ioda_free_pe() uses PE instance
(not number) as its argument. No logical changes introduced.
