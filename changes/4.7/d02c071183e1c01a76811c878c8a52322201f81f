sched/fair: Reset nr_balance_failed after active balancing

To force a task migration during active balancing, nr_balance_failed is set
to cache_nice_tries + 1. However nr_balance_failed is not reset. As a side
effect, the next regular load balance under the same sd, a cache hot task
might be migrated, just because nr_balance_failed count is high.

Resetting nr_balance_failed after a successful active balance ensures
that a hot task is not unreasonably migrated. This can be verified by
looking at othe number of hot task migrations reported by /proc/schedstat.
