MIPS: math-emu: Fix code indentation

A line incrementing the re variable was indented a level too deep in
ieee754dp_mul, making the code unclear to read. Fix the indentation.
This appears to have been copied verbatim along with the rest of the
multiplication code to ieee754dp_maddf, now _dp_maddf, too so fix the
indentation there too.
