perf tools: Support reading from backward ring buffer

perf_evlist__mmap_read_backward() is introduced for reading backward
ring buffer. Since direction for reading such ring buffer is different
from the direction kernel writing to it, and since user need to fetch
most recent record from it, a perf_evlist__mmap_read_catchup() is
introduced to move the reading pointer to the end of the buffer.
