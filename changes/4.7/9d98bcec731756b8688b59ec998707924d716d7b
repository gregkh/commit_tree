x86/ioapic: Fix incorrect pointers in ioapic_setup_resources()

On a 4-socket Brickland system, hot-removing one ioapic is fine.
Hot-removing the 2nd one causes panic in mp_unregister_ioapic()
while calling release_resource().

It is because the iomem_res pointer has already been released
when removing the first ioapic.

To explain the use of &res[num] here: res is assigned to ioapic_resources,
and later in ioapic_insert_resources() we do:

	struct resource *r = ioapic_resources;

        for_each_ioapic(i) {
                insert_resource(&iomem_resource, r);
                r++;
        }

Here 'r' is treated as an arry of 'struct resource', and the r++ ensures
that each element of the array is inserted separately. Thus we should call
release_resouce() on each element at &res[num].

Fix it by assigning the correct pointers to ioapics[i].iomem_res in
ioapic_setup_resources().
