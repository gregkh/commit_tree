dmaengine: mv_xor: make the code 64 bits compliant

Fix two warnings which appear when building for 64 bits target:

drivers/dma/mv_xor.c: In function ‘mv_xor_prep_dma_xor’:
drivers/dma/mv_xor.c:480:3: warning: format ‘%u’ expects argument of type ‘unsigned int’, but argument 6 has type ‘size_t {aka long unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]
   "%s src_cnt: %d len: %u dest %pad flags: %ld\n",
   ^
drivers/dma/mv_xor.c: In function ‘mv_xor_probe’:
drivers/dma/mv_xor.c:1223:17: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
    op_in_desc = (int)of_id->data;
                 ^
