mlx5: avoid unused variable warning

When CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT is disabled, we get a new warning in the mlx5
ethernet driver because the tc_for_each_action() loop never references
the iterator:

mellanox/mlx5/core/en_tc.c: In function 'mlx5e_stats_flower':
mellanox/mlx5/core/en_tc.c:431:20: error: unused variable 'a' [-Werror=unused-variable]
  struct tc_action *a;

This changes the dummy tc_for_each_action() macro by adding a
cast to void, letting the compiler know that the variable is
intentionally declared but not used here. I could not come up
with a nicer workaround, but this seems to do the trick.
