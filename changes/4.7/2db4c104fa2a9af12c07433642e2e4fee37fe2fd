KVM: arm/arm64: Get rid of vgic_cpu->nr_lr

The number of list registers is a property of the underlying system, not
of emulated VGIC CPU interface.

As we are about to move this variable to global state in the new vgic
for clarity, move it from the legacy implementation as well to make the
merge of the new code easier.
