i2c: at91: change log when dma configuration fails

When the DMA configuration fails, there is a log reporting that we can't
use DMA and indicating the error number. When booting the kernel, it is
annoying to see this error number. Moreover, people can think something
is going wrong. It is not the case, it means that DMA can't be used but
it doesn't prevent to use i2c.
