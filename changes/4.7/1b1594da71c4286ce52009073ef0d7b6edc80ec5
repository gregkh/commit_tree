staging: lustre: llite: Truncate to restore file

Truncate up is safe so it won't trigger restore.

Copy optimization for truncate down - only copy the part under
truncate length. If a file is truncated to zero usually it'll be
followed by write so I choose to restore the file and set correct
stripe information.
