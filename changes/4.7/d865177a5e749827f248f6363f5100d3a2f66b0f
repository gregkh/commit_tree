Btrfs: clear uptodate flags of pages in sys_array eb

We set uptodate flag to pages in the temporary sys_array eb,
but do not clear the flag after free eb.  As the special
btree inode may still hold a reference on those pages, the
uptodate flag can remain alive in them.

If btrfs_super_chunk_root has been intentionally changed to the
offset of this sys_array eb, reading chunk_root will read content
of sys_array and it will skip our beautiful checks in
btree_readpage_end_io_hook() because of
"pages of eb are uptodate => eb is uptodate"

This adds the 'clear uptodate' part to force it to read from disk.
