ASoC: rsnd: count .probe/.remove for rsnd_mod_call()

Current rsnd_mod_call is counting its calling count to avoid unbalanced
function pair calling for error cases (ex init <-> quit).
SSI parent is now controlled as "mod" on current rsnd driver. Because of
this reason, SSI .remove function will be called twice if it was used as
SSI parent when user tried unbind. But probe/remove pair were not
counted. This patch counts probe/remove functions to avoid it.
