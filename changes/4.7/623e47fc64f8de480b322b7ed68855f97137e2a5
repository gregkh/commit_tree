zram: introduce per-device debug_stat sysfs node

debug_stat sysfs is read-only and represents various debugging data that
zram developers may need.  This file is not meant to be used by anyone
else: its content is not documented and will change any time w/o any
notice.  Therefore, the output of debug_stat file contains a version
string.  To avoid any confusion, we will increase the version number
every time we modify the output.

At the moment this file exports only one value -- the number of
re-compressions, IOW, the number of times compression fast path has
failed.  This stat is temporary any will be useful in case if any
per-cpu compression streams regressions will be reported.
