MIPS: Handle highmem pages in __update_cache

The following patch will expose __update_cache to highmem pages. Handle
them by mapping them in for the duration of the cache maintenance, just
like in __flush_dcache_page. The code for that isn't shared because we
need the page address in __update_cache so sharing became messy. Given
that the entirity is an extra 5 lines, just duplicate it.
