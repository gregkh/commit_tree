net/ipv6/addrconf: simplify sysctl registration

Struct ctl_table_header holds pointer to sysctl table which could be used
for freeing it after unregistration. IPv4 sysctls already use that.
Remove redundant NULL assignment: ndev allocated using kzalloc.

This also saves some bytes: sysctl table could be shorter than
DEVCONF_MAX+1 if some options are disable in config.
