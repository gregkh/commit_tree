rcutorture: Remove redundant initialization to zero

The current code initializes the global per-CPU variables
rcu_torture_count and rcu_torture_batch to zero.  However, C does this
initialization by default, and explicit initialization of per-CPU
variables now needs a different syntax if "make tags" is to work.
This commit therefore removes the initialization.
