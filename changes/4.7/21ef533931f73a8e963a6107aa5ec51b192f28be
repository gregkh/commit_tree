radix-tree: add support for multi-order iterating

This enables the macros radix_tree_for_each_slot() and friends to be
used with multi-order entries.

The way that this works is that we treat all entries in a given slots[]
array as a single chunk.  If the index given to radix_tree_next_chunk()
happens to point us to a sibling entry, we will back up iter->index so
that it points to the canonical entry, and that will be the place where
we start our iteration.

As we're processing a chunk in radix_tree_next_slot(), we process
canonical entries, skip over sibling entries, and restart the chunk
lookup if we find a non-sibling indirect pointer.  This drops back to
the radix_tree_next_chunk() code, which will re-walk the tree and look
for another chunk.

This allows us to properly handle multi-order entries mixed with other
entries that are at various heights in the radix tree.
