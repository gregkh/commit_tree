KVM: LAPIC: cap __delay at lapic_timer_advance_ns

The host timer which emulates the guest LAPIC TSC deadline
timer has its expiration diminished by lapic_timer_advance_ns
nanoseconds. Therefore if, at wait_lapic_expire, a difference
larger than lapic_timer_advance_ns is encountered, delay at most
lapic_timer_advance_ns.

This fixes a problem where the guest can cause the host
to delay for large amounts of time.
