qed: Align TLVs

As the VF infrastructure is supposed to offer backward/forward
compatibility, the various types associated with VF<->PF communication
should be aligned across all various platforms that support IOV
on our family of adapters.

This adds a couple of currently missing values, specifically aligning
the enum for the various TLVs possible in the communication between them.

It then adds the PF implementation for some of those missing VF requests.
This support isn't really necessary for the Linux VF as those VFs aren't
requiring it [at least today], but are required by VFs running on other
OSes. LRO is an example of one such configuration.
