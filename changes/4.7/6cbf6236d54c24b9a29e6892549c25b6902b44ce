cfg80211: remove get/set antenna and tx power warnings

Since set_tx_power and set_antenna are frequently implemented
without the matching get_tx_power/get_antenna, we shouldn't
have added warnings for those. Remove them.

The remaining ones are correct and need to be implemented
symmetrically for correct operation.
