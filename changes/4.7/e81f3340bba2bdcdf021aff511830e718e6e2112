eCryptfs: Do not allocate hash tfm in NORECLAIM context

You cannot allocate crypto tfm objects in NORECLAIM or NOFS contexts.
The ecryptfs code currently does exactly that for the MD5 tfm.

This patch fixes it by preallocating the MD5 tfm in a safe context.

The MD5 tfm is also reentrant so this patch removes the superfluous
cs_hash_tfm_mutex.
