mac80211: Fix mesh estab_plinks counting in STA removal case

If a user space program (e.g., wpa_supplicant) deletes a STA entry that
is currently in NL80211_PLINK_ESTAB state, the number of established
plinks counter was not decremented and this could result in rejecting
new plink establishment before really hitting the real maximum plink
limit. For !user_mpm case, this decrementation is handled by
mesh_plink_deactive().

Fix this by decrementing estab_plinks on STA deletion
(mesh_sta_cleanup() gets called from there) so that the counter has a
correct value and the Beacon frame advertisement in Mesh Configuration
element shows the proper value for capability to accept additional
peers.
