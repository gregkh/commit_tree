tcp: do not mess with listener sk_wmem_alloc

When removing sk_refcnt manipulation on synflood, I missed that
using skb_set_owner_w() was racy, if sk->sk_wmem_alloc had already
transitioned to 0.

We should hold sk_refcnt instead, but this is a big deal under attack.
(Doing so increase performance from 3.2 Mpps to 3.8 Mpps only)

In this patch, I chose to not attach a socket to syncookies skb.

Performance is now 5 Mpps instead of 3.2 Mpps.

Following patch will remove last known false sharing in
tcp_rcv_state_process()
