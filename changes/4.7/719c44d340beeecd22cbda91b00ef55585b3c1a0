packet: compat support for sock_fprog

Socket option PACKET_FANOUT_DATA takes a struct sock_fprog as argument
if PACKET_FANOUT has mode PACKET_FANOUT_CBPF. This structure contains
a pointer into user memory. If userland is 32-bit and kernel is 64-bit
the two disagree about the layout of struct sock_fprog.

Add compat setsockopt support to convert a 32-bit compat_sock_fprog to
a 64-bit sock_fprog. This is analogous to compat_sock_fprog support for
SO_REUSEPORT added in commit 1957598840f4 ("soreuseport: add compat
case for setsockopt SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF").
