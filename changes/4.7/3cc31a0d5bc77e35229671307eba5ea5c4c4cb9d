btrfs: pass number of devices to btrfs_check_raid_min_devices

Before this patch, btrfs_check_raid_min_devices would do an off-by-one
check of the constraints and not the miminmum check, as its name
suggests. This is not a problem if the only caller is device remove, but
would be confusing for others.

Add an argument with the exact number and let the caller(s) decide if
this needs any adjustments, like when device replace is running.
