MIPS: Fix write_gc0_* macros when writing zero

The versions of the __write_{32,64}bit_gc0_register() macros for when
there is no virt support in the assembler use the "J" inline asm
constraint to allow integer zero, but this needs to be accompanied by
the "z" formatting string so that it turns into $0. Fix both macros to
do this.
