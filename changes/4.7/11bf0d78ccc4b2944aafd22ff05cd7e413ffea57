hwmon: (fam15h_power) Introduce a cpu accumulated power reporting algorithm

This patch introduces an algorithm that computes the average power by
reading a delta value of “core power accumulator” register during
measurement interval, and then dividing delta value by the length of
the time interval.

User is able to use power1_average entry to measure the processor power
consumption and power1_average_interval entry to set the interval.

A simple example:

ray@hr-ub:~/tip$ sensors
fam15h_power-pci-00c4
Adapter: PCI adapter
power1:       19.58 mW (avg =   2.55 mW, interval =   0.01 s)
                       (crit =  15.00 W)

...

The result is current average processor power consumption in 10
millisecond. The unit of the result is uWatt.
