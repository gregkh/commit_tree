xfs: better xfs_trans_alloc interface

Merge xfs_trans_reserve and xfs_trans_alloc into a single function call
that returns a transaction with all the required log and block reservations,
and which allows passing transaction flags directly to avoid the cumbersome
_xfs_trans_alloc interface.

While we're at it we also get rid of the transaction type argument that has
been superflous since we stopped supporting the non-CIL logging mode.  The
guts of it will be removed in another patch.
