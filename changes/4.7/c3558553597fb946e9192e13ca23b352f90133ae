staging: lustre: llite: reset writeback index in ll_writepages

Otherwise after one round the writeback index will become beyond
the file size and ->writepages() turns into an empty operation.

Also, a safety guard is added to limit the wait time for grant to
10 minutes(take recovery into consideration) at maximum in the
osc_enter_cache() function. Otherwise, EDQUOT will be returned to
the applications to start sync write.
