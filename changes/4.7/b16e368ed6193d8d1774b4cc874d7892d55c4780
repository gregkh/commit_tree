can: janz-ican3: error handling for CAL/CANopen firmware

My patch of May 2015 was missing the changed handling of error
indications. With CAL/CANopen firmware the NMTS-SlaveEventIndication
must be used instead of CAN-EventIndication. An appropriate slave node
must be configured to report the errors.

In our department (about 15 development systems with Janz ICAN3-
modules with firmware 1.48, my system also with firmware ICANOS 1.35)
we use the driver with this patch for about one year: no known problems.
