posix_cpu_timer: Exit early when process has been reaped

Variable "now" seems to be genuinely used unintialized
if branch

	if (CPUCLOCK_PERTHREAD(timer->it_clock)) {

is not taken and branch

	if (unlikely(sighand == NULL)) {

is taken. In this case the process has been reaped and the timer is marked as
disarmed anyway. So none of the postprocessing of the sample is
required. Return right away.
