regulator: core: Don't terminate supply resolution early

The function regulator_register_resolve_supply() is called from the
context of class_for_each_dev() (during the regulator registration) to
resolve any supplies added. regulator_register_resolve_supply() will
return an error if a regulator's supply cannot be resolved and this will
terminate the loop in class_for_each_dev(). This means that we will not
attempt to resolve any other supplies after one has failed. Hence, this
may delay the resolution of other regulator supplies until the failing
one itself can be resolved.

Rather than terminating the loop early, don't return an error code and
keep attempting to resolve any other supplies for regulators that have
been registered.
