dmaengine: bcm2835: limit max length based on channel type

The bcm2835 dma system has 2 basic types of dma-channels:
* "normal" channels
* "light" channels

Lite channels are limited in several aspects:
* internal data-structure is 128 bit (not 256)
* does not support BCM2835_DMA_TDMODE (2D)
* DMA length register is limited to 16 bit.
  so 0-65535 (not 0-65536 as mentioned in the official datasheet)
* BCM2835_DMA_S/D_IGNORE are not supported

The detection of the type of mode is implemented by looking at
the LITE bit in the DEBUG register for each channel.
This allows automatic detection.

Based on this the maximum block size is set to (64K - 4) or to 1G
and this limit is honored during generation of control block
chains. The effect is that when a LITE channel is used more
control blocks are used to do the same transfer (compared
to a normal channel).

As there are several sources/target DREQS that are 32 bit wide
we need to have the transfer to be a multiple of 4 as this would
break the transfer otherwise.

This is why the limit of (64K - 4) was chosen over the
alternative of (64K - 4K).
