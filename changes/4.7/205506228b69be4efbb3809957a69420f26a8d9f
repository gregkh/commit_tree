tracing: Do not inherit event-fork option for instances

As the event-fork option requires doing work when enabled and disabled, it
can not be passed down to created instances. The instance must clear this
flag when it is created, and must clear it when its removed.

As more options may be created with this need, a macro ZEROED_TRACE_FLAGS is
created that holds the flags that must not be inherited by the top level
instance, and must be cleared on removal of instances.
