drm: Drop connector argument from __drm_atomic_helper_connector_destroy_state

It's unused, and really this helper should only look at the state
structure and nothing else. Note that this conflicts with a patch from
Dave that adds refcounting to drm_connectors. It's not yet clear
whether the check Dave adds for connector != NULL is really needed or
the right check.

v2: Fix commmit message (Laurent).
