power: reset: at91-shdwc: add new shutdown controller driver

Sama5d2 SoC has a completely new shutdown controller with new features and
register layout. It thus makes sense to add a new driver for this new
peripheral.

This driver is Device Tree only and handles events from the wake-up pin and
the RTC.
As the register layout may change in the future, so some values are encoded
in a configuration structure.
