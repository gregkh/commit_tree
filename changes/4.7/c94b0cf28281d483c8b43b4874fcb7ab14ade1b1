arm64: hyp/kvm: Make hyp-stub reject kvm_call_hyp()

A later patch implements kvm_arch_hardware_disable(), to remove kvm
from el2, and re-instate the hyp-stub.

This can happen while guests are running, particularly when kvm_reboot()
calls kvm_arch_hardware_disable() on each cpu. This can interrupt a guest,
remove kvm, then allow the guest to be scheduled again. This causes
kvm_call_hyp() to be run against the hyp-stub.

Change the hyp-stub to return a new exception type when this happens,
and add code to kvm's handle_exit() to tell userspace we failed to
enter the guest.
