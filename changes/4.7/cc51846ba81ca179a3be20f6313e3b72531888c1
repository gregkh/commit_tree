pwm: atmel-hlcdc: Fix default PWM polarity

The PWM device exposed by the HLCDC IP is configured with an inverted
polarity by default. Registering the PWM chip with the normal polarity
was not a problem before commit 42e8992c58d4 ("pwm: Add core
infrastructure to allow atomic updates") because the ->set_polarity()
hook was called no matter the current polarity state, but this is no longer
the case.
