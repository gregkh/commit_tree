netfilter: nf_tables: reject loops from set element jump to chain

Liping Zhang says:

"Users may add such a wrong nft rules successfully, which will cause an
endless jump loop:

  # nft add rule filter test tcp dport vmap {1: jump test}

This is because before we commit, the element in the current anonymous
set is inactive, so osp->walk will skip this element and miss the
validate check."

To resolve this problem, this patch passes the generation mask to the
walk function through the iter container structure depending on the code
path:

1) If we're dumping the elements, then we have to check if the element
   is active in the current generation. Thus, we check for the current
   bit in the genmask.

2) If we're checking for loops, then we have to check if the element is
   active in the next generation, as we're in the middle of a
   transaction. Thus, we check for the next bit in the genmask.

Based on original patch from Liping Zhang.
