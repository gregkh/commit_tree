mm: vmscan: reduce size of inactive file list

The inactive file list should still be large enough to contain readahead
windows and freshly written file data, but it no longer is the only
source for detecting multiple accesses to file pages.  The workingset
refault measurement code causes recently evicted file pages that get
accessed again after a shorter interval to be promoted directly to the
active list.

With that mechanism in place, we can afford to (on a larger system)
dedicate more memory to the active file list, so we can actually cache
more of the frequently used file pages in memory, and not have them
pushed out by streaming writes, once-used streaming file reads, etc.

This can help things like database workloads, where only half the page
cache can currently be used to cache the database working set.  This
patch automatically increases that fraction on larger systems, using the
same ratio that has already been used for anonymous memory.
