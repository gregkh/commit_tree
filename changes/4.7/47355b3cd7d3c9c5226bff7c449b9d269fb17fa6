IB/core: Fix bit curruption in ib_device_cap_flags structure

ib_device_cap_flags 64-bit expansion caused caps overlapping
and made consumers read wrong device capabilities. For example
IB_DEVICE_SG_GAPS_REG was falsely read by the iser driver causing
it to use a non-existing capability. This happened because signed
int becomes sign extended when converted it to u64. Fix this by
casting IB_DEVICE_ON_DEMAND_PAGING enumeration to ULL.
