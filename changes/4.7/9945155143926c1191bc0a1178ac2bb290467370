powerpc/powernv/ioda1: M64 support on P7IOC

This enables M64 window on P7IOC, which has been enabled on PHB3.
Different from PHB3 where 16 M64 BARs are supported and each of
them can be owned by one particular PE# exclusively or divided
evenly to 256 segments, every P7IOC PHB has 16 M64 BARs and each
of them are divided to 8 segments. So every P7IOC PHB supports
128 M64 segments in total. P7IOC has M64DT, which helps mapping
one particular M64 segment# to arbitrary PE#. PHB3 doesn't have
M64DT, indicating that one M64 segment can only be pinned to the
fixed PE#.

In order to unified M64 support M64 on P7IOC and PHB3, we just
provide 128 M64 segments on every P7IOC PHB and each of them is
pinned to the fixed PE# by bypassing the function of M64DT. In
turn, we just need different phb->init_m64() for P7IOC and PHB3
and maps M64 segment in pnv_ioda_reserve_m64_pe() for P7IOC, most
of the code are shared by them.
