ipv4: Fix ip_skb_dst_mtu to use the sk passed by ip_finish_output

ip_skb_dst_mtu uses skb->sk, assuming it is an AF_INET socket (e.g. it
calls ip_sk_use_pmtu which casts sk as an inet_sk).

However, in the case of UDP tunneling, the skb->sk is not necessarily an
inet socket (could be AF_PACKET socket, or AF_UNSPEC if arriving from
tun/tap).

OTOH, the sk passed as an argument throughout IP stack's output path is
the one which is of PMTU interest:
 - In case of local sockets, sk is same as skb->sk;
 - In case of a udp tunnel, sk is the tunneling socket.

Fix, by passing ip_finish_output's sk to ip_skb_dst_mtu.
This augments 7026b1ddb6 'netfilter: Pass socket pointer down through okfn().'
