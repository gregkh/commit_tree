net: mediatek: fix threshold value

The logic to calculate the threshold value for stopping the TX queue is
bad. Currently it will always use 1/2 of the rings size, which is way too
much. Set the threshold to MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This makes sure that the queue
is stopped when there is not enough room to accept an additional segment.Â
