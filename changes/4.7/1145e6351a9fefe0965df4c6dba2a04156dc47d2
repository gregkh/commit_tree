lightnvm: implement nvm_submit_ppa_list

The nvm_submit_ppa function assumes that users manage all plane
blocks as a single block. Extend the API with nvm_submit_ppa_list
to allow the user to send its own ppa list. If the user submits more
than a single PPA, the user must take care to allocate and free
the corresponding ppa list.
