fm10k: use 8bit notation instead of 10bit notation for diagram

The diagram represents bit layout of the multi-bit VLAN update message
format. Typically these diagrams are drawn using some power of 2 as the
base, to more easily grasp where fields split. Although the numbers
above can make it somewhat easy to understand which bit you're looking
at, it makes the break points not line up. Re-draw the numbers using
base 8, and mark the bit values every 8 bits at the top. This should
make it more easy to grasp the table quickly.
