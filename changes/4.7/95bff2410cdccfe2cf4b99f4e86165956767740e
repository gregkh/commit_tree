MIPS: math-emu: Fix bit-width in ieee754dp_{mul, maddf, msubf} comments

A comment in ieee754dp_mul indicates that the code is about to perform a
32b x 32b multiplication & keep the high 32b of the result. It appears
this was copied from the single-precision multiplication code, since the
code actually goes on to perform a 64b x 64b multiplication & keep the
high 64b of the result. Fix the comment to indicate 64b.

It appears also that this comment was copied verbatim along with the
rest of the multiplication code into ieee754dp_maddf, which has since
been renamed _dp_maddf. Fix the same issue there.
