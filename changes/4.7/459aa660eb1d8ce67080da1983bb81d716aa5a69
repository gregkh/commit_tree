gtp: add initial driver for datapath of GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP-U)

This is an initial implementation of a netdev driver for GTP datapath
(GTP-U) v0 and v1, according to the GSM TS 09.60 and 3GPP TS 29.060
standards. This tunneling protocol is used to prevent subscribers from
accessing mobile carrier core network infrastructure.

This implementation requires a GGSN userspace daemon that implements the
signaling protocol (GTP-C), such as OpenGGSN [1]. This userspace daemon
updates the PDP context database that represents active subscriber
sessions through a genetlink interface.

For more context on this tunneling protocol, you can check the slides
that were presented during the NetDev 1.1 [2].

Only IPv4 is supported at this time.
