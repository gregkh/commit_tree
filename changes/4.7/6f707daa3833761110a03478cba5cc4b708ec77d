PM / OPP: Add dev_pm_opp_get_sharing_cpus()

OPP core allows a platform to mark OPP table as shared, when the
platform isn't using operating-points-v2 bindings.

And, so there should be a non DT way of finding out if the OPP table is
shared or not.

This patch adds dev_pm_opp_get_sharing_cpus(), which first tries to get
OPP sharing information from the opp-table (in case it is already marked
as shared), otherwise it uses the existing DT way of finding sharing
information.
