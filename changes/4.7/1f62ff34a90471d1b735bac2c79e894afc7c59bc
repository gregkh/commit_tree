driver-core: use 'dev' argument in dev_dbg_ratelimited stub

dev_dbg_ratelimited() is a macro that ignores its first argument when DEBUG is
not set, which can lead to unused variable warnings:

ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/pci.c: In function 'mlxsw_pci_cqe_sdq_handle':
ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/pci.c:646:18: warning: unused variable 'pdev' [-Wunused-variable]
ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/pci.c: In function 'mlxsw_pci_cqe_rdq_handle':
ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/pci.c:671:18: warning: unused variable 'pdev' [-Wunused-variable]

The macro already ensures that all its other arguments are silently
ignored by the compiler without triggering a warning, through the
use of the no_printk() macro, but the dev argument is not passed into
that.

This changes the definition to use the same trick as no_printk() with
an if(0) that leads the compiler to not evaluate the side-effects but
still see that 'dev' might not be unused.
