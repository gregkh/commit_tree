bpf, x86: add support for constant blinding

This patch adds recently added constant blinding helpers into the
x86 eBPF JIT. In the bpf_int_jit_compile() path, requirements are
to utilize bpf_jit_blind_constants()/bpf_jit_prog_release_other()
pair for rewriting the program into a blinded one, and to map the
BPF_REG_AX register to a CPU register. The mapping of BPF_REG_AX
is at non-callee saved register r10, and thus shared with cached
skb->data used for ld_abs/ind and not in every program type needed.
When blinding is not used, there's zero additional overhead in the
generated image.
