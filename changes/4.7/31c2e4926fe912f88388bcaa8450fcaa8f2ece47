udp: do not expect udp headers in recv cmsg IP_CMSG_CHECKSUM

On udp sockets, recv cmsg IP_CMSG_CHECKSUM returns a checksum over
the packet payload. Since commit e6afc8ace6dd pulled the headers,
taking skb->data as the start of transport header is incorrect. Use
the transport header pointer.

Also, when peeking at an offset from the start of the packet, only
return a checksum from the start of the peeked data. Note that the
cmsg does not subtract a tail checkum when reading truncated data.

Fixes: e6afc8ace6dd ("udp: remove headers from UDP packets before queueing")
