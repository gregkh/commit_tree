btrfs: use dynamic allocation for root item in create_subvol

The size of root item is more than 400 bytes, which is quite a lot of
stack space. As we do IO from inside the subvolume ioctls, we should
keep the stack usage low in case the filesystem is on top of other
layers (NFS, device mapper, iscsi, etc).
