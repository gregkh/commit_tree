net sched actions: bug fix dumping actions directly didnt produce NLMSG_DONE

This refers to commands to direct action access as follows:

sudo tc actions add action drop index 12
sudo tc actions add action pipe index 10

And then dumping them like so:
sudo tc actions ls action gact

iproute2 worked because it depended on absence of TCA_ACT_TAB TLV
as end of message.
This fix has been tested with iproute2 and is backward compatible.
