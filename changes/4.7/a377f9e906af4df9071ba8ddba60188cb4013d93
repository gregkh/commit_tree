USB: serial: cp210x: fix hardware flow-control disable

A bug in the CRTSCTS handling caused RTS to alternate between

CRTSCTS=0 => "RTS is transmit active signal" and
CRTSCTS=1 => "RTS is used for receive flow control"

instead of

CRTSCTS=0 => "RTS is statically active" and
CRTSCTS=1 => "RTS is used for receive flow control"

This only happened after first having enabled CRTSCTS.
