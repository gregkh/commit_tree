drm/i915: Move shared dpll struct definitions to separate header file

Move the declarations related to shared dplls from i915_drv.h to their
own header file.

The code that became the shared dpll infrastructre was first introcude
in commit ee7b9f93fd96 ("drm/i915: manage PCH PLLs separately from
pipes"), hence the 2012-2016 copyright years in the new header file.
