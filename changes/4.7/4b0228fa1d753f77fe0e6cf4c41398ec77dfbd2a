dax: for truncate/hole-punch, do zeroing through the driver if possible

In the truncate or hole-punch path in dax, we clear out sub-page ranges.
If these sub-page ranges are sector aligned and sized, we can do the
zeroing through the driver instead so that error-clearing is handled
automatically.

For sub-sector ranges, we still have to rely on clear_pmem and have the
possibility of tripping over errors.
