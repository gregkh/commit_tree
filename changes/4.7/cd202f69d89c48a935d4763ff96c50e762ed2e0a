drm/i915: Remove some post-commit members from intel_crtc->atomic, v3.

fb_bits is useful to have in the crtc_state for cs flips when
the code is updated to use intel_frontbuffer_flip_prepare/complete.
So calculate it in advance and move it to crtc_state. The other stuff
can be calculated in post_plane_update, and aren't useful elsewhere.

Changes since v1:
- Changing wording, remove comment about loop.
Changes since v2:
- Rebase.
