staging: lustre: ldlm: refine LU-2665 patch for POSIX compliance

Follow-on to patch introduced to fix LU-2665 ticket (Gerrit
Change at http://review.whamcloud.com/6415 with Change-Id:
I8faa331712abeadee46eabe111ee1c23a05840d5).
Original patch introduced regressions against POSIX test suite
(fcntl.18/fcntl.35 tests in LSB-VSX POSIX test suite at
http://www.opengroup.org/testing/linux-test/lsb-vsx.html),
so the idea is to only resend F_UNLCKs to have both LU-2665 bug
and POSIX test suite happy.
