serial: 8250_mid: correct comment regarding Tangier HSU

On Intel Penwell and Tangier the HSU block (3 HSU ports) has a global register
set which is currently not used by the driver. On Tangier it has it's own PCI
device and thus available for enumeration. Since it's not a real HSU port we
just skip it and therefore put a comment in the code why we do so.
