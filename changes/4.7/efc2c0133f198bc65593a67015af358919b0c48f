iio: core: Add devm_ APIs for iio_channel_{get,release}_all

Some of kernel driver uses the IIO framework to get the sensor
value via ADC or IIO HW driver. The client driver get iio channel
by iio_channel_get_all() and release it by calling
iio_channel_release_all().

Add resource managed version (devm_*) of these APIs so that if client
calls the devm_iio_channel_get_all() then it need not to release it
explicitly, it can be done by managed device framework when driver
get un-binded.

This reduces the code in error path and also need of .remove callback in
some cases.
