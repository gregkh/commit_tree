ceph: don't call truncate_pagecache in ceph_writepages_start

truncate_pagecache() may decrease inode's reference. This can cause
deadlock if inode's last reference is dropped and iput_final() wants
to evict the inode. (evict() calls inode_wait_for_writeback(), which
waits for ceph_writepages_start() to return).

The fix is use work thead to truncate dirty pages. Also add 'forced
umount' check to ceph_update_writeable_page(), which prevents new
pages getting dirty.
