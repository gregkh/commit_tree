qed: Allow more than 16 VFs

In multi-function modes, PFs are currently limited to using 16 VFs -
But that limitation would also currently apply in case there's a single
PCI function exposed, where no such restriction should have existed.

This lifts the restriction for the default mode; User should be able
to start the maximum number of VFs as appear in the PCI config space.
