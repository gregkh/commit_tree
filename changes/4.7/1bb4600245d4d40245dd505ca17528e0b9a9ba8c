ncr5380: Disable the DMA errata workaround flag by default

The only chip that needs the workarounds enabled is an early NMOS
device. That means that the common case is to disable them.

Unfortunately the sense of the flag is such that it has to be set
for the common case.

Rename the flag so that zero can be used to mean "no errata workarounds
needed". This simplifies the code.
