drm/vc4: Fix get_vblank_counter with proper no-op for Linux 4.4+

get_vblank_counter hooked up to drm_vblank_count() which alway was
non-sensical but didn't hurt in the past. Since Linux 4.4 it
triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE in drm_update_vblank_count on first vblank
irq disable, so fix it by hooking to drm_vblank_no_hw_counter().

Tested against Raspian kernel 4.4.8 tree on RPi 2B.
