net: l2tp: Make l2tp_ip6 namespace aware

l2tp_ip6 tunnel and session lookups were still using init_net, although
the l2tp core infrastructure already supports lookups keyed by 'net'.

As a result, l2tp_ip6_recv discarded packets for tunnels/sessions
created in namespaces other than the init_net.

Fix, by using dev_net(skb->dev) or sock_net(sk) where appropriate.
