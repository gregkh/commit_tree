platform/chrome: cros_ec_lightbar - use name instead of ID to hide lightbar attributes

Lightbar attributes are hidden if the ID of the device is not 0 (the
assumption being that 0 = cros_ec = might have a lightbar, 1 = cros_pd =
hide); however, sometimes these devices get IDs 1 and 2 (or something
else) instead of IDs 0 and 1. This prevents the lightbar attributes from
appearing when they should.

Proposed change is to instead check whether the name assigned to the
device is CROS_EC_DEV_NAME (true for cros_ec, false for cros_pd).
