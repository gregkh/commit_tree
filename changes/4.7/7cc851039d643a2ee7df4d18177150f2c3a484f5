powerpc/pseries: Add POWER8NVL support to ibm,client-architecture-support call

If we do not provide the PVR for POWER8NVL, a guest on this system
currently ends up in PowerISA 2.06 compatibility mode on KVM, since QEMU
does not provide a generic PowerISA 2.07 mode yet. So some new
instructions from POWER8 (like "mtvsrd") get disabled for the guest,
resulting in crashes when using code compiled explicitly for
POWER8 (e.g. with the "-mcpu=power8" option of GCC).
