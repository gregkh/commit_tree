mm: use early_pfn_to_nid in page_ext_init

page_ext_init() checks suitable pages with pfn_to_nid(), but
pfn_to_nid() depends on memmap which will not be setup fully until
page_alloc_init_late() is done.  Use early_pfn_to_nid() instead of
pfn_to_nid() so that page extension could be still used early even
though CONFIG_ DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT is enabled and catch early page
allocation call sites.

Suggested by Joonsoo Kim [1], this fix basically undoes the change
introduced by commit b8f1a75d61d840 ("mm: call page_ext_init() after all
struct pages are initialized") and fixes the same problem with a better
approach.
