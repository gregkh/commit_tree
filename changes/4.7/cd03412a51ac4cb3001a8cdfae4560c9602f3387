libnvdimm, dax: introduce device-dax infrastructure

Device DAX is the device-centric analogue of Filesystem DAX
(CONFIG_FS_DAX).  It allows persistent memory ranges to be allocated and
mapped without need of an intervening file system.  This initial
infrastructure arranges for a libnvdimm pfn-device to be represented as
a different device-type so that it can be attached to a driver other
than the pmem driver.
