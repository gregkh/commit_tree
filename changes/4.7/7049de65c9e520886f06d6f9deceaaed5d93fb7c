IB/hfi1: Fix hard lockup due to not using save/restore spin lock

Commit b9b06cb6feda
("IB/hfi1: Fix missing lock/unlock in verbs drain callback")
added a spin lock.

Unfortunately, the new lock code can be called from a base
level interrupt state, and an interrupt that can get stacked
will attempt to get the same lock.

Fix by using the flag save/restore spin lock variation.
