drm: hdlcd: Revamp runtime power management

Because the HDLCD driver acts as a component master it can end
up enabling the runtime PM functionality before the encoders
are initialised. This can cause crashes if the component slave
never probes (missing module) or if the PM operations kick in
before the probe finishes.

Move the enabling of the runtime PM after the component master
has finished collecting the slave components and use the DRM
atomic helpers to suspend and resume the device.
