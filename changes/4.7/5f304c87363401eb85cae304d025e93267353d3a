drm/i915/kbl: Reset secondary power well requests left on by DMC/KVMR

The workaround added in
commit c6782b76d31a ("drm/i915/gen9: Reset secondary power well
requests left on by DMC/KVMR")
needs to be applied on Kabylake too as shown by the corresponding
timeout errors about power well 1 and MISC IO power well disabling in
the latest CI run.
