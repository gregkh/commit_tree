PM / Runtime: Fix error path in pm_runtime_force_resume()

As pm_runtime_set_active() may fail because the device's parent isn't
active, we can end up executing the ->runtime_resume() callback for the
device when it isn't allowed.

Fix this by invoking pm_runtime_set_active() before running the callback
and let's also deal with the error code.
