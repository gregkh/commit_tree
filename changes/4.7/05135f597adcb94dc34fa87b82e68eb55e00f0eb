btrfs: switch to common message helpers in open_ctree, adjust messages

Currently we lack the identification of the filesystem in most if not
all mount messages, done via printk/pr_* functions. We can use the
btrfs_* helpers in open_ctree, as the fs_info <-> sb link is established
at the beginning of the function.

The messages have been updated at the same time to be more consistent:

* dropped sb->s_id, as it's not available via btrfs_*
* added %d for return code where appropriate
* wording changed
* %Lx replaced by %llx
