net/sched: Enable netdev drivers to update statistics of offloaded actions

Introduce stats_update callback. netdev driver could call it for offloaded
actions to update the basic statistics (packets, bytes and last use).
Since bstats_update() and bstats_cpu_update() use skb as an argument to
get the counters, _bstats_update() and _bstats_cpu_update(), that get
bytes and packets as arguments, were added.
