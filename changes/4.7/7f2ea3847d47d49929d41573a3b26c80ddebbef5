dt-bindings: clk: sun5i: add DRAM gates compatible

The Allwinner SoCs have a gate controller to gate the access to the DRAM
clock to the some devices that need to access the DRAM directly (mostly
display / image related IPs).

Use a simple gates driver to support the one found in the A13 / R8 SoCs.
