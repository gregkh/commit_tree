net/mlx5e: Fix select queue callback

The default fallback function used by mlx5e select queue can return
any TX queues in range [0..dev->num_real_tx_queues).

The current implementation assumes that the fallback function returns
a number in the range [0.. number of channels).  Actually
dev->num_real_tx_queues = (number of channels) * dev->num_tc;
which is more than the expected range if num_tc is configured and could
lead to crashes.

To fix this we test if num_tc is not configured we can safely return the
fallback suggestion, if not we will reciprocal_scale the fallback
result and normalize it to the desired range.
