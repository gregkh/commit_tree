lib/mpi: mpi_read_buffer(): fix buffer overflow

Currently, mpi_read_buffer() writes full limbs to the output buffer
and moves memory around to purge leading zero limbs afterwards.

However, with

  commit 9cbe21d8f89d ("lib/mpi: only require buffers as big as needed for
                        the integer")

the caller is only required to provide a buffer large enough to hold the
result without the leading zeros.

This might result in a buffer overflow for small MP numbers with leading
zeros.

Fix this by coping the result to its final destination within the output
buffer and not copying the leading zeros at all.

                      the integer")
