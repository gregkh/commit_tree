perf tools: Add support for skipping itrace instructions

When using 'perf script' to look at PT traces it is often useful to
ignore the initialization code at the beginning.

On larger traces which may have many millions of instructions in
initialization code doing that in a pipeline can be very slow, with perf
script spending a lot of CPU time calling printf and writing data.

This patch adds an extension to the --itrace argument that skips 'n'
events (instructions, branches or transactions) at the beginning. This
is much more efficient.

v2:
Add support for BTS (Adrian Hunter)
Document in itrace.txt
Fix branch check
Check transactions and instructions too

Committer note:

To test intel_pt one needs to make sure VT-x isn't active, i.e.
stopping KVM guests on the test machine, as described by Andi Kleen
