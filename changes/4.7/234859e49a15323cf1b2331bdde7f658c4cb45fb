MIPS: Flush highmem pages in __flush_dcache_page

When flush_dcache_page is called on an executable page, that page is
about to be provided to userland & we can presume that the icache
contains no valid entries for its address range. However if the icache
does not fill from the dcache then we cannot presume that the pages
content has been written back as far as the memories that the dcache
will fill from (ie. L2 or further out).

This was being done for lowmem pages, but not for highmem which can lead
to icache corruption. Fix this by mapping highmem pages & flushing their
content from the dcache in __flush_dcache_page before providing the page
to userland, just as is done for lowmem pages.
