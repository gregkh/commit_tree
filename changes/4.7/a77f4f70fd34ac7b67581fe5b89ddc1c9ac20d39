of: of_mdio: Check if MDIO bus controller is available

Add a check whether the 'struct device_node' pointer passed to
of_mdiobus_register() is an available (aka enabled) node in the Device
Tree.

Rationale for doing this are cases where an Ethernet MAC provides a MDIO
bus controller and node, and an additional Ethernet MAC might be
connecting its PHY/switches to that first MDIO bus controller, while
still embedding one internally which is therefore marked as "disabled".

Instead of sprinkling checks like these in callers of
of_mdiobus_register(), do this in a central location.
