rose: limit sk_filter trim to payload

Sockets can have a filter program attached that drops or trims
incoming packets based on the filter program return value.

Rose requires data packets to have at least ROSE_MIN_LEN bytes. It
verifies this on arrival in rose_route_frame and unconditionally pulls
the bytes in rose_recvmsg. The filter can trim packets to below this
value in-between, causing pull to fail, leaving the partial header at
the time of skb_copy_datagram_msg.

Place a lower bound on the size to which sk_filter may trim packets
by introducing sk_filter_trim_cap and call this for rose packets.
