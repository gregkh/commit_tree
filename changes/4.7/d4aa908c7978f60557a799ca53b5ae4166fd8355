mmc: dw_mmc: rockchip: Set the drive phase properly

Historically for Rockchip devices we've relied on the power-on
default (or perhaps the firmware setting) to get the correct drive
phase for dw_mmc devices.  This worked OK for the most part, but:

* Relying on the setting just "being right" is a bit fragile.

* As soon as there is an instance where the power on default is wrong or
  where the firmware didn't configure this properly then we'll get a
  mysterious failure.

In commit 7a03fe6f48f3 ("clk: rockchip: reset init state before mmc card
initialization") we actually started setting this explicitly in the
kernel, but that commit wasn't quite right and also wasn't quite
enough.  See <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9085311/> for some
details.

Let's explicitly set this phase in dw_mmc.

The comments inside this patch try to explain the situation quite
throughly, but the high level overview of this is:

Before this patch on rk3288 devices tested (after revert of the clock
patch described above):
* eMMC: 180 degrees
* SDMMC/SDIO0/SDIO1: 90 degrees

After this patch:
* Use 90 degree phase offset usually.
* Use 180 degree phase offset for MMC_DDR52, SDR104, HS200.

That means we are _changing_ behavior for those devices in this way:

* If we have HS200 eMMC or DDR52 eMMC, we'll run ID mode at 90
  degrees (vs 180) but otherwise have no change.

* For any non-HS200 / non-DDR52 eMMC devices we'll now _always_ run at
  90 degrees (vs 180).  It seems fairly unlikely that building modern
  hardware is using an eMMC that isn't using DDR52 or HS200, of course.

* For SDR104 cards we'll now run with 180 degree phase offset (vs 90).
  It's expected that 90 degree phase offset would have worked OK, but
  this gives us extra margin.

I have tested this by inserting my collection of uSD cards (mostly UHS,
though a few not) into a veyron_minnie and confirmed that they still
seem to enumerate properly.  For a subset of them I tried putting a
filesystem on them and also tried running mmc_test.
