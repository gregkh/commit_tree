arm64: Add cpu_panic_kernel helper

During the activation of a secondary CPU, we could report serious
configuration issues and hence request to crash the kernel. We do
this for CPU ASID bit check now. We will need it also for handling
mismatched exception levels for the CPUs with VHE. Hence, add a
helper to do the same for reusability.
