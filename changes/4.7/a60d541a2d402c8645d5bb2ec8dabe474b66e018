usb: musb: sunxi: Set state to A_WAIT_VRISE when enabling Vbus

When the board is powering attached usb devices via the otg port
sometimes / on some devices it takes slightly too long for the Vbus
detection code in phy-sun4i-usb.c to signal that Vbus is high after
enabling Vbus and the musb hardware signals a MUSB_INTR_VBUSERROR
interrupt.

This commit sets the otg state to A_WAIT_VRISE upon enabling Vbus
making musb_stage0_irq() ignore the first VBUSERR_RETRY_COUNT
VBUSERROR interrupts, fixing connection issues in these cases.
