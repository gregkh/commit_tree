NVMe: Short-cut removal on surprise hot-unplug

This patch adds a new state that when set has the core automatically
kill request queues prior to removing namespaces.

If PCI device is not present at the time the nvme driver's remove is
called, we can kill all IO queues immediately instead of waiting for
the watchdog thread to do that at its polling interval. This improves
scenarios where multiple hot plug events occur at the same time since
it doesn't block the pci enumeration for as long.
