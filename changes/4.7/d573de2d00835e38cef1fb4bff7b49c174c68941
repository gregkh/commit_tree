drm/amdgpu: create fence slab once when amdgpu module init.

This avoids problems with multiple GPUs.  For example,
if the first GPU failed before amdgpu_fence_init() was
called, amdgpu_fence_slab_ref is still 0 and it will
get decremented in amdgpu_fence_driver_fini().  This
will lead to a crash during init of the second GPU since
amdgpu_fence_slab_ref is not 0.

v2: add functions for init/exit instead of
    moving the variables into the driver.
