ncr5380: Remove FLAG_NO_PSEUDO_DMA where possible

Drivers that define PSEUDO_DMA also define NCR5380_dma_xfer_len.
The core driver must call NCR5380_dma_xfer_len which means
FLAG_NO_PSEUDO_DMA can be eradicated from the core driver.

dmx3191d doesn't define PSEUDO_DMA and has no use for FLAG_NO_PSEUDO_DMA,
so remove it there also.
