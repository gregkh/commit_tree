IB/hfi1: Improve performance of interval RB trees

The interval RB tree management functions use handlers to
store user-specific callback for the various tree operations.
These handlers are put on a doubly-linked list. When a RB
tree function is called, the list is searched for the handler
of the particular tree.

The list which holds the handlers is modified very rarely - when
a handler is created and when a handler is removed. On the other
hand, it is searched very often. This a perfect usage scenario
for RCU.

The result is a much lower overhead of traversing the list as most
of the time no locking will be required.
