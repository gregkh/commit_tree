vsock: make listener child lock ordering explicit

There are several places where the listener and pending or accept queue
child sockets are accessed at the same time.  Lockdep is unhappy that
two locks from the same class are held.

Tell lockdep that it is safe and document the lock ordering.

Originally Claudio Imbrenda <imbrenda@linux.vnet.ibm.com> sent a similar
patch asking whether this is safe.  I have audited the code and also
covered the vsock_pending_work() function.
