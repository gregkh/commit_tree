coresight: tmc: splitting driver in ETB/ETF and ETR components

The TMC block can operate in 3 modes (ETB, ETF and ETR) and accessed
via two interfaces (sysFS and Perf).  That makes 6 mode to cover, which
is way too much coupling for a single file.

This patch splits the original TMC driver in 2 halves, one for ETB/ETF
and another one for ETR mode.  A common core is kept for functionality
common to all 3 modes.
