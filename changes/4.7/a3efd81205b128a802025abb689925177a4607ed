netfilter: conntrack: move generation seqcnt out of netns_ct

We only allow rehash in init namespace, so we only use
init_ns.generation.  And even if we would allow it, it makes no sense
as the conntrack locks are global; any ongoing rehash prevents insert/
delete.

So make this private to nf_conntrack_core instead.
