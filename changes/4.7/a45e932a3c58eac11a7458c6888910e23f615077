batman-adv: Avoid nullptr derefence in batadv_v_neigh_is_sob

batadv_neigh_ifinfo_get can return NULL when it cannot find (even when only
temporarily) anymore the neigh_ifinfo in the list neigh->ifinfo_list. This
has to be checked to avoid kernel Oopses when the ifinfo is dereferenced.

This a situation which isn't expected but is already handled by functions
like batadv_v_neigh_cmp. The same kind of warning is therefore used before
the function returns without dereferencing the pointers.
