IB/mlx4: Verify port number in flow steering create flow

In procedure mlx4_ib_create_flow, passing an invalid port number
will cause an out-of-bounds array access. Data passed to this procedure
can come from user-space.  Therefore, need to validate port number
before proceeding onwards.

Note that we check against the number of physical ports declared at
the verbs (ib core) level; When bonding is active, the verbs level
sees one physical port, even though the low-level driver sees two ports.
