xen-pciback: return proper values during BAR sizing

Reads following writes with all address bits set to 1 should return all
changeable address bits as one, not the BAR size (nor, as was the case
for the upper half of 64-bit BARs, the high half of the region's end
address). Presumably this didn't cause any problems so far because
consumers use the value to calculate the size (usually via val & -val),
and do nothing else with it.

But also consider the exception here: Unimplemented BARs should always
return all zeroes.

And finally, the check for whether to return the sizing address on read
for the ROM BAR should ignore all non-address bits, not just the ROM
Enable one.
