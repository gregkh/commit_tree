w1: add ability to set (SRAM) and store (EEPROM) configuration for temp sensors like DS18B20

Since many temperature sensors come "preconfigured" with a lower
precision, people are stuck at that precision when running on a kernel
based device (unlike the Dallas 1Wire library for e.g. Arduino, which
supports writing the configuration/scratchpad). This patch adds write
support for the scratchpad/precision registers via w1_slave sysfs.
