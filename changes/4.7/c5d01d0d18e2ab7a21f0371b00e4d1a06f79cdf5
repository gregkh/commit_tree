mm, compaction: simplify __alloc_pages_direct_compact feedback interface

__alloc_pages_direct_compact communicates potential back off by two
variables:
	- deferred_compaction tells that the compaction returned
	  COMPACT_DEFERRED
	- contended_compaction is set when there is a contention on
	  zone->lock resp. zone->lru_lock locks

__alloc_pages_slowpath then backs of for THP allocation requests to
prevent from long stalls. This is rather messy and it would be much
cleaner to return a single compact result value and hide all the nasty
details into __alloc_pages_direct_compact.

This patch shouldn't introduce any functional changes.
