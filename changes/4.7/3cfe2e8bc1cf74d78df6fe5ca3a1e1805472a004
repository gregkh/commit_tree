locking/Documentation: Clarify that ACQUIRE applies to loads, RELEASE applies to stores

For compound atomics performing both a load and a store operation, make
it clear that _acquire and _release variants refer only to the load and
store portions of compound atomic. For example, xchg_acquire is an xchg
operation where the load takes on ACQUIRE semantics.
