gre: remove superfluous pskb_may_pull

The call to gre_parse_header is either followed by iptunnel_pull_header, or
in the case of ICMP error path, the actual header is not accessed at all.

In the first case, iptunnel_pull_header will call pskb_may_pull anyway and
it's pointless to do it twice. The only difference is what call will fail
with what error code but the net effect is still the same in all call sites.

In the second case, pskb_may_pull is pointless, as skb->data is at the outer
IP header and not at the GRE header.
