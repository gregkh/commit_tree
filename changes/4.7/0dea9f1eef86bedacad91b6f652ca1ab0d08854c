checkpatch: reduce number of `git log` calls with --git

checkpatch currently calls git log multiple times to first get the
<revision range> sha1 values and again to get the subject for each
individual sha1 commit.

Always get the sha1 and subject at the same time instead.  Store the
subject in a sha1 hash to avoid the second git log exec.
