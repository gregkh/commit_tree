f2fs: fix to convert inline directory correctly

With below serials, we will lose parts of dirents:

1) mount f2fs with inline_dentry option
2) echo 1 > /sys/fs/f2fs/sdX/dir_level
3) mkdir dir
4) touch 180 files named [1-180] in dir
5) touch 181 in dir
6) echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
7) ll dir

ls: cannot access 2: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 4: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 5: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 6: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 8: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 9: No such file or directory

The reason is: when doing the inline dir conversion, we didn't consider
that directory has hierarchical hash structure which can be configured
through sysfs interface 'dir_level'.

By default, dir_level of directory inode is 0, it means we have one bucket
in hash table located in first level, all dirents will be hashed in this
bucket, so it has no problem for us to do the duplication simply between
inline dentry page and converted normal dentry page.

However, if we configured dir_level with the value N (greater than 0), it
will expand the bucket number of first level hash table by 2^N - 1, it
hashs dirents into different buckets according their hash value, if we
still move all dirents to first bucket, it makes incorrent locating for
inline dirents, the result is, although we can iterate all dirents through
->readdir, we can't stat some of them in ->lookup which based on hash
table searching.

This patch fixes this issue by rehashing dirents into correct position
when converting inline directory.
