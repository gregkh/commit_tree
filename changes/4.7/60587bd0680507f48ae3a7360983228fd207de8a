[media] cx23885: uninitialized variable in cx23885_av_work_handler()

The "handled" variable could be uninitialized if the
interrupt_service_routine() call back hasn't been implimented or if it
has been implemented but doesn't initialize "handled" to zero at the
start.  For example, adv76xx_isr() only sets "handled" to true.
