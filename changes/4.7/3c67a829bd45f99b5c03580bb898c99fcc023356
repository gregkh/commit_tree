cpufreq: pcc-cpufreq: Fix doorbell.access_width

Commit 920de6ebfab8 (ACPICA: Hardware: Enhance
acpi_hw_validate_register() with access_width/bit_offset awareness)
apparently exposed a latent bug, doorbell.access_width is initialized
to 64, but per Lv Zheng, it should be 4, and indeed, making that
change does bring pcc-cpufreq back to life.
