drm/i915: Clear VLV_IIR after PIPESTAT

On VLV/CHV VLV_IIR is not double double buffered, and it doesn't detect
edges from PIPESTAT & co. like it does on gen4. Instead it just
directly latches the level from PIPESTAT & co. That means we must clear
VLV_IIR after PIPESTAT & co. or else we'll get a spurious bit in VLV_IIR
every single time.
