ACPI / PM: Introduce efi poweroff for HW-full platforms without _S5

The problem is Linux registers pm_power_off = efi_power_off only if
we are in hardware reduced mode. Actually, what we also want is to do
this when ACPI S5 is simply not supported on non-legacy platforms.
Since some future Intel platforms are HW-full mode where the DSDT
fails to supply an _S5 object(without SLP_TYP), we should let such
kind of platform to leverage efi runtime service to poweroff.

This patch uses efi power off as first choice when S5 is unavailable,
even if there is a customized poweroff(driver provided, eg).
Meanwhile, the legacy platforms will not be affected because there is
no path for them to overwrite the pm_power_off to efi power off.
