bonding: set carrier off for devices created through netlink

Commit e826eafa65c6 ("bonding: Call netif_carrier_off after
register_netdevice") moved netif_carrier_off() from bond_init() to
bond_create(), but the latter is called only for initial default
devices and ones created through sysfs:

 $ modprobe bonding
 $ echo +bond1 > /sys/class/net/bonding_masters
 $ ip link add bond2 type bond
 $ grep "MII Status" /proc/net/bonding/*
 /proc/net/bonding/bond0:MII Status: down
 /proc/net/bonding/bond1:MII Status: down
 /proc/net/bonding/bond2:MII Status: up

Ensure that carrier is initially off also for devices created through
netlink.
