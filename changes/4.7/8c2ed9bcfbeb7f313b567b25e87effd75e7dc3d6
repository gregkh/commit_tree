arm: Add Aspeed machine

Aspeed devices are a common Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)
system on chip containing an ARM9 or ARM11 core, off-chip DDR RAM and
support for a large number of peripherals.

This patch adds basic support for the ast2400 and ast2500 machines,
capable of booting to a prompt in QEMU (-M palmetto-bmc), on an
Palmetto OpenPower development machine, and on the ast2500 EVB.
