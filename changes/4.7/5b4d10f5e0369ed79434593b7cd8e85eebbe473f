qlcnic: use the correct ring in qlcnic_83xx_process_rcv_ring_diag()

There is a static checker warning here "warn: mask and shift to zero"
and the code sets "ring" to zero every time.  From looking at how
QLCNIC_FETCH_RING_ID() is used in qlcnic_83xx_process_rcv_ring() the
qlcnic_83xx_hndl() should be removed.
