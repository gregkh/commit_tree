x86/asm/entry/32: Simplify pushes of zeroed pt_regs->REGs

Use of a temporary R8 register here seems to be unnecessary.

"push %r8" is a two-byte insn (it needs REX prefix to specify R8),
"push $0" is two-byte too. It seems just using the latter would be
no worse.

Thus, code had an unnecessary "xorq %r8,%r8" insn.
It probably costs nothing in execution time here since we are probably
limited by store bandwidth at this point, but still.

Run-tested under QEMU: 32-bit calls still work:

 / # ./test_syscall_vdso32
