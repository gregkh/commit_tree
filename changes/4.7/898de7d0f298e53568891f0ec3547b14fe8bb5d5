KEYS: user_update should use copy of payload made during preparsing

The payload preparsing routine for user keys makes a copy of the payload
provided by the caller and stashes it in the key_preparsed_payload struct for
->instantiate() or ->update() to use.  However, ->update() takes another copy
of this to attach to the keyring.  ->update() should be using this directly
and clearing the pointer in the preparse data.
