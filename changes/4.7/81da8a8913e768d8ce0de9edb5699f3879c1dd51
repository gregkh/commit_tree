staging: iio: accel: adis16204: Fix 'line over 80 characters' warning

Many of the comments in the same lines with #define
caused checkpatch warning 'line over 80 characters'.

Move all such comments to line before #define.
This style is already used in some other .h files in accel:

Add blank lines after #define to improve readability.
