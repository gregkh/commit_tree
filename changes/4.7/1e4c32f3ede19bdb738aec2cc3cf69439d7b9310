fm10k: prevent RCU issues during AER events

During an AER action response, we were calling fm10k_close without
holding the rtnl_lock() which could lead to possible RCU warnings being
produced due to 64bit stat updates among other causes. Similarly, we
need rtnl_lock() around fm10k_open during fm10k_io_resume. Follow the
same pattern elsewhere in the driver and protect the entire open/close
sequence.
