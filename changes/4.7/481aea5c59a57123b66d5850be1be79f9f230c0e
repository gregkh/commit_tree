checkpatch: whine about ACCESS_ONCE

Add a test for use of ACCESS_ONCE that could be written using READ_ONCE or
WRITE_ONCE.

--fix it too if desired.

The WRITE_ONCE fixes are less correct than the coccinelle script below as
checkpatch cannot have a completely correct "expression" mechanism because
checkpatch works on patches and not complete files.

$ cat access_once.cocci
@@
expression e1;
expression e2;
@@

-       ACCESS_ONCE(e1) = e2
+       WRITE_ONCE(e1, e2)

@@
expression e1;
@@

-       ACCESS_ONCE(e1)
+       READ_ONCE(e1)
