drivers: of: add definition of early_init_dt_alloc_reserved_memory_arch

The function early_init_dt_alloc_reserved_memory_arch is defined
in drivers/of/of_reserved_mem.c but is not declared in any of the
header files. Add the declaration of this to avoid the warning:

drivers/of/of_reserved_mem.c:31:19: warning: symbol 'early_init_dt_alloc_reserved_memory_arch' was not declared. Should it be static?
