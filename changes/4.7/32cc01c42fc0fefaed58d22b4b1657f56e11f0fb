staging: lustre: llite: error setting max_cache_mb at mount time

The root cause is that when max_cache_mb conf parameter is applied,
the client isn't connected to the OST yet so that sbi->ll_dt_exp is
NULL. However, it's not necessary to shrink the cache memory in this
case so success should be returned.
