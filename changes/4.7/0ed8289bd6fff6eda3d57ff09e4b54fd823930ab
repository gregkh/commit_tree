[media] smipcie: add support for TechnoTrend S2-4200 Twin

Add support for TechnoTrend TT-budget S2-4200 Twin DVB-S2 tuner. The
device seems to be rather similar to DVBSky S952 V3. This is a PCIe
card with 2 tuners. SMI PCIe bridge is used and the card has two
Montage M88RS6000 demod/tuners.

The M88RS6000 demod/tuner package needs firmware. You can download
one here:
