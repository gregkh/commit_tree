tipc: let first message on link be a state message

According to the link FSM, a received traffic packet can take a link
from state ESTABLISHING to ESTABLISHED, but the link can still not be
fully set up in one atomic operation. This means that even if the the
very first packet on the link is a traffic packet with sequence number
1 (one), it has to be dropped and retransmitted.

This can be avoided if we let the mentioned packet be preceded by a
LINK_PROTOCOL/STATE message, which takes up the endpoint before the
arrival of the traffic.

We add this small feature in this commit.

This is a fully compatible change.
