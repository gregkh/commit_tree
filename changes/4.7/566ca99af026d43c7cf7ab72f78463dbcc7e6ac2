powerpc/mm/radix: Add dummy radix_enabled()

In this patch we add the radix Kconfig and conditional check.
radix_enabled() is written to always return 0 here. Once we have all
needed radix changes added, we will update this to an mmu_feature check.

We need to add this early so that we can get it all build in the early
stage.
