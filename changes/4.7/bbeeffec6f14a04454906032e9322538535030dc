MIPS: mm: Pass scratch register through to iPTE_SW

Rather than hardcode a scratch register for the XPA case in iPTE_SW,
pass one through from the work registers allocated by the caller. This
allows for the XPA path to function correctly regardless of the work
registers in use.

Without doing this there are cases (where KScratch registers are
unavailable) in which iPTE_SW will incorrectly clobber $1 despite it
already being in use for the PTE or PTE pointer.
