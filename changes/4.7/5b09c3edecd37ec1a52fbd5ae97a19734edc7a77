x86: remove pointless uaccess_32.h complexity

I'm looking at trying to possibly merge the 32-bit and 64-bit versions
of the x86 uaccess.h implementation, but first this needs to be cleaned
up.

For example, the 32-bit version of "__copy_to_user_inatomic()" is mostly
the special cases for the constant size, and it's actually never
relevant.  Every user except for one aren't actually using a constant
size anyway, and the one user that uses it is better off just using
__put_user() instead.

So get rid of the unnecessary complexity.

[ The same cleanup should likely happen to __copy_from_user_inatomic()
  as well, but that one has a lot more users that I need to take a look
  at first ]
