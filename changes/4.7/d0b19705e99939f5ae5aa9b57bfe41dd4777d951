libceph: async MON client generic requests

For map check, we are going to need to send CEPH_MSG_MON_GET_VERSION
messages asynchronously and get a callback on completion.  Refactor MON
client to allow firing off generic requests asynchronously and add an
async variant of ceph_monc_get_version().  ceph_monc_do_statfs() is
switched over and remains sync.
