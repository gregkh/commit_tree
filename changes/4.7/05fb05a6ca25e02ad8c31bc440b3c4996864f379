KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Removel harmful BUG_ON

When changing the active bit from an MMIO trap, we decide to
explode if the intid is that of a private interrupt.

This flawed logic comes from the fact that we were assuming that
kvm_vcpu_kick() as called by kvm_arm_halt_vcpu() would not return before
the called vcpu responded, but this is not the case, so we need to
perform this wait even for private interrupts.

Dropping the BUG_ON seems like the right thing to do.
