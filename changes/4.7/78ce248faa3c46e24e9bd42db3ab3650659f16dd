efi: Iterate over efi.memmap in for_each_efi_memory_desc()

Most of the users of for_each_efi_memory_desc() are equally happy
iterating over the EFI memory map in efi.memmap instead of 'memmap',
since the former is usually a pointer to the latter.

For those users that want to specify an EFI memory map other than
efi.memmap, that can be done using for_each_efi_memory_desc_in_map().
One such example is in the libstub code where the firmware is queried
directly for the memory map, it gets iterated over, and then freed.

This change goes part of the way toward deleting the global 'memmap'
variable, which is not universally available on all architectures
(notably IA64) and is rather poorly named.
