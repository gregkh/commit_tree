clk: Provide OF helper to mark clocks as CRITICAL

This call matches clocks which have been marked as critical in DT
and sets the appropriate flag.  These flags can then be used to
mark the clock core flags appropriately prior to registration.

Legacy bindings requiring this feature must add the clock-critical
property to their binding descriptions, as it is not a part of
common-clock binding.
