tty: Replace ASYNC_NORMAL_ACTIVE bit and update atomically

Replace ASYNC_NORMAL_ACTIVE bit in the tty_port::flags field with
TTY_PORT_ACTIVE bit in the tty_port::iflags field. Introduce helpers
tty_port_set_active() and tty_port_active() to abstract atomic bit ops.

Extract state changes from port lock sections, as this usage is
broken and confused; the state transitions are protected by the
tty lock (which mutually excludes parallel open/close/hangup),
and no user tests the active state while holding the port lock.
