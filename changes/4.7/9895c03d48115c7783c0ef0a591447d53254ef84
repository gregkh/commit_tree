kbuild: record needed exported symbols for modules

Kernel modules are partially linked object files with some undefined
symbols that are expected to be matched with EXPORT_SYMBOL() entries
from elsewhere.

Each .tmp_versions/*.mod file currently contains two line of text
separated by a newline character. The first line has the actual module
file name while the second line has a list of object files constituting
that module. Those files are parsed by modpost (scripts/mod/sumversion.c),
scripts/Makefile.modpost, scripts/Makefile.modsign, etc.  Only the
modpost utility cares about the second line while the others retrieve
only the first line.

Therefore we can add a third line to record the list of undefined symbols
aka required EXPORT_SYMBOL() entries for each module into that file
without breaking anything. Like for the second line, symbols are separated
by a blank and the list is terminated with a newline character.

To avoid needless build overhead, the undefined symbols extraction is
performed only when CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS is selected.
