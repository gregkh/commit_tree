radix-tree: introduce radix_tree_replace_clear_tags()

In addition to replacing the entry, we also clear all associated tags.
This is really a one-off special for page_cache_tree_delete() which had
far too much detailed knowledge about how the radix tree works.

For efficiency, factor node_tag_clear() out of radix_tree_tag_clear() It
can be used by radix_tree_delete_item() as well as
radix_tree_replace_clear_tags().
