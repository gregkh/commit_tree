MIPS: math-emu: Fix m{add,sub}.s shifts

The code in _sp_maddf (formerly ieee754sp_madd) appears to have been
copied verbatim from ieee754sp_add, and although it's adding the
unpacked "r" & "z" floats it kept using macros that operate on "x" &
"y". This led to the addition being carried out incorrectly on some
mismash of the product, accumulator & multiplicand fields. Typically
this would lead to the assertions "ze == re" & "ze <= SP_EMAX" failing
since ze & re hadn't been operated upon.
