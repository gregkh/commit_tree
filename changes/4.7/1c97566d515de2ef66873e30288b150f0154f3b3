samples/bpf: add a README file to get users started

Getting started with using examples in samples/bpf/ is not
straightforward.  There are several dependencies, and specific
versions of these dependencies.

Just compiling the example tool is also slightly obscure, e.g. one
need to call make like:

 make samples/bpf/

Do notice the "/" slash after the directory name.
