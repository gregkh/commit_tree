IB/mlx5: Fix post send fence logic

If the caller specified IB_SEND_FENCE in the send flags of the work
request and no previous work request stated that the successive one
should be fenced, the work request would be executed without a fence.
This could result in RDMA read or atomic operations failure due to a MR
being invalidated. Fix this by adding the mlx5 enumeration for fencing
RDMA/atomic operations and fix the logic to apply this.
