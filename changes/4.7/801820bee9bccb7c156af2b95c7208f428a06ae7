efi/arm/libstub: Make screen_info accessible to the UEFI stub

In order to hand over the framebuffer described by the GOP protocol and
discovered by the UEFI stub, make struct screen_info accessible by the
stub. This involves allocating a loader data buffer and passing it to the
kernel proper via a UEFI Configuration Table, since the UEFI stub executes
in the context of the decompressor, and cannot access the kernel's copy of
struct screen_info directly.
