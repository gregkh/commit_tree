ARM: imx: always use TWD on IMX6Q

There is no reason to limit the TWD to be used on SMP kernels only if the
hardware has it available.
On Wandboard i.MX6SOLO, running PREEMPT-RT and cyclictest I see as max
immediately after start in idle:
UP : ~90us
SMP: ~50us
UP + TWD: ~20us.
Based on this numbers I prefer the TWD over the slightly slower MXC
timer.
