libnvdimm, pfn, dax: fix initialization vs autodetect for mode + alignment

The updated ndctl unit tests discovered that if a pfn configuration with
a 4K alignment is read from the namespace, that alignment will be
ignored in favor of the default 2M alignment.  The result is that the
configuration will fail initialization with a message like:

    dax6.1: bad offset: 0x22000 dax disabled align: 0x200000

Fix this by allowing the alignment read from the info block to override
the default which is 2M not 0 in the autodetect path.  This also fixes a
similar problem with the mode and alignment settings silently being
overwritten by the kernel when userspace has changed it.  We now will
either overwrite the info block if userspace changes the uuid or fail
and warn if a live setting disagrees with the info block.
