lib/mpi: mpi_write_sgl(): fix style issue with lzero decrement

Within the copying loop in mpi_write_sgl(), we have

  if (lzeros > 0) {
    ...
    lzeros -= sizeof(alimb);
  }

However, at this point, lzeros < sizeof(alimb) holds. Make this fact
explicit by rewriting the above to

  if (lzeros) {
    ...
    lzeros = 0;
  }
