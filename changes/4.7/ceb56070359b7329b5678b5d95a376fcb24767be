bpf, perf: delay release of BPF prog after grace period

Commit dead9f29ddcc ("perf: Fix race in BPF program unregister") moved
destruction of BPF program from free_event_rcu() callback to __free_event(),
which is problematic if used with tail calls: if prog A is attached as
trace event directly, but at the same time present in a tail call map used
by another trace event program elsewhere, then we need to delay destruction
via RCU grace period since it can still be in use by the program doing the
tail call (the prog first needs to be dropped from the tail call map, then
trace event with prog A attached destroyed, so we get immediate destruction).
