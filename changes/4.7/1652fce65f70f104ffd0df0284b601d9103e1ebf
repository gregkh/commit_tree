drm/dp/mst: Restore primary hub guid on resume

Some hubs are forgetful, and end up forgetting whatever GUID we set
previously after we do a suspend/resume cycle. This can lead to
hotplugging breaking (along with probably other things) since the hub
will start sending connection notifications with the wrong GUID. As
such, we need to check on resume whether or not the GUID the hub is
giving us is valid.
