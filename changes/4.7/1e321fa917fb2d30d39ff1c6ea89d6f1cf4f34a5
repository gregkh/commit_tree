MIPS64: Support of at least 48 bits of SEGBITS

SEGBITS is 40 bits or more, depending on CPU type.  Introduces optional
support for 48 bits of application virtual address space.  Only 16K and
64K pages are supported.

Enabling will result in a memory overhead of a small number of pages for
small applications.  For 64K pages a 3rd level of page tables is required
which has some impact during software TLB refill.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Fixed things raised in the review of the version
posted and changed kconfig to be a bit more userfriendly.]
