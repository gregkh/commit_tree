ACPI / utils: Rename acpi_dev_present()

acpi_dev_present() was originally named after pci_dev_present()
to signify the similarity of the two functions.

However Rafael J. Wysocki pointed out that the exported function
acpi_dev_present() is easily confused with the non-exported
acpi_device_is_present(). Additionally in ACPI parlance the term
"present" usually refers to the "device is present" bit returned
by the _STA control method, yet acpi_dev_present() merely checks
presence in the namespace. It does not invoke _STA at all, let
alone check the "device is present" bit.

As suggested by Rafael, rename the function to acpi_dev_found()
and adjust all existing call sites.
