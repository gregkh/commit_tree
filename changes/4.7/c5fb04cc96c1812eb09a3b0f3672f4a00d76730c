ARM: socfpga: Initialize Arria10 OCRAM ECC on startup

Initialize ECC for Arria10 On-Chip RAM on machine startup. The OCRAM
memory must be initialized before data is stored in memory otherwise the
ECC will fail on reads. The previous check-in

  2364d423a7b3 ("ARM: socfpga: Enable Arria10 OCRAM ECC on startup")

added the OCRAM enable and initialization code but was not called on
startup.
