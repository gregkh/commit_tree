fou: fix IPv6 Kconfig options

The Kconfig options I added to work around broken compilation ended
up screwing up things more, as I used the wrong symbol to control
compilation of the file, resulting in IPv6 fou support to never be built
into the kernel.

Changing CONFIG_NET_FOU_IPV6_TUNNELS to CONFIG_IPV6_FOU fixes that
problem, I had renamed the symbol in one location but not the other,
and as the file is never being used by other kernel code, this did not
lead to a build failure that I would have caught.

After that fix, another issue with the same patch becomes obvious, as we
'select INET6_TUNNEL', which is related to IPV6_TUNNEL, but not the same,
and this can still cause the original build failure when IPV6_TUNNEL is
not built-in but IPV6_FOU is. The fix is equally trivial, we just need
to select the right symbol.

I have successfully build 350 randconfig kernels with this patch
and verified that the driver is now being built.
