wlcore/wl12xx: Fix fw logger over sdio

The commit fb724ed5c617 ("wlcore: Fix regression in
wlcore_set_partition()") fixed wl12xx functionality.
However, it reverted the support in fw logger
over sdio in wl18xx.

This patch reverts the changes made and also fixes
the original functionality issue introduced in wl12xx.
