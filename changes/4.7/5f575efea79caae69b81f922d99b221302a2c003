crypto: lzo - get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

lzo_init uses __GFP_REPEAT to allocate LZO1X_MEM_COMPRESS 16K. This is
order 3 allocation request and __GFP_REPEAT is ignored for this size
as well as all <= PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
