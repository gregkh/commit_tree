x86/arch_prctl: Fix ARCH_GET_FS and ARCH_GET_GS

ARCH_GET_FS and ARCH_GET_GS attempted to figure out the fsbase and
gsbase respectively from saved thread state.  This was wrong: fsbase
and gsbase live in registers while a thread is running, not in
memory.

For reasons I can't fathom, the fsbase and gsbase code were
different.  Since neither was correct, I didn't try to figure out
what the point of the difference was.

Change it to simply read the MSRs.

The code for reading the base for a remote thread is also completely
wrong if the target thread uses its own descriptors (which is the case
for all 32-bit threaded programs), but fixing that is a different
story.
