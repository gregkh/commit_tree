vmstat: get rid of the ugly cpu_stat_off variable

The cpu_stat_off variable is unecessary since we can check if a
workqueue request is pending otherwise.  Removal of cpu_stat_off makes
it pretty easy for the vmstat shepherd to ensure that the proper things
happen.

Removing the state also removes all races related to it.  Should a
workqueue not be scheduled as needed for vmstat_update then the shepherd
will notice and schedule it as needed.  Should a workqueue be
unecessarily scheduled then the vmstat updater will disable it.
