leds: gpio: Support the "panic-indicator" firmware property

Calling a GPIO LEDs is quite likely to work even if the kernel
has paniced, so they are ideal to blink in this situation.
This commit adds support for the new "panic-indicator"
firmware property, allowing to mark a given LED to blink on
a kernel panic.
