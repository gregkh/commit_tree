drm/radeon: fix asic initialization for virtualized environments

When executing in a PCI passthrough based virtuzliation environment, the
hypervisor will usually attempt to send a PCIe bus reset signal to the
ASIC when the VM reboots. In this scenario, the card is not correctly
initialized, but we still consider it to be posted. Therefore, in a
passthrough based environemnt we should always post the card to guarantee
it is in a good state for driver initialization.
