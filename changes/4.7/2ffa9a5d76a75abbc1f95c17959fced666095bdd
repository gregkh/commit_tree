thunderbolt: Fix double free of drom buffer

If tb_drom_read() fails, sw->drom is freed but not set to NULL.  sw->drom
is then freed again in the error path of tb_switch_alloc().

The bug can be triggered by unplugging a thunderbolt device shortly after
it is detected by the thunderbolt driver.

Clear sw->drom if tb_drom_read() fails.
