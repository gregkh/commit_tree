e1000e: e1000e_cyclecounter_read(): incvalue is 32 bits, not 64

"incvalue" variable holds a result of "er32(TIMINCA) &
E1000_TIMINCA_INCVALUE_MASK" and used in "do_div(temp, incvalue)"
as a divisor.

Thus, "u64 incvalue" declaration is probably a mistake.
Even though it seems to be a harmless one, let's fix it.
