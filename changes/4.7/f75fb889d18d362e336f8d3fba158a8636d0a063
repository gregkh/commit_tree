mm, page_alloc: avoid unnecessary zone lookups during pageblock operations

Pageblocks have an associated bitmap to store migrate types and whether
the pageblock should be skipped during compaction.  The bitmap may be
associated with a memory section or a zone but the zone is looked up
unconditionally.  The compiler should optimise this away automatically
so this is a cosmetic patch only in many cases.
