arm64: dts: register Hi6220's thermal zone for power allocator

With profiling Hi6220's power modeling so get dynamic coefficient and
sustainable power. So pass these parameters from DT.

Now enable power allocator with only one actor for CPU part, so directly
use cluster0's thermal sensor for monitoring temperature.
