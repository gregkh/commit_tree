KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Remove irq_phys_map from interface

Now that the virtual arch timer does not care about the irq_phys_map
anymore, let's rework kvm_vgic_map_phys_irq() to return an error
value instead. Any reference to that mapping can later be done by
passing the correct combination of VCPU and virtual IRQ number.
This makes the irq_phys_map handling completely private to the
VGIC code.
