PCI: Provide common functions for ECAM mapping

Add config option PCI_ECAM and file drivers/pci/ecam.c to provide generic
functions for accessing memory-mapped PCI config space.

The API is defined in drivers/pci/ecam.h and is written to replace the API
in drivers/pci/host/pci-host-common.h.  The file defines a new 'struct
pci_config_window' to hold the information related to a PCI config area and
its mapping.  This structure is expected to be used as sysdata for
controllers that have ECAM based mapping.

Helper functions are provided to setup the mapping, free the mapping and to
implement the map_bus method in 'struct pci_ops'
