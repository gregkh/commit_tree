hpsa: correct initialization order issue

The driver was calling scsi_scan_host before enabling interrupts.

This has gone unnoticed except for customers running in intx mode.
Calling scsi_scan_host before interrupts are enabled causes
"irq XX: nobody cared" messages and the driver to hang.

This patch enables interrupts before the call to scsi_scan_host.
