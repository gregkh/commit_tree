xfs: only return -errno or success from attr ->put_listent

Today, the put_listent formatters return either 1 or 0; if
they return 1, some callers treat this as an error and return
it up the stack, despite "1" not being a valid (negative)
error code.

The intent seems to be that if the input buffer is full,
we set seen_enough or set count = -1, and return 1;
but some callers check the return before checking the
seen_enough or count fields of the context.

Fix this by only returning non-zero for actual errors
encountered, and rely on the caller to first check the
return value, then check the values in the context to
decide what to do.
