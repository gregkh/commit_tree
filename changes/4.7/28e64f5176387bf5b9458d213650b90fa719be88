ALSA: firewire-tascam: drop reuse of incoming packet parameter for outgoing packet parameter

In packet streaming protocol applied to TASCAM FireWire series, the value
of SYT field in CIP header is always zero, therefore it has no meaning.
There's no need to synchronize packets in both direction for the series.

In current implementation of ALSA firewire stack, driver for the series
uses incoming packet parameter for outgoing packet parameter to calculate
the number of data blocks. This can be simplified because the task of
corresponding driver is to transfer data blocks enough to sampling transfer
frequency.

This commit purges support of full duplex synchronization to prevent
over-engineering implementation.
