ALSA: firewire-lib: compute the value of second field in cycle count for IR context

In callback function of isochronous context, modules can queue packets to
indicated isochronous cycles. Although the cycle to queue a packet is
deterministic by calculation, this module doesn't implement the calculation
because it's useless for processing.

In future, the cycle count is going to be printed with the other parameters
for debugging. This commit is the preparation. The cycle count is computed
by cycle unit, and correctly arranged to corresponding packets. The
calculated count is used in later commit.
