tracing: Remove restriction on string position in hist trigger keys

If we assume the maximum size for a string field, we don't have to
worry about its position.  Since we only allow two keys in a compound
key and having more than one string key in a given compound key
doesn't make much sense anyway, trading a bit of extra space instead
of introducing an arbitrary restriction makes more sense.

We also need to use the event field size for static strings when
copying the contents, otherwise we get random garbage in the key.

Also, cast string return values to avoid warnings on 32-bit compiles.

Finally, rearrange the code without changing any functionality by
moving the compound key updating code into a separate function.
