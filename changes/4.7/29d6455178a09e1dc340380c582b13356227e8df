sched: panic on corrupted stack end

Until now, hitting this BUG_ON caused a recursive oops (because oops
handling involves do_exit(), which calls into the scheduler, which in
turn raises an oops), which caused stuff below the stack to be
overwritten until a panic happened (e.g.  via an oops in interrupt
context, caused by the overwritten CPU index in the thread_info).

Just panic directly.
