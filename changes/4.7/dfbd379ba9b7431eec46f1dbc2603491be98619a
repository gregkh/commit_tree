gpio: of: Return error if gpio hog configuration failed

If GPIO hog configuration failed while adding OF based
gpiochip() then return the error instead of ignoring it.

This helps of properly handling the gpio driver dependency.

When adding the gpio hog nodes for NVIDIA's Tegra210 platforms,
the gpio_hogd() fails with EPROBE_DEFER because pinctrl is not
ready at this time and gpio_request() for Tegra GPIO driver
returns error. The error was not causing the Tegra GPIO driver
to fail as the error was getting ignored.
