score: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

pte_alloc_one{_kernel} allocate PTE_ORDER which is 0.  This means that
this flag has never been actually useful here because it has always been
used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
