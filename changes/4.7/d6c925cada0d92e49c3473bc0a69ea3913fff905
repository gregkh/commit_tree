drm/msm: Move call to PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO after reassignment

Here, a location is reset to NULL before being passed to PTR_ERR.
So, PTR_ERR should be called before its argument is reassigned
to NULL. Further to simplify things use PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO instead
of PTR_ERR and IS_ERR.

Problem found using Coccinelle.
