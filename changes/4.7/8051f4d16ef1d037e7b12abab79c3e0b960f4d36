arm64: report CPU number in bad_mode

If we take an exception we don't expect (e.g. SError), we report this in
the bad_mode handler with pr_crit. Depending on the configured log
level, we may or may not log additional information in functions called
subsequently. Notably, the messages in dump_stack (including the CPU
number) are printed with KERN_DEFAULT and may not appear.

Some exceptions have an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED ESR_ELx.ISS encoding, and
knowing the CPU number is crucial to correctly decode them. To ensure
that this is always possible, we should log the CPU number along with
the ESR_ELx value, so we are not reliant on subsequent logs or
additional printk configuration options.

This patch logs the CPU number in bad_mode such that it is possible for
a developer to decode these exceptions, provided access to sufficient
documentation.
