arm64: acpi: add acpi=on cmdline option to prefer ACPI boot over DT

If both ACPI and DT platform descriptions are available, and the
kernel was configured at build time to support both flavours, the
default policy is to prefer DT over ACPI, and preferring ACPI over
DT while still allowing DT as a fallback is not possible.

Since some enterprise features (such as RAS) depend on ACPI, it may
be desirable for, e.g., distro installers to prefer ACPI boot but
fall back to DT rather than failing completely if no ACPI tables are
available.

So introduce the 'acpi=on' kernel command line parameter for arm64,
which signifies that ACPI should be used if available, and DT should
only be used as a fallback.
