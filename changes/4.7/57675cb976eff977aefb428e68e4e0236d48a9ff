kernel/sysrq, watchdog, sched/core: Reset watchdog on all CPUs while processing sysrq-w

Lengthy output of sysrq-w may take a lot of time on slow serial console.

Currently we reset NMI-watchdog on the current CPU to avoid spurious
lockup messages. Sometimes this doesn't work since softlockup watchdog
might trigger on another CPU which is waiting for an IPI to proceed.
We reset softlockup watchdogs on all CPUs, but we do this only after
listing all tasks, and this may be too late on a busy system.

So, reset watchdogs CPUs earlier, in for_each_process_thread() loop.
