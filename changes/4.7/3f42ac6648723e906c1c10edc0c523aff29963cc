net/mlx5: E-Switch, Use the correct error check on returned pointers

The mlx5 flow-steering API (mlx5_create_flow_table/group/rule) never
returns null pointer on error. Even if it was doing that, checking
for IS_ERR_OR_NULL(p) and then returning PTR_ERR(p) would have cause
bugs, since PTR_ERR(NULL) --> success, crash.

To make things more robust and protect against related future bugs,
convert all IS_ERR_OR_NULL checks on returned values to IS_ERR.
