powerpc/mm/hash: Don't add memory coherence if cache inhibited is set

H_ENTER hcall handling in qemu had assumptions that a cache inhibited
hpte entry won't have memory conference set. Also older kernel
mentioned that some version of pHyp required this (the code removed
by the below commit says:

    /* Make pHyp happy */
    if ((rflags & _PAGE_NO_CACHE) && !(rflags & _PAGE_WRITETHRU))
            hpte_r &= ~HPTE_R_M;

But with older kernel we had some inconsistent memory conherence
mapping. We always enabled memory conherence in the page fault path and
removed memory conherence is _PAGE_NO_CACHE was set when we mapped the
page via htab_bolt_mapping. The commit mentioned below tried to
consolidate that by always enabling memory conherence. But as mentioned
above that breaks Qemu H_ENTER handling.

This patch update this such that we enable memory conherence only if
cache inhibited is not set and bring fault handling, lpar and bolt
mapping in sync.
