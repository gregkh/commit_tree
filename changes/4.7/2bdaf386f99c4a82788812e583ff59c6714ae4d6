mac80211: mesh: move path tables into if_mesh

The mesh path and mesh gate hashtables are global, containing
all of the mpaths for every mesh interface, but the paths are
all tied logically to a single interface.  The common case is
just a single mesh interface, so optimize for that by moving
the global hashtable into the per-interface struct.

Doing so allows us to drop sdata pointer comparisons inside
the lookups and also saves a few bytes of BSS and data.
