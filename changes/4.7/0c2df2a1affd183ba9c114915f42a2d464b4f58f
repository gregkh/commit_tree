KVM: Handle MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL

Intel CPUs having Turbo Boost feature implement an MSR to provide a
control interface via rdmsr/wrmsr instructions. One could detect the
presence of this feature by issuing one of these instructions and
handling the #GP exception which is generated in case the referenced MSR
is not implemented by the CPU.

KVM's vCPU model behaves exactly as a real CPU in this case by injecting
a fault when MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL is called (which KVM does not support).
However, some operating systems use this register during an early boot
stage in which their kernel is not capable of handling #GP correctly,
causing #DP and finally a triple fault effectively resetting the vCPU.

This patch implements a dummy handler for MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL to avoid the
crashes.
