KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add ACTIVE registers handlers

The active register handlers are shared between the v2 and v3
emulation, so their implementation goes into vgic-mmio.c, to be
easily referenced from the v3 emulation as well later.
Since activation/deactivation of an interrupt may happen entirely
in the guest without it ever exiting, we need some extra logic to
properly track the active state.
For clearing the active state, we basically have to halt the guest to
make sure this is properly propagated into the respective VCPUs.
