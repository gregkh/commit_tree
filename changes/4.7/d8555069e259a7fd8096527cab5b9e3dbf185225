staging: lustre: obd: cleanup client import if client_obd_setup fails

client_obd_setup() allocates an obd_import which should be cleaned up
if there is any failure afterwards in callers of client_obd_setup().
This patch fixes the bug in osc_setup(), mgc_setup(), mdc_setup() and
lwp_setup(). The fix is to call obd_cleanup_client_import() before
calling client_obd_cleanup() in case of an error.
