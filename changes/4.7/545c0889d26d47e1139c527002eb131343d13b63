xfs: simplify inode reclaim tagging interfaces

Inode radix tree tagging for reclaim passes a lot of unnecessary
variables around. Over time the xfs-perag has grown a xfs_mount
backpointer, and an internal agno so we don't need to pass other
variables into the tagging functions to supply this information.

Rework the functions to pass the minimal variable set required
and simplify the internal logic and flow.
