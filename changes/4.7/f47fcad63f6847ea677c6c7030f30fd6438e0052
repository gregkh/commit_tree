memory: omap-gpmc: Introduce GPMC to NAND interface

The OMAP GPMC module has certain registers dedicated for NAND
access and some NAND bits mixed with other GPMC functionality.

For the NAND dedicated registers we have the struct gpmc_nand_regs.

The NAND driver needs to access NAND specific bits from the
following non-dedicated registers
- EMPTYWRITEBUFFERSTATUS from GPMC_STATUS

For accessing these bits we introduce the struct gpmc_nand_ops.

Add gpmc_omap_get_nand_ops() that returns the gpmc_nand_ops along
with updating the gpmc_nand_regs. This API will be called by the
OMAP NAND driver to access the necessary bits in GPMC register space.
