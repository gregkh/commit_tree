radix-tree: tidy up next_chunk

Convert radix_tree_next_chunk to use 'child' instead of 'slot' as the
name of the child node.  Also use node_maxindex() where it makes sense.

The 'rnode' variable was unnecessary; it doesn't overlap in usage with
'node', so we can just use 'node' the whole way through the function.

Improve the testcase to start the walk from every index in the carefully
constructed tree, and to accept any index within the range covered by
the entry.
