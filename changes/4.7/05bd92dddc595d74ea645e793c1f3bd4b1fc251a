block: missing bio_put following submit_bio_wait

submit_bio_wait() gives the caller an opportunity to examine
struct bio and so expects the caller to issue the put_bio()

This fixes a memory leak reported by a few people in 4.7-rc2
kmemleak report after 9082e87bfbf8 ("block: remove struct bio_batch")
