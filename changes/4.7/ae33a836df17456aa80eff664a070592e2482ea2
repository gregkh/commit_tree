staging: lustre: llite: quiet overly verbose info message

The client doesn't need to print a message for every client mount that
the layout lock feature is enabled.  This can be found at runtime via
the "import" proc file.

I also noticed that deleting OST objects logs into the debug log with
D_HA status, which is enabled by default.  Move this over to D_INODE
so it doesn't fill the OST debug logs.
