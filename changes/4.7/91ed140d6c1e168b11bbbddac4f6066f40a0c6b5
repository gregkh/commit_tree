x86/asm: Make sure verify_cpu() has a good stack

04633df0c43d ("x86/cpu: Call verify_cpu() after having entered long mode too")
added the call to verify_cpu() for sanitizing CPU configuration.

The latter uses the stack minimally and it can happen that we land in
startup_64() directly from a 64-bit bootloader. Then we want to use our
own, known good stack.

Do that.

APs don't need this as the trampoline sets up a stack for them.
