MIPS: Octeon: detect and fix byte swapped initramfs

Octeon machines support running in little endian mode. U-Boot usually
runs in big endian-mode. Therefore the initramfs is loaded in big endian
mode, and the kernel later tries to access it in little endian mode.

This patch fixes that by detecting byte swapped initramfs using either the
CPIO header or the header from standard compression methods, and
byte swaps it if needed. It first checks that the header doesn't match
in the native endianness to avoid false detections. It uses the kernel
decompress library so that we don't have to maintain the list of magics
if some decompression methods are added to the kernel.
