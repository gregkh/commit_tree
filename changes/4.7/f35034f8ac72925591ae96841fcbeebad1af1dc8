drm/core: Fix ordering in drm_mode_config_cleanup.

__drm_atomic_helper_plane_destroy_state calls
drm_framebuffer_unreference, which means that if drm_framebuffer_free
is called before plane->destroy freed memory will be accessed.

A similar case happens for the blob list, which was freed before the
crtc state was, resulting in the unreference_blob from crtc_destroy_state
pointing to garbage memory causing another opportunity for a GPF.
