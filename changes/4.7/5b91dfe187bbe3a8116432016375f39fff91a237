usb: storage: scsiglue: limit USB3 devices to 2048 sectors

USB3 devices, because they are much newer, have much
less chance of having issues with larger transfers.

We still keep a limit because anything above 2048
sectors really rendered negligible speed
improvements, so we will simply ignore
that. Transferring 1MiB should already give us
pretty good performance.
