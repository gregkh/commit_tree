ACPI / EC: Fix code ordering issue in ec_remove_handlers()

There is an order issue in ec_remove_handlers() that acpi_ec_stop()
is called before removing the operation region handler. That is
incorrect, because the operation region handler removal triggers
_REG(DISCONNECT) which may result in new EC transactions to carry
out.

That existing issue has been triggered by the following commit:

    Commit: dcf15cbded656a12335bc4151f3f75f10080a375
    Subject: ACPI / EC: Fix a boot EC regresion by restoring boot EC

which changed the driver to call ec_remove_handlers() after invoking
_REG(CONNECT), so the issue has become visible.
