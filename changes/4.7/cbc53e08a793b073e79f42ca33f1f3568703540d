GSO: Add GSO type for fixed IPv4 ID

This patch adds support for TSO using IPv4 headers with a fixed IP ID
field.  This is meant to allow us to do a lossless GRO in the case of TCP
flows that use a fixed IP ID such as those that convert IPv6 header to IPv4
headers.

In addition I am adding a feature that for now I am referring to TSO with
IP ID mangling.  Basically when this flag is enabled the device has the
option to either output the flow with incrementing IP IDs or with a fixed
IP ID regardless of what the original IP ID ordering was.  This is useful
in cases where the DF bit is set and we do not care if the original IP ID
value is maintained.
