drm/fb_helper: Fix references to dev->mode_config.num_connector

During boot, MST hotplugs are generally expected (even if no physical
hotplugging occurs) and result in DRM's connector topology changing.
This means that using num_connector from the current mode configuration
can lead to the number of connectors changing under us. This can lead to
some nasty scenarios in fbcon:

- We allocate an array to the size of dev->mode_config.num_connectors.
- MST hotplug occurs, dev->mode_config.num_connectors gets incremented.
- We try to loop through each element in the array using the new value
  of dev->mode_config.num_connectors, and end up going out of bounds
  since dev->mode_config.num_connectors is now larger then the array we
  allocated.

fb_helper->connector_count however, will always remain consistent while
we do a modeset in fb_helper.

Note: This is just polish for 4.7, Dave Airlie's drm_connector
refcounting fixed these bugs for real. But it's good enough duct-tape
for stable kernel backporting, since backporting the refcounting
changes is way too invasive.

[danvet: Clarify why we need this. Also remove the now unused "dev"
local variable to appease gcc.]
