x86/PCI: Mark Broadwell-EP Home Agent 1 as having non-compliant BARs

Commit b894157145e4 ("x86/PCI: Mark Broadwell-EP Home Agent & PCU as having
non-compliant BARs") marked Home Agent 0 & PCU has having non-compliant
BARs.  Home Agent 1 also has non-compliant BARs.

Mark Home Agent 1 as having non-compliant BARs so the PCI core doesn't
touch them.

The problem with these devices is documented in the Xeon v4 specification
update:

  BDF2          PCI BARs in the Home Agent Will Return Non-Zero Values
                During Enumeration

  Problem:      During system initialization the Operating System may access
                the standard PCI BARs (Base Address Registers).  Due to
                this erratum, accesses to the Home Agent BAR registers (Bus
                1; Device 18; Function 0,4; Offsets (0x14-0x24) will return
                non-zero values.

  Implication:  The operating system may issue a warning.  Intel has not
                observed any functional failures due to this erratum.
