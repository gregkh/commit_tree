mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: fix set_clock when a phy is supported

commit 61b914eb81f8 ("mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: add phy support for
sdhci-of-arasan") introduce phy support for arasan. According to
the vendor's databook, we should make sure the phy is in poweroff
status before we configure the clk stuff. Otherwise it may cause
some IO sample timing issues from the test. And we don't need this
extra operation while running in low performance mode since phy
doesn't trigger sampling block.
