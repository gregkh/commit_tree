iio: st_sensors: support open drain mode

Some types of ST Sensors can be connected to the same IRQ line
as other peripherals using open drain. Add a device tree binding
and a sensor data property to flip the right bit in the interrupt
control register to enable open drain mode on the INT line.

If the line is set to be open drain, also tag on IRQF_SHARED
to the IRQ flags when requesting the interrupt, as the whole
point of using open drain interrupt lines is to share them with
more than one peripheral (wire-or).
