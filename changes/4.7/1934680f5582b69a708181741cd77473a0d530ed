nfp: reorganize initial filling of RX rings

Separate allocation of buffers from giving them to FW,
thanks to this it will be possible to move allocation
earlier on .ndo_open() path and reuse buffers during
runtime reconfiguration.

Similar to TX side clean up the spill of functionality
from flush to freeing the ring.  Unlike on TX side,
RX ring reset does not free buffers from the ring.
Ring reset means only that FW pointers are zeroed and
buffers on the ring must be placed in [0, cnt - 1)
positions.
