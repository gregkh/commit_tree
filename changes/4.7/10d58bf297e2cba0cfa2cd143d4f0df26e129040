s390: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

page_table_alloc then uses the flag for a single page allocation.  This
means that this flag has never been actually useful here because it has
always been used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
