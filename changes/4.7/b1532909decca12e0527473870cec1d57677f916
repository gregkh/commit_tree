iio: remove unused gpio consumer.h include

GPIO handling code has been removed from the drivers (since
this is now handled by the ACPI core) in commit 0f0796509c07 ("iio:
remove gpio interrupt probing from drivers that use a single interrupt").

Remove the include for linux/gpio/consumer.h since it is no longer
used.
