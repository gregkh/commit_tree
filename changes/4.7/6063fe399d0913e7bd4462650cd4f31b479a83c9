lightnvm: rename nvm_targets to nvm_tgt_type

The functions nvm_register_target(), nvm_unregister_target() and
associated list refers to a target type that is being registered by a
target type module. Rename nvm_*_targets() to nvm_*_tgt_type(), so that
the intension is clear.

This enables target instances to use the _nvm_*_targets() naming.
