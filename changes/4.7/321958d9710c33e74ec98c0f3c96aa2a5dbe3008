scripts/gdb: improve types abstraction for gdb python scripts

Change the read_u16 function so it accepts both 'str' and 'byte' as type
for the arguments.

When calling read_memory() from gdb API, depending on if it was built
with 2.7 or 3.X, the format used to return the data will differ ( 'str'
for 2.7, and 'byte' for 3.X ).

Add a function read_memoryview() to be able to get a 'memoryview' object
back from read_memory() both with python 2.7 and 3.X .

Tested with python 3.4 and 2.7
Tested with gdb 7.7
