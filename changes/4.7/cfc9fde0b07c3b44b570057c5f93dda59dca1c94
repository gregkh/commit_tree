ovl: verify upper dentry in ovl_remove_and_whiteout()

The upper dentry may become stale before we call ovl_lock_rename_workdir.
For example, someone could (mistakenly or maliciously) manually unlink(2)
it directly from upperdir.

To ensure it is not stale, let's lookup it after ovl_lock_rename_workdir
and and check if it matches the upper dentry.

Essentially, it is the same problem and similar solution as in
commit 11f3710417d0 ("ovl: verify upper dentry before unlink and rename").
