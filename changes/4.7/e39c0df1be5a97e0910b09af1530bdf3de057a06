pwm: Introduce the pwm_args concept

Currently the PWM core mixes the current PWM state with the per-platform
reference config (specified through the PWM lookup table, DT definition
or directly hardcoded in PWM drivers).

Create a struct pwm_args to store this reference configuration, so that
PWM users can differentiate between the current and reference
configurations.

Patch all places where pwm->args should be initialized. We keep the
pwm_set_polarity/period() calls until all PWM users are patched to use
pwm_args instead of pwm_get_period/polarity().
