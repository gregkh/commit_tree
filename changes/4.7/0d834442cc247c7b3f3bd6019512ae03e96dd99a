net/mlx5: Fix teardown errors that happen in pci error handler

In case of internal error state we will simulate the commands status
through the return value translation function, but we need to simulate
all the teardown fw commands as successful so we will not have fw
command failure prints.
This also fix memory leaks that happen because we skip teardown stages
due to failed fw commands.
