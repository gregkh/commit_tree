tty: Replace ASYNC_INITIALIZED bit and update atomically

Replace ASYNC_INITIALIZED bit in the tty_port::flags field with
TTY_PORT_INITIALIZED bit in the tty_port::iflags field. Introduce helpers
tty_port_set_initialized() and tty_port_initialized() to abstract
atomic bit ops.

Note: the transforms for test_and_set_bit() and test_and_clear_bit()
are unnecessary as the state transitions are already mutually exclusive;
the tty lock prevents concurrent open/close/hangup.
