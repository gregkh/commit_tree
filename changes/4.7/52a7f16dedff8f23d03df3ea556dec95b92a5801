tracing: Add support for multiple hist triggers per event

Allow users to define any number of hist triggers per trace event.
Any number of hist triggers may be added for a given event, which may
differ by key, value, or filter.

Reading the event's 'hist' file will display the output of all the
hist triggers defined on an event concatenated in the order they were
defined.
