rcutorture: Allow for rcupdate.rcu_normal

Currently, rcu_torture_writer() checks only for rcu_gp_is_expedited()
when deciding whether or not to do dynamic control of RCU expediting.
This means that if rcupdate.rcu_normal is specified, rcu_torture_writer()
will attempt to dynamically control RCU expediting, but will nonetheless
only test normal RCU grace periods.  This commit therefore adds a check
for !rcu_gp_is_normal(), and prints a message and desists from testing
dynamic control of RCU expediting when doing so is futile.
