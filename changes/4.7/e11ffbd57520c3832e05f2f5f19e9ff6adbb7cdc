IB/hfi1: Do not free hfi1 cdev parent structure early

The deletion of a cdev is not a fence for holding off references to the
structure. The driver attempts to delete the cdev and then proceeds to
free the parent structure, the hfi1_devdata, or dd. This can potentially
lead to a kernel panic in situations where a user has an FD for the cdev
open, and the pci device gets removed. If the user then closes the FD
there will be a NULL dereference when trying to do put on the cdev's
kobject.

Fix this by pointing the cdev's kobject.parent at a new kobject embedded
in its parent structure. Also take a reference when the device is opened
and put it back when it is closed.
