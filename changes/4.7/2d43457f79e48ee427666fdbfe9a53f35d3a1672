mtd: nand: sunxi: fix EDO mode selection

The ONFI spec says that EDO should be enabled if the host drives tRC less
than 30ns, but the code just tests for the tRC_min value extracted from
the timings exposed by the NAND chip not the timings actually configured
in the NAND controller.
Fix that by first rounding down the requested clk_rate with
clk_round_rate() and then checking if tRC is actually smaller than 30ns.
