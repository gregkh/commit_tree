KVM: remove NULL return path for vcpu ids >= KVM_MAX_VCPUS

Commit c896939f7cff ("KVM: use heuristic for fast VCPU lookup by id") added
a return path that prevents vcpu ids to exceed KVM_MAX_VCPUS. This is a
problem for powerpc where vcpu ids can grow up to 8*KVM_MAX_VCPUS.

This patch simply reverses the logic so that we only try fast path if the
vcpu id can be tried as an index in kvm->vcpus[]. The slow path is not
affected by the change.
