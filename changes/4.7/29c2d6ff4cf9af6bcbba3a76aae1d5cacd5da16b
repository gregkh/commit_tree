KVM: arm/arm64: arch_timer: Rely on the arch timer to parse the firmware tables

The firmware table is currently parsed by the virtual timer code in
order to retrieve the virtual timer interrupt. However, this is already
done by the arch timer driver.

To avoid code duplication, use the newly function arch_timer_get_kvm_info()
which return all the information required by the virtual timer code.
