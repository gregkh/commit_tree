cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix ->set_policy() interface for no_turbo

When turbo is disabled, the ->set_policy() interface is broken.

For example, when turbo is disabled and cpuinfo.max = 2900000 (full
max turbo frequency), setting the limits results in frequency less
than the requested one:
Set 1000000 KHz results in 0700000 KHz
Set 1500000 KHz results in 1100000 KHz
Set 2000000 KHz results in  1500000 KHz

This is because the limits->max_perf fraction is calculated using
the max turbo frequency as the reference, but when the max P-State is
capped in intel_pstate_get_min_max(), the reference is not the max
turbo P-State. This results in reducing max P-State.

One option is to always use max turbo as reference for calculating
limits. But this will not be correct. By definition the intel_pstate
sysfs limits, shows percentage of available performance. So when
BIOS has disabled turbo, the available performance is max non turbo.
So the max_perf_pct should still show 100%.
