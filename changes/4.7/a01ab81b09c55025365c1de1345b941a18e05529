ath9k: define correct GPIO numbers and bits mask

Define correct GPIO numbers and MASK bits to indicate the WMAC
GPIO resource.

Allow SOC chips(AR9340, AR9531, AR9550, AR9561) to access all GPIOs
which rely on gpiolib framework. But restrict SOC AR9330 only to
access WMAC GPIO which has the same design with the old chips.
