powerpc/mm: Replace _PAGE_USER with _PAGE_PRIVILEGED

_PAGE_PRIVILEGED means the page can be accessed only by the kernel. This
is done to keep pte bits similar to PowerISA 3.0 Radix PTE format. User
pages are now marked by clearing _PAGE_PRIVILEGED bit.

Previously we allowed the kernel to have a privileged page in the lower
address range (USER_REGION). With this patch such access is denied.

We also prevent a kernel access to a non-privileged page in higher
address range (ie, REGION_ID != 0).

Both the above access scenarios should never happen.
