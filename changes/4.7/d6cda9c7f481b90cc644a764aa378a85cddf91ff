drm/i915: Correct the i915_frequency_info debugfs output

There are certain registers, which captures the time elapsed in the
in current Up/Down EI, for how long GT has been Idle/Busy/Avg in the
current Up/Down EI and also in the previous Up/Down EI.
These register values are reported by the i915_frequency_info debugfs
interface. The Driver prints the 'us' suffix after the values, albeit
they are actually in raw form & not in microsecond units.
This patch removes the 'us' suffix so that its clear to User that values
are indeed in raw form.

v2: Present the values in microseconds unit also, after platform
    specific conversion (Chris)
v3: Add a space between raw & microsecond value (Chris)
