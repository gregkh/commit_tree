um: fix FPU state preservation around signal handlers

This patch makes UML saves/restores FPU state from/to the fpstate in
pt_regs when setting up or returning from a signal stack, rather than
calling ptrace directly. This ensures that FPU state is correctly
preserved around signal handlers in a multi-threaded scenario.
