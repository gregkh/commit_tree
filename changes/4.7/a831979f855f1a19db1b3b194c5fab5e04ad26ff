rtsx_usb_ms: use schedule_timeout_idle() in polling loop

First version of this patch has already been posted to LKML by Ben
Hutchings ~6 months ago, but no further action were performed.

Ben's original message:

: rtsx_usb_ms creates a task that mostly sleeps, but tasks in
: uninterruptible sleep still contribute to the load average (for
: bug-compatibility with Unix).  A load average of ~1 on a system that
: should be idle is somewhat alarming.
:
: Change the sleep to be interruptible, but still ignore signals.
