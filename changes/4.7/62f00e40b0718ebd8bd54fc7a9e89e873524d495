ALSA: firewire-lib: enable the same feature as CIP_SKIP_INIT_DBC_CHECK flag

In former commit, drivers in ALSA firewire stack always starts IT context
before IR context. If IR context starts after packets are transmitted by
peer unit, packet discontinuity may be detected because the context starts
in the middle of packet streaming. This situation is rare because IT
context usually starts immediately. However, it's better to solve this
issue. This is suppressed with CIP_SKIP_INIT_DBC_CHECK flag.

This commit enables the same feature as CIP_SKIP_INIT_DBC_CHECK.
