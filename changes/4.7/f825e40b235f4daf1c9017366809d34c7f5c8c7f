ncr5380: Remove PSEUDO_DMA macro

For those wrapper drivers which only implement Programmed IO, have
NCR5380_dma_xfer_len() evaluate to zero. That allows PDMA to be easily
disabled at run-time and so the PSEUDO_DMA macro is no longer needed.

Also remove the spin counters used for debugging pseudo DMA drivers.
