net/sched/sch_htb: clamp xstats tokens to fit into 32-bit int

In kernel HTB keeps tokens in signed 64-bit in nanoseconds. In netlink
protocol these values are converted into pshed ticks (64ns for now) and
truncated to 32-bit. In struct tc_htb_xstats fields "tokens" and "ctokens"
are declared as unsigned 32-bit but they could be negative thus tool 'tc'
prints them as signed. Big values loose higher bits and/or become negative.

This patch clamps tokens in xstat into range from INT_MIN to INT_MAX.
In this way it's easier to understand what's going on here.
