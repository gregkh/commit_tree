OMAPDSS: HDMI5: Change DDC timings

The DDC scl high and low times were set to the minimum values
from the i2c specification, but the i2c specification takes into
account the rise time and fall time to calculate the frequency.
To pass HDMI certification DDC can not exceed 100kHz therefore in
a system where the rise times and fall times are negligible the high
and low times for scl need to be 10us.
