KVM: MMU: skip obsolete sp in for_each_gfn_*()

The obsolete sp should not be used on current vCPUs and should not hurt
vCPU's running, so skip it from for_each_gfn_sp() and
for_each_gfn_indirect_valid_sp()

The side effort is we will double check role.invalid in kvm_mmu_get_page()
but i think it is okay as role is well cached
