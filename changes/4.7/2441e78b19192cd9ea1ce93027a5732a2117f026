kbuild: better abstract vmlinux sequential prerequisites

When CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS=y and CONFIG_BUILD_DOCSRC=y it is possible
to get the following error:

ERROR: "cn_del_callback" [Documentation/connector/cn_test.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "cn_add_callback" [Documentation/connector/cn_test.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "cn_netlink_send" [Documentation/connector/cn_test.ko] undefined!
../scripts/Makefile.modpost:91: recipe for target '__modpost' failed

It is not sufficient to do "vmlinux-dirs += Documentation" as this also
depends on the headers_check target, and all of this needs to be done
before adjust_autoksyms.sh is executed.

Let's sort this out by gathering those sequential prerequisites in a make
target of their own, separate from the vmlinux target. And by doing so,
the special autoksyms_recursive target is no longer needed.
