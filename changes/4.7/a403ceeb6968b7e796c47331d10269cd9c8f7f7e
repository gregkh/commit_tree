[media] pctv452e: correct parameters for TechnoTrend TT S2-3600

2008-02-25 Andre Weidemann added support for TT S2-3600 and noted
that he still gets image distortions every now and then.

It seems to be common knowledge in many projects that changing
the USB parameters seems to help. OpenELEC has included this patch
for a few years, for example. Nobody bothered to report the issue
upstream though, it seems.
