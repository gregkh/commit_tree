IB/qib: Use cache inhibitted and guarded mapping on powerpc

The driver was requesting for a writethrough mapping. But with those
flags we will end up with an SAO mapping because we now have memory
conherence always enabled. ie, the existing mapping will end up with a
WIMG value 0b1110 which is Strong Access Order.

Update this to use cache inhibitted guarded mapping.
