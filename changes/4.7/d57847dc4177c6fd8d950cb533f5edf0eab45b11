net/mlx5: Fix wait_vital for VFs and remove fixed sleep

The device ID for VFs is in a different location than PFs. This results
in the poll always timing out for VFs. There's no good way to read the
VF device ID without using the PF's configuration space.  Switch to waiting
for the health poll to start incrementing. Also remove the 1s sleep
at the beginning.

driver')
