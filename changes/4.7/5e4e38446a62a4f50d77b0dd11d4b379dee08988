livepatch: Add some basic livepatch documentation

livepatch framework deserves some documentation, definitely.
This is an attempt to provide some basic info. I hope that
it will be useful for both LivePatch producers and also
potential developers of the framework itself.

[jkosina@suse.cz:
 - incorporated feedback (grammar fixes) from
   Chris J Arges <chris.j.arges@canonical.com>
 - s/LivePatch/livepatch in changelog as pointed out by
   Josh Poimboeuf <jpoimboe@redhat.com>
 - incorporated part of feedback (grammar fixes / reformulations) from
   Balbir Singh <bsingharora@gmail.com>
