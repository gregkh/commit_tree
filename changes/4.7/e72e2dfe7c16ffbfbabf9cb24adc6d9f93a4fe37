gcov: disable -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

When gcov profiling is enabled, we see a lot of spurious warnings about
possibly uninitialized variables being used:

arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c: In function 'arm_coherent_iommu_map_page':
arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c:1085:16: warning: 'start' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/clk/st/clk-flexgen.c: In function 'st_of_flexgen_setup':
drivers/clk/st/clk-flexgen.c:323:9: warning: 'num_parents' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
kernel/cgroup.c: In function 'cgroup_mount':
kernel/cgroup.c:2119:11: warning: 'root' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

All of these are false positives, so it seems better to just disable
the warnings whenever GCOV is enabled. Most users don't enable GCOV,
and based on a prior patch, it is now also disabled for 'allmodconfig'
builds, so there should be no downsides of doing this.
