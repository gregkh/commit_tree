x86/mm: Build arch/x86/mm/tlb.c even on !SMP

Currently all of the functions that live in tlb.c are inlined on
!SMP builds.  One can debate whether this is a good idea (in many
respects the code in tlb.c is better than the inlined UP code).

Regardless, I want to add code that needs to be built on UP and SMP
kernels and relates to tlb flushing, so arrange for tlb.c to be
compiled unconditionally.
