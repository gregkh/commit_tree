So I _should_ have looked at other unserialized users of ->load_avg,
but alas. Luckily nikbor reported a similar /0 from task_h_load() which
instantly triggered recollection of this here problem.

Aside from the intermediate value hitting memory and causing problems,
there's another problem: the underflow detection relies on the signed
bit. This reduces the effective width of the variables, IOW its
effectively the same as having these variables be of signed type.

This patch changes to a different means of unsigned underflow
detection to not rely on the signed bit. This allows the variables to
use the 'full' unsigned range. And it does so with explicit LOAD -
STORE to ensure any intermediate value will never be visible in
memory, allowing these unserialized loads.

Note: GCC generates crap code for this, might warrant a look later.

Note2: I say 'full' above, if we end up at U*_MAX we'll still explode;
       maybe we should do clamping on add too.
