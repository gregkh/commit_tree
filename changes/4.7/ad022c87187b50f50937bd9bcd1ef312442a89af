Revert "mtd: switch ubi_open_volume_path() to vfs_stat()"

This reverts commit 322ea0bbf3003df17b6253f76e572c37d79a6810.

vfs_stat() can only be used on user supplied buffers.
UBI's kapi.c is the API to the kernel and therefore vfs_stat()
is inappropriate.

This solves the problem that mounting any UBIFS will immediately
fail with -EINVAL.
