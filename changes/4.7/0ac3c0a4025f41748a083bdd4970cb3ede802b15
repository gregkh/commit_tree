pinctrl: single: Fix missing flush of posted write for a wakeirq

With many repeated suspend resume cycles, the pin specific wakeirq
may not always work on omaps. This is because the write to enable the
pin interrupt may not have reached the device over the interconnect
before suspend happens.

Let's fix the issue with a flush of posted write with a readback.
