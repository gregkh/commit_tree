net: rtnetlink: allow rtnl_fill_statsinfo to save private state counter

The new prividx argument allows the current dumping device to save a
private state counter which would enable it to continue dumping from
where it left off. And the idxattr is used to save the current idx user
so multiple prividx using attributes can be requested at the same time
as suggested by Roopa Prabhu.
