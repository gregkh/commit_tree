tcp: remove false sharing in tcp_rcv_state_process()

Last known hot point during SYNFLOOD attack is the clearing
of rx_opt.saw_tstamp in tcp_rcv_state_process()

It is not needed for a listener, so we move it where it matters.

Performance while a SYNFLOOD hits a single listener socket
went from 5 Mpps to 6 Mpps on my test server (24 cores, 8 NIC RX queues)
