cxlflash: Fix to resolve dead-lock during EEH recovery

When a cxlflash adapter goes into EEH recovery and multiple processes
(each having established its own context) are active, the EEH recovery
can hang if the processes attempt to recover in parallel. The symptom
logged after a couple of minutes is:

INFO: task eehd:48 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

The hang is because of a 3 way dead-lock:

Process A holds the recovery mutex, and waits for eehd to complete.
Process B holds the semaphore and waits for the recovery mutex.
eehd waits for semaphore.

The fix is to have Process B above release the semaphore before
attempting to acquire the recovery mutex. This will allow
eehd to proceed to completion.
