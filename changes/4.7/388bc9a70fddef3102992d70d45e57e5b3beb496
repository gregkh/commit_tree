ARM: dts: sun8i: Fix wrong Quad core / a33 compat for sun8i-a23-gt90h-v4

As the dts file name already implies sun8i-a23-gt90h-v4.dts is for
an a23 equipped tablet. I don't know how the "Quad Core" or a33
comaptible got in there, likely a copy and paste error.

Regardless this commit fixes this, note this is almost
purely a cosmetical fix, for all things that matter at the
machine compatible level the a23 and a33 are compatible.
