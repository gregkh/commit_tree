KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add PENDING registers handlers

The pending register handlers are shared between the v2 and v3
emulation, so their implementation goes into vgic-mmio.c, to be easily
referenced from the v3 emulation as well later.
For level triggered interrupts the real line level is unaffected by
this write, so we keep this state separate and combine it with the
device's level to get the actual pending state.
