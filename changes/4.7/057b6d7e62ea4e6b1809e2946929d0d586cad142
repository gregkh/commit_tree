powerpc/book3s64: Remove __end_handlers marker

The __end_handlers marker was intended to mark down upto code that gets
called from exception prologs. But that hasn't kept pace with code
changes. Case in point, slb_miss_realmode being called from exception
prolog code but isn't below __end_handlers marker. So, __end_handlers
marker is as good as a comment but could be misleading at times if it
isn't in sync with the code, as is the case now. So, let us avoid this
confusion by having a better comment and removing __end_handlers marker
altogether.
