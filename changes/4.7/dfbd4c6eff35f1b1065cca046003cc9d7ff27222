drivers/of: Split unflatten_dt_node()

The function unflatten_dt_node() is called recursively to unflatten
device nodes and properties in the FDT blob. It looks complicated
and hard to be understood.

This splits the function into 3 functions: populate_properties(),
populate_node() and unflatten_dt_node(). populate_properties(),
which is called by populate_node(), creates properties for the
indicated device node. The later one creates the device nodes
from FDT blob. populate_node() gets the offset in FDT blob for
next device nodes and then calls populate_node(). No logical
changes introduced.
