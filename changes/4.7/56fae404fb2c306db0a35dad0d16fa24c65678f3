bridge: Fix incorrect re-injection of STP packets

Commit 8626c56c8279 ("bridge: fix potential use-after-free when hook
returns QUEUE or STOLEN verdict") fixed incorrect usage of NF_HOOK's
return value by consuming packets in okfn via br_pass_frame_up().

However, this function re-injects packets to the Rx path with skb->dev
set to the bridge device, which breaks kernel's STP, as all STP packets
appear to originate from the bridge device itself.

Instead, if STP is enabled and bridge isn't a 802.1ad bridge, then learn
packet's SMAC and inject it back to the Rx path for further processing
by the packet handlers.

The patch also makes netfilter's behavior consistent with regards to
packets destined to the Bridge Group Address, as no hook registered at
LOCAL_IN will ever be called, regardless if STP is enabled or not.
