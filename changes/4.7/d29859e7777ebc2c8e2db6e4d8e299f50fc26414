x86/perf/intel/cstate: Sanitize error handling

There is no point in WARN_ON() inside of a well known init function. We
already know the call stack and it's really not of critical importance whether
the registration of a PMU fails.

Aside of that for consistency reasons it's just pointless to try to register
another PMU if the first register attempt failed. There is also no value in
keeping one PMU if the second one can not be registered.

Make it consistent so we can finaly modularize the driver.
