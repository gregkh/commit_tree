KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: enable build

Now that the new VGIC implementation has reached feature parity with
the old one, add the new files to the build system and add a Kconfig
option to switch between the two versions.
We set the default to the new version to get maximum test coverage,
in case people experience problems they can switch back to the old
behaviour if needed.
