coredump: fix dumping through pipes

The offset in the core file used to be tracked with ->written field of
the coredump_params structure. The field was retired in favour of
file->f_pos.

However, ->f_pos is not maintained for pipes which leads to breakage.

Restore explicit tracking of the offset in coredump_params. Introduce
->pos field for this purpose since ->written was already reused.

Fixes: a00839395103 ("get rid of coredump_params->written").
