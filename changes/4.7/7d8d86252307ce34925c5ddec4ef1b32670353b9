Input: gpio-keys - clean up device tree binding example

Drop #address-cells and #size-cells, which are not required by the
gpio-keys binding documentation, as button sub-nodes are not devices.

Rename sub-nodes to avoid new dtc unit address warnings when copied.

While at it, adopt the dashes convention for the node name.
