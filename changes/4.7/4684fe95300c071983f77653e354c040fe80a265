h8300: Add <asm/hash.h>

This will improve the performance of hash_32() and hash_64(), but due
to complete lack of multi-bit shift instructions on H8, performance will
still be bad in surrounding code.

Designing H8-specific hash algorithms to work around that is a separate
project.  (But if the maintainers would like to get in touch...)
