xen-netback: add control ring boilerplate

My recent patch to include/xen/interface/io/netif.h defines a new shared
ring (in addition to the rx and tx rings) for passing control messages
from a VM frontend driver to a backend driver.

This patch adds the necessary code to xen-netback to map this new shared
ring, should it be created by a frontend, but does not add implementations
for any of the defined protocol messages. These are added in a subsequent
patch for clarity.
