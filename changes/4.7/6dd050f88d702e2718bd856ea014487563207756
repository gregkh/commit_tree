rxrpc: Don't assume transport address family and size when using it

Don't assume transport address family and size when using the peer address
to send a packet.  Instead, use the start of the transport address rather
than any particular element of the union and use the transport address
length noted inside the sockaddr_rxrpc struct.

This will be necessary when IPv6 support is introduced.
