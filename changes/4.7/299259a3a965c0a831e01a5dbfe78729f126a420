drm/i915: Store the reset counter when constructing a request

As the request is only valid during the same global reset epoch, we can
record the current reset_counter when constructing the request and reuse
it when waiting upon that request in future. This removes a very hairy
atomic check serialised by the struct_mutex at the time of waiting and
allows us to transfer those waits to a central dispatcher for all
waiters and all requests.

PS: With per-engine resets, we obviously cannot assume a global reset
epoch for the requests - a per-engine epoch makes the most sense. The
challenge then is how to handle checking in the waiter for when to break
the wait, as the fine-grained reset may also want to requeue the
request (i.e. the assumption that just because the epoch changes the
request is completed may be broken - or we just avoid breaking that
assumption with the fine-grained resets).
