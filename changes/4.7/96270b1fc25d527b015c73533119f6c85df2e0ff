powerpc/mm: Remove RPN_SHIFT and RPN_SIZE

PTE_RPN_SHIFT is actually page size dependent. Even though PowerISA 3.0
expects only the lower 12 bits to be zero, we will always find the pages
to be PAGE_SHIFT aligned. In case of hash config, this also allows us to
use the additional 3 bits to track pte specific information. We need
to make sure we use these bits only for hash specific pte flags.

For both 4K and 64K config, pte now can hold 57 bits address.

Inorder to keep things simpler, drop PTE_RPN_SHIFT and PTE_RPN_SIZE and
specify the 57 bit detail explicitly.
