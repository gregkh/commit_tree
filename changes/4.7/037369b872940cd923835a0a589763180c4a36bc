hpfs: implement the show_options method

The HPFS filesystem used generic_show_options to produce string that is
displayed in /proc/mounts.  However, there is a problem that the options
may disappear after remount.  If we mount the filesystem with option1
and then remount it with option2, /proc/mounts should show both option1
and option2, however it only shows option2 because the whole option
string is replaced with replace_mount_options in hpfs_remount_fs.

To fix this bug, implement the hpfs_show_options function that prints
options that are currently selected.
