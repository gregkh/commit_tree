usb: musb: Use delayed for musb_gadget_pullup

We have MUSB setting pm_runtime_irq_safe with the following
commits:

30a70b026b4c ("usb: musb: fix obex in g_nokia.ko causing kernel panic")
3e43a0725637 ("usb: musb: core: add pm_runtime_irq_safe()")

Let's fix things to use delayed work so we can remove the
pm_runtime_irq_safe.

Note that we may want to set this up in a generic way in the
gadget framework eventually.
