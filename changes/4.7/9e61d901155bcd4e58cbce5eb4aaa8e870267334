iio: light: tsl2563: Remove flush_scheduled_work

flush_scheduled_work is scheduled for deprecation.
Replace cancel_delayed_work and flush_scheduled_work with
cancel_delayed_work_sync instead to ensure there is no pending or
running work item.

Since there is only one work item, chip->poweroff_work, there are
no further dependencies of flush_scheduled_work().
