fs: fix binfmt_aout.c build error

Various builds (such as i386:allmodconfig) fail with

  fs/binfmt_aout.c:133:2: error: expected identifier or '(' before 'return'
  fs/binfmt_aout.c:134:1: error: expected identifier or '(' before '}' token

[ Oops. My bad, I had stupidly thought that "allmodconfig" covered this
  on x86-64 too, but it obviously doesn't.  Egg on my face.  - Linus ]
