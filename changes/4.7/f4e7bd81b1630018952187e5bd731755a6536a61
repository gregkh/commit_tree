stmmac: let remove/resume/suspend functions take device pointer

Change stmmac_remove/resume/suspend to take a device pointer so
they can be used directly by drivers that doesn't need to perform
anything device specific.

This lets us remove the PCI pm functions and later simplifiy the
platform drivers.
