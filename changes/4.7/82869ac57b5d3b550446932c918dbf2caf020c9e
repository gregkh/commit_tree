arm64: kernel: Add support for hibernate/suspend-to-disk

Add support for hibernate/suspend-to-disk.

Suspend borrows code from cpu_suspend() to write cpu state onto the stack,
before calling swsusp_save() to save the memory image.

Restore creates a set of temporary page tables, covering only the
linear map, copies the restore code to a 'safe' page, then uses the copy to
restore the memory image. The copied code executes in the lower half of the
address space, and once complete, restores the original kernel's page
tables. It then calls into cpu_resume(), and follows the normal
cpu_suspend() path back into the suspend code.

To restore a kernel using KASLR, the address of the page tables, and
cpu_resume() are stored in the hibernate arch-header and the el2
vectors are pivotted via the 'safe' page in low memory.
