ovl: handle ATTR_KILL*

Before 4bacc9c9234c ("overlayfs: Make f_path...") file->f_path pointed to
the underlying file, hence suid/sgid removal on write worked fine.

After that patch file->f_path pointed to the overlay file, and the file
mode bits weren't copied to overlay_inode->i_mode.  So the suid/sgid
removal simply stopped working.

The fix is to copy the mode bits, but then ovl_setattr() needs to clear
ATTR_MODE to avoid the BUG() in notify_change().  So do this first, then in
the next patch copy the mode.
