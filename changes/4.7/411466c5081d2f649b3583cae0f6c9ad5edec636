PM / OPP: add non-OF versions of dev_pm_opp_{cpumask_, }remove_table

Functions dev_pm_opp_of_{cpumask_,}remove_table removes/frees all the
static OPP entries associated with the device and/or all cpus(in case
of cpumask) that are created from DT.

However the OPP entries are populated reading from the firmware or some
different method using dev_pm_opp_add are marked dynamic and can't be
removed using above functions.

This patch adds non DT/OF versions of dev_pm_opp_{cpumask_,}remove_table
to support the above mentioned usecase.

This is in preparation to make use of the same in scpi-cpufreq.c
