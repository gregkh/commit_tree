i2c: i2c-mux-pca954x: convert to use an explicit i2c mux core

Allocate an explicit i2c mux core to handle parent and child adapters
etc. Update the select/deselect ops to be in terms of the i2c mux core
instead of the child adapter.

Add a mask to handle the case where not all child adapters should
cause a mux deselect to happen, now that there is a common deselect op
for all child adapters.
