ixgbe: add a callback to set the maximum transmit bitrate

This commit adds a callback which allows to adjust the maximum transmit
bitrate the card can output. This makes it possible to get a smooth
traffic instead of the default burst-y behaviour when trying to output
e.g. a video stream.

Much of the logic needed to get a correct bcnrc_val was taken from the
ixgbe_set_vf_rate_limit() function.
