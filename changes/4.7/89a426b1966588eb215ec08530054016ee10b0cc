clk: mvebu: new driver for Armada AP806 system controller

The Armada AP806 system controller, amongst other things, provides a
number of clocks for the platform: the CPU cluster clocks, whose
frequencies are found by reading the Sample At Reset register, one
fixed clock, and another clock derived from the fixed clock, which is
the one used by most peripherals in AP806.

The AP806 is one of the two core HW blocks used in the Marvell 7K/8K
SoCs.
