rcu: Make expedited RCU-sched grace period immediately detect idle

Currently, sync_sched_exp_handler() will force a reschedule unless
this CPU has already checked in or unless a reschedule has already
been called for.  This is clearly wasteful if sync_sched_exp_handler()
interrupted an idle CPU, so this commit immediately reports the
quiescent state in that case.
