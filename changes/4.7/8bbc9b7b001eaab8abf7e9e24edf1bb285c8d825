powerpc/mm/hash64: Factor out hash preload psize check

Currently we have a check in hash_preload() against the psize, which is
only included when CONFIG_PPC_MM_SLICES is enabled. We want to expand
this check in a subsequent patch, so factor it out to allow that. As a
bonus it removes the #ifdef in the C code.

Unfortunately we can't put this in the existing CONFIG_PPC_MM_SLICES
block because it would require a forward declaration.
