ALSA: firewire-digi00x: delayed registration of sound card

When some digi00x units are connected sequentially, userspace
applications are involved at bus-reset state on IEEE 1394 bus. In the
state, any communications can be canceled. Therefore, sound card
registration should be delayed till the bus gets calm.

This commit achieves it.
