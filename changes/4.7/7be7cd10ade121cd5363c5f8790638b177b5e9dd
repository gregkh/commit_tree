staging: comedi: drivers: fix possible bug in comedi_handle_events()

This function assumes that the async subdevice has a cancel() function.
It looks like all the current comedi drivers implement a cancel() for
the async subdevices except for the dt2814 analog input usbdevice.

Fix comedi_handle_events() so it does not try to call a non-existent
cancel() function.

Add a dev_warn() to __comedi_device_postconfig_async() so that any new
driver authors will be reminded to implement the cancel().
