staging: wilc1000: rename result in handle_get_mac_address

This patch renames result to ret that is used to get return value from
wilc_send_config_pkt. Some handle_*() functions are used as result,
others are used as ret. It will be changed as ret in all handle_*()
functions to match variable name.
