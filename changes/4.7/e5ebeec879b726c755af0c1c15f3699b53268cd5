arm64: kernel: use literal for relocated address of __secondary_switched

We can simply use a relocated 64-bit literal to store the address of
__secondary_switched(), and the relocation code will ensure that it
holds the correct value at secondary entry time, as long as we make sure
that the literal is not dereferenced until after we have enabled the MMU.

So jump via a small __secondary_switch() function covered by the ID map
that performs the literal load and branch-to-register.
