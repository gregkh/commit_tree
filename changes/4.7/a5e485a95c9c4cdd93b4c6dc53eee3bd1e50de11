drm/i915: Clear VLV_IER around irq processing

On VLV/CHV the master interrupt enable bit only affects GT/PM
interrupts. Display interrupts are not affected by the master
irq control.

Also it seems that the CPU interrupt will only be generated when
the combined result of all GT/PM/display interrupts has a 0->1
edge. We already use the master interrupt enable bit to make sure
GT/PM interrupt can generate such an edge if we don't end up clearing
all IIR bits. We must do the same for display interrupts, and for
that we can simply clear out VLV_IER, and restore after we've acked
all the interrupts we are about to process.

So with both master interrupt enable and VLV_IER cleared out, we will
guarantee that there will be a 0->1 edge if any IIR bits are still set
at the end, and thus another CPU interrupt will be generated.
