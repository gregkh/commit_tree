mm/slab: remove BAD_ALIEN_MAGIC again

Initial attemp to remove BAD_ALIEN_MAGIC is once reverted by 'commit
edcad2509550 ("Revert "slab: remove BAD_ALIEN_MAGIC"")' because it
causes a problem on m68k which has many node but !CONFIG_NUMA.  In this
case, although alien cache isn't used at all but to cope with some
initialization path, garbage value is used and that is BAD_ALIEN_MAGIC.
Now, this patch set use_alien_caches to 0 when !CONFIG_NUMA, there is no
initialization path problem so we don't need BAD_ALIEN_MAGIC at all.  So
remove it.
