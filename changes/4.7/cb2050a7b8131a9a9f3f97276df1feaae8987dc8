sctp: export some functions for sctp_diag in inet_diag

inet_diag_msg_common_fill is used to fill the diag msg common info,
we need to use it in sctp_diag as well, so export it.

inet_diag_msg_attrs_fill is used to fill some common attrs info between
sctp diag and tcp diag.

v2->v3:
- do not need to define and export inet_diag_get_handler any more.
  cause all the functions in it are in sctp_diag.ko, we just call
  them in sctp_diag.ko.

- add inet_diag_msg_attrs_fill to make codes clear.
