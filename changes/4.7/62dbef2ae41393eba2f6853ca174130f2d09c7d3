sunrpc: add a get_rpccred_rcu inline

Sometimes we might have a RCU managed credential pointer and don't want
to use locking to handle it. Add a function that will take a reference
to the cred iff the refcount is not already zero. Callers can dereference
the pointer under the rcu_read_lock and use that function to take a
reference only if the cred is not on its way to destruction.
