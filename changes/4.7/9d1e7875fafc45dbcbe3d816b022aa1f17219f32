MIPS: JZ4740: Probe OHCI platform device via DT

The DT fragment will select the ohci-platform driver, since that can
handle the JZ4740 OHCI just fine. While I don't have a JZ4740-based
board with anything connected to the USB host controller, I did test
the generic OHCI driver successfully on a JZ4770-based board.

The device is disabled by default; boards that want to use it can
override the "status" property. The mass-production Qi LB60 boards
don't use the USB host controller.
