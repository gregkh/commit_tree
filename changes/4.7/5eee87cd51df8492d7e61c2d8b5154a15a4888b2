ixgbe: Fix VLAN features error

It looks like at some point I somehow transposed the location of setting
the VLAN features in netdev->features and the configuration of the
vlan_features.  As a result the driver is now generating a warning about
vlan_features being setup incorrectly.

This patch corrects that by placing the update of netdev->features to
include the VLAN features so that it is after the point where we write
netdev->features into netdev->vlan_features.
