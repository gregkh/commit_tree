mm, page_alloc: pull out side effects from free_pages_check

Check without side-effects should be easier to maintain.  It also
removes the duplicated cpupid and flags reset done in !DEBUG_VM variant
of both free_pcp_prepare() and then bulkfree_pcp_prepare().  Finally, it
enables the next patch.

It shouldn't result in new branches, thanks to inlining of the check.

!DEBUG_VM bloat-o-meter:

  add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/2 up/down: 0/-27 (-27)
  function                                     old     new   delta
  __free_pages_ok                              748     739      -9
  free_pcppages_bulk                          1403    1385     -18

DEBUG_VM:

  add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/1 up/down: 0/-28 (-28)
  function                                     old     new   delta
  free_pages_prepare                           806     778     -28

This is also slightly faster because cpupid information is not set on
tail pages so we can avoid resets there.
