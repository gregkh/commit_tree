tracing: Add hist trigger support for stacktraces as keys

It's often useful to be able to use a stacktrace as a hash key, for
keeping a count of the number of times a particular call path resulted
in a trace event, for instance.  Add a special key named 'stacktrace'
which can be used as key in a 'keys=' param for this purpose:

    # echo hist:keys=stacktrace ... \
               [ if filter] > event/trigger
