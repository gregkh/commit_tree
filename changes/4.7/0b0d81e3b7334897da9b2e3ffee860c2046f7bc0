objtool, drm/vmwgfx: Fix "duplicate frame pointer save" warning

objtool reports the following warnings:

  drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_msg.o: warning: objtool: vmw_send_msg()+0x107: duplicate frame pointer save
  drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_msg.o: warning: objtool: vmw_host_get_guestinfo()+0x252: duplicate frame pointer save

To quote Linus:

 "The reason is that VMW_PORT_HB_OUT() uses a magic instruction sequence
  (a "rep outsb") to communicate with the hypervisor (it's a virtual GPU
  driver for vmware), and %rbp is part of the communication. So the
  inline asm does a save-and-restore of the frame pointer around the
  instruction sequence.

  I actually find the objtool warning to be quite reasonable, so it's
  not exactly a false positive, since in this case it actually does
  point out that the frame pointer won't be reliable over that
  instruction sequence.

  But in this particular case it just ends up being the wrong thing -
  the code is what it is, and %rbp just can't have the frame information
  due to annoying magic calling conventions."

Silence the warnings by telling objtool to ignore the two functions
which use the VMW_PORT_HB_{IN,OUT} macros.
