staging: lustre: o2iblnd: Use list_for_each_entry_safe in kiblnd_destroy_fmr_pool_list

Doubly linked lists which are iterated using list_empty
and list_entry macros have been replaced with list_for_each_entry_safe
macro. This makes the iteration simpler and more readable.

This patch replaces the while loop containing list_empty and list_entry
with list_for_each_entry_safe.
