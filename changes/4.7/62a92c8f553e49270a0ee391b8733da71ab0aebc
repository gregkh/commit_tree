perf/core: Remove a redundant check

There is no way to end up in _free_event() with event::pmu being NULL.
The latter is initialized in event allocation path and remains set
forever. In case of allocation failure, the error path doesn't use
_free_event().

Having the check, however, suggests that it is possible to have a
event::pmu==NULL situation in _free_event() and confuses the robots.

This patch gets rid of the check.
