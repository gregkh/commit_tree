drm/i915: Avoid early timeout during AUX transfers

Since wait_for_atomic doesn't re-check the wait-for condition after
expiry of the timeout it can fail when called from non-atomic context
even if the condition is set correctly before the expiry. Fix this by
using the non-atomic wait_for instead.

Due to the relatively long 10ms timeout, probably this didn't cause any
real problems, but fix it in any case for consistency.
