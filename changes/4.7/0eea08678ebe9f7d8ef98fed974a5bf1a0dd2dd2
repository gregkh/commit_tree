kexec: do a cleanup for function kexec_load

There are a lof of work to be done in function kexec_load, not only for
allocating structs and loading initram, but also for some misc.

To make it more clear, wrap a new function do_kexec_load which is used
to allocate structs and load initram.  And the pre-work will be done in
kexec_load.
