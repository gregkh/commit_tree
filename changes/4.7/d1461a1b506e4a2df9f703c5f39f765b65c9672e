ACPICA: Events: Fix an issue that _REG association can happen before namespace is initialized

ACPICA commit c508f8592efaa0d8197f26d7fee6382c5ac8e383

Current code flow cannot ensure _REG association can happen after the
namespace is initialized, so we move _REG association to where _REG was
about to run to fix this issue.

This issue is detected when acpi_ev_initialize_region() is invoked during
the table loading. And this is one of the most important the root cause why
ACPICA table loading is split into 2 load passes. Lv Zheng.
