tipc: fix nl compat regression for link statistics

Fix incorrect use of nla_strlcpy() where the first NLA_HDRLEN bytes
of the link name where left out.

Making the output of tipc-config -ls look something like:
Link statistics:
dcast-link
1:data0-1.1.2:data0
1:data0-1.1.3:data0

Also, for the record, the patch that introduce this regression
claims "Sending the whole object out can cause a leak". Which isn't
very likely as this is a compat layer, where the data we are parsing
is generated by us and we know the string to be NULL terminated. But
you can of course never be to secure.
