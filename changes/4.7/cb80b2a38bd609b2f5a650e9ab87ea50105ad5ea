MIPS: remove aliasing alignment if HW has antialising support

MIPS hardware may have an antialising support and it works even
page size is small.

Setup a shared memory aliasing mask to page size if hardware has
an antialising support. Big shared memory mask forces a disruption
in page address assignment and that corrupts Android library memory
handling.
