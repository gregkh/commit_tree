drm/i915: check for ERR_PTR from i915_gem_object_pin_map()

The newly-introduced function i915_gem_object_pin_map() returns an
ERR_PTR (not NULL) if the pin-and-map opertaion fails, so that's what we
must check for. And it's nicer not to assign such a pointer-or-error to
a structure being filled in until after it's been validated, so we
should keep it local and avoid exporting a bogus pointer. Also, for
clarity and symmetry, we should clear 'virtual_start' along with 'vma'
when unmapping a ringbuffer.
