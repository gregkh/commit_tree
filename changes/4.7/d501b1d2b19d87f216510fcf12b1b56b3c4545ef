drm/i915: Add GEM debugging Kconfig option

Currently there is a #define to enable extra BUG_ON for debugging
requests and associated activities. I want to expand its use to cover
all of GEM internals (so that we can saturate the code with asserts).
We can add a Kconfig option to make it easier to enable - with the usual
caveats of not enabling unless explicitly requested.
