dmaengine: dw: define counter variables as unsigned int

The code is fixed to satisfy a compiler otherwise we have

drivers/dma/dw/core.c: In function ‘dwc_handle_cyclic’:
drivers/dma/dw/core.c:568: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
drivers/dma/dw/core.c: In function ‘dw_dma_tasklet’:
drivers/dma/dw/core.c:590: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
drivers/dma/dw/core.c: In function ‘dw_dma_off’:
drivers/dma/dw/core.c:1103: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
drivers/dma/dw/core.c: In function ‘dw_dma_cyclic_free’:
drivers/dma/dw/core.c:1469: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
drivers/dma/dw/core.c: In function ‘dw_dma_probe’:
drivers/dma/dw/core.c:1574: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned

There is no functional change.
