ACPI / x86: Cleanup initrd related code

In arch/x86/kernel/setup.c, the #ifdef kept for CONFIG_ACPI actually is
related to the accessibility of initrd_start/initrd_end, so the stub should
be provided from this source file and should only be dependent on
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD.

Note that when ACPI=n and BLK_DEV_INITRD=y, early_initrd_acpi_init() is
still a stub because of the stub prepared for early_acpi_table_init().
