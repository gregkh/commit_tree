efi/arm*: Use memremap() to create the persistent memmap mapping

Instead of using ioremap_cache(), which is slightly inappropriate for
mapping firmware tables, and is not even allowed on ARM for mapping
regions that are covered by a struct page, use memremap(), which was
invented for this purpose, and will also reuse the existing kernel
direct mapping if the requested region is covered by it.
