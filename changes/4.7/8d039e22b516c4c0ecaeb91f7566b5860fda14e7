scsi_debug: rework resp_report_luns

Based on "[PATH V2] scsi_debug: rework resp_report_luns" patch
sent by Tomas Winkler on Thursday, 26 Feb 2015. His notes:
  1. Remove duplicated boundary checks which simplify the fill-in
     loop
  2. Use more of scsi generic API
Replace fixed length response array a with heap allocation
allowing up to 256 normal LUNs per target.
