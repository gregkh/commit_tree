qede: Fix DMA address APIs usage

Driver incorrectly uses dma_unmap_addr_set() to set
a variable which is in truth a dma_addr_t
[i.e not defined using DEFINE_DMA_UNMAP_ADDR()] and is
being used by the driver flows other than unmapping
physical addresses. This patch fixes driver fastpath
where CONFIG_NEED_DMA_MAP_STATE is not set.
