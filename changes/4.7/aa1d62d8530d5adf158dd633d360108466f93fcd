radix tree test suite: keep regression test runs short

Currently the full suite of regression tests take upwards of 30 minutes
to run on my development machine.  The vast majority of this time is
taken by the big_gang_check() and copy_tag_check() tests, which each run
their tests through thousands of iterations...does this have value?

Without big_gang_check() and copy_tag_check(), the test suite runs in
around 15 seconds on my box.

Honestly the first time I ever ran through the entire test suite was to
gather the timings for this email - it simply takes too long to be
useful on a normal basis.

Instead, hide the excessive iterations through big_gang_check() and
copy_tag_check() tests behind an '-l' flag (for "long run") in case they
are still useful, but allow the regression test suite to complete in a
reasonable amount of time.  We still run each of these tests a few times
(3 at present) to try and keep the test coverage.
