sched/fair: Fix comment in calculate_imbalance()

The comment in calculate_imbalance() was introduced in commit:

 2dd73a4f09be ("[PATCH] sched: implement smpnice")

which described the logic as it was then, but a later commit:

  b18855500fc4 ("sched/balancing: Fix 'local->avg_load > sds->avg_load' case in calculate_imbalance()")

.. complicated this logic some more so that the comment does not match anymore.

Update the comment to match the code.
