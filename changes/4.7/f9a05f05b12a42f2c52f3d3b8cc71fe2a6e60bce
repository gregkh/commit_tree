iommu/arm-smmu: Tidy up 64-bit/atomic I/O accesses

With {read,write}q_relaxed now able to fall back to the common
nonatomic-hi-lo helper, make use of that so that we don't have to
open-code our own. In the process, also convert the other remaining
split accesses, and repurpose the custom accessor to smooth out the
couple of troublesome instances where we really want to avoid
nonatomic writes (and a 64-bit access is unnecessary in the 32-bit
context formats we would use on a 32-bit CPU).

This paves the way for getting rid of some of the assumptions currently
baked into the driver which make it really awkward to use 32-bit context
formats with SMMUv2 under a 64-bit kernel.
