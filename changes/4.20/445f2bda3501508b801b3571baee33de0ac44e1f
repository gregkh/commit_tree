arm64: dts: meson: Switch simple-mfd and syscon order

The order between "syscon" and "simple-mfd" is important because in these
particular cases, the node needs to be first a "simple-mfd" to expose
it's sub-nodes, and later on a "syscon" to permit other nodes to access
this register space through the "syscon" mechanism.
