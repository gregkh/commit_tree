signal: Simplify tracehook_report_syscall_exit

Replace user_single_step_siginfo with user_single_step_report
that allocates siginfo structure on the stack and sends it.

This allows tracehook_report_syscall_exit to become a simple
if statement that calls user_single_step_report or ptrace_report_syscall
depending on the value of step.

Update the default helper function now called user_single_step_report
to explicitly set si_code to SI_USER and to set si_uid and si_pid to 0.
The default helper has always been doing this (using memset) but it
was far from obvious.

The powerpc helper can now just call force_sig_fault.
The x86 helper can now just call send_sigtrap.

Unfortunately the default implementation of user_single_step_report
can not use force_sig_fault as it does not use a SIGTRAP si_code.
So it has to carefully setup the siginfo and use use force_sig_info.

The net result is code that is easier to understand and simpler
to maintain.
