net: hns3: bugfix for is_valid_csq_clean_head()

The HEAD pointer of the hardware command queue maybe equal to the command
queue's next_to_use in the driver, so that does not belong to the invalid
HEAD pointer, since the hardware may not process the command in time,
causing the HEAD pointer to be too late to update. The variables' name
in this function is unreadable, so give them a more readable one.
