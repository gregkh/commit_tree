scsi: esp_scsi: use strong typing for the dev field

esp->dev is a void pointer that points either to a struct device, or a
struct platform_device.  As we can easily get from the device to the
platform_device if needed change it to always point to a struct device
and properly type the pointer to avoid errors.
