mm: remove unnecessary local variable addr in __get_user_pages_fast()

The local variable `addr' in __get_user_pages_fast() is just a shadow of
`start'.  Since `start' never changes after assignment to `addr', it is
fine to replace `start' with it.

Also the meaning of [start, end] is more obvious than [addr, end] when
passed to gup_pgd_range().
