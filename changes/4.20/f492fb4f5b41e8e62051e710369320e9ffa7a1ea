media: MAINTAINERS: Fix entry for the renamed dw9807 driver

The driver for the dw9807 voice coil was renamed as dw9807-vcm.c to
reflect the fact that the chip also contains an EEPROM. While there is no
EEPROM (nor MFD) driver yet and it may not be ever even needed, the driver
was renamed accordingly. But the MAINTAINERS entry was not. Fix this.
