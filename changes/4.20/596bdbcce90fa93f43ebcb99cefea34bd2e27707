wil6210: set edma variables only for Talyn-MB devices

use_rx_hw_reordering is already set to true in wil_set_capabilities
for Talyn-MB devices. Remove its setting from wil_priv_init to
prevent its activation for older chips.
Similarly, move the setting of use_compressed_rx_status to
wil_set_capabilities.
