signal: Properly deliver SIGILL from uprobes

For userspace to tell the difference between a random signal and an
exception, the exception must include siginfo information.

Using SEND_SIG_FORCED for SIGILL is thus wrong, and it will result
in userspace seeing si_code == SI_USER (like a random signal) instead
of si_code == SI_KERNEL or a more specific si_code as all exceptions
deliver.

Therefore replace force_sig_info(SIGILL, SEND_SIG_FORCE, current)
with force_sig(SIG_ILL, current) which gets this right and is
shorter and easier to type.
