mac80211: ignore NullFunc frames in the duplicate detection

NullFunc packets should never be duplicate just like
QoS-NullFunc packets.

We saw a client that enters / exits power save with
NullFunc frames (and not with QoS-NullFunc) despite the
fact that the association supports HT.
This specific client also re-uses a non-zero sequence number
for different NullFunc frames.
At some point, the client had to send a retransmission of
the NullFunc frame and we dropped it, leading to a
misalignment in the power save state.
Fix this by never consider a NullFunc frame as duplicate,
just like we do for QoS NullFunc frames.
