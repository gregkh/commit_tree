net/ipv4: Put target net when address dump fails due to bad attributes

If tgt_net is set based on IFA_TARGET_NETNSID attribute in the dump
request, make sure all error paths call put_net.

Fixes: 5fcd266a9f64 ("net/ipv4: Add support for dumping addresses for a specific device")
Fixes: c33078e3dfb1 ("net/ipv4: Update inet_dump_ifaddr for strict data checking")
