powerpc/64s/hash: remove the vmalloc segment from the bolted SLB

Remove the vmalloc segment from bolted SLBEs. This is not required to
be bolted, and seems like it was added to help pre-load the SLB on
context switch. However there are now other segments like the vmemmap
segment and non-zero node memory that often take misses after a context
switch, so it is better to solve this in a more general way.

A subsequent change will track free SLB entries and uses those rather
than round-robin overwrite valid entries, which makes it far less
likely for kernel SLBEs to be evicted after they are installed.
