xfs: support returning partial reflink results

Back when the XFS reflink code only supported clone_file_range, we were
only able to return zero or negative error codes to userspace.  However,
now that copy_file_range (which returns bytes copied) can use XFS'
clone_file_range, we have the opportunity to return partial results.
For example, if userspace sends a 1GB clone request and we run out of
space halfway through, we at least can tell userspace that we completed
512M of that request like a regular write.
