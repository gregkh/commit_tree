ubifs: Handle re-linking of inodes correctly while recovery

UBIFS's recovery code strictly assumes that a deleted inode will never
come back, therefore it removes all data which belongs to that inode
as soon it faces an inode with link count 0 in the replay list.
Before O_TMPFILE this assumption was perfectly fine. With O_TMPFILE
it can lead to data loss upon a power-cut.

Consider a journal with entries like:
0: inode X (nlink = 0) /* O_TMPFILE was created */
1: data for inode X /* Someone writes to the temp file */
2: inode X (nlink = 0) /* inode was changed, xattr, chmod, … */
3: inode X (nlink = 1) /* inode was re-linked via linkat() */

Upon replay of entry #2 UBIFS will drop all data that belongs to inode X,
this will lead to an empty file after mounting.

As solution for this problem, scan the replay list for a re-link entry
before dropping data.
