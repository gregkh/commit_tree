net/mlx5: Update mlx5_ifc with DEVX UID bits

Add DEVX information to WQ, SRQ, CQ, TIR, TIS, QP,
RQ, XRCD, PD, MKEY and MCG.

Each object that is created/destroyed/modified via verbs will
be stamped with a UID based on its user context. This is already
done for DEVX objects commands.

This will enable the firmware to enforce the usage of kernel objects
from the DEVX flow by validating that the same UID is used and the
resources are really related to the same user.

The addition of *_valid fields are needed to distinguish
how various addresses are passed.

For non-DEVX callers, all those fields will be zero.
