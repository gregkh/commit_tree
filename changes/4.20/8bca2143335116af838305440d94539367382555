scsi: esp_scsi: Eliminate ESP_FLAG_DOING_SLOWCMD

The concept of a 'slow command' as it appears in esp_scsi is confusing
because it could refer to an ESP command or a SCSI command. It turns out
that it refers to a particular ESP select command which the driver also
tracks as 'ESP_SELECT_MSGOUT'. For readability, it is better to use the
terminology from the datasheets.

The global ESP_FLAG_DOING_SLOWCMD flag is redundant anyway, as it can be
inferred from esp->select_state. Remove the ESP_FLAG_DOING_SLOWCMD cruft
and just use a boolean local variable.
