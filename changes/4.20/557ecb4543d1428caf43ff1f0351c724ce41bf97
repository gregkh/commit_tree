crypto: arm64/aes-blk - remove pointless (u8 *) casts

For some reason, the asmlinkage prototypes of the NEON routines take
u8[] arguments for the round key arrays, while the actual round keys
are arrays of u32, and so passing them into those routines requires
u8* casts at each occurrence. Fix that.
