net: mvpp2: rename the IRQs to match the hardware

This patch renames the IRQs in the Marvell PPv2 driver as their current
names match the way they are used in software. But this will change in
the future, and those IRQs have nothing to do with Rx/Tx interrupts
(this can be configured). The new binding also describe more interrupts
as some where left out.

The old binding support is kept for backward compatibility.
