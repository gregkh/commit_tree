rtlwifi: Removed unused define and code efuse_re_pg* from wifi.h

The following:
 bool efuse_re_pg_sec1flag;
 u8 efuse_re_pg_data[8];
are not referenced anywhere in the rtlwifi code.

This patch is originally created by Rick Veens <rickveens92@gmail.com>,
and Joe Perches <joe@perches.com> reminded to apply it to rtlwifi.
