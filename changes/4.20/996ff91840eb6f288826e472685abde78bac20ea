net: hns3: Fix for packet buffer setting bug

The hardware expects a unit of 128 bytes when setting
packet buffer. When calculating the packet buffer size,
hclge_rx_buffer_calc does not round up the size as a unit
of 128 byte, which may casue packet lost problem when stress
testing.

This patch fixes it by rounding up packet size when calculating.
