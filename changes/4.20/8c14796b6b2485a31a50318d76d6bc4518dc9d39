usb: xhci: tegra: Power-off power-domains on removal

Currently the XUSB power domains used by the Tegra xHCI controller are
never powered off on the removal of the driver, however, they will be
powered off on probe failure. Update the removal code to be consistent
with the probe failure path to power off the XUSB power domains.
