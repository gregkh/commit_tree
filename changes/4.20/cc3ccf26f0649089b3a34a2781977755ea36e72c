sctp: not allow to set asoc prsctp_enable by sockopt

As rfc7496#section4.5 says about SCTP_PR_SUPPORTED:

   This socket option allows the enabling or disabling of the
   negotiation of PR-SCTP support for future associations.  For existing
   associations, it allows one to query whether or not PR-SCTP support
   was negotiated on a particular association.

It means only sctp sock's prsctp_enable can be set.

Note that for the limitation of SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC, we will
add it when introducing SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC for linux
sctp in another patchset.

v1->v2:
  - drop the params.assoc_id check as Neil suggested.
