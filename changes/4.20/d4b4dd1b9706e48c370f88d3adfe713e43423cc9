RDMA/umem: Do not use current->tgid to track the mm_struct

This is just wrong, the process that calls into the reg_mr is the process
associated with the umem, and that does not have to be the same process
that created the context.

When this code was first written mmgrab() didn't exist, however these days
we can just directly hold the mm_struct pointer in the umem and have no
ambiguity when it comes to releasing the umem as to which mm it was
associated with.
