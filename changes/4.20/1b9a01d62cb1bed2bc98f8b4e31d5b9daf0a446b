drm/vmwgfx: Don't refcount cotable lookups during command buffer validation

The typical pattern of these lookups are
-Lookup
-Put on validate list if not already there.
-Unreference
And since we are the exclusive user of the context during lookup time,
we can be sure that the resource will stay alive during the sequence.
So avoid taking a reference during lookup, and also avoid unreferencing
when done. There are two users outside of command buffer validation and
those are refcounted explicitly.
