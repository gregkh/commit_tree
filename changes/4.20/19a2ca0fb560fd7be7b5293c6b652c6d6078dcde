arm64: lib: use C string functions with KASAN enabled

ARM64 has asm implementation of memchr(), memcmp(), str[r]chr(),
str[n]cmp(), str[n]len().  KASAN don't see memory accesses in asm code,
thus it can potentially miss many bugs.

Ifdef out __HAVE_ARCH_* defines of these functions when KASAN is enabled,
so the generic implementations from lib/string.c will be used.

We can't just remove the asm functions because efistub uses them.  And we
can't have two non-weak functions either, so declare the asm functions as
weak.
