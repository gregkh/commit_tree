pinctrl: Include <linux/gpio/driver.h> nothing else

These drivers are GPIO drivers, and the do not need to use the
legacy header in <linux/gpio.h>, go directly for
<linux/gpio/driver.h> instead.

Replace any use of GPIOF_* with 0/1, these flags are for
consumers, not drivers.

Get rid of a few gpio_to_irq() users that was littering
around the place, use local callbacks or avoid using it at
all.
