ARM: davinci: dm365: set the GPIO base to 0

Commit 587f7a694f01 ("gpio: davinci: Use dev name for label and
automatic base selection") broke the GPIO support on DaVinci boards
in legacy mode by allowing gpiolib to set the GPIO base automatically.

DaVinci board files use the legacy GPIO API with hard-coded GPIO line
numbers. Use the new fields in struct davinci_gpio_platform_data to
manually set the GPIO base to 0.
