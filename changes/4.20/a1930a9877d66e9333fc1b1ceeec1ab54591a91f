isdn: hfc_{pci,sx}: Avoid empty body if statements

Clang warns:

drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c:131:34: error: if statement has empty body
[-Werror,-Wempty-body]
        if (Read_hfc(cs, HFCPCI_INT_S1));
                                        ^
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c:131:34: note: put the semicolon on a
separate line to silence this warning

In my attempt to hide the warnings because I thought they didn't serve
any purpose[1], Masahiro Yamada pointed out that {Read,Write}_hfc in
hci_pci.c should be using a standard register access method; otherwise,
the compiler will just remove the if statements.

For hfc_pci, use the versions of {Read,Write}_hfc found in
drivers/isdn/hardware/mISDN/hfc_pCI.h while converting pci_io to be
'void __iomem *' (and clean up ioremap) then remove the empty if
statements.

For hfc_sx, {Read,Write}_hfc are already use a proper register accessor
(inb, outb) so just remove the unnecessary if statements.
