scsi: ufshcd: Fix NULL pointer dereference for in ufshcd_init

Error paths in ufshcd_init() ufshcd_hba_exit() killed clk_scaling workqueue
when the workqueue is actually created quite late in ufshcd_init().  So, we
end up getting NULL pointer dereference in such error paths.  Fix this by
moving clk_scaling initialization and kill codes to two separate methods, and
call them at required places.

Fixes: 401f1e4490ee ("scsi: ufs: don't suspend clock scaling during clock
gating")
