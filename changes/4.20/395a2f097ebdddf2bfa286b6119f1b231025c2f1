rcu: Define rcu_all_qs() only in !PREEMPT builds

Now that rcu_all_qs() is used only in !PREEMPT builds, move it to
tree_plugin.h so that it is defined only in those builds.  This in
turn means that rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle() is only used in !PREEMPT
builds, but it is simply marked __maybe_unused in order to keep it
near the rest of the dyntick-idle code.
