gpiolib: Implement fast processing path in get/set array

Certain GPIO descriptor arrays returned by gpio_get_array() may contain
information on direct mapping of array members to pins of a single GPIO
chip in hardware order.  In such cases, bitmaps of values can be passed
directly from/to the chip's .get/set_multiple() callbacks without
wasting time on iterations.

Add respective code to gpiod_get/set_array_bitmap_complex() functions.
Pins not applicable for fast path are processed as before, skipping
over the 'fast' ones.
