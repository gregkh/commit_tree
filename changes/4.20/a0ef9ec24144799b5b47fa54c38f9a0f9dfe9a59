rcu: Provide improved interrupt-from-idle check in rcu_check_callbacks()

The patch making need_resched() respond to urgent RCU-QS needs used
is_idle_task(current) to detect an interrupt from idle, which does work
reasonably, but is (in theory at least) vulnerable to loops containing
need_resched() invoked from within RCU_NONIDLE() or its tracepoint
equivalent.  This commit therefore moves rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle()
to a place from which rcu_check_callbacks() can invoke it and replaces
the is_idle_task(current) with rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle().
