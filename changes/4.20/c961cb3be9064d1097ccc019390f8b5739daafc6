of: Fix cpu node iterator to not ignore disabled cpu nodes

In most cases, nodes with 'status = "disabled";' are treated as if the
node is not present though it is a common bug to forget to check that.
However, cpu nodes are different in that "disabled" simply means offline
and the OS can bring the CPU core online. Commit f1f207e43b8a ("of: Add
cpu node iterator for_each_of_cpu_node()") followed the common behavior
of ignoring disabled cpu nodes. This breaks some powerpc systems (at
least NXP P50XX/e5500). Fix this by dropping the status check.
