selftests/bpf/test_progs: do not check errno == 0

The errno man page states: "The value in errno is significant only when
the return value of the call indicated an error..." then it is not correct
to check it, it could be different than zero even if the function
succeeded.

It causes some false positives if errno is set by a previous function.
