crypto: caam/qi2 - avoid double export

Both the caam ctrl file and dpaa2_caam export a couple of flags. They
use an #ifdef check to make sure that each flag is only built once,
but this fails if they are both loadable modules:

WARNING: drivers/crypto/caam/dpaa2_caam: 'caam_little_end' exported twice. Previous export was in drivers/crypto/caam/caam.ko
WARNING: drivers/crypto/caam/dpaa2_caam: 'caam_imx' exported twice. Previous export was in drivers/crypto/caam/caam.ko

Change the #ifdef to an IS_ENABLED() check in order to make it work in
all configurations. It may be better to redesign this aspect of the
two drivers in a cleaner way.
