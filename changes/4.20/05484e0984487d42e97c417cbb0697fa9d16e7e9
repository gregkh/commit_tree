sched/topology: Add SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY flag detection

The SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY sched_domain flag is supposed to mark the
sched_domain in the hierarchy where all CPU capacities are visible for
any CPU's point of view on asymmetric CPU capacity systems. The
scheduler can then take to take capacity asymmetry into account when
balancing at this level. It also serves as an indicator for how wide
task placement heuristics have to search to consider all available CPU
capacities as asymmetric systems might often appear symmetric at
smallest level(s) of the sched_domain hierarchy.

The flag has been around for while but so far only been set by
out-of-tree code in Android kernels. One solution is to let each
architecture provide the flag through a custom sched_domain topology
array and associated mask and flag functions. However,
SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY is special in the sense that it depends on the
capacity and presence of all CPUs in the system, i.e. when hotplugging
all CPUs out except those with one particular CPU capacity the flag
should disappear even if the sched_domains don't collapse. Similarly,
the flag is affected by cpusets where load-balancing is turned off.
Detecting when the flags should be set therefore depends not only on
topology information but also the cpuset configuration and hotplug
state. The arch code doesn't have easy access to the cpuset
configuration.

Instead, this patch implements the flag detection in generic code where
cpusets and hotplug state is already taken care of. All the arch is
responsible for is to implement arch_scale_cpu_capacity() and force a
full rebuild of the sched_domain hierarchy if capacities are updated,
e.g. later in the boot process when cpufreq has initialized.
