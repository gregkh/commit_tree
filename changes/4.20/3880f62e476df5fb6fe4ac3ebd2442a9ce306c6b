To be able to have both internal subdrivers and external bridge
drivers as output endpoints of vops, add a function to be able
to distinguish these.

changes in v8:
- improved function documentation
- better error handling
- put calls for node and pdev references
changes in v6:
- added function to check subdriver vs. bridge
