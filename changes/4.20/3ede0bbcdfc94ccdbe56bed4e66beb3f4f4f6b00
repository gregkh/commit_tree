ipv6: Allow the l3mdev to be a loopback

There is no way currently for an IPv6 client connect using a loopback
address in a VRF, whereas for IPv4 the loopback address can be added:

    $ sudo ip addr add dev vrfred 127.0.0.1/8
    $ sudo ip -6 addr add ::1/128 dev vrfred
    RTNETLINK answers: Cannot assign requested address

So allow ::1 to be configured on an L3 master device. In order for
this to be usable ip_route_output_flags needs to not consider ::1 to
be a link scope address (since oif == l3mdev and so it would be
dropped), and ipv6_rcv needs to consider the l3mdev to be a loopback
device so that it doesn't drop the packets.
