staging:rtl8192u: Lines should not end with a '(' - Style

A number of function prototypes cause a checkpatch issue - "Lines
should not end with a '(' ". This issue has been cleared by moving
function prototype parameters to the same line as the function name.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
