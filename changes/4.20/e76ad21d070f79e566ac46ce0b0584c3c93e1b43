net: ena: fix crash during failed resume from hibernation

During resume from hibernation if ena_restore_device fails,
ena_com_dev_reset() is called, and uses the readless read mechanism,
which was already destroyed by the call to
ena_com_mmio_reg_read_request_destroy(). This causes a NULL pointer
reference.

In this commit we switch the call order of the above two functions
to avoid this crash.
