usb: usbtmc: Optimize usbtmc_read

Use new usbtmc_generic_read function to maximize bandwidth
during long data transfer. Also fix reading of zero length
packet (ZLP) or trailing short packet.
The maximum input transfer size is limited to INT_MAX (=2GB).
Also remove redundant return in send_request_dev_dep_msg_in().
