ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Define new verbs and control params

This patch defines some new verbs found from reverse engineering of the
onboard 8051 CPU, and a control param found there as well. This clears
up usage of these verbs in other parts of the driver, and removes their
usage where they're now known to be unnecessary.
