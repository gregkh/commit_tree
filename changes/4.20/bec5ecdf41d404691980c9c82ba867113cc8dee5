ASoC: pxa: avoid AC97_BUS build warning

Selecting AC97_BUS_NEW from SND_PXA2XX_SOC_AC97 leads to a Kconfig
warning if any other driver selects AC97_BUS:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for AC97_BUS_COMPAT
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && AC97_BUS_NEW [=y] && !AC97_BUS [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_WM9713 [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && AC97_BUS_NEW [=y]

I don't know if that combination is supposed to work.
Assuming it is not, this adds a dependency on all users
for PXA to avoids the combination.
