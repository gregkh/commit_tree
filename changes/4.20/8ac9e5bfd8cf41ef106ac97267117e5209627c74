powerpc/xive: Use xive_cpu->chip_id instead of looking it up again

Function xive_native_get_ipi() might use chip_id without it being
initialized, if the CPU node is not found, as reported by smatch:

  error: uninitialized symbol 'chip_id'

As suggested by Cédric, we can use xc->chip_id instead of consulting
the device tree for chip id, which is safe since xive_prepare_cpu()
should have initialized ->chip_id by the time xive_native_get_ipi() is
called.
