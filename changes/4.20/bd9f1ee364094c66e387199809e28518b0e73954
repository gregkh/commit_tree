net: mvneta: reduce smp_processor_id() calling in mvneta_tx_done_gbe

In the loop of mvneta_tx_done_gbe(), we call the smp_processor_id()
each time, move the call out of the loop to optimize the code a bit.

Before the patch, the loop looks like(under arm64):

        ldr     x1, [x29,#120]
        ...
        ldr     w24, [x1,#36]
        ...
        bl      0 <_raw_spin_lock>
        str     w24, [x27,#132]
        ...

After the patch, the loop looks like(under arm64):

        ...
        bl      0 <_raw_spin_lock>
        str     w23, [x28,#132]
        ...
where w23 is loaded so be ready before the loop.

>From another side, mvneta_tx_done_gbe() is called from mvneta_poll()
which is in non-preemptible context, so it's safe to call the
smp_processor_id() function once.
