kernel/panic.c: filter out a potential trailing newline

If a call to panic() terminates the string with a \n , the result puts the
closing brace ']---' on a newline because panic() itself adds \n too.

Now, if one goes and removes the newline chars from all panic()
invocations - and the stats right now look like this:

~300 calls with a \n
~500 calls without a \n

one is destined to a neverending game of whack-a-mole because the usual
thing to do is add a newline at the end of a string a function is supposed
to print.

Therefore, simply zap any \n at the end of the panic string to avoid
touching so many places in the kernel.
