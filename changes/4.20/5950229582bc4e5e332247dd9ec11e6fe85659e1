ALSA: firewire-lib: add PCM rules to obsolete PCM constraints based on LCM of SYT_INTERVAL

In blocking mode of IEC 61883-1/6, when one isochronous packet includes
data for events, the data is for the same number of events as
SYT_INTERVAL decided according to sampling transmission frequency (SFC).

IEC 61883-1/6 engine of ALSA firewire stack applies constraints of
period and buffer size of PCM intermediate buffer of PCM substream.
At present, this constraint is designed to round the size up/down to
32 frames. This value comes from the least common multiple (LCM) of
SYT_INTERVAL. Although this looks to work well, in lower sampling
rate, applications are not allowed to set size of period quite near
period time constraint (at present 5 msec per period).

This commit adds PCM rules for period/buffer size and rate to obsoletes
the constraints based on LCM.
