perf augmented_syscalls: Update the header comments

Reflecting the fact that it now augments more than syscalls:sys_enter_SYSCALL
tracepoints that have filename strings as args. Also mention how the
extra data is handled by the by now modified 'perf trace' beautifiers,
that will use special "augmented" beautifiers when extra data is found
after the expected syscall enter/exit tracepoints.
