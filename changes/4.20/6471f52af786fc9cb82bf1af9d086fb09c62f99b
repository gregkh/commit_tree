alpha: switch to NO_BOOTMEM

Replace bootmem allocator with memblock and enable use of NO_BOOTMEM like
on most other architectures.

Alpha gets the description of the physical memory from the firmware as an
array of memory clusters.  Each cluster that is not reserved by the
firmware is added to memblock.memory.

Once the memblock.memory is set up, we reserve the kernel and initrd pages
with memblock reserve.

Since we don't need the bootmem bitmap anymore, the code that finds an
appropriate place is removed.

The conversion does not take care of NUMA support which is marked broken
for more than 10 years now.
