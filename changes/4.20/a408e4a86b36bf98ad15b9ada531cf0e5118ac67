ima: open a new file instance if no read permissions

Open a new file instance as opposed to changing file->f_mode when
the file is not readable.  This is done to accomodate overlayfs
stacked file operations change.  The real struct file is hidden
behind the overlays struct file.  So, any file->f_mode manipulations are
not reflected on the real struct file.  Open the file again in read mode
if original file cannot be read, read and calculate the hash.
