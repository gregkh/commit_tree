btrfs: change btrfs_free_reserved_bytes to return void

btrfs_free_reserved_bytes uses the variable "ret" for return value,
but it is not modified after initialzation. Further, I find that any of
the callers do not handle the return value, so it is safe to drop the
unneeded "ret" and return void. There are no callees that would need the
function to handle or pass the value either.
