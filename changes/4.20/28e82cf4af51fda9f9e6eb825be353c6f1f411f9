ARM: tegra: colibri_t30: pinmux clean-up

Clean-up pinmuxing:
- white-space clean-up
- explicitly disable LCD_M1 in favour of LCD_DE on L_BIAS
- explicitly disable multiplexed SSPFRM and SSPTXD
- get rid of nvidia,lock property
- add missing eMMC sdmmc4_cmd_pt7 and explicitly enable input
- explicitly disable lcd_dc1_pd2 (e.g. LM95245 I2C address pin)
- annotate TOUCH_PEN_INT# being on-module
- As underscores in node names are not recommended replace them all
  where possible with dashes.
- Replace underscores in UART annotations (e.g. UART_A) with dashes
  (e.g. UART-A) to be more in-line with our Colibri standard.
