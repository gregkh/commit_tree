libbpf: Introduce libbpf_attach_type_by_name

There is a common use-case when ELF object contains multiple BPF
programs and every program has its own section name. If it's cgroup-bpf
then programs have to be 1) loaded and 2) attached to a cgroup.

It's convenient to have information necessary to load BPF program
together with program itself. This is where section name works fine in
conjunction with libbpf_prog_type_by_name that identifies prog_type and
expected_attach_type and these can be used with BPF_PROG_LOAD.

But there is currently no way to identify attach_type by section name
and it leads to messy code in user space that reinvents guessing logic
every time it has to identify attach type to use with BPF_PROG_ATTACH.

The patch introduces libbpf_attach_type_by_name that guesses attach type
by section name if a program can be attached.

The difference between expected_attach_type provided by
libbpf_prog_type_by_name and attach_type provided by
libbpf_attach_type_by_name is the former is used at BPF_PROG_LOAD time
and can be zero if a program of prog_type X has only one corresponding
attach type Y whether the latter provides specific attach type to use
with BPF_PROG_ATTACH.

No new section names were added to section_names array. Only existing
ones were reorganized and attach_type was added where appropriate.
