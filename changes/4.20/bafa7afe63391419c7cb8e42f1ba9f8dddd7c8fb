libbpf: Support cgroup_skb/{e,in}gress section names

Add section names for BPF_CGROUP_INET_INGRESS and BPF_CGROUP_INET_EGRESS
attach types to be able to identify them in libbpf_attach_type_by_name.

"cgroup_skb" is used instead of "cgroup/skb" mostly to easy possible
unifying of how libbpf and bpftool works with section names:
* bpftool uses "cgroup_skb" to in "prog list" sub-command;
* bpftool uses "ingress" and "egress" in "cgroup list" sub-command;
* having two parts instead of three in a string like "cgroup_skb/ingress"
  can be leveraged to split it to prog_type part and attach_type part,
  or vise versa: use two parts to make a section name.
