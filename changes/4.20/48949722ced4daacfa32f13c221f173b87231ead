soundwire: Handle multiple master instances in a stream

For each SoundWire stream operation, we need to parse master
list and operate upon all master runtime.

This is a preparatory patch to do the boilerplate conversion
of stream handling from single master runtime to handle a
list of master runtime. The code to support bank switch for
multiple master instances is added in the next patch.
