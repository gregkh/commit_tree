net: hns3: Clear mac vlan table entries when unload driver or function reset

In original codes, the mac vlan table entries are not cleared when
unload hns3 driver. The dirty mac vlan table entries will make the
result of looking up mac vlan table being unexpected.

When doing core reset or global reset, the firmware will clear all
the tables for driver, and driver shouldn't send any commands to
firmware during reset. But when doing function reset, the driver
needs to clear the tables itself.

This patch clears the mac vlan table entries for each client when
unload driver or reset.
