arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Orange Pi Win: Enable USB OTG socket

The Orange Pi Win has a micro USB-B socket, connected to the SoC's
USB-OTG port. Its power is supplied by the AXP PMIC, and the ID pin is
connected to GPIO PH9. It can serve both as a host or a client port.

Add the respective DT nodes to enable it.
