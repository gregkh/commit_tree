Bluetooth: Remove redundant check on status

The check on status is redundant as a status has to be zero at
the point it is being checked because of a previous check and return
path via label 'unlock'.  Remove the redundant check and the deadcode
that can never be reached.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1471710 ("Logically dead code")
