xtensa: fix coprocessor context offset definitions

Coprocessor context offsets are used by the assembly code that moves
coprocessor context between the individual fields of the
thread_info::xtregs_cp structure and coprocessor registers.
This fixes coprocessor context clobbering on flushing and reloading
during normal user code execution and user process debugging in the
presence of more than one coprocessor in the core configuration.
