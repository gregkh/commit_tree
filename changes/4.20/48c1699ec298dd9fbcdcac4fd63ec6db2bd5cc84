net: qca_spi: Introduce write register verification

The SPI protocol for the QCA7000 doesn't have any fault detection.
In order to increase the drivers reliability in noisy environments,
we could implement a write verification inspired by the enc28j60.
This should avoid situations were the driver wrongly assumes the
receive interrupt is enabled and miss all incoming packets.

This function is disabled per default and can be controlled via module
parameter wr_verify.
