powerpc/mm/book3s: Check for pmd_large instead of pmd_trans_huge

Update few code paths to check for pmd_large.

set_pmd_at:
We want to use this to store swap pte at pmd level. For swap ptes we don't want
to set H_PAGE_THP_HUGE. Hence check for pmd_large in set_pmd_at. This remove
the false WARN_ON when using this with swap pmd entry.

pmd_page:
We don't really use them on pmd migration entries. But they can also work with
migration entries and we don't differentiate at the pte level. Hence update
pmd_page to work with pmd migration entries too

__find_linux_pte:
lockless page table walk need to handle pmd migration entries. pmd_trans_huge
check will return false on them. We don't set thp = 1 for such entries, but
update hpage_shift correctly. Without this we will walk pmd migration entries
as a pte page pointer which is wrong.
