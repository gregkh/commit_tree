staging: most: use format specifier "%s" in snprintf

Passing string ch_data_type[i].name as the format specifier is
potentially hazardous because it could (although very unlikely to)
have a format specifier embedded in it causing issues when parsing
the non-existent arguments to these.  Follow best practice by using
the "%s" format string for the string.

Cleans up clang warning:
format string is not a string literal (potentially insecure) [-Wformat-security]
