spi: fsl-lpspi: Prevent FIFO under/overrun by default

Certain devices don't work well when a transmit FIFO underrun or
receive FIFO overrun occurs. Example is the SAF400x radio chip when
running at high speed which leads to garbage being sent to/received from
the chip. In which case, it should stall waiting for further data to be
available before proceeding. This patch unset the NOSTALL bit in CFGR1
by default to prevent this issue.
