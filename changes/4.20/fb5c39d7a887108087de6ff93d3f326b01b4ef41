btrfs: don't use ctl->free_space for max_extent_size

max_extent_size is supposed to be the largest contiguous range for the
space info, and ctl->free_space is the total free space in the block
group.  We need to keep track of these separately and _only_ use the
max_free_space if we don't have a max_extent_size, as that means our
original request was too large to search any of the block groups for and
therefore wouldn't have a max_extent_size set.
