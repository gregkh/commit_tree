KVM: nVMX: vmcs12 revision_id is always VMCS12_REVISION even when copied from eVMCS

vmcs12 represents the per-CPU cache of L1 active vmcs12.

This cache can be loaded by one of the following:
1) Guest making a vmcs12 active by exeucting VMPTRLD
2) Guest specifying eVMCS in VP assist page and executing
VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME.

Either way, vmcs12 should have revision_id of VMCS12_REVISION.
Which is not equal to eVMCS revision_id which specifies used
VersionNumber of eVMCS struct (e.g. KVM_EVMCS_VERSION).

Specifically, this causes an issue in restoring a nested VM state
because vmx_set_nested_state() verifies that vmcs12->revision_id
is equal to VMCS12_REVISION which was not true in case vmcs12
was populated from an eVMCS by vmx_get_nested_state() which calls
copy_enlightened_to_vmcs12().
