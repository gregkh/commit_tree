of/device: Really only set bus DMA mask when appropriate

of_dma_configure() was *supposed* to be following the same logic as
acpi_dma_configure() and only setting bus_dma_mask if some range was
specified by the firmware. However, it seems that subtlety got lost in
the process of fitting it into the differently-shaped control flow, and
as a result the force_dma==true case ends up always setting the bus mask
to the 32-bit default, which is not what anyone wants.

Make sure we only touch it if the DT actually said so.
