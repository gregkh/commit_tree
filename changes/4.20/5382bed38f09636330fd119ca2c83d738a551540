drm/i915/selftests: ring all doorbells in igt_guc_doorbells

We currently verify that all doorbells can be registered with GuC and
HW but don't check that all works as expected after a db ring.

Do a nop ring of all doorbells to make sure we haven't misprogrammed
any WQ or stage descriptor data. This will also help validating
upcoming changes in the db programming flow.
