kvm: x86: Add AMD's EX_CFG to the list of ignored MSRs

Some guests OSes (including Windows 10) write to MSR 0xc001102c
on some cases (possibly while trying to apply a CPU errata).
Make KVM ignore reads and writes to that MSR, so the guest won't
crash.

The MSR is documented as "Execution Unit Configuration (EX_CFG)",
at AMD's "BIOS and Kernel Developer's Guide (BKDG) for AMD Family
15h Models 00h-0Fh Processors".
