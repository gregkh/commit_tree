staging: gasket: page_table: simplify gasket_components_to_dev_address

Refactor gasket_components_to_dev_address to be faster and easier to
understand. The old implementation was unnecessarily complex and masked
the page_index for simple addresses but not extended ones. It makes the
most sense for this function to perform no such masking.
