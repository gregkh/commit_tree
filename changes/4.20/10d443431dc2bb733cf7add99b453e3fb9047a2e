ARC: io.h: Implement reads{x}()/writes{x}()

Some ARC CPU's do not support unaligned loads/stores. Currently, generic
implementation of reads{b/w/l}()/writes{b/w/l}() is being used with ARC.
This can lead to misfunction of some drivers as generic functions do a
plain dereference of a pointer that can be unaligned.

Let's use {get/put}_unaligned() helpers instead of plain dereference of
pointer in order to fix. The helpers allow to get and store data from an
unaligned address whilst preserving the CPU internal alignment.
According to [1], the use of these helpers are costly in terms of
performance so we added an initial check for a buffer already aligned so
that the usage of the helpers can be avoided, when possible.
