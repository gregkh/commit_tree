blkcg: fix edge case for blk_get_rl() under memory pressure

It is possible for blkg creation to fail when in blk_get_rl(). In this
situation, the fallback logic returns the nearest created blkg. There is
however special handling for the request_list for the root blkcg. This
fixes the missing edge case from the earlier series changing
blk_get_rl().
