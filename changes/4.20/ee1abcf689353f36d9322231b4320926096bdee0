ipv6/ndisc: Preserve IPv6 control buffer if protocol error handlers are called

Commit a61bbcf28a8c ("[NET]: Store skb->timestamp as offset to a base
timestamp") introduces a neighbour control buffer and zeroes it out in
ndisc_rcv(), as ndisc_recv_ns() uses it.

Commit f2776ff04722 ("[IPV6]: Fix address/interface handling in UDP and
DCCP, according to the scoping architecture.") introduces the usage of the
IPv6 control buffer in protocol error handlers (e.g. inet6_iif() in
present-day __udp6_lib_err()).

Now, with commit b94f1c0904da ("ipv6: Use icmpv6_notify() to propagate
redirect, instead of rt6_redirect()."), we call protocol error handlers
from ndisc_redirect_rcv(), after the control buffer is already stolen and
some parts are already zeroed out. This implies that inet6_iif() on this
path will always return zero.

This gives unexpected results on UDP socket lookup in __udp6_lib_err(), as
we might actually need to match sockets for a given interface.

Instead of always claiming the control buffer in ndisc_rcv(), do that only
when needed.
