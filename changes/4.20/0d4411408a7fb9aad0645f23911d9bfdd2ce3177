net: hns3: bugfix for reporting unknown vector0 interrupt repeatly problem

The current driver supports handling two vector0 interrupts, reset and
mailbox. When the hardware reports an interrupt of another type of
interrupt source, if the driver does not process the interrupt, but
enables the interrupt, the hardware will repeatedly report the unknown
interrupt.

Therefore, the driver enables the vector0 interrupt after clearing the
known type of interrupt source. Other conditions are not enabled.
