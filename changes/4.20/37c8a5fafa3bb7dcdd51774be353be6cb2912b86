kbuild: consolidate Devicetree dtb build rules

There is nothing arch specific about building dtb files other than their
location under /arch/*/boot/dts/. Keeping each arch aligned is a pain.
The dependencies and supported targets are all slightly different.
Also, a cross-compiler for each arch is needed, but really the host
compiler preprocessor is perfectly fine for building dtbs. Move the
build rules to a common location and remove the arch specific ones. This
is done in a single step to avoid warnings about overriding rules.

The build dependencies had been a mixture of 'scripts' and/or 'prepare'.
These pull in several dependencies some of which need a target compiler
(specifically devicetable-offsets.h) and aren't needed to build dtbs.
All that is really needed is dtc, so adjust the dependencies to only be
dtc.

This change enables support 'dtbs_install' on some arches which were
missing the target.
