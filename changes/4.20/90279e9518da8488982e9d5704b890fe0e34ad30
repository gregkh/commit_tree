drm/omap: Don't call EDID read operation recursively

Instead of calling the EDID read operation (.read_edid()) recursively
from the display device back to the first device that provides EDID read
support, iterate over the devices manually in the DRM connector code.
This moves the complexity to a single central location and simplifies
the logic in omap_dss_device drivers.
