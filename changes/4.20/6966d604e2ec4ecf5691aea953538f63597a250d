s390/mem_detect: move tprot loop to early boot phase

Move memory detection to early boot phase. To store online memory
regions "struct mem_detect_info" has been introduced together with
for_each_mem_detect_block iterator. mem_detect_info is later converted
to memblock.

Also introduces sclp_early_get_meminfo function to get maximum physical
memory and maximum increment number.
