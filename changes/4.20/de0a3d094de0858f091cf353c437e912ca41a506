drm/msm: re-factor devfreq code

The devfreq framework requires the drivers to provide busy time estimations.
The GPU driver relies on the hardware performance counteres for the busy time
estimations, but different hardware revisions have counters which can be
sourced from different clocks. So the busy time estimation will be target
dependent.  Additionally on targets where the clocks are completely controlled
by the on chip microcontroller, fetching and setting the current GPU frequency
will be different. This patch aims to embrace these differences by re-factoring
the devfreq code a bit.
