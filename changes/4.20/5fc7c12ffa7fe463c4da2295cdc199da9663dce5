bnxt_en: Remove unnecessary unsigned integer comparison and initialize variable

There is no need to compare *val.vu32* with < 0 because
such variable is of type u32 (32 bits, unsigned), making it
impossible to hold a negative value. Fix this by removing
such comparison.

Also, initialize variable *max_val* to -1, just in case
it is not initialized to either BNXT_MSIX_VEC_MAX or
BNXT_MSIX_VEC_MIN_MAX before using it in a comparison
with val.vu32 at line 159:

	if (val.vu32 > max_val)
