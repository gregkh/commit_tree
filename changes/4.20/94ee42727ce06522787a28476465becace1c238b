powerpc/64s/hash: Simplify slb_flush_and_rebolt()

slb_flush_and_rebolt() is misleading, it is called in virtual mode, so
it can not possibly change the stack, so it should not be touching the
shadow area. And since vmalloc is no longer bolted, it should not
change any bolted mappings at all.

Change the name to slb_flush_and_restore_bolted(), and have it just
load the kernel stack from what's currently in the shadow SLB area.
