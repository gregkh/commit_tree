ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Add AE-5 pre-init and ca0113 functions

This patch adds AE-5 pre-init functions that happen before the main
ca0132_alt_init, and gives functions related to the ca0113 a ca0113
prefix instead of ca0132. It also adds functions to write to the 8051's
SFRs, and to write the special ca0113 commands for the AE-5.
