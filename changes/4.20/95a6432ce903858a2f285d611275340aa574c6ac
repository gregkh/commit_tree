KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Streamlined guest entry/exit path on P9 for radix guests

This creates an alternative guest entry/exit path which is used for
radix guests on POWER9 systems when we have indep_threads_mode=Y.  In
these circumstances there is exactly one vcpu per vcore and there is
no coordination required between vcpus or vcores; the vcpu can enter
the guest without needing to synchronize with anything else.

The new fast path is implemented almost entirely in C in book3s_hv.c
and runs with the MMU on until the guest is entered.  On guest exit
we use the existing path until the point where we are committed to
exiting the guest (as distinct from handling an interrupt in the
low-level code and returning to the guest) and we have pulled the
guest context from the XIVE.  At that point we check a flag in the
stack frame to see whether we came in via the old path and the new
path; if we came in via the new path then we go back to C code to do
the rest of the process of saving the guest context and restoring the
host context.

The C code is split into separate functions for handling the
OS-accessible state and the hypervisor state, with the idea that the
latter can be replaced by a hypercall when we implement nested
virtualization.
