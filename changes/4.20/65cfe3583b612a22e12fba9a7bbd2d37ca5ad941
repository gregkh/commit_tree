rcu: Define RCU-bh update API in terms of RCU

Now that the main RCU API knows about softirq disabling and softirq's
quiescent states, the RCU-bh update code can be dispensed with.
This commit therefore removes the RCU-bh update-side implementation and
defines RCU-bh's update-side API in terms of that of either RCU-preempt or
RCU-sched, depending on the setting of the CONFIG_PREEMPT Kconfig option.

In kernels built with CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y this has the knock-on effect
of reducing by one the number of rcuo kthreads per CPU.
