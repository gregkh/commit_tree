staging:rtl8192u: Refactor BA_PARAM_SET - Style

Refactor the union BA_PARAM_SET, firstly removing the 'typedef', this
clears the checkpatch issue with defining new types. Secondly the union
is renamed to lowercase to comply with the coding standard.

These are coding style changes which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
