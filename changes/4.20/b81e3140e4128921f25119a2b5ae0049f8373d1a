firmware: coreboot: Make bus registration symmetric

The bus is registered in module_init() but is unregistered when the
platform driver remove() function calls coreboot_table_exit(). That
isn't symmetric and it causes the bus to appear on systems that compile
this code in, even when there isn't any coreboot firmware on the device.
Let's move the registration to the coreboot_table_init() function so
that it matches the exit path.
