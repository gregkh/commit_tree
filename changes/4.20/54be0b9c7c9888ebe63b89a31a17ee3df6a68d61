Revert "convert SLB miss handlers to C" and subsequent commits

This reverts commits:
  5e46e29e6a97 ("powerpc/64s/hash: convert SLB miss handlers to C")
  8fed04d0f6ae ("powerpc/64s/hash: remove user SLB data from the paca")
  655deecf67b2 ("powerpc/64s/hash: SLB allocation status bitmaps")
  2e1626744e8d ("powerpc/64s/hash: provide arch_setup_exec hooks for hash slice setup")

This series had a few bugs, and the fixes are not all trivial. So
revert most of it for now.
