x86/vsmp: Remove dependency on pv_irq_ops

vSMP dependency on pv_irq_ops has been removed some years ago, but the code
still deals with pv_irq_ops.

In short, "cap & ctl & (1 << 4)" is always returning 0, so all
PARAVIRT/PARAVIRT_XXL code related to that can be removed.

However, the rest of the code depends on CONFIG_PCI, so fix it accordingly.

Rename set_vsmp_pv_ops to set_vsmp_ctl as the original name does not make
sense anymore.
