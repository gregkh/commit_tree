drm/msm: dpu: Move atomic_check_plane_state() call to atomic_check

src/dst rects are checked in both atomic_check and atomic_update, with
the more comprehensive check occurring in atomic_update, which is
backwards. So consolodate the checks in atomic_check.

Changes in v2:
- Use the correct crtc state (Jeykumar)
