media: rename soc_camera I2C drivers

Those drivers are part of the legacy SoC camera framework.
They're being converted to not use it, but sometimes we're
keeping both legacy any new driver.

This time, for example, we have two drivers on media with
the same name: ov772x. That's bad.

So, in order to prevent that to happen, let's prepend the SoC
legacy drivers with soc_.

No functional changes.
