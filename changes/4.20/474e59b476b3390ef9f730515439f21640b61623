rcutorture: Check GP completion at stutter end

The rcu_torture_writer() function invokes stutter_wait() at the end of
each writer pass, which occasionally blocks for an extended time period
in order to ensure that RCU can handle intermittent loads.  But part of
handling a busy period is invoking all the callbacks before the end of
the idle period induced by stutter_wait().

This commit therefore adds a return value to stutter_wait() indicating
whether stutter_wait() actually waited.  In addition, this commit causes
rcu_torture_writer() to test this value and if set, checks that all the
elements of the rcu_tortures[] array have been freed up.
