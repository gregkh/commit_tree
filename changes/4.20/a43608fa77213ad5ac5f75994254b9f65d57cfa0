can: raw: check for CAN FD capable netdev in raw_sendmsg()

When the socket is CAN FD enabled it can handle CAN FD frame
transmissions.  Add an additional check in raw_sendmsg() as a CAN2.0 CAN
driver (non CAN FD) should never see a CAN FD frame. Due to the commonly
used can_dropped_invalid_skb() function the CAN 2.0 driver would drop
that CAN FD frame anyway - but with this patch the user gets a proper
-EINVAL return code.
