perf bpf: Add linux/socket.h to the headers accessible to bpf proggies

So that we don't have to define sockaddr_storage in the
augmented_syscalls.c bpf example when hooking into syscalls needing it,
idea is to mimic the system headers. Eventually we probably need to have
sys/socket.h, etc.  Start by having at least linux/socket.h.
