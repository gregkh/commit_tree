arm64: dts: sdm845-mtp: Reserve reserved gpios

With the introduction of commit 3edfb7bd76bd ("gpiolib: Show correct
direction from the beginning") the gpiolib will attempt to read the
direction of all pins, which triggers a read from protected register
regions.

The pins 0 through 3 and 81 through 84 are protected, so mark these as
reserved.
