powerpc/mm/thp: update pmd_trans_huge to check for pmd_present

We need to make sure pmd_trans_huge returns false for a pmd migration entry.
We mark the migration entry by clearing the _PAGE_PRESENT bit. We keep the
_PAGE_PTE bit set to indicate a leaf page table entry. Hence we need to make
sure we check for pmd_present() so that pmd_trans_huge won't return true on
pmd migration entry.
