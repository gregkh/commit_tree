perf scripts python: exported-sql-viewer.py: Add support for multiple sub-windows

Use Qt MDI (multiple document interface) to support multiple sub-windows.
Put the data model in a cache so that each sub-window can share the same
data. This allows mutiple views of the call-graph at the same time and
paves the way to add more reports.

Committer testing:

Starts with a "File  Reports  Windows" main menu, from the "Reports" I
can get what was available up to now, the "Context-Sensitivi Call Graph"
option.
