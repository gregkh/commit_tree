hwmon: (scmi) Remove redundant pointer check

Clang warns when the address of a pointer is used in a boolean context
as it will always return true.

drivers/hwmon/scmi-hwmon.c:59:24: warning: address of array
'sensor->name' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (sensor && sensor->name)
                   ~~ ~~~~~~~~^~~~
1 warning generated.

Remove the check as it isn't doing anything currently; if validation
of the contents of the data structure was intended by the original
author (since this line has been present from the first version of
this driver), it can be added in a follow-up patch.
