net: common metrics init helper for FIB entries

Consolidate initialization of ipv4 and ipv6 metrics when fib entries
are created into a single helper, ip_fib_metrics_init, that handles
the call to ip_metrics_convert.

If no metrics are defined for the fib entry, then the metrics is set
to dst_default_metrics.
