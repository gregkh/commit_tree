net: aquantia: fix rx checksum offload bits

The last set of csum offload fixes had a leak:

Checksum enabled status bits from rx descriptor were incorrectly
interpreted. Consequently all the other valid logic worked on zero bits.
That caused rx checksum offloads never to trigger.

Tested by dumping rx descriptors and validating resulting csum_level.
