irqchip/gic-v3: Remove acknowledge loop

Multiple interrupts pending for a CPU is actually rare. Doing an
acknowledge loop does not give much better performance or even can
deteriorate them.

Do not loop when an interrupt has been acknowledged, just return
from interrupt and wait for another one to be raised.
