KVM: LAPIC: Tune lapic_timer_advance_ns automatically

In cloud environment, lapic_timer_advance_ns is needed to be tuned for every CPU
generations, and every host kernel versions(the kvm-unit-tests/tscdeadline_latency.flat
is 5700 cycles for upstream kernel and 9600 cycles for our 3.10 product kernel,
both preemption_timer=N, Skylake server).

This patch adds the capability to automatically tune lapic_timer_advance_ns
step by step, the initial value is 1000ns as 'commit d0659d946be0 ("KVM: x86:
add option to advance tscdeadline hrtimer expiration")' recommended, it will be
reduced when it is too early, and increased when it is too late. The guest_tsc
and tsc_deadline are hard to equal, so we assume we are done when the delta
is within a small scope e.g. 100 cycles. This patch reduces latency
(kvm-unit-tests/tscdeadline_latency, busy waits, preemption_timer enabled)
from ~2600 cyles to ~1200 cyles on our Skylake server.
