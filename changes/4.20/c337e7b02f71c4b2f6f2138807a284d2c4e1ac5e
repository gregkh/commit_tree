btrfs: qgroup: Introduce trace event to analyse the number of dirty extents accounted

Number of qgroup dirty extents is directly linked to the performance
overhead, so add a new trace event, trace_qgroup_num_dirty_extents(), to
record how many dirty extents is processed in
btrfs_qgroup_account_extents().

This will be pretty handy to analyze later balance performance
improvement.
