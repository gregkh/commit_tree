bpf: allow offload of programs with BPF-to-BPF function calls

Now that there is at least one driver supporting BPF-to-BPF function
calls, lift the restriction, in the verifier, on hardware offload of
eBPF programs containing such calls. But prevent jit_subprogs(), still
in the verifier, from being run for offloaded programs.
