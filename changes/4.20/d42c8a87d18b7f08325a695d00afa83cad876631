smb3: do not display confusing message on mount to Azure servers

Some servers (e.g. Azure) return "STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED" rather
than "STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST" on query network interface
info at mount.  This shouldn't cause us to log a warning message
automatically.  Don't log this unless noisier cifsFYI is enabled.
