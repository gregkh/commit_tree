usb: dwc2: fix a race with external vbus supply

There's a race with root hub resume, when using external vbus supply.
Root hub gets resumed, but runtime pm autosuspend runs as external vbus
supply isn't enabled. So, host never exit from power down properly.
Initialize vbus external supply before, rater that after hub resume.

Fixes: 531ef5ebea96 ("usb: dwc2: add support for host mode external
vbus supply")
