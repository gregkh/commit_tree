usb: iowarrior: replace kmalloc with kmalloc_array

A common flaw in the kernel is integer overflow during memory allocation
size calculations. In an effort to reduce the frequency of these bugs,
kmalloc_array was implemented, which allocates memory for an array,
while at the same time detects integer overflow.

This patch replaces cases of:

	kmalloc(a * b, gfp)

with:
	kmalloc_array(a, b, gfp)
