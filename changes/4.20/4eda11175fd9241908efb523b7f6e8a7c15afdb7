efi/x86: drop task_lock() from efi_switch_mm()

efi_switch_mm() is a wrapper around switch_mm() which saves current's
->active_mm, sets the requests mm as ->active_mm and invokes
switch_mm().
I don't think that task_lock() is required during that procedure. It
protects ->mm which isn't changed here.

It needs to be mentioned that during the whole procedure (switch to
EFI's mm and back) the preemption needs to be disabled. A context switch
at this point would reset the cr3 value based on current->mm. Also, this
function may not be invoked at the same time on a different CPU because
it would overwrite the efi_scratch.prev_mm information.

Remove task_lock() and also update the comment to reflect it.
