crypto: arm64/aes-modes - get rid of literal load of addend vector

Replace the literal load of the addend vector with a sequence that
performs each add individually. This sequence is only 2 instructions
longer than the original, and 2% faster on Cortex-A53.

This is an improvement by itself, but also works around a Clang issue,
whose integrated assembler does not implement the GNU ARM asm syntax
completely, and does not support the =literal notation for FP registers
