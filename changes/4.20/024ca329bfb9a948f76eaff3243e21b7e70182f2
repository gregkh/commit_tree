serial: uartps: Register own uart console and driver structures

Every instance is registering own struct console and struct uart_driver
with minor number which corresponds to alias ID (or 0 now) and with 1 uart
port. The same alias ID is saved to tty_driver->name_base which is key
field for creating ttyPSX name.

Because name_base and minor number are setup already there is no need to
setup any port->line number because 0 is the right value.

Unfortunately this driver is setting up major number to 0 for using
dynamic assignment and kernel is allocating different major numbers for
every instance instead of using the same major and different minor
number.

~# ls -la /dev/ttyPS*
crw-------    1 root     root      252,   0 Jan  1 03:36 /dev/ttyPS0
crw--w----    1 root     root      253,   1 Jan  1 00:00 /dev/ttyPS1

When major number is not 0. For example 252 then major/minor
combinations are in expected form

~# ls -la /dev/ttyPS*
crw-------    1 root     root      252,   0 Jan  1 04:04 /dev/ttyPS0
crw--w----    1 root     root      252,   1 Jan  1 00:00 /dev/ttyPS1

Driver is not freeing struct cdns_uart_console in case that instance is
not used as console. The reason is that console is incorrectly unregistred
and "console [0] disabled" message will be shown.
