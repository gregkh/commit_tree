usb: usbtmc: Remove sysfs group TermChar and auto_abort

As all the properties of the usbtmc driver can now be
controlled on a per file descriptor basis by ioctl functions
the sysfs interface is of limited use.
We are not aware about applications that are using the sysfs
parameter TermChar, TermCharEnabled or auto_abort.
