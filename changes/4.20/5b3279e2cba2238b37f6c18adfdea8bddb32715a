Revert "net/ibm/emac: wrong bit is used for STA control"

This reverts commit 624ca9c33c8a853a4a589836e310d776620f4ab9.

This commit is completely bogus. The STACR register has two formats, old
and new, depending on the version of the IP block used. There's a pair of
device-tree properties that can be used to specify the format used:

	has-inverted-stacr-oc
	has-new-stacr-staopc

What this commit did was to change the bit definition used with the old
parts to match the new parts. This of course breaks the driver on all
the old ones.

Instead, the author should have set the appropriate properties in the
device-tree for the variant used on his board.
