nvmem: resolve cells from DT at registration time

Currently we're creating a new cell structure everytime a DT user
calls nvmem_cell_get().

Change this behavior by resolving the cells during nvmem provider
registration and adding all cells to the provider's list. Make
of_nvmem_cell_get() just parse the phandle and look the cell up
in the relevant provider's list.

Don't drop the cell in nvmem_cell_put().
