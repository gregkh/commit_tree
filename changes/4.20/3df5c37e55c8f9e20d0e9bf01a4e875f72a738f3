KVM: nVMX: try to set EFER bits correctly when initializing controls

VM_ENTRY_IA32E_MODE and VM_{ENTRY,EXIT}_LOAD_IA32_EFER will be
explicitly set/cleared as needed by vmx_set_efer(), but attempt
to get the bits set correctly when intializing the control fields.
Setting the value correctly can avoid multiple VMWrites.
