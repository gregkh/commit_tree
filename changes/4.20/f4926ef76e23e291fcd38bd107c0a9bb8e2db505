soc: qcom: geni: Make version macros simpler

This macro doesn't work, because it hides a local variable inside of the
macro to hold the version and that variable name is called 'ver' and
'version' sometimes.

Let's change this to be more explicit. Introduce three macros for the
major, minor, and step of the version, and require callers to pass the
version in to get the part of the version out. This way we don't hide
local variables inside macros and things are less evil overall.
