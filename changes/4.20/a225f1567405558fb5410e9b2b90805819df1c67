powerpc/ptrace: replace ptrace_report_syscall() with a tracehook call

Arch code should use tracehook_*() helpers, as documented in
include/linux/tracehook.h, ptrace_report_syscall() is not expected to
be used outside that file.

The patch does not look very nice, but at least it is correct
and opens the way for PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO API.
