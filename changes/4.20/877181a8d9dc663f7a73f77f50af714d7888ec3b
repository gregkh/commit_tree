selinux: fix non-MLS handling in mls_context_to_sid()

Commit 95ffe194204a ("selinux: refactor mls_context_to_sid() and make
it stricter") inadvertently changed how we handle labels that did not
contain MLS information.  This patch restores the proper behavior in
mls_context_to_sid() and adds a comment explaining the proper
behavior to help ensure this doesn't happen again.
