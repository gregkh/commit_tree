net/ipv6: Plumb support for filtering route dumps

Implement kernel side filtering of routes by table id, egress device
index, protocol, and route type. If the table id is given in the filter,
lookup the table and call fib6_dump_table directly for it.

Move the existing route flags check for prefix only routes to the new
filter.
