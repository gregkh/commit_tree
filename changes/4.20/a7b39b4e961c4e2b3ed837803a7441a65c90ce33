blkcg: always associate a bio with a blkg

Previously, blkg's were only assigned as needed by blk-iolatency and
blk-throttle. bio->css was also always being associated while blkg was
being looked up and then thrown away in blkcg_bio_issue_check.

This patch begins the cleanup of bio->css and bio->bi_blkg by always
associating a blkg in blkcg_bio_issue_check. This tries to create the
blkg, but if it is not possible, falls back to using the root_blkg of
the request_queue. Therefore, a bio will always be associated with a
blkg. The duplicate association logic is removed from blk-throttle and
blk-iolatency.
