arm64: dts: renesas: revise properties for R-Car Gen3 SoCs' usb 2.0

R-Car Gen3 SoCs need to enable/deassert clocks/resets of both usb 2.0
host (included phy) and peripheral. Otherwise, other side device
cannot work correctly. So, this patch revises properties of clocks
and resets. After that, each device driver can enable/deassert
clocks/resets by its self.

Notes:
 - To work the renesas_usbhs driver correctly when host side drivers
   are disabled and the renesas_usbhs driver doesn't have multiple
   clock management, this patch doesn't change the order of the clocks
   property in each hsusb node.
 - This patch doesn't have any side-effects even if the renesas_usbhs
   driver doesn't have reset_control and multiple clock management.
