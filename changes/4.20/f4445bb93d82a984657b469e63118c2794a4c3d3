scsi: hisi_sas: Fix NULL pointer dereference

There is a NULL pointer dereference in case *slot* happens to be NULL at
lines 1053 and 1878:

struct hisi_sas_cq *cq =
	&hisi_hba->cq[slot->dlvry_queue];

Notice that *slot* is being NULL checked at lines 1057 and 1881:
if (slot), which implies it may be NULL.

Fix this by placing the declaration and definition of variable cq, which
contains the pointer dereference slot->dlvry_queue, after slot has been
properly NULL checked.
