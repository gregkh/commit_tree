net: bridge: add bitfield for options and convert vlan opts

Bridge options have usually been added as separate fields all over the
net_bridge struct taking up space and ending up in different cache lines.
Let's move them to a single bitfield to save up space and speedup lookups.
This patch adds a simple API for option modifying and retrieving using
bitops and converts the first user of the API - the bridge vlan options
(vlan_enabled and vlan_stats_enabled).
