drm/amd/display: Use DRM helper for best_encoder

[Why]
Our implementation is functionally identical to DRM's

Note that instead of checking if the provided id is 0, the helper
follows through with the mode object search. However, It will still
return NULL, since 0 is not a valid object id, and missed searches
will return NULL.

[How]
Remove our implementation, and replace it with
drm_atomic_helper_best_encoder.
