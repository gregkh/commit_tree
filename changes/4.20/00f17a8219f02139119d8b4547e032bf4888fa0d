net: ena: fix compilation error in xtensa architecture

linux/prefetch.h is never explicitly included in ena_com, although
functions from it, such as prefetchw(), are used throughout ena_com.
This is an inclusion bug, and we fix it here by explicitly including
linux/prefetch.h. The bug was exposed when the driver was compiled
for the xtensa architecture.
