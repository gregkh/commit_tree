f2fs: fix to recover inode's uid/gid during POR

Step to reproduce this bug:
1. logon as root
2. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt;
3. touch /mnt/file;
4. chown system /mnt/file; chgrp system /mnt/file;
5. xfs_io -f /mnt/file -c "fsync";
6. godown /mnt;
7. umount /mnt;
8. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt;

After step 8) we will expect file's uid/gid are all system, but during
recovery, these two fields were not been recovered, fix it.
