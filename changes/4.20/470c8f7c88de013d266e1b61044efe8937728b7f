perf tools: Avoid double free in read_event_file()

The temporary 'buf' buffer allocated in read_event_file() may be freed
twice.  Move the free() call to the common function exit point.

Fixes the following coverity complaints:

  Error: USE_AFTER_FREE (CWE-825):
  tools/perf/util/trace-event-read.c:309: double_free: Calling "free"
  frees pointer "buf" which has already been freed.
