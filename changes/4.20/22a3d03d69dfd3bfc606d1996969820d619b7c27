powerpc/uapi: Fix sigcontext definition to use user_pt_regs

My recent patch to split pt_regs between user and kernel missed
the usage in struct sigcontext.

Because this is a user visible struct it should be using the user
visible definition, which when we're building for the kernel is called
struct user_pt_regs.

As far as I can see this hasn't actually caused a bug (yet), because
we don't use the sizeof() the sigcontext->regs anywhere. But we should
still fix it to avoid confusion and future bugs.
