Input: hyper-v - fix wakeup from suspend-to-idle

It makes little sense but still possible to put Hyper-V guests into
suspend-to-idle state. To wake them up two wakeup sources were registered
in the past: hyperv-keyboard and hid-hyperv. However, since
commit eed4d47efe95 ("ACPI / sleep: Ignore spurious SCI wakeups from
suspend-to-idle") pm_wakeup_event() from these devices is ignored. Switch
to pm_wakeup_hard_event() API as these devices are actually the only
possible way to wakeup Hyper-V guests.
