powerpc/papr_scm: Fix resource end address

Fix an off-by-one error in the memory resource range. This resource is
used to determine the address range of the memory to be hot-plugged as
ZONE_DEVICE memory. The current end address results in the kernel
attempting to map an additional memblock and the hypervisor may reject
the mapping resulting in the entire hot-plug failing.
