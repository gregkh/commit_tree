powerpc/memtrace: Remove memory in chunks

When hot-removing memory release_mem_region_adjustable() splits iomem
resources if they are not the exact size of the memory being
hot-deleted. Adding this memory back to the kernel adds a new resource.

Eg a node has memory 0x0 - 0xfffffffff. Hot-removing 1GB from
0xf40000000 results in the single resource 0x0-0xfffffffff being split
into two resources: 0x0-0xf3fffffff and 0xf80000000-0xfffffffff.

When we hot-add the memory back we now have three resources:
0x0-0xf3fffffff, 0xf40000000-0xf7fffffff, and 0xf80000000-0xfffffffff.

This is an issue if we try to remove some memory that overlaps
resources. Eg when trying to remove 2GB at address 0xf40000000,
release_mem_region_adjustable() fails as it expects the chunk of memory
to be within the boundaries of a single resource. We then get the
warning: "Unable to release resource" and attempting to use memtrace
again gives us this error: "bash: echo: write error: Resource
temporarily unavailable"

This patch makes memtrace remove memory in chunks that are always the
same size from an address that is always equal to end_of_memory -
n*size, for some n. So hotremoving and hotadding memory of different
sizes will now not attempt to remove memory that spans multiple
resources.
