octeontx2-af: NPC MCAM and LDATA extract minimal configuration

This patch adds some minimal configuration for NPC MCAM and
LDATA extraction which is sufficient enough to install
ucast/bcast/promiscuous forwarding rules. Below is the
config done
- LDATA extraction config to extract DMAC from pkt
  to offset 64bit in MCAM search key.
- Set MCAM lookup keysize to 224bits
- Set MCAM TX miss action to UCAST_DEFAULT
- Set MCAM RX miss action to DROP

Also inorder to have guaranteed space in MCAM to install
ucast forwarding rule for each of RVU PF/VF, reserved
one MCAM entry for each of NIXLF for ucast rule. And two
entries for each of RVU PF. One for bcast pkt replication
and other for promiscuous mode which allows all pkts
received on a HW CGX/LBK channel.
