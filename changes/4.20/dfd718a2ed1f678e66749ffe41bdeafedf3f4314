powerpc/rtas: Fix a potential race between CPU-Offline & Migration

Live Partition Migrations require all the present CPUs to execute the
H_JOIN call, and hence rtas_ibm_suspend_me() onlines any offline CPUs
before initiating the migration for this purpose.

The commit 85a88cabad57
("powerpc/pseries: Disable CPU hotplug across migrations")
disables any CPU-hotplug operations once all the offline CPUs are
brought online to prevent any further state change. Once the
CPU-Hotplug operation is disabled, the code assumes that all the CPUs
are online.

However, there is a minor window in rtas_ibm_suspend_me() between
onlining the offline CPUs and disabling CPU-Hotplug when a concurrent
CPU-offline operations initiated by the userspace can succeed thereby
nullifying the the aformentioned assumption. In this unlikely case
these offlined CPUs will not call H_JOIN, resulting in a system hang.

Fix this by verifying that all the present CPUs are actually online
after CPU-Hotplug has been disabled, failing which we restore the
state of the offline CPUs in rtas_ibm_suspend_me() and return an
-EBUSY.
