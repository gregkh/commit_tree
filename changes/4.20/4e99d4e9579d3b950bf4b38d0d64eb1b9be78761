xarray: Add xas_for_each_conflict

This iterator iterates over each entry that is stored in the index or
indices specified by the xa_state.  This is intended for use for a
conditional store of a multiindex entry, or to allow entries which are
about to be removed from the xarray to be disposed of properly.
