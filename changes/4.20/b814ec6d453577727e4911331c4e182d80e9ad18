drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Implement AUX channel

This was hand-rolled in the first version, and will surely be useful as
we expand the driver to support more varied use cases.

Changes in v2:
- Change subject prefix s/panel/bridge/
- Downgrade warning in poll function to error message
- Fix DP_EDP_CONFIGURATION_SET write value (Sandeep)
- Mask upper 8 bits of msg->address (Sandeep)
- Check aux cmd status for errors after completing the send (Sandeep)
- Remove length check since it's covered in the aux status
- Flip the READ check in transfer to WRITE check + early exit
Changes in v3:
- Added to the set
- Wrapped (x) in WDATA/RDATA #defines
- Replace readx_poll* with regmap_read_poll*
