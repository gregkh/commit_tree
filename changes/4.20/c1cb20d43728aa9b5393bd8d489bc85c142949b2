mm: use swp_offset as key in shmem_replace_page()

We changed the key of swap cache tree from swp_entry_t.val to
swp_offset.  We need to do so in shmem_replace_page() as well.

Hugh said:
 "shmem_replace_page() has been wrong since the day I wrote it: good
  enough to work on swap "type" 0, which is all most people ever use
  (especially those few who need shmem_replace_page() at all), but
  broken once there are any non-0 swp_type bits set in the higher order
  bits"
