powerpc/tm: Remove msr_tm_active()

Currently msr_tm_active() is a wrapper around MSR_TM_ACTIVE() if
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is set, or it is just a function that
returns false if CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is not set.

This function is not necessary, since MSR_TM_ACTIVE() just do the same and
could be used, removing the dualism and simplifying the code.

This patchset remove every instance of msr_tm_active() and replaced it
by MSR_TM_ACTIVE().
