media: v4l2-ctrls: add core request support

Integrate the request support. This adds the v4l2_ctrl_request_complete
and v4l2_ctrl_request_setup functions to complete a request and (as a
helper function) to apply a request to the hardware.

It takes care of queuing requests and correctly chaining control values
in the request queue.

Note that when a request is marked completed it will copy control values
to the internal request state. This can be optimized in the future since
this is sub-optimal when dealing with large compound and/or array controls.

For the initial 'stateless codec' use-case the current implementation is
sufficient.
