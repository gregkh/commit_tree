btrfs: remove unused pointer inode in relink_file_extents

Pointer inode is being assigned but is never used hence it is redundant
and can be removed. It's been unused since the introduction in
38c227d87c49a ("Btrfs: snapshot-aware defrag").

Cleans up clang warning:

  variable ‘inode’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
