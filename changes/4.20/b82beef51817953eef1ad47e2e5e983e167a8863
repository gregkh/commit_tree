bus: ti-sysc: Update revision masks to support am437x

We need to detect few new devices to tag for noirq_suspend and
pm_runtime_irq_safe to avoid causing regressions compared to
legacy platform data booting.

Let's update i2c, gpio, uart and wdt revision masks to detect
them on am437x. Note that we can remove the second wdt entry
with the updated mask. Note that we also have some uarts with
a different revision register.
