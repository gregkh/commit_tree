KVM: arm/arm64: Ensure only THP is candidate for adjustment

PageTransCompoundMap() returns true for hugetlbfs and THP
hugepages. This behaviour incorrectly leads to stage 2 faults for
unsupported hugepage sizes (e.g., 64K hugepage with 4K pages) to be
treated as THP faults.

Tighten the check to filter out hugetlbfs pages. This also leads to
consistently mapping all unsupported hugepage sizes as PTE level
entries at stage 2.
