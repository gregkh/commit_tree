soc: qcom: Remove depends on OF from QCOM_RPMH

QCOM_RPHM already selects ARM64, which always selects OF.

Additionally, the rpmh driver only uses linux/of.h, which has dummy
definitions for all functions, in order for code to to be able to
build without CONFIG_OF set.

Remove the superfluous depends on OF.
