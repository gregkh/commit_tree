net/ibmnvic: Fix deadlock problem in reset

This patch changes to use rtnl_lock only during a reset to avoid
deadlock that could occur when a thread operating close is holding
rtnl_lock and waiting for reset_lock acquired by another thread,
which is waiting for rtnl_lock in order to set the number of tx/rx
queues during a reset.

Also, we now setting the number of tx/rx queues during a soft reset
for failover or LPM events.
