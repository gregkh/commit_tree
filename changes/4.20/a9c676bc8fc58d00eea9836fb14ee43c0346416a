bpf/verifier: fix verifier instability

Edward Cree says:
In check_mem_access(), for the PTR_TO_CTX case, after check_ctx_access()
has supplied a reg_type, the other members of the register state are set
appropriately.  Previously reg.range was set to 0, but as it is in a
union with reg.map_ptr, which is larger, upper bytes of the latter were
left in place.  This then caused the memcmp() in regsafe() to fail,
preventing some branches from being pruned (and occasionally causing the
same program to take a varying number of processed insns on repeated
verifier runs).

Fix the instability by clearing bpf_reg_state in __mark_reg_[un]known()
