dt-bindings: pinctrl: document Broadcom Northstar pin mux controller

Northstar has mux controller just like Northstar Plus and Northstar2.
It's a bit different though (different registers & pins) so it requires
its own binding.

It's needed to allow other block bindings specify required mux setup.
