mlxsw: core: Fix devlink unregister flow

After a failed reload, the driver is still registered to devlink, its
devlink instance is still allocated and the 'reload_fail' flag is set.
Then, in the next reload try, the driver's allocated devlink instance will
be freed without unregistering from devlink and its components (e.g,
resources). This scenario can cause a use-after-free if the user tries to
execute command via devlink user-space tool.

Fix by not freeing the devlink instance during reload (failed or not).
