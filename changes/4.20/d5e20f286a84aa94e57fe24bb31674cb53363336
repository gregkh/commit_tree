arm64: dts: msm8916: Drop model and compatible

DTS board files should always specify model and compatible.

All DTS board files that includes msm8916.dtsi
already specifies model and compatible, and will thus
override the model and compatible in msm8916.dtsi.

Drop model and compatible from msm8916.dtsi,
since they are only a source of confusion.
