vxlan: changelink: Fix handling of default remotes

Default remotes are stored as FDB entries with an Ethernet address of
00:00:00:00:00:00. When a request is made to change a remote address of
a VXLAN device, vxlan_changelink() first deletes the existing default
remote, and then creates a new FDB entry.

This works well as long as the list of default remotes matches exactly
the configuration of a VXLAN remote address. Thus when the VXLAN device
has a remote of X, there should be exactly one default remote FDB entry
X. If the VXLAN device has no remote address, there should be no such
entry.

Besides using "ip link set", it is possible to manipulate the list of
default remotes by using the "bridge fdb". It is therefore easy to break
the above condition. Under such circumstances, the __vxlan_fdb_delete()
call doesn't delete the FDB entry itself, but just one remote. The
following vxlan_fdb_create() then creates a new FDB entry, leading to a
situation where two entries exist for the address 00:00:00:00:00:00,
each with a different subset of default remotes.

An even more obvious breakage rooted in the same cause can be observed
when a remote address is configured for a VXLAN device that did not have
one before. In that case vxlan_changelink() doesn't remove any remote,
and just creates a new FDB entry for the new address:

$ ip link add name vx up type vxlan id 2000 dstport 4789
$ bridge fdb ap dev vx 00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 192.0.2.20 self permanent
$ bridge fdb ap dev vx 00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 192.0.2.30 self permanent
$ ip link set dev vx type vxlan remote 192.0.2.30
$ bridge fdb sh dev vx | grep 00:00:00:00:00:00
00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 192.0.2.30 self permanent <- new entry, 1 rdst
00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 192.0.2.20 self permanent <- orig. entry, 2 rdsts
00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 192.0.2.30 self permanent

To fix this, instead of calling vxlan_fdb_create() directly, defer to
vxlan_fdb_update(). That has logic to handle the duplicates properly.
Additionally, it also handles notifications, so drop that call from
changelink as well.
