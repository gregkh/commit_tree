dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Set DTCn register explicitly

Normally, we wouldn't set the channel transfer count register directly
when using descriptor-driven transfers. However, there is no harm in
doing so, and it allows jz4780_dma_desc_residue() to report the correct
residue of an ongoing transfer, no matter when it is called.
