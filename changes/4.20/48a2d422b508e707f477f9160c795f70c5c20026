platform: goldfish: pipe: Prevent memory corruption from several threads writing to the same variable

Move the "pages" buffer into "struct goldfish_pipe". Since we are
locking the mutex on the pipe in transfer_max_buffers, other threads
willnot be able to write into it, but other pipe instances could be
served because they have its own buffer.
