nvmem: add support for cell lookups from machine code

Add a way for machine code users to associate devices with nvmem cells.

This restores the support for non-DT systems but following a different
approach. Cells must now be associated with devices using provided
routines and data structures before they can be retrieved using
nvmem_cell_get().

It's still possible to define cells statically in nvmem_config but
cells created this way still need to be associated with consumers using
lookup entries.

Note that nvmem_find() must be moved higher in the source file as we
want to call it from __nvmem_device_get() for devices that don't have
a device node.

The signature of __nvmem_device_get() is also changed as it's no longer
used to retrieve cells.
