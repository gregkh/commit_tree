drm/i915: Clear DRIVER_ATOMIC on a per-device basis

Currently we're clearing DRIVER_ATOMIC in driver.driver_features
for older platforms. This will not work correctly should we ever
have a system with and old and new GPU in it. While that is not
possible currently let's make the code more correct and use
the per-device driver_features instead.
