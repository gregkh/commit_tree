phy: phy-twl4030-usb: fix denied runtime access

When runtime is not enabled, pm_runtime_get_sync() returns -EACCESS,
the counter will be incremented but the resume callback not called,
so enumeration and charging will not start properly.
To avoid that happen, disable irq on suspend and recheck on resume.

Practically this happens when the device is woken up from suspend by
plugging in usb.
