staging:rtl8192u: Remove macro cpMacAddr - Style

The macro cpMacAddr implements the same functionality as the
ether_addr_copy function defined in etherdevice.h, as a result the
macro has been removed from the code, and its use replaced with the
function call.

Note that the header comment of the function ether_addr_copy states
that the two byte arrays passed as parameters to the function must
be u16 aligned. Because of this the structure ieee80211_network has
had its member variables re-ordered so that the members bssid and
MBssid are aligned to a u16 boundary.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
