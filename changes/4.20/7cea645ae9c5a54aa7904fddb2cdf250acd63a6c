backlight: lm3639: Unconditionally call led_classdev_unregister

Clang warns that the address of a pointer will always evaluated as true
in a boolean context.

drivers/video/backlight/lm3639_bl.c:403:14: warning: address of
'pchip->cdev_torch' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (&pchip->cdev_torch)
        ~~   ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~
drivers/video/backlight/lm3639_bl.c:405:14: warning: address of
'pchip->cdev_flash' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (&pchip->cdev_flash)
        ~~   ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~
2 warnings generated.

These statements have been present since 2012, introduced by
commit 0f59858d5119 ("backlight: add new lm3639 backlight
driver"). Given that they have been called unconditionally since
then presumably without any issues, removing the always true if
statements to fix the warnings without any real world changes.
