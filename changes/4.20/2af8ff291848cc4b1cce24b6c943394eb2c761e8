mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() remember to clear holes

Huge tmpfs testing reminds us that there is no __GFP_ZERO in the gfp
flags khugepaged uses to allocate a huge page - in all common cases it
would just be a waste of effort - so collapse_shmem() must remember to
clear out any holes that it instantiates.

The obvious place to do so, where they are put into the page cache tree,
is not a good choice: because interrupts are disabled there.  Leave it
until further down, once success is assured, where the other pages are
copied (before setting PageUptodate).
