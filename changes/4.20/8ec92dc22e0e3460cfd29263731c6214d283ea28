tools/bpf: bpftool, print strerror when map lookup error occurs

Since map lookup error can be ENOENT or EOPNOTSUPP, let's print
strerror() as error message in normal and JSON output.

This patch adds helper function print_entry_error() to print
entry from lookup error occurs

Example: Following example dumps a map which does not support lookup.

Output before:
root# bpftool map -jp dump id 40
[
    "key": ["0x0a","0x00","0x00","0x00"
    ],
    "value": {
        "error": "can\'t lookup element"
    },
    "key": ["0x0b","0x00","0x00","0x00"
    ],
    "value": {
        "error": "can\'t lookup element"
    }
]

root# bpftool map dump id 40
can't lookup element with key:
0a 00 00 00
can't lookup element with key:
0b 00 00 00
Found 0 elements

Output after changes:
root# bpftool map dump -jp  id 45
[
    "key": ["0x0a","0x00","0x00","0x00"
    ],
    "value": {
        "error": "Operation not supported"
    },
    "key": ["0x0b","0x00","0x00","0x00"
    ],
    "value": {
        "error": "Operation not supported"
    }
]

root# bpftool map dump id 45
key:
0a 00 00 00
value:
Operation not supported
key:
0b 00 00 00
value:
Operation not supported
Found 0 elements
