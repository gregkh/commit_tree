ixgbe: fix MAC anti-spoofing filter after VFLR

This change resolves a driver bug where the driver is logging a
message that says "Spoofed packets detected". This can occur on the PF
(host) when a VF has VLAN+MACVLAN enabled and is re-started with a
different MAC address.

MAC and VLAN anti-spoofing filters are to be enabled together.
