spi: spi-mem: Add extra sanity checks on the op param

Some combinations are simply not valid and should be rejected before
the op is passed to the SPI controller driver.

Add an spi_mem_check_op() helper and use it in spi_mem_exec_op() and
spi_mem_supports_op() to make sure the spi-mem operation is valid.
