drm_dp_mst_topology: fix broken drm_dp_sideband_parse_remote_dpcd_read()

When parsing the reply of a DP_REMOTE_DPCD_READ DPCD command the
result is wrong due to a missing idx increment.

This was never noticed since DP_REMOTE_DPCD_READ is currently not
used, but if you enable it, then it is all wrong.
