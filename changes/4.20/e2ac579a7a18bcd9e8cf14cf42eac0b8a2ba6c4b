sparc: Correct ctx->saw_frame_pointer logic.

We need to initialize the frame pointer register not just if it is
seen as a source operand, but also if it is seen as the destination
operand of a store or an atomic instruction (which effectively is a
source operand).

This is exercised by test_verifier's "non-invalid fp arithmetic"
