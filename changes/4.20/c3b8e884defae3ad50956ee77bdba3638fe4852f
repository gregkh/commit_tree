platform/x86: intel_int0002_vgpio: Implement irq_set_wake

We were relying on the interrupt being shared with the ACPI SCI and the
ACPI core calling irq_set_wake. But that does not always happen on
Bay Trail devices, so we should do it ourselves.

This fixes wake from USB not working on various Bay Trail devices.
