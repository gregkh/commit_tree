cifs: fallback to older infolevels on findfirst queryinfo retry

In cases where queryinfo fails, we have cases in cifs (vers=1.0)
where with backupuid mounts we retry the query info with findfirst.
This doesn't work to some NetApp servers which don't support
WindowsXP (and later) infolevel 261 (SMB_FIND_FILE_ID_FULL_DIR_INFO)
so in this case use other info levels (in this case it will usually
be level 257, SMB_FIND_FILE_DIRECTORY_INFO).

(Also fixes some indentation)
