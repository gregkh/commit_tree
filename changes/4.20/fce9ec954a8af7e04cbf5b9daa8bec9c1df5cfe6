ASoC: sta32x: Add support for XTI clock

The STA32x chips feature an XTI clock input that needs to be stable before
the reset signal is released. Therefore, the chip driver needs to get a
handle to the clock. Instead of relying on other parts of the system to
enable the clock, let the codec driver grab a handle itself.

In order to keep existing boards working, clock support is made optional.
