regulator: da905{2,5}: Remove unnecessary array check

Clang warns that the address of a pointer will always evaluated as true
in a boolean context:

drivers/regulator/da9052-regulator.c:423:22: warning: address of array
'pdata->regulators' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (pdata && pdata->regulators) {
                  ~~ ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~
drivers/regulator/da9055-regulator.c:615:22: warning: address of array
'pdata->regulators' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (pdata && pdata->regulators) {
                  ~~ ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~
