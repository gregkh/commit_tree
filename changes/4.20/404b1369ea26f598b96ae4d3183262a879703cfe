OPP: Don't try to remove all OPP tables on failure

dev_pm_opp_of_cpumask_add_table() creates the OPP table for all CPUs
present in the cpumask and on errors it should revert all changes it has
done.

It actually is doing a bit more than that. On errors, it tries to free
all the OPP tables, even the one it hasn't created yet. This may also
end up freeing the OPP tables which were created from separate path,
like dev_pm_opp_set_supported_hw().
