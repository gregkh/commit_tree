drm/amdgpu: Set pasid for compute vm (v2)

To make a amdgpu vm to a compute vm, the old pasid will be freed and
replaced with a pasid managed by kfd. Kfd can't reuse original pasid
allocated by amdgpu because kfd uses different pasid policy with amdgpu.
For example, all graphic devices share one same pasid in a process.

v2: rebase (Alex)
