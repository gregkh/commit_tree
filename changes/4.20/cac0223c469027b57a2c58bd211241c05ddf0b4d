media: renesas-ceu: Use default mbus settings

As the v4l2-fwnode now allows drivers to set defaults, and eventually
override them by specifying properties in DTS, use defaults for the CEU
driver.

Also remove endpoint properties from the gr-peach-audiocamerashield as
they match the defaults now specified in the driver code
(h/vsync-active and bus-width) or are not relevant to the interface
as they cannot be configured (pclk-sample).
