spi: mediatek: Don't modify spi_transfer when transfer.

Mediatek SPI driver modifies some fields (tx_buf, rx_buf, len, tx_dma,
rx_dma) of the spi_transfer* passed in when doing transfer_one and in
interrupt handler. This is somewhat unexpected, and there are some
caller (e.g. Cr50 spi driver) that reuse the spi_transfer for multiple
messages. Add a field to record how many bytes have been transferred,
and calculate the right len / buffer based on it instead.
