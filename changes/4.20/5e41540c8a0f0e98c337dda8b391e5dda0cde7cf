hugetlbfs: fix kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:444!

This bug has been experienced several times by the Oracle DB team.  The
BUG is in remove_inode_hugepages() as follows:

	/*
	 * If page is mapped, it was faulted in after being
	 * unmapped in caller.  Unmap (again) now after taking
	 * the fault mutex.  The mutex will prevent faults
	 * until we finish removing the page.
	 *
	 * This race can only happen in the hole punch case.
	 * Getting here in a truncate operation is a bug.
	 */
	if (unlikely(page_mapped(page))) {
		BUG_ON(truncate_op);

In this case, the elevated map count is not the result of a race.
Rather it was incorrectly incremented as the result of a bug in the huge
pmd sharing code.  Consider the following:

 - Process A maps a hugetlbfs file of sufficient size and alignment
   (PUD_SIZE) that a pmd page could be shared.

 - Process B maps the same hugetlbfs file with the same size and
   alignment such that a pmd page is shared.

 - Process B then calls mprotect() to change protections for the mapping
   with the shared pmd. As a result, the pmd is 'unshared'.

 - Process B then calls mprotect() again to chage protections for the
   mapping back to their original value. pmd remains unshared.

 - Process B then forks and process C is created. During the fork
   process, we do dup_mm -> dup_mmap -> copy_page_range to copy page
   tables. Copying page tables for hugetlb mappings is done in the
   routine copy_hugetlb_page_range.

In copy_hugetlb_page_range(), the destination pte is obtained by:

	dst_pte = huge_pte_alloc(dst, addr, sz);

If pmd sharing is possible, the returned pointer will be to a pte in an
existing page table.  In the situation above, process C could share with
either process A or process B.  Since process A is first in the list,
the returned pte is a pointer to a pte in process A's page table.

However, the check for pmd sharing in copy_hugetlb_page_range is:

	/* If the pagetables are shared don't copy or take references */
	if (dst_pte == src_pte)
		continue;

Since process C is sharing with process A instead of process B, the
above test fails.  The code in copy_hugetlb_page_range which follows
assumes dst_pte points to a huge_pte_none pte.  It copies the pte entry
from src_pte to dst_pte and increments this map count of the associated
page.  This is how we end up with an elevated map count.

To solve, check the dst_pte entry for huge_pte_none.  If !none, this
implies PMD sharing so do not copy.
