net/mlx5e: Gather common netdev init/cleanup functionality in one place

Introduce a helper init/cleanup function that initializes mlx5e generic
netdev private structure, and use them from all profiles init/cleanup
callbacks.

This patch will also be helpful to initialize/cleanup netdevs that are
not created by mlx5 driver, e.g: accelerated ipoib child netdevs.
