xhci: Use soft retry to recover faster from transaction errors

Use soft retry to recover from a USB Transaction Errors that are caused by
temporary error conditions. The USB device is not aware that the xHC
has halted the endpoint, and will be waiting for another retry

A Soft Retry perform additional retries and recover from an error which has
caused the xHC to halt an endpoint.

Soft retry has some limitations:
Soft Retry attempts shall not be performed on Isoch endpoints
Soft Retry attempts shall not be performed if the device is behind a TT in
a HS Hub

Software shall limit the number of unsuccessful Soft Retry attempts to
prevent an infinite loop.

For more details on Soft retry see xhci specs  4.6.8.1
