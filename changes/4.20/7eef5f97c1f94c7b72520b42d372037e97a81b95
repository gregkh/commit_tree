mm: thp: relocate flush_cache_range() in migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page()

There should be no cache left by the time we overwrite the old transhuge
pmd with the new one.  It's already too late to flush through the virtual
address because we already copied the page data to the new physical
address.

So flush the cache before the data copy.

Also delete the "end" variable to shutoff a "unused variable" warning on
x86 where flush_cache_range() is a noop.
