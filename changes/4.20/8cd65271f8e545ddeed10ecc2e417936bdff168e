ALSA: hda/realtek - fix headset mic detection for MSI MS-B171

MSI Cubi N 8GL (MS-B171) needs the same fixup as its older model, the
MS-B120, in order for the headset mic to be properly detected.

They both use a single 3-way jack for both mic and headset with an
ALC283 codec, with the same pins used.
