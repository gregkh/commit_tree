ARM: imx: update the cpu power up timing setting on i.mx6sx

The sw2iso count should cover ARM LDO ramp-up time,
the MAX ARM LDO ramp-up time may be up to more than
100us on some boards, this patch sets sw2iso to 0xf
(~384us) which is the reset value, and it is much
more safe to cover different boards, since we have
observed that some customer boards failed with current
setting of 0x2.
