ALSA: hda/realtek: ALC294 mic and headset-mode fixups for ASUS X542UN

The known ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC fixup can fix the headphone jack
sensing and enable use of the internal microphone on this laptop
X542UN. However, it's ALC294 so create a new fixup named
ALC294_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC to avoid confusion.
