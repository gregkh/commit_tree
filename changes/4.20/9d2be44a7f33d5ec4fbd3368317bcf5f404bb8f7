bpf: Reuse canonical string formatter for ctx errs

The array "reg_type_str" provides canonical formatting of register
types, however a couple of places would previously check whether a
register represented the context and write the name "context" directly.
An upcoming commit will add another pointer type to these statements, so
to provide more accurate error messages in the verifier, update these
error messages to use "reg_type_str" instead.
