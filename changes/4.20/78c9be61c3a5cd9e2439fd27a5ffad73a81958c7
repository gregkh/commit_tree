ALSA: hda: Check the non-cached stream buffers more explicitly

Introduce a new flag, uc_buffer, to indicate that the controller
requires the non-cached pages for stream buffers, either as a
chip-specific requirement or specified via snoop=0 option.
This improves the code-readability.

Also, this patch fixes the incorrect behavior for C-Media chip where
the stream buffers were never handled as non-cached due to the check
of driver_type even if you pass snoop=0 option.
