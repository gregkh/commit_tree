x86/PCI: Remove node-local allocation when initialising host controller

Memory for host controller data structures is allocated local to the node
to which the controller is associated with.  This has been the behaviour
since 965cd0e4a5e5 ("x86, PCI, ACPI: Use kmalloc_node() to optimize for
performance") where the node local allocation was added without additional
context.

Drop the node local allocation as there is no benefit from doing so - the
usage of these structures is independent from where the controller is
located.
