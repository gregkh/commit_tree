s390/vdso: avoid 64-bit vdso mapping for compat tasks

vdso_fault used is_compat_task function (on s390 it tests "current"
thread_info flags) to distinguish compat tasks and map 31-bit vdso
pages. But "current" task might not correspond to mm context.

When 31-bit compat inferior is executed under gdb, gdb does
PTRACE_PEEKTEXT on vdso page, causing vdso_fault with "current" being
64-bit gdb process. So, 31-bit inferior ends up with 64-bit vdso mapped.

To avoid this problem a new compat_mm flag has been introduced into
mm context. This flag is used in vdso_fault and vdso_mremap instead
of is_compat_task.
