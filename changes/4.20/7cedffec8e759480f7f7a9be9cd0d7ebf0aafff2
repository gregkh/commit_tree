block: Make blk_get_request() block for non-PM requests while suspended

Instead of allowing requests that are not power management requests
to enter the queue in runtime suspended status (RPM_SUSPENDED), make
the blk_get_request() caller block. This change fixes a starvation
issue: it is now guaranteed that power management requests will be
executed no matter how many blk_get_request() callers are waiting.
For blk-mq, instead of maintaining the q->nr_pending counter, rely
on q->q_usage_counter. Call pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() every time a
request finishes instead of only if the queue depth drops to zero.
