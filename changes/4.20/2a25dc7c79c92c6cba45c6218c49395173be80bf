x86/mm/init32: Mark text and rodata RO in one go

The sequence of marking text and rodata read-only in 32bit init is:

  set_ro(text);
  kernel_set_to_readonly = 1;
  set_ro(rodata);

When kernel_set_to_readonly is 1 it enables the protection mechanism in CPA
for the read only regions. With the upcoming checks for existing mappings
this consequently triggers the warning about an existing mapping being
incorrect vs. static protections because rodata has not been converted yet.

There is no technical reason to split the two, so just combine the RO
protection to convert text and rodata in one go.

Convert the printks to pr_info while at it.
