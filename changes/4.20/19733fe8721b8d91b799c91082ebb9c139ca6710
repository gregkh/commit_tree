s390/head: avoid doubling early boot stack size under KASAN

Early boot stack uses predefined 4 pages of memory 0x8000-0xC000. This
stack is used to run not instumented decompressor/facilities
verification C code. It doesn't make sense to double its size when
the kernel is built with KASAN support. BOOT_STACK_ORDER is introduced
to avoid that.
