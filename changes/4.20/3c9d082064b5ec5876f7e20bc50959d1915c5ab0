thermal: stm32: read factory settings inside stm_thermal_prepare

Calling stm_thermal_read_factory_settings before clocking
internal peripheral causes bad register values and makes
temperature computation wrong.

Calling stm_thermal_read_factory_settings inside
stm_thermal_prepare fixes this problem as internal
peripheral is well clocked at this stage.
