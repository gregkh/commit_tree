regmap: Add regmap_noinc_write API

The regmap API had a noinc_read function added for instances where devices
supported returning data from an internal FIFO in a single read.

This commit adds the noinc_write variant to allow writing to a non
incrementing register, this is used in devices such as the sx1301 for
loading firmware.
