compiler: introduce __no_sanitize_address_or_inline

Due to conflict between kasan instrumentation and inlining
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67368 functions which are
defined as inline could not be called from functions defined with
__no_sanitize_address.

Introduce __no_sanitize_address_or_inline which would expand to
__no_sanitize_address when the kernel is built with kasan support and
to inline otherwise. This helps to avoid disabling kasan
instrumentation for entire files.
