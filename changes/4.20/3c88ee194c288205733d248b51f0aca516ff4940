x86: ptrace: Add function argument access API

Add regs_get_argument() which returns N th argument of the
function call.
Note that this chooses most probably assignment, in some case
it can be incorrect (e.g. passing data structure or floating
point etc.)

This is expected to be called from kprobes or ftrace with regs
where the top of stack is the return address.
