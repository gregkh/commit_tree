checkstack.pl: fix for aarch64

There is actually a space after "sp," like this,

    ffff2000080813c8:       a9bb7bfd        stp     x29, x30, [sp, #-80]!

Right now, checkstack.pl isn't able to print anything on aarch64,
because it won't be able to match the stating objdump line of a function
due to this missing space.  Hence, it displays every stack as zero-size.

After this patch, checkpatch.pl is able to match the start of a
function's objdump, and is then able to calculate each function's stack
correctly.
