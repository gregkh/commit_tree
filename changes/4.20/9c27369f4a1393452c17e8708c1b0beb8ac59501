r8152: Add support for MAC address pass through on RTL8153-BND

All previous docks and dongles that have supported this feature use
the RTL8153-AD chip.

RTL8153-BND is a new chip that will be used in upcoming Dell type-C docks.
It should be added to the whitelist of devices to activate MAC address
pass through.

Per confirming with Realtek all devices containing RTL8153-BND should
activate MAC pass through and there won't use pass through bit on efuse
like in RTL8153-AD.
