media: sr030pc30: remove NULL in sr030pc30_base_config()

This code doesn't check for NULL consistently and it generates a Smatch
warning:

    drivers/media/i2c/sr030pc30.c:575 sr030pc30_base_config()
    error: we previously assumed 'info->pdata' could be null (see line 572)

Fortunately, "info->pdata" can't be NULL to that check can be removed.
The other thing is that if "ret" is an error code here, then we don't
want to do the next call to cam_i2c_write(), so actually let's flip that
test around and return the error.  This is more of a theoretical issue
than something which is likely to affect real life.
