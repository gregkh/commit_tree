tools: bpftool: document restriction on '.' in names to pin in bpffs

Names used to pin eBPF programs and maps under the eBPF virtual file
system cannot contain a dot character, which is reserved for future
extensions of this file system.

Document this in bpftool man pages to avoid users getting confused if
pinning fails because of a dot.
