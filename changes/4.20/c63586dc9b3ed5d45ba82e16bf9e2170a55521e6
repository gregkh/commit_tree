net: rtnl_dump_all needs to propagate error from dumpit function

If an address, route or netconf dump request is sent for AF_UNSPEC, then
rtnl_dump_all is used to do the dump across all address families. If one
of the dumpit functions fails (e.g., invalid attributes in the dump
request) then rtnl_dump_all needs to propagate that error so the user
gets an appropriate response instead of just getting no data.
