drivers/vfio: Allow type-1 IOMMU instantiation with all ARM/ARM64 IOMMUs

Currently the type-1 IOMMU instantiation depends on "ARM_SMMU ||
ARM_SMMU_V3", while it applies to other ARM/ARM64 platforms with an
IOMMU (e.g. Renesas VMSA-compatible IPMMUs).

Instead of extending the list of IOMMU types on ARM platforms, replace
the list by "ARM || ARM64", like other architectures do.  The feature is
still restricted to ARM/ARM64 platforms with an IOMMU by the dependency
on IOMMU_API.
