ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Fix possible use of uninitialized field

While playing with initialization order of modem device, it has been
discovered that under some circumstances (early console init, I
believe) its .pm() callback may be called before the
uart_port->private_data pointer is initialized from
plat_serial8250_port->private_data, resulting in NULL pointer
dereference.  Fix it by checking for uninitialized pointer before using
it in modem_pm().
