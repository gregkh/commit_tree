btrfs: tests: add separate stub for find_lock_delalloc_range

The helper find_lock_delalloc_range is now conditionally built static,
dpending on whether the self-tests are enabled or not. There's a macro
that is supposed to hide the export, used only once. To discourage
further use, drop it an add a public wrapper for the helper needed by
tests.
