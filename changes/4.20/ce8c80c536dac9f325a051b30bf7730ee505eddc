arm64: Add workaround for Cortex-A76 erratum 1286807

On the affected Cortex-A76 cores (r0p0 to r3p0), if a virtual address
for a cacheable mapping of a location is being accessed by a core while
another core is remapping the virtual address to a new physical page
using the recommended break-before-make sequence, then under very rare
circumstances TLBI+DSB completes before a read using the translation
being invalidated has been observed by other observers. The workaround
repeats the TLBI+DSB operation and is shared with the Qualcomm Falkor
erratum 1009
