RISC-V: Add logical CPU indexing for RISC-V

Currently, both Linux CPU id and hart id are same.
This is not recommended as it will lead to discontinuous CPU
indexing in Linux. Moreover, kdump kernel will run from CPU0
which would be absent if we follow existing scheme.

Implement a logical mapping between Linux CPU id and hart
id to decouple these two. Always mark the boot processor as
CPU0 and all other CPUs get the logical CPU id based on their
booting order.
