bpf: test_sockmap add options to use msg_push_data

Add options to run msg_push_data, this patch creates two more flags
in test_sockmap that can be used to specify the offset and length
of bytes to be added. The new options are --txmsg_start_push to
specify where bytes should be inserted and --txmsg_end_push to
specify how many bytes. This is analagous to the options that are
used to pull data, --txmsg_start and --txmsg_end.

In addition to adding the options tests are added to the test
suit to run the tests similar to what was done for msg_pull_data.
