mailbox: PCC: handle parse error

acpi_pcc_probe() calls acpi_table_parse_entries_array() but fails
to check for an error return.  This in turn can result in calling
kcalloc() with a negative count as well as emitting the following
misleading erorr message:

[    2.642015] Could not allocate space for PCC mbox channels
