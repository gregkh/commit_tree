sched/topology, arch/arm: Rebuild sched_domain hierarchy when CPU capacity changes

Asymmetric CPU capacity can not necessarily be determined accurately at
the time the initial sched_domain hierarchy is built during boot. It is
therefore necessary to be able to force a full rebuild of the hierarchy
later triggered by the arch_topology driver. A full rebuild requires the
arch-code to implement arch_update_cpu_topology() which isn't yet
implemented for arm. This patch points the arm implementation to
arch_topology driver to ensure that full hierarchy rebuild happens when
needed.
