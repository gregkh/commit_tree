signal: Introduce copy_siginfo_from_user and use it's return value

In preparation for using a smaller version of siginfo in the kernel
introduce copy_siginfo_from_user and use it when siginfo is copied from
userspace.

Make the pattern for using copy_siginfo_from_user and
copy_siginfo_from_user32 to capture the return value and return that
value on error.

This is a necessary prerequisite for using a smaller siginfo
in the kernel than the kernel exports to userspace.
