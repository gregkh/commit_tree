xhci: handle port status events for removed USB3 hcd

At xhci removal the USB3 hcd (shared_hcd) is removed before the primary
USB2 hcd. Interrupts for port status changes may still occur for USB3
ports after the shared_hcd is freed, causing  NULL pointer dereference.

Check if xhci->shared_hcd is still valid before handing USB3 port events
