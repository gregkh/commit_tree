net: hns3: Fix parameter type for q_id in hclge_tm_q_to_qs_map_cfg()

So far all the places calling hclge_tm_q_to_qs_map_cfg() are assigning
an u16 type value to "q_id", and in the processing of
hclge_tm_q_to_qs_map_cfg(), it also converts the "q_id" to le16.

The max tqp number for pf can be more than 256, we should use "u16" to
store the queue id, instead of "u8", which may cause data lost.
