Input: synaptics - enable SMBus for HP EliteBook 840 G4

dmesg reports that "Your touchpad (PNP: SYN3052 SYN0100 SYN0002 PNP0f13)
says it can support a different bus."

I've tested the offered psmouse.synaptics_intertouch=1 with 4.18.x and
4.19.x and it seems to work well. No problems seen with suspend/resume.

Also, it appears that RMI/SMBus mode is actually required for 3-4 finger
multitouch gestures to work -- otherwise they are not reported at all.

Information from dmesg in both modes:
