staging:rtl8192u: Refactor struct HT_CAPABILITY_ELE - Style

The structure HT_CAPABILITY_ELE causes a number of checkpatch / coding
style issues. The structure uses a 'typedef' directive causing an
issue regarding defining new types in the code. The name of the
structure should be lowercase, and the '__packed' directive is prefered
over the attribute directive.

The typedef has been removed, structure renamed to ht_capability_ele
and the '__packed' directive used.

These are coding style changes and should not impact on runtime code
execution.
