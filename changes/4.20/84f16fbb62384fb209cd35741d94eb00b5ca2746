wil6210: fix RX buffers release and unmap

RX SKBs are released in both wil6210 rmmod and RX handle.
As there is no lock to protect the buffers DMA unmap,
the SKB pointer in buff_arr is used to check if the buffer
memory was already released.
Setting wil->rx_buff_mgmt.buff_arr[buff_id].skb to NULL before the DMA
memory unmap will prevent duplicate unmapping of the same memory.
Move the buffer ID to the free list also in case the SKB is NULL.
