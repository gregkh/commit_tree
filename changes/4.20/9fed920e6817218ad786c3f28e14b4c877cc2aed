s390/kasan: increase instrumented stack size to 64k

Increase kasan instrumented kernel stack size from 32k to 64k. Other
architectures seems to get away with just doubling kernel stack size under
kasan, but on s390 this appears to be not enough due to bigger frame size.
The particular pain point is kasan inlined checks (CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE
vs CONFIG_KASAN_OUTLINE). With inlined checks one particular case hitting
stack overflow is fs sync on xfs filesystem:

To be able to increase the stack size to 64k reuse LLILL instruction
in __switch_to function to load 64k - STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD - __PT_SIZE
(65192) value as unsigned.
