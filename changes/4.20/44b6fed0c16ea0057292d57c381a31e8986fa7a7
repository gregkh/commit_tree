nfp: bpf: double check vNIC capabilities after object sharing

Program translation stage checks that program can be offloaded to
the netdev which was passed during the load (bpf_attr->prog_ifindex).
After program sharing was introduced, however, the netdev on which
program is loaded can theoretically be different, and therefore
we should recheck the program size and max stack size at load time.

This was found by code inspection, AFAIK today all vNICs have
identical caps.
