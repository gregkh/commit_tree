ARM: dts: meson8b: fix the clock controller register size

The clock controller registers are not 0x460 wide because the reset
controller starts at CBUS 0x4404. This currently overlaps with the
clock controller (which is at CBUS 0x4000).

There is no public documentation available on the actual size of the
clock controller's register area (also called "HHI"). However, in
Amlogic's GPL kernel sources the last "HHI" register is
HHI_HDMI_PHY_CNTL2 at CBUS + 0x43a8. 0x400 was chosen because that size
doesn't seem unlikely.
