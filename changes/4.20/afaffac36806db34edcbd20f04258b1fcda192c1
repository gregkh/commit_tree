sparc: Set "ARCH: sunxx" information on the same line

While checking boot log from SPARC qemu, I saw that the "ARCH: sunxx"
information was split on two different line.
This patchs merge both line together.
In the meantime, thoses information need to be printed via pr_info
since printk print them by default via the warning loglevel.
