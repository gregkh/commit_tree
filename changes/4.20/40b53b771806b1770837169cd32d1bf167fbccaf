tracing: probeevent: Add array type support

Add array type support for probe events.
This allows user to get arraied types from memory address.
The array type syntax is

	TYPE[N]

Where TYPE is one of types (u8/16/32/64,s8/16/32/64,
x8/16/32/64, symbol, string) and N is a fixed value less
than 64.

The string array type is a bit different from other types. For
other base types, <base-type>[1] is equal to <base-type>
(e.g. +0(%di):x32[1] is same as +0(%di):x32.) But string[1] is not
equal to string. The string type itself represents "char array",
but string array type represents "char * array". So, for example,
+0(%di):string[1] is equal to +0(+0(%di)):string.
