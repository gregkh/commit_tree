KVM: PPC: Use exported tb_to_ns() function in decrementer emulation

This changes the KVM code that emulates the decrementer function to do
the conversion of decrementer values to time intervals in nanoseconds
by calling the tb_to_ns() function exported by the powerpc timer code,
in preference to open-coded arithmetic using values from the
decrementer_clockevent struct.  Similarly, the HV-KVM code that did
the same conversion using arithmetic on tb_ticks_per_sec also now
uses tb_to_ns().
