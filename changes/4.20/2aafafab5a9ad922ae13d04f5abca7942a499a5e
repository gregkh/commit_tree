drm/sun4i: Use (struct drm_format_info) fields to determine if a format is yuv and multi planar or not.

We do not need sun4i_backend_format_is_packed_yuv422() /
sun4i_backend_format_is_planar_yuv() to determine if the format is yuv multi planar
or not. (struct drm_format_info *)->is_yuv tells if the format is yuv or not.
And (struct drm_format_info *)->num_planes denotes the number of planes.
