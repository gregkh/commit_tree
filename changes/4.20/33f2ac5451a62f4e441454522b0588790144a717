MIPS: Loongon64: DMA functions cleanup

Split the common dma.c which shared by Loongson-2E and Loongson-2F,
since the code in 'common' directory is assumed be shared by all 64bit
Loongson platforms (but Loongson-3 doesn't use it now). By the way,
Loongson-2E and Loongson-2F have already dropped 32bit kernel support,
so CONFIG_64BIT isn't needed.
