media: i2c: mt9v111: Fix v4l2-ctrl error handling

Fix error handling of v4l2_ctrl creation by inspecting the ctrl.error flag
instead of testing for each returned value correctness.

As reported by Dan Carpenter returning PTR_ERR() on the v4l2_ctrl_new_std()
return value is also wrong, as that function return NULL on error.

While at there re-order the cleanup path to respect the operation inverse
order.
