powerpc/mm: Distribute platform specific PAGE and PMD flags and definitions

The base kernel PAGE_XXXX definition sets are more or less platform
specific. Lets distribute them close to platform _PAGE_XXX flags
definition, and customise them to their exact platform flags.

Also defines _PAGE_PSIZE and _PTE_NONE_MASK for each platform
allthough they are defined as 0.

Do the same with _PMD flags like _PMD_USER and _PMD_PRESENT_MASK
