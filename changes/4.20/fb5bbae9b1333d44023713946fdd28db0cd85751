drm/i915/ringbuffer: Delay after EMIT_INVALIDATE for gen4/gen5

Exercising the gpu reloc path strenuously revealed an issue where the
updated relocations (from MI_STORE_DWORD_IMM) were not being observed
upon execution. After some experiments with adding pipecontrols (a lot
of pipecontrols (32) as gen4/5 do not have a bit to wait on earlier pipe
controls or even the current on), it was discovered that we merely
needed to delay the EMIT_INVALIDATE by several flushes. It is important
to note that it is the EMIT_INVALIDATE as opposed to the EMIT_FLUSH that
needs the delay as opposed to what one might first expect -- that the
delay is required for the TLB invalidation to take effect (one presumes
to purge any CS buffers) as opposed to a delay after flushing to ensure
the writes have landed before triggering invalidation.
