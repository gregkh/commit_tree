btrfs: reset max_extent_size properly

If we use up our block group before allocating a new one we'll easily
get a max_extent_size that's set really really low, which will result in
a lot of fragmentation.  We need to make sure we're resetting the
max_extent_size when we add a new chunk or add new space.
