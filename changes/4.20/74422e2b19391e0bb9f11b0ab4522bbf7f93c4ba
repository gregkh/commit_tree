powerpc/pseries: Remove VLA from lparcfg_write()

In lparcfg_write we hard code kbuf_sz and then use this as the variable
length of kbuf creating a variable length array. Since we're hard coding
the length anyway just define the array using this as the length and
remove the need for kbuf_sz, thus removing the variable length array.
