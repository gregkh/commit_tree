knfsd: Simplify NFS duplicate replay cache

Simplify the duplicate replay cache by initialising the preallocated
cache entry, so that we can use it as a key for the cache lookup.

Note that the 99.999% case we want to optimise for is still the one
where the lookup fails, and we have to add this entry to the cache,
so preinitialising should not cause a performance penalty.
