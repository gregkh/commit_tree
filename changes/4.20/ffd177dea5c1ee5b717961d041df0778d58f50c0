tcp: refactor DCTCP ECN ACK handling

DCTCP has two parts - a new ECN signalling mechanism and the response
function to it. The first part can be used by other congestion
control for DCTCP-ECN deployed networks. This patch moves that part
into a separate tcp_dctcp.h to be used by other congestion control
module (like how Yeah uses Vegas algorithmas). For example, BBR is
experimenting such ECN signal currently
