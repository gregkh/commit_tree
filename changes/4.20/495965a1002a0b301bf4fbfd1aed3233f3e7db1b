platform: x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Add connections for the USB Type-C port

Assigning the mux to the USB Type-C port on top of fusb302.
That will prepare this driver for the change in the USB
Type-C class code, where the class driver will assume the
muxes to be always assigned to the ports and not the
controllers.

Once the USB Type-C class driver has been updated, the
connections between the mux and fusb302 can be dropped.
