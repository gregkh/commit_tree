samples/bpf: extend test_cgrp2_attach2 test to use per-cpu cgroup storage

This commit extends the test_cgrp2_attach2 test to cover per-cpu
cgroup storage. Bpf program will use shared and per-cpu cgroup
storages simultaneously, so a better coverage of corresponding
core code will be achieved.

Expected output:
  $ ./test_cgrp2_attach2
  Attached DROP prog. This ping in cgroup /foo should fail...
  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
  Attached DROP prog. This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should fail...
  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
  Attached PASS prog. This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should pass...
  Detached PASS from /foo/bar while DROP is attached to /foo.
  This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should fail...
  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
  Attached PASS from /foo/bar and detached DROP from /foo.
  This ping in cgroup /foo/bar should pass...
  ### override:PASS
