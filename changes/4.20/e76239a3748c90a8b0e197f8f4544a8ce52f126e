block: add a report_zones method

Dispatching a report zones command through the request queue is a major
pain due to the command reply payload rewriting necessary. Given that
blkdev_report_zones() is executing everything synchronously, implement
report zones as a block device file operation instead, allowing major
simplification of the code in many places.

sd, null-blk, dm-linear and dm-flakey being the only block device
drivers supporting exposing zoned block devices, these drivers are
modified to provide the device side implementation of the
report_zones() block device file operation.

For device mappers, a new report_zones() target type operation is
defined so that the upper block layer calls blkdev_report_zones() can
be propagated down to the underlying devices of the dm targets.
Implementation for this new operation is added to the dm-linear and
dm-flakey targets.
