tcp: do not release socket ownership in tcp_close()

syzkaller was able to hit the WARN_ON(sock_owned_by_user(sk));
in tcp_close()

While a socket is being closed, it is very possible other
threads find it in rtnetlink dump.

tcp_get_info() will acquire the socket lock for a short amount
of time (slow = lock_sock_fast(sk)/unlock_sock_fast(sk, slow);),
enough to trigger the warning.

Fixes: 67db3e4bfbc9 ("tcp: no longer hold ehash lock while calling tcp_get_info()")
