mt76x0: phy: add phy/vco temperature compensation

Introduce phy/vco temperature calibration.
Moreover fix configuration of register 67 on bank0
during temperature reading and use mt76_poll utility routine
to poll core34 register.
Furthermore temperature compensation needs to be disabled
if the device supports tssi compensation.
This issue has never been hit since temperature reading is not
actually used by usb code.
