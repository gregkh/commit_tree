usb: dwc3: gadget: Properly check last unaligned/zero chain TRB

Current check for the last extra TRB for zero and unaligned transfers
does not account for isoc OUT. The last TRB of the Buffer Descriptor for
isoc OUT transfers will be retired with HWO=0. As a result, we won't
return early. The req->remaining will be updated to include the BUFSIZ
count of the extra TRB, and the actual number of transferred bytes
calculation will be wrong.

To fix this, check whether it's a short or zero packet and the last TRB
chain bit to return early.
