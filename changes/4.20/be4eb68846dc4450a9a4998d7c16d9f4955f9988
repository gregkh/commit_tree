CIFS: Add direct I/O functions to file_operations

With direct read/write functions implemented, add them to file_operations.

Dircet I/O is used under two conditions:
1. When mounting with "cache=none", CIFS uses direct I/O for all user file
data transfer.
2. When opening a file with O_DIRECT, CIFS uses direct I/O for all data
transfer on this file.
