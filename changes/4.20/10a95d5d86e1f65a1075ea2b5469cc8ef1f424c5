vmw_balloon: handle commands in a single function.

By inlining the hypercall interface, we can unify several operations
into one central point in the code:

- Updating the target.
- Updating when a reset is needed.
- Update statistics (which will be done later in the patch-set).
- Print debug-messages (although they cannot be enabled as selectively).
