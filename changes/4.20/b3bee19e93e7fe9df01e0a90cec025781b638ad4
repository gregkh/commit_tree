coresight: tmc: Refactor loops in etb dump

In ETB dump function tmc_etb_dump_hw() it has nested loops.  The second
level loop is to iterate index in the range [0 .. drvdata->memwidth);
but the index isn't really used in the code, thus the second level
loop is useless.

This patch is to remove the second level loop; the refactor also reduces
indentation and we can use 'break' to replace 'goto' tag.
