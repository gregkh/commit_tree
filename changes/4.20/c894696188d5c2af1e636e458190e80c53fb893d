rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: replace _rtl8821ae_mrate_idx_to_arfr_id with generic version

Function _rtl8821ae_mrate_idx_to_arfr_id is functionally identical to
the generic version rtl_mrate_idx_to_arfr_id, so remove
_rtl8821ae_mrate_idx_to_arfr_id and use the generic one instead.

This also fixes a missing break statement found by CoverityScan in
_rtl8821ae_mrate_idx_to_arfr_id, namely: CID#1167237 ("Missing break
in switch")

Thanks to Joe Perches for spotting this when I submitted an earlier patch.
