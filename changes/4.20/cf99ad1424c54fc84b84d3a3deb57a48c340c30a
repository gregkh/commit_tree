perf record: Support weak groups

Implement a weak group fallback for 'perf record', similar to the
existing 'perf stat' support.  This allows to use groups that might be
longer than the available counters without failing.

Before:

  $ perf record  -e '{cycles,cache-misses,cache-references,cpu_clk_unhalted.thread,cycles,cycles,cycles}' -a sleep 1
  Error:
  The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument) for event (cycles).
  /bin/dmesg | grep -i perf may provide additional information.

After:

  $ ./perf record  -e '{cycles,cache-misses,cache-references,cpu_clk_unhalted.thread,cycles,cycles,cycles}:W' -a sleep 1
  WARNING: No sample_id_all support, falling back to unordered processing
  [ perf record: Woken up 3 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 8.136 MB perf.data (134069 samples) ]
