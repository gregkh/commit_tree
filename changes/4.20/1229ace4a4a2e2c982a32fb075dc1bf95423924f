MIPS: Loongson3,SGI-IP27: Simplify max_low_pfn calculation

Both the Loongson3 & SGI-IP27 platforms set max_low_pfn to the last
available PFN describing memory. They both do it in paging_init() which
is later than ideal since max_low_pfn is used before that function is
called. Simplify both platforms to trivially initialize max_low_pfn
using the end address of DRAM, and do it earlier in prom_meminit().
