signal/unicore32: Generate siginfo in ucs32_notify_die

Pass the signal number, and the signal code, and the faulting
address into uc32_notify_die so the callers do not need
to generate a struct siginfo.

In ucs32_ntoify_die use the newly passed in information to
call force_sig_fault to generate the siginfo and send the error.

This simplifies the code making the chances of bugs much less likely.
