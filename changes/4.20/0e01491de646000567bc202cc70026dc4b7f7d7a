net: dsa: b53: Add SerDes support

Add support for the Northstar Plus SerDes which is accessed through a
special page of the switch. Since this is something that most people
probably will not want to use, make it a configurable option with a
default on ARCH_BCM_NSP where it is the most useful currently.

The SerDes supports both SGMII and 1000baseX modes for both lanes, and
2500baseX for one of the lanes, and is internally looking like a
seemingly standard MII PHY, except for the few bits that got repurposed.
