staging:rtl8192u: Rename dot11d_init to fix name clash

The function dot11d_init() was previously renamed to clear a style
issue. Unfortunately the new name used, dot11d_init(), clashes with
a sybmol which is exported with the same name. To correct this
problem the function has been renamed to rtl8192u_dot11d_init().
