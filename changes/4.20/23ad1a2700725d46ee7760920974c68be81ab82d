powerpc: Add -Werror at arch/powerpc level

Back when I added -Werror in commit ba55bd74360e ("powerpc: Add
configurable -Werror for arch/powerpc") I did it by adding it to most
of the arch Makefiles.

At the time we excluded math-emu, because apparently it didn't build
cleanly. But that seems to have been fixed somewhere in the interim.

So move the -Werror addition to the top-level of the arch, this saves
us from repeating it in every Makefile and means we won't forget to
add it to any new sub-dirs.
