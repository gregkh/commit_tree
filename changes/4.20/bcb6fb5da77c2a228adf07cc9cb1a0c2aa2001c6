objtool: Support GCC 9 cold subfunction naming scheme

Starting with GCC 8, a lot of unlikely code was moved out of line to
"cold" subfunctions in .text.unlikely.

For example, the unlikely bits of:

  irq_do_set_affinity()

are moved out to the following subfunction:

  irq_do_set_affinity.cold.49()

Starting with GCC 9, the numbered suffix has been removed.  So in the
above example, the cold subfunction is instead:

  irq_do_set_affinity.cold()

Tweak the objtool subfunction detection logic so that it detects both
GCC 8 and GCC 9 naming schemes.
