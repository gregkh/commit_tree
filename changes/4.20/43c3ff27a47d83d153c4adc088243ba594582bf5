drm/amd/display: fix bug of accessing invalid memory

[Why]
A loop inside of build_evenly_distributed_points function that traverse through
the array of points become an infinite loop when m_GammaUpdates does not
get assigned to any value.

[How]
In DMColor, clear m_gammaIsValid bit just before writting all Zeromem for
m_GammaUpdates, to prevent calling build_evenly_distributed_points
before m_GammaUpdates gets assigned to some value.
