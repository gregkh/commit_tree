xtensa: enable coprocessors that are being flushed

coprocessor_flush_all may be called from a context of a thread that is
different from the thread being flushed. In that case contents of the
cpenable special register may not match ti->cpenable of the target
thread, resulting in unhandled coprocessor exception in the kernel
context.
Set cpenable special register to the ti->cpenable of the target register
for the duration of the flush and restore it afterwards.
This fixes the following crash caused by coprocessor register inspection
in native gdb:

  (gdb) p/x $w0
