powerpc/mm/book3s: Update pmd_present to look at _PAGE_PRESENT bit

With this patch we use 0x8000000000000000UL (_PAGE_PRESENT) to indicate a valid
pgd/pud/pmd entry. We also switch the p**_present() to look at this bit.

With pmd_present, we have a special case. We need to make sure we consider a
pmd marked invalid during THP split as present. Right now we clear the
_PAGE_PRESENT bit during a pmdp_invalidate. Inorder to consider this special
case we add a new pte bit _PAGE_INVALID (mapped to _RPAGE_SW0). This bit is
only used with _PAGE_PRESENT cleared. Hence we are not really losing a pte bit
for this special case. pmd_present is also updated to look at _PAGE_INVALID.
