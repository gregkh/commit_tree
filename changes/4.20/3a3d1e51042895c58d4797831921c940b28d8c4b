ocfs2: dlmglue: clean up timestamp handling

The handling of timestamps outside of the 1970..2038 range in the dlm
glue is rather inconsistent: on 32-bit architectures, this has always
wrapped around to negative timestamps in the 1902..1969 range, while on
64-bit kernels all timestamps are interpreted as positive 34 bit numbers
in the 1970..2514 year range.

Now that the VFS code handles 64-bit timestamps on all architectures, we
can make the behavior more consistent here, and return the same result
that we had on 64-bit already, making the file system y2038 safe in the
process.  Outside of dlmglue, it already uses 64-bit on-disk timestamps
anway, so that part is fine.

For consistency, I'm changing ocfs2_pack_timespec() to clamp anything
outside of the supported range to the minimum and maximum values.  This
avoids a possible ambiguity of values before 1970 in particular, which
used to be interpreted as times at the end of the 2514 range previously.
