platform/x86: intel_telemetry: report debugfs failure

On some Goldmont based systems such as ASRock J3455M the BIOS may not
enable the IPC1 device that provides access to the PMC and PUNIT. In
such scenarios, the IOSS and PSS resources from the platform device can
not be obtained and result in a invalid telemetry_plt_config which is an
internal data structure that holds platform config and is maintained by
the telemetry platform driver.

This is also applicable to the platforms where the BIOS supports IPC1
device under debug configurations but IPC1 is disabled by user or the
policy.

This change allows user to know the reason for not seeing entries under
/sys/kernel/debug/telemetry/* when there is no apparent failure at boot.
