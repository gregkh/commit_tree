powerpc/mm: add pte helpers to query and change pte flags

In order to avoid using generic _PAGE_XXX flags in powerpc
core functions, define helpers for all needed flags:
- pte_mkuser() and pte_mkprivileged() to set/unset and/or
unset/set _PAGE_USER and/or _PAGE_PRIVILEGED
- pte_hashpte() to check if _PAGE_HASHPTE is set.
- pte_ci() check if cache is inhibited (already existing on book3s/64)
- pte_exprotect() to protect against execution
- pte_exec() and pte_mkexec() to query and set page execution
- pte_mkpte() to set _PAGE_PTE flag.
- pte_hw_valid() to check _PAGE_PRESENT since pte_present does
something different on book3s/64.

On book3s/32 there is no exec protection, so pte_mkexec() and
pte_exprotect() are nops and pte_exec() returns always true.
