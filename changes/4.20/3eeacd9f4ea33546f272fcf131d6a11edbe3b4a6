powerpc/ptrace: Don't use sizeof(struct pt_regs) in ptrace code

Now that we've split the user & kernel versions of pt_regs we need to
be more careful in the ptrace code.

For now we've ensured the location of the fields in both structs is
the same, so most of the ptrace code doesn't need updating.

But there are a few places where we use sizeof(pt_regs), and these
will be wrong as soon as we increase the size of the kernel structure.

So flip them all to use sizeof(user_pt_regs).
