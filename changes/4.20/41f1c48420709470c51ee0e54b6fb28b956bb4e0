efi/libstub: arm: support building with clang

When building with CONFIG_EFI and CONFIG_EFI_STUB on ARM, the libstub
Makefile would use -mno-single-pic-base without checking it was
supported by the compiler. As the ARM (32-bit) clang backend does not
support this flag, the build would fail.

This changes the Makefile to check the compiler's support for
-mno-single-pic-base before using it, similar to c1c386681bd7 ("ARM:
8767/1: add support for building ARM kernel with clang").
