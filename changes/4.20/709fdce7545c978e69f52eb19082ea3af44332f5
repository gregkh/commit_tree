rcu: Express Tiny RCU updates in terms of RCU rather than RCU-sched

This commit renames Tiny RCU functions so that the lowest level of
functionality is RCU (e.g., synchronize_rcu()) rather than RCU-sched
(e.g., synchronize_sched()).  This provides greater naming compatibility
with Tree RCU, which will in turn permit more LoC removal once
the RCU-sched and RCU-bh update-side API is removed.
