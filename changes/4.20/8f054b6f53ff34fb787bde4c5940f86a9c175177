drm/panel: simple: Innolux TV123WAM is actually P120ZDG-BF1

As far as I can tell the panel that was added in commit da50bd4258db
("drm/panel: simple: Add Innolux TV123WAM panel driver support")
wasn't actually an Innolux TV123WAM but was actually an Innolux
P120ZDG-BF1.

As far as I can tell the Innolux TV123WAM isn't a real panel and but
it's a mosh between the TI TV123WAM and the Innolux P120ZDG-BF1.
Let's unmosh.

Here's my evidence:

* Searching for TV123WAM on the Internet turns up a TI panel.  While
  it's possible that an Innolux panel has the same model number as the
  TI Panel, it seems a little doubtful.  Looking up the datasheet from
  the TI Panel shows that it's 1920 x 1280 and 259.2 mm x 172.8 mm.

* As far as I know, the patch adding the Innolux Panel was supposed to
  be for the board that's sitting in front of me as I type this
  (support for that board is not yet upstream).  On the back of that
  panel I see Innolux P120ZDZ-EZ1 rev B1.

* Someone pointed me at a datasheet that's supposed to be for the
  panel in front of me (sorry, I can't share the datasheet).  That
  datasheet has the string "p120zdg-bf1"

* If I search for "P120ZDG-BF1" on the Internet I get hits for panels
  that are 2160x1440.  They don't have datasheets, but the fact that
  the resolution matches is a good sign.

In any case, let's update the name and also the physical size to match
the correct panel.
