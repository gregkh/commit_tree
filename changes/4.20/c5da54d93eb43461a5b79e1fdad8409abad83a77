nfp: bpf: copy eBPF subprograms information from kernel verifier

In order to support BPF-to-BPF calls in offloaded programs, the nfp
driver must collect information about the distinct subprograms: namely,
the number of subprograms composing the complete program and the stack
depth of those subprograms. The latter in particular is non-trivial to
collect, so we copy those elements from the kernel verifier via the
newly added post-verification hook. The struct nfp_prog is extended to
store this information. Stack depths are stored in an array of dedicated
structs.

Subprogram start indexes are not collected. Instead, meta instructions
associated to the start of a subprogram will be marked with a flag in a
later patch.
