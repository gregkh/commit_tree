eeprom: New ee1004 driver for DDR4 memory

The EEPROMs which hold the SPD data on DDR4 memory modules are no
longer standard AT24C02-compatible EEPROMs. They are 512-byte EEPROMs
which use only 1 I2C address for data access. You need to switch
between the lower page and the upper page of data by sending commands
on the SMBus.
