sparc: Fix VDSO build with older binutils.

Older versions of bintutils do not allow symbol math across different
segments on sparc:

====================
Assembler messages:
99: Error: operation combines symbols in different segments
====================

This is controlled by whether or not DIFF_EXPR_OK is defined in
gas/config/tc-*.h and for sparc this was not the case until mid-2017.

So we have to patch between %stick and %tick another way.

Do what powerpc does and emit two versions of the relevant functions,
one using %tick and one using %stick, and patch the symbols in the
dynamic symbol table.
