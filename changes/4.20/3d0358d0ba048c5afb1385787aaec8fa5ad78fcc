ARM: 8815/1: V7M: align v7m_dma_inv_range() with v7 counterpart

Chris has discovered and reported that v7_dma_inv_range() may corrupt
memory if address range is not aligned to cache line size.

Since the whole cache-v7m.S was lifted form cache-v7.S the same
observation applies to v7m_dma_inv_range(). So the fix just mirrors
what has been done for v7 with a little specific of M-class.
