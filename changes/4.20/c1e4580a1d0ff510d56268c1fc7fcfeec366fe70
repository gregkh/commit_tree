clk: at91: generated: set audio_pll_allowed in at91_clk_register_generated()

Set gck->audio_pll_allowed in at91_clk_register_generated. This makes it
easier to do it from code that is not parsing device tree.

Also, this fixes an issue where the resulting clk_hw can be dereferenced
before being tested for error.
