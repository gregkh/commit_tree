PM / tools: sleepgraph and bootgraph: upgrade to v5.2

bootgraph & sleepgraph:
- funnel all prints through the pprint function
- remove superfluous print calls, arrange them in single blocks
- flush stdout on every print, enables log capture on hang

sleepgraph:
- in -summary, if all tests have the same host+kernel+mode, add to title
- update verbose device detail print to include machine suspend/resume
- match tKernSus and tKernRes to pm_prepare/restore_console
- fully support multiple suspend/resumes in a single timeline
- enable various disk modes (disk-suspend, disk-test_resume, etc)
- add warnings when -display (xset) fails
