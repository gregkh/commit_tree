Revert "net: simplify sock_poll_wait"

This reverts commit dd979b4df817e9976f18fb6f9d134d6bc4a3c317.

This broke tcp_poll for SMC fallback: An AF_SMC socket establishes an
internal TCP socket for the initial handshake with the remote peer.
Whenever the SMC connection can not be established this TCP socket is
used as a fallback. All socket operations on the SMC socket are then
forwarded to the TCP socket. In case of poll, the file->private_data
pointer references the SMC socket because the TCP socket has no file
assigned. This causes tcp_poll to wait on the wrong socket.
