ext4: convert fault handler to use vm_fault_t type

Return type of ext4_page_mkwrite and ext4_filemap_fault are
changed to use vm_fault_t type.

With this patch all the callers of block_page_mkwrite_return()
are changed to handle vm_fault_t. So converting the return type
of block_page_mkwrite_return() to vm_fault_t.
