MAINTAINERS: Add Maxime Ripard as drm-misc maintainer

Unfortunately Gustavo has decided to step down as drm-misc maintainer to
focus on other projects. Thanks Gustavo for your dedication and hard work!

Fortunately for us, we have a wealth of people qualified to assume a
-misc maintainer role. Maxime has done an outstanding job with sun4i and
in the community in general. I'm really excited that he agreed to take
on this responsibility and I look forward to working with him!
