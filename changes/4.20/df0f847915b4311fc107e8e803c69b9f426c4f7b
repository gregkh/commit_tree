ice: Move common functions out of ice_main.c part 6/7

This patch continues the code move out of ice_main.c

The following top level functions (and related dependency functions) were
moved to ice_lib.c:
ice_vsi_setup_vector_base
ice_vsi_alloc_q_vectors
ice_vsi_get_qs

The following functions were made static again:
ice_vsi_free_arrays
ice_vsi_clear_rings

Also, in this patch, the netdev and NAPI registration logic was de-coupled
from the VSI creation logic (ice_vsi_setup) as for SR-IOV, while we want to
create VF VSIs using ice_vsi_setup, we don't want to create netdevs.
