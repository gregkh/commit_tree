net: phy: mscc: read 'vsc8531, led-%d-mode' as an u32

In the DT binding, it is specified nowhere that 'vsc8531,led-%d-mode' is
an u8, even though it's read as an u8 in the driver.

Let's update the driver to take into consideration that the
'vsc8531,led-%d-mode' property is of the default type u32.
