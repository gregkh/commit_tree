function_graph: Create function_graph_enter() to consolidate architecture code

Currently all the architectures do basically the same thing in preparing the
function graph tracer on entry to a function. This code can be pulled into a
generic location and then this will allow the function graph tracer to be
fixed, as well as extended.

Create a new function graph helper function_graph_enter() that will call the
hook function (ftrace_graph_entry) and the shadow stack operation
(ftrace_push_return_trace), and remove the need of the architecture code to
manage the shadow stack.

This is needed to prepare for a fix of a design bug on how the curr_ret_stack
is used.
