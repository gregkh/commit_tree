drm: Return -EOPNOTSUPP in drm_setclientcap() when driver do not support KMS

All DRM_CLIENT capabilities are tied to KMS support, so returning
-EOPNOTSUPP when KMS is not supported.

v2: returning -EOPNOTSUPP(same value as posix ENOTSUP and available
in uapi) instead of -ENOTSUPP

v3: adding comments about the feature requirement about capabilities
