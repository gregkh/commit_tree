ovl: untangle copy up call chain

In an attempt to dedup ~100 LOC, we ended up creating a tangled call chain,
whose branches merge and diverge in several points according to the
immutable c->tmpfile copy up mode.

This call chain was hard to analyse for locking correctness because the
locking requirements for the c->tmpfile flow were very different from the
locking requirements for the !c->tmpfile flow (i.e. directory vs.  regulare
file copy up).

Split the copy up helpers of the c->tmpfile flow from those of the
!c->tmpfile (i.e. workdir) flow and remove the c->tmpfile mode from copy up
context.
