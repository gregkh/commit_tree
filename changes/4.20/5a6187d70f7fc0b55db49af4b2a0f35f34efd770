dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Add missing residue DTC mask

The 'dtc' word in jz DMA descriptors contains two fields: The
lowest 24 bits are the transfer count, and upper 8 bits are the DOA
offset to next descriptor. The upper 8 bits are now correctly masked
off when computing residue in jz4780_dma_desc_residue(). Note that
reads of the DTCn hardware reg are automatically masked this way.
