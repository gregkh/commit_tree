nfp: bpf: update fixup function for BPF-to-BPF calls support

Relocation for targets of BPF-to-BPF calls are required at the end of
translation. Update the nfp_fixup_branches() function in that regard.

When checking that the last instruction of each bloc is a branch, we
must account for the length of the instructions required to pop the
return address from the stack.
