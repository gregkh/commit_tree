powerpc/mm/radix: Simplify split mapping logic

If we look closely at the logic in create_physical_mapping(), when
we're doing STRICT_KERNEL_RWX, we do the following steps:
  - determine the gap from where we are to the end of the range
  - choose an appropriate mapping_size based on the gap
  - check if that mapping_size would overlap the __init_begin
    boundary, and if not choose an appropriate mapping_size

We can simplify the logic by taking the __init_begin boundary into
account when we calculate the initial gap.

So add a next_boundary() function which tells us what the next
boundary is, either the __init_begin boundary or end. In future we can
add more boundaries.
