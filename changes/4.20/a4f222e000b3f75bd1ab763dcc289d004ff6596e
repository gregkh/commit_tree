selftests: gpio: restructure Makefile

This patch cleans up the Makefile by restructuring a couple of
things, namely:
1) change explicit paths in targets for variables
2) substitute a variable (BINARIES) for another, part of the
   selftests build system (TEST_PROGS_EXTENDED)
3) proper cleaning up of the EXTRA objects

The resulting Makefile is much more readable and manageable.
