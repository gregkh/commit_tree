net: hns3: bugfix for buffer not free problem during resetting

When hns3_get_ring_config()/hns3_queue_to_ring()/
hns3_get_vector_ring_chain() failed during resetting, the allocated
memory has not been freed before these three functions return. So
this patch adds error handler in these functions to fix it.
