rcu: Report expedited grace periods at context-switch time

This commit reduces the latency of expedited RCU grace periods by
reporting a quiescent state for the CPU at context-switch time.
In CONFIG_PREEMPT=y kernels, if the outgoing task is still within an
RCU read-side critical section (and thus still blocking some grace
period, perhaps including this expedited grace period), then that task
will already have been placed on one of the leaf rcu_node structures'
->blkd_tasks list.
