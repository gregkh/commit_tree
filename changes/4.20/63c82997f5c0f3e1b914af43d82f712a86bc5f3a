net: sched: cls_flower: validate nested enc_opts_policy to avoid warning

TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS and TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_MASK can only
currently contain further nested attributes, which are parsed by
hand, so the policy is never actually used resulting in a W=1
build warning:

net/sched/cls_flower.c:492:1: warning: ‘enc_opts_policy’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 enc_opts_policy[TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_MAX + 1] = {

Add the validation anyway to avoid potential bugs when other
attributes are added and to make the attribute structure slightly
more clear.  Validation will also set extact to point to bad
attribute on error.
