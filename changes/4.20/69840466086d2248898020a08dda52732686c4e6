block: fix the DISCARD request merge

There are two cases when handle DISCARD merge.
If max_discard_segments == 1, the bios/requests need to be contiguous
to merge. If max_discard_segments > 1, it takes every bio as a range
and different range needn't to be contiguous.

But now, attempt_merge screws this up. It always consider contiguity
for DISCARD for the case max_discard_segments > 1 and cannot merge
contiguous DISCARD for the case max_discard_segments == 1, because
rq_attempt_discard_merge always returns false in this case.
This patch fixes both of the two cases above.
