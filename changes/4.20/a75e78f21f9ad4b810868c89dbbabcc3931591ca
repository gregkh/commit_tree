kernfs: Fix range checks in kernfs_get_target_path

The terminating NUL byte is only there because the buffer is
allocated with kzalloc(PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL), but since the
range-check is off-by-one, and PAGE_SIZE==PATH_MAX, the
returned string may not be zero-terminated if it is exactly
PATH_MAX characters long.  Furthermore also the initial loop
may theoretically exceed PATH_MAX and cause a fault.
