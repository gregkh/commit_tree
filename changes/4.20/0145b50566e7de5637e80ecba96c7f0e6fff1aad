iio/hid-sensors: Fix IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW returning wrong values for signed numbers

Before this commit sensor_hub_input_attr_get_raw_value() failed to take
the signedness of 16 and 8 bit values into account, returning e.g.
65436 instead of -100 for the z-axis reading of an accelerometer.

This commit adds a new is_signed parameter to the function and makes all
callers pass the appropriate value for this.

While at it, this commit also fixes up some neighboring lines where
statements were needlessly split over 2 lines to improve readability.
