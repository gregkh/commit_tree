net: hns3: Fix for multicast failure

When the lower 24 bits of the IPV6 link-local addresses at both
ends are the same, the multicast MAC address for Neigbour Discovery
is the same. The multicast for Neigbour Discovery will fail.

This patch fixes it by including the bonding uplink port in the
multicast group.
