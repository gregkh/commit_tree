perf script: Make itrace script default to all calls

By default 'perf script' for itrace outputs sampled instructions or
branches. In my experience this is confusing to users because it's hard
to correlate with real program behavior. The sampling makes sense for
tools like 'perf report' that actually sample to reduce the run time,
but run time is normally not a problem for 'perf script'.  It's better
to give an accurate representation of the program flow.

Default 'perf script' to output all calls for itrace. That's a much saner
default. The old behavior can be still requested with 'perf script'
--itrace=ibxwpe100000
