staging: erofs: drop multiref support temporarily

Multiref support means that a compressed page could have
more than one reference, which is designed for on-disk data
deduplication. However, mkfs doesn't support this mode
at this moment, and the kernel implementation is also broken.

Let's drop multiref support. If it is fully implemented
in the future, it can be reverted later.
