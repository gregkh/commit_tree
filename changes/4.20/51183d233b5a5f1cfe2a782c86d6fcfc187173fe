net/neighbor: Update neigh_dump_info for strict data checking

Update neigh_dump_info for strict data checking. If the flag is set,
the dump request is expected to have an ndmsg struct as the header
potentially followed by one or more attributes. Any data passed in the
header or as an attribute is taken as a request to influence the data
returned. Only values supported by the dump handler are allowed to be
non-0 or set in the request. At the moment only the NDA_IFINDEX and
NDA_MASTER attributes are supported.

Existing code does not fail the dump if nlmsg_parse fails. That behavior
is kept for non-strict checking.
