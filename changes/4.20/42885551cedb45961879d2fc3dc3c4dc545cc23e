pwm: lpss: Release runtime-pm reference from the driver's remove callback

For each pwm output which gets enabled through pwm_lpss_apply(), we do a
pm_runtime_get_sync().

This commit adds pm_runtime_put() calls to pwm_lpss_remove() to balance
these when the driver gets removed with some of the outputs still enabled.
