drm/vmwgfx: Make the object handles idr-generated

Instead of generating user-space object handles based on a, possibly
processed, hash of the kernel address of the object, use idr to generate
and lookup those handles. This might improve somewhat on security since
we loose all connections to the object's kernel address. Also idr is
designed to do just this.

As a todo-item, since user-space handles are now generated in sequence,
we can probably use a much simpler hash function to hash them.
