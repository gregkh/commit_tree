mips: switch to NO_BOOTMEM

MIPS already has memblock support and all the memory is already registered
with it.

This patch replaces bootmem memory reservations with memblock ones and
removes the bootmem initialization.

Since memblock allocates memory in top-down mode, we ensure that memblock
limit is max_low_pfn to prevent allocations from the high memory.

To have the exceptions base in the lower 512M of the physical memory, its
allocation in arch/mips/kernel/traps.c::traps_init() is using bottom-up
mode.
