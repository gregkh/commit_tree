usb: usbtmc: Add ioctl USBTMC_IOCTL_CLEANUP_IO

The ioctl USBTMC_IOCTL_CLEANUP_IO kills all submitted urbs to OUT
and IN bulk, and clears all received data from IN bulk. Internal
transfer counters and error states are reset.

An application should use this ioctl after an asnychronous transfer
was canceled and/or error handling has finished.
