parisc: Revert "Release spinlocks using ordered store"

This reverts commit d27dfa13b9f77ae7e6ed09d70a0426ed26c1a8f9.

Unfortunately, this patch needs to be reverted.  We need the full sync
barrier and not the limited barrier provided by using an ordered store.
The sync ensures that all accesses and cache purge instructions that
follow the sync are performed after all such instructions prior the sync
instruction have completed executing.

The patch breaks the rwlock implementation in glibc.  This caused the
test-lock application in the libprelude testsuite to hang.  With the
change reverted, the test runs correctly and the libprelude package
builds successfully.
