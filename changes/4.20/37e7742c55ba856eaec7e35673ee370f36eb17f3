clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Fix clocksource width for 32-bit machines

The driver seems to abuse *unsigned long* not only for the (32-bit)
register values but also for the 'sh_cmt_channel::total_cycles' which
needs to always be 64-bit -- as a result, the clocksource's mask is
needlessly clamped down to 32-bits on the 32-bit machines...
