drm/msm/dpu: Make dpu_plane_danger_signal_ctrl void

Removed all impossible checks from the function, which eliminates
the need for a return value. This function is also never used
outside of dpu_plane.c, so the function is made static.

v3: Using helper function _dpu_plane_get_kms() instead of doing
it locally.
