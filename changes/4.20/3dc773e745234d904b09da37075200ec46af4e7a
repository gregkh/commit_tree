x86/kvm/mmu.c: set get_pdptr hook in kvm_init_shadow_ept_mmu()

kvm_init_shadow_ept_mmu() doesn't set get_pdptr() hook and is this
not a problem just because MMU context is already initialized and this
hook points to kvm_pdptr_read(). As we're intended to use a dedicated
MMU for shadow EPT MMU set this hook explicitly.
