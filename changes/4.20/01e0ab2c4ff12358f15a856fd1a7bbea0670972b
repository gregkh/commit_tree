arm64: function_graph: Simplify with function_graph_enter()

The function_graph_enter() function does the work of calling the function
graph hook function and the management of the shadow stack, simplifying the
work done in the architecture dependent prepare_ftrace_return().

Have arm64 use the new code, and remove the shadow stack management as well as
having to set up the trace structure.

This is needed to prepare for a fix of a design bug on how the curr_ret_stack
is used.
