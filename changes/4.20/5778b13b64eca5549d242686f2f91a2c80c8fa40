net: hns: Fixed bug that netdev was opened twice

After resetting dsaf to try to repair chip error such as ecc error,
the net device will be open if net interface is up. But at this time
if there is the users set the net device up with the command ifconfig,
the net device will be opened twice consecutively.

Function napi_enable was called when open device. And Kernel panic will
be occurred if it was called twice consecutively. Such as follow:
static inline void napi_enable(struct napi_struct *n)
{
         BUG_ON(!test_bit(NAPI_STATE_SCHED, &n->state));
         smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
         clear_bit(NAPI_STATE_SCHED, &n->state);
}
