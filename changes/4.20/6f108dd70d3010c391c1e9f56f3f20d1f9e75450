i2c: Clear client->irq in i2c_device_remove

The IRQ will be mapped in i2c_device_probe only if client->irq is zero and
i2c_device_remove does not clear this. When rebinding an I2C device,
whos IRQ provider has also been rebound this means that an IRQ mapping
will never be created, causing the I2C device to fail to acquire its
IRQ. Fix this issue by clearing client->irq in i2c_device_remove,
forcing i2c_device_probe to lookup the mapping again.
