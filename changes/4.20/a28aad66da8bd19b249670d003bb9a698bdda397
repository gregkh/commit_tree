firmware: coreboot: Collapse platform drivers into bus core

The DT based and ACPI based platform drivers here do the same thing; map
some memory and hand it over to the coreboot bus to populate devices.
The only major difference is that the DT based driver doesn't map the
coreboot table header to figure out how large of a region to map for the
whole coreboot table and it uses of_iomap() instead of ioremap_cache().
A cached or non-cached mapping shouldn't matter here and mapping some
smaller region first before mapping the whole table is just more work
but should be OK. In the end, we can remove two files and combine the
code all in one place making it easier to reason about things.

We leave the old Kconfigs in place for a little while longer but make
them hidden and select the previously hidden config option. This way
users can upgrade without having to know to reselect this config in the
future. Later on we can remove the old hidden configs.
