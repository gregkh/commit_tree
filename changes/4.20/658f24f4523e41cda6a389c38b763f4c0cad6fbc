usb: usbtmc: Add ioctl for generic requests on control

Add USBTMC_IOCTL_CTRL_REQUEST to send arbitrary requests on the
control pipe.  Used by specific applications of IVI Foundation,
Inc. to implement VISA API functions: viUsbControlIn/Out.

The maximum length of control request is set to 4k.

This ioctl does not support compatibility for 32 bit
applications running on 64 bit systems. However all other
convenient ioctls of the USBTMC driver can still be used in 32
bit applications as well. Note that 32 bit applications running
on 32 bit target systems are not affected by this limitation.
