pstore: Allocate compression during late_initcall()

ramoops's call of pstore_register() was recently moved to run during
late_initcall() because the crypto backend may not have been ready during
postcore_initcall(). This meant early-boot crash dumps were not getting
caught by pstore any more.

Instead, lets allow calls to pstore_register() earlier, and once crypto
is ready we can initialize the compression.
