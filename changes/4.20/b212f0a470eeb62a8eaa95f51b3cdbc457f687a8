drm/i915/icl: Fix context RPCS programming

There are two issues with the current RPCS programming for Icelake:

Expansion of the slice count bitfield has been missed, as well as the
required programming workaround for the subslice count bitfield size
limitation.

1)

Bitfield width for configuring the active slice count has grown so we need
to program the GEN8_R_PWR_CLK_STATE accordingly.

Current code was always requesting eight times the number of slices (due
writing to a bitfield starting three bits higher than it should). These
requests were luckily a) capped by the hardware to the available number of
slices, and b) we haven't yet exported the code to ask for reduced slice
configurations.

Due both of the above there was no impact from this incorrect programming
but we should still fix it.

2)

Due subslice count bitfield being only three bits wide and furthermore
capped to a maximum documented value of four, special programming
workaround is needed to enable more than four subslices.

With this programming driver has to consider the GT configuration as
2x4x8, while the hardware internally translates this to 1x8x8.

A limitation stemming from this is that either a subslice count between
one and four can be selected, or a subslice count equaling the total
number of subslices in all selected slices. In other words, odd subslice
counts greater than four are impossible, as are odd subslice counts
greater than a single slice subslice count.

This also had no impact in the current code base due breakage from 1)
always reqesting more than one slice.

While fixing this we also add some asserts to flag up any future bitfield
overflows.

v2:
 * Use a local in all branches for clarity. (Lionel)
