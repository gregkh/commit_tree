selftests/powerpc/signal: Fix out-of-tree build

We should use TEST_GEN_PROGS, not TEST_PROGS. That tells the selftests
makefile (lib.mk) that those tests are generated (built), and so it
adds the $(OUTPUT) prefix for us, making the out-of-tree build work
correctly.

It also means we don't need our own clean rule, lib.mk does it.

We also have to update the signal_tm rule to use $(OUTPUT).
