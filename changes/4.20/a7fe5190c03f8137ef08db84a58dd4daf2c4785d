cpuidle: menu: Remove get_loadavg() from the performance multiplier

The function get_loadavg() returns almost always zero. To be more
precise, statistically speaking for a total of 1023379 times passing
in the function, the load is equal to zero 1020728 times, greater than
100, 610 times, the remaining is between 0 and 5.

In 2011, the get_loadavg() was removed from the Android tree because
of the above [1]. At this time, the load was:

unsigned long this_cpu_load(void)
{
        struct rq *this = this_rq();
        return this->cpu_load[0];
}

In 2014, the code was changed by commit 372ba8cb46b2 (cpuidle: menu: Lookup CPU
runqueues less) and the load is:

void get_iowait_load(unsigned long *nr_waiters, unsigned long *load)
{
        struct rq *rq = this_rq();
        *nr_waiters = atomic_read(&rq->nr_iowait);
        *load = rq->load.weight;
}

with the same result.

Both measurements show using the load in this code path does no matter
anymore. Removing it.
