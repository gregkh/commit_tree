drm/omap: dsi: Ensure the device is active during probe

The probe function performs hardware access to read the number of
supported data lanes from a configuration register and thus requires the
device to be active. Ensure this by surrounding the access with
dsi_runtime_get() and dsi_runtime_put() calls.
