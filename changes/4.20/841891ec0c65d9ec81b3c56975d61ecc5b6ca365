rtnetlink: Update rtnl_stats_dump for strict data checking

Update rtnl_stats_dump for strict data checking. If the flag is set,
the dump request is expected to have an if_stats_msg struct as the header.
All elements of the struct are expected to be 0 except filter_mask which
must be non-0 (legacy behavior). No attributes are supported.
