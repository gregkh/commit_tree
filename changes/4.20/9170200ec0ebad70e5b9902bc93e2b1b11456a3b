KVM: x86: hyperv: enforce vp_index < KVM_MAX_VCPUS

Hyper-V TLFS (5.0b) states:

> Virtual processors are identified by using an index (VP index). The
> maximum number of virtual processors per partition supported by the
> current implementation of the hypervisor can be obtained through CPUID
> leaf 0x40000005. A virtual processor index must be less than the
> maximum number of virtual processors per partition.

Forbid userspace to set VP_INDEX above KVM_MAX_VCPUS. get_vcpu_by_vpidx()
can now be optimized to bail early when supplied vpidx is >= KVM_MAX_VCPUS.
