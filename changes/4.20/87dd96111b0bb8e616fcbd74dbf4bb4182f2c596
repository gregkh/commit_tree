usb: dwc3: gadget: Check ENBLSLPM before sending ep command

When operating in USB 2.0 speeds (HS/FS), if GUSB2PHYCFG.ENBLSLPM or
GUSB2PHYCFG.SUSPHY is set, it must be cleared before issuing an endpoint
command.

Current implementation only save and restore GUSB2PHYCFG.SUSPHY
configuration. We must save and clear both GUSB2PHYCFG.ENBLSLPM and
GUSB2PHYCFG.SUSPHY settings. Restore them after the command is
completed.
