perf intel-pt: Add decoder flags for trace begin / end

Previously, the decoder would indicate begin / end by a branch from / to
zero. That hides useful information, in particular when a trace ends
with a call. To prepare for remedying that, add Intel PT decoder flags
for trace begin / end and map them to the existing sample flags.
