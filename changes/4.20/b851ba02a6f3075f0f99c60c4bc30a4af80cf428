powerpc/64/module: REL32 relocation range check

The recent module relocation overflow crash demonstrated that we
have no range checking on REL32 relative relocations. This patch
implements a basic check, the same kernel that previously oopsed
and rebooted now continues with some of these errors when loading
the module:

  module_64: x_tables: REL32 527703503449812 out of range!

Possibly other relocations (ADDR32, REL16, TOC16, etc.) should also have
overflow checks.
