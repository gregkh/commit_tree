scsi: hisi_sas: Update v3 hw AIP_LIMIT and CFG_AGING_TIME register values

Update registers as follows:
- Default value of AIP timer is 1ms, and it is easy for some expanders to
  cause IO error. Change the value to max value 65ms to avoid IO error for
  those expanders.

- A CQ completion will be reported by HW when 4 CQs have occurred or the
  aging timer expires, whichever happens first. Sor serial IO scenario, it
  will still wait 8us for every IO before it is reported. So in the
  situation, the performance is poor. So to improve it, change the limit
  time to the least value.
  For other scenario, it does little affect to the performance.
