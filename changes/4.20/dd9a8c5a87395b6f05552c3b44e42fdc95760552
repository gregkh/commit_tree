powerpc/tm: Fix HFSCR bit for no suspend case

Currently on P9N DD2.1 we end up taking infinite TM facility
unavailable exceptions on the first TM usage by userspace.

In the special case of TM no suspend (P9N DD2.1), Linux is told TM is
off via CPU dt-ftrs but told to (partially) use it via
OPAL_REINIT_CPUS_TM_SUSPEND_DISABLED. So HFSCR[TM] will be off from
dt-ftrs but we need to turn it on for the no suspend case.

This patch fixes this by enabling HFSCR TM in this case.
