pinctrl: mediatek: add advanced pull related support to pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.c

There are some specific pins (i.e. MMC/SD) need specific registers to
turn on/off the 10K & 50k(75K) resistors when pull up/down.

Therefore, this patch adds the custom prarmeters so that the user could
control it through device tree.
