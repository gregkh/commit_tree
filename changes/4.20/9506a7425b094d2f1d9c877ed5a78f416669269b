locking/lockdep: Fix debug_locks off performance problem

It was found that when debug_locks was turned off because of a problem
found by the lockdep code, the system performance could drop quite
significantly when the lock_stat code was also configured into the
kernel. For instance, parallel kernel build time on a 4-socket x86-64
server nearly doubled.

Further analysis into the cause of the slowdown traced back to the
frequent call to debug_locks_off() from the __lock_acquired() function
probably due to some inconsistent lockdep states with debug_locks
off. The debug_locks_off() function did an unconditional atomic xchg
to write a 0 value into debug_locks which had already been set to 0.
This led to severe cacheline contention in the cacheline that held
debug_locks.  As debug_locks is being referenced in quite a few different
places in the kernel, this greatly slow down the system performance.

To prevent that trashing of debug_locks cacheline, lock_acquired()
and lock_contended() now checks the state of debug_locks before
proceeding. The debug_locks_off() function is also modified to check
debug_locks before calling __debug_locks_off().
