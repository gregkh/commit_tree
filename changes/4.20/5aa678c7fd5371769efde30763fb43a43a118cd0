usb: dwc2: fix call to vbus supply exit routine, call it unlocked

dwc2_vbus_supply_exit() may call regulator_disable(). It shouldn't be
called with interrupts disabled as it might sleep.
This is seen with DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y.

Fixes: 531ef5ebea96 ("usb: dwc2: add support for host mode external
vbus supply")
