gpiolib: Identify arrays matching GPIO hardware

Certain GPIO array lookup results may map directly to GPIO pins of a
single GPIO chip in hardware order.  If that condition is recognized
and handled efficiently, significant performance gain of get/set array
functions may be possible.

While processing a request for an array of GPIO descriptors, identify
those which represent corresponding pins of a single GPIO chip.  Skip
over pins which require open source or open drain special processing.
Moreover, identify pins which require inversion.  Pass a pointer to
that information with the array to the caller so it can benefit from
enhanced performance as soon as get/set array functions can accept and
make efficient use of it.
