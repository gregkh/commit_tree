xhci: Add check for invalid byte size error when UAS devices are connected.

Observed "TRB completion code (27)" error which corresponds to Stopped -
Length Invalid error(xhci spec section 4.17.4) while connecting USB to
SATA bridge.

Looks like this case was not considered when the following patch[1] was
committed. Hence adding this new check which can prevent
the invalid byte size error.
