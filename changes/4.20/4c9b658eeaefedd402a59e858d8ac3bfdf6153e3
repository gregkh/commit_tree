igb: shorten maximum PHC timecounter update interval

The timecounter needs to be updated at least once per ~550 seconds in
order to avoid a 40-bit SYSTIM timestamp to be misinterpreted as an old
timestamp.

Since commit 500462a9de65 ("timers: Switch to a non-cascading wheel"),
scheduling of delayed work seems to be less accurate and a requested
delay of 540 seconds may actually be longer than 550 seconds. Also, the
PHC may be adjusted to run up to 6% faster than real time and the system
clock up to 10% slower. Shorten the delay to 360 seconds to be sure the
timecounter is updated in time.

This fixes an issue with HW timestamps on 82580/I350/I354 being off by
~1100 seconds for few seconds every ~9 minutes.
