scsi: NCR5380: Don't call dsprintk() following reselection interrupt

The X3T9.2 specification (draft) says, under "6.1.4.1 RESELECTION",

    ... The reselected initiator shall then assert the BSY signal
    within a selection abort time of its most recent detection of being
    reselected; this is required for correct operation of the time-out
    procedure.

The selection abort time is only 200 us which may be insufficient time for a
printk() call. Move the diagnostics to the error paths.
