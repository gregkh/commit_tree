modpost: Create macro to avoid variable shadowing

Create DEF_FIELD_ADDR_VAR as a more generic version of the DEF_FIELD_ADD
macro, allowing usage of a variable name other than the struct element name.
Also, sets DEF_FIELD_ADDR as a specific usage of DEF_FILD_ADDR_VAR in which
the var name is the same as the struct element name.
Then, makes use of DEF_FIELD_ADDR_VAR to create a variable of another name,
in order to avoid variable shadowing.
