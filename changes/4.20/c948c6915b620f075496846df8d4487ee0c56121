staging: rtl8723bs: Fix incorrect sense of ether_addr_equal

In commit b37f9e1c3801 ("staging: rtl8723bs: Fix lines too long in
update_recvframe_attrib()."), the refactoring involved replacing
two memcmp() calls with ether_addr_equal() calls. What the author
missed is that memcmp() returns false when the two strings are equal,
whereas ether_addr_equal() returns true when the two addresses are
equal. One side effect of this error is that the strength of an
unassociated AP was much stronger than the same AP after association.
This bug is reported at bko#201611.
