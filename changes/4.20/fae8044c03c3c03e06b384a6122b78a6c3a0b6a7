smb3: show number of current open files in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats

To allow better debugging (for example applications with
handle leaks, or complex reconnect scenarios) display the
number of open files (on the client) and number of open
server file handles for each tcon in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats.
Note that open files on server is one larger than local
due to handle caching (in this case of the root of
the share).  In this example there are two local
open files, and three (two file and one directory handle)
open on the server.

Sample output:

$ cat /proc/fs/cifs/Stats
