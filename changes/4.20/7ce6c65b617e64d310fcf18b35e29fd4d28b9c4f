i2c: sh_mobile: Remove dummy runtime PM callbacks

Platform drivers don't need dummy runtime PM callbacks that just return
success and non-NULL pm pointer in their struct device_driver in order
to have runtime PM happening. This has changed since following commits:

05aa55dddb9e ("PM / Runtime: Lenient generic runtime pm callbacks")
543f2503a956 ("PM / platform_bus: Allow runtime PM by default")
8b313a38ecff ("PM / Platform: Use generic runtime PM callbacks directly")
