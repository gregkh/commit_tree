9p locks: fix glock.client_id leak in do_lock

the 9p client code overwrites our glock.client_id pointing to a static
buffer by an allocated string holding the network provided value which
we do not care about; free and reset the value as appropriate.

This is almost identical to the leak in v9fs_file_getlock() fixed by
Al Viro in commit ce85dd58ad5a6 ("9p: we are leaking glock.client_id
in v9fs_file_getlock()"), which was returned as an error by a coverity
false positive -- while we are here attempt to make the code slightly
more robust to future change of the net/9p/client code and hopefully
more clear to coverity that there is no problem.
