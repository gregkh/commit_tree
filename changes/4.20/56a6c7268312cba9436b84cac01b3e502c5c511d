gnss: serial: fix synchronous write timeout

Passing a timeout of zero to the synchronous serdev_device_write()
helper does currently not imply to wait forever (unlike passing zero to
serdev_device_wait_until_sent()). Instead, if there's insufficient
room in the write buffer, we'd end up with an incomplete write.
