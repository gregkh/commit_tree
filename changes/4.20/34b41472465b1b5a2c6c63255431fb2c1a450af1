media: media-request: return -EINVAL for invalid request_fds

Instead of returning -ENOENT when a request_fd was not found (VIDIOC_QBUF
and VIDIOC_G/S/TRY_EXT_CTRLS), we now return -EINVAL. This is in line
with what we do when invalid dmabuf fds are passed to e.g. VIDIOC_QBUF.

Also document that EINVAL is returned for invalid m.fd values, we never
documented that.
