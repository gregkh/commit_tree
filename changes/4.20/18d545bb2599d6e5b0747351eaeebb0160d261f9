ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Add overflow detection support

Similar to short circuit detection, when the ADC/DAC is saturated and
overflows poor audio quality can result and should be reported to the
user. This device support Automatic Dynamic Range Compression (DRC)
to reduce this but it is not enabled currently in this driver.
