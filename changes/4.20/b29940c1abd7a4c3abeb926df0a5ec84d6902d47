mm: rename and change semantics of nr_indirectly_reclaimable_bytes

The vmstat counter NR_INDIRECTLY_RECLAIMABLE_BYTES was introduced by
commit eb59254608bc ("mm: introduce NR_INDIRECTLY_RECLAIMABLE_BYTES") with
the goal of accounting objects that can be reclaimed, but cannot be
allocated via a SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT cache.  This is now possible via
kmalloc() with __GFP_RECLAIMABLE flag, and the dcache external names user
is converted.

The counter is however still useful for accounting direct page allocations
(i.e.  not slab) with a shrinker, such as the ION page pool.  So keep it,
and:

- change granularity to pages to be more like other counters; sub-page
  allocations should be able to use kmalloc
- rename the counter to NR_KERNEL_MISC_RECLAIMABLE
- expose the counter again in vmstat as "nr_kernel_misc_reclaimable"; we can
  again remove the check for not printing "hidden" counters
