modpost: remove leftover symbol prefix handling for module device table

Blackfin and metag were the only architectures that prefix symbols with
an underscore. They were removed by commit 4ba66a976072 ("arch: remove
blackfin port"), commit bb6fb6dfcc17 ("metag: Remove arch/metag/"),
respectively.

It is no longer necessary to handle <prefix> part of module device
table symbols.
