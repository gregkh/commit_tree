veth: Account for XDP packet statistics on rx side

On XDP path veth has napi handler so we can collect statistics on
per-queue basis for XDP.

By this change now we can collect XDP_DROP drop count as well as packets
and bytes coming through ndo_xdp_xmit. Packet counters shown by
"ip -s link", sysfs stats or /proc/net/dev is now correct for XDP.
