irqchip/gic-v3-its: Move pending table allocation to init time

Pending tables for the redistributors are currently allocated
one at a time as each CPU boots. This is causing some grief
for Linux/RT (allocation from within a CPU hotplug notifier is
frown upon).

Let's move this allocation to take place at init time, when we
only have a single CPU. It means we're allocating memory for CPUs
that are not online yet, but most system will boot all of their
CPUs anyway, so that's not completely wasted.
