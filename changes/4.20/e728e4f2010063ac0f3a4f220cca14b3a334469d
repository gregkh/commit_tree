ARM: s3c24xx: formatting cleanup in mach-mini2440.c

Running:
    scripts/checkpatch.pl -f arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/mach-mini2440.c
revealed several errors and warnings.

They were all removed, except one which is an #if 0 around the declaration
of a gpio pin. This needs some more investigation and I prefer to let it
here. This is not some dead code.

'printk' was replaced by 'pr_info'.
