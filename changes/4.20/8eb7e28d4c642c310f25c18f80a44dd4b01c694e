arm64/mm: move runtime pgds to rodata

Now that deliberate writes to swapper_pg_dir are made via the fixmap, we
can defend against errant writes by moving it into the rodata section.
Since tramp_pg_dir and reserved_ttbr0 must be at a fixed offset from
swapper_pg_dir, and are not modified at runtime, these are also moved
into the rodata section. Likewise, idmap_pg_dir is not modified at
runtime, and is moved into rodata.
