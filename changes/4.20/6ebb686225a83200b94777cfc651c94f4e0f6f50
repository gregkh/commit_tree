perf trace augmented_syscalls: Augment sendto's 'addr' arg

Its a 'struct sockaddr' pointer, augment it with the same beautifier as
for 'connect' and 'bind', that all receive from userspace that pointer.

Doing it in the other direction remains to be done, hooking at the
syscalls:sys_exit_{accept4?,recvmsg} tracepoints somehow.
