lightnvm: pblk: recover open lines on 2.0 devices

In the OCSSD 2.0 spec, each chunk reports its write pointer. This means
that pblk does not need to scan open lines to find the write pointer,
but instead, it can retrieve it directly (and verify it).

This patch uses the write pointer on open lines to (i) recover the line
up until the last written lba and (ii) reconstruct the map bitmap and
rest of line metadata so that the line can be used for new data.

Since the 1.2 path in lightnvm core has been re-implemented to populate
the chunk structure and thus recover the write pointer on
initialization, this patch removes 1.2 specific recovery, as the 2.0
path can be reused.
