cpuidle: enter_state: Don't needlessly calculate diff time

Currently, ktime_us_delta() is invoked unconditionally to compute the
idle residency of the CPU, but it only makes sense to do that if a
valid idle state has been entered, so move the ktime_us_delta()
invocation after the entered_state >= 0 check.

While at it, merge two comment blocks in there into one and drop
a space between type casting of diff.

This patch has no functional changes.
