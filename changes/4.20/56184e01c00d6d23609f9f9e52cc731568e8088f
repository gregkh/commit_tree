iavf: rename most of i40e strings

This is the big rename patch, it takes most of the i40e_
and I40E_ strings and renames them to iavf_ and IAVF_.

Some of the adminq code, as well as most of the client
interface code used by RDMA is left unchanged in order
to indicate that the driver is talking to non-internal to
iavf code.
