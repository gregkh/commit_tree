s390/mm: optimize debugfs ptdump kasan zero page walking

Kasan zero p4d/pud/pmd/pte are always filled in with corresponding
kasan zero entries. Walking kasan zero page backed area is time
consuming and unnecessary. When kasan zero p4d/pud/pmd is encountered,
it eventually points to the kasan zero page always with the same
attributes and nothing but it, therefore zero p4d/pud/pmd could
be jumped over.

Also adds a space between address range and pages number to separate
them from each other when pages number is huge.
