KVM: x86: hyperv: implement PV IPI send hypercalls

Using hypercall for sending IPIs is faster because this allows to specify
any number of vCPUs (even > 64 with sparse CPU set), the whole procedure
will take only one VMEXIT.

Current Hyper-V TLFS (v5.0b) claims that HvCallSendSyntheticClusterIpi
hypercall can't be 'fast' (passing parameters through registers) but
apparently this is not true, Windows always uses it as 'fast' so we need
to support that.
