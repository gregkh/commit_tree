PCI/AER: Use kfifo for tracking events instead of reimplementing it

The kernel provides a generic FIFO implementation, so no need to reinvent
that capability in a driver.  Replace the AER-specific implementation with
the kernel-provided kfifo.  Since the interrupt handler producer and work
queue consumer run single threaded, there is no need for additional
locking, so remove that lock, too.
