mfd: arizona: Correct calling of runtime_put_sync

Don't call runtime_put_sync when clk32k_ref is ARIZONA_32KZ_MCLK2
as there is no corresponding runtime_get_sync call.

MCLK1 is not in the AoD power domain so if it is used as 32kHz clock
source we need to hold a runtime PM reference to keep the device from
going into low power mode.
