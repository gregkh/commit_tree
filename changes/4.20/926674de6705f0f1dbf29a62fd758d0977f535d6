smb3: on kerberos mount if server doesn't specify auth type use krb5

Some servers (e.g. Azure) do not include a spnego blob in the SMB3
negotiate protocol response, so on kerberos mounts ("sec=krb5")
we can fail, as we expected the server to list its supported
auth types (OIDs in the spnego blob in the negprot response).
Change this so that on krb5 mounts we default to trying krb5 if the
server doesn't list its supported protocol mechanisms.
