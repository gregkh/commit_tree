lightnvm: pblk: consider max hw sectors supported for max_write_pgs

When do GC, the number of read/write sectors are determined
by max_write_pgs(see gc_rq preparation in pblk_gc_line_prepare_ws).

Due to max_write_pgs doesn't consider max hw sectors
supported by nvme controller(128K), which leads to GC
tries to read 64 * 4K in one command, and see below error
caused by pblk_bio_map_addr in function pblk_submit_read_gc.

[ 2923.005376] pblk: could not add page to bio
[ 2923.005377] pblk: could not allocate GC bio (18446744073709551604)
