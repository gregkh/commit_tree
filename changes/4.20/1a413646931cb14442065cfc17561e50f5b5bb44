tmpfs: make lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEK_HOLE) return ENXIO with a negative offset

Other filesystems such as ext4, f2fs and ubifs all return ENXIO when
lseek (SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE) requests a negative offset.

man 2 lseek says

:      EINVAL whence  is  not  valid.   Or: the resulting file offset would be
:             negative, or beyond the end of a seekable device.
:
:      ENXIO  whence is SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, and the file offset is  beyond
:             the end of the file.

Make tmpfs return ENXIO under these circumstances as well.  After this,
tmpfs also passes xfstests's generic/448.
