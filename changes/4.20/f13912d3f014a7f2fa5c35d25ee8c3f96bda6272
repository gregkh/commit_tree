usbcore: Select UAC3 configuration for audio if present

USB audio class 3.0 specification introduced many significant
changes like
 - new power domains, support for LPM/L1
 - new cluster descriptor
 - new high capability and class-specific string descriptors
 - BADD profiles
 - ... and many other things (check spec from link below:
http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/USB_Audio_v3.0.zip)

Now that UAC3 is supported in linux, choose UAC3
configuration for audio if the device supports it.
Selecting this configuration will enable the system to
save power by leveraging the new power domains and LPM L1
capability and also support new codec types and data formats
for consumer audio applications.
