rcutorture: Maintain self-propagating CB only during forward-progress test

The current forward-progress testing maintains a self-propagating
callback during the full test.  This could result in false negatives
for stutter-end checking, where it might appear that RCU was clearing
out old callbacks only because it was being continually motivated by
the self-propagating callback.  This commit therefore shuts down the
self-propagating callback at the end of each forward-progress test
interval.
