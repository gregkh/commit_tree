powerpc/powernv: Make possible for user to force a full ipl cec reboot

Ever since fast reboot is enabled by default in opal,
opal_cec_reboot() will use fast-reset instead of full IPL to perform
system reboot. This leaves the user with no direct way to force a full
IPL reboot except changing an nvram setting that persistently disables
fast-reset for all subsequent reboots.

This patch provides a more direct way for the user to force a one-shot
full IPL reboot by passing the command line argument 'full' to the
reboot command. So the user will be able to tweak the reboot behavior
via:

  $ sudo reboot full	# Force a full ipl reboot skipping fast-reset

  or
  $ sudo reboot  	# default reboot path (usually fast-reset)

The reboot command passes the un-parsed command argument to the kernel
via the 'Reboot' syscall which is then passed on to the arch function
pnv_restart(). The patch updates pnv_restart() to handle this cmd-arg
and issues opal_cec_reboot2 with OPAL_REBOOT_FULL_IPL to force a full
IPL reset.
