block: Allow unfreezing of a queue while requests are in progress

A later patch will call blk_freeze_queue_start() followed by
blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() without waiting for q_usage_counter to drop
to zero. Make sure that this doesn't cause a kernel warning to appear
by switching from percpu_ref_reinit() to percpu_ref_resurrect(). The
former namely requires that the refcount it operates on is zero.
