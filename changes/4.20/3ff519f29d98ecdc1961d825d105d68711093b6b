KVM: x86: adjust kvm_mmu_page member to save 8 bytes

On a 64bits machine, struct is naturally aligned with 8 bytes. Since
kvm_mmu_page member *unsync* and *role* are less then 4 bytes, we can
rearrange the sequence to compace the struct.

As the comment shows, *role* and *gfn* are used to key the shadow page. In
order to keep the comment valid, this patch moves the *unsync* up and
exchange the position of *role* and *gfn*.

From /proc/slabinfo, it shows the size of kvm_mmu_page is 8 bytes less and
with one more object per slap after applying this patch.

    # name            <active_objs> <num_objs> <objsize> <objperslab>
    kvm_mmu_page_header      0           0       168         24

    kvm_mmu_page_header      0           0       160         25
