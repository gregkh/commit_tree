HID: logitech: Enable high-resolution scrolling on Logitech mice

There are three features used by various Logitech mice for
high-resolution scrolling: the scrolling acceleration bit in HID++ 1.0,
and the x2120 and x2121 features in HID++ 2.0 and above. This patch
supports all three, and uses the multiplier reported by the mouse for
the HID++ 2.0+ features.

The full list of product IDs of mice which support high-resolution
scrolling was provided by Logitech, but the patch was tested using the
following mice (using the Unifying receiver):

* HID++ 1.0: Anywhere MX, Performance MX
* x2120: M560
* x2121: MX Anywhere 2, MX Master 2S
