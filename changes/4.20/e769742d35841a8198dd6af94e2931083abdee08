Revert "x86/jump-labels: Macrofy inline assembly code to work around GCC inlining bugs"

This reverts commit 5bdcd510c2ac9efaf55c4cbd8d46421d8e2320cd.

The macro based workarounds for GCC's inlining bugs caused regressions: distcc
and other distro build setups broke, and the fixes are not easy nor will they
solve regressions on already existing installations.

So we are reverting this patch and the 8 followup patches.

What makes this revert easier is that GCC9 will likely include the new 'asm inline'
syntax that makes inlining of assembly blocks a lot more robust.

This is a superior method to any macro based hackeries - and might even be
backported to GCC8, which would make all modern distros get the inlining
fixes as well.

Many thanks to Masahiro Yamada and others for helping sort out these problems.
