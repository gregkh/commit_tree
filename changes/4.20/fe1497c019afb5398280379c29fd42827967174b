MAINTAINERS: fix pattern in ARM/Synaptics berlin SoC section

Berlin SoC files has been moved from marvell dir to synaptics dir, but
commit bc52497a595d ("MAINTAINERS: update entry for ARM/berlin") didn't
update the dir accordingly. This patch fixes it.

From another side, new derivative SoCs from Synaptics may not be named
as berlin*, so let's update the entries accordingly.
