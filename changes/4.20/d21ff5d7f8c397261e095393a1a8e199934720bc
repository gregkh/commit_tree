Input: elantech - disable elan-i2c for P52 and P72

The current implementation of elan_i2c is known to not support those
2 laptops.

A proper fix is to tweak both elantech and elan_i2c to transmit the
correct information from PS/2, which would make a bad candidate for
stable.

So to give us some time for fixing the root of the problem, disable
elan_i2c for the devices we know are not behaving properly.
