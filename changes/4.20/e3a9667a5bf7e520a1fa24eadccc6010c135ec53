hv_netvsc: Fix rndis_per_packet_info internal field initialization

The RSC feature -- a bit field "internal" was added here with total
size unchanged:
struct rndis_per_packet_info {
	u32 size;
	u32 type:31;
	u32 internal:1;
	u32 ppi_offset;
};

On TX path, we put rndis msg into skb head room, which is not zeroed
before passing to us. We do not use the "internal" field in TX path,
but it may impact older hosts which use the entire 32 bits as "type".

To fix the bug, this patch sets the field "internal" to zero.
