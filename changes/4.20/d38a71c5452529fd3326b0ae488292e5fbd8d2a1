irqchip/gic-v3-its: Change initialization ordering for LPIs

We currently initialize the LPIs (and the ITS) fairly early, even
before the SMP support and the CPU interface. This is a bit odd
(as LPIs are not exactly crutial for the early boot process),
and is going to cause issues when reorganizing the probing code.

Let's move this initialization later.
