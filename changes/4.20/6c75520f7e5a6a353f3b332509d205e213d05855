IB/mlx5: Don't hold spin lock while checking device state

mdev->state device state is not protected by the QP for which WRs are
being processed. Therefore, there is no need to hold spin lock while
checking mdev state.

Given that device fatal error is unlikely situation, wrap the condition
check with unlikely().

Additionally, kernel QP1 is also a kernel ULP for which soft CQEs needs
to be generated. Therefore, check for device fatal error before
processing QP1 work requests.
