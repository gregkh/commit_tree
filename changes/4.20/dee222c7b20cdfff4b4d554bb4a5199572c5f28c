batman-adv: Move OGM rebroadcast stats to orig_ifinfo

B.A.T.M.A.N. IV requires the number of rebroadcast from a neighboring
originator. These statistics are gathered per interface which transmitted
the OGM (and then received it again). Since an originator is not interface
specific, a resizable array was used in each originator.

This resizable array had an entry for each interface and had to be resizes
(for all OGMs) when the number of active interface was modified. This could
cause problems when a large number of interface is added and not enough
continuous memory is available to allocate the array.

There is already a per interface originator structure "batadv_orig_ifinfo"
which can be used to store this information.
