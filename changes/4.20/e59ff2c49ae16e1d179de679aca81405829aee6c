virtio-net: disable guest csum during XDP set

We don't disable VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_CSUM if XDP was set. This means we
can receive partial csumed packets with metadata kept in the
vnet_hdr. This may have several side effects:

- It could be overridden by header adjustment, thus is might be not
  correct after XDP processing.
- There's no way to pass such metadata information through
  XDP_REDIRECT to another driver.
- XDP does not support checksum offload right now.

So simply disable guest csum if possible in this the case of XDP.
