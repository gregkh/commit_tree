selftests/net: add ip_defrag selftest

This test creates a raw IPv4 socket, fragments a largish UDP
datagram and sends the fragments out of order.

Then repeats in a loop with different message and fragment lengths.

Then does the same with overlapping fragments (with overlapping
fragments the expectation is that the recv times out).

Tested:

root@<host># time ./ip_defrag.sh
ipv4 defrag
PASS
ipv4 defrag with overlaps
PASS

real    1m7.679s
user    0m0.628s
sys     0m2.242s

A similar test for IPv6 is to follow.
