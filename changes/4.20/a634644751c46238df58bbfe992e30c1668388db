ocfs2: remove ocfs2_is_o2cb_active()

Remove ocfs2_is_o2cb_active().  We have similar functions to identify
which cluster stack is being used via osb->osb_cluster_stack.

Secondly, the current implementation of ocfs2_is_o2cb_active() is not
totally safe.  Based on the design of stackglue, we need to get
ocfs2_stack_lock before using ocfs2_stack related data structures, and
that active_stack pointer can be NULL in the case of mount failure.
