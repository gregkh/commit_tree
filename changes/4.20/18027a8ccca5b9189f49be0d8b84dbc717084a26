scsi: lpfc: reduce locking when updating statistics

Currently, on each io completion, the stats update routine indiscriminately
holds a lock. While holding the adapter-wide lock, checks are made to check
whether status are being tracked. When disabled (the default), the locking
wasted a lot of cycles.

Check for stats enablement before taking the lock.
