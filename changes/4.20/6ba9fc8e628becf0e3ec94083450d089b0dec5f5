btrfs: Ensure btrfs_trim_fs can trim the whole filesystem

[BUG]
fstrim on some btrfs only trims the unallocated space, not trimming any
space in existing block groups.

[CAUSE]
Before fstrim_range passed to btrfs_trim_fs(), it gets truncated to
range [0, super->total_bytes).  So later btrfs_trim_fs() will only be
able to trim block groups in range [0, super->total_bytes).

While for btrfs, any bytenr aligned to sectorsize is valid, since btrfs
uses its logical address space, there is nothing limiting the location
where we put block groups.

For filesystem with frequent balance, it's quite easy to relocate all
block groups and bytenr of block groups will start beyond
super->total_bytes.

In that case, btrfs will not trim existing block groups.

[FIX]
Just remove the truncation in btrfs_ioctl_fitrim(), so btrfs_trim_fs()
can get the unmodified range, which is normally set to [0, U64_MAX].
