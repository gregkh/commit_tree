perf scripts python: call-graph-from-sql.py: Refactor TreeItem class

class TreeItem represents items at all levels of the call-graph tree.
However, not all the levels represent the same data i.e. the top-level is
comms, the next level is threads, and subsequent levels are functions.
Consequently it is simpler to have separate classes for different levels
with commonality in a base class. Refactor TreeItem class accordingly.
