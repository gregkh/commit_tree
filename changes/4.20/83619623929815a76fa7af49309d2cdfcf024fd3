net/ipfrag: let ip[6]frag_high_thresh in ns be higher than in init_net

Currently, ip[6]frag_high_thresh sysctl values in new namespaces are
hard-limited to those of the root/init ns.

There are at least two use cases when it would be desirable to
set the high_thresh values higher in a child namespace vs the global hard
limit:

- a security/ddos protection policy may lower the thresholds in the
  root/init ns but allow for a special exception in a child namespace
- testing: a test running in a namespace may want to set these
  thresholds higher in its namespace than what is in the root/init ns

The new behavior:

 # ip netns add testns
 # ip netns exec testns bash

 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=9000000
 net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 9000000

 # sysctl net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh
 net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 9000000

 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=9000000
 net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 9000000

 # sysctl net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh
 net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 9000000

The old behavior:

 # ip netns add testns
 # ip netns exec testns bash

 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=9000000
 net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 9000000

 # sysctl net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh
 net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 4194304

 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=9000000
 net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 9000000

 # sysctl net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh
 net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 4194304
