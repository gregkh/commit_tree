KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add NO_HASH flag to GET_SMMU_INFO ioctl result

This adds a KVM_PPC_NO_HASH flag to the flags field of the
kvm_ppc_smmu_info struct, and arranges for it to be set when
running as a nested hypervisor, as an unambiguous indication
to userspace that HPT guests are not supported.  Reporting the
KVM_CAP_PPC_MMU_HASH_V3 capability as false could be taken as
indicating only that the new HPT features in ISA V3.0 are not
supported, leaving it ambiguous whether pre-V3.0 HPT features
are supported.
