bpf: bpftool, add support for attaching programs to maps

Sock map/hash introduce support for attaching programs to maps. To
date I have been doing this with custom tooling but this is less than
ideal as we shift to using bpftool as the single CLI for our BPF uses.
This patch adds new sub commands 'attach' and 'detach' to the 'prog'
command to attach programs to maps and then detach them.
