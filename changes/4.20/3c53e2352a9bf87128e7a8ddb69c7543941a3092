nvmem: hide unused nvmem_find_cell_by_index function

nvmem_find_cell_by_index() is only called from inside an #ifdef,
so we get a build warning without CONFIG_OF:

drivers/nvmem/core.c:496:1: error: 'nvmem_find_cell_by_index' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Move it into the same #ifdef as the caller to avoid the warning.
