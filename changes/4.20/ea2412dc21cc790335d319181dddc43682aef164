ACPI/IORT: Fix iort_get_platform_device_domain() uninitialized pointer value

Running the Clang static analyzer on IORT code detected the following
error:

Logic error: Branch condition evaluates to a garbage value

in

iort_get_platform_device_domain()

If the named component associated with a given device has no IORT
mappings, iort_get_platform_device_domain() exits its MSI mapping loop
with msi_parent pointer containing garbage, which can lead to erroneous
code path execution.

Initialize the msi_parent pointer, fixing the bug.

Fixes: d4f54a186667 ("ACPI: platform: setup MSI domain for ACPI based
platform device")
