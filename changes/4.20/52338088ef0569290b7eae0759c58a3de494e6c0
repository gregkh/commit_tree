arm64/numa: Unify common error path in numa_init()

At present numa_free_distance() is being called before numa_distance is
even initialized with numa_alloc_distance() which is really pointless.
Instead lets call numa_free_distance() on the common error path inside
numa_init() after numa_alloc_distance() has been successful.
