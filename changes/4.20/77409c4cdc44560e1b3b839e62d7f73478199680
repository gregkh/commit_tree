scsi: myrs: avoid stack overflow warning

Putting a 1024 byte data structure on the stack is generally a bad idea.
On 32-bit systems, it also triggers a compile-time warning when building
with -Og:

drivers/scsi/myrs.c: In function 'myrs_get_ctlr_info':
drivers/scsi/myrs.c:212:1: error: the frame size of 1028 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

We only really need three members of the structure, so just read them
manually here instead of copying the entire structure.
