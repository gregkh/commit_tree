x86-32, hibernate: Set up temporary text mapping for 32bit system

Set up the temporary text mapping for the final jump address
so that the system could jump to the right address after all
the pages have been copied back to their original address -
otherwise the final mapping for the jump address is invalid.

Analogous changes were made for 64-bit in commit 65c0554b73c9
(x86/power/64: Fix kernel text mapping corruption during image
restoration).
