kvm: arm/arm64: Prepare for VM specific stage2 translations

Right now the stage2 page table for a VM is hard coded, assuming
an IPA of 40bits. As we are about to add support for per VM IPA,
prepare the stage2 page table helpers to accept the kvm instance
to make the right decision for the VM. No functional changes.
Adds stage2_pgd_size(kvm) to replace S2_PGD_SIZE. Also, moves
some of the definitions in arm32 to align with the arm64.
Also drop the _AC() specifier constants wherever possible.
