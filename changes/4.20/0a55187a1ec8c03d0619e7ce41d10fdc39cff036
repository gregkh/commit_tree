USB: gadget core: Issue ->disconnect() callback from usb_gadget_disconnect()

The gadget documentation doesn't state clearly whether a gadget
driver's ->disconnect() callback should be invoked when the D+ pullup
is turned off.  Some UDC drivers do this and some don't.  This patch
settles the issue by making the core function usb_gadget_disconnect()
issue the callback, so that UDC drivers don't need to worry about it.

A description of the new behavior is added to the function's
kerneldoc.  Also, the patch removes a few superseded callbacks from
other core routines.

Future patches will remove the ->disconnect() calls from the UDC
drivers that make them, as they are now unnecessary.  Until all those
patches are merged gadget drivers may receive extra ->disconnect()
callbacks, but this should be harmless.
