x86/mm/cpa: Add sanity check for existing mappings

With the range check it is possible to do a quick verification that the
current mapping is correct vs. the static protection areas.

In case a incorrect mapping is detected a warning is emitted and the large
page is split up. If the large page is a 2M page, then the split code is
forced to check the static protections for the PTE entries to fix up the
incorrectness. For 1G pages this can't be done easily because that would
require to either find the offending 2M areas before the split or
afterwards. For now just warn about that case and revisit it when reported.
