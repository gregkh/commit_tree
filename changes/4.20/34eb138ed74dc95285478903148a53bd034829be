powerpc/mm: don't use _PAGE_EXEC for calling hash_preload()

The 'access' parameter of hash_preload() is either 0 or _PAGE_EXEC.
Among the two versions of hash_preload(), only the PPC64 one is
doing something with this 'access' parameter.

In order to remove the use of _PAGE_EXEC outside platform code,
'access' parameter is replaced by 'is_exec' which will be either
true of false, and the PPC64 version of hash_preload() creates
the access flag based on 'is_exec'.
