xfs: use offsetof() in place of offset macros for __xfsstats

Most offset macro mess is used in xfs_stats_format() only, and we can
simply get the right offsets using offsetof(), instead of several macros
to mark the offsets inside __xfsstats structure.

Replace all XFSSTAT_END_* macros by a single helper macro to get the
right offset into __xfsstats, and use this helper in xfs_stats_format()
directly.

The quota stats code, still looks a bit cleaner when using XFSSTAT_*
macros, so, this patch also defines XFSSTAT_START_XQMSTAT and
XFSSTAT_END_XQMSTAT locally to that code. This also should prevent
offset mistakes when updates are done into __xfsstats.
