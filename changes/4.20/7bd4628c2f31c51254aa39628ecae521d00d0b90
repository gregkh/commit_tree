mwifiex: do no submit URB in suspended state

There is a possible race between USB suspend and main thread:

1. After processing the command response, main thread will submit
rx_cmd URB back so as to process next command response, by
calling mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb.

2. During USB suspend, the suspend handler will check if rx_cmd
URB is pending(submitted) and if true, kill this URB.

There is a possible race between #1 and #2, where rx_cmd URB will
be submitted by main thread(#1) after the suspend handler check
in #2.

To fix this, check if device is already suspended in
mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb, in which case do not submit the URB.
