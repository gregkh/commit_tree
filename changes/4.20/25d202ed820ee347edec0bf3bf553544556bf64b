mount: Retest MNT_LOCKED in do_umount

It was recently pointed out that the one instance of testing MNT_LOCKED
outside of the namespace_sem is in ksys_umount.

Fix that by adding a test inside of do_umount with namespace_sem and
the mount_lock held.  As it helps to fail fails the existing test is
maintained with an additional comment pointing out that it may be racy
because the locks are not held.
