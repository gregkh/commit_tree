rcu: Remove for_each_rcu_flavor() flavor-traversal macro

Now that there is only ever a single flavor of RCU in a given kernel
build, there isn't a whole lot of point in having a flavor-traversal
macro.  This commit therefore removes it and converts calls to it to
straightline code, inlining trivial functions as appropriate.
