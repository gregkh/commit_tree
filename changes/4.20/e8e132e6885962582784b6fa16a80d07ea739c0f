powerpc/boot: Disable vector instructions

This will avoid auto-vectorisation when building with higher
optimisation levels.

We don't know if the machine can support VSX and even if it's present
it's probably not going to be enabled at this point in boot.

These flag were both added prior to GCC 4.6 which is the minimum
compiler version supported by upstream, thanks to Segher for the
details.
