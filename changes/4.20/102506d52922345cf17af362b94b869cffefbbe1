drm/i915/dp: Refactor max_vswing_tries variable

Changes the type and renames the max_vswing_tries variable
which was declared as an integer but used as a boolean
making it easy to be confused with a counter.

Changes in v2:
    - updated the title and commit message
    - left the loop exit point in place

v3: fix typo in title
v4: renamed max_vswing to max_vswing_reached (Ville)
