act_mirred: clear skb->tstamp on redirect

If sch_fq is used at ingress, skbs that might have been
timestamped by net_timestamp_set() if a packet capture
is requesting timestamps could be delayed by arbitrary
amount of time, since sch_fq time base is MONOTONIC.

Fix this problem by moving code from sch_netem.c to act_mirred.c.
