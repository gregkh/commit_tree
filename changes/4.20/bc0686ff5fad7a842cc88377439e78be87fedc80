drm/i915/gvt: support inconsecutive partial gtt entry write

Previously we assumed two 4-byte writes to the same PTE coming in sequence.
But recently we observed inconsecutive partial write happening as well. So
this patch enhances the previous solution. It now uses a list to save more
partial writes. If one partial write can be combined with another one in
the list to construct a full PTE, update its shadow entry. Otherwise, save
the partial write in the list.

v2: invalidate old entry and flush ggtt (Zhenyu)
v3: split old ggtt page unmap to another patch (Zhenyu)
v4: refine codes (Zhenyu)
