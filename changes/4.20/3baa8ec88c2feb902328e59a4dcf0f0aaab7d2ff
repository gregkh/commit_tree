mtd: devices: m25p80: Make sure WRITE_EN is issued before each write

Some SPI controllers can't write nor->page_size bytes in a single step
because their TX FIFO is too small, but when that happens we should
make sure a WRITE_EN command before each write access and READ_SR command
after each write access is issued.

The core is already taking care of that, so all we have to do here is
return the actual number of bytes that were written during the
spi_mem_exec_op() operation.
