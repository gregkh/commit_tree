mm/memory_hotplug.c: clean up node_states_check_changes_offline()

This patch, as the previous one, gets rid of the wrong if statements.
While at it, I realized that the comments are sometimes very confusing,
to say the least, and wrong.
For example:

___
zone_last = ZONE_MOVABLE;

/*
 * check whether node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY] will be changed
 * If we try to offline the last present @nr_pages from the node,
 * we can determind we will need to clear the node from
 * node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY].
 */

for (; zt <= zone_last; zt++)
        present_pages += pgdat->node_zones[zt].present_pages;
if (nr_pages >= present_pages)
        arg->status_change_nid = zone_to_nid(zone);
else
        arg->status_change_nid = -1;
___

In case the node gets empry, it must be removed from N_MEMORY.  We already
check N_HIGH_MEMORY a bit above within the CONFIG_HIGHMEM ifdef code.  Not
to say that status_change_nid is for N_MEMORY, and not for N_HIGH_MEMORY.

So I re-wrote some of the comments to what I think is better.
