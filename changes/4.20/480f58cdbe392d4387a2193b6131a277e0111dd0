arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: NanoPi-A64: Fix DCDC1 voltage

According to the NanoPi-A64 schematics, DCDC1 is connected to a voltage
rail named "VDD_SYS_3.3V". All users seem to expect 3.3V here: the
Ethernet PHY, the uSD card slot, the camera interface and the GPIO pins
on the headers.
Fix up the voltage on the regulator to lift it up to 3.3V.
