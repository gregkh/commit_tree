arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Orange Pi Win: Fix SD card node

The Orange Pi Win has a microSD card slot which is connected via all
four SD data lines. As the DT was not mentioning this fact, we got the
default single bit transfers, losing out on performance.
Also, as microSD does not have a write protect switch, we disable this
feature in the DT node.
