btrfs: add helper to obtain number of devices with ongoing dev-replace

When the replace is running the fs_devices::num_devices also includes
the replaced device, however in some operations like device delete and
balance it needs the actual num_devices without the repalced devices.
The function btrfs_num_devices() just provides that.

And here is a scenario how balance and repalce items could co-exist:

Consider balance is started and paused, now start the replace followed
by a unmount or system power-cycle. During following mount, the
open_ctree() first restarts the balance so it must check for the device
replace otherwise our num_devices calculation will be wrong.
