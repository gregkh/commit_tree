packet: add sockopt to ignore outgoing packets

Currently, the only way to ignore outgoing packets on a packet socket is
via the BPF filter.  With MSG_ZEROCOPY, packets that are looped into
AF_PACKET are copied in dev_queue_xmit_nit(), and this copy happens even
if the filter run from packet_rcv() would reject them.  So the presence
of a packet socket on the interface takes away the benefits of
MSG_ZEROCOPY, even if the packet socket is not interested in outgoing
packets.  (Even when MSG_ZEROCOPY is not used, the skb is unnecessarily
cloned, but the cost for that is much lower.)

Add a socket option to allow AF_PACKET sockets to ignore outgoing
packets to solve this.  Note that the *BSDs already have something
similar: BIOCSSEESENT/BIOCSDIRECTION and BIOCSDIRFILT.

The first intended user is lldpd.
