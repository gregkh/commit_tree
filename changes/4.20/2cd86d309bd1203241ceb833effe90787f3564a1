btrfs: qgroup: Don't trace subtree if we're dropping reloc tree

Reloc tree doesn't contribute to qgroup numbers, as we have accounted
them at balance time (see replace_path()).

Skipping the unneeded subtree tracing should reduce the overhead.

[[Benchmark]]
Hardware:
	VM 4G vRAM, 8 vCPUs,
	disk is using 'unsafe' cache mode,
	backing device is SAMSUNG 850 evo SSD.
	Host has 16G ram.

Mkfs parameter:
	--nodesize 4K (To bump up tree size)

Initial subvolume contents:
	4G data copied from /usr and /lib.
	(With enough regular small files)

Snapshots:
	16 snapshots of the original subvolume.
	each snapshot has 3 random files modified.

balance parameter:
	-m

So the content should be pretty similar to a real world root fs layout.
