iwlwifi: mvm: Send LQ command as async when necessary

The parameter that indicated whether the LQ command should be sent
as sync or async was removed, causing the LQ command to be sent as
sync from interrupt context (e.g. from the RX path). This resulted
in a kernel warning: "scheduling while atomic" and failing to send
the LQ command, which ultimately leads to a queue hang.

Fix it by adding back the required parameter to send the command as
sync only when it is allowed.
