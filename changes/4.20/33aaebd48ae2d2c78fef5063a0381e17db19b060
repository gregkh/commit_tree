ALSA: hda/realtek: ALC286 mic and headset-mode fixups for Acer Aspire U27-880

Acer Aspire U27-880(AIO) with ALC286 codec can not detect headset mic
and internal mic not working either. It needs the similar quirk like
Sony laptops to fix headphone jack sensing and enables use of the
internal microphone.

Unfortunately jack sensing for the headset mic is still not working.
