9p: clear dangling pointers in p9stat_free

p9stat_free is more of a cleanup function than a 'free' function as it
only frees the content of the struct; there are chances of use-after-free
if it is improperly used (e.g. p9stat_free called twice as it used to be
possible to)

Clearing dangling pointers makes the function idempotent and safer to use.
