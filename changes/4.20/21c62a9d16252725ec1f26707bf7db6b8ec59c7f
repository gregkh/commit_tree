drm/i915: Replace some PAGE_SHIFTs with I915_GTT_PAGE_SIZE

Clean up some cases where we're dealing with GTT pages instead of
system pages to use I915_GTT_PAGE_SIZE instead of PAGE_SHIT. So
just replace the the shifts with mul/div as appropriate. These
are the easy ones, the rest probably need some actual thought.

No real changes in the generated asm. Only gen8_ppgtt_insert_4lvl()
was affected as gcc decided to do the following change:
-     be9:       89 d9                   mov    %ebx,%ecx
-     beb:       c1 e1 0c                shl    $0xc,%ecx
-     bee:       48 63 c9                movslq %ecx,%rcx
+     be9:       48 63 cb                movslq %ebx,%rcx
+     bec:       48 c1 e1 0c             shl    $0xc,%rcx
and that then shifted a bunch of the offset by one byte. I presume
the sign extensions in the asm are due to integer promotions from
u16 etc. Hopefully someone has confirmed that those don't end up
doing the wrong thing for us.
