afs: Fix TTL on VL server and address lists

Currently the TTL on VL server and address lists isn't set in all
circumstances and may be set to poor choices in others, since the TTL is
derived from the SRV/AFSDB DNS record if and when available.

Fix the TTL by limiting the range to a minimum and maximum from the current
time.  At some point these can be made into sysctl knobs.  Further, use the
TTL we obtained from the upcall to set the expiry on negative results too;
in future a mechanism can be added to force reloading of such data.
