KVM: nVMX/nSVM: Fix bug which sets vcpu->arch.tsc_offset to L1 tsc_offset

Since commit e79f245ddec1 ("X86/KVM: Properly update 'tsc_offset' to
represent the running guest"), vcpu->arch.tsc_offset meaning was
changed to always reflect the tsc_offset value set on active VMCS.
Regardless if vCPU is currently running L1 or L2.

However, above mentioned commit failed to also change
kvm_vcpu_write_tsc_offset() to set vcpu->arch.tsc_offset correctly.
This is because vmx_write_tsc_offset() could set the tsc_offset value
in active VMCS to given offset parameter *plus vmcs12->tsc_offset*.
However, kvm_vcpu_write_tsc_offset() just sets vcpu->arch.tsc_offset
to given offset parameter. Without taking into account the possible
addition of vmcs12->tsc_offset. (Same is true for SVM case).

Fix this issue by changing kvm_x86_ops->write_tsc_offset() to return
actually set tsc_offset in active VMCS and modify
kvm_vcpu_write_tsc_offset() to set returned value in
vcpu->arch.tsc_offset.
In addition, rename write_tsc_offset() callback to write_l1_tsc_offset()
to make it clear that it is meant to set L1 TSC offset.
