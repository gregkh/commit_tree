scsi/ufs: qcom: Remove ufs_qcom_phy_*() calls from host

The host makes direct calls into phy using ufs_qcom_phy_*()
APIs. These APIs are only defined for 20nm qcom-ufs-qmp phy
which is not being used by any architecture as yet. Future
architectures too are not going to use 20nm ufs phy.
So remove these ufs_qcom_phy_*() calls from host to let further
change declare the 20nm phy as broken.
Also remove couple of stale enum defines for ufs phy.
