drm/amdgpu: Fix compute ring 1.0.0 failure after reset

Problem: After GPU reset on dGPUs with gfx8 compute ring
1.0.0 fails to pass the ring test. Ring registers inspection
shows that it's active and no hang is observed (rptr == wptr)
No significant diffs were observed between CP_HQD* registers
for the ring in good and bad shape.

Fix: No clear reason why but reversing the order of ring tests
fixes the problem.
