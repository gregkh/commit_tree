net: hns3: bugfix for hclge_mdio_write and hclge_mdio_read

When there is a PHY, the driver needs to complete some operations through
MDIO during reset reinitialization, so HCLGE_STATE_CMD_DISABLE is more
suitable than HCLGE_STATE_RST_HANDLING to prevent the MDIO operation from
being sent during the hardware reset.
