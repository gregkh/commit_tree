ACPI/PPTT: Handle architecturally unknown cache types

The type of a cache might not be specified by architectural mechanisms (ie
system registers), but its type might be specified in the PPTT.  In this
case, we should populate the type of the cache, rather than leave it
undefined.

This fixes the issue where the cacheinfo driver will not populate sysfs
for such caches, resulting in the information missing from utilities like
lstopo and lscpu, thus degrading the user experience.
