drm/i915: Nuke struct_mutex from context_setparam

Userspace should be free to race against itself and shoot itself in
the foot if it so desires to adjust a parameter at the same time as
submitting a batch to that context. As such, the struct_mutex in context
setparam is only being used to serialise userspace against itself and
not for any protection of internal structs and so is superfluous.

v2: Separate user_flags from internal flags to reduce chance of
interference; and use locked bit ops for user updates.
