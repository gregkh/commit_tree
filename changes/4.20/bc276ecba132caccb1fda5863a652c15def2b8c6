powerpc/64s/hash: Do not use PPC_INVALIDATE_ERAT on CPUs before POWER9

PPC_INVALIDATE_ERAT is slbia IH=7 which is a new variant introduced
with POWER9, and the result is undefined on earlier CPUs.

Commits 7b9f71f974 ("powerpc/64s: POWER9 machine check handler") and
d4748276ae ("powerpc/64s: Improve local TLB flush for boot and MCE on
POWER9") caused POWER7/8 code to use this instruction. Remove it. An
ERAT flush can be made by invalidatig the SLB, but before POWER9 that
requires a flush and rebolt.
