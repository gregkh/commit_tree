userfaultfd: selftest: generalize read and poll

We do very similar things in read and poll modes, but we're copying the
codes around.  Share the codes properly on reading the message and
handling the page fault to make the code cleaner.  Meanwhile this solves
previous mismatch of behaviors between the two modes on that the old code:

- did not check EAGAIN case in read() mode
- ignored BOUNCE_VERIFY check in read() mode
