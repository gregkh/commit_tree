ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size

In a former commit, PCM constraint based on LCM of SYT_INTERVAL was
obsoleted with PCM rule. However, the new PCM rule brings -EINVAL in
some cases that max/min values of size of buffer/period is not
multiples of one of values of SYT_INTERVAL. For example, pulseaudio
always fail to configure PCM substream.

This commit changes strategy for the PCM rule. Although the buggy rules
had a single dependency (rate from period, period from rate, rate from
buffer, buffer from rate), a revised rule has double dependencies
(period from period/rate, buffer from buffer/rate). A step of value is
calculated with table of SYT_INTERVAL and list of available rates. This
prevents interval template which brings -EINVAL to a call of
snd_interval_refine().
