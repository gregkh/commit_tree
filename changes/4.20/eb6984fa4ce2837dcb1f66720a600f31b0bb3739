ext4: missing !bh check in ext4_xattr_inode_write()

According to Ted Ts'o ext4_getblk() called in ext4_xattr_inode_write()
should not return bh = NULL

The only time that bh could be NULL, then, would be in the case of
something really going wrong; a programming error elsewhere (perhaps a
wild pointer dereference) or I/O error causing on-disk file system
corruption (although that would be highly unlikely given that we had
*just* allocated the blocks and so the metadata blocks in question
probably would still be in the cache).
