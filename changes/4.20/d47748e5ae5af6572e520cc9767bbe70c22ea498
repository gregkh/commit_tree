ovl: automatically enable redirect_dir on metacopy=on

Current behavior is to automatically disable metacopy if redirect_dir is
not enabled and proceed with the mount.

If "metacopy=on" mount option was given, then this behavior can confuse the
user: no mount failure, yet metacopy is disabled.

This patch makes metacopy=on imply redirect_dir=on.

The converse is also true: turning off full redirect with redirect_dir=
{off|follow|nofollow} will disable metacopy.

If both metacopy=on and redirect_dir={off|follow|nofollow} is specified,
then mount will fail, since there's no way to correctly resolve the
conflict.
