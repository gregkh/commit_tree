HID: asus: fix build warning wiht CONFIG_ASUS_WMI disabled

asus_wmi_evaluate_method() is an empty dummy function when CONFIG_ASUS_WMI
is disabled, or not reachable from a built-in device driver. This leads to
a theoretical evaluation of an uninitialized variable that the compiler
complains about, failing to check that the hardcoded return value makes
this an unreachable code path:

                 from include/linux/kernel.h:14,
                 from include/linux/list.h:9,
                 from include/linux/dmi.h:5,
                 from drivers/hid/hid-asus.c:29:
drivers/hid/hid-asus.c: In function 'asus_input_configured':

   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/hid/hid-asus.c:359:6: note: 'value' was declared here
  u32 value;
      ^~~~~

With an extra IS_ENABLED() check, the warning goes away.
