rcu: Remove rsp parameter from rcu_node tree accessor macros

There now is only one rcu_state structure in a given build of the Linux
kernel, so there is no need to pass it as a parameter to RCU's rcu_node
tree's accessor macros.  This commit therefore removes the rsp parameter
from those macros in kernel/rcu/rcu.h, and removes some now-unused rsp
local variables while in the area.
