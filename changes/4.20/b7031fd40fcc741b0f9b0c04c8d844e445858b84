KVM: nVMX: reset cache/shadows when switching loaded VMCS

Reset the vm_{entry,exit}_controls_shadow variables as well as the
segment cache after loading a new VMCS in vmx_switch_vmcs().  The
shadows/cache track VMCS data, i.e. they're stale every time we
switch to a new VMCS regardless of reason.

This fixes a bug where stale control shadows would be consumed after
a nested VMExit due to a failed consistency check.
