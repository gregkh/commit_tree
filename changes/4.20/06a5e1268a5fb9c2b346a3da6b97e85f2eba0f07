mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() do not crash on Compound

collapse_shmem()'s VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PageTransCompound) was unsafe: before
it holds page lock of the first page, racing truncation then extension
might conceivably have inserted a hugepage there already.  Fail with the
SCAN_PAGE_COMPOUND result, instead of crashing (CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y) or
otherwise mishandling the unexpected hugepage - though later we might
code up a more constructive way of handling it, with SCAN_SUCCESS.
