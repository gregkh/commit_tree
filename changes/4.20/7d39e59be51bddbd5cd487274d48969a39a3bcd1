drm/omap: dsi: Fixup video mode in .set_config() operation

The DSI encoder modifies the passed videomode to take the requirements
of the internal DISPC-DSI bus into account in the .enable_video_output()
operation. This should be performed in the .check_timings() operation
instead. There is however no .check_timings() operation as the DSI
encoder uses a custom API, so move it to the closest match which is the
.set_config() operation.
