coresight: Add support for CLAIM tag protocol

Coresight architecture defines CLAIM tags for a device to negotiate
control of the components (external agent vs self-hosted). Each device
has a pair of registers (CLAIMSET & CLAIMCLR) for managing the CLAIM
tags. However, the protocol for the CLAIM tags is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.
PSCI has recommendations for the use of the CLAIM tags to negotiate
controls for external agent vs self-hosted use. This patch implements
the recommended protocol by PSCI.

The claim/disclaim operations are performed from the device specific
drivers. The disadvantage is that the calls are sprinkled in each driver,
but this makes the operation much simpler.
