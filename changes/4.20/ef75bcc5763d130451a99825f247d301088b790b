hfs: fix BUG on bnode parent update

hfs_brec_update_parent() may hit BUG_ON() if the first record of both a
leaf node and its parent are changed, and if this forces the parent to
be split.  It is not possible for this to happen on a valid hfs
filesystem because the index nodes have fixed length keys.

For reasons I ignore, the hfs module does have support for a number of
hfsplus features.  A corrupt btree header may report variable length
keys and trigger this BUG, so it's better to fix it.
