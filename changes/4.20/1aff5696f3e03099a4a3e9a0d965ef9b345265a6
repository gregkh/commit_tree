xfs: always assign buffer verifiers when one is provided

If a caller supplies buffer ops when trying to read a buffer and the
buffer doesn't already have buf ops assigned, ensure that the ops are
assigned to the buffer and the verifier is run on that buffer.

Note that current XFS code is careful to assign buffer ops after a
xfs_{trans_,}buf_read call in which ops were not supplied.  However, we
should apply ops defensively in case there is ever a coding mistake; and
an upcoming repair patch will need to be able to read a buffer without
assigning buf ops.
