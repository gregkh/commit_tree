NFSv4: Fix a NFSv4 state manager deadlock

Fix a deadlock whereby the NFSv4 state manager can get stuck in the
delegation return code, waiting for a layout return to complete in
another thread. If the server reboots before that other thread
completes, then we need to be able to start a second state
manager thread in order to perform recovery.
