kvm: x86: Add exception payload fields to kvm_vcpu_events

The per-VM capability KVM_CAP_EXCEPTION_PAYLOAD (to be introduced in a
later commit) adds the following fields to struct kvm_vcpu_events:
exception_has_payload, exception_payload, and exception.pending.

With this capability set, all of the details of vcpu->arch.exception,
including the payload for a pending exception, are reported to
userspace in response to KVM_GET_VCPU_EVENTS.

With this capability clear, the original ABI is preserved, and the
exception.injected field is set for either pending or injected
exceptions.

When userspace calls KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS with
KVM_CAP_EXCEPTION_PAYLOAD clear, exception.injected is no longer
translated to exception.pending. KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS can now only
establish a pending exception when KVM_CAP_EXCEPTION_PAYLOAD is set.
