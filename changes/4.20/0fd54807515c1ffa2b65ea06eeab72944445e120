dpaa_eth: Remove useless declaration

Clang warns:

drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa/dpaa_eth.c:2734:34: warning:
tentative array definition assumed to have one element
static const struct of_device_id dpaa_match[];
                                 ^
1 warning generated.

Turns out that since this driver was introduced in commit 9ad1a3749333
("dpaa_eth: add support for DPAA Ethernet"), this declaration has been
unused. Remove it to silence the warning.
