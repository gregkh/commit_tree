Btrfs: preftree: use rb_first_cached

rb_first_cached() trades an extra pointer "leftmost" for doing the same
job as rb_first() but in O(1).

While resolving indirect refs and missing refs, it always looks for the
first rb entry in a while loop, it's helpful to use rb_first_cached
instead.

For more details about the optimization see patch "Btrfs: delayed-refs:
use rb_first_cached for href_root".
