smb3: Fix rmdir compounding regression to strict servers

Some servers require that the setinfo matches the exact size,
and in this case compounding changes introduced by
commit c2e0fe3f5aae ("cifs: make rmdir() use compounding")
caused us to send 8 bytes (padded length) instead of 1 byte
(the size of the structure).  See MS-FSCC section 2.4.11.

Fixing this when we send a SET_INFO command for delete file
disposition, then ends up as an iov of a single byte but this
causes problems with SMB3 and encryption.

To avoid this, instead of creating a one byte iov for the disposition value
and then appending an additional iov with a 7 byte padding we now handle
this as a single 8 byte iov containing both the disposition byte as well as
the padding in one single buffer.
