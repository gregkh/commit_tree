ASoC: wm_adsp: Fix dma-unsafe read of scratch registers

Stack memory isn't DMA-safe so it isn't safe to use either
regmap_raw_read or regmap_bulk_read to read into stack memory.

The two functions to read the scratch registers were using
stack memory and regmap_raw_read. It's not worth allocating
memory just for this trivial read, and it isn't time-critical.
A simple regmap_read for each register is sufficient.
