ACPI/ADXL: Add address translation interface using an ACPI DSM

Some new Intel servers provide an interface so that the OS can ask the
BIOS to translate a system physical address to a memory address (socket,
memory controller, channel, rank, dimm, etc.). This is useful for EDAC
drivers that want to take the address of an error reported in a machine
check bank and let the user know which DIMM may need to be replaced.

Specification for this interface is available at:

 [ Based on earlier code by Qiuxu Zhuo <qiuxu.zhuo@intel.com>. ]

 [ bp: Make the first pr_info() in adxl_init() pr_debug() so that it
   doesn't pollute every dmesg. ]
