ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker output regression on Thinkpad T570

We've got a regression report for some Thinkpad models (at least
T570s) which shows the too low speaker output volume.  The bisection
leaded to the commit 61fcf8ece9b6 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Enable Thinkpad
Dock device for ALC298 platform"), and it's basically adding the two
pin configurations for the dock, and looks harmless.

The real culprit seems, though, that the DAC assignment for the
speaker pin is implicitly assumed on these devices, i.e. pin NID 0x14
to be coupled with DAC NID 0x03.  When more pins are configured by the
commit above, the auto-parser changes the DAC assignment, and this
resulted in the regression.

As a workaround, just provide the fixed pin / DAC mapping table for
this Thinkpad fixup function.  It's no generic solution, but the
problem itself is pretty much device-specific, so must be good
enough.
