sdhci: acpi: add qcom sdhci host reset quirk fix

After host requests RESET_FOR_ALL action, the hardware output an
interrupt for OS and waiting for the OS to approve.

Before writing this fix, ACPI GED has handled the interrupt. But
the ACPI GED belongs to a slow process, and sometimes the handling
process time is more than 100ms(Mutex wait more than 100ms). So
drop the GED solution and add this quirk fix.
