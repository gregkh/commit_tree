mm/swapfile.c: call free_swap_slot() in __swap_entry_free()

This is a code cleanup patch without functionality change.

Originally, when __swap_entry_free() is called, and its return value is 0,
free_swap_slot() will always be called to free the swap entry to the
per-CPU pool.  So move the call to free_swap_slot() to __swap_entry_free()
to simplify the code.
