afs: Fix callback handling

In some circumstances, the callback interest pointer is NULL, so in such a
case we can't dereference it when checking to see if the callback is
broken.  This causes an oops in some circumstances.

Fix this by replacing the function that worked out the aggregate break
counter with one that actually does the comparison, and then make that
return true (ie. broken) if there is no callback interest as yet (ie. the
pointer is NULL).
