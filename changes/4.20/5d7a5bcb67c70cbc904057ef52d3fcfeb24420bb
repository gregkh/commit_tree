sunrpc: correct the computation for page_ptr when truncating

When truncating the encode buffer, the page_ptr is getting
advanced, causing the next page to be skipped while encoding.
The page is still included in the response, so the response
contains a page of bogus data.

We need to adjust the page_ptr backwards to ensure we encode
the next page into the correct place.

We saw this triggered when concurrent directory modifications caused
nfsd4_encode_direct_fattr() to return nfserr_noent, and the resulting
call to xdr_truncate_encode() corrupted the READDIR reply.
