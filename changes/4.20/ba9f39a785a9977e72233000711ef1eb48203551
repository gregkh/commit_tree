mmc: core: Allow BKOPS and CACHE ctrl even if no HPI support

In commit 5320226a0512 ("mmc: core: Disable HPI for certain Hynix eMMC
cards"), then intent was to prevent HPI from being used for some eMMC
cards, which didn't properly support it. However, that went too far, as
even BKOPS and CACHE ctrl became prevented. Let's restore those parts and
allow BKOPS and CACHE ctrl even if HPI isn't supported.
