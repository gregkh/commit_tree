Revert "mm, thp: consolidate THP gfp handling into alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask"

This reverts commit 89c83fb539f95491be80cdd5158e6f0ce329e317.

This should have been done as part of 2f0799a0ffc0 ("mm, thp: restore
node-local hugepage allocations").  The movement of the thp allocation
policy from alloc_pages_vma() to alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask() was
intended to only set __GFP_THISNODE for mempolicies that are not
MPOL_BIND whereas the revert could set this regardless of mempolicy.

While the check for MPOL_BIND between alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask()
and alloc_pages_vma() was racy, that has since been removed since the
revert.  What is left is the possibility to use __GFP_THISNODE in
policy_node() when it is unexpected because the special handling for
hugepages in alloc_pages_vma()  was removed as part of the consolidation.

Secondly, prior to 89c83fb539f9, alloc_pages_vma() implemented a somewhat
different policy for hugepage allocations, which were allocated through
alloc_hugepage_vma().  For hugepage allocations, if the allocating
process's node is in the set of allowed nodes, allocate with
__GFP_THISNODE for that node (for MPOL_PREFERRED, use that node with
__GFP_THISNODE instead).  This was changed for shmem_alloc_hugepage() to
allow fallback to other nodes in 89c83fb539f9 as it did for new_page() in
mm/mempolicy.c which is functionally different behavior and removes the
requirement to only allocate hugepages locally.

So this commit does a full revert of 89c83fb539f9 instead of the partial
revert that was done in 2f0799a0ffc0.  The result is the same thp
allocation policy for 4.20 that was in 4.19.
