arm64: dts: marvell: armada-cp110: change the PPv2 IRQ names

This patch changes the PPv2 IRQ names in the CP110 device tree to match
a corresponding change in the Marvell PPv2 driver. The reason this was
updated is the IRQ where names after Tx/Rx interrupts, but this is not
true and can be configured. A following patch will add more of them and
the names wouldn't make sense.
