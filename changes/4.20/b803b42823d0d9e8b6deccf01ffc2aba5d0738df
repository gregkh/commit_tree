xarray: Add XArray iterators

The xa_for_each iterator allows the user to efficiently walk a range
of the array, executing the loop body once for each entry in that
range that matches the filter.  This commit also includes xa_find()
and xa_find_after() which are helper functions for xa_for_each() but
may also be useful in their own right.

In the xas family of functions, we have xas_for_each(), xas_find(),
xas_next_entry(), xas_for_each_tagged(), xas_find_tagged(),
xas_next_tagged() and xas_pause().
