KVM: nVMX: split pieces of prepare_vmcs02() to prepare_vmcs02_early()

Add prepare_vmcs02_early() and move pieces of prepare_vmcs02() to the
new function.  prepare_vmcs02_early() writes the bits of vmcs02 that
a) must be in place to pass the VMFail consistency checks (assuming
vmcs12 is valid) and b) are needed recover from a VMExit, e.g. host
state that is loaded on VMExit.  Splitting the functionality will
enable KVM to leverage hardware to do VMFail consistency checks via
a dry run of VMEnter and recover from a potential VMExit without
having to fully initialize vmcs02.

Add prepare_vmcs02_constant_state() to handle writing vmcs02 state that
comes from vmcs01 and never changes, i.e. we don't need to rewrite any
of the vmcs02 that is effectively constant once defined.
