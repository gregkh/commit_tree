Compiler Attributes: remove unneeded sparse (__CHECKER__) tests

Sparse knows about a few more attributes now, so we can remove
the __CHECKER__ conditions from them (which, in turn, allow us
to move some of them later on to compiler_attributes.h).

  * assume_aligned: since sparse's commit ffc860b ("sparse:
    ignore __assume_aligned__ attribute"), included in 0.5.1

  * error: since sparse's commit 0a04210 ("sparse: Add 'error'
    to ignored attributes"), included in 0.5.0

  * hotpatch: since sparse's commit 6043210 ("sparse/parse.c:
    ignore hotpatch attribute"), included in 0.5.1

  * warning: since sparse's commit 977365d ("Avoid "attribute
    'warning': unknown attribute" warning"), included in 0.4.2

On top of that, __must_be_array does not need it either because:

  * Even ancient versions of sparse do not have a problem

  * BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO() is currently disabled for __CHECKER__
