arm64: dts: meson: Fix erroneous SPI bus warnings

dtc has new checks for SPI buses. The meson dts files have a node named
spi' which causes false positive warnings. As the node is a pinctrl child
node, change the node name to be 'spi-pins' to fix the warnings.

arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic/meson-gxbb-nanopi-k2.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /soc/periphs@c8834000/pinctrl@4b0/spi: incorrect #address-cells for SPI bus
