lightnvm: pblk: refactor metadata paths

pblk maintains two different metadata paths for smeta and emeta, which
store metadata at the start of the line and at the end of the line,
respectively. Until now, these path has been common for writing and
retrieving metadata, however, as these paths diverge, the common code
becomes less clear and unnecessary complicated.

In preparation for further changes to the metadata write path, this
patch separates the write and read paths for smeta and emeta and
removes the synchronous emeta path as it not used anymore (emeta is
scheduled asynchronously to prevent jittering due to internal I/Os).
