xfs: extent shifting doesn't fully invalidate page cache

The extent shifting code uses a flush and invalidate mechainsm prior
to shifting extents around. This is similar to what
xfs_free_file_space() does, but it doesn't take into account things
like page cache vs block size differences, and it will fail if there
is a page that it currently busy.

xfs_flush_unmap_range() handles all of these cases, so just convert
xfs_prepare_shift() to us that mechanism rather than having it's own
special sauce.
