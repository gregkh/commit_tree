drm/amdgpu: Fix skipping hangged job reset during gpu recover.

Problem:
During GPU recover DAL would hang in
amdgpu_pm_compute_clocks->amdgpu_fence_wait_empty

Fix:
Turns out there was a typo introduced by
3320b8d drm/amdgpu: remove job->ring which caused skipping
amdgpu_fence_driver_force_completion and so the hangged job
was never force signaled and this would cause the hang later in DAL.
