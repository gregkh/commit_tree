IB/rxe: avoid back-to-back retries

Error retries can occur due to timeouts, NAKs or receiving
packets beyond the current read request. Avoid back-to-back
retries due to packet processing, by only retrying the initial
attempt immediately. Subsequent retries must be due to timeouts.

Continue to process completion packets after scheduling a retry.
