rcu: Remove rsp parameter from rcu_boot_init_percpu_data() and friends

There now is only one rcu_state structure in a given build of
the Linux kernel, so there is no need to pass it as a parameter
to RCU's functions.  This commit therefore removes the rsp
parameter from rcu_boot_init_percpu_data(), rcu_init_percpu_data(),
rcu_cleanup_dying_idle_cpu(), and rcu_migrate_callbacks().  While in
the neighborhood, line the last three into rcutree_prepare_cpu(),
rcu_report_dead() and rcutree_migrate_callbacks(), respectively.
This also gets rid of the for_each_rcu_flavor() calls that were in
those tree functions.
