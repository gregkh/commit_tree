x86/cpu: Create Hygon Dhyana architecture support file

Add x86 architecture support for a new processor: Hygon Dhyana Family
18h. Carve out initialization code needed by Dhyana into a separate
compilation unit.

To identify Hygon Dhyana CPU, add a new vendor type X86_VENDOR_HYGON.

Since Dhyana uses AMD functionality to a large degree, select
CPU_SUP_AMD which provides that functionality.

 [ bp: drop explicit license statement as it has an SPDX tag already. ]
