s390/kasan: free early identity mapping structures

Kasan initialization code is changed to populate persistent shadow
first, save allocator position into pgalloc_freeable and proceed with
early identity mapping creation. This way early identity mapping paging
structures could be freed at once after switching to swapper_pg_dir
when early identity mapping is not needed anymore.
