sched/rt: Update comment in pick_next_task_rt()

Commit:

  f4ebcbc0d7e0 ("sched/rt: Substract number of tasks of throttled queues from rq->nr_running")

added a new rt_rq->rt_queued field, which is used to indicate the status of
rq->rt enqueue or dequeue. So, the ->rt_nr_running check was removed and we
now check ->rt_queued instead.

Fix the comment in pick_next_task_rt() as well, which was still referencing
the old logic.
