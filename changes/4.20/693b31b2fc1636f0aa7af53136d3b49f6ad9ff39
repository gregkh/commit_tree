powerpc/selftests: Wait all threads to join

Test tm-tmspr might exit before all threads stop executing, because it just
waits for the very last thread to join before proceeding/exiting.

This patch makes sure that all threads that were created will join before
proceeding/exiting.

This patch also guarantees that the amount of threads being created is equal
to thread_num.
