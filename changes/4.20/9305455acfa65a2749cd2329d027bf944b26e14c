block: Finish renaming REQ_DISCARD into REQ_OP_DISCARD

Some time ago REQ_DISCARD was renamed into REQ_OP_DISCARD. Some comments
and documentation files were not updated however. Update these comments
and documentation files. See also commit 4e1b2d52a80d ("block, fs,
drivers: remove REQ_OP compat defs and related code").
