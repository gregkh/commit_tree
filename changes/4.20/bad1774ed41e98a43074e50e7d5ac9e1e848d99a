media: ov5640: Fix timings setup code

As of: commit 476dec012f4c ("media: ov5640: Add horizontal and vertical
totals") the timings parameters gets programmed separately from the
static register values array.

When changing capture mode, the vertical and horizontal totals gets
inspected by the set_mode_exposure_calc() functions, and only later
programmed with the new values. This means exposure, light banding
filter and shutter gain are calculated using the previous timings, and
are thus not correct.

Fix this by programming timings right after the static register value
table has been sent to the sensor in the ov5640_load_regs() function.
