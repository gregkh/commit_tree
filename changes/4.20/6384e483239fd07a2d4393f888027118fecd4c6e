net: phy: trigger state machine immediately in phy_start_machine

When starting the state machine there may be work to be done
immediately, e.g. if the initial state is PHY_UP then the state
machine may trigger an autonegotiation. Having said that I see no need
to wait a second until the state machine is run first time.
