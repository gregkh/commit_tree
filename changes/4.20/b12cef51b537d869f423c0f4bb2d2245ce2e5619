dpaa2-eth: Fix Kconfig dependencies

Both ARCH_LAYERSCAPE and COMPILE_TEST dependencies are already implied
through the FSL_MC_BUS dep, so there's no need to state it explicitly.

Also, the fsl-mc bus depends on COMPILE_TEST only for some
architectures (arm, arm64, ppc, x86), so it's not correct to
claim build support unconditionally.
