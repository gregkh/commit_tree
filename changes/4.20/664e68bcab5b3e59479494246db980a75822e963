scsi: ufs: fix integer type usage in uapi header

We get a warning from 'make headers_check' about a newly introduced usage
of integer types in the scsi/scsi_bsg_ufs.h uapi header:

usr/include/scsi/scsi_bsg_ufs.h:18: found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without #include <linux/types.h>

Aside from the missing linux/types.h inclusion, I also noticed that it
uses the wrong types: 'u32' is not available at all in user space, and
'uint32_t' depends on the inclusion of a standard header that we should
not include from kernel headers.

Change the all to __u32 and similar types here.

I also note the usage of '__be32' and '__be16' that seems unfortunate for
a user space API. I wonder if it would be better to define the interface
in terms of a CPU-endian structure and convert it in kernel space.
