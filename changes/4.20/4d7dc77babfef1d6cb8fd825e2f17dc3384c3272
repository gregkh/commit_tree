clk: qcom: Add support for Krait clocks

The Krait clocks are made up of a series of muxes and a divider
that choose between a fixed rate clock and dedicated HFPLLs for
each CPU. Instead of using mmio accesses to remux parents, the
Krait implementation exposes the remux control via cp15
registers. Support these clocks.
