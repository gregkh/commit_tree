y2038: sched: Change sched_rr_get_interval to use __kernel_timespec

This is a preparation patch for converting sys_sched_rr_get_interval to
work with 64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures. The 'interval' argument
is changed to struct __kernel_timespec, which will be redefined using
64-bit time_t in the future. The compat version of the system call in
turn is enabled for compilation with CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME so
the individual 32-bit architectures can share the handling of the
traditional argument with 64-bit architectures providing it for their
compat mode.
