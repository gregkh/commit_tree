selftests/bpf: fix return value comparison for tests in test_libbpf.sh

The return value for each test in test_libbpf.sh is compared with

    if (( $? == 0 )) ; then ...

This works well with bash, but not with dash, that /bin/sh is aliased to
on some systems (such as Ubuntu).

Let's replace this comparison by something that works on both shells.
