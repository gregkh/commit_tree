mm/gup: cache dev_pagemap while pinning pages

Getting pages from ZONE_DEVICE memory needs to check the backing device's
live-ness, which is tracked in the device's dev_pagemap metadata.  This
metadata is stored in a radix tree and looking it up adds measurable
software overhead.

This patch avoids repeating this relatively costly operation when
dev_pagemap is used by caching the last dev_pagemap while getting user
pages.  The gup_benchmark kernel self test reports this reduces time to
get user pages to as low as 1/3 of the previous time.
