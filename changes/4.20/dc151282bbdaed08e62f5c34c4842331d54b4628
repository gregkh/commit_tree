net: vhost: factor out busy polling logic to vhost_net_busy_poll()

Factor out generic busy polling logic and will be
used for in tx path in the next patch. And with the patch,
qemu can set differently the busyloop_timeout for rx queue.

To avoid duplicate codes, introduce the helper functions:
* sock_has_rx_data(changed from sk_has_rx_data)
* vhost_net_busy_poll_try_queue
