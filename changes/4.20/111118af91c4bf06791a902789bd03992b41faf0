staging:rtl8192u: Refactor BaseBand_Config_Type - Style

Rename the type to baseband_config_type to clear the checkpatch issue
with CamelCase naming. Remove the 'typedef' directive to clear the
issue with defining new types.

As it is only used in the file r819xU_phy.c the type has been moved
to the r819xU_phy.h file.

The enumerated type is only used as a parameter to the function
rtl8192_phyConfigBB. Previously that parameter used type 'u8' so no
compiler typechecking was being performed. The parameter type has been
corrected.

These changes are coding style changes and as such should have no
impact on runtime code execution.
