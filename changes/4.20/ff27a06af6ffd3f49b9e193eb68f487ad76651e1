perf top: Start display thread earlier

If events are coming in at a rate such that the event processing thread
can barely keep up, our initial run of the event ring will almost never
terminate and this delays the starting of the display thread.

The screen basically stays black until the event thread can get out of
it's endless loop.

Therefore, start the display thread before we start processing the ring
buffer.

This also make sure that we always have the user requested real time
setting engaged when processing the ring.
