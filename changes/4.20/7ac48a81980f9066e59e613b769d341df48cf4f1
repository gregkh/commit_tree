dt-bindings: arm: alpine: Move CPU control related binding to cpu-enable-method/al,alpine-smp

It is best practice to have 1 binding per file, so board level bindings
should be separate for various misc SoC bindings. Move the Alpine CPU
control to al,alpine-smp and we can also remove a cross reference.
