bnxt_en: Keep track of reserved IRQs.

The new 57500 chips use 1 NQ per MSIX vector, whereas legacy chips use
1 CP ring per MSIX vector.  To better unify this, add a resv_irqs
field to struct bnxt_hw_resc.  On legacy chips, we initialize resv_irqs
with resv_cp_rings.  On new chips, we initialize it with the allocated
MSIX resources.
