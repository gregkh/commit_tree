dma-mapping: consolidate the dma mmap implementations

The only functional differences (modulo a few missing fixes in the arch
code) is that architectures without coherent caches need a hook to
convert a virtual or dma address into a pfn, given that we don't have
the kernel linear mapping available for the otherwise easy virt_to_page
call.  As a side effect we can support mmap of the per-device coherent
area even on architectures not providing the callback, and we make
previous dangerous default methods dma_common_mmap actually save for
non-coherent architectures by rejecting it without the right helper.

In addition to that we need a hook so that some architectures can
override the protection bits when mmaping a dma coherent allocations.
