dt-bindings: usb: fusb302: Use usb-connector bindings for configuration

There are now generic usb-connector bindings which can be used
to define a port controllers configuration for USB-PD, so device
specific bindings are no longer necessary.

This update deprecates 'fcs,operating-sink-microwatt', and references
the 'usb-connector' bindings instead to achieve the required port
config.
