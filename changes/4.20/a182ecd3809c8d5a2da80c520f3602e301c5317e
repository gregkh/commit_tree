ASoC: intel: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Add quirk for boards using pmc_plt_clk_0

Some boards such as the Swanky model Chromebooks use pmc_plt_clk_0 for the
mclk instead of pmc_plt_clk_3.

This commit adds a DMI based quirk for this.

This fixing audio no longer working on these devices after
commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as CLK_IS_CRITICAL")
that commit fixes us unnecessary keeping unused clocks on, but in case
of the Swanky that was breaking audio support since we were not using
the right clock in the cht_bsw_max98090_ti machine driver.
