OPP: Use a single mechanism to free the OPP table

Currently there are two separate ways to free the OPP table based on how
it is created in the first place.

We call _dev_pm_opp_remove_table() to free the static and/or dynamic
OPP, OPP list devices, etc. This is done for the case where the OPP
table is added while initializing the OPPs, like via the path
dev_pm_opp_of_add_table().

We also call dev_pm_opp_put_opp_table() in some cases which eventually
frees the OPP table structure once the reference count reaches 0. This
is used by the first case as well as other cases like
dev_pm_opp_set_regulators() where the OPPs aren't necessarily
initialized at this point.

This whole thing is a bit unclear and messy and obstruct any further
cleanup/fixup of OPP core.

This patch tries to streamline this by keeping a single path for OPP
table destruction, i.e. dev_pm_opp_put_opp_table().

All the cleanup happens in _opp_table_kref_release() now after the
reference count reaches 0. _dev_pm_opp_remove_table() is removed as it
isn't required anymore.

We don't drop the reference to the OPP table after creating it from
_of_add_opp_table_v{1|2}() anymore and the same is dropped only when we
try to remove them.
