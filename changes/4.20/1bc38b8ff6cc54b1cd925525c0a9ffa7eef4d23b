libbpf: relicense libbpf as LGPL-2.1 OR BSD-2-Clause

libbpf is maturing as a library and gaining features that no other bpf libraries support
(BPF Type Format, bpf to bpf calls, etc)
Many Apache2 licensed projects (like bcc, bpftrace, gobpf, cilium, etc)
would like to use libbpf, but cannot do this yet, since Apache Foundation explicitly
states that LGPL is incompatible with Apache2.
Hence let's relicense libbpf as dual license LGPL-2.1 or BSD-2-Clause,
since BSD-2 is compatible with Apache2.
Dual LGPL or Apache2 is invalid combination.
Fix license mistake in Makefile as well.
