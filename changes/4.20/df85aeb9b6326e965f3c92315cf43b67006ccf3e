dpaa2-eth: Use new API for Rx flow hashing

The Management Complex (MC) firmware initially allowed the
configuration of a single key to be used both for Rx flow hashing
and flow classification. This prevented us from supporting
Rx flow classification through ethtool.

Starting with version 10.7.0, the Management Complex(MC) offers
a new set of APIs for separate configuration of Rx hashing and
classification keys.

Update the Rx flow hashing support to use the new API, if available.
