coresight: Fix remote endpoint parsing

When parsing the remote endpoint of an output port, we do :
     rport = of_graph_get_remote_port(ep);
     rparent = of_graph_get_remote_port_parent(ep);

and then parse the "remote_port" as if it was the remote endpoint,
which is wrong. The code worked fine because we used endpoint number
as the port number. Let us fix it and optimise a bit as:

     remote_ep = of_graph_get_remote_endpoint(ep);
     if (remote_ep)
        remote_parent = of_graph_get_port_parent(remote_ep);

and then, parse the remote_ep for the port/endpoint details.
