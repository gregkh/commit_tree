perf tools: Do not zero sample_id_all for group members

Andi reported following malfunction:

  # perf record -e '{ref-cycles,cycles}:S' -a sleep 1
  # perf script
  non matching sample_id_all

That's because we disable sample_id_all bit for non-sampling group
members. We can't do that, because it needs to be the same over the
whole event list. This patch keeps it untouched again.
