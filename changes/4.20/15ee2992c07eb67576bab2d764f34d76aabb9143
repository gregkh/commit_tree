Input: cyapa - mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in this particular case, I replaced the "Fallthrough state"
commern with a proper "Fall through", which is what GCC is expecting to
find.
