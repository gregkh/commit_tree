ARM: orion: avoid VLA in orion_mpp_conf

Testing randconfig builds found an instance of a VLA that was
missed when determining that we have removed them all:

arch/arm/plat-orion/mpp.c: In function 'orion_mpp_conf':
arch/arm/plat-orion/mpp.c:31:2: error: ISO C90 forbids variable length array 'mpp_ctrl' [-Werror=vla]

This one is fairly straightforward: we know what all three
callers are, and the maximum length is not very long.
