bnxt_en: Fix RSS context allocation.

Recent commit has added the reservation of RSS context.  This requires
bnxt_hwrm_vnic_qcaps() to be called before allocating any RSS contexts.
The bnxt_hwrm_vnic_qcaps() call sets up proper flags that will
determine how many RSS contexts to allocate to support NTUPLE.

This causes a regression that too many RSS contexts are being reserved
and causing resource shortage when enabling many VFs.  Fix it by calling
bnxt_hwrm_vnic_qcaps() earlier.
