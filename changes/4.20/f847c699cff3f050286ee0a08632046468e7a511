f2fs: allow out-place-update for direct IO in LFS mode

Normally, DIO uses in-pllace-update, but in LFS mode, f2fs doesn't
allow triggering any in-place-update writes, so we fallback direct
write to buffered write, result in bad performance of large size
write.

This patch adds to support triggering out-place-update for direct IO
to enhance its performance.

Note that it needs to exclude direct read IO during direct write,
since new data writing to new block address will no be valid until
write finished.
