block: remove bio_rewind_iter()

It is pointed that bio_rewind_iter() is one very bad API[1]:

1) bio size may not be restored after rewinding

2) it causes some bogus change, such as 5151842b9d8732 (block: reset
bi_iter.bi_done after splitting bio)

3) rewinding really makes things complicated wrt. bio splitting

4) unnecessary updating of .bi_done in fast path

So this patch takes Kent's suggestion to restore one bio into its original
state via saving bio iterator(struct bvec_iter) in bio_integrity_prep(),
given now bio_rewind_iter() is only used by bio integrity code.
