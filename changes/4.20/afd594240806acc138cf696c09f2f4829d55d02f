bpf: fix off-by-one error in adjust_subprog_starts

When patching in a new sequence for the first insn of a subprog, the start
 of that subprog does not change (it's the first insn of the sequence), so
 adjust_subprog_starts should check start <= off (rather than < off).
Also added a test to test_verifier.c (it's essentially the syz reproducer).
