kdb: use correct pointer when 'btc' calls 'btt'

On a powerpc 8xx, 'btc' fails as follows:

Entering kdb (current=0x(ptrval), pid 282) due to Keyboard Entry
kdb> btc
btc: cpu status: Currently on cpu 0
Available cpus: 0
kdb_getarea: Bad address 0x0

when booting the kernel with 'debug_boot_weak_hash', it fails as well

Entering kdb (current=0xba99ad80, pid 284) due to Keyboard Entry
kdb> btc
btc: cpu status: Currently on cpu 0
Available cpus: 0
kdb_getarea: Bad address 0xba99ad80

On other platforms, Oopses have been observed too, see
https://github.com/linuxppc/linux/issues/139

This is due to btc calling 'btt' with %p pointer as an argument.

This patch replaces %p by %px to get the real pointer value as
expected by 'btt'
