rtnetlink: Update rtnl_dump_ifinfo for strict data checking

Update rtnl_dump_ifinfo for strict data checking. If the flag is set,
the dump request is expected to have an ifinfomsg struct as the header
potentially followed by one or more attributes. Any data passed in the
header or as an attribute is taken as a request to influence the data
returned. Only values supported by the dump handler are allowed to be
non-0 or set in the request. At the moment only the IFA_TARGET_NETNSID,
IFLA_EXT_MASK, IFLA_MASTER, and IFLA_LINKINFO attributes are supported.

Existing code does not fail the dump if nlmsg_parse fails. That behavior
is kept for non-strict checking.
