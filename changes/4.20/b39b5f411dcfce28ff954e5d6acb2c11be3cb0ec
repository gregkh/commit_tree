bpf: add cg_skb_is_valid_access for BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB

BPF programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB need to access headers in the
skb. This patch enables direct access of skb for these programs.

Two helper functions bpf_compute_and_save_data_end() and
bpf_restore_data_end() are introduced. There are used in
__cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb(), to compute proper data_end for the
BPF program, and restore original data afterwards.
