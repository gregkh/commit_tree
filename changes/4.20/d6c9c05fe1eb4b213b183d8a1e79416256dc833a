perf cs-etm: Correct CPU mode for samples

Since commit edeb0c90df35 ("perf tools: Stop fallbacking to kallsyms for
vdso symbols lookup"), the kernel address cannot be properly parsed to
kernel symbol with command 'perf script -k vmlinux'.  The reason is
CoreSight samples is always to set CPU mode as PERF_RECORD_MISC_USER,
thus it fails to find corresponding map/dso in below flows:

  process_sample_event()
    `-> machine__resolve()
	  `-> thread__find_map(thread, sample->cpumode, sample->ip, al);

In this flow it needs to pass argument 'sample->cpumode' to tell what's
the CPU mode, before it always passed PERF_RECORD_MISC_USER but without
any failure until the commit edeb0c90df35 ("perf tools: Stop fallbacking
to kallsyms for vdso symbols lookup") has been merged.  The reason is
even with the wrong CPU mode the function thread__find_map() firstly
fails to find map but it will rollback to find kernel map for vdso
symbols lookup.  In the latest code it has removed the fallback code,
thus if CPU mode is PERF_RECORD_MISC_USER then it cannot find map
anymore with kernel address.

This patch is to correct samples CPU mode setting, it creates a new
helper function cs_etm__cpu_mode() to tell what's the CPU mode based on
the address with the info from machine structure; this patch has a bit
extension to check not only kernel and user mode, but also check for
host/guest and hypervisor mode.  Finally this patch uses the function in
instruction and branch samples and also apply in cs_etm__mem_access()
for a minor polishing.
