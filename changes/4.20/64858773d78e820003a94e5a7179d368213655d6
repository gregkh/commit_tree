ARM: dts: exynos: Fix sound in Snow-rev5 Chromebook

This patch adds missing properties to the CODEC and sound nodes, so the
audio will work also on Snow rev5 Chromebook. This patch is an extension
to the commit e9eefc3f8ce0 ("ARM: dts: exynos: Add missing clock and
DAI properties to the max98095 node in Snow Chromebook")
and commit 6ab569936d60 ("ARM: dts: exynos: Enable HDMI audio on Snow
Chromebook").  It has been reported that such changes work fine on the
rev5 board too.
