page cache: Convert filemap_map_pages to XArray

Slight change of strategy here; if we have trouble getting hold of a
page for whatever reason (eg a compound page is split underneath us),
don't spin to stabilise the page, just continue the iteration, like we
would if we failed to trylock the page.  Since this is a speculative
optimisation, it feels like we should allow the process to take an extra
fault if it turns out to need this page instead of spending time to pin
down a page it may not need.
