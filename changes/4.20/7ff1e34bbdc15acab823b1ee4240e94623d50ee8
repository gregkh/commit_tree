um: Give start_idle_thread() a return code

Fixes:
arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:613:1: warning: control reaches end of
non-void function [-Wreturn-type]

longjmp() never returns but gcc still warns that the end of the function
can be reached.
Add a return code and debug aid to detect this impossible case.
