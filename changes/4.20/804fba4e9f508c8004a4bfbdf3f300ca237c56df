bnxt_en: Fix CNP CoS queue regression.

Recent changes to support the 57500 devices have created this
regression.  The bnxt_hwrm_queue_qportcfg() call was moved to be
called earlier before the RDMA support was determined, causing
the CoS queues configuration to be set before knowing whether RDMA
was supported or not.  Fix it by moving it to the right place right
after RDMA support is determined.
