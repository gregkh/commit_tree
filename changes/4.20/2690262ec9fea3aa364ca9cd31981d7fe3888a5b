drm/amdgpu: Relocate some definitions v2

Move some KFD-related (but used in amdgpu_drv.c) definitions from
kfd_priv.h to kgd_kfd_interface.h so we don't need to include kfd_priv.h
in amdgpu_drv.c. This fixes a build failure when AMDGPU is enabled but
MMU_NOTIFIER is not.
This patch also disables KFD-related module options when HSA_AMD is not
enabled.

v2: rebase (Alex)
