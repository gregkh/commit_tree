fanotify: simplify handling of FAN_ONDIR

fanotify mark add/remove code jumps through hoops to avoid setting the
FS_ISDIR in the commulative object mask.

That was just papering over a bug in fsnotify() handling of the FS_ISDIR
extra flag. This bug is now fixed, so all the hoops can be removed along
with the unneeded internal flag FAN_MARK_ONDIR.
