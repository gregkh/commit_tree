fuse: add readdir cache version

Allow the cache to be invalidated when page(s) have gone missing.  In this
case increment the version of the cache and reset to an empty state.

Add a version number to the directory stream in struct fuse_file as well,
indicating the version of the cache it's supposed to be reading.  If the
cache version doesn't match the stream's version, then reset the stream to
the beginning of the cache.
