staging:rtl8192u: Removed commented out structure - Style

Two unions HT_CAPABILITY and HT_CAPABILITY_MACPARA have previously been
commented out of code. Since they are obviously not used in code and
the commented out unions add nothing to the code they have been removed.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
