ALSA: hda: Use new non-cached allocation for non-snoop mode

Now the ALSA memory allocator helper supports the new non-cached
pages, let's use the new type, SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC_SG, for HD-audio
driver.  This allows us to reduce lots of codes.

As another positive side-effect by this patch, the long-standing issue
with non-snoop mode playing in the non-mmap mode is fixed.  The core
memalloc helper does the proper pgprot setup for non-cached pages for
vmap(), which was missing in the past.
