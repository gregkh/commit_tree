nvmem: add support for cell info

Add new structs and routines allowing users to define nvmem cells from
machine code. This global list of entries is parsed when a provider
is registered and cells are associated with the relevant nvmem_device
struct.

A possible improvement for the future is to allow users to register
cell tables after the nvmem provider has been registered by updating
the cell list at each call to nvmem_(add|del)_cell_table().
