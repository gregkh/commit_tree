KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Clear partition table entry on vm teardown

When destroying a VM we return the LPID to the pool, however we never
zero the partition table entry. This is instead done when we reallocate
the LPID.

Zero the partition table entry on VM teardown before returning the LPID
to the pool. This means if we were running as a nested hypervisor the
real hypervisor could use this to determine when it can free resources.
