SUNRPC: Simplify dealing with aborted partially transmitted messages

If the previous message was only partially transmitted, we need to close
the socket in order to avoid corruption of the message stream. To do so,
we currently hijack the unlocking of the socket in order to schedule
the close.
Now that we track the message offset in the socket state, we can move
that kind of checking out of the socket lock code, which is needed to
allow messages to remain queued after dropping the socket lock.
