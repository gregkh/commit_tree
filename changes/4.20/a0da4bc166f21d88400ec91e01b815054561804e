powerpc/mm: Allow platforms to redefine some helpers

The 40xx defines _PAGE_HWWRITE while others don't.
The 8xx defines _PAGE_RO instead of _PAGE_RW.
The 8xx defines _PAGE_PRIVILEGED instead of _PAGE_USER.
The 8xx defines _PAGE_HUGE and _PAGE_NA while others don't.

Lets those platforms redefine pte_write(), pte_wrprotect() and
pte_mkwrite() and get _PAGE_RO and _PAGE_HWWRITE off the common
helpers.

Lets the 8xx redefine pte_user(), pte_mkprivileged() and pte_mkuser()
and get rid of _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and _PAGE_USER default values.

Lets the 8xx redefine pte_mkhuge() and get rid of
_PAGE_HUGE default value.
