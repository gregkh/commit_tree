powerpc/eeh: Cleanup unnecessary eeh_pe_state_mark_with_cfg()

The function eeh_pe_state_mark_with_cfg() just performs the work of
eeh_pe_state_mark() and then, conditionally, the work of
eeh_pe_state_clear(). However it is only ever called with a constant
state such that the condition is always true, so replace it by direct
calls.
