rcu: Stop testing RCU-bh and RCU-sched

Now that the RCU-bh and RCU-sched update-side functions are simple
wrappers around their RCU counterparts, there isn't a whole lot of
point in testing them.  This commit therefore removes the self-test
capability and removes the corresponding kernel-boot parameters.
It also updates the various rcutorture .boot files to remove the
kernel boot parameters that call for testing RCU-bh and RCU-sched.
