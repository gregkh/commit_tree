gpio: ep93xx: Switch A and B to use GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP

We can quite easily switch banks/ports A and B to use
GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP which is code that will be more careful
about handling interrupt descriptors and use a proper
irqdomain for translating the IRQs. This cuts down some
code in favor of using the implementation inside
gpiolib.
