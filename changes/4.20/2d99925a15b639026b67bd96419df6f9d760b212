hwmon: (nct6775) Separate fan/pwm configuration detection for NCT6793D

While detecting the configuration for multiple chips in one go reduces
code size, it also increases code complexity. Separate chip detection
to improve code readability. As first step, separate detection for
NCT6793D.

No functional change.
