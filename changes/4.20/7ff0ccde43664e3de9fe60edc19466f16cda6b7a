nfp: bpf: support pointers to other stack frames for BPF-to-BPF calls

Mark instructions that use pointers to areas in the stack outside of the
current stack frame, and process them accordingly in mem_op_stack().
This way, we also support BPF-to-BPF calls where the caller passes a
pointer to data in its own stack frame to the callee (typically, when
the caller passes an address to one of its local variables located in
the stack, as an argument).

Thanks to Jakub and Jiong for figuring out how to deal with this case,
I just had to turn their email discussion into this patch.
