mlxsw: spectrum_router: Allow querying VR ID based on table ID

In the device, different VRFs (routing tables) are represented using
different virtual routers (VRs) and thus the kernel's table IDs are
mapped to VR IDs.

Allow internal users of the IP router to query the VR ID based on a
kernel table ID.

This is needed - for example - when configuring the underlay VR where
VxLAN encapsulated packets will undergo an L3 lookup. In this case, the
kernel's table ID is derived from the VxLAN device's configuration.
