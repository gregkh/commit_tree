NFSv4: Don't exit the state manager without clearing NFS4CLNT_MANAGER_RUNNING

If we exit the NFSv4 state manager due to a umount, then we can end up
leaving the NFS4CLNT_MANAGER_RUNNING flag set. If another mount causes
the nfs4_client to be rereferenced before it is destroyed, then we end
up never being able to recover state.
