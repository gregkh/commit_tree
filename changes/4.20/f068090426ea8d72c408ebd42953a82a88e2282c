xhci: Fix leaking USB3 shared_hcd at xhci removal

Ensure that the shared_hcd pointer is valid when calling usb_put_hcd()

The shared_hcd is removed and freed in xhci by first calling
usb_remove_hcd(xhci->shared_hcd), and later
usb_put_hcd(xhci->shared_hcd)

Afer commit fe190ed0d602 ("xhci: Do not halt the host until both HCD have
disconnected their devices.") the shared_hcd was never properly put as
xhci->shared_hcd was set to NULL before usb_put_hcd(xhci->shared_hcd) was
called.

shared_hcd (USB3) is removed before primary hcd (USB2).
While removing the primary hcd we might need to handle xhci interrupts
to cleanly remove last USB2 devices, therefore we need to set
xhci->shared_hcd to NULL before removing the primary hcd to let xhci
interrupt handler know shared_hcd is no longer available.

xhci-plat.c, xhci-histb.c and xhci-mtk first create both their hcd's before
adding them. so to keep the correct reverse removal order use a temporary
shared_hcd variable for them.
For more details see commit 4ac53087d6d4 ("usb: xhci: plat: Create both
HCDs before adding them")
