scsi: lpfc: fix block guard enablement on SLI3 adapters

Since f44ac12f1dcc, BG enablement is tracked with the LPFC_SLI3_BG_ENABLED
bit, which is set in lpfc_get_cfgparam before lpfc_sli_config_sli_port() is
called. The bit shouldn't be cleared before checking the feature.  Based on
problem analysis by David Bond.
