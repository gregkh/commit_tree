arch/sh/include/asm/io.h: provide prototypes for PCI I/O mapping in asm/io.h

Most architectures provide prototypes for the PCI I/O mapping operations
when asm/io.h is included but SH doesn't currently do that, leading to
for example warnings in sound/pci/hda/patch_ca0132.c when pci_iomap() is
used on current -next.  Make SH more consistent with other architectures
by including asm-generic/pci_iomap.h in asm/io.h.
