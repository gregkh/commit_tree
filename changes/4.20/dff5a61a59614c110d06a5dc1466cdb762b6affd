KEYS: asym_tpm: Implement pkey_query [ver #2]

This commit implements the pkey_query operation.  This is accomplished
by utilizing the public key portion to obtain max encryption size
information for the operations that utilize the public key (encrypt,
verify).  The private key size extracted from the TPM_Key data structure
is used to fill the information where the private key is used (decrypt,
sign).

The kernel uses a DER/BER format for public keys and does not support
setting the key via the raw binary form.  To get around this a simple
DER/BER formatter is implemented which stores the DER/BER formatted key
and exponent in a temporary buffer for use by the crypto API.

The only exponent supported currently is 65537.  This holds true for
other Linux TPM tools such as 'create_tpm_key' and
trousers-openssl_tpm_engine.
