vfs: vfs_dedupe_file_range() doesn't return EOPNOTSUPP

It returns EINVAL when the operation is not supported by the
filesystem. Fix it to return EOPNOTSUPP to be consistent with
the man page and clone_file_range().

Clean up the inconsistent error return handling while I'm there.
(I know, lipstick on a pig, but every little bit helps...)
