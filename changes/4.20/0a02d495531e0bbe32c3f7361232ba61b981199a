drm/omap: populate DSI platform bus earlier

After the changes from 4.20 the DSI encoder tries to find the
attached panel before populating the DSI bus. If the panel is
not found -EPROBE_DEFER is returned, so the DSI bus is never
populated and the panel never added.

Fix this by populating the DSI bus before searching for the
video sink in dsi_init_output().
