drbd: Convert from ahash to shash

In preparing to remove all stack VLA usage from the kernel[1], this
removes the discouraged use of AHASH_REQUEST_ON_STACK in favor of
the smaller SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK by converting from ahash-wrapped-shash
to direct shash. By removing a layer of indirection this both improves
performance and reduces stack usage. The stack allocation will be made
a fixed size in a later patch to the crypto subsystem.

The bulk of the lines in this change are simple s/ahash/shash/, but the
main logic differences are in drbd_csum_ee() and drbd_csum_bio(), which
externalizes the page walking with k(un)map_atomic() instead of using
scattergather.
