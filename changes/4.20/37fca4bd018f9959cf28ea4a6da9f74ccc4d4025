hexagon: remove the sync_single_for_cpu DMA operation

hexagon does all the required cache maintainance at dma map time, and none
at unmap time.  It thus has to implement sync_single_for_device to match
the map cace for buffer reuse, but there is no point in doing another
invalidation in the sync_single_cpu_case, which in terms of cache
maintainance is equivalent to the unmap case.
