cifs: allow calling SMB2_xxx_free(NULL)

Change these free functions to allow passing NULL as the argument and
treat it as a no-op just like free(NULL) would.
Or, if rqst->rq_iov is NULL.

The second scenario could happen for smb2_queryfs() if the call
to SMB2_query_info_init() fails and we go to qfs_exit to clean up
and free all resources.
In that case we have not yet assigned rqst[2].rq_iov and thus
the rq_iov dereference in SMB2_close_free() will cause a NULL pointer
dereference.
