lightnvm: combine 1.2 and 2.0 command flags

Add nvm_set_flags helper to enable core to appropriately
set the command flags for read/write/erase depending on which version
a drive supports.

The flags arguments can be distilled into the access hint,
scrambling, and program/erase suspend. Replace the access hint with
a "is_seq" parameter. The rest of the flags are dependent on the
command opcode, which is trivial to detect and set.
