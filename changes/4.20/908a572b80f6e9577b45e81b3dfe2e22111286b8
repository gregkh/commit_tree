fuse: fix blocked_waitq wakeup

Using waitqueue_active() is racy.  Make sure we issue a wake_up()
unconditionally after storing into fc->blocked.  After that it's okay to
optimize with waitqueue_active() since the first wake up provides the
necessary barrier for all waiters, not the just the woken one.
