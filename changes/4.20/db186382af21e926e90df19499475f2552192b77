scsi: qla2xxx: Fix NVMe Target discovery

This patch fixes issue when remoteport registers itself as both FCP and
FC-NVMe with the switch, driver will pick FC-NVMe personality as default when
scanning for targets.

Driver was using comaprative operator instead of bitwise operator to check for
fc4_type for both FCP and FC-NVME.
