arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Reserve gpio ranges on MTP

GPIOs 0 through 3 and 81 through 84 are configured to not be accessible
from the application CPUs. Mark them as reserved to allow the MSM8998
MTP to boot after the introduction of 3edfb7bd76bd ("gpiolib: Show
correct direction from the beginning").
