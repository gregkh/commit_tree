staging:rtl8192u: Rename member pDot11dInfo - Style

Rename 'pDot11dInfo', this member variable of the structure
ieee80211_device causes a checkpatch issue, CamelCase naming. The
member has been renamed 'dot11d_info' to clear this issue.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
