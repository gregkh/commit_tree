lightnvm: pblk: encapsulate rb pointer operations

pblk's read/write buffer is always a power-of-2, thus wrapping up the
buffer can be done with a bit mask. Since this is an implementation
detail internal to the write buffer, make a helper that hides pointer
increment + wrap, and allows to transparently relax this assumption in
the future.
