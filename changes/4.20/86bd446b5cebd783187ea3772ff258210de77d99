net: sched: rename qdisc_destroy() to qdisc_put()

Current implementation of qdisc_destroy() decrements Qdisc reference
counter and only actually destroy Qdisc if reference counter value reached
zero. Rename qdisc_destroy() to qdisc_put() in order for it to better
describe the way in which this function currently implemented and used.

Extract code that deallocates Qdisc into new private qdisc_destroy()
function. It is intended to be shared between regular qdisc_put() and its
unlocked version that is introduced in next patch in this series.
