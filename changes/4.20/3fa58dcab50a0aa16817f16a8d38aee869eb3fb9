acpi, nfit: Fix ARS overflow continuation

When the platform BIOS is unable to report all the media error records
it requires the OS to restart the scrub at a prescribed location. The
driver detects the overflow condition, but then fails to report it to
the ARS state machine after reaping the records. Propagate -ENOSPC
correctly to continue the ARS operation.
