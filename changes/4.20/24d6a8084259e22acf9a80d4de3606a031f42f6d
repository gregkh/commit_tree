libbpf: Consistent prefixes for interfaces in str_error.h.

libbpf is used more and more outside kernel tree. That means the library
should follow good practices in library design and implementation to
play well with third party code that uses it.

One of such practices is to have a common prefix (or a few) for every
interface, function or data structure, library provides. I helps to
avoid name conflicts with other libraries and keeps API consistent.

Inconsistent names in libbpf already cause problems in real life. E.g.
an application can't use both libbpf and libnl due to conflicting
symbols.

Having common prefix will help to fix current and avoid future problems.

libbpf already uses the following prefixes for its interfaces:
* bpf_ for bpf system call wrappers, program/map/elf-object
  abstractions and a few other things;
* btf_ for BTF related API;
* libbpf_ for everything else.

The patch renames function in str_error.h to have libbpf_ prefix since it
misses one and doesn't fit well into the first two categories.
