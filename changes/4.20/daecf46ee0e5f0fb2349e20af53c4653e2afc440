ASoC: soc-core: use snd_soc_dai_link_component for platform

Current struct snd_soc_dai_link is supporting multicodec,
and it is supporting legacy style of
	codec_name
	codec_of_node
	code_dai_name
This is handled as single entry of multicodec.

We don't have multicpu support yet, but in the future we will.
In such case, we can use snd_soc_dai_link_component for both
cpu/codec. Then the code will be more simple and readble.

As next step, we want to use it for platform, too.
This patch adds snd_soc_dai_link_component style for platform.
We might have multiplatform support in the future, but we
don't know yet. To avoid un-known issue / complex code,
this patch supports just single-platform as 1st step.

If we could use snd_soc_dai_link_component for all CPU/Codec/Platform,
we will switch to new style, and remove legacy code.
This is prepare for it.
