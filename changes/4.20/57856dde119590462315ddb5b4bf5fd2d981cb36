octeontx2-af: Support for disabling NPA Aura/Pool contexts

This patch adds support for a RVU PF/VF to disable all Aura/Pool
contexts of a NPA LF via mbox. This will be used by PF/VF drivers
upon teardown or while freeing up HW resources.

A HW context which is not INIT'ed cannot be modified and a
RVU PF/VF driver may or may not INIT all the Aura/Pool contexts.
So a bitmap is introduced to keep track of enabled NPA Aura/Pool
contexts, so that only enabled hw contexts are disabled upon LF
teardown.
