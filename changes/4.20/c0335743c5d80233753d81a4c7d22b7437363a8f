rcutorture: Test extended "rcu" read-side critical sections

This commit makes the "rcu" torture type test extended read-side
critical sections in order to test the deferral of RCU-preempt
quiescent-state testing.

In CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernels, this simply duplicates the setup already
in place for the "sched" torture type.
