KVM: x86: fix empty-body warnings

We get the following warnings about empty statements when building
with 'W=1':

arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c:632:53: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c:1907:42: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c:1936:65: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c:1975:44: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]

Rework the debug helper macro to get rid of these warnings.
