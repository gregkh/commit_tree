IB/mlx5: Fix page fault handling for MW

Memory windows are implemented with an indirect MKey, when a page fault
event comes for a MW Mkey we need to find the MR at the end of the list of
the indirect MKeys by iterating on all items from the first to the last.

The offset calculated during this process has to be zeroed after the first
iteration or the next iteration will start from a wrong address, resulting
incorrect ODP faulting behavior.
