tools lib traceevent, perf tools: Move struct tep_handler definition in a local header file

As traceevent is going to be transferred into a proper library,
its local data should be protected from the library users.
This patch encapsulates struct tep_handler into a local header,
not visible outside of the library. It implements also a bunch
of new APIs, which library users can use to access tep_handler members.
