x86/mm: Clarify hardware vs. software "error_code"

We pass around a variable called "error_code" all around the page
fault code.  Sounds simple enough, especially since "error_code" looks
like it exactly matches the values that the hardware gives us on the
stack to report the page fault error code (PFEC in SDM parlance).

But, that's not how it works.

For part of the page fault handler, "error_code" does exactly match
PFEC.  But, during later parts, it diverges and starts to mean
something a bit different.

Give it two names for its two jobs.

The place it diverges is also really screwy.  It's only in a spot
where the hardware tells us we have kernel-mode access that occurred
while we were in usermode accessing user-controlled address space.
Add a warning in there.
