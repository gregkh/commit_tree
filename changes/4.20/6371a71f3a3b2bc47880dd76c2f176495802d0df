net/ipv6: Add support for dumping addresses for a specific device

If an RTM_GETADDR dump request has ifa_index set in the ifaddrmsg
header, then return only the addresses for that device.

Since inet6_dump_addr is reused for multicast and anycast addresses,
this adds support for device specfic dumps of RTM_GETMULTICAST and
RTM_GETANYCAST as well.
