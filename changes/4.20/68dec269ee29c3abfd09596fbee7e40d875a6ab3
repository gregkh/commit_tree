MIPS: memset: Limit excessive `noreorder' assembly mode use

Rewrite to use the `reorder' assembly mode and remove manually scheduled
delay slots except where GAS cannot schedule a delay-slot instruction
due to a data dependency or a section switch (as is the case with the EX
macro).  No change in machine code produced.
