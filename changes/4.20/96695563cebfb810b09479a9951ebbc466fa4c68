powerpc/tm: Fix HTM documentation

This patch simply fix part of the documentation on the HTM code.

This fixes reference to old fields that were renamed in commit
000ec280e3dd ("powerpc: tm: Rename transct_(*) to ck(\1)_state")

It also documents better the flow after commit eb5c3f1c8647 ("powerpc:
Always save/restore checkpointed regs during treclaim/trecheckpoint"),
where tm_recheckpoint can recheckpoint what is in ck{fp,vr}_state
blindly.
