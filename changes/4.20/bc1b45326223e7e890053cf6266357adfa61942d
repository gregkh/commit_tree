iio: adc: at91: fix acking DRDY irq on simple conversions

When doing simple conversions, the driver did not acknowledge the DRDY irq.
If this irq status is not acked, it will be left pending, and as soon as a
trigger is enabled, the irq handler will be called, it doesn't know why
this status has occurred because no channel is pending, and then it will go
int a irq loop and board will hang.
To avoid this situation, read the LCDR after a raw conversion is done.
