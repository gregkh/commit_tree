netfilter: nfnetlink_cttimeout: fetch timeouts for udplite and gre, too

syzbot was able to trigger the WARN in cttimeout_default_get() by
passing UDPLITE as l4protocol.  Alias UDPLITE to UDP, both use
same timeout values.

Furthermore, also fetch GRE timeouts.  GRE is a bit more complicated,
as it still can be a module and its netns_proto_gre struct layout isn't
visible outside of the gre module. Can't move timeouts around, it
appears conntrack sysctl unregister assumes net_generic() returns
nf_proto_net, so we get crash. Expose layout of netns_proto_gre instead.

A followup nf-next patch could make gre tracker be built-in as well
if needed, its not that large.

Last, make the WARN() mention the missing protocol value in case
anything else is missing.
