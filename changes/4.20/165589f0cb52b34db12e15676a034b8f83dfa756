nvmem: make the naming of arguments in nvmem_cell_get() consistent

The argument representing the cell name in the nvmem_cell_get() family
of functions is not consistend between function prototypes and
definitions. Name it 'id' in all those routines. This is in line with
other frameworks and can represent both the DT cell name from the
nvmem-cell-names property as well as the con_id field from cell
lookup entries.
