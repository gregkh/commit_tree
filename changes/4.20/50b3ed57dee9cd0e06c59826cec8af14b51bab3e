selftests/bpf: test bpf flow dissection

Adds a test that sends different types of packets over multiple
tunnels and verifies that valid packets are dissected correctly.  To do
so, a tc-flower rule is added to drop packets on UDP src port 9, and
packets are sent from ports 8, 9, and 10. Only the packets on port 9
should be dropped. Because tc-flower relies on the flow dissector to
match flows, correct classification demonstrates correct dissection.

Also add support logic to load the BPF program and to inject the test
packets.
