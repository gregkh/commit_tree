mm/khugepaged: minor reorderings in collapse_shmem()

Several cleanups in collapse_shmem(): most of which probably do not
really matter, beyond doing things in a more familiar and reassuring
order.  Simplify the failure gotos in the main loop, and on success
update stats while interrupts still disabled from the last iteration.
