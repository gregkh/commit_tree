mm/khugepaged: fix crashes due to misaccounted holes

Huge tmpfs testing on a shortish file mapped into a pmd-rounded extent
hit shmem_evict_inode()'s WARN_ON(inode->i_blocks) followed by
clear_inode()'s BUG_ON(inode->i_data.nrpages) when the file was later
closed and unlinked.

khugepaged's collapse_shmem() was forgetting to update mapping->nrpages
on the rollback path, after it had added but then needs to undo some
holes.

There is indeed an irritating asymmetry between shmem_charge(), whose
callers want it to increment nrpages after successfully accounting
blocks, and shmem_uncharge(), when __delete_from_page_cache() already
decremented nrpages itself: oh well, just add a comment on that to them
both.

And shmem_recalc_inode() is supposed to be called when the accounting is
expected to be in balance (so it can deduce from imbalance that reclaim
discarded some pages): so change shmem_charge() to update nrpages
earlier (though it's rare for the difference to matter at all).
