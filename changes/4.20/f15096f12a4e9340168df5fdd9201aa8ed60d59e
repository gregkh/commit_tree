ARM: dts: imx7d-nitrogen7: Fix the description of the Wifi clock

According to bindings/regulator/fixed-regulator.txt the 'clocks' and
'clock-names' properties are not valid ones.

In order to turn on the Wifi clock the correct location for describing
the CLKO2 clock is via a mmc-pwrseq handle, so do it accordingly.
