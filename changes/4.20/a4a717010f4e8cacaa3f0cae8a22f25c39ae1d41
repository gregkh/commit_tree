drm/i915: Unmask user interrupts writes into HWSP on snb/ivb/vlv/hsw

An oddity occurs on Sandybridge, Ivybridge and Haswell (and presumably
Valleyview) in that for the period following the GPU restart after a
reset, there are no GT interrupts received. From Ville's notes, bit 0 in
the HWSTAM corresponds to the render interrupt, and if we unmask it we
do see immediate resumption of GT interrupt delivery (via the master irq
handler) after the reset.

v2: Limit the w/a to the render interrupt from rcs
