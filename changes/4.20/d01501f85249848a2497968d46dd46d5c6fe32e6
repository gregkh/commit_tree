MIPS: Fix `dma_alloc_coherent' returning a non-coherent allocation

Fix a MIPS `dma_alloc_coherent' regression from commit bc3ec75de545
("dma-mapping: merge direct and noncoherent ops") that causes a cached
allocation to be returned on noncoherent cache systems.

This is due to an inverted check now used in the MIPS implementation of
`arch_dma_alloc' on the result from `dma_direct_alloc_pages' before
doing the cached-to-uncached mapping of the allocation address obtained.
The mapping has to be done for a non-NULL rather than NULL result,
because a NULL result means the allocation has failed.

Invert the check for correct operation then.
