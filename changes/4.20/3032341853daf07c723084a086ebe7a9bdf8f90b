KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add one-reg interface to virtual PTCR register

This adds a one-reg register identifier which can be used to read and
set the virtual PTCR for the guest.  This register identifies the
address and size of the virtual partition table for the guest, which
contains information about the nested guests under this guest.

Migrating this value is the only extra requirement for migrating a
guest which has nested guests (assuming of course that the destination
host supports nested virtualization in the kvm-hv module).
