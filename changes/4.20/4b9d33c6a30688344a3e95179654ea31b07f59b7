serial: uartps: Fix suspend functionality

The driver's suspend/resume functions were buggy.
If UART node contains any child node in the DT and
the child is established a communication path with
the parent UART. The relevant /dev/ttyPS* node will
be not available for other operations.
If the driver is trying to do any operations like
suspend/resume without checking the tty->dev status
it leads to the kernel crash/hang.

This patch fix this issue by call the device_may_wake()
with the generic parameter of type struct device.
in the uart suspend and resume paths.

It also fixes a race condition in the uart suspend
path(i.e uart_suspend_port() should be called at the
end of cdns_uart_suspend API this path updates the same)
