acpi, nfit: Collect shutdown status

Some NVDIMMs, in addition to providing an indication of whether the
previous shutdown was clean, also provide a running count of lifetime
dirty-shutdown events for the device. In anticipation of this
functionality appearing on more devices arrange for the nfit driver to
retrieve / cache this data at DIMM discovery time, and export it via
sysfs.
