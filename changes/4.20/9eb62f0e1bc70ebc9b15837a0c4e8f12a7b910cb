kdb: kdb_main: refactor code in kdb_md_line

Replace the whole switch statement with a for loop.  This makes the
code clearer and easy to read.

This also addresses the following Coverity warnings:

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 115090 ("Missing break in switch")
Addresses-Coverity-ID: 115091 ("Missing break in switch")
Addresses-Coverity-ID: 114700 ("Missing break in switch")
