arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Orange Pi Win: Add UARTs

The Orange Pi Win exposes several UARTs on header pins, and connects one
to the on-board WiFi/Bluetooth chip.

Add the pinmux definitions to the UART nodes, but keep them disabled.
Enable the UART1, which is wired to the Bluetooth chip, and add a serdev
node. There is no binding for the BT8723 yet, so leave this mostly empty
for now.
