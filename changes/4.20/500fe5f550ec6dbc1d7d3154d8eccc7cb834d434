powerpc/cacheinfo: Report the correct shared_cpu_map on big-cores

Currently on POWER9 SMT8 cores systems, in sysfs, we report the
shared_cache_map for L1 caches (both data and instruction) to be the
cpu-ids of the threads in SMT8 cores. This is incorrect since on
POWER9 SMT8 cores there are two groups of threads, each of which
shares its own L1 cache.

This patch addresses this by reporting the shared_cpu_map correctly in
sysfs for L1 caches.

Before the patch
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/shared_cpu_map : 000000ff
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index1/shared_cpu_map : 000000ff
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cache/index0/shared_cpu_map : 000000ff
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cache/index1/shared_cpu_map : 000000ff

After the patch
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/shared_cpu_map : 00000055
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index1/shared_cpu_map : 00000055
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cache/index0/shared_cpu_map : 000000aa
