powerpc/sysdev/ipic: check primary_ipic NULL pointer before using it

ipic_get_mcp_status() is used by targets implementing NMI
watchdog in target specific machine check handler in order
to known whether a machine check results from a watchdog
NMI reset.

In case of very early machine check, primary_ipic pointer
might not have been set yet, so ipic_get_mcp_status() needs
to check it for nullity before using it.
