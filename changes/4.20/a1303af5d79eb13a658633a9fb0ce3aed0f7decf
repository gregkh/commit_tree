tracing: probeevent: Add $argN for accessing function args

Add $argN special fetch variable for accessing function
arguments. This allows user to trace the Nth argument easily
at the function entry.

Note that this returns most probably assignment of registers
and stacks. In some case, it may not work well. If you need
to access correct registers or stacks you should use perf-probe.
