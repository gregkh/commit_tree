KEYS: trusted: Expose common functionality [ver #2]

This patch exposes some common functionality needed to send TPM commands.
Several functions from keys/trusted.c are exposed for use by the new tpm
key subtype and a module dependency is introduced.

In the future, common functionality between the trusted key type and the
asym_tpm subtype should be factored out into a common utility library.
