hwmon: (k10temp) Support all Family 15h Model 6xh and Model 7xh processors

BIOS developer guides refer to Family 15h Models 60h-6fh and Family 15h
Models 70h-7fh. So far the driver only checked for Models 60h and 70h.
However, there are now processors with other model numbers in the same
families. Example is A10-9620P family 15h model 65h. Follow the developer
guides and mask the lower 4 bit of the model number to determine the
registers to use for reading temperatures and temperature limits.
