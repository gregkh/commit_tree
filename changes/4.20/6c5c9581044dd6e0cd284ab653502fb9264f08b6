net: add napi_if_scheduled_mark_missed

The function napi_if_scheduled_mark_missed is used to check if the
NAPI context is scheduled, if so set NAPIF_STATE_MISSED and return
true. Used by the AF_XDP zero-copy i40e Tx code implementation in
order to make sure that irq affinity is honored by the napi context.
