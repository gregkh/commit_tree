drm/i915/gvt: only copy the first page for restore inhibit context

if a context is a restore inhibit context, gfx hw only load the first page
for ring context, so we only need to copy from guest the 1 page too.

v3: use "return" instead of "goto" for inhibit case. (zhenyu wang)
v2: move judgement of restore inhibit to a macro in  mmio_context.h
