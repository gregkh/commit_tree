arm64: arch_timer: avoid unused function warning

arm64_1188873_read_cntvct_el0() is protected by the correct
CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_1188873 #ifdef, but the only reference to it is
also inside of an CONFIG_ARM_ARCH_TIMER_OOL_WORKAROUND section,
and causes a warning if that is disabled:

drivers/clocksource/arm_arch_timer.c:323:20: error: 'arm64_1188873_read_cntvct_el0' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Since the erratum requires that we always apply the workaround
in the timer driver, select that symbol as we do for SoC
specific errata.
