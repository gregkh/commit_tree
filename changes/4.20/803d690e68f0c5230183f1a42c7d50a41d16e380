powerpc/mm: Don't report hugepage tables as memory leaks when using kmemleak

When a process allocates a hugepage, the following leak is
reported by kmemleak. This is a false positive which is
due to the pointer to the table being stored in the PGD
as physical memory address and not virtual memory pointer.

unreferenced object 0xc30f8200 (size 512):
  comm "mmap", pid 374, jiffies 4872494 (age 627.630s)

See commit a984506c542e2 ("powerpc/mm: Don't report PUDs as
memory leaks when using kmemleak") for detailed explanation.

To fix that, this patch tells kmemleak to ignore the allocated
hugepage table.
