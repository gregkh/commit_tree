ice: Introduce ice_dev_onetime_setup

ice_dev_onetime_setup contains a couple of driver workarounds for current
firmware limitations. These workarounds are expected to go away once
these limitations are fixed in the firmware.

On a firmware release that has these issues addressed, these workarounds
(while unnecessary) will not break anything.
