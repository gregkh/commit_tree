coresight: perf: Fix per cpu path management

We create a coresight trace path for each online CPU when
we start the event. We rely on the number of online CPUs
and then go on to allocate an array matching the "number of
online CPUs" for holding the path and then uses normal
CPU id as the index to the array. This is problematic as
we could have some offline CPUs causing us to access beyond
the actual array size (e.g, on a dual SMP system, if CPU0 is
offline, CPU1 could be really accessing beyond the array).
The solution is to switch to per-cpu array for holding the path.
