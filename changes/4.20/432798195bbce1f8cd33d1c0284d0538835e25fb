uio: Fix an Oops on load

I was trying to solve a double free but I introduced a more serious
NULL dereference bug.  The problem is that if there is an IRQ which
triggers immediately, then we need "info->uio_dev" but it's not set yet.

This patch puts the original initialization back to how it was and just
sets info->uio_dev to NULL on the error path so it should solve both
the Oops and the double free.

Fixes: f019f07ecf6a ("uio: potential double frees if __uio_register_device() fails")
