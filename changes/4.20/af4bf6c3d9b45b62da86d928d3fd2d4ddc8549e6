s390/mm: optimize locking without huge pages in gmap_pmd_op_walk()

Right now we temporarily take the page table lock in
gmap_pmd_op_walk() even though we know we won't need it (if we can
never have 1mb pages mapped into the gmap).

Let's make this a special case, so gmap_protect_range() and
gmap_sync_dirty_log_pmd() will not take the lock when huge pages are
not allowed.

gmap_protect_range() is called quite frequently for managing shadow
page tables in vSIE environments.
