drm/amd/display: Drop reusing drm connector for MST

[why]
It is not safe to keep existing connector while entire topology
has been removed. Could lead potential impact to uapi.
Entirely unregister all the connectors on the topology,
and use a new set of connectors when the topology is plugged back
on.

[How]
Remove the drm connector entirely each time when the
corresponding MST topology is gone.
When hotunplug a connector (e.g., DP2)
1. Remove connector from userspace.
2. Drop it's reference.
When hotplug back on:
1. Detect new topology, and create new connectors.
2. Notify userspace with sysfs hotplug event.
3. Reprobe new connectors, and reassign CRTC from old (e.g., DP2)
to new (e.g., DP3) connector.
