drm: do not mask out DRM_FORMAT_BIG_ENDIAN

framebuffer_check() expects that drm_get_format_info() will not fail if
the __drm_format_info() call was successful.  That'll work only in case
both are called with the same pixel_format value, so masking out the
DRM_FORMAT_BIG_ENDIAN flag isn't a good idea.
