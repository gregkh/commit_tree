fsnotify: generalize handling of extra event flags

FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD gets a special treatment in fsnotify() because it is
not a flag specifying an event type, but rather an extra flags that may
be reported along with another event and control the handling of the
event by the backend.

FS_ISDIR is also an "extra flag" and not an "event type" and therefore
desrves the same treatment. With inotify/dnotify backends it was never
possible to set FS_ISDIR in mark masks, so it did not matter.
With fanotify backend, mark adding code jumps through hoops to avoid
setting the FS_ISDIR in the commulative object mask.

Separate the constant ALL_FSNOTIFY_EVENTS to ALL_FSNOTIFY_FLAGS and
ALL_FSNOTIFY_EVENTS, so the latter can be used to test for specific
event types.
