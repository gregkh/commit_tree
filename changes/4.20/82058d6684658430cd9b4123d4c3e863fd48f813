signal: Use group_send_sig_info to kill all processes in a pid namespace

Replace send_sig_info in zap_pid_ns_processes with
group_send_sig_info.  This makes more sense as the entire process
group is being killed.  More importantly this allows the kill of those
processes with PIDTYPE_MAX to indicate all of the process in the pid
namespace are being signaled.  This is needed for fork to detect when
signals are sent to a group of processes.

Admittedly fork has another case to catch SIGKILL but the principle remains
that it is desirable to know when a group of processes is being signaled.
