selftests/powerpc: Adjust wild_bctr to build with old binutils

Currently the selftest wild_bctr can fail to build when an old gcc is
used, notably on gcc using a binutils version <= 2.27, because the
assembler does not support the integer suffix UL.

This patch adjusts the wild_bctr test so the REG_POISON value is still
treated as an unsigned long for the shifts on compilation but the UL
suffix is absent on the stringification, so the inline asm code
generated has no UL suffixes.
