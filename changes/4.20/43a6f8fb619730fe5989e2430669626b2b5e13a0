nvmet: use strcmp() instead of strncmp() for subsystem lookup

strncmp() stops comparing when either the end of one of the first two arguments
is reached or when 'n' characters have been compared, whichever comes first.
That means that strncmp(s1, s2, n) is equivalent to strcmp(s1, s2) if n exceeds
the length of s1 or the length of s2. Since that is the case in
nvmet_find_get_subsys(), change strncmp() into strcmp(). This patch avoids that
the following warning is reported by smatch:

drivers/nvme/target/core.c:940:1 nvmet_find_get_subsys() error: strncmp() '"nqn.2014-08.org.nvmexpress.discovery"' too small (37 vs 223)
