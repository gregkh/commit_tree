net: fddi: skfp: Remove unused function

Clang warns when a variable is assigned to itself.

drivers/net/fddi/skfp/pcmplc.c:1257:6: warning: explicitly assigning
value of variable of type 'int' to itself [-Wself-assign]
        phy = phy ; on_off = on_off ;
        ~~~ ^ ~~~

        phy = phy ; on_off = on_off ;
                    ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~

Turns out this entire function doesn't actually do anything since
SK_UNUSED is just casting the pointer to void. Remove it to silence
this Clang warning.
