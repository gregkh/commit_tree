usbip: tools: fix atoi() on non-null terminated string

Currently the call to atoi is being passed a single char string
that is not null terminated, so there is a potential read overrun
along the stack when parsing for an integer value.  Fix this by
instead using a 2 char string that is initialized to all zeros
to ensure that a 1 char read into the string is always terminated
with a \0.

Detected by cppcheck:
"Invalid atoi() argument nr 1. A nul-terminated string is required."
