y2038: __get_old_timespec32() can be static

The kbuild test robot reports two new warnings with the previous
patch:

 kernel/time/time.c:866:5: sparse: symbol '__get_old_timespec32' was not declared. Should it be static?
 kernel/time/time.c:882:5: sparse: symbol '__put_old_timespec32' was not declared. Should it be static?

These are actually older bugs, but came up now after the
symbol got renamed. Fortunately, commit afef05cf238c ("time:
Enable get/put_compat_itimerspec64 always") makes the two functions
(__compat_get_timespec64/__compat_get_timespec64) local to time.c already,
so we can mark them as 'static'.
