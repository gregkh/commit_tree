qed: Fix rdma_info structure allocation

Certain flows need to access the rdma-info structure, for example dcbx
update flows. In some cases there can be a race between the allocation or
deallocation of the structure which was done in roce start / roce stop and
an asynchrounous dcbx event that tries to access the structure.
For this reason, we move the allocation of the rdma_info structure to be
similar to the iscsi/fcoe info structures which are allocated during device
setup.
We add a new field of "active" to the struct to define whether roce has
already been started or not, and this is checked instead of whether the
pointer to the info structure.
