mm/swapfile.c: clear si->swap_map[] in swap_free_cluster()

si->swap_map[] of the swap entries in cluster needs to be cleared during
freeing.  Previously, this is done in the caller of swap_free_cluster().
This may cause code duplication (one user now, will add more users later)
and lock/unlock cluster unnecessarily.  In this patch, the clearing code
is moved to swap_free_cluster() to avoid the downside.
