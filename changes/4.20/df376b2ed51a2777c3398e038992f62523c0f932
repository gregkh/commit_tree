block: respect virtual boundary mask in bvecs

With drivers that are settting a virtual boundary constrain, we are
seeing a lot of bio splitting and smaller I/Os being submitted to the
driver.

This happens because the bio gap detection code does not account cases
where PAGE_SIZE - 1 is bigger than queue_virt_boundary() and thus will
split the bio unnecessarily.
