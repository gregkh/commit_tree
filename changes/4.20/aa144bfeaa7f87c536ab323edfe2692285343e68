btrfs: dev-replace: avoid useless lock on error handling path

The exit sequence in btrfs_dev_replace_start does not allow to simply
add a label to the right place so the error handling after starting
transaction failure jumps there. Currently there's a lock that pairs
with the unlock in the section, which is unnecessary and only raises
questions.  Add a variable to track the locking status and avoid the
extra locking.
