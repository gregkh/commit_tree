clk: qcom: Add safe switch hook for krait mux clocks

When the Hfplls are reprogrammed during the rate change,
the primary muxes which are sourced from the same hfpll
for higher frequencies, needs to be switched to the 'safe
secondary mux' as the parent for that small window. This
is done by registering a clk notifier for the muxes and
switching to the safe parent in the PRE_RATE_CHANGE notifier
and back to the original parent in the POST_RATE_CHANGE notifier.
