soc: qcom: smem: require order of host ids to match

In qcom_smem_enumerate_partitions(), we find all partitions that
have a given local host id in either its host0 or its host1 field
in the partition table entry.  We then verify that the header
structure at the start of each partition also contains the same two
host ids as is found in the table of contents.

There is no requirement that the order of the two host ids be the
same in the table of contents and in the partition header.

This patch changes that, requiring host0 to in the partition table
entry to equal host0 in the partition header structure (and similar
for the host1 values).
