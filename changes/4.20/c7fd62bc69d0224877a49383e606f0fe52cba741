stm class: Introduce framing protocol drivers

At the moment, the stm class applies a certain STP framing pattern to
the data as it is written to the underlying STM device. In order to
allow different framing patterns (aka protocols), this patch introduces
the concept of STP protocol drivers, defines data structures and APIs
for the protocol drivers to use.
