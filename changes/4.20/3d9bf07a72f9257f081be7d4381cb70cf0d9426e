iio: adc: meson-saradc: remove #define MESON_SAR_ADC_DELTA_10_TS_C_SHIFT

This define is of no use because the driver is avoiding shifting bits
by itself but using FIELD_GET/FIELD_PREP (which are using bit masks)
instead. There is already a MESON_SAR_ADC_DELTA_10_TS_C_MASK bit mask so
MESON_SAR_ADC_DELTA_10_TS_C_SHIFT was redundant.
