netlink: add ethernet address policy types

Commonly, ethernet addresses are just using a policy of
	{ .len = ETH_ALEN }
which leaves userspace free to send more data than it should,
which may hide bugs.

Introduce NLA_EXACT_LEN which checks for exact size, rejecting
the attribute if it's not exactly that length. Also add
NLA_EXACT_LEN_WARN which requires the minimum length and will
warn on longer attributes, for backward compatibility.

Use these to define NLA_POLICY_ETH_ADDR (new strict policy) and
NLA_POLICY_ETH_ADDR_COMPAT (compatible policy with warning);
these are used like this:

    static const struct nla_policy <name>[...] = {
        [NL_ATTR_NAME] = NLA_POLICY_ETH_ADDR,
        ...
    };
