signal: Properly deliver SIGSEGV from x86 uprobes

For userspace to tell the difference between an random signal
and an exception, the exception must include siginfo information.

Using SEND_SIG_FORCED for SIGSEGV is thus wrong, and it will result in
userspace seeing si_code == SI_USER (like a random signal) instead of
si_code == SI_KERNEL or a more specific si_code as all exceptions
deliver.

Therefore replace force_sig_info(SIGSEGV, SEND_SIG_FORCE, current)
with force_sig(SIG_SEGV, current) which gets this right and is shorter
and easier to type.
