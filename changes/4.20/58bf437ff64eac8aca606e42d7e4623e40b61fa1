arm/arm64: KVM: Enable 32 bits kvm vcpu events support

The commit 539aee0edb9f ("KVM: arm64: Share the parts of
get/set events useful to 32bit") shares the get/set events
helper for arm64 and arm32, but forgot to share the cap
extension code.

User space will check whether KVM supports vcpu events by
checking the KVM_CAP_VCPU_EVENTS extension
