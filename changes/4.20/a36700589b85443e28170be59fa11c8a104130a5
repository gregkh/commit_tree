signal: Guard against negative signal numbers in copy_siginfo_from_user32

While fixing an out of bounds array access in known_siginfo_layout
reported by the kernel test robot it became apparent that the same bug
exists in siginfo_layout and affects copy_siginfo_from_user32.

The straight forward fix that makes guards against making this mistake
in the future and should keep the code size small is to just take an
unsigned signal number instead of a signed signal number, as I did to
fix known_siginfo_layout.
