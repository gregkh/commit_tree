fanotify: add API to attach/detach super block mark

Add another mark type flag FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM for add/remove/flush
of super block mark type.

A super block watch gets all events on the filesystem, regardless of
the mount from which the mark was added, unless an ignore mask exists
on either the inode or the mount where the event was generated.

Only one of FAN_MARK_MOUNT and FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM mark type flags
may be provided to fanotify_mark() or no mark type flag for inode mark.
