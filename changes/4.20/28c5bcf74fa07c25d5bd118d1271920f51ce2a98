KVM: PPC: Move and undef TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH/FILE

TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH and TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE are used by
<trace/define_trace.h>, so like that #include, they should
be outside #ifdef protection.

They also need to be #undefed before defining, in case multiple trace
headers are included by the same C file.  This became the case on
book3e after commit cf4a6085151a ("powerpc/mm: Add missing tracepoint for
tlbie"), leading to the following build error:
