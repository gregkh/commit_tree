x86/mm/cpa: Avoid the 4k pages check completely

The extra loop which tries hard to preserve large pages in case of conflicts
with static protection regions turns out to be not preserving anything, at
least not in the experiments which have been conducted.

There might be corner cases in which the code would be able to preserve a
large page oaccsionally, but it's really not worth the extra code and the
cycles wasted in the common case.

Before:

 1G pages checked:                    2
 1G pages sameprot:                   0
 1G pages preserved:                  0
 2M pages checked:                  541
 2M pages sameprot:                 466
 2M pages preserved:                 47
 4K pages checked:                  514
 4K pages set-checked:             7668

After:
 1G pages checked:                    2
 1G pages sameprot:                   0
 1G pages preserved:                  0
 2M pages checked:                  538
 2M pages sameprot:                 466
 2M pages preserved:                 47
 4K pages set-checked:             7668
