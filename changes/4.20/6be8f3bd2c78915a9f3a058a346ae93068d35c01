drm/fb: Stop leaking physical address

For buffer sharing, use dma-buf instead. We can't set smem_start to 0
unconditionally since that's used by the fbdev mmap default
implementation. And we have plenty of userspace which would like to
keep that working.

This might break legit userspace - if it does we need to look at a
case-by-cases basis how to handle that. Worst case I expect overrides
for only specific drivers, since anything remotely modern should be
using dma-buf/prime now (which is about 7 years old now for DRM
drivers).

This issue was uncovered because Noralf's rework to implement a
generic fb_probe also implements it's own fb_mmap callback. Which
means smem_start didn't have to be set anymore, which blew up some
blob in userspace rather badly.
