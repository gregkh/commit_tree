mwifex: free rx_cmd skb in suspended state

USB suspend handler will kill the presubmitted rx_cmd URB. This
triggers a call to the corresponding URB complete handler, which
will free the rx_cmd skb, associated with rx_cmd URB. Due to a
possible race betwen suspend handler and main thread, depicted in
'commit bfcacac6c84b ("mwifiex: do no submit URB in suspended
state")', it is possible that the rx_cmd skb will fail to get
freed. This causes a memory leak, since the resume handler will
always allocate a new rx_cmd skb.

To fix this, free the rx_cmd skb in mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb, if
the device is in suspended state.
