arm64/mm: Define esr_to_debug_fault_info()

fault_info[] and debug_fault_info[] are static arrays defining memory abort
exception handling functions looking into ESR fault status code encodings.
As esr_to_fault_info() is already available providing fault_info[] array
lookup, it really makes sense to have a corresponding debug_fault_info[]
array lookup function as well. This just adds an equivalent helper function
esr_to_debug_fault_info().
