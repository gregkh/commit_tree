xen-swiotlb: use actually allocated size on check physical continuous

xen_swiotlb_{alloc,free}_coherent() allocate/free memory based on the
order of the pages and not size argument (bytes). This is inconsistent with
range_straddles_page_boundary and memset which use the 'size' value,
which may lead to not exchanging memory with Xen (range_straddles_page_boundary()
returned true). And then the call to xen_swiotlb_free_coherent() would
actually try to exchange the memory with Xen, leading to the kernel
hitting an BUG (as the hypercall returned an error).

This patch fixes it by making the 'size' variable be of the same size
as the amount of memory allocated.
