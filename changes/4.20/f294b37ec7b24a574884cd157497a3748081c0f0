bpf: rework cgroup storage pointer passing

To simplify the following introduction of per-cpu cgroup storage,
let's rework a bit a mechanism of passing a pointer to a cgroup
storage into the bpf_get_local_storage(). Let's save a pointer
to the corresponding bpf_cgroup_storage structure, instead of
a pointer to the actual buffer.

It will help us to handle per-cpu storage later, which has
a different way of accessing to the actual data.
