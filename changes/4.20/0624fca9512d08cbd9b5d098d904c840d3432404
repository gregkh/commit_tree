kvm/x86: return meaningful value from KVM_SIGNAL_MSI

If kvm_apic_map_get_dest_lapic() finds a disabled LAPIC,
it will return with bitmap==0 and (*r == -1) will be returned to
userspace.

QEMU may then record "KVM: injection failed, MSI lost
(Operation not permitted)" in its log, which is quite puzzling.
