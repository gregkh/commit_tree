clk: samsung: exynos5433: Add suspend state for TOP, CPIF & PERIC CMUs

Before entering system suspend, one has to ensure that some clocks from
TOP, CPIF and PERIC CMUs are enabled. This is needed by the firmware
to properly perform system suspend operation. Instead of adding more and
more clocks with CRITICAL flag, simply enable those clocks directly in
respective CMU registers using 'suspend_regs' feature.
