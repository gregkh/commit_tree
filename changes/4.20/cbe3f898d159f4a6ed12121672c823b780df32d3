x86/kvm/nVMX: tweak shadow fields

It seems we have some leftovers from times when 'unrestricted guest'
wasn't exposed to L1. Stop shadowing GUEST_CS_{BASE,LIMIT,AR_SELECTOR}
and GUEST_ES_BASE, shadow GUEST_SS_AR_BYTES as it was found that some
hypervisors (e.g. Hyper-V without Enlightened VMCS) access it pretty
often.
