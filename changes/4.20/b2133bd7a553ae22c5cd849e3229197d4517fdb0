powerpc/book3s/32: do not include pte-common.h

As done for book3s/64, add necessary flags/defines in
book3s/32/pgtable.h and do not include pte-common.h

It allows in the meantime to remove all related hash
definitions from pte-common.h and to also remove
_PAGE_EXEC default as _PAGE_EXEC is defined on all
platforms except book3s/32.
