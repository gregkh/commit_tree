function_graph: Have profiler use curr_ret_stack and not depth

The profiler uses trace->depth to find its entry on the ret_stack, but the
depth may not match the actual location of where its entry is (if an
interrupt were to preempt the processing of the profiler for another
function, the depth and the curr_ret_stack will be different).

Have it use the curr_ret_stack as the index to find its ret_stack entry
instead of using the depth variable, as that is no longer guaranteed to be
the same.
