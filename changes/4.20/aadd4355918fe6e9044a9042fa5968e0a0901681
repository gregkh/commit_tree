tcp, ulp: remove socket lock assertion on ULP cleanup

Eric reported that syzkaller triggered a splat in tcp_cleanup_ulp()
where assertion sock_owned_by_me() failed. This happened through
inet_csk_prepare_forced_close() first releasing the socket lock,
then calling into tcp_done(newsk) which is called after the
inet_csk_prepare_forced_close() and therefore without the socket
lock held. The sock_owned_by_me() assertion can generally be
removed as the only place where tcp_cleanup_ulp() is called from
now is out of inet_csk_destroy_sock() -> sk->sk_prot->destroy()
where socket is in dead state and unreachable. Therefore, add a
comment why the check is not needed instead.
