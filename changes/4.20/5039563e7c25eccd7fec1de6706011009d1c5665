spi: Add driver_override SPI device attribute

This attribute works the same was as the identically named attribute
for PCI, AMBA, and platform devices.  For reference, see:

commit 3cf385713460 ("ARM: 8256/1: driver coamba: add device binding
path 'driver_override'")
commit 3d713e0e382e ("driver core: platform: add device binding path
'driver_override'")
commit 782a985d7af2 ("PCI: Introduce new device binding path using
pci_dev.driver_override")

If the name of a driver is written to this attribute, then the device
will bind to the named driver and only the named driver.

The device will bind to the driver even if the driver does not list the
device in its id table.  This behavior is different than the driver's
bind attribute, which only allows binding to devices that are listed as
supported by the driver.

It can be used to bind a generic driver, like spidev, to a device.
