ALSA: rawmidi: A lightweight function to discard pending bytes

For discarding the pending bytes on rawmidi, we process with a loop of
snd_rawmidi_transmit() which is just a waste of CPU power.
Implement a lightweight API function to discard the pending bytes and
the proceed the ring buffer instantly, and use it instead of open
codes.
