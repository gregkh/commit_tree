acpi, nfit: Further restrict userspace ARS start requests

In addition to not allowing ARS start while the background thread is
actively running, prevent ARS start while any scrub request is pending.

This aligns the window for ARS start submission with the status of ARS
reported via sysfs. Previously userspace could sneak its own ARS start
requests in while sysfs reported -EBUSY.
