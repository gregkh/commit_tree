perf trace: Drop addr_location refcounts

When we use machine__resolve() we grab a reference to
addr_location.thread (and in the future to other elements there) via
machine__findnew_thread(), so we must pair that with
addr_location__put(), else we'll never drop that thread when it exits
and no other remaining data structures have pointers to it. Fix it.
