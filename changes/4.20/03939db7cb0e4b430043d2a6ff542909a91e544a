media: vsp1: Document max_width restriction on UDS

The UDS is currently restricted based on a partition size of 256 pixels.
Document the actual restrictions, but don't increase the implementation.

The extended partition algorithm may later choose to utilise a larger
partition size to support overlapping partitions which will improve the
quality of the output images.
