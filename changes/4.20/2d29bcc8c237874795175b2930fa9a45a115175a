media: tvp5150: fix switch exit in set control handler

The function only consists of a single switch case block without a
default case. Unsupported control requests are indicated by the -EINVAL
return code trough the last return statement at the end of the function. So
exiting just the switch case block returns the -EINVAL error code but the
hue control is supported and a zero should be returned instead.

Replace the break by a 'return 0' to fix this behaviour.

control handler")
