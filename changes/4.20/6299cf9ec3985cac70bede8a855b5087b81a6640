PCI / ACPI: Enable wake automatically for power managed bridges

We enable power management automatically for bridges where
pci_bridge_d3_possible() returns true. However, these bridges may have
ACPI methods such as _DSW that need to be called before D3 entry. For
example in Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th _DSW method is used to prepare
D3cold for the PCIe root port hosting Thunderbolt chain. Because wake is
not enabled _DSW method is never called and the port does not enter
D3cold properly consuming more power than necessary.

Users can work this around by writing "enabled" to "wakeup" sysfs file
under the device in question but that is not something an ordinary user
is expected to do.

Since we already automatically enable power management for PCIe ports
with ->bridge_d3 set extend that to enable wake for them as well,
assuming the port has any ACPI wakeup related objects implemented in the
namespace (adev->wakeup.flags.valid is true). This ensures the necessary
ACPI methods get called at appropriate times and allows the root port in
Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th to go into D3cold.
