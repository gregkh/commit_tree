trace_uprobe/sdt: Prevent multiple reference counter for same uprobe

We assume to have only one reference counter for one uprobe.
Don't allow user to add multiple trace_uprobe entries having
same inode+offset but different reference counter.

Ex,
  # echo "p:sdt_tick/loop2 /home/ravi/tick:0x6e4(0x10036)" > uprobe_events
  # echo "p:sdt_tick/loop2_1 /home/ravi/tick:0x6e4(0xfffff)" >> uprobe_events
  bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

  # dmesg
  trace_kprobe: Reference counter offset mismatch.

There is one exception though:
When user is trying to replace the old entry with the new
one, we allow this if the new entry does not conflict with
any other existing entries.
