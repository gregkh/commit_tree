drm/amd/display: fix dml handling of mono8/16 pixel formats

mono formats are treated exactly the same as equivallent bpp
444 formats. Dml validation however lacks 444 8 bit format
while dml perf param calculation lacks mono format support

This change makes them equivallent as far as the enum is concerned
to avoid having to update dml
