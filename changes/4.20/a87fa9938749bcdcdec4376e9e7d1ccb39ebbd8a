drm/amd/display: Build stream update and plane updates in dm

[Why]
We currently lock modeset by setting a boolean in dm. We want to lock
Based on what DC tells us.

[How]
Build stream_updates and plane_update based on what changed. Then we
call check_update_surfaces_for_stream() to get the update type
We lock only if update_type is not fast
