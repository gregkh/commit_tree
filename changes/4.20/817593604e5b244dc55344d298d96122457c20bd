powerpc/time: Add set_state_oneshot_stopped decrementer callback

If CONFIG_PPC_WATCHDOG is enabled we always cap the decrementer to
0x7fffffff:

       if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PPC_WATCHDOG))
                set_dec(0x7fffffff);
        else
                set_dec(decrementer_max);

If there are no future events, we don't reprogram the decrementer
after this and we end up with 0x7fffffff even on a large decrementer
capable system.

As suggested by Nick, add a set_state_oneshot_stopped callback
so we program the decrementer with decrementer_max if there are
no future events.
