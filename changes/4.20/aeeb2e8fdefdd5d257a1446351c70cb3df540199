net: phy: phylink: ensure the carrier is off when starting phylink

Phylink made an assumption about the carrier state being down when
calling phylink_start(). If this assumption isn't satisfied, the
internal phylink state could misbehave and a net device could end up not
being functional.

This patch fixes this by explicitly calling netif_carrier_off() in
phylink_start().
