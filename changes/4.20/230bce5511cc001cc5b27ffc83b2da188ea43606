media: vsp1: Fix LIF buffer thresholds

Commit de2bc45c84f7 ("media: vsp1: Update LIF buffer thresholds")
updated the LIF buffer thresholds based on the VSP version, but used the
wrong model mask. This resulted in all VSP instances to be treated as a
Gen3 VSPD, breaking operation on all Gen2 platforms as well as on
H3 ES2.0, M3-N, V3M and V3H. Fix it.
