misc: mic: scif: Remove unused variable

Clang warns when a variable is assigned to itself.

drivers/misc/mic/scif/scif_dma.c:1577:12: warning: explicitly assigning
value of variable of type 'bool' (aka '_Bool') to itself [-Wself-assign]
        dst_local = dst_local;
        ~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~
1 warning generated.

This is usually done to avoid an unused variable warning, which is the
case here. dst_local is used nowhere in this function, which has been
the case since the initial code drop in commit 7cc31cd27752 ("misc: mic:
SCIF DMA and CPU copy interface") in 2015. Just remove the variable, it
can be added back if it was intended to be used.
