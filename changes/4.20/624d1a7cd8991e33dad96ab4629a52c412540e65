ASoC: rsnd: fixup SSI clock during suspend/resume modes

Prepare <-> Cleanup functions pair has balanced calls.
But in case of suspend mode no call to rsnd_soc_dai_shutdown()
function, so cleanup isn't called. OTOH during resume mode
function rsnd_soc_dai_prepare() is called, but calling
rsnd_ssi_prepare() is skipped (rsnd_status_update() returns zero,
bacause was not cleanup before).
We need to call rsnd_ssi_prepare(), because it enables SSI clocks
by calling rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start().

This patch allows to call prepare/cleanup functions always.
