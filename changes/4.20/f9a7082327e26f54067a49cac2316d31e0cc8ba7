drm/msm: fix OF child-node lookup

Use the new of_get_compatible_child() helper to lookup the legacy
pwrlevels child node instead of using of_find_compatible_node(), which
searches the entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an
unrelated (i.e.  non-child) node.

This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the probed device's node).

While at it, also fix the related child-node reference leak.
