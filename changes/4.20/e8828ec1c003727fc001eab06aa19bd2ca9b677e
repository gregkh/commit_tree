mtd: spi-nor: fix selection of uniform erase type in flexible conf

There are uniform, non-uniform and flexible erase flash configurations.

The non-uniform erase types, are the erase types that can _not_ erase
the entire flash by their own.

As the code was, in case flashes had flexible erase capabilities
(support both uniform and non-uniform erase types in the same flash
configuration) and supported multiple uniform erase type sizes, the
code did not sort the uniform erase types, and could select a wrong
erase type size.

Sort the uniform erase mask in case of flexible erase flash
configurations, in order to select the best uniform erase type size.

Uniform, non-uniform, and flexible configurations with just a valid
uniform erase type, are not affected by this change.

Uniform erase tested on mx25l3273fm2i-08g and sst26vf064B-104i/sn.
Non uniform erase tested on sst26vf064B-104i/sn.
