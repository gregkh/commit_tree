atm: eni: Move semicolon to a new line after empty for loop

Clang warns:

drivers/atm/eni.c:244:48: error: for loop has empty body
[-Werror,-Wempty-body]
        for (order = 0; (1 << order) < *size; order++);
                                                      ^
drivers/atm/eni.c:244:48: note: put the semicolon on a separate line to
silence this warning

In this case, that loop is expected to be empty so silence the warning
in the way that Clang suggests.
