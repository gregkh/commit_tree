stm class: Switch over to the protocol driver

Now that the default framing protocol is factored out into its own driver,
switch over to using the driver for writing data. To that end, make the
policy code require a valid protocol name (or absence thereof, which is
equivalent to "p_basic").

Also, to make transition easier, make stm class request "p_basic" module
at initialization time.
