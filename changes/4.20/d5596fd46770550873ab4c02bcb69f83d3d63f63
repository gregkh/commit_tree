i40e: enable NETIF_F_NTUPLE and NETIF_F_HW_TC at driver load

The assignment of the feature flag NETIF_F_NTUPLE and NETIF_F_HW_TC
occurs prior to the initial setup of the local hw_features variable.

This means the features are set as user-changeable, but are not set in
the currently active feature list. This results in the features being
disabled at the driver's initial load.

Move the assignment after the initial assignment of hw_features, and
assign to the local variable. This ensures that NETIF_F_NTUPLE and
NETIF_F_HW_TC are marked as user-changeable, and also enables them by
default when the driver loads.
