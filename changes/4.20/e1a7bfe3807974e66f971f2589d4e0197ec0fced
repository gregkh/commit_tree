ALSA: control: Fix race between adding and removing a user element

The procedure for adding a user control element has some window opened
for race against the concurrent removal of a user element.  This was
caught by syzkaller, hitting a KASAN use-after-free error.

This patch addresses the bug by wrapping the whole procedure to add a
user control element with the card->controls_rwsem, instead of only
around the increment of card->user_ctl_count.

This required a slight code refactoring, too.  The function
snd_ctl_add() is split to two parts: a core function to add the
control element and a part calling it.  The former is called from the
function for adding a user control element inside the controls_rwsem.

One change to be noted is that snd_ctl_notify() for adding a control
element gets called inside the controls_rwsem as well while it was
called outside the rwsem.  But this should be OK, as snd_ctl_notify()
takes another (finer) rwlock instead of rwsem, and the call of
snd_ctl_notify() inside rwsem is already done in another code path.
