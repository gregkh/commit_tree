signal: Always ignore SIGKILL and SIGSTOP sent to the global init

If the first process started (aka /sbin/init) receives a SIGKILL it
will panic the system if it is delivered.  Making the system unusable
and undebugable.  It isn't much better if the first process started
receives SIGSTOP.

So always ignore SIGSTOP and SIGKILL sent to init.

This is done in a separate clause in sig_task_ignored as force_sig_info
can clear SIG_UNKILLABLE and this protection should work even then.
