drm/i915: Use a cached mapping for the physical HWS

Older gen use a physical address for the hardware status page, for which
we use cache-coherent writes. As the writes are into the cpu cache, we use
a normal WB mapped page to read the HWS, used for our seqno tracking.

Anecdotally, I observed lost breadcrumbs writes into the HWS on i965gm,
which so far have not reoccurred with this patch. How reliable that
evidence is remains to be seen.

v2: Explicitly pass the expected physical address to the hw
v3: Also remember the wild writes we once had for HWS above 4G.
