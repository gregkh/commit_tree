ice: Split irq_tracker into sw_irq_tracker and hw_irq_tracker

For the PF driver, when mapping interrupts to queues, we need to request
IRQs from the kernel and we also have to allocate interrupts from
the device.

Similarly, when the VF driver (iavf.ko) initializes, it requests the kernel
IRQs that it needs but it can't directly allocate interrupts in the device.
Instead, it sends a mailbox message to the ice driver, which then allocates
interrupts in the device on the VF driver's behalf.

Currently both these cases end up having to reserve entries in
pf->irq_tracker but irq_tracker itself is sized based on how many vectors
the PF driver needs. Under the right circumstances, the VF driver can fail
to get entries in irq_tracker, which will result in the VF driver failing
probe.

To fix this, sw_irq_tracker and hw_irq_tracker are introduced. The
sw_irq_tracker tracks only the PF's IRQ request and doesn't play any
role in VF init. hw_irq_tracker represents the device's interrupt space.
When interrupts have to be allocated in the device for either PF or VF,
hw_irq_tracker will be looked up to see if the device has run out of
interrupts.
