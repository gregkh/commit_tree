media: platform: Add Cedrus VPU decoder driver

This introduces the Cedrus VPU driver that supports the VPU found in
Allwinner SoCs, also known as Video Engine. It is implemented through
a V4L2 M2M decoder device and a media device (used for media requests).
So far, it only supports MPEG-2 decoding.

Since this VPU is stateless, synchronization with media requests is
required in order to ensure consistency between frame headers that
contain metadata about the frame to process and the raw slice data that
is used to generate the frame.

This driver was made possible thanks to the long-standing effort
carried out by the linux-sunxi community in the interest of reverse
engineering, documenting and implementing support for the Allwinner VPU.
