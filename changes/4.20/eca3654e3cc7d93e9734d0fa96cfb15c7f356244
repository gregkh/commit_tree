vfs: enable remap callers that can handle short operations

Plumb in a remap flag that enables the filesystem remap handler to
shorten remapping requests for callers that can handle it.  Now
copy_file_range can report partial success (in case we run up against
alignment problems, resource limits, etc.).

We also enable CAN_SHORTEN for fideduperange to maintain existing
userspace-visible behavior where xfs/btrfs shorten the dedupe range to
avoid stale post-eof data exposure.
