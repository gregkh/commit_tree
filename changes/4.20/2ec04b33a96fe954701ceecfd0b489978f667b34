drm: Update todo.rst

- drmP.h is now fully split up.
- vkms is happening (and will gain its own todo and docs under a new
  vkms.rst file real soon)
- legacy cruft is completely hidden now, drm_vblank.c is split out
  from drm_irq.c now. I've decided to drop the task to split out
  drm_legacy.ko, partially because Dave already rejected a patch to
  hide the old dri1 drivers better. Current state feels good enough to
  me.
- best_encoder atomic cleanup is done (it's now the default, not even
  exported anymore)
- bunch of smaller things

v2:
- Explain why the drm_legacy.ko task is dropped (Emil).
- typos (Sam).

v3: Fix typo (Ilia)
