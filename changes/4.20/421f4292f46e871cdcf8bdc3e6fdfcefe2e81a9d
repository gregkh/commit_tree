bpf, tls: add tls header to tools infrastructure

Andrey reported a build error for the BPF kselftest suite when compiled on
a machine which does not have tls related header bits installed natively:

  test_sockmap.c:120:23: fatal error: linux/tls.h: No such file or directory
   #include <linux/tls.h>
                         ^
  compilation terminated.

Fix it by adding the header to the tools include infrastructure and add
definitions such as SOL_TLS that could potentially be missing.
