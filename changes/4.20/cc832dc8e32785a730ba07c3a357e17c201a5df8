dmaengine: stm32-dma: check whether length is aligned on FIFO threshold

When a period length is not multiple of FIFO some data may be stuck
within FIFO.

Burst/FIFO Threshold/Period or buffer length check has to be hardened

In any case DMA will grant any request from client but will degraded
any parameters whether awkward.
