drm: fix drm_mode_addfb() on big endian machines.

Userspace on big endian machhines typically expects the ADDFB ioctl
returns a big endian framebuffer.  drm_mode_addfb() will call
drm_mode_addfb2() unconditionally with little endian DRM_FORMAT_*
values though, which is wrong.  This patch fixes that.

Drivers (both kernel and xorg) have quirks in place to deal with the
broken drm_mode_addfb() behavior.  Because of this we can't just change
drm_mode_addfb() behavior for everybody without breaking things.  Add
the quirk_addfb_prefer_host_byte_order field to mode_config, so drivers
can opt-in.
