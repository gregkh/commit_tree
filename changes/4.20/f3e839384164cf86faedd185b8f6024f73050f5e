x86/vdso: Replace the clockid switch case

Now that the time getter functions use the clockid as index into the
storage array for the base time access, the switch case can be replaced.

- Check for clockid >= MAX_CLOCKS and for negative clockid (CPU/FD) first
  and call the fallback function right away.

- After establishing that clockid is < MAX_CLOCKS, convert the clockid to a
  bitmask

- Check for the supported high resolution and coarse functions by anding
  the bitmask of supported clocks and check whether a bit is set.

This completely avoids jump tables, reduces the number of conditionals and
makes the VDSO extensible for other clock ids.
