parisc: Include compressed vmlinux file in vmlinuz boot kernel

Change the parisc vmlinuz boot code to include and process the real
compressed vmlinux.gz ELF file instead of a compressed memory dump.
This brings parisc in sync on how it's done on x86_64.

The benefit of this change is that, e.g. for debugging purposes, one can
then extract the vmlinux file out of the vmlinuz which was booted which
wasn't possible before. This can be archieved with the existing
scripts/extract-vmlinux script, which just needs a small tweak to prefer
to extract a compressed file before trying the existing given binary.

The downside of this approach is that due to the extra round of
decompression/ELF processing we need more physical memory installed to
be able to boot a kernel.
