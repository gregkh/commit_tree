media: vb2: store userspace data in vb2_v4l2_buffer

The userspace-provided plane data needs to be stored in
vb2_v4l2_buffer. Currently this information is applied by
__fill_vb2_buffer() which is called by the core prepare_buf
and qbuf functions, but when using requests these functions
aren't called yet since the buffer won't be prepared until
the media request is actually queued.

In the meantime this information has to be stored somewhere
and vb2_v4l2_buffer is a good place for it.

The __fill_vb2_buffer callback now just copies the relevant
information from vb2_v4l2_buffer into the planes array.
