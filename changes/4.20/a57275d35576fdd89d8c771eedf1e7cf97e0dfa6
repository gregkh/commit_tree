net: hns: Avoid net reset caused by pause frames storm

There will be a large number of MAC pause frames on the net,
which caused tx timeout of net device. And then the net device
was reset to try to recover it. So that is not useful, and will
cause some other problems.

So need doubled ndev->watchdog_timeo if device watchdog occurred
until watchdog_timeo up to 40s and then try resetting to recover
it.

When collecting dfx information such as hardware registers when tx timeout.
Some registers for count were cleared when read. So need move this task
before update net state which also read the count registers.
