drm/rockchip: Convert drm_atomic_helper_suspend/resume()

convert drm_atomic_helper_suspend/resume() to use
drm_mode_config_helper_suspend/resume().

With this conversion, rockchip_drm_fb_resume() and
rockchip_drm_fb_suspend() will not be used anymore.
Both of these functions can be removed.

Also, in struct rockchip_drm_private state will not be
used anymore. So this can be removed forever.
