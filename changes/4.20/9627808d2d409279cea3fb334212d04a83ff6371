printk: keep kernel cont support always enabled

Since commit 5c2992ee7fd8a29 ("printk: remove console flushing special
cases for partial buffered lines") we don't print cont fragments
to the consoles; cont lines are now proper log_buf entries and
there is no "consecutive continuation flag" anymore: we either
have 'c' entries that mark continuation lines without fragments;
or '-' entries that mark normal logbuf entries. There are no '+'
entries anymore.

However, we still have a small leftover - presence of ext_console
drivers disables kernel cont support and we flush each pr_cont()
and store it as a separate log_buf entry. Previously, it worked
because msg_print_ext_header() had that "an optional external merge
of the records" functionality:

	if (msg->flags & LOG_CONT)
		cont = (prev_flags & LOG_CONT) ? '+' : 'c';

We don't do this as of now, so keep kernel cont always enabled.

Note from pmladek:

The original purpose was to get full information including
the metadata and dictionary via extended console drivers,
see commit 6fe29354befe4c46e ("printk: implement support
for extended console drivers").

The dictionary probably was the most important part but
it was actually lost:

  static void cont_flush(void)
  {
  [...]
	log_store(cont.facility, cont.level, cont.flags, cont.ts_nsec,
		  NULL, 0, cont.buf, cont.len);

Nobody noticed because the only dictionary user is dev_printk()
and dev_cont() is _not_ defined.
