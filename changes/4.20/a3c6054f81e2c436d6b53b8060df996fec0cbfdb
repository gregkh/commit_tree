selftests/bpf: add verifier per-cpu cgroup storage tests

This commits adds verifier tests covering per-cpu cgroup storage
functionality. There are 6 new tests, which are exactly the same
as for shared cgroup storage, but do use per-cpu cgroup storage
map.

Expected output:
  $ ./test_verifier
  #0/u add+sub+mul OK
  #0/p add+sub+mul OK
  ...
  #286/p invalid cgroup storage access 6 OK
  #287/p valid per-cpu cgroup storage access OK
  #288/p invalid per-cpu cgroup storage access 1 OK
  #289/p invalid per-cpu cgroup storage access 2 OK
  #290/p invalid per-cpu cgroup storage access 3 OK
  #291/p invalid per-cpu cgroup storage access 4 OK
  #292/p invalid per-cpu cgroup storage access 5 OK
  #293/p invalid per-cpu cgroup storage access 6 OK
  #294/p multiple registers share map_lookup_elem result OK
  ...
  #662/p mov64 src == dst OK
  #663/p mov64 src != dst OK
  Summary: 914 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED
