stm class: Add MIPI SyS-T protocol support

This adds support for MIPI SyS-T protocol as specified in an open
standard [1]. In addition to marking message boundaries, it also
supports tagging messages with the source UUID, to provide better
distinction between trace sources, including payload length and
timestamp in the message's metadata.

This driver adds attributes to STP policy nodes to control/configure
these metadata features.
