mm: split SWP_FILE into SWP_ACTIVATED and SWP_FS

The SWP_FILE flag serves two purposes: to make swap_{read,write}page() go
through the filesystem, and to make swapoff() call ->swap_deactivate().
For Btrfs, we want the latter but not the former, so split this flag into
two.  This makes us always call ->swap_deactivate() if ->swap_activate()
succeeded, not just if it didn't add any swap extents itself.

This also resolves the issue of the very misleading name of SWP_FILE,
which is only used for swap files over NFS.
