arm64/mm: use fixmap to modify swapper_pg_dir

Once swapper_pg_dir is in the rodata section, it will not be possible to
modify it directly, but we will need to modify it in some cases.

To enable this, we can use the fixmap when deliberately modifying
swapper_pg_dir. As the pgd is only transiently mapped, this provides
some resilience against illicit modification of the pgd, e.g. for
Kernel Space Mirror Attack (KSMA).
