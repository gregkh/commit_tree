PCI/AER: Remove pci_cleanup_aer_uncorrect_error_status() calls

After bfcb79fca19d ("PCI/ERR: Run error recovery callbacks for all affected
devices"), AER errors are always cleared by the PCI core and drivers don't
need to do it themselves.

Remove calls to pci_cleanup_aer_uncorrect_error_status() from device
driver error recovery functions.
