perf tools: Free temporary 'sys' string in read_event_files()

For each system in a given pevent, read_event_files() reads in a
temporary 'sys' string.  Be sure to free this string before moving onto
to the next system and/or leaving read_event_files().

Fixes the following coverity complaints:

  Error: RESOURCE_LEAK (CWE-772):

  tools/perf/util/trace-event-read.c:343: overwrite_var: Overwriting
  "sys" in "sys = read_string()" leaks the storage that "sys" points to.

  tools/perf/util/trace-event-read.c:353: leaked_storage: Variable "sys"
  going out of scope leaks the storage it points to.
