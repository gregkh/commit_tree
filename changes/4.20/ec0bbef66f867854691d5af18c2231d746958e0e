Compiler Attributes: homogenize __must_be_array

Different definitions of __must_be_array:

  * gcc: disabled for __CHECKER__

  * clang: same definition as gcc's, but without __CHECKER__

  * intel: the comment claims __builtin_types_compatible_p()
    is unsupported; but icc seems to support it since 13.0.1
    (released in 2012). See https://godbolt.org/z/S0l6QQ

Therefore, we can remove all of them and have a single definition
in compiler.h
