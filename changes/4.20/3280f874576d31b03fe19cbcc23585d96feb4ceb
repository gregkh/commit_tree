btrfs: remove btrfs_dev_replace::read_locks

This member seems to be copied from the extent_buffer locking scheme and
is at least used to assert that the read lock/unlock is properly nested.
In some way. While the _inc/_dec are called inside the read lock
section, the asserts are both inside and outside, so the ordering is not
guaranteed and we can see read/inc/dec ordered in any way
(theoretically).

A missing call of btrfs_dev_replace_clear_lock_blocking could cause
unexpected read_locks count, so this at least looks like a valid
assertion, but this will become unnecessary with later updates.
