Revert "mm, mmu_notifier: annotate mmu notifiers with blockable invalidate callbacks"

Revert 5ff7091f5a2ca ("mm, mmu_notifier: annotate mmu notifiers with
blockable invalidate callbacks").

MMU_INVALIDATE_DOES_NOT_BLOCK flags was the only one used and it is no
longer needed since 93065ac753e4 ("mm, oom: distinguish blockable mode for
mmu notifiers").  We now have a full support for per range !blocking
behavior so we can drop the stop gap workaround which the per notifier
flag was used for.
