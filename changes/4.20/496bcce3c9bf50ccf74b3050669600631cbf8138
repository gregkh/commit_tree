drm/i915: Remove unnecessary ggtt_offset_bias from i915_gem_context

Since ggtt_offset_bias is now stored in ggtt.pin_bias, it is duplicated
inside i915_gem_context, and can instead be accessed directly from ggtt.

v3:
Added a helper function to retrieve the ggtt.pin_bias from the vma.

v4:
Moved the helper function to the previous patch in the series.
Dropped the bias from intel_ring_pin. This introduces a slight functional
change since we are always pinning the ring a bit higher if GuC is present
even though we don't really need to.

v8:
Fixed patch not applying on the most recent upstream.
