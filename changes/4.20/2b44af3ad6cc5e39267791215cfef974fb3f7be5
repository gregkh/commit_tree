mtd: rawnand: ams-delta: Use private structure

Introduce a driver private structure and allocate it on device probe.
Use it for storing nand_chip structure, GPIO descriptors prevoiusly
stored in static variables as well as io_base pointer previously passed
as nand controller data or platform driver data.  Subsequent patches
may populate the structure with more members as needed.
