ext4: propagate error from dquot_initialize() in EXT4_IOC_FSSETXATTR

We return most failure of dquota_initialize() except
inode evict, this could make a bit sense, for example
we allow file removal even quota files are broken?

But it dosen't make sense to allow setting project
if quota files etc are broken.
