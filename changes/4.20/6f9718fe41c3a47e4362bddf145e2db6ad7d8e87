ceph: make 'nocopyfrom' a default mount option

Since we found a problem with the 'copy-from' operation after objects have
been truncated, offloading object copies to OSDs should be discouraged
until the issue is fixed.

Thus, this patch adds the 'nocopyfrom' mount option to the default mount
options which effectily means that remote copies won't be done in
copy_file_range unless they are explicitly enabled at mount time.

[ Adjust ceph_show_options() accordingly. ]
