9p/rdma: do not disconnect on down_interruptible EAGAIN

9p/rdma would sometimes drop the connection and display errors in
recv_done when the user does ^C.
The errors were caused by recv buffers that were posted at the time
of disconnect, and we just do not want to disconnect when
down_interruptible is... interrupted.
