kdump, proc/vmcore: Enable kdumping encrypted memory with SME enabled

In the kdump kernel, the memory of the first kernel needs to be dumped
into the vmcore file.

If SME is enabled in the first kernel, the old memory has to be remapped
with the memory encryption mask in order to access it properly.

Split copy_oldmem_page() functionality to handle encrypted memory
properly.
