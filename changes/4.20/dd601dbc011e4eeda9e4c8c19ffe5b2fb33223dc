clk: meson: clk-pll: drop hard-coded rates from pll tables

Putting hard-coded rates inside the parameter tables assumes that
the parent is known and will never change. That's a big assumption
we should not make.

We have everything we need to recalculate the output rate using
the parent rate and the rest of the parameters. Let's do so and
drop the rates from the tables.
