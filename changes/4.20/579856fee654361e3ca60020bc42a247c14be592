media: dvb-frontends/cxd2099: fix MODULE_LICENSE to 'GPL v2'

In commit 3db30defab4b ("use correct MODULE_LINCESE for GPL v2 only
according to notice in header") in the upstream repository for the
mentioned driver at https://github.com/DigitalDevices/dddvb.git, the
MODULE_LICENSE was fixed to "GPL v2" and is now in sync with the GPL
copyright boilerplate. Apply this change to the kernel tree driver
as well.
