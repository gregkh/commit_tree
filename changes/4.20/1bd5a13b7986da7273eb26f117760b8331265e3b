drm/msm/dpu: Remove unneeded checks in dpu_plane.c

Removes some checks from dpu_plane.c that will never result in an error.
Subsequent variable assignments become part of the initialization wherever
possible. Unused variables are removed.

v3: removed additional impossible checks and called helper function
_dpu_plane_get_kms() where possible.
