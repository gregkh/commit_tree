USB: Wait for extra delay time after USB_PORT_FEAT_RESET for quirky hub

Devices connected under Terminus Technology Inc. Hub (1a40:0101) may
fail to work after the system resumes from suspend:
[  206.063325] usb 3-2.4: reset full-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd
[  206.143691] usb 3-2.4: device descriptor read/64, error -32
[  206.351671] usb 3-2.4: device descriptor read/64, error -32

Info for this hub:
T:  Bus=03 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=480 MxCh= 4
D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=1a40 ProdID=0101 Rev=01.11
S:  Product=USB 2.0 Hub
C:  #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=100mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=hub

Some expirements indicate that the USB devices connected to the hub are
innocent, it's the hub itself is to blame. The hub needs extra delay
time after it resets its port.

Hence wait for extra delay, if the device is connected to this quirky
hub.
