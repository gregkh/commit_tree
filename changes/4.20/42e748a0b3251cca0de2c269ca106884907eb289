ALSA: memalloc: Add non-cached buffer type

In some cases (mainly for x86), we need the DMA coherent buffer with
non-cached pages.  Although this has been done in each driver side
like HD-audio and intel8x0, it can be done cleaner in the core memory
allocator.

This patch adds the new types, SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC and
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC_SG, for allocating such non-cached buffer
pages.  On non-x86 architectures, they work as same as the standard
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV and *_SG.

One additional change by this move is that we can assure to pass the
non-cached pgprot to the vmapped buffer, too.  It eventually fixes the
case like non-snoop mode without mmap access on HD-audio.
