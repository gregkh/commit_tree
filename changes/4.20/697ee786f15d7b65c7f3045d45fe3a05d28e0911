thermal: rcar_thermal: Prevent doing work after unbind

When testing bind/unbind on r8a7791/koelsch:

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 697 at lib/debugobjects.c:329 debug_print_object+0x8c/0xb4
    ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object type: timer_list hint: delayed_work_timer_fn+0x0/0x10

This happens if the workqueue runs after the device has been unbound.
Fix this by cancelling any queued work during remove.
