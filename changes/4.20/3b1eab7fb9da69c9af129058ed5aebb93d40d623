s390: vfio-ap: sysfs interfaces to configure control domains

Provides the sysfs interfaces for:

1. Assigning AP control domains to the mediated matrix device

2. Unassigning AP control domains from a mediated matrix device

3. Displaying the control domains assigned to a mediated matrix
   device

The IDs of the AP control domains assigned to the mediated matrix
device are stored in an AP domain mask (ADM). The bits in the ADM,
from most significant to least significant bit, correspond to
AP domain numbers 0 to 255. On some systems, the maximum allowable
domain number may be less than 255 - depending upon the host's
AP configuration - and assignment may be rejected if the input
domain ID exceeds the limit.

When a control domain is assigned, the bit corresponding its domain
ID will be set in the ADM. Likewise, when a domain is unassigned,
the bit corresponding to its domain ID will be cleared in the ADM.

The relevant sysfs structures are:

/sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/
...... [mdev_supported_types]
......... [vfio_ap-passthrough]
............ [devices]
...............[$uuid]
.................. assign_control_domain
.................. unassign_control_domain

To assign a control domain to the $uuid mediated matrix device's
ADM, write its domain number to the assign_control_domain file.
To unassign a domain, write its domain number to the
unassign_control_domain file. The domain number is specified
using conventional semantics: If it begins with 0x the number
will be parsed as a hexadecimal (case insensitive) number;
if it begins with 0, it is parsed as an octal number;
otherwise, it will be parsed as a decimal number.

For example, to assign control domain 173 (0xad) to the mediated
matrix device $uuid:

	echo 173 > assign_control_domain

	or

	echo 0255 > assign_control_domain

	or

	echo 0xad > assign_control_domain

To unassign control domain 173 (0xad):

	echo 173 > unassign_control_domain

	or

	echo 0255 > unassign_control_domain

	or

	echo 0xad > unassign_control_domain

The assignment will be rejected if the APQI exceeds the maximum
value for an AP domain:
  * If the AP Extended Addressing (APXA) facility is installed,
    the max value is 255
  * Else the max value is 15
