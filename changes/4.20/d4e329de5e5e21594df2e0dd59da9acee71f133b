btrfs: iterate all devices during trim, instead of fs_devices::alloc_list

btrfs_trim_fs iterates over the fs_devices->alloc_list while holding the
device_list_mutex.  The problem is that ->alloc_list is protected by the
chunk mutex.  We don't want to hold the chunk mutex over the trim of the
entire file system.  Fortunately, the ->dev_list list is protected by
the dev_list mutex and while it will give us all devices, including
read-only devices, we already just skip the read-only devices.  Then we
can continue to take and release the chunk mutex while scanning each
device.
