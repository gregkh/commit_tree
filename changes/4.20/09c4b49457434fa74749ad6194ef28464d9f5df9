drm/virtio: fix bounds check in virtio_gpu_cmd_get_capset()

This doesn't affect runtime because in the current code "idx" is always
valid.

First, we read from "vgdev->capsets[idx].max_size" before checking
whether "idx" is within bounds.  And secondly the bounds check is off by
one so we could end up reading one element beyond the end of the
vgdev->capsets[] array.
