arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Add display pipeline

Allwinner A64 have a display pipeline with 2 mixers/TCONs, the first
TCON is connected to LCD and the second is to HDMI.

The HDMI controller/PHY pair is similar to the one on H3/H5.

Add all required device tree nodes of the display pipeline, including
the TCON0 LCD one and the TCON1 HDMI one.
