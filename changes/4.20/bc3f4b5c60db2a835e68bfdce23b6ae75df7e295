platform/chrome: chromeos_tbmc - Remove unneeded const

Clang warns:

drivers/platform/chrome/chromeos_tbmc.c:102:14: warning: duplicate
'const' declaration specifier [-Wduplicate-decl-specifier]
static const SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS(chromeos_tbmc_pm_ops, NULL,

                                                       ^

SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS is already declared as const, this one is unnecessary
so remove it.
