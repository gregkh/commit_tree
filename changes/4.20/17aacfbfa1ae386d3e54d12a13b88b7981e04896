s390/sclp: move sclp_early_read_info to sclp_early_core.c

To enable early online memory detection sclp_early_read_info has
been moved to sclp_early_core.c. sclp_info_sccb has been made a part
of .boot.data, which allows to reuse it later during early kernel
startup and make sclp_early_read_info call just once.
