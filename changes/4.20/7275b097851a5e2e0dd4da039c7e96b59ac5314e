linux/bitmap.h: handle constant zero-size bitmaps correctly

The static inlines in bitmap.h do not handle a compile-time constant
nbits==0 correctly (they dereference the passed src or dst pointers,
despite only 0 words being valid to access).  I had the 0-day buildbot
chew on a patch [1] that would cause build failures for such cases without
complaining, suggesting that we don't have any such users currently, at
least for the 70 .config/arch combinations that was built.  Should any
turn up, make sure they use the out-of-line versions, which do handle
nbits==0 correctly.

This is of course not the most efficient, but it's much less churn than
teaching all the static inlines an "if (zero_const_nbits())", and since we
don't have any current instances, this doesn't affect existing code at
all.
