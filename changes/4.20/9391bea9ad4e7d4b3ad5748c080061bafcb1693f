staging:rtl8192u: Remove macro eqMacAddr - Style

The macro eqMacAddr implements the same functionality as the
ether_addr_equal function defined in etherdevice.h, as a result the
macro has been removed from the code, and its use replaced with the
function call.

Note that to use the ether_addr_equal function the data array
containing the MAC Address has to be u16 aligned. Because of this the
struct rt_dot11d_info has had it's member variables re-ordered.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
