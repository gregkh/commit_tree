media: vb2: skip request checks for VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF

VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF should ignore V4L2_BUF_FLAG_REQUEST_FD since it isn't
doing anything with requests. So inform vb2_queue_or_prepare_buf whether
it is called from vb2_prepare_buf or vb2_qbuf and just return 0 in the
first case.

This was found when adding new v4l2-compliance checks.
