drm/amd/display: HDR dynamic meta should be treated as stream update

[Why]
Recently we fixed HDR static meta using AFMT registers to be treated as
fast stream update.
Dynamic meta is still being treated as (full) surface update because it
touches HUBP and it travels with pipe data.
Here we change it to be (fast) stream update.
Note, originally we also wanted to redesign here a bit, but without OS
level support for true dynamic meta, it's left the same. We are simply
using HW that can do dynamic meta to send HDR static meta, I still prefer
keeping it in one static meta type then defining dynamic meta types to
hold the same info. Once we know how OS interfaces look like, we can
do proper design.

[How]
Move dyn meta update from update_hubp_dpp to commit_planes_do_stream_update
