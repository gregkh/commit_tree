asm-generic/tlb: Track which levels of the page tables have been cleared

It is common for architectures with hugepage support to require only a
single TLB invalidation operation per hugepage during unmap(), rather than
iterating through the mapping at a PAGE_SIZE increment. Currently,
however, the level in the page table where the unmap() operation occurs
is not stored in the mmu_gather structure, therefore forcing
architectures to issue additional TLB invalidation operations or to give
up and over-invalidate by e.g. invalidating the entire TLB.

Ideally, we could add an interval rbtree to the mmu_gather structure,
which would allow us to associate the correct mapping granule with the
various sub-mappings within the range being invalidated. However, this
is costly in terms of book-keeping and memory management, so instead we
approximate by keeping track of the page table levels that are cleared
and provide a means to query the smallest granule required for invalidation.
