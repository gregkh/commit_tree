s390/kasan: reipl and kexec support

Some functions from both arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c and
arch/s390/kernel/machine_kexec.c are called without DAT enabled
(or with and without DAT enabled code paths). There is no easy way
to partially disable kasan for those files without a substantial
rework. Disable kasan for both files for now.

To avoid disabling kasan for arch/s390/kernel/diag.c DAT flag is
enabled in diag308 call. pcpu_delegate which disables DAT is marked
with __no_sanitize_address to disable instrumentation for that one
function.
