net: always initialize pagedlen

In ip packet generation, pagedlen is initialized for each skb at the
start of the loop in __ip(6)_append_data, before label alloc_new_skb.

Depending on compiler options, code can be generated that jumps to
this label, triggering use of an an uninitialized variable.

In practice, at -O2, the generated code moves the initialization below
the label. But the code should not rely on that for correctness.
