PM / Domains: Don't treat zero found compatible idle states as an error

Instead of returning -EINVAL from of_genpd_parse_idle_states() in case none
compatible states was found, let's return 0 to indicate success. Assign
also the out-parameter *states to NULL and *n to 0, to indicate to the
caller that zero states have been found/allocated.

This enables the caller of of_genpd_parse_idle_states() to easier act on
the returned error code.
