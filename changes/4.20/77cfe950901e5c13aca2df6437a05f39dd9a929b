arm64/numa: Report correct memblock range for the dummy node

The dummy node ID is marked into all memory ranges on the system. So the
dummy node really extends the entire memblock.memory. Hence report correct
extent information for the dummy node using memblock range helper functions
instead of the range [0LLU, PFN_PHYS(max_pfn) - 1)].
