KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Move interrupt delivery on guest entry to C code

This is based on a patch by Suraj Jitindar Singh.

This moves the code in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S that generates an
external, decrementer or privileged doorbell interrupt just before
entering the guest to C code in book3s_hv_builtin.c.  This is to
make future maintenance and modification easier.  The algorithm
expressed in the C code is almost identical to the previous
algorithm.
