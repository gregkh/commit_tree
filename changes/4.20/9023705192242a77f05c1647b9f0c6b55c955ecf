Input: xen-kbdfront - mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in this particular case, I placed the "fall through"
part at the beginning of the code comment, which is what GCC is
expecting to find.
