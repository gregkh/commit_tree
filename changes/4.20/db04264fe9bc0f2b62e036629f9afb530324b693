vfio/pci: Mask buggy SR-IOV VF INTx support

The SR-IOV spec requires that VFs must report zero for the INTx pin
register as VFs are precluded from INTx support.  It's much easier for
the host kernel to understand whether a device is a VF and therefore
whether a non-zero pin register value is bogus than it is to do the
same in userspace.  Override the INTx count for such devices and
virtualize the pin register to provide a consistent view of the device
to the user.

As this is clearly a spec violation, warn about it to support hardware
validation, but also provide a known whitelist as it doesn't do much
good to continue complaining if the hardware vendor doesn't plan to
fix it.

Known devices with this issue: 8086:270c
