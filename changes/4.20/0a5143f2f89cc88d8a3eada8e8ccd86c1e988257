afs: Implement VL server rotation

Track VL servers as independent entities rather than lumping all their
addresses together into one set and implement server-level rotation by:

 (1) Add the concept of a VL server list, where each server has its own
     separate address list.  This code is similar to the FS server list.

 (2) Use the DNS resolver to retrieve a set of servers and their associated
     addresses, ports, preference and weight ratings.

 (3) In the case of a legacy DNS resolver or an address list given directly
     through /proc/net/afs/cells, create a list containing just a dummy
     server record and attach all the addresses to that.

 (4) Implement a simple rotation policy, for the moment ignoring the
     priorities and weights assigned to the servers.

 (5) Show the address list through /proc/net/afs/<cell>/vlservers.  This
     also displays the source and status of the data as indicated by the
     upcall.
