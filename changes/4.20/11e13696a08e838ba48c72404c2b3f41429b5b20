sched/completions/Documentation: Add recommendation for dynamic and ONSTACK completions

To prevent dynamic completion objects from being de-allocated while still
in use, add a recommendation to embed them in long lived data structures.

Also add a note for the on-stack case that emphasizes the dangers of
the limited scope, and recommends dynamic allocation if scope limitations
are not clearly understood.

[ mingo: Minor touch-ups of the text, expanded it a bit to make the
         warnings Nicholas added more prominent. ]
