vfs: allow dedupe of user owned read-only files

The permission check in vfs_dedupe_file_range_one() is too coarse - We only
allow dedupe of the destination file if the user is root, or they have the
file open for write.

This effectively limits a non-root user from deduping their own read-only
files. In addition, the write file descriptor that the user is forced to
hold open can prevent execution of files. As file data during a dedupe
does not change, the behavior is unexpected and this has caused a number of
issue reports. For an example, see:

https://github.com/markfasheh/duperemove/issues/129

So change the check so we allow dedupe on the target if:

- the root or admin is asking for it
- the process has write access
- the owner of the file is asking for the dedupe
- the process could get write access

That way users can open read-only and still get dedupe.
