btrfs: relocation: Remove redundant tree level check

Commit 581c1760415c ("btrfs: Validate child tree block's level and first
key") has made tree block level check mandatory.

So if tree block level doesn't match, we won't get a valid extent
buffer.  The extra WARN_ON() check can be removed completely.
