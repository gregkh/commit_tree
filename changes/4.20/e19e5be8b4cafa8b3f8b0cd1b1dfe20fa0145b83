s390/qeth: sanitize strings in debug messages

As Documentation/s390/s390dbf.txt states quite clearly, using any
pointer in sprinf-formatted s390dbf debug entries is dangerous.
The pointers are dereferenced whenever the trace file is read from.
So if the referenced data has a shorter life-time than the trace file,
any read operation can result in a use-after-free.

So rip out all hazardous use of indirect data, and replace any usage of
dev_name() and such by the Bus ID number.
