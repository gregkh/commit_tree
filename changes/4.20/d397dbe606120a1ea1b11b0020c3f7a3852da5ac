net: bcmgenet: fix OF child-node lookup

Use the new of_get_compatible_child() helper to lookup the mdio child
node instead of using of_find_compatible_node(), which searches the
entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
(i.e. non-child) node.

This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the node of the device being probed).
