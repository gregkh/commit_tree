xen: drop writing error messages to xenstore

xenbus_va_dev_error() will try to write error messages to Xenstore
under the error/<dev-name>/error node (with <dev-name> something like
"device/vbd/51872"). This will fail normally and another message
about this failure is added to dmesg.

I believe this is a remnant from very ancient times, as it was added
in the first pvops rush of commits in 2007.

So remove the additional message when writing to Xenstore failed as
a minimum step.
