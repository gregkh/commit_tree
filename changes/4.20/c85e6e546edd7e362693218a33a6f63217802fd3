drm/amd/display: Create new i2c resource

[Why]
I2C code did not match dc resource model and was generally
unpleasant

[How]
Move code into new svelte dce_i2c files, replacing various i2c
objects with two structs: dce_i2c_sw and dce_i2c_hw.  Fully split
sw and hw code paths.  Remove all redundant declarations.  Use
address lists to distinguish between versions.  Change dce80 code
to newer register access macros.
