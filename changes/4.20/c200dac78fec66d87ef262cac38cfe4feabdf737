x86/mm: Do not warn about PCI BIOS W+X mappings

PCI BIOS requires the BIOS area 0x0A0000-0x0FFFFFF to be mapped W+X for
various legacy reasons. When CONFIG_DEBUG_WX is enabled, this triggers the
WX warning, but this is misleading because the mapping is required and is
not a result of an accidental oversight.

Prevent the full warning when PCI BIOS is enabled and the detected WX
mapping is in the BIOS area. Just emit a pr_warn() which denotes the
fact. This is partially duplicating the info which the PCI BIOS code emits
when it maps the area as executable, but that info is not in the context of
the WX checking output.

Remove the extra %p printout in the WARN_ONCE() while at it. %pS is enough.
