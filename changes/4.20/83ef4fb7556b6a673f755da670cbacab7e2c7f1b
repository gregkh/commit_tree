dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Further residue status fix

Func jz4780_dma_desc_residue() expects the index to the next hw
descriptor as its last parameter. Caller func jz4780_dma_tx_status(),
however, applied modulus before passing it. When the current hw
descriptor was last in the list, the index passed became zero.

The resulting excess of reported residue especially caused problems
with cyclic DMA transfer clients, i.e. ALSA AIC audio output, which
rely on this for determining current DMA location within buffer.

Combined with the recent and related residue-reporting fixes, spurious
ALSA audio underruns on jz4770 hardware are now fixed.
