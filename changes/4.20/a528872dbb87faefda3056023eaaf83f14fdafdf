clk: sunxi-ng: a83t: Add max. rate constraint to video PLLs

It may happen that clock framework finds optimal video PLL rate above
that which is really supported by HW.

User manual doesn't really say what is upper limit for video PLLs on
A83T. Because of that, use the maximum rate defined in BSP clk driver
which is 3 GHz.
