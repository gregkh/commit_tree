media: dvb-frontends/mxl5xx: cleanup and fix licensing boilerplates

mxl5xx.h doesn't carry any licensing boilerplate at all right now, so copy
the boilerplate over from the main driver file mxl5xx.c. Also, mxl5xx_defs
is missing a part of the licensing boilerplate text, so add it.

[mchehab@kernel.org: kept only the part of this patch that copied
 the license from mxl5xx.c into mxl5xx.h]
