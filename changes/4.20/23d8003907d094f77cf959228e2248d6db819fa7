drm/dp_mst: Check if primary mstb is null

Unfortunately drm_dp_get_mst_branch_device which is called from both
drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep and drm_dp_mst_handle_up_rep seem to rely
on that mgr->mst_primary is not NULL, which seem to be wrong as it can be
cleared with simultaneous mode set, if probing fails or in other case.
mgr->lock mutex doesn't protect against that as it might just get
assigned to NULL right before, not simultaneously.

There are currently bugs 107738, 108616 bugs which crash in
drm_dp_get_mst_branch_device, caused by this issue.

v2: Refactored the code, as it was nicely noticed.
    Fixed Bugzilla bug numbers(second was 108616, but not 108816)
    and added links.
