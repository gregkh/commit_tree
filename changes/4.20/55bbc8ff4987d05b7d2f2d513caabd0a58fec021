selftests: pmtu: Allow selection of single tests

As number of tests is growing, it's quite convenient to allow
single tests to be run.

Display usage when the script is run with any invalid argument,
keep existing semantics when no arguments are passed so that
automated runs won't break.

Instead of just looping on the list of requested tests, if any,
check first that they exist, and go through them in a nested
loop to keep the existing way to display test descriptions.
