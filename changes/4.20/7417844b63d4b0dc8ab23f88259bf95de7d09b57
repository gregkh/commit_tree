cfg80211: Avoid regulatory restore when COUNTRY_IE_IGNORE is set

When REGULATORY_COUNTRY_IE_IGNORE is set,  __reg_process_hint_country_ie()
ignores the country code change request from __cfg80211_connect_result()
via regulatory_hint_country_ie().

After Disconnect, similar to above, country code should not be reset to
world when country IE ignore is set. But this is violated and restore of
regulatory settings is invoked by cfg80211_disconnect_work via
regulatory_hint_disconnect().

To address this, avoid regulatory restore from regulatory_hint_disconnect()
when COUNTRY_IE_IGNORE is set.

Note: Currently, restore_regulatory_settings() takes care of clearing
beacon hints. But in the proposed change, regulatory restore is avoided.
Therefore, explicitly clear beacon hints when DISABLE_BEACON_HINTS
is not set.
