xtensa: fix boot parameters address translation

The bootloader may pass physical address of the boot parameters structure
to the MMUv3 kernel in the register a2. Code in the _SetupMMU block in
the arch/xtensa/kernel/head.S is supposed to map that physical address to
the virtual address in the configured virtual memory layout.

This code haven't been updated when additional 256+256 and 512+512
memory layouts were introduced and it may produce wrong addresses when
used with these layouts.
