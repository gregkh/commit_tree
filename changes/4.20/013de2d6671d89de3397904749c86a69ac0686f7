csky: MMU and page table management

This patch adds files related to memory management and here is our
memory-layout:

   Fixmap       : 0xffc02000 – 0xfffff000       (4 MB - 12KB)
   Pkmap        : 0xff800000 – 0xffc00000       (4 MB)
   Vmalloc      : 0xf0200000 – 0xff000000       (238 MB)
   Lowmem       : 0x80000000 – 0xc0000000       (1GB)

abiv1 CPU (CK610) is VIPT cache and it doesn't support highmem.
abiv2 CPUs are all PIPT cache and they could support highmem.

Lowmem is directly mapped by msa0 & msa1 reg, and we needn't setup
memory page table for it.
