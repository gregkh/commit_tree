powerpc/pseries: Fix how we iterate over the DTL entries

When CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE is not set, we look up dtl_idx in
the lppaca to determine the number of entries in the buffer. Since
lppaca is in big endian, we need to do an endian conversion before using
this in our calculation to determine the number of entries in the
buffer. Without this, we do not iterate over the existing entries in the
DTL buffer properly.
