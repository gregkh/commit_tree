ip_gre: fix parsing gre header in ipgre_err

gre_parse_header stops parsing when csum_err is encountered, which means
tpi->key is undefined and ip_tunnel_lookup will return NULL improperly.

This patch introduce a NULL pointer as csum_err parameter. Even when
csum_err is encountered, it won't return error and continue parsing gre
header as expected.
