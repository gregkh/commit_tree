staging: mt7621-pinctrl: fix uninitialized variable ngroups

Currently the for_each_node_with_property loop us incrementing variable
ngroups however it was not initialized and hence will contain garbage.
Fix this by initializing ngroups to zero.

Detected with static analysis with cppcheck:

drivers/staging/mt7621-pinctrl/pinctrl-rt2880.c:89]: (error) Uninitialized
variable: ngroups
