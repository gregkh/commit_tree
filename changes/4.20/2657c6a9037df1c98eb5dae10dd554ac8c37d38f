ASoC: AMD: Add SND_JACK_LINEOUT jack type

Some 3 pole connectors report impedance greater than threshold of
1000Ohm. Thus, da7219 reports them as LINEOUT.
Adding the SND_JACK_LINEOUT type so that we don't fail to detect
any 3 pole jack type.
Also, changing
SND_JACK_HEADPHONE | SND_JACK_MICROPHONE -> SND_JACK_HEADSET
