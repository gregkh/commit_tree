efi: Make efi_rts_work accessible to efi page fault handler

After the kernel has booted, if any accesses by firmware causes a page
fault, the efi page fault handler would freeze efi_rts_wq and schedules
a new process. To do this, the efi page fault handler needs
efi_rts_work. Hence, make it accessible.

There will be no race conditions in accessing this structure, because
all the calls to efi runtime services are already serialized.
