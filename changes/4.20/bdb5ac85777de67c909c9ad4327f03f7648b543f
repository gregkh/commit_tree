PCI/ERR: Handle fatal error recovery

We don't need to be paranoid about the topology changing while handling an
error.  If the device has changed in a hotplug capable slot, we can rely on
the presence detection handling to react to a changing topology.

Restore the fatal error handling behavior that existed before merging DPC
with AER with 7e9084b36740 ("PCI/AER: Handle ERR_FATAL with removal and
re-enumeration of devices").
