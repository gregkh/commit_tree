phy: Revert toggling reset changes.

This reverts:

ef1b5bf506b1 ("net: phy: Fix not to call phy_resume() if PHY is not attached")
8c85f4b81296 ("net: phy: micrel: add toggling phy reset if PHY is not  attached")

Andrew Lunn informs me that there are alternative efforts
underway to fix this more properly.
