s390: unify stack size definitions

Remove STACK_ORDER and STACK_SIZE in favour of identical THREAD_SIZE_ORDER
and THREAD_SIZE definitions. THREAD_SIZE and THREAD_SIZE_ORDER naming is
misleading since it is used as general kernel stack size information. But
both those definitions are used in the common code and throughout
architectures specific code, so changing the naming is problematic.
