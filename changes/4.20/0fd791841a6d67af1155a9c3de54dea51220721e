HID: input: Ignore battery reported by Symbol DS4308

The Motorola/Zebra Symbol DS4308-HD is a handheld USB barcode scanner
which does not have a battery, but reports one anyway that always has
capacity 2.

Let's apply the IGNORE quirk to prevent it from being treated like a
power supply so that userspaces don't get confused that this
accessory is almost out of power and warn the user that they need to charge
their wired barcode scanner.
