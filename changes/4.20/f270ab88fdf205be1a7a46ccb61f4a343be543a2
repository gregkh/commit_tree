arm64: tlb: Adjust stride and type of TLBI according to mmu_gather

Now that the core mmu_gather code keeps track of both the levels of page
table cleared and also whether or not these entries correspond to
intermediate entries, we can use this in our tlb_flush() callback to
reduce the number of invalidations we issue as well as their scope.
