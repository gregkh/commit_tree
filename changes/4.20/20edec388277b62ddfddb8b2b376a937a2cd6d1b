firmware: coreboot: Unmap ioregion after device population

Both callers of coreboot_table_init() ioremap the pointer that comes in
but they don't unmap the memory on failure. Both of them also fail probe
immediately with the return value of coreboot_table_init(), leaking a
mapping when it fails. The mapping isn't necessary at all after devices
are populated either, so we can just drop the mapping here when we exit
the function. Let's do that to simplify the code a bit and plug the leak.
