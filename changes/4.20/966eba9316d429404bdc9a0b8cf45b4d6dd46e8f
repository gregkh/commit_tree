KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Remove left-over code in XICS-on-XIVE emulation

This removes code that clears the external interrupt pending bit in
the pending_exceptions bitmap.  This is left over from an earlier
iteration of the code where this bit was set when an escalation
interrupt arrived in order to wake the vcpu from cede.  Currently
we set the vcpu->arch.irq_pending flag instead for this purpose.
Therefore there is no need to do anything with the pending_exceptions
bitmap.
