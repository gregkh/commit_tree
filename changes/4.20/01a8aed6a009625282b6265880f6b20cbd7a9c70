scsi: lpfc: Fix GFT_ID and PRLI logic for RSCN

Driver only sends NVME PRLI to a device that also supports FCP.  This resuls
in remote ports that don't have fc_remote_ports created for them. The driver
is clearing the nlp_fc4_type for a ndlp at the wrong time.

Fix by moving the nlp_fc4_type clearing to the discovery engine in the
DEVICE_RECOVERY state. Also ensure that rport registration is done for all
nlp_fc4_types.
