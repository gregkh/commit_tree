regmap: split up regmap_config.use_single_rw

Split regmap_config.use_single_rw into use_single_read and
use_single_write. This change enables drivers of devices which only
support bulk operations in one direction to use the regmap_bulk_*()
functions for both directions and have their bulk operation split into
single operations only when necessary.

Update all struct regmap_config instances where use_single_rw==true to
instead set both use_single_read and use_single_write. No attempt was
made to evaluate whether it is possible to set only one of
use_single_read or use_single_write.
