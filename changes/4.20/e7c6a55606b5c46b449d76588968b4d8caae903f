hwmon: (pmbus) Fix page count auto-detection.

Devices with compatible="pmbus" field have zero initial page count,
and pmbus_clear_faults() being called before the page count auto-
detection does not actually clear faults because it depends on the
page count. Non-cleared faults in its turn may fail the subsequent
page count auto-detection.

This patch fixes this problem by calling pmbus_clear_fault_page()
for currently set page and calling pmbus_clear_faults() after the
page count was detected.
