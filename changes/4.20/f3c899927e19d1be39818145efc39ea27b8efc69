ARM: 8786/1: Debug kernel copy by printing

It may happen that when we relocate the kernel we corrupt other
sensible memory (e.g. the memory needed by U-Boot for dealing
with bootm command) while copying the kernel. If we overwrite
the content of the memory area used by U-Boot's command bootm
(described by U-Boot's parameters bootm_low and bootm_size),
the kernel won't be able to boot. Troubleshooting the problem
then is not straightforward.

This commit allows the user to easily print information on
where the kernel gets copied from/to in order to help with the
design of the system memory map (e.g. bootm_low and bootm_size)
at boot up.
