kvm: arm64: Add helper for loading the stage2 setting for a VM

We load the stage2 context of a guest for different operations,
including running the guest and tlb maintenance on behalf of the
guest. As of now only the vttbr is private to the guest, but this
is about to change with IPA per VM. Add a helper to load the stage2
configuration for a VM, which could do the right thing with the
future changes.
