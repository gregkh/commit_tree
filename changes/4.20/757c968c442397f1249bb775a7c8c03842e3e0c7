ACPI / SBS: Fix rare oops when removing modules

There was a small race when removing the sbshc module where
smbus_alarm() had queued acpi_smbus_callback() for deferred execution
but it hadn't been run yet, so that when it did run hc had been freed
and the module unloaded, resulting in an invalid paging request.

A similar race existed when removing the sbs module with regards to
acpi_sbs_callback() (which is called from acpi_smbus_callback()).

We therefore need to ensure no callbacks are pending or executing before
the cleanups are done and the modules are removed.
