IB/mlx5: Set uid as part of SQ commands

Set uid as part of SQ commands so that the firmware can manage the
SQ object in a secured way.

The uid for the destroy command is set by mlx5_core.

This will enable using an SQ that was created by verbs application
to be used by the DEVX flow in case the uid is equal.
