fbdev: Add FBINFO_HIDE_SMEM_START flag

DRM drivers really, really, really don't want random userspace to
share buffer behind it's back, bypassing the dma-buf buffer sharing
machanism. For that reason we've ruthlessly rejected any IOCTL
exposing the physical address of any graphics buffer.

Unfortunately fbdev comes with that built-in. We could just set
smem_start to 0, but that means we'd have to hand-roll our own fb_mmap
implementation. For good reasons many drivers do that, but
smem_start/length is still super convenient.

Hence instead just stop the leak in the ioctl, to keep fb mmap working
as-is. A second patch will set this flag for all drm drivers.
