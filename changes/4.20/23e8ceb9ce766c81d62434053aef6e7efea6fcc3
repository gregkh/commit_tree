cpuidle: menu: Compute first_idx when latency_req is known

Since menu_select() can only set first_idx to 1 if the exit latency
of the second state is not greater than the latency limit, it should
first determine that limit.  Thus first_idx should be computed after
the "interactivity" factor has been taken into account.
