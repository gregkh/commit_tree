irq/matrix: Fix memory overallocation

IRQ_MATRIX_SIZE is the number of longs needed for a bitmap, multiplied by
the size of a long, yielding a byte count. But it is used to size an array
of longs, which is way more memory than is needed.

Change IRQ_MATRIX_SIZE so it is just the number of longs needed and the
arrays come out the correct size.
