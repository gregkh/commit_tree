ARM: dts: imx6q-icore-mipi: Use 1.5 version of i.Core MX6

The "EDIMM STARTER KIT i.Core 1.5 MIPI Evaluation" is based on the 1.5 version
of the i.Core MX6 cpu module. The 1.5 version differs from the original one for
a few details, including the ethernet PHY interface clock provider.

With this commit, the ethernet interface works properly:
SMSC LAN8710/LAN8720 2188000.ethernet-1:00: attached PHY driver

While before using the 1.5 version, ethernet failed to startup do to un-clocked
PHY interface:
fec 2188000.ethernet eth0: could not attach to PHY
