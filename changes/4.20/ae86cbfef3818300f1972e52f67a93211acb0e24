libnvdimm, pfn: Pad pfn namespaces relative to other regions

Commit cfe30b872058 "libnvdimm, pmem: adjust for section collisions with
'System RAM'" enabled Linux to workaround occasions where platform
firmware arranges for "System RAM" and "Persistent Memory" to collide
within a single section boundary. Unfortunately, as reported in this
issue [1], platform firmware can inflict the same collision between
persistent memory regions.

The approach of interrogating iomem_resource does not work in this
case because platform firmware may merge multiple regions into a single
iomem_resource range. Instead provide a method to interrogate regions
that share the same parent bus.

This is a stop-gap until the core-MM can grow support for hotplug on
sub-section boundaries.
