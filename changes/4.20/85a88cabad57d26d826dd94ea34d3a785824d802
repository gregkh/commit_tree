powerpc/pseries: Disable CPU hotplug across migrations

When performing partition migrations all present CPUs must be online
as all present CPUs must make the H_JOIN call as part of the migration
process. Once all present CPUs make the H_JOIN call, one CPU is returned
to make the rtas call to perform the migration to the destination system.

During testing of migration and changing the SMT state we have found
instances where CPUs are offlined, as part of the SMT state change,
before they make the H_JOIN call. This results in a hung system where
every CPU is either in H_JOIN or offline.

To prevent this this patch disables CPU hotplug during the migration
process.
