ice: Refactor switch rule management structures and functions

This patch is an adaptation of the work originally done by Grishma
Kotecha <grishma.kotecha@intel.com> that in summary refactors the
switch filtering logic in the driver. More specifically,
 - Update the recipe structure to also store list of rules
 - Update the existing code for recipes like MAC, VLAN, ethtype etc to
   use list head that is attached to switch recipe structure
 - Add a common function to search for a rule entry and add a new rule
   entry. Update the code to use this new function.
 - Refactor the rem_handle_vsi_list function to simplify the logic
