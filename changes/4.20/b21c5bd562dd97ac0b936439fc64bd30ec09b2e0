signal: Remove specific_send_sig_info

This function is static and it only has two callers.  As
specific_send_sig_info is only called twice remembering what
specific_send_sig_info does when reading the code is difficutl and it
makes it hard to see which sending sending functions are equivalent to
which others.

So remove specific_send_sig_info to make the code easier to read.
