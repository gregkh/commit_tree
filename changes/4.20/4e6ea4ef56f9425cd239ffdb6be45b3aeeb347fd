srcu: Make early-boot call_srcu() reuse workqueue lists

Allocating a list_head structure that is almost never used, and, when
used, is used only during early boot (rcu_init() and earlier), is a bit
wasteful.  This commit therefore eliminates that list_head in favor of
the one in the work_struct structure.  This is safe because the work_struct
structure cannot be used until after rcu_init() returns.
