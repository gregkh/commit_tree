vhost/scsi: Respond to control queue operations

The vhost-scsi driver currently does not handle any control queue
operations. In particular, vhost_scsi_ctl_handle_kick, merely prints out
a debug message but does nothing else. This can cause guest VMs to hang.

As part of SCSI recovery from an error, e.g., an I/O timeout, the SCSI
midlayer attempts to abort the failed operation. The SCSI virtio driver
translates the abort to a SCSI TMF request that gets put on the control
queue (virtscsi_abort -> virtscsi_tmf). The SCSI virtio driver then
waits indefinitely for this request to be completed, but it never will
because vhost-scsi never responds to that request.

To avoid a hang, always respond to control queue operations; explicitly
reject TMF requests, and return a no-op response to event requests.
