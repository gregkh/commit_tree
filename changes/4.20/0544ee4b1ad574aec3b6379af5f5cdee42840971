i2c: scmi: Fix probe error on devices with an empty SMB0001 ACPI device node

Some AMD based HP laptops have a SMB0001 ACPI device node which does not
define any methods.

This leads to the following error in dmesg:

[    5.222731] cmi: probe of SMB0001:00 failed with error -5

This commit makes acpi_smbus_cmi_add() return -ENODEV instead in this case
silencing the error. In case of a failure of the i2c_add_adapter() call
this commit now propagates the error from that call instead of -EIO.
