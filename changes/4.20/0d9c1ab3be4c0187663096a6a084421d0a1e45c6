libceph: preallocate message data items

Currently message data items are allocated with ceph_msg_data_create()
in setup_request_data() inside send_request().  send_request() has never
been allowed to fail, so each allocation is followed by a BUG_ON:

  data = ceph_msg_data_create(...);
  BUG_ON(!data);

It's been this way since support for multiple message data items was
added in commit 6644ed7b7e04 ("libceph: make message data be a pointer")
in 3.10.

There is no reason to delay the allocation of message data items until
the last possible moment and we certainly don't need a linked list of
them as they are only ever appended to the end and never erased.  Make
ceph_msg_new2() take max_data_items and adapt the rest of the code.
