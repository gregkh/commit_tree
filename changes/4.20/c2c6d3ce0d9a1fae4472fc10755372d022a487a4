ceph: add destination file data sync before doing any remote copy

If we try to copy into a file that was just written, any data that is
remote copied will be overwritten by our buffered writes once they are
flushed. Â When this happens, the call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range
will also return a -EBUSY error.

This patch fixes this by also sync'ing the destination file before
starting any copy.
