f2fs: surround fault_injection related option parsing using CONFIG_F2FS_FAULT_INJECTION

It's a little bit strange when fault_injection related
options fail with -EINVAL which were already disabled
from config, so surround all fault_injection related option
parsing code using CONFIG_F2FS_FAULT_INJECTION. Meanwhile,
slightly change warning message to keep consistency with
option POSIX_ACL and FS_XATTR.
