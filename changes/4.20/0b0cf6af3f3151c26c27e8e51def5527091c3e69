crypto: hisilicon - Fix reference after free of memories on error path

coccicheck currently warns of the following issues in the driver:
drivers/crypto/hisilicon/sec/sec_algs.c:864:51-66: ERROR: reference preceded by free on line 812
drivers/crypto/hisilicon/sec/sec_algs.c:864:40-49: ERROR: reference preceded by free on line 813
drivers/crypto/hisilicon/sec/sec_algs.c:861:8-24: ERROR: reference preceded by free on line 814
drivers/crypto/hisilicon/sec/sec_algs.c:860:41-51: ERROR: reference preceded by free on line 815
drivers/crypto/hisilicon/sec/sec_algs.c:867:7-18: ERROR: reference preceded by free on line 816

It would appear than on certain error paths that we may attempt reference-
after-free some memories.

This patch fixes those issues. The solution doesn't look perfect, but
having same memories free'd possibly from separate functions makes it
tricky.
