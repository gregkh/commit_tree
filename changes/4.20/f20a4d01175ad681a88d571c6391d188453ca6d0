net: sched: act_nat: remove dependency on rtnl lock

According to the new locking rule, we have to take tcf_lock for both
->init() and ->dump(), as RTNL will be removed.

Use tcf spinlock to protect private nat action data from concurrent
modification during dump. (nat init already uses tcf spinlock when changing
action state)
