parisc: Release spinlocks using ordered store

This patch updates the spin unlock code to use an ordered store with
release semanatics.  All prior accesses are guaranteed to be performed
before an ordered store is performed.

Using an ordered store is significantly faster than using the sync
memory barrier.
