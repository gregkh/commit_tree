scsi: qla2xxx: Fix stuck session in PLOGI state

On PLOGI complete + RSCN received, driver tries to handle RSCN but failed to
reset the session back to the beginning to restart the login process. Instead
the session was left in the Plogi complete without moving forward.  This patch
will push the session state back to the delete state and restart the
connection.
