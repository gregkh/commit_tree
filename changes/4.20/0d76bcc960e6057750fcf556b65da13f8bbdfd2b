Revert "ACPI/PCI: Pay attention to device-specific _PXM node values"

This reverts commit bad7dcd94f3956bcfc0a69ef71fdf0fcca3de4a8.

bad7dcd94f39 ("ACPI/PCI: Pay attention to device-specific _PXM node
values") caused boot failures (no console output at all) for Martin [1]
and Ingo [2] on AMD ThreadRipper systems.

Revert the commit until we figure out how to safely use these
device-specific _PXM values.
