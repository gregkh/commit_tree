PCI: pciehp: Unify controller and slot structs

pciehp was originally introduced together with shpchp in a single
commit, c16b4b14d980 ("PCI Hotplug: Add SHPC and PCI Express hot-plug
drivers"):
https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/c16b4b14d980

shpchp supports up to 31 slots per controller, hence uses separate slot
and controller structs.  pciehp has a 1:1 relationship between slot and
controller and therefore never required this separation.  Nevertheless,
because much of the code had been copy-pasted between the two drivers,
pciehp likewise uses separate structs to this very day.

The artificial separation of data structures adds unnecessary complexity
and bloat to pciehp and requires constantly chasing pointers at runtime.

Simplify the driver by merging struct slot into struct controller.
Merge the slot constructor pcie_init_slot() and the destructor
pcie_cleanup_slot() into the controller counterparts.

No functional change intended.
