scsi: vmw_pscsi: Rearrange code to avoid multiple calls to free_irq during unload

Currently pvscsi_remove calls free_irq more than once as
pvscsi_release_resources and __pvscsi_shutdown both call
pvscsi_shutdown_intr. This results in a 'Trying to free already-free IRQ'
warning and stack trace. To solve the problem pvscsi_shutdown_intr has been
moved out of pvscsi_release_resources.
