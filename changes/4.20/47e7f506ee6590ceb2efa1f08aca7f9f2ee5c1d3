drm/msm: fix handling of cmdstream offset

Userspace hasn't used submit cmds with submit_offset != 0 for a while,
but this starts cropping up again with cmdstream sub-buffer-allocation
in libdrm_freedreno.

Doesn't do much good to increment the buf ptr before assigning it.

Fixes: 78b8e5b847b4 drm/msm: dump a rd GPUADDR header for all buffers in the command
