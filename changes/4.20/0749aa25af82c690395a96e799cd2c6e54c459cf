nvmem: core: fix regression in of_nvmem_cell_get()

NVMEM DT support seems to be totally broken after
commit e888d445ac33 ("nvmem: resolve cells from DT at registration time")
Fix this!

Index used in of_nvmem_cell_get() to find cell is specific to
consumer, It can not be used for searching the cell in provider.
Use device_node instead of this to find the matching cell in device
tree case.
