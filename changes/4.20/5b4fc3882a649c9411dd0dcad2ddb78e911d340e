sparc64: Make corrupted user stacks more debuggable.

Right now if we get a corrupted user stack frame we do a
do_exit(SIGILL) which is not helpful.

If under a debugger, this behavior causes the inferior process to
exit.  So the register and other state cannot be examined at the time
of the event.

Instead, conditionally log a rate limited kernel log message and then
force a SIGSEGV.

With bits and ideas borrowed (as usual) from powerpc.
