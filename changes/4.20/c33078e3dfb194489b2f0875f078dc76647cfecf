net/ipv4: Update inet_dump_ifaddr for strict data checking

Update inet_dump_ifaddr for strict data checking. If the flag is set,
the dump request is expected to have an ifaddrmsg struct as the header
potentially followed by one or more attributes. Any data passed in the
header or as an attribute is taken as a request to influence the data
returned. Only values supported by the dump handler are allowed to be
non-0 or set in the request. At the moment only the IFA_TARGET_NETNSID
attribute is supported. Follow on patches can support for other fields
(e.g., honor ifa_index and only return data for the given device index).
