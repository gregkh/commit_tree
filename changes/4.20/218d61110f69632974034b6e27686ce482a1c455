perf top: Do not use overwrite mode by default

Enabling --overwrite mode allows us to to use just the most recent
records, which helps in high core count machines such as Knights
Landing/Mill, but right now is being disabled by default as the pausing
used in this technique is leading to loss of metadata events such as
PERF_RECORD_MMAP which makes 'perf top' unable to resolve samples,
leading to lots of unknown samples appearing on the UI.

Enabling this may be useful if you are in such machines and profiling a
workload that doesn't creates short lived threads and/or doesn't uses
many executable mmap operations.

Work is being planed to solve this situation, till then, this will
remain disabled by default.
