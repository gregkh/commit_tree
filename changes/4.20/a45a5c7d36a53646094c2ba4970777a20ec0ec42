s390/pkey: Introduce new API for random protected key generation

This patch introduces a new ioctl API and in-kernel API to
generate a random protected key. The protected key is generated
in a way that the effective clear key is never exposed in clear.
Both APIs are described in detail in the header files
arch/s390/include/asm/pkey.h and arch/s390/include/uapi/asm/pkey.h.
