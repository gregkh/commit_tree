scsi: ufs: Add a bsg endpoint that supports UPIUs

For now, just provide an API to allocate and remove ufs-bsg node. We
will use this framework to manage ufs devices by sending UPIU
transactions.

For the time being, implements an empty bsg_request() - will add some
more functionality in coming patches.

Nonetheless, we reveal here the protocol we are planning to use: UFS
Transport Protocol Transactions. UFS transactions consist of packets
called UFS Protocol Information Units (UPIU).

There are UPIUâ€™s defined for UFS SCSI commands, responses, data in and
data out, task management, utility functions, vendor functions,
transaction synchronization and control, and more.

By using UPIUs, we get access to the most fine-grained internals of this
protocol, and able to communicate with the device in ways, that are
sometimes beyond the capacity of the ufs driver.

Moreover and as a result, our core structure - ufs_bsg_node has a pretty
lean structure: using upiu transactions that contains the outmost
detailed info, so we don't really need complex constructs to support it.
