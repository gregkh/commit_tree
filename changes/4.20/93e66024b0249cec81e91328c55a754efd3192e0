netfilter: conntrack: pass nf_hook_state to packet and error handlers

nf_hook_state contains all the hook meta-information: netns, protocol family,
hook location, and so on.

Instead of only passing selected information, pass a pointer to entire
structure.

This will allow to merge the error and the packet handlers and remove
the ->new() function in followup patches.
