signal/arm64: Push siginfo generation into arm64_notify_die

Instead of generating a struct siginfo before calling arm64_notify_die
pass the signal number, tne sicode and the fault address into
arm64_notify_die and have it call force_sig_fault instead of
force_sig_info to let the generic code generate the struct siginfo.

This keeps code passing just the needed information into
siginfo generating code, making it easier to see what
is happening and harder to get wrong.  Further by letting
the generic code handle the generation of struct siginfo
it reduces the number of sites generating struct siginfo
making it possible to review them and verify that all
of the fiddly details for a structure passed to userspace
are handled properly.
