mm/huge_memory: rename freeze_page() to unmap_page()

The term "freeze" is used in several ways in the kernel, and in mm it
has the particular meaning of forcing page refcount temporarily to 0.
freeze_page() is just too confusing a name for a function that unmaps a
page: rename it unmap_page(), and rename unfreeze_page() remap_page().

Went to change the mention of freeze_page() added later in mm/rmap.c,
but found it to be incorrect: ordinary page reclaim reaches there too;
but the substance of the comment still seems correct, so edit it down.
