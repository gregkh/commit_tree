ALSA: fireface: fix reference to wrong register for clock configuration

In an initial commit, 'SYNC_STATUS' register is referred to get
clock configuration, however this is wrong, according to my local
note at hand for reverse-engineering about packet dump. It should
be 'CLOCK_CONFIG' register. Actually, ff400_dump_clock_config()
is correctly programmed.

This commit fixes the bug.
