MAINTAINERS: remove non-exsiting email address of Baoyou

We keep getting bounces from Baoyou Xie <baoyou.xie@linaro.org>.  We
do not know Baoyou's new email address, nor his interest to stay as
the co-maintainer.  Let's remove the non-exsiting email first, and we
can add his new email back if we heard back from him later.
