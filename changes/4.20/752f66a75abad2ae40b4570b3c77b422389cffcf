bcache: use REQ_PRIO to indicate bio for metadata

In cached_dev_cache_miss() and check_should_bypass(), REQ_META is used
to check whether a bio is for metadata request. REQ_META is used for
blktrace, the correct REQ_ flag should be REQ_PRIO. This flag means the
bio should be prior to other bio, and frequently be used to indicate
metadata io in file system code.

This patch replaces REQ_META with correct flag REQ_PRIO.

CC Adam Manzanares because he explains to me what REQ_PRIO is for.
