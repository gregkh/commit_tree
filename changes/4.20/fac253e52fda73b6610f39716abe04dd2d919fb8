coresight: Document error handling in coresight_register

commit 6403587a930c ("coresight: use put_device() instead of kfree()")
fixes the double freeing of resources and ensures that the device
refcount is dropped properly. Add a comment to explain this to
help the readers and prevent people trying to "unfix" it again.

While at it, rename the labels for better readability.
