mm/sparse: add common helper to mark all memblocks present

Presently the arches arm64, arm and sh have a function which loops
through each memblock and calls memory present.  riscv will require a
similar function.

Introduce a common memblocks_present() function that can be used by all
the arches.  Subsequent patches will cleanup the arches that make use of
this.
