arm64: PCI: Remove node-local allocations when initialising host controller

Memory for host controller data structures is allocated local to the node
to which the controller is associated with.  This has been the behaviour
since support for ACPI was added in commit 0cb0786bac15 ("ARM64: PCI:
Support ACPI-based PCI host controller").

Drop the node local allocation as there is no benefit from doing so - the
usage of these structures is independent from where the controller is
located.
