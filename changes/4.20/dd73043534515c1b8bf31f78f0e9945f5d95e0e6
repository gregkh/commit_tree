drm/amd/display: implement DPMS DTN test v2

[why]
Existing DTN infrastructure in driver is hacky.  It uses implicit log
names, and also incorrect escape ID.

[how]
- Implement using generic DTN escape ID.
- Move file logging functionality from driver to to script; driver now outputs to string/buffer
- Move HWSS debug functionality to separate c file
- Add debug functionalty for per-block logging as CSV
- Add pretty print in python
