ata: ahci_platform: add support for PHY controller regulator

The SoC R40 AHCI controller need a PHY regulator to work.
But since the PHY is embedded in the controller, we cannot do a DT node for it,
since phy-supply works only in node with a PHY compatible.
So this patch adds a way to add an optional phy-supply regulator on AHCI controller node.
