lightnvm: pblk: fix two sleep-in-atomic-context bugs

The driver may sleep with holding a spinlock.

The function call paths (from bottom to top) in Linux-4.16 are:

[FUNC] nvm_dev_dma_alloc(GFP_KERNEL)
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-core.c, 754:
	nvm_dev_dma_alloc in pblk_line_submit_smeta_io
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-core.c, 1048:
	pblk_line_submit_smeta_io in pblk_line_init_bb
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-core.c, 1434:
	pblk_line_init_bb in pblk_line_replace_data
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-recovery.c, 980:
	pblk_line_replace_data in pblk_recov_l2p
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-recovery.c, 976:
	spin_lock in pblk_recov_l2p

[FUNC] bio_map_kern(GFP_KERNEL)
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-core.c, 762:
	bio_map_kern in pblk_line_submit_smeta_io
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-core.c, 1048:
	pblk_line_submit_smeta_io in pblk_line_init_bb
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-core.c, 1434:
	pblk_line_init_bb in pblk_line_replace_data
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-recovery.c, 980:
	pblk_line_replace_data in pblk_recov_l2p
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-recovery.c, 976:
	spin_lock in pblk_recov_l2p

To fix these bugs, the call to pblk_line_replace_data()
is moved out of the spinlock protection.

These bugs are found by my static analysis tool DSAC.
