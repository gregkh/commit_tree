drm/amd: Add PSP DMCU support

DMCU (Display Microcontroller Unit) is a GPU chip involved in
eDP features like Adaptive Backlight Modulation and Panel Self
Refresh.

PSP is already equipped to handle DMCU firmware loading, all
that is needed is to translate between the new DMCU ucode ID and
the equivalent psp_gfx_fw_type.
