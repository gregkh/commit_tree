drm/ast: Remove existing framebuffers before loading driver

If vesafb attaches to the AST device, it configures the framebuffer memory
for uncached access by default. When ast.ko later tries to attach itself to
the device, it wants to use write-combining on the framebuffer memory, but
vesefb's existing configuration for uncached access takes precedence. This
results in reduced performance.

Removing the framebuffer's configuration before loding the AST driver fixes
the problem. Other DRM drivers already contain equivalent code.
