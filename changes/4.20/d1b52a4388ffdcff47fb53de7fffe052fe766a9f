s390: introduce .boot.data section

Introduce .boot.data section which is "shared" between the decompressor
code and the decompressed kernel. The decompressor will store values in
it, and copy over to the decompressed image before starting it. This
method allows to avoid using pre-defined addresses and other hacks to
pass values between those boot phases.

.boot.data section is a part of init data, and will be freed after kernel
initialization is complete.

For uncompressed kernel image, .boot.data section is basically the same
as .init.data
