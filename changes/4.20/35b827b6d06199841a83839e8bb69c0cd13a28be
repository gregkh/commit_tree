tun: forbid iface creation with rtnl ops

It's not supported right now (the goal of the initial patch was to support
'ip link del' only).

Before the patch:
$ ip link add foo type tun
[  239.632660] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000000
[snip]
[  239.636410] RIP: 0010:register_netdevice+0x8e/0x3a0

This panic occurs because dev->netdev_ops is not set by tun_setup(). But to
have something usable, it will require more than just setting
netdev_ops.
