jump_table: Move entries into ro_after_init region

The __jump_table sections emitted into the core kernel and into
each module consist of statically initialized references into
other parts of the code, and with the exception of entries that
point into init code, which are defused at post-init time, these
data structures are never modified.

So let's move them into the ro_after_init section, to prevent them
from being corrupted inadvertently by buggy code, or deliberately
by an attacker.
