Compiler Attributes: improve explanation of header

Explain better what "optional" attributes are, and avoid calling
them so to avoid confusion. Simply retain "Optional" as a word
to look for in the comments.

Moreover, add a couple sentences to explain a bit more the intention
and the documentation links.
