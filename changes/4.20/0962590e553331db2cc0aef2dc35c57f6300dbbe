bpf: fix partial copy of map_ptr when dst is scalar

ALU operations on pointers such as scalar_reg += map_value_ptr are
handled in adjust_ptr_min_max_vals(). Problem is however that map_ptr
and range in the register state share a union, so transferring state
through dst_reg->range = ptr_reg->range is just buggy as any new
map_ptr in the dst_reg is then truncated (or null) for subsequent
checks. Fix this by adding a raw member and use it for copying state
over to dst_reg.
