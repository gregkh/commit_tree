Btrfs: fix missing delayed iputs on unmount

There's a race between close_ctree() and cleaner_kthread().
close_ctree() sets btrfs_fs_closing(), and the cleaner stops when it
sees it set, but this is racy; the cleaner might have already checked
the bit and could be cleaning stuff. In particular, if it deletes unused
block groups, it will create delayed iputs for the free space cache
inodes. As of "btrfs: don't run delayed_iputs in commit", we're no
longer running delayed iputs after a commit. Therefore, if the cleaner
creates more delayed iputs after delayed iputs are run in
btrfs_commit_super(), we will leak inodes on unmount and get a busy
inode crash from the VFS.

Fix it by parking the cleaner before we actually close anything. Then,
any remaining delayed iputs will always be handled in
btrfs_commit_super(). This also ensures that the commit in close_ctree()
is really the last commit, so we can get rid of the commit in
cleaner_kthread().

The fstest/generic/475 followed by 476 can trigger a crash that
manifests as a slab corruption caused by accessing the freed kthread
structure by a wake up function. Sample trace:
