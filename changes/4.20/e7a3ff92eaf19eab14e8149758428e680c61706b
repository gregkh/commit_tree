dmaengine: fsl-edma: add ColdFire mcf5441x edma support

This patch adds support for ColdFire mcf5441x-family edma
module.

The ColdFire edma module is slightly different from fsl-edma,
so a new driver is added. But most of the code is common
between fsl-edma and mcf-edma so it has been collected into a
separate common module fsl-edma-common (patch 1/3).
