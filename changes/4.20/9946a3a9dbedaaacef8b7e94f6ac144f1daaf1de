drm/atmel-hlcdc: allow selecting a higher pixel-clock than requested

But only if the highest pixel-clock frequency lower than requested
is significantly less accurate than the lowest frequency higher than
requested.

I pulled "10 times" as the discriminator out of the hat, and went with
that.

This is useful, if e.g. the target pixel-clock is 65MHz and the sys_clk
is 132MHz. In this case the highest possible pixel-clock lower than the
requested 65MHz is 52.8MHz, which is almost 20% off (and outside the
spec for the panel). The lowest possible pixel-clock higher than 65MHz
is 66MHz, which is a *much* better match, and only 1.5% off.
