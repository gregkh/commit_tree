octeontx2-af: NIX block admin queue init

Initialize NIX admin queue (AQ) i.e alloc memory for
AQ instructions and for the results. All NIX LFs will submit
instructions to AQ to init/write/read RQ/SQ/CQ/RSS contexts
and in case of read, get context from result memory.

Also before configuring/using NIX block calibrate X2P bus
and check if NIX interfaces like CGX and LBK are in active
and working state.
