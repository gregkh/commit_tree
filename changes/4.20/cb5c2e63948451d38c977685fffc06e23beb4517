cifs: fix a credits leak for compund commands

When processing the mids for compounds we would only add credits based on
the last successful mid in the compound which would leak credits and
eventually triggering a re-connect.

Fix this by splitting the mid processing part into two loops instead of one
where the first loop just waits for all mids and then counts how many
credits we were granted for the whole compound.
