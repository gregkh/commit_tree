media: v4l2-dv-timings: Introduce v4l2_calc_timeperframe helper

A new helper function was introduced to facilitate the calculation
of time per frame value whenever we have access to the full
v4l2_dv_timings structure.

This should be used only for receivers and only when there is
enough accuracy in the measured pixel clock value as well as in
the horizontal/vertical values.
