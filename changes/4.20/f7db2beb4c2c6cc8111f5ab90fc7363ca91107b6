vxge: ensure data0 is initialized in when fetching firmware version information

Currently variable data0 is not being initialized so a garbage value is
being passed to vxge_hw_vpath_fw_api and this value is being written to
the rts_access_steer_data0 register.  There are other occurrances where
data0 is being initialized to zero (e.g. in function
vxge_hw_upgrade_read_version) so I think it makes sense to ensure data0
is initialized likewise to 0.
