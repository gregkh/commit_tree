crypto: do not free algorithm before using

In multiple functions, the algorithm fields are read after its reference
is dropped through crypto_mod_put. In this case, the algorithm memory
may be freed, resulting in use-after-free bugs. This patch delays the
put operation until the algorithm is never used.
