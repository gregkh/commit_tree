arm64: arch_timer: Add workaround for ARM erratum 1188873

When running on Cortex-A76, a timer access from an AArch32 EL0
task may end up with a corrupted value or register. The workaround for
this is to trap these accesses at EL1/EL2 and execute them there.

This only affects versions r0p0, r1p0 and r2p0 of the CPU.
