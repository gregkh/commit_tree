mfd: cros: add charger port count command definition

A new more command has been added to the ChromeOS embedded controller
that allows to get the number of charger port count. Unlike
EC_CMD_USB_PD_PORTS, this new command also includes the dedicated

This command will be used to expose the dedicated charger port
in the ChromeOS charger driver.
