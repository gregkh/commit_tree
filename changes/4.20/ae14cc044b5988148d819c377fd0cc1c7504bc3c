lightnvm: pblk: refactor put line fn on read completion

The read completion path uses the put_line variable to decide whether
the reference on a line should be released. The function name used for
that is pblk_read_put_rqd_kref, which could lead one to believe that it
is the rqd that is releasing the reference, while it is the line
reference that is put.

Rename and also split the function in two to account for either rqd or
single ppa callers and move it to core, such that it later can be used
in the write path as well.
