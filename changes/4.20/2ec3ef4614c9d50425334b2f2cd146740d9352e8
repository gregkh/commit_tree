iwlwifi: mvm: use fast balance scan in case of DCM mode with P2P GO

Currently in case of DCM with P2P GO where BSS DTIM interval < 220 msec
the fw fails to allocate events for the P2P GO dtim due to long passive
scan events.

Fix this by requesting all scans in this scenario to be fragmented with
fast balance scan time settings.  The only exception is in case
fragmented scan was planned to be set due to low latency or high
throughput reason, set the scan timing as planned.
