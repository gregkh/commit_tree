drm/amdgpu: Deactivate SW interrupt fallback in amdgpu_fence_process v2

Deactivate SW interrupt fallback when all emited fences are completed.
Also switch interrupt SW fallback message from INFO to WARN.

v2: shorten the warning message a bit and only re-activate the timer during
processing if it was already activated before. (Christian)
