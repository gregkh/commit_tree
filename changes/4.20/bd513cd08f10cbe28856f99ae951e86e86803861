bpf: add MAP_LOOKUP_AND_DELETE_ELEM syscall

The previous patch implemented a bpf queue/stack maps that
provided the peek/pop/push functions.  There is not a direct
relationship between those functions and the current maps
syscalls, hence a new MAP_LOOKUP_AND_DELETE_ELEM syscall is added,
this is mapped to the pop operation in the queue/stack maps
and it is still to implement in other kind of maps.
