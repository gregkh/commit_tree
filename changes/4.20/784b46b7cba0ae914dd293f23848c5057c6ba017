scsi: hisi_sas: Use block layer tag instead for IPTT

Currently we use the IPTT defined in LLDD to identify IOs. Actually for
IOs which are from the block layer, they have tags to identify them. So
for those IOs, use tag of the block layer directly, and for IOs which is
not from the block layer (such as internal IOs from libsas/LLDD), reserve
96 IPTTs for them.
