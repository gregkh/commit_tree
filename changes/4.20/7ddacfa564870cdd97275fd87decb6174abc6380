ipv6: Fix PMTU updates for UDP/raw sockets in presence of VRF

Preethi reported that PMTU discovery for UDP/raw applications is not
working in the presence of VRF when the socket is not bound to a device.
The problem is that ip6_sk_update_pmtu does not consider the L3 domain
of the skb device if the socket is not bound. Update the function to
set oif to the L3 master device if relevant.
