kvm: arm64: Switch to per VM IPA limit

Now that we can manage the stage2 page table per VM, switch the
configuration details to per VM instance. The VTCR is updated
with the values specific to the VM based on the configuration.
We store the IPA size and the number of stage2 page table levels
for the guest already in VTCR. Decode it back from the vtcr
field wherever we need it.
