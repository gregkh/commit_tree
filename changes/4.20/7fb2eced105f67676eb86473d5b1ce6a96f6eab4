btrfs: open code btrfs_dev_replace_clear_lock_blocking

There's a single caller and the function name does not say it's actually
taking the lock, so open coding makes it more explicit.

For now, btrfs_dev_replace_read_lock is used instead of read_lock so
it's paired with the unlocking wrapper in the same block.
