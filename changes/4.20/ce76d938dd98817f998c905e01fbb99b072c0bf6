lib: Add memcat_p(): paste 2 pointer arrays together

This adds a helper to paste 2 pointer arrays together, useful for merging
various types of attribute arrays. There are a few places in the kernel
tree where this is open coded, and I just added one more in the STM class.

The naming is inspired by memset_p() and memcat(), and partial credit for
it goes to Andy Shevchenko.

This patch adds the function wrapped in a type-enforcing macro and a test
module.
