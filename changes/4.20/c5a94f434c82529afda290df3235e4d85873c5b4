fscache: fix race between enablement and dropping of object


It was observed that a process blocked indefintely in
__fscache_read_or_alloc_page(), waiting for FSCACHE_COOKIE_LOOKING_UP
to be cleared via fscache_wait_for_deferred_lookup().

At this time, ->backing_objects was empty, which would normaly prevent
__fscache_read_or_alloc_page() from getting to the point of waiting.
This implies that ->backing_objects was cleared *after*
__fscache_read_or_alloc_page was was entered.

When an object is "killed" and then "dropped",
FSCACHE_COOKIE_LOOKING_UP is cleared in fscache_lookup_failure(), then
KILL_OBJECT and DROP_OBJECT are "called" and only in DROP_OBJECT is
->backing_objects cleared.  This leaves a window where
something else can set FSCACHE_COOKIE_LOOKING_UP and
__fscache_read_or_alloc_page() can start waiting, before
->backing_objects is cleared

There is some uncertainty in this analysis, but it seems to be fit the
observations.  Adding the wake in this patch will be handled correctly
by __fscache_read_or_alloc_page(), as it checks if ->backing_objects
is empty again, after waiting.

Customer which reported the hang, also report that the hang cannot be
reproduced with this fix.

The backtrace for the blocked process looked like:
