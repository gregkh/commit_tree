ASoC: rsnd: ssiu: Support BUSIF other than BUSIF0

Currently only BUSIF0 is supported by SSIU, all register setting
is done only for BUSIF.

Since BUSIF1 ~ BUSIF7 has been supported, so also support
these BUSIF from SSIU.

One note is that we can't support SSI9-4/5/6/7 so far,
because its address is out of calculation rule.
