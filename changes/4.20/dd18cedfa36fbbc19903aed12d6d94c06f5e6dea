drm/i915/guc: Move the pin bias value from GuC to GGTT

Removing the pin bias from GuC allows us to not check for GuC every time
we pin a context, which fixes the assertion error on unresolved GuC
platform default in mock contexts selftest.

It also seems that we were using uninitialized WOPCM variables when
setting the GuC pin bias. The pin bias has to be set after the WOPCM,
but before the call to i915_gem_contexts_init where the first contexts
are pinned.

v2:
This also makes it so that there's no need to set GuC variables from
within the WOPCM init function or to move the WOPCM init, while keeping
the correct initialization order. Also for mock tests the pin bias is
left at 0 and we make sure that the pin bias with GuC will not be
smaller than without GuC.

v3:
Avoid unused i915 in intel_guc_ggtt_offset if debug is disabled.

v4:
Squash with WOPCM init reordering.
Moved the i915_ggtt_pin_bias helper to this patch, and made some
functions use it instead of directly dereferencing i915->ggtt.

v5:
Since we now don't use wopcm.guc.base for the pin bias there's no need to
validate it. It also has already been verified in WOPCM init.

v6:
Deleted the now unnecessarily introduced includes from previous versions.
Dropped naming changes from dev_priv to i915 for better patch readability.

v7:
Changed some comments to make more sense in the context they're in.

v8:
Moved and renamed the function which now returns the wopcm.guc.size to
intel_guc.c:intel_guc_reserved_gtt_size to avoid any possible confusion
with the pin_bias in ggtt, which should be used for pinning.
Fixed patch not applying or the most recent upstream.
