tracing/kprobes: Allow kprobe-events to record module symbol

Allow kprobe-events to record module symbols.

Since data symbols in a non-loaded module doesn't exist, it fails to
define such symbol as an argument of kprobe-event. But if the kprobe
event is defined on that module, we can defer to resolve the symbol
address.

Note that if given symbol is not found, the event is kept unavailable.
User can enable it but the event is not recorded.
