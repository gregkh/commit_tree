fbdev: Drop FBINFO_CAN_FORCE_OUTPUT flag

This was only added for the drm's fbdev emulation support, so that it
would try harder to show the Oops.

Unfortunately this never really worked reliably, and in practice ended
up pushing the real Oops off the screen due to plentyfull locking,
sleep-while-atomic and other issues. So we removed all that support
from the fbdev emulation a while back. Aside: We've also removed the
kgdb support, for similar reasons.

Since it's such a small patch I figured I don't split this up into the
usual 3-phase removal.
