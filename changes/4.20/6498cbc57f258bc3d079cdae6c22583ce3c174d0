scsi: bfa: Remove unused functions

Clang warns when a variable is assigned to itself.

This construct is usually used to avoid unused variable warnings, which
I assume is the case here. -Wunused-parameter is hidden behind -Wextra
with GCC 4.6, which is the minimum version to compile the kernel as of
commit cafa0010cd51 ("Raise the minimum required gcc version to 4.6").

However, upon further inspection, these functions aren't actually used
anywhere; they're just defined. Rather than just removing the self
assignments, remove all of this dead code.
