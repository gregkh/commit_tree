ice: Allocate VF interrupts and set queue map

Allocate VF interrupts using VPINT_ALLOC_PCI. Multiple interrupts are
specified as a range from "first" to "last".

Also, according to the spec, the queue mapping for a VF needs to be set
in both contig and scatter queue modes. So make this change as well.
