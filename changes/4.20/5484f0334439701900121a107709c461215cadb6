PM / tools: sleepgraph: first batch of v5.2 changes

general:
- add battery charge data before and after test
- remove special s0i3 handling
- remove melding of dmesg & ftrace data in old kernels, use one only
- updates to various kprobes in trace (ksys_sync, etc)
- enable pm_debug_messages during the test
- instrument more subsystems with dev functions (phy0)

error handling:
- return codes for tool show the status of the test run
- 0: success, 1: general error (no timeline), 2: fail (suspend aborted)
- monitor output of /sys/power/state, mark as failure if exception occurs
- add signal handler when using -result to catch tool exceptions

display control
- add -x commands for testing xset with mode settings and status
- allow display setting to on, off, suspend, standby
- add display mode change info to the log, along with a warning on fail

s2idle (freeze)
- remove fixed 10-phase dependency, allow any phase order & any count
- multiple phase occurences show as phase_nameN e.g. suspend_noirq3
- if multiple freezes occur, print multiple time values in header

summary:
- add new columns to summary output: issues, worst suspend/resume devices
- worst device: includes summation of all phases of suspend or resume
- issues: includes WARNING/ERROR/BUG from dmesg log, and other issues
- s2idle: multiple freezes show as FREEZExN in the issues column
