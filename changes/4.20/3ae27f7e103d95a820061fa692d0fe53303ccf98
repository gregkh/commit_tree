drm/i915/vlv: Remove redundant power well ID asserts

The callbacks these asserts are called from are used from a single power
well, so not much point in checking that. The check also requires a unique
power well ID that we would need to keep around only for this purpose.
(A follow-up patch removes power well IDs not needed for direct power
 well access).
