userfaultfd: check VM_MAYWRITE was set after verifying the uffd is registered

Calling UFFDIO_UNREGISTER on virtual ranges not yet registered in uffd
could trigger an harmless false positive WARN_ON.  Check the vma is
already registered before checking VM_MAYWRITE to shut off the false
positive warning.
