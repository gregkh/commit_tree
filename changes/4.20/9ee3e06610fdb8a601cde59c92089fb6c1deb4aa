HID: i2c-hid: override HID descriptors for certain devices

A particular touchpad (SIPODEV SP1064) refuses to supply the HID
descriptors. This patch provides the framework for overriding these
descriptors based on DMI data. It also includes the descriptors for
said touchpad, which were extracted by listening to the traffic of the
windows filter driver, as well as the DMI data for the laptops known
to use this device.
