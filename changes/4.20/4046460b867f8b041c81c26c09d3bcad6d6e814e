x86/mm/cpa: Add debug mechanism

The whole static protection magic is silently fixing up anything which is
handed in. That's just wrong. The offending call sites need to be fixed.

Add a debug mechanism which emits a warning if a requested mapping needs to be
fixed up. The DETECT debug mechanism is really not meant to be enabled except
for developers, so limit the output hard to the protection fixups.
