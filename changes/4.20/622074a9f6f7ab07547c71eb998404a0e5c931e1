vmw_balloon: remove sleeping allocations

Splitting the allocations between sleeping and non-sleeping made some
sort of sense as long as rate-limiting was enabled. Now that it is
removed, we need to decide - either we want sleeping allocations or not.

Since no other Linux balloon driver (hv, Xen, virtio) uses sleeping
allocations, use the same approach.

We do distinguish, however, between 2MB allocations and 4kB allocations
and prevent reclamation on 2MB. In both cases, we avoid using emergency
low-memory pools, as it may cause undesired effects.
