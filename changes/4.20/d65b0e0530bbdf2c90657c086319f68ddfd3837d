drm/omap: displays: Remove videomode from omap_dss_device structure

The omap_dss_device structure stores a videomode. All the connector and
panel drivers that use omap_dss_device also store the videomode in their
own panel_drv_data structures. There's no need to duplicate, remove the
videomode field from omap_dss_device.
