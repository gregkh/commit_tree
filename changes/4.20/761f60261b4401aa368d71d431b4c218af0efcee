ipv6: fix a dst leak when removing its exception

These is no need to hold dst before calling rt6_remove_exception_rt().
The call to dst_hold_safe() in ip6_link_failure() was for ip6_del_rt(),
which has been removed in Commit 93531c674315 ("net/ipv6: separate
handling of FIB entries from dst based routes"). Otherwise, it will
cause a dst leak.

This patch is to simply remove the dst_hold_safe() call before calling
rt6_remove_exception_rt() and also do the same in ip6_del_cached_rt().
It's safe, because the removal of the exception that holds its dst's
refcnt is protected by rt6_exception_lock.

Fixes: 93531c674315 ("net/ipv6: separate handling of FIB entries from dst based routes")
Fixes: 23fb93a4d3f1 ("net/ipv6: Cleanup exception and cache route handling")
