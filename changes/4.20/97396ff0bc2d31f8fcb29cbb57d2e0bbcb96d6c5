selftests/bpf: add XDP selftests for modifying and popping VLAN headers

This XDP selftest also contain a small TC-bpf component. It provoke
the generic-XDP bug fixed in previous commit.

The selftest itself shows how to do VLAN manipulation from XDP and TC.
The test demonstrate how XDP ingress can remove a VLAN tag, and how TC
egress can add back a VLAN tag.

This use-case originates from a production need by ISP (kviknet.dk),
who gets DSL-lines terminated as VLAN Q-in-Q tagged packets, and want
to avoid having an net_device for every end-customer on the box doing
the L2 to L3 termination.
  The test-setup is done via a veth-pair and creating two network
namespaces (ns1 and ns2).  The 'ns1' simulate the ISP network that are
loading the BPF-progs stripping and adding VLAN IDs.  The 'ns2'
simulate the DSL-customer that are using VLAN tagged packets.

Running the script with --interactive, will simply not call the
cleanup function.  This gives the effect of creating a testlab, that
the users can inspect and play with.  The --verbose option will simply
request that the shell will print input lines as they are read, this
include comments, which in effect make the comments visible docs.
