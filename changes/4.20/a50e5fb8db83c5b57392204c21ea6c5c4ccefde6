mac80211: fix a kernel panic when TXing after TXQ teardown

Recently TXQ teardown was moved earlier in ieee80211_unregister_hw(),
to avoid a use-after-free of the netdev data. However, interfaces
aren't fully removed at the point, and cfg80211_shutdown_all_interfaces
can for example, TX a deauth frame. Move the TXQ teardown to the
point between cfg80211_shutdown_all_interfaces and the free of
netdev queues, so we can be sure they are torn down before netdev
is freed, but after there is no ongoing TX.
