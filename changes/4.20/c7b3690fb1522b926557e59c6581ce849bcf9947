vmw_balloon: stats rework

To allow the balloon statistics to be updated concurrently, we change
the statistics to be held per core and aggregate it when needed.

To avoid the memory overhead of keeping the statistics per core, and
since it is likely not used by most users, we start updating the
statistics only after the first use. A read-write semaphore is used to
protect the statistics initialization and avoid races. This semaphore is
(and will) be used to protect configuration changes during reset.

While we are at it, address some other issues: change the statistics
update to inline functions instead of define; use ulong for saving the
statistics; and clean the statistics printouts.

Note that this patch changes the format of the outputs. If there are any
automatic tools that use the statistics, they might fail.
