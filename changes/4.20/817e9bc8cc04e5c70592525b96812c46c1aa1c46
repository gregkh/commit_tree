Revert "serial:serial_core: Allow use of CTS for PPS line discipline"

This reverts commit c550f01c810f2197c98e6e3103f81797f5e063be.

Turns out the samsung tty driver is mucking around in the "unused" port
fields and this patch breaks that code :(

So we need to fix that driver up before this can be accepted.
