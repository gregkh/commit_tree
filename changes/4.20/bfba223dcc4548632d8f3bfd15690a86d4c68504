gpio: brcmstb: allow 0 width GPIO banks

Sometimes we have empty banks within the GPIO block. This commit allows
proper handling of 0 width GPIO banks. We handle 0 width GPIO banks by
incrementing the bank and number of GPIOs, but not initializing them.
This will mean a call into the non-existent GPIOs will return an error.

Also remove "GPIO registered" dev print. This information is misleading
since the incremented banks and gpio_base do not reflect the actual GPIOs
that get initialized. We leave this information out since it is already
printed with dev_dbg.
