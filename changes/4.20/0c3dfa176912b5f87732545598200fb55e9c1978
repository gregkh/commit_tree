pinctrl: at91: don't use the same irqchip with multiple gpiochips

Sharing the same irqchip with multiple gpiochips is not a good
practice. For instance, when installing hooks, we change the state
of the irqchip. The initial state of the irqchip for the second
gpiochip to register is then disrupted.
