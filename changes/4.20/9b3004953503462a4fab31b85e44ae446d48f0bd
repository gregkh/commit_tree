ethtool: drop get_settings and set_settings callbacks

Since [gs]et_settings ethtool_ops callbacks have been deprecated in
February 2016, all in tree NIC drivers have been converted to provide
[gs]et_link_ksettings() and out of tree drivers have had enough time to do
the same.

Drop get_settings() and set_settings() and implement both ETHTOOL_[GS]SET
and ETHTOOL_[GS]LINKSETTINGS only using [gs]et_link_ksettings().
