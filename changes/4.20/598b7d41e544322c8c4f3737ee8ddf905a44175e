crypto: arm64/crc32 - remove PMULL based CRC32 driver

Now that the scalar fallbacks have been moved out of this driver into
the core crc32()/crc32c() routines, we are left with a CRC32 crypto API
driver for arm64 that is based only on 64x64 polynomial multiplication,
which is an optional instruction in the ARMv8 architecture, and is less
and less likely to be available on cores that do not also implement the
CRC32 instructions, given that those are mandatory in the architecture
as of ARMv8.1.

Since the scalar instructions do not require the special handling that
SIMD instructions do, and since they turn out to be considerably faster
on some cores (Cortex-A53) as well, there is really no point in keeping
this code around so let's just remove it.
