i2c: uniphier-f: fix violation of tLOW requirement for Fast-mode

Currently, the clock duty is set as tLOW/tHIGH = 1/1. For Fast-mode,
tLOW is set to 1.25 us while the I2C spec requires tLOW >= 1.3 us.

tLOW/tHIGH = 5/4 would meet both Standard-mode and Fast-mode:
  Standard-mode: tLOW = 5.56 us, tHIGH = 4.44 us
  Fast-mode:     tLOW = 1.39 us, tHIGH = 1.11 us
