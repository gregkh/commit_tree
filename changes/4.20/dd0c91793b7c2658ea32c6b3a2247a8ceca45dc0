bcache: fix ioctl in flash device

When doing ioctl in flash device, it will call ioctl_dev() in super.c,
then we should not to get cached device since flash only device has
no backend device. This patch just move the jugement dc->io_disable
to cached_dev_ioctl() to make ioctl in flash device correctly.
