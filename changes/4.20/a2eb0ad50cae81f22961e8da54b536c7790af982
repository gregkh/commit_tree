s390/qeth: on gdev release, reset drvdata

qeth_core_probe_device() sets the gdev's drvdata, but doesn't reset it
on a subsequent error. Move the (re-)setting around a bit, so that it
happens symmetrically on allocating/freeing the qeth_card struct.

This is no actual problem, as the ccwgroup core will discard the gdev
on a probe error. But from qeth's perspective the gdev is an external
resource, so it's best to manage it cleanly.
