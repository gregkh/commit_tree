arm64/mm: Pass ttbr1 as a parameter to __enable_mmu()

In subsequent patches we'll use a transient pgd during the primary cpu's
boot process. To make this work while allowing secondary cpus to use the
swapper_pg_dir, we need to pass the relevant TTBR1 pgd as a parameter
to __enable_mmu().

This patch updates __enable__mmu() to take this as a parameter, updating
callsites to pass swapper_pg_dir for now.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
