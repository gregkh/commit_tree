powerpc/pseries: Export raw per-CPU VPA data via debugfs

This patch exports the raw per-CPU VPA data via debugfs.
A per-CPU file is created which exports the VPA data of
that CPU to help debug some of the VPA related issues or
to analyze the per-CPU VPA related statistics.

v3: Removed offline CPU check.

v2: Included offline CPU check and other review comments.
