usb: typec: fusb302: reorganizing the probe function a little

The debugfs needs to be initialized as the last step in
probe in this case. The struct dentry *rootdir can't be
pointing to anything unless driver probe really finishes
successfully.

It is also not necessary to clear the i2c clientdata if the
probe fails, so removing the extra label used for that.
