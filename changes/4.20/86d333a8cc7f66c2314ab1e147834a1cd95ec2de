cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add base_frequency attribute

Expose base_frequency to user space via cpufreq sysfs when HWP is in
use.

This HWP base frequency is read from the ACPI _CPC object if present,
or from the HWP Capabilities MSR otherwise.

On the majority of the HWP platforms the _CPC object will point to
the HWP Capabilities MSR using the "Functional Fixed Hardware"
address space type.  The address space type also can simply be
ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER, however, in which case the platform firmware
can set its value at the initialization time based on the system
constraints.
