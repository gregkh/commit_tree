EDAC, skx_edac: Fix logical channel intermediate decoding

The code "lchan = (lchan << 1) | ~lchan" for logical channel
intermediate decoding is wrong. The wrong intermediate decoding
result is {0xffffffff, 0xfffffffe}.

Fix it by replacing '~' with '!'. The correct intermediate
decoding result is {0x1, 0x2}.
