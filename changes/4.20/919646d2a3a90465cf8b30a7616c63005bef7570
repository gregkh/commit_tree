selftests/bpf: extend the storage test to test per-cpu cgroup storage

This test extends the cgroup storage test to use per-cpu flavor
of the cgroup storage as well.

The test initializes a per-cpu cgroup storage to some non-zero initial
value (1000), and then simple bumps a per-cpu counter each time
the shared counter is atomically incremented. Then it reads all
per-cpu areas from the userspace side, and checks that the sum
of values adds to the expected sum.

Expected output:
  $ ./test_cgroup_storage
  test_cgroup_storage:PASS
