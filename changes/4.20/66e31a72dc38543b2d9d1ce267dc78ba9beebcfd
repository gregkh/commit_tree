drm/sti: do not remove the drm_bridge that was never added

Removing the drm_bridge_remove call should avoid a NULL dereference
during list processing in drm_bridge_remove if the error path is ever
taken.

The more natural approach would perhaps be to add a drm_bridge_add,
but there are several other bridges that never call drm_bridge_add.
Just removing the drm_bridge_remove is the easier fix.
