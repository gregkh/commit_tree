drm/amd/powerplay: added vega20 overdrive support V3

Added vega20 overdrive support based on existing OD sysfs
APIs. However, the OD logics are simplified on vega20. So,
the behavior will be a little different and works only on
some limited levels.

V2: fix typo
    fix commit description
    revise error logs
    add support for clock OD

V3: separate clock from voltage OD settings
