perf/x86: Add helper to obtain performance counter index

perf_event_read_local() is the safest way to obtain measurements
associated with performance events. In some cases the overhead
introduced by perf_event_read_local() affects the measurements and the
use of rdpmcl() is needed. rdpmcl() requires the index
of the performance counter used so a helper is introduced to determine
the index used by a provided performance event.

The index used by a performance event may change when interrupts are
enabled. A check is added to ensure that the index is only accessed
with interrupts disabled. Even with this check the use of this counter
needs to be done with care to ensure it is queried and used within the
same disabled interrupts section.

This change introduces a new checkpatch warning:
CHECK: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
+extern int x86_perf_rdpmc_index(struct perf_event *event);

This warning was discussed and designated as a false positive in
