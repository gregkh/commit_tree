smb2: fix uninitialized variable bug in smb2_ioctl_query_info

There is a potential execution path in which variable *resp_buftype*
is passed as an argument to function free_rsp_buf(), in which it is
used in a comparison without being properly initialized previously.

Fix this by initializing variable *resp_buftype* to CIFS_NO_BUFFER
in order to avoid unpredictable or unintended results.
