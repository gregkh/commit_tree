gfs2: Fix iomap buffer head reference counting bug

GFS2 passes the inode buffer head (dibh) from gfs2_iomap_begin to
gfs2_iomap_end in iomap->private.  It sets that private pointer in
gfs2_iomap_get.  Users of gfs2_iomap_get other than gfs2_iomap_begin
would have to release iomap->private, but this isn't done correctly,
leading to a leak of buffer head references.

To fix this, move the code for setting iomap->private from
gfs2_iomap_get to gfs2_iomap_begin.
