usb: host: fotg2: add silicon clock handling

When used in a system with software-controlled silicon clocks,
the FOTG210 needs to grab, prepare and enable the clock.

This is needed on for example the Cortina Gemini, where the
platform will by default gate off the clock unless the
peripheral (in this case the USB driver) grabs and enables
the clock.

If there is no clock available on the platform, we live
without it. Make sure to percolate probe deferrals.
