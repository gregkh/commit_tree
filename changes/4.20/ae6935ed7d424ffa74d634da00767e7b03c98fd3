vmbus: split ring buffer allocation from open

The UIO driver needs the ring buffer to be persistent(reused)
across open/close. Split the allocation and setup of ring buffer
out of vmbus_open. For normal usage vmbus_open/vmbus_close there
are no changes; only impacts uio_hv_generic which needs to keep
ring buffer memory and reuse when application restarts.
