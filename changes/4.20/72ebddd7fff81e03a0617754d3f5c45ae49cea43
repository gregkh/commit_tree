selftests: pmtu: extend MTU parsing helper to locked MTU

The mtu_parse helper introduced in commit f2c929feeccd ("selftests:
pmtu: Factor out MTU parsing helper") can only handle "mtu 1234", but
not "mtu lock 1234". Extend it, so that we can do IPv4 tests with PMTU
smaller than net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu
