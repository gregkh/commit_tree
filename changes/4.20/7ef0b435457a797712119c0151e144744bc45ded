drm/amdgpu: Need to set moved to true when evict bo

Fix the VMC page fault when the running sequence is as below:
1.amdgpu_gem_create_ioctl
2.ttm_bo_swapout->amdgpu_vm_bo_invalidate, as not called
amdgpu_vm_bo_base_init, so won't called
list_add_tail(&base->bo_list, &bo->va). Even the bo was evicted,
it won't set the bo_base->moved.
3.drm_gem_open_ioctl->amdgpu_vm_bo_base_init, here only called
list_move_tail(&base->vm_status, &vm->evicted), but not set the
bo_base->moved.
4.amdgpu_vm_bo_map->amdgpu_vm_bo_insert_map, as the bo_base->moved is
not set true, the function amdgpu_vm_bo_insert_map will call
list_move(&bo_va->base.vm_status, &vm->moved)
5.amdgpu_cs_ioctl won't validate the swapout bo, as it is only in the
moved list, not in the evict list. So VMC page fault occurs.
