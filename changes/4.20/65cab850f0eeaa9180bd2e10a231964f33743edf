net: Allow class-e address assignment via ifconfig ioctl

While most distributions long ago switched to the iproute2 suite
of utilities, which allow class-e (240.0.0.0/4) address assignment,
distributions relying on busybox, toybox and other forms of
ifconfig cannot assign class-e addresses without this kernel patch.

While CIDR has been obsolete for 2 decades, and a survey of all the
open source code in the world shows the IN_whatever macros are also
obsolete... rather than obsolete CIDR from this ioctl entirely, this
patch merely enables class-e assignment, sanely.
