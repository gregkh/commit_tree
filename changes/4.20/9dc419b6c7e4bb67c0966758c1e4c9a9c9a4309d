pwm: lpss: Move struct pwm_lpss_chip definition to the header file

Move struct pwm_lpss_chip definition from pwm-lpss.c to pwm-lpss.h,
so that the pci/platform drivers can access the info member
(struct pwm_lpss_boardinfo *).

This is a preparation patch for adding platform specific quirks, which
the drivers need access to, to pwm_lpss_boardinfo.
