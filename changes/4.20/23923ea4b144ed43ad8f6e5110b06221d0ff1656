octeontx2-af: Config NPC KPU engines with parser profile

This patch configures all 16 KPUs and iKPU (pkinds) with
the KPU parser profile defined in npc_profile.h. Each KPU
engine has a 128 entry CAM, only CAM entries which are listed
in the profile are enabled and rest are left disabled.

Also
- Memory is allocated for pkind's bitmap and PFFUNC, interface
  channel mapping.
- Added all CSR offsets of NPC HW block.
