fuse: fix fsync on directory

Commit ab2257e9941b ("fuse: reduce size of struct fuse_inode") moved parts
of fields related to writeback on regular file and to directory caching
into a union.  However fuse_fsync_common() called from fuse_dir_fsync()
touches some writeback related fields, resulting in a crash.

Move writeback related parts from fuse_fsync_common() to fuse_fysnc().
