mmc: sdhci: sirf: Use the slot GPIO descriptor

This driver is complicating things for no reason: the "cd"
GPIO can easily be retrieved from the device tree if present
using just mmc_gpiod_request_cd(), which will fetch the
descriptor from the device tree using the standard binding
just fine.

If the retrieveal is successful, we also request the IRQ.

As a result the private subdriver data can be removed
entirely.
