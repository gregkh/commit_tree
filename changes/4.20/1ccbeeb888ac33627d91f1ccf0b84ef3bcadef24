media: dvb: fix compat ioctl translation

The VIDEO_GET_EVENT and VIDEO_STILLPICTURE was added back in 2005 but
it never worked because the command number is wrong.

Using the right command number means we have a better chance of them
actually doing the right thing, though clearly nobody has ever tried
it successfully.

I noticed these while auditing the remaining users of compat_time_t
for y2038 bugs. This one is fine in that regard, it just never did
anything.

Fixes: 6e87abd0b8cb ("[DVB]: Add compat ioctl handling.")
