nfp: bpf: parse global BPF ABI version capability

Up until now we only had per-vNIC BPF ABI version capabilities,
which are slightly awkward to use because bulk of the resources
and configuration does not relate to any particular vNIC.  Add
a new capability for global ABI version and check the per-vNIC
version are equal to it.  Assume the ABI version 2 if no explicit
version capability is present.
