clk: ti: am33xx: add new clkctrl data for am33xx

The new clkctrl data layout for am33xx is split based on clockdomain
boundaries. Previously the split was based on CM boundaries. This patch
adds the new data as separate data entity, retaining the compatibility
data also for now. The compatibility data can be removed once no longer
needed.
