blkcg: cleanup and make blk_get_rl use blkg_lookup_create

blk_get_rl is responsible for identifying which request_list a request
should be allocated to. Try get logic was added earlier, but
semantically the logic was not changed.

This patch makes better use of the bio already having a reference to the
blkg in the hot path. The cold path uses a better fallback of
blkg_lookup_create rather than just blkg_lookup and then falling back to
the q->root_rl. If lookup_create fails with anything but -ENODEV, it
falls back to q->root_rl.

A clarifying comment is added to explain why q->root_rl is used rather
than the root blkg's rl.
