smb3 - clean up debug output displaying network interfaces

Make the output of /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData a little easier to
read by cleaning up the listing of network interfaces removing
a wasted line break.

Here is a comparison of the network interface information
that from be viewed at the end of output from

     "cat /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData"

Before:

	Server interfaces: 8
	0)
		Speed: 10000000000 bps
		Capabilities: rss
		IPv6: fe80:0000:0000:0000:2cf5:407e:84b0:21dd
	1)
		Speed: 1000000000 bps
		Capabilities:
		IPv6: fe80:0000:0000:0000:61cd:6147:3d0c:f484

vs. after:

	Server interfaces: 11
	0)	Speed: 10000000000 bps
		Capabilities: rss
		IPv6: fe80:0000:0000:0000:2cf5:407e:84b0:21dd
	1)	Speed: 2000000000 bps
		Capabilities:
		IPv6: fe80:0000:0000:0000:3d76:2d05:dcf8:ed10
