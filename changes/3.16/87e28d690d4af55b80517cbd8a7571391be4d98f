staging: rtl8188eu: Simplify led blinking strategy code.

driver has code to blink the led in 7 different ways.
struct led_priv contains an enum LED_STRATEGY_871x variable which is
initialized to SW_LED_MODE1 inside rtl8188eu_InitSwLeds() function.
it means driver is hard coded to use only SW_LED_MODE1 blinking strategy.
so we can remove the code related to other blinking strategies
e.g. SW_LED_MODE[0|2|3|4|5|6].
