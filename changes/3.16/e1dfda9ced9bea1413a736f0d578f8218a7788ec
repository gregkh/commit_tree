arm64: xchg: prevent warning if return value is unused

Some users of xchg() don't bother using the return value, which results
in a compiler warning like the following (from kgdb):

    atomic_xchg(&kgdb_active, cpu);
    ^

This patch makes use of the same trick as we do for cmpxchg, by assigning
the return value to a dummy variable in the xchg() macro itself.
