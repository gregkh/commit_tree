KVM: s390: Allow skeys to be enabled for the current process

Introduce a new function s390_enable_skey(), which enables storage key
handling via setting the use_skey flag in the mmu context.

This function is only useful within the context of kvm.

Note that enabling storage keys will cause a one-time hickup when
walking the page table; however, it saves us special effort for cases
like clear reset while making it possible for us to be architecture
conform.

s390_enable_skey() takes the page table lock to prevent reseting
storage keys triggered from multiple vcpus.
