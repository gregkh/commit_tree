can: mcp251x: Improve mcp251x_hw_reset()

The MCP251x utilizes an oscillator startup timer (OST), which holds the
chip in reset, to insure that the oscillator has stabilized before the
internal state machine begins to operate. The OST maintains reset for
the first 128 OSC clock cycles after power up or reset.
So, this patch removes unnecessary loops and reduce delay for power on
and reset to the safe value.
