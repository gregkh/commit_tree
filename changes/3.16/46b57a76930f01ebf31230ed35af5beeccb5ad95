x86/vdso: Move DISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING into the vdso makefile

DISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING turns off branch profiling (i.e. a
redefinition of 'if').  Branch profiling depends on a bunch of
kernel-internal symbols and generates extra output sections, none of
which are useful or functional in the vDSO.

It's currently turned off for vclock_gettime.c, but vgetcpu.c also
triggers branch profiling, so just turn it off in the makefile.

This fixes the build on some configurations: the vdso could contain
undefined symbols, and the fake section table overflowed due to
ftrace's added sections.
