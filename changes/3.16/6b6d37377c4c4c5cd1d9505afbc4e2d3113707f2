mtd: st_spi_fsm: Add support for Macronix MX25L3255E

This patch adds support for the Macronix MX25L3255E device.  Unlike the other
Macronix devices we have seen, this device supports WRITE_1_4_4 at reasonable
frequencies.  Rather than masking out WRITE_1_4_4 support altogether, we now
rely on the table parameters to indicate whether or not WRITE_1_4_4 should be
used.
