f2fs: avoid not to call remove_dirty_inode

There is an errorneous case during the recovery like below.

In recovery_dentry,
 1) dir = f2fs_iget();
 2) mark the dir with FI_DELAY_IPUT
 3) goto unmap_out

After the end of recovery routine, there is no dirty dentries so the dir cannot
be released by iput in remove_dirty_dir_inode.

This patch fixes such the bug case by handling the iget and iput in the
recovery_dentry procedure.
