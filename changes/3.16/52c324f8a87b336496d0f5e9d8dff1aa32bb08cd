cpuidle: Combine cpuidle_enabled() with cpuidle_select()

Since both cpuidle_enabled() and cpuidle_select() are only called by
cpuidle_idle_call(), it is not really useful to keep them separate
and combining them will help to avoid complicating cpuidle_idle_call()
even further if governors are changed to return error codes sometimes.

This code modification shouldn't lead to any functional changes.
