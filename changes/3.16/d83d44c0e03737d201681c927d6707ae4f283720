MIPS: Octeon: Remove checks for CONFIG_CAVIUM_GDB

Three checks for CONFIG_CAVIUM_GDB were added in v2.6.29. But the
Kconfig symbol CAVIUM_GDB was never added to the tree. Remove these
checks.

Also remove the last reference to octeon_get_boot_debug_flag(). There is
no definition of that function anyway.
