fuse: add FUSE_NO_OPEN_SUPPORT flag to INIT

Here some additional changes to set a capability flag so that clients can
detect when it's appropriate to return -ENOSYS from open.

This amends the following commit introduced in 3.14:

  7678ac50615d  fuse: support clients that don't implement 'open'

However we can only add the flag to 3.15 and later since there was no
protocol version update in 3.14.
