nfsd4: adjust buflen to session channel limit

We can simplify session limit enforcement by restricting the xdr buflen
to the session size.

Also fix a preexisting bug: we should really have been taking into
account the auth-required space when comparing against session limits,
which are limits on the size of the entire rpc reply, including any krb5
overhead.
