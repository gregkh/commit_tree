MIPS: add kmap_noncoherent to wire a cached non-coherent TLB entry

This is identical to kmap_coherent apart from the cache coherency
attribute used for the TLB entry, so kmap_coherent is abstracted to
kmap_prot which is then called for both kmap_coherent &
kmap_noncoherent. This will be used by a subsequent patch.
