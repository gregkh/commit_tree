ARM: mvebu: use a separate function to set the boot address of CPUs

Setting the start (or boot) address of a CPU is no more used only
during SMP bring up on Armada 370/XP, but it will also be used by the
CPU idle function of Armada XP, and by the Armada 38x SMP support.

Therefore this commit creates a separate PMSU function to set the boot
address of a CPU with the PMSU.
