powerpc/tm: Add checking to treclaim/trechkpt

If we do a treclaim and we are not in TM suspend mode, it results in a TM bad
thing (ie. a 0x700 program check).  Similarly if we do a trechkpt and we have
an active transaction or TEXASR Failure Summary (FS) is not set, we also take a
TM bad thing.

This should never happen, but if it does (ie. a kernel bug), the cause is
almost impossible to debug as the GPR state is mostly userspace and hence we
don't get a call chain.

This adds some checks in these cases case a BUG_ON() (in asm) in case we ever
hit these cases.  It moves the register saving around to preserve r1 till later
also.
