ARM: tegra: Support reboot modes

The boot ROM on Tegra SoCs supports booting into forced recovery mode
(RCM) by setting a bit in the PMC scratch register 0. Similarily, the
Android bootloader examines some of the bits in this register to disable
autoboot or enter recovery mode.

Support these modes by setting the corresponding bits depending on the
specified reboot command (forced-recovery, bootloader, recovery). Recent
systemd-based distributions allow this to be specified using an optional
argument to the reboot command.
