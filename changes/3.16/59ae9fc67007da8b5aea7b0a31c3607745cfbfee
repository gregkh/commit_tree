xen-netback: Fix handling of skbs requiring too many slots

A recent commit (a02eb4 "xen-netback: worse-case estimate in xenvif_rx_action is
underestimating") capped the slot estimation to MAX_SKB_FRAGS, but that triggers
the next BUG_ON a few lines down, as the packet consumes more slots than
estimated.
This patch introduces full_coalesce on the skb callback buffer, which is used in
start_new_rx_buffer() to decide whether netback needs coalescing more
aggresively. By doing that, no packet should need more than
(XEN_NETIF_MAX_TX_SIZE + 1) / PAGE_SIZE data slots (excluding the optional GSO
slot, it doesn't carry data, therefore irrelevant in this case), as the provided
buffers are fully utilized.
