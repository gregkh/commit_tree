x86, tsc: Fix cpufreq lockup

Mauro reported that his AMD X2 using the powernow-k8 cpufreq driver
locked up when doing cpu hotplug.

Because we called set_cyc2ns_scale() from the time_cpufreq_notifier()
unconditionally, it gets called multiple times for each freq change,
instead of only the once, when the tsc_khz value actually changes.

Because it gets called more than once, we run out of cyc2ns data slots
and stall, waiting for a free one, but because we're half way offline,
there's no consumers to free slots.

By placing the call inside the condition that actually changes tsc_khz
we avoid superfluous calls and avoid the problem.
