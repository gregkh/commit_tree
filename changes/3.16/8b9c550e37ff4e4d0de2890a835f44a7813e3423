ARM: bcm: use inline assembly for "smc" request

Move the code that implements the "smc" call into a C function that
uses inline assembly.  This allows us to make that function private,
and enables us to get rid of "arch/arm/mach-bcm/bcm_kona_smc_asm.S".
Rename what had been the "buffer_addr" argument to be "buffer_phys"
so it's consistent with other usage in this file.

Since it's now easy to do, verify that r12 contains SEC_EXIT_NORMAL
upon completion of the SMC.  There really isn't a good way to handle
the abnormal completion of a secure monitor request.

Since "bcm_kona_smc.h" is now only included from C files, eliminate
the #ifndef __ASSEMBLY__.
