Fix ARM merge mistake in mvebu board file

Russell King points out that my ARM merge (commit eb3d3ec567e8) was
broken wrt the arch/arm/mach-mvebu/board-v7.c file, leaving in a stale
l2x0_of_init() call (it's now handled by the DT description).

Which is kind of embarrassing, since I knew about it as it wasn't the
only file that had similar merge issues.  At least I got the other ones
right.
