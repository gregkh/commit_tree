KVM: s390: a VCPU is already started when delivering interrupts

This patch removes the start of a VCPU when delivering a RESTART interrupt.
Interrupt delivery is called from kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run. So the VCPU is
already considered started - no need to call kvm_s390_vcpu_start. This function
will early exit anyway.
