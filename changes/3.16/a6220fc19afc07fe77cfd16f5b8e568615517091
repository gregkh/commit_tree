PM / suspend: Always use deepest C-state in the "freeze" sleep state

If freeze_enter() is called, we want to bypass the current cpuidle
governor and always use the deepest available (that is, not disabled)
C-state, because we want to save as much energy as reasonably possible
then and runtime latency constraints don't matter at that point, since
the system is in a sleep state anyway.
