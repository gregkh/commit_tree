ARM/ARM64: KVM: Emulate PSCI v0.2 SYSTEM_OFF and SYSTEM_RESET

The PSCI v0.2 SYSTEM_OFF and SYSTEM_RESET functions are system-level
functions hence cannot be fully emulated by in-kernel PSCI emulation code.

To tackle this, we forward PSCI v0.2 SYSTEM_OFF and SYSTEM_RESET function
calls from vcpu to user space (i.e. QEMU or KVMTOOL) via kvm_run structure
using KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT exit reasons.
