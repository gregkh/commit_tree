uprobes/x86: Kill adjust_ret_addr(), simplify UPROBE_FIX_CALL logic

The only insn which could have both UPROBE_FIX_IP and UPROBE_FIX_CALL
was 0xe8 "call relative", and now it is handled by branch_xol_ops.

So we can change default_post_xol_op(UPROBE_FIX_CALL) to simply push
the address of next insn == utask->vaddr + insn.length, just we need
to record insn.length into the new auprobe->def.ilen member.

Note: if/when we teach branch_xol_ops to support jcxz/loopz we can
remove the "correction" logic, UPROBE_FIX_IP can use the same address.
