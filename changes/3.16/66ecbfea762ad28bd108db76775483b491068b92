clk: mvebu: add Orion5x clock driver

This commit adds a core clock driver for the Orion5x SoC, with support
for the tclk, the CPU frequency and the DDR frequency. All the details
about the Sample-At-Reset register were extracted from the U-Boot
sources for Orion5x.

Note that Orion5x does not have gatable clocks, so this core clock
driver is sufficient to support clocking on Orion5x platforms.
