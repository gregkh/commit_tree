PM / OPP: Move cpufreq specific OPP functions out of generic OPP library

CPUFreq specific helper functions for OPP (Operating Performance Points)
now use generic OPP functions that allow CPUFreq to be be moved back
into CPUFreq framework. This allows for independent modifications
or future enhancements as needed isolated to just CPUFreq framework
alone.

Here, we just move relevant code and documentation to make this part of
CPUFreq infrastructure.
