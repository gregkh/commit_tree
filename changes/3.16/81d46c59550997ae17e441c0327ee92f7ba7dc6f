mtd: onenand: fix build warning for dma type

The samsung onenand driver passes around a dma address token
through a void pointer, which is incorrect and leads to
warnings like this one:

onenand/samsung.c:548:2: warning: passing argument 1 of '__fswab32' makes integer from pointer without a cast [enabled by default]
  writel(src, base + S5PC110_DMA_SRC_ADDR);
  ^

This patch makes it use dma_addr_t here, which is more appropriate.
