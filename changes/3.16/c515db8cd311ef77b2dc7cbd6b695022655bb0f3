sched/numa: Fix initialization of sched_domain_topology for NUMA

Jet Chen has reported a kernel panics when booting qemu-system-x86_64 with
kvm64 cpu. A panic occured while building the sched_domain.

In sched_init_numa, we create a new topology table in which both default
levels and numa levels are copied. The last row of the table must have a null
pointer in the mask field.

The current implementation doesn't add this last row in the computation of the
table size. So we add 1 row in the allocation size that will be used as the
last row of the table. The kzalloc will ensure that the mask field is NULL.
