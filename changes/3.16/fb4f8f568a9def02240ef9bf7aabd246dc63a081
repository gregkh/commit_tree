Input: elantech - don't set bit 1 of reg_10 when the no_hw_res quirk is set

The touchpad on the GIGABYTE U2442 not only stops communicating when we try
to set bit 3 (enable real hardware resolution) of reg_10, but on some BIOS
versions also when we set bit 1 (enable two finger mode auto correct).

I've asked the original reporter of:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61151

To check that not setting bit 1 does not lead to any adverse effects on his
model / BIOS revision, and it does not, so this commit fixes the touchpad
not working on these versions by simply never setting bit 1 for laptop
models with the no_hw_res quirk.
