uprobes/x86: Send SIGILL if arch_uprobe_post_xol() fails

Currently the error from arch_uprobe_post_xol() is silently ignored.
This doesn't look good and this can lead to the hard-to-debug problems.

1. Change handle_singlestep() to loudly complain and send SIGILL.

   Note: this only affects x86, ppc/arm can't fail.

2. Change arch_uprobe_post_xol() to call arch_uprobe_abort_xol() and
   avoid TF games if it is going to return an error.

   This can help to to analyze the problem, if nothing else we should
   not report ->ip = xol_slot in the core-file.

   Note: this means that handle_riprel_post_xol() can be called twice,
   but this is fine because it is idempotent.
