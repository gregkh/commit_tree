drbd: use list_first_entry_or_null in first_peer_device/first_connection

If there are no peer_devices or connections, I'd rather have NULL
than some "arbitrary" address pretending to point to a struct.

Helps to avoid hard to debug symptoms, in case we ever try to use
and dereference a drbd_connection or drbd_peer_device
where we in fact don't have any connection at all.
