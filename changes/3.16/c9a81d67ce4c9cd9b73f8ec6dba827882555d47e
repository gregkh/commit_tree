mfd: cros_ec: spi: Make the cros_ec_spi timeout more reliable

The cros_ec_spi transfer had two problems with its timeout code:

1. It looked at the timeout even in the case that it found valid data.
2. If the cros_ec_spi code got switched out for a while, it's possible
   it could get a timeout after a single loop.  Let's be paranoid and
   make sure we do one last transfer after the timeout expires.
