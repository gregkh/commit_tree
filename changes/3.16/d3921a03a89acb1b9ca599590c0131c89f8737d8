staging: tidspbridge: check for CONFIG_SND_OMAP_SOC_MCBSP

Commit d0f47ff17f29 ("ASoC: OMAP: Build config cleanup for McBSP")
removed the Kconfig symbol OMAP_MCBSP. It left two checks for
CONFIG_OMAP_MCBSP untouched.

Convert these to checks for CONFIG_SND_OMAP_SOC_MCBSP. That must be
correct, since that re-enables calls to functions that are all found in
sound/soc/omap/mcbsp.c. And that file is built only if
CONFIG_SND_OMAP_SOC_MCBSP is defined.
