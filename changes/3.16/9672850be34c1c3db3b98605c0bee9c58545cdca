net: mvneta: Clean-up mvneta_init()

This commit cleans-up mvneta_init(), which initializes the hardware
and allocates the rx/qx queues. The queue allocation is simplified
by using devm_kcalloc instead of kzalloc. The unused phy_addr parameter
is removed. While here, the 'hal' references in the comments are removed.
This commit makes no functionality change.
