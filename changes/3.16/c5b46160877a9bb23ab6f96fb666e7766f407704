net/core: Add VF link state control policy

Commit 1d8faf48c7 (net/core: Add VF link state control) added VF link state
control to the netlink VF nested structure, but failed to add a proper entry
for the new structure into the VF policy table.  Add the missing entry so
the table and the actual data copied into the netlink nested struct are in
sync.
