blk-mq: respect rq_affinity

The blk-mq code is using it's own version of the I/O completion affinity
tunables, which causes a few issues:

 - the rq_affinity sysfs file doesn't work for blk-mq devices, even if it
   still is present, thus breaking existing tuning setups.
 - the rq_affinity = 1 mode, which is the defauly for legacy request based
   drivers isn't implemented at all.
 - blk-mq drivers don't implement any completion affinity with the default
   flag settings.

This patches removes the blk-mq ipi_redirect flag and sysfs file, as well
as the internal BLK_MQ_F_SHOULD_IPI flag and replaces it with code that
respects the queue-wide rq_affinity flags and also implements the
rq_affinity = 1 mode.

This means I/O completion affinity can now only be tuned block-queue wide
instead of per context, which seems more sensible to me anyway.
