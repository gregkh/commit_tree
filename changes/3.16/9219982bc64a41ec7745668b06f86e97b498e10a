i2c: nomadik: Fixup system suspend

For !CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME, the device were never put back into active
state while resuming.

For CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME, we blindly trusted the device to be inactive
while we were about to handle it at suspend late, which is just too
optimistic.

Even if the driver uses pm_runtime_put_sync() after each tranfer to
return it's runtime PM resources, there are no guarantees this will
actually mean the device will inactivated. The reason is that the PM
core will prevent runtime suspend during system suspend, and thus when
a transfer occurs during the early phases of system suspend the device
will be kept active after the transfer.

To handle both issues above, use pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() from
the system suspend|resume callbacks.
