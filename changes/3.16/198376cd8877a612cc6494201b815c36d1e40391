tracing: Eliminate double free on failure of allocation on boot up

If allocation of the max_buffer fails on boot up, the error path will
free both per_cpu data structures from the buffers. With the new redesign
of the code, those structures are freed if allocations failed. That is,
the helper function that allocates the buffers will free the per cpu data
on failure. No need to do it again. In fact, the second free will cause
a bug as the code can not handle a double free.
