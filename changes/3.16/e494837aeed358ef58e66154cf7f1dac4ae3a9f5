    drm/i915: get a runtime PM ref for the deferred GT powersave enabling

I added an RPM get-ref when enabling RPS from a deferred work, but forgot
to add the corresponding put-ref when canceling the work. This may leave
RPM disabled.

Note that the race is real since we run the rps enabling with a
delayed work item after resume, so leaves enough time (in contrived
examples) to fit a quick autoresum in.
