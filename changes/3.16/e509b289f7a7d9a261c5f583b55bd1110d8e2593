ARM: exynos: cleanup kconfig option display

The addition of Exynos to multi-platform configs creates a mess of config
options with options appearing before the Exynos config option. This is
due to arch/arm/plat-samsung/Kconfig being included out of order with the
other Samsung platform kconfig files. Reorder the kconfig files and move
all the options into a sub-menu. Some of the options are dead, so remove
those as well.
