ARM: l2c: move L2 cache register saving to a more sensible location

Move the L2 cache register saving to a more sensible location - after
the cache has been enabled, and fixups have been run.  We move the
saving of the auxiliary control register into the ->save function as
well which makes everything operate in a sane and maintainable way.
