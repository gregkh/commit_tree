tracing: Add __get_dynamic_array_len() macro for trace events

If a trace event uses a dynamic array for something other than a string
then there's currently no way the TP_printk() can figure out what size
it is. A __get_dynamic_array_len() is required to know the length.

This also simplifies the __get_bitmask() macro which required it as well,
but instead just hardcoded it.
