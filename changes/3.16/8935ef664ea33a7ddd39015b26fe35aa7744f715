NFSv4: Use error handler on failed GETATTR with successful OPEN

Place the call to resend the failed GETATTR under the error handler so that
when appropriate, the GETATTR is retried more than once.

The server can fail the GETATTR op in the OPEN compound with a recoverable
error such as NFS4ERR_DELAY. In the case of an O_EXCL open, the server has
created the file, so a retrans of the OPEN call will fail with NFS4ERR_EXIST.
