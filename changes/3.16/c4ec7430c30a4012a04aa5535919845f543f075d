memory: mvebu-devbus: add Orion5x support

This commit adds support for the Orion5x family of Marvell processors
into the mvebu-devbus driver. It differs from the already supported
Armada 370/XP by:

 * Having a single register (instead of two) for doing all the timing
   configuration.

 * Having a few less timing configuration parameters.

For this reason, a separate compatible string "marvell,orion-devbus"
is introduced.
