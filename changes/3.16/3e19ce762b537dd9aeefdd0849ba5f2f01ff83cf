rpc: xdr_truncate_encode

This will be used in the server side in a few cases:
	- when certain operations (read, readdir, readlink) fail after
	  encoding a partial response.
	- when we run out of space after encoding a partial response.
	- in readlink, where we initially reserve PAGE_SIZE bytes for
	  data, then truncate to the actual size.
