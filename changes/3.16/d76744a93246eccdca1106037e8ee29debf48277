mwifiex: fix Tx timeout issue

It is observed that sometimes Tx packet is downloaded without
adding driver's txpd header. This results in firmware parsing
garbage data as packet length. Sometimes firmware is unable
to read the packet if length comes out as invalid. This stops
further traffic and timeout occurs.

The root cause is uninitialized fields in tx_info(skb->cb) of
packet used to get garbage values. In this case if
MWIFIEX_BUF_FLAG_REQUEUED_PKT flag is mistakenly set, txpd
header was skipped. This patch makes sure that tx_info is
correctly initialized to fix the problem.
