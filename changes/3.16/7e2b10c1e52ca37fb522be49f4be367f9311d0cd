net: Support for multiple checksums with gso

When creating a GSO packet segment we may need to set more than
one checksum in the packet (for instance a TCP checksum and
UDP checksum for VXLAN encapsulation). To be efficient, we want
to do checksum calculation for any part of the packet at most once.

This patch adds csum_start offset to skb_gso_cb. This tracks the
starting offset for skb->csum which is initially set in skb_segment.
When a protocol needs to compute a transport checksum it calls
gso_make_checksum which computes the checksum value from the start
of transport header to csum_start and then adds in skb->csum to get
the full checksum. skb->csum and csum_start are then updated to reflect
the checksum of the resultant packet starting from the transport header.

This patch also adds a flag to skbuff, encap_hdr_csum, which is set
in *gso_segment fucntions to indicate that a tunnel protocol needs
checksum calculation
