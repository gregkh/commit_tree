irqchip: gic: Fix core ID calculation when topology is read from DT

Certain GIC implementation, namely those found on earlier, single
cluster, Exynos SoCs, have registers mapped without per-CPU banking,
which means that the driver needs to use different offset for each CPU.

Currently the driver calculates the offset by multiplying value returned
by cpu_logical_map() by CPU offset parsed from DT. This is correct when
CPU topology is not specified in DT and aforementioned function returns
core ID alone. However when DT contains CPU topology, the function
changes to return cluster ID as well, which is non-zero on mentioned
SoCs and so breaks the calculation in GIC driver.

This patch fixes this by masking out cluster ID in CPU offset
calculation so that only core ID is considered. Multi-cluster Exynos
SoCs already have banked GIC implementations, so this simple fix should
be enough.
