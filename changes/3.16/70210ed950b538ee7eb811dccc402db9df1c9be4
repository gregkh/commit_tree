mm/memblock: add physical memory list

Add the physmem list to the memblock structure. This list only exists
if HAVE_MEMBLOCK_PHYS_MAP is selected and contains the unmodified
list of physically available memory. It differs from the memblock
memory list as it always contains all memory ranges even if the
memory has been restricted, e.g. by use of the mem= kernel parameter.
