mm/compaction: do not count migratepages when unnecessary

During compaction, update_nr_listpages() has been used to count remaining
non-migrated and free pages after a call to migrage_pages().  The
freepages counting has become unneccessary, and it turns out that
migratepages counting is also unnecessary in most cases.

The only situation when it's needed to count cc->migratepages is when
migrate_pages() returns with a negative error code.  Otherwise, the
non-negative return value is the number of pages that were not migrated,
which is exactly the count of remaining pages in the cc->migratepages
list.

Furthermore, any non-zero count is only interesting for the tracepoint of
mm_compaction_migratepages events, because after that all remaining
unmigrated pages are put back and their count is set to 0.

This patch therefore removes update_nr_listpages() completely, and changes
the tracepoint definition so that the manual counting is done only when
the tracepoint is enabled, and only when migrate_pages() returns a
negative error code.

Furthermore, migrate_pages() and the tracepoints won't be called when
there's nothing to migrate.  This potentially avoids some wasted cycles
and reduces the volume of uninteresting mm_compaction_migratepages events
where "nr_migrated=0 nr_failed=0".  In the stress-highalloc mmtest, this
was about 75% of the events.  The mm_compaction_isolate_migratepages event
is better for determining that nothing was isolated for migration, and
this one was just duplicating the info.
