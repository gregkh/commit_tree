uprobes/x86: Add is_64bit_mm(), kill validate_insn_bits()

1. Extract the ->ia32_compat check from 64bit validate_insn_bits()
   into the new helper, is_64bit_mm(), it will have more users.

   TODO: this checks is actually wrong if mm owner is X32 task,
   we need another fix which changes set_personality_ia32().

   TODO: even worse, the whole 64-or-32-bit logic is very broken
   and the fix is not simple, we need the nontrivial changes in
   the core uprobes code.

2. Kill validate_insn_bits() and change its single caller to use
   uprobe_init_insn(is_64bit_mm(mm).
