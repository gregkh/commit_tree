blk-mq: remove blk_mq_wait_for_tags

The current logic for blocking tag allocation is rather confusing, as we
first allocated and then free again a tag in blk_mq_wait_for_tags, just
to attempt a non-blocking allocation and then repeat if someone else
managed to grab the tag before us.

Instead change blk_mq_alloc_request_pinned to simply do a blocking tag
allocation itself and use the request we get back from it.
