x86/efi: Delete most of the efi_call* macros

We really only need one phys and one virt function call, and then only
one assembly function to make firmware calls.

Since we are not using the C type system anyway, we're not really losing
much by deleting the macros apart from no longer having a check that
we are passing the correct number of parameters. The lack of duplicated
code seems like a worthwhile trade-off.
