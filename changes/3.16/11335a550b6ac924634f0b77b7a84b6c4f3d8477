mac80211: implement chanctx reservation

In order to support channel switch with multiple vifs and multiple
contexts, we implement a concept of channel context reservation.  This
allows us to reserve a channel context to be used later.

The reservation functionality is not tied directly to channel switch
and may be used in other situations (eg. reserving a channel context
during IBSS join).

We first check if an existing compatible context exists and if it
does, we reserve it.  If there is no compatible context we create a
new one and reserve it.

Additionally, split ieee80211_vif_copy_chanctx_to_vlans() so we can
call it while already holding the chanctx mutex.
