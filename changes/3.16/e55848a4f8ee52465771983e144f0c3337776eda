uprobes/x86: Conditionalize the usage of handle_riprel_insn()

arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() calls handle_riprel_insn() at the start,
but only "0xff" and "default" cases need the UPROBE_FIX_RIP_ logic.
Move the callsite into "default" case and change the "0xff" case to
fall-through.

We are going to add the various hooks to handle the rip-relative
jmp/call instructions (and more), we need this change to enforce the
fact that the new code can not conflict with is_riprel_insn() logic
which, after this change, can only be used by default_xol_ops.

Note: arch_uprobe_abort_xol() still calls handle_riprel_post_xol()
directly. This is fine unless another _xol_ops we may add later will
need to reuse "UPROBE_FIX_RIP_AX|UPROBE_FIX_RIP_CX" bits in ->fixup.
In this case we can add uprobe_xol_ops->abort() hook, which (perhaps)
we will need anyway in the long term.
