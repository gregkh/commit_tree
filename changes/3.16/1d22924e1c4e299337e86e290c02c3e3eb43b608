ARM: Add platform support for LSI AXM55xx SoC

The AXM55xx family consists of devices that may contain up to 16 ARM Cortex-A15
cores (in a 4x4 cluster configuration). The cores within each cluster share an
L2 cache, and the clusters are connected to each other via a CCN-504 cache
coherent interconnect.

This machine requires CONFIG_ARM_LPAE enabled as all peripherals are located
above 4GB in the memory map.
