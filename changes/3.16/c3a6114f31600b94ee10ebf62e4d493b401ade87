ieee802154: add definitions for link-layer security and header functions

When dealing with 802.15.4, one often has to know the maximum payload
size for a given packet. This depends on many factors, one of which is
whether or not a security header is present in the frame. These
definitions and functions provide an easy way for any upper layer to
calculate the maximum payload size for a packet. The first obvious user
for this is 6lowpan, which duplicates this calculation and gets it
partially wrong because it ignores security headers.
