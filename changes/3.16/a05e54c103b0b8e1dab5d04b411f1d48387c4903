ARM: 8031/2: change fixmap mapping region to support 32 CPUs

In 32-bit ARM systems, the fixmap mapping region can support no more
than 14 CPUs(total: 896k; one CPU: 64K). And we can configure NR_CPUS
up to 32. So there is a mismatch.

This patch moves fixmapping region downwards to region 0xffc00000-
0xffe00000. Then the fixmap mapping region can support up to 32 CPUs.
