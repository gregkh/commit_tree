new helper: generic_file_read_iter()

iov_iter-using variant of generic_file_aio_read().  Some callers
converted.  Note that it's still not quite there for use as ->read_iter() -
we depend on having zero iter->iov_offset in O_DIRECT case.  Fortunately,
that's true for all converted callers (and for generic_file_aio_read() itself).
