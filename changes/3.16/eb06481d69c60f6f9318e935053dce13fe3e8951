6lowpan_rtnl: fix off by one while fragmentation

This patch fix a off by one error while fragmentation. If the frag_cap
value is equal to skb_unprocessed value we need to stop the
fragmentation loop because the last fragment which has a size of
skb_unprocessed fits into the frag capability size.

This issue was introduced by commit d4b2816d67d6e07b2f27037f282d8db03a5829d7
("6lowpan: fix fragmentation").
