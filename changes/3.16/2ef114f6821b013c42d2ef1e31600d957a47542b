[media] v4l: ti-vpe: Add selection API in VPE driver

Add selection ioctl ops. For VPE, cropping makes sense only for the input to
VPE(or V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT/MPLANE buffers) and composing makes sense
only for the output of VPE(or V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE/MPLANE buffers).

For the CAPTURE type, V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE results in VPE writing the output
in a rectangle within the capture buffer. For the OUTPUT type, V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP
results in selecting a rectangle region within the source buffer.

Setting the crop/compose rectangles should successfully result in
re-configuration of registers which are affected when either source or
destination dimensions change, set_srcdst_params() is called for this purpose.
