target: Set CMD_T_ACTIVE bit for Task Management Requests

This patch fixes a bug where se_cmd descriptors associated with a
Task Management Request (TMR) where not setting CMD_T_ACTIVE before
being dispatched into target_tmr_work() process context.

This is required in order for transport_generic_free_cmd() ->
transport_wait_for_tasks() to wait on se_cmd->t_transport_stop_comp
if a session reset event occurs while an ABORT_TASK is outstanding
waiting for another I/O to complete.
