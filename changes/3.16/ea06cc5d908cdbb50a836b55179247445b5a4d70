Revert "[media] media: davinci: vpif_capture: drop unneeded module params"

This patch removes some modprobe parameters, without any reason
or description. I was supposed to not merge this patch, but It
was merged by mistake.

Revert it while nobody provides a good description for such patch.

This reverts commit b952662f272ae43c1583fac4dcda71ef36c33528.
