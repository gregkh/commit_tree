Revert "uio: fix vma io range check in mmap"

This reverts commit ddb09754e6c7239e302c7b675df9bbd415f8de5d.

Linus objected to this originally, I can see why it might be needed, but
given that no one spoke up defending this patch, I'm going to revert it.

If you have hardware that requires this change, please speak up in the
future and defend the patch.
