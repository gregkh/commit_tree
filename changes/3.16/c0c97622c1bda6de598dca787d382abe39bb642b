drm/i915: Use the connector name in fbdev debug messages

During initial probing of the modes to assign to the fbdev console, we
use the CRTC and connector ids. These are much harder for us to
understand than if we used their actual names (or pipe in the CRTC
case). Similarly, we want to manually print the mode size rather than
rely on mode->name being set.
