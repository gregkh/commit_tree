IB/srp: One FMR pool per SRP connection

Allocate one FMR pool per SRP connection instead of one SRP pool
per HCA. This improves scalability of the SRP initiator.

Only request the SCSI mid-layer to retry a SCSI command after a
temporary mapping failure (-ENOMEM) but not after a permanent
mapping failure. This avoids that SCSI commands are retried
indefinitely if a permanent memory mapping failure occurs.

Tell the SCSI mid-layer to reduce queue depth temporarily in the
unlikely case where an application is queuing many requests with
more than max_pages_per_fmr sg-list elements.

For FMR pool allocation, base the max_pages_per_fmr parameter on
the HCA memory registration limit. Only try to allocate an FMR
pool if FMR is supported.
