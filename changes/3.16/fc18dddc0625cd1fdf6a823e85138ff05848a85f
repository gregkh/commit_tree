iio: hid-sensors: Added device rotation support

Added usage id processing for device rotation. This uses IIO
interfaces for triggered buffer to present data to user
mode.This uses HID sensor framework for registering callback
events from the sensor hub.
Data is exported to user space in the form of quaternion rotation
format.
