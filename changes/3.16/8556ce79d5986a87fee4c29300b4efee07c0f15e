net: filter: remove DL macro

Lets get rid of this macro. After commit 5bcfedf06f7f ("net: filter:
simplify label names from jump-table"), labels have become more
readable due to omission of BPF_ prefix but at the same time more
generic, so that things like `git grep -n` would not find them. As
a middle path, lets get rid of the DL macro as it's not strictly
needed and would otherwise just hide the full name.
