rcu: Export debug_init_rcu_head() and and debug_init_rcu_head()

Currently, call_rcu() relies on implicit allocation and initialization
for the debug-objects handling of RCU callbacks.  If you hammer the
kernel hard enough with Sasha's modified version of trinity, you can end
up with the sl*b allocators recursing into themselves via this implicit
call_rcu() allocation.

This commit therefore exports the debug_init_rcu_head() and
debug_rcu_head_free() functions, which permits the allocators to allocated
and pre-initialize the debug-objects information, so that there no longer
any need for call_rcu() to do that initialization, which in turn prevents
the recursion into the memory allocators.
