[media] v4l: vb2: Add a function to discard all DONE buffers

When suspending a device while a video stream is active all buffers
marked as done but not dequeued yet will be kept across suspend and
given back to userspace after resume. This will result in outdated
buffers being dequeued.

Introduce a new vb2 function to mark all done buffers as erroneous
instead, to be used by drivers at resume time.
