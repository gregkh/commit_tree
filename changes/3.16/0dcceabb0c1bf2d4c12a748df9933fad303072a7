net: filter: fix SKF_AD_PKTTYPE extension on big-endian

BPF classic->internal converter broke SKF_AD_PKTTYPE extension, since
pkt_type_offset() was failing to find skb->pkt_type field which is defined as:
__u8 pkt_type:3,
     fclone:2,
     ipvs_property:1,
     peeked:1,
     nf_trace:1;

Fix it by searching for 3 most significant bits and shift them by 5 at run-time
