kprobes/x86: Allow to handle reentered kprobe on single-stepping

Since the NMI handlers(e.g. perf) can interrupt in the
single stepping (or preparing the single stepping, do_debug
etc.), we should consider a kprobe is hit in the NMI
handler. Even in that case, the kprobe is allowed to be
reentered as same as the kprobes hit in kprobe handlers
(KPROBE_HIT_ACTIVE or KPROBE_HIT_SSDONE).

The real issue will happen when a kprobe hit while another
reentered kprobe is processing (KPROBE_REENTER), because
we already consumed a saved-area for the previous kprobe.
