i2c: sh_mobile: fix clock calculation for newer SoCs

Newer SoCs have so fast input clocks that the ICCL/H registers only
count every second clock to have a meaningful 9-bit range. The driver
was already prepared for that happening, but didn't use it so far.
Add the proper DT configuration for SoCs that need it.
