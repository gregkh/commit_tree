perf symbols: Get kernel start address by symbol name

The function machine__get_kernel_start_addr() was taking the first symbol
of kallsyms as the start address. This is incorrect in certain cases
where the first symbol is something at 0, while the actual kernel
functions begin at a later point (e.g. 0x80200000).

This patch fixes machine__get_kernel_start_addr() to search for the
symbol "_text" or "_stext", which marks the beginning of kernel mapping.
This was already being done in machine__create_kernel_maps(). Thus, this
patch is just a refactor, to move that code into
machine__get_kernel_start_addr().
