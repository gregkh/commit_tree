init/main.c: don't use pr_debug()

Pertially revert commit ea676e846a81 ("init/main.c: convert to
pr_foo()").

Unbeknownst to me, pr_debug() is different from the other pr_foo()
levels: pr_debug() is a no-op when DEBUG is not defined.

Happily, init/main.c does have a #define DEBUG so we didn't break
initcall_debug.  But the functioning of initcall_debug should not be
dependent upon the presence of that #define DEBUG.
