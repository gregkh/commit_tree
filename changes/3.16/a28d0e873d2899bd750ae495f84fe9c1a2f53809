wan/x25_asy: integer overflow in x25_asy_change_mtu()

If "newmtu * 2 + 4" is too large then it can cause an integer overflow
leading to memory corruption.  Eric Dumazet suggests that 65534 is a
reasonable upper limit.

Btw, "newmtu" is not allowed to be a negative number because of the
check in dev_set_mtu(), so that's ok.
