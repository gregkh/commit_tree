ARM: 8086/1: Set memblock limit for nommu

Commit 1c2f87c (ARM: 8025/1: Get rid of meminfo) changed find_limits
to use memblock_get_current_limit for calculating the max_low pfn.
nommu targets never actually set a limit on memblock though which
means memblock_get_current_limit will just return the default
value. Set the memblock_limit to be the end of DDR to make sure
bounds are calculated correctly.
