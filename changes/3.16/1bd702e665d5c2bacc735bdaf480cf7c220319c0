tools: cpu-hotplug fix unexpected operator error

on-off-test uses "$UID != 0" to test for root, but $UID is a construct
specific to bash.  Using /bin/sh that isn't bash results in the
following error (due to the "$UID" part expanding to nothing):

  ./on-off-test.sh: 9: [: !=: unexpected operator

Change Makefile to use bash instead.
