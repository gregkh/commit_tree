firewire: ohci: enable MSI for VIA VT6315 rev 1, drop cycle timer quirk

Commit af0cdf494781 "firewire: ohci: fix regression with VIA VT6315,
disable MSI" acted upon a report against VT6315 rev 0:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2010-12/msg02301.html
$ lspci -nn
VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6315 Series Firewire Controller [1106:3403]

I now got a card with
$ lspci -nn
VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6315 Series Firewire Controller [1106:3403] (rev 01)
and this works fine with MSI enabled.

Second, I tested this VT6315 rev 1 without CYCLE_TIMER quirk flag using
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/utils/test_cycle_time_v20100125.c
and found that this chip does in fact access the cycle timer atomically.

Things I can't test because I don't have the hardware:
  - whether VT6315 rev 0 really needs QUIRK_CYCLE_TIMER,
  - whether the VT6320 PCI device needs QUIRK_CYCLE_TIMER,
  - whether the VT6325 and VT6330 PCIe devices need QUIRK_CYCLE_TIMER
    and QUIRK_NO_MSI.

Hence, just add a whitelist entry specifically for VT6315 rev >= 1
without any quirk flags.  Before this entry we need an extra entry to
catch VT6315 rev <= 0 due to how our ID matching logic works.
