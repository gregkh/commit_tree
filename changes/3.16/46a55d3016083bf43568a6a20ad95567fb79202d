drm/i915: Wait for pending page flips before enabling/disabling the primary plane

We have to write to the primary plane base address registrer when we
enable/disable the primary plane in response to sprite coverage. Those
writes will cause the flip counter to increment which could interfere
with the detection of CS flip completion. We could end up completing
CS flips before the CS has even executed the commands from the ring.

To avoid such issues, wait for CS flips to finish before we toggle the
primary plane on/off.

v2: Rebased due to atomic sprite update changes
