mm/vmscan.c: use DIV_ROUND_UP for calculation of zone's balance_gap and correct comments.

Currently, we use (zone->managed_pages + KSWAPD_ZONE_BALANCE_GAP_RATIO-1)
/ KSWAPD_ZONE_BALANCE_GAP_RATIO to avoid a zero gap value.  It's better to
use DIV_ROUND_UP macro for neater code and clear meaning.

Besides, the gap value is calculated against the per-zone "managed pages",
not "present pages".  This patch also corrects the comment and do some
rephrasing.
