mm, fs: Add vm_ops->name as an alternative to arch_vma_name

arch_vma_name sucks.  It's a silly hack, and it's annoying to
implement correctly.  In fact, AFAICS, even the straightforward x86
implementation is incorrect (I suspect that it breaks if the vdso
mapping is split or gets remapped).

This adds a new vm_ops->name operation that can replace it.  The
followup patches will remove all uses of arch_vma_name on x86,
fixing a couple of annoyances in the process.
