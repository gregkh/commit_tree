powerpc/powernv: Enable POWER8 doorbell IPIs

This patch enables POWER8 doorbell IPIs on powernv.

Since doorbells can only IPI within a core, we test to see when we can use
doorbells and if not we fall back to XICS.  This also enables hypervisor
doorbells to wakeup us up from nap/sleep via the LPCR PECEDH bit.

Based on tests by Anton, the best case IPI latency between two threads dropped
from 894ns to 512ns.
