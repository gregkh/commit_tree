ARM: stih41x: Rename stih416-b2020-revE.dts to stih416-b2020e.dts

Two reasons for this rename.  Firstly, it removes the camel case
convention which isn't used by any other platform and secondly it
matches the naming convention for the internal kernel, which can
become annoying when flipping between the two.
