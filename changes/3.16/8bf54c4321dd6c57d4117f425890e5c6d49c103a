[media] mt9p031: Really disable Black Level Calibration in test pattern mode

The digital side of the Black Level Calibration (BLC) function must be
disabled when generating a test pattern to avoid artifacts in the image.
The driver disables BLC correctly at the hardware level, but the feature
gets reenabled by v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup() the next time the device is
powered on.

Fix this by marking the BLC controls as inactive when generating a test
pattern, and ignoring control set requests on inactive controls.
