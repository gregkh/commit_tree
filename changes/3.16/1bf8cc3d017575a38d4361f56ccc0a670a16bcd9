cpufreq: cpu0: OPPs can be populated at runtime

OPPs can be populated statically, via DT, or added at run time with
dev_pm_opp_add().

While this driver handles the first case correctly, it would fail to populate
OPPs added at runtime. Because call to of_init_opp_table() would fail as there
are no OPPs in DT and probe will return early.

To fix this, remove error checking and call dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table()
unconditionally.

Update bindings as well.
