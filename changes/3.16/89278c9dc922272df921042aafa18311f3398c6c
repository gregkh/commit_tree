tcp: simplify fast open cookie processing

Consolidate various cookie checking and generation code to simplify
the fast open processing. The main goal is to reduce code duplication
in tcp_v4_conn_request() for IPv6 support.

Removes two experimental sysctl flags TFO_SERVER_ALWAYS and
TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_CHKD used primarily for developmental debugging
purposes.
