powerpc: Fix bugs in emulate_step()

This fixes some bugs in emulate_step().  First, the setting of the carry
bit for the arithmetic right-shift instructions was not correct on 64-bit
machines because we were masking with a mask of type int rather than
unsigned long.  Secondly, the sld (shift left doubleword) instruction was
using the wrong instruction field for the register containing the shift
count.
