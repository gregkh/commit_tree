printk: split message size computation

We will want to recompute the message size when shrinking too long
messages.  Let's put the code into separate function.

The side effect of setting "pad_len" is not nice but it is worth removing
the code duplication.  Note that I will probably have one more usage for
this function when handling messages safe way in NMI context.

This patch does not change the existing behavior.
