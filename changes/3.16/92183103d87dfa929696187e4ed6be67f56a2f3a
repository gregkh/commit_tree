ARM: 8084/1: sa1100: collie: revert back to cfi_probe

Reverts commit d26b17edafc45187c30cae134a5e5429d58ad676
ARM: sa1100: collie.c: fall back to jedec_probe flash detection

Unfortunately the detection was challenged on the defective unit used for tests:
one of the NOR chips did not respond to the CFI query.
Moreover that bad device needed extra delays on erase-suspend/resume cycles.

Tested personally on 3 different units and with feedback of two other users.
