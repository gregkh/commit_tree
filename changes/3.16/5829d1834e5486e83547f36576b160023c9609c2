drm: rip out dev->devname

This was only ever used to pretty-print the irq driver name. And on
kms systems due to set_version bonghits we never set up the prettier
name, ever. Which make this a bit pointless.

Also, we can always dig out the driver-instance/irq relationship
through other means, so this isn't that useful. So just rip it out to
simplify the set_version/set_busid insanity a bit.

Also delete the temporary busname from drm_pci_set_busid, it's now
unused.

v2: Rebase on top of the new host1x drm_bus for tegra.
