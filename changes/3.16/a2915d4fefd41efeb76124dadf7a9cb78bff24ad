ASoC: CS42L51 and WM8962 codecs depend on INPUT

Building ARM randconfig got into a situation where CONFIG_INPUT
is turned off and SND_SOC_ALL_CODECS is turned on, which failed
for two codecs trying to use the input subsystem. Some other
drivers also select one of these codecs and consequently need an
explicit dependency added.

Appending to the dependency list seems the easiest way out,
since this is not a practical limitation. If anyone really
needs to build these codecs for a kernel with no input support,
a more sophisticated solution can be implemented.
