x86: Implement arch_setup/teardown_hwirq()

This is just a cleanup to get rid of the create/destroy_irq variants
which were designed in hell.

The long term solution for x86 is to switch over to irq domains and
cleanup the whole vector allocation mess.

The generic irq_alloc_hwirqs() interface deliberately prevents
multi-MSI vector allocation to further enforce the irq domain
conversion (aside of the desire to support ioapic hotplug).
