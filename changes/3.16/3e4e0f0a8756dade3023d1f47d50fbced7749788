initramfs: remove "compression mode" choice

Commit 9ba4bcb64589 ("initramfs: read CONFIG_RD_ variables for initramfs
compression") removed the users of the various INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_*
Kconfig symbols.  So since v3.13 the entire "Built-in initramfs
compression mode" choice is a set of knobs connected to nothing.  The
entire choice can safely be removed.
