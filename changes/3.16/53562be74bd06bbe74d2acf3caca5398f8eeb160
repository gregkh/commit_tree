NVMe: Flush with data support

It is possible a filesystem may send a flush flagged bio with write
data. There is no such composite NVMe command, so the driver sends flush
and write separately.

The device is allowed to execute these commands in any order, so it was
possible the driver ends the bio after the write completes, but while the
flush is still active. We don't want to let a filesystem believe flush
succeeded before it really has; this could cause data corruption on a
power loss between these events. To fix, this patch splits the flush
and write into chained bios.
