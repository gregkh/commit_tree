rcu: Make large and small sysidle systems use same state machine

Currently, small systems move back into RCU_SYSIDLE_NOT from
RCU_SYSIDLE_SHORT and large systems do not.  This works because moving
aggressively to RCU_SYSIDLE_NOT affects only performance, not correctness,
and on small systems, the performance impact should be negligible.  That
said, this difference does make RCU a bit more complex, and RCU does not
seem to be suffering from any lack of complexity.  This commit therefore
adjusts small-system operation to match that of large systems, so that
the state never moves back to RCU_SYSIDLE_NOT from RCU_SYSIDLE_SHORT.
