ARM: mvebu: coherency: fix registration of PCI bus notifier when !PCI

Commit b0063aad5dd8 ("ARM: mvebu: use hardware I/O coherency also for
PCI devices") added a reference to the pci_bus_type variable, but this
variable is only available when CONFIG_PCI is enabled. Therefore,
there is now a build failure in !CONFIG_PCI situations.

This commit fixes that by enclosing the entire initcall into a
IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PCI) condition.
