fanotify: FAN_MARK_FLUSH: avoid having to provide a fake/invalid fd and path

Originally from Tvrtko Ursulin (https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/1/12/112)

Avoid having to provide a fake/invalid fd and path when flushing marks

Currently for a group to flush marks it has set it needs to provide a
fake or invalid (but resolvable) file descriptor and path when calling
fanotify_mark.  This patch pulls the flush handling a bit up so file
descriptor and path are completely ignored when flushing.

I reworked the patch to be applicable again (the signature of
fanotify_mark has changed since Tvrtko's work).
