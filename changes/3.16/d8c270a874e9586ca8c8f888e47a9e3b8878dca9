ARM: OMAP: omap3stalker: remove two Kconfig macros

Checks for CONFIG_OMAP2_VENC_OUT_TYPE_SVIDEO and
CONFIG_OMAP2_VENC_OUT_TYPE_COMPOSITE were added in v2.6.35. But the
related Kconfig symbols have never been added to the tree. Remove these
checks.

Initialize connector_type to OMAP_DSS_VENC_TYPE_COMPOSITE explicitly.
That's what's happening currently: OMAP_DSS_VENC_TYPE_COMPOSITE equals
zero and connector_type remains zero since both checks currently fail.
