all: LLVMLinux: Change DWARF flag to support gcc and clang

Both gcc (well, actually gnu as) and clang support the "-Wa,-gdwarf-2" option
(though clang does not support "-Wa,--gdwarf-2"). Since these flags are equivalent
in meaning, this patch uses the one which is better supported across compilers.
