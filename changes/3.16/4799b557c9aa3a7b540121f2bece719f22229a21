KVM: s390: convert handle_tpi()

Convert handle_tpi() to new guest access functions.

The code now sets up a structure which is copied with a single call to
guest space instead of issuing several separate guest access calls.
This is necessary since the to be copied data may cross a page boundary.
If a protection exception happens while accessing any of the pages, the
instruction is suppressed and may not have modified any memory contents.
