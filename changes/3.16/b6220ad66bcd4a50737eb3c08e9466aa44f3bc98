sched: Fix compiler warnings

Commit 143e1e28cb (sched: Rework sched_domain topology definition)
introduced a number of functions with a return value of 'const int'.
gcc doesn't know what to do with that and, if the kernel is compiled
with W=1, complains with the following warnings whenever sched.h
is included.

  include/linux/sched.h:875:25: warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type
  include/linux/sched.h:882:25: warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type
  include/linux/sched.h:889:25: warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type
  include/linux/sched.h:1002:21: warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type

Commits fb2aa855 (sched, ARM: Create a dedicated scheduler topology table)
and 607b45e9a (sched, powerpc: Create a dedicated topology table) introduce
the same warning in the arm and powerpc code.

Drop 'const' from the function declarations to fix the problem.

The fix for all three patches has to be applied together to avoid
compilation failures for the affected architectures.
