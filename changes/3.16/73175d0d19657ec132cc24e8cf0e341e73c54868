uprobes/x86: Add uprobe_init_insn(), kill validate_insn_{32,64}bits()

validate_insn_32bits() and validate_insn_64bits() are very similar,
turn them into the single uprobe_init_insn() which has the additional
"bool x86_64" argument which can be passed to insn_init() and used to
choose between good_insns_64/good_insns_32.

Also kill UPROBE_FIX_NONE, it has no users.

Note: the current code doesn't use ifdef's consistently, good_insns_64
depends on CONFIG_X86_64 but good_insns_32 is unconditional. This patch
removes ifdef around good_insns_64, we will add it back later along with
the similar one for good_insns_32.
