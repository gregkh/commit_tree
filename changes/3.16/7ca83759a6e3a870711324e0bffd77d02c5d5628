staging: r8188eu: Fix some sparse warnings

In a patch entitles "staging: r8188eu: Fix case where ethtype was never obtained
and always be checked against 0" (commit ID unknown), I introduce an endian error.
This patch fixes that, and removes two additional sparse warnings.

drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c:653:6: warning: symbol 'process_pwrbit_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c:1828:5: warning: symbol 'enqueue_reorder_recvframe' was not declared. Should it be static?
