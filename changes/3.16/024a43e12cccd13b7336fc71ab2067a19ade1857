drm/i915: Move ring_begin to signal()

Add_request has always contained both the semaphore mailbox updates as
well as the breadcrumb writes. Since the semaphore signal is the one
which actually knows about the number of dwords it needs to emit to the
ring, we move the ring_begin to that function. This allows us to remove
the hideously shared #define

On a related not, gen8 will use a different number of dwords for
semaphores, but not for add request.

v2: Make number of dwords an explicit part of signalling (via function
argument). (Chris)

v3: very slight comment change
