ptp: validate the requested frequency adjustment.

PTP Hardware Clock drivers specify a maximum frequency adjustment that
their clocks can accommodate. Normally, user space programs will want to
respect the advertised limits. However, no kernel or driver code checks
that the dialed frequency offset is within the bounds, and out of range
values can lead to surprising results.

This patch fixes the issue by rejecting bad values.
