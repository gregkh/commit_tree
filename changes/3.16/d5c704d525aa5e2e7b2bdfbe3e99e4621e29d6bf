MIPS: KVM: Remove ifdef DEBUG around kvm_debug

kvm_debug() uses pr_debug() which is already compiled out in the absence
of a DEBUG define, so remove the unnecessary ifdef DEBUG lines around
kvm_debug() calls which are littered around arch/mips/kvm/.

As well as generally cleaning up, this prevents future bit-rot due to
DEBUG not being commonly used.
