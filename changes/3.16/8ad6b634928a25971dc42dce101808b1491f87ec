KVM: Add KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT to user space API header

Currently, we don't have an exit reason to notify user space about
a system-level event (for e.g. system reset or shutdown) triggered
by the VCPU. This patch adds exit reason KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT for
this purpose. We can also inform user space about the 'type' and
architecture specific 'flags' of a system-level event using the
kvm_run structure.

This newly added KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT will be used by KVM ARM/ARM64
in-kernel PSCI v0.2 support to reset/shutdown VMs.
