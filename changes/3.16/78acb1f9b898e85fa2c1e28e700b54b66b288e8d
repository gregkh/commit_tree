tipc: add ioctl to fetch link names

We add a new ioctl for AF_TIPC that can be used to fetch the
logical name for a link to a remote node on a given bearer. This
should be used in combination with link state subscriptions.
The logical name size limit definitions are moved to tipc.h, as
they are now also needed by the new ioctl.
