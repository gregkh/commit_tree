kernel/printk: use symbolic defines for console loglevels

... instead of naked numbers.

Stuff in sysrq.c used to set it to 8 which is supposed to mean above
default level so set it to DEBUG instead as we're terminating/killing all
tasks and we want to be verbose there.

Also, correct the check in x86_64_start_kernel which should be >= as
we're clearly issuing the string there for all debug levels, not only
the magical 10.
