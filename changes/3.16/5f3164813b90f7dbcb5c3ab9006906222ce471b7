Btrfs: fix race between balance recovery and root deletion

Balance recovery is called when RW mounting or remounting from
RO to RW, it is called to finish roots merging.

When doing balance recovery, relocation root's corresponding
fs root(whose root refs is 0) might be destroyed by cleaner
thread, this will make btrfs fail to mount.

Fix this problem by holding @cleaner_mutex when doing balance
recovery.
