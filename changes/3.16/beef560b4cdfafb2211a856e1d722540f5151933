s390/uaccess: simplify control register updates

Always switch to the kernel ASCE in switch_mm. Load the secondary
space ASCE in finish_arch_post_lock_switch after checking that
any pending page table operations have completed. The primary
ASCE is loaded in entry[64].S. With this the update_primary_asce
call can be removed from the switch_to macro and from the start
of switch_mm function. Remove the load_primary argument from
update_user_asce/clear_user_asce, rename update_user_asce to
set_user_asce and rename update_primary_asce to load_kernel_asce.
