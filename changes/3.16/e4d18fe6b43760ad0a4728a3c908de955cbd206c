staging: comedi: pcl816: use comedi_fc helpers to validate timer arg

Use the comedi_fc helper cfc_check_trigger_arg_is() to validate the
trigger argument when the source is TRIG_TIMER.

The minimum test is not needed, this was already validated in Step 3.

All the arguments are unsigned int, change the local variable to an
unsigned int and rename it for aesthetic reasons.
