KVM: async_pf: kill the unnecessary use_mm/unuse_mm async_pf_execute()

async_pf_execute() has no reasons to adopt apf->mm, gup(current, mm)
should work just fine even if current has another or NULL ->mm.

Recently kvm_async_page_present_sync() was added insedie the "use_mm"
section, but it seems that it doesn't need current->mm too.
