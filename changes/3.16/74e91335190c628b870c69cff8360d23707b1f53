MIPS: PM: Implement PM helper macros

Implement assembler helper macros in asm/pm.h for platform code to use
for saving context across low power states - for example suspend to RAM
or powered down cpuidle states. Macros are provided for saving and
restoring the main CPU context used by C code and doing important
configuration which must be done very early during resume. Notably EVA
needs segmentation control registers to be restored before the stack or
dynamically allocated memory is accessed, so that state is saved in
global data.
