openvswitch: Build flow cmd netlink reply only if needed.

Use netlink_has_listeners() and NLM_F_ECHO flag to determine if a
reply is needed or not for OVS_FLOW_CMD_NEW, OVS_FLOW_CMD_SET, or
OVS_FLOW_CMD_DEL.  Currently, OVS userspace does not request a reply
for OVS_FLOW_CMD_NEW, but usually does for OVS_FLOW_CMD_DEL, as stats
may have changed.
