USB: cdc-acm: fix write and resume race

Fix race between write() and resume() due to improper locking that could
lead to writes being reordered.

Resume must be done atomically and susp_count be protected by the
write_lock in order to prevent racing with write(). This could otherwise
lead to writes being reordered if write() grabs the write_lock after
susp_count is decremented, but before the delayed urb is submitted.

that support remote wakeup")
