staging: rtl8821ae: fix not declared symbols should be static in sw.c

This commit fixes the following sparse warnings:

drivers/staging/rtl8821ae/rtl8821ae/sw.c:
    - 48:6: warning: symbol 'rtl8821ae_init_aspm_vars' was not declared.
      Should it be static?
    - 228:5: warning: symbol 'rtl8812ae_rx_command_packet_handler' was
      not declared. Should it be static?
    - 263:20: warning: symbol 'rtl8821ae_hal_ops' was not declared.
      Should it be static?
    - 314:23: warning: symbol 'rtl8821ae_mod_params' was not declared.
      Should it be static?
    - 321:20: warning: symbol 'rtl8821ae_hal_cfg' was not declared.
      Should it be static?

All of this symbols are local, that is there are no references to them
in the other files from this driver.
