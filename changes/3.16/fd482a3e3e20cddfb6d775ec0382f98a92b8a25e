regulator: core: Disable unused regulators after deferred probing is done

regulator_init_complete does a scan of regulators which dont have
always-on or consumers are automatically disabled as being unused.
However, with deferred probing, late_initcall() is too soon to
declare a regulator as unused as the regulator itself might not
have registered due to defferal - Example: A regulator deffered due
to i2bus not available which in turn is deffered due to pinctrl
availability.

Since deferred probing is done in late_initcall(), do the cleanup of
unused regulators by regulator_init_complete in late_initcall_sync
instead of late_initcall.
