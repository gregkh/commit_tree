ASoC: Add snd_soc_kcontrol_codec() helper function

For CODEC controls snd_kcontrol_chip() currently returns a pointer to the
CODEC that registered the control. With the upcoming consolidation of
platform and CODEC controls this will change. Prepare for this by introducing
the snd_soc_kcontrol_codec() helper function that will hide the implementation
details of how the CODEC for a control can be obtained. This will allow us to
change this easily in the future.

The patch also updates all CODEC drivers to use the new helper function.
