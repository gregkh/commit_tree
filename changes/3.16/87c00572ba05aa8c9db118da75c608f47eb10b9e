kvm: x86: emulate monitor and mwait instructions as nop

Treat monitor and mwait instructions as nop, which is architecturally
correct (but inefficient) behavior. We do this to prevent misbehaving
guests (e.g. OS X <= 10.7) from crashing after they fail to check for
monitor/mwait availability via cpuid.

Since mwait-based idle loops relying on these nop-emulated instructions
would keep the host CPU pegged at 100%, do NOT advertise their presence
via cpuid, to prevent compliant guests from using them inadvertently.
