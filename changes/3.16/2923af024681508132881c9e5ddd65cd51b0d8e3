ASoC: Add ADAU1381/ADAU1781 audio CODEC support

This patch adds support for the Analog Devices ADAU1381 and ADAU1781 audio
CODECs. The device is a low-power, 24-bit stereo audio CODEC with multiple
analog inputs and outputs, two digital microphone inputs and an I2S interface.
The device can be controlled either using I2C or SPI. The main difference
between the two variants is that the ADAU1781 has a freely programmable SigmaDSP
processor, while the ADAU1381 has a fixed function wind noise reduction filter.
