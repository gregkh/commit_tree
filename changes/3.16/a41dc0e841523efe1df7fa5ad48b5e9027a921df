arm64: Implement cache_line_size() based on CTR_EL0.CWG

The hardware provides the maximum cache line size in the system via the
CTR_EL0.CWG bits. This patch implements the cache_line_size() function
to read such information, together with a sanity check if the statically
defined L1_CACHE_BYTES is smaller than the hardware value.
