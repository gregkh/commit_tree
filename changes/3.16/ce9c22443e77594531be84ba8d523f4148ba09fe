[media] vb2: fix compiler warning

When compiling this for older kernels using the compatibility build
the compiler complains about uninitialized variables:

While these warnings are bogus (the call to __find_plane_by_offset will
set buffer and plane), it doesn't hurt to initialize these variables.
