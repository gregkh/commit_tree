tracing: Remove mock up poll wait function

Now that the ring buffer has a built in way to wake up readers
when there's data, using irq_work such that it is safe to do it
in any context. But it was still using the old "poor man's"
wait polling that checks every 1/10 of a second to see if it
should wake up a waiter. This makes the latency for a wake up
excruciatingly long. No need to do that anymore.

Completely remove the different wait_poll types from the tracers
and have them all use the default one now.
