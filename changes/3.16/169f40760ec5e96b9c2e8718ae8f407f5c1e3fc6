i40evf: fix panic on PF driver fail

Fix a panic that would occur in the VF if the PF driver failed or was
removed from the host kernel. In this case, the VF driver calls
i40evf_close(), but this function does nothing because the driver is in
the resetting state. Because of this, the driver doesn't free its irqs
and causes a kernel panic when it tries to disable MSI-X.
