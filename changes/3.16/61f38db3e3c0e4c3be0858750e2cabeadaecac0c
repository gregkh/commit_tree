rcu: Provide API to suppress stall warnings while sysrc runs

Some sysrq handlers can run for a long time, because they dump a lot
of data onto a serial console. Having RCU stall warnings pop up in
the middle of them only makes the problem worse.

This commit provides rcu_sysrq_start() and rcu_sysrq_end() APIs to
temporarily suppress RCU CPU stall warnings while a sysrq request is
handled.
