m68k: Toward platform agnostic framebuffer debug logging

Code subject to #ifdef CONSOLE is made more generic, as was apparently
intended by the original author.

Remove console_put_stats() routine. If it should be somehow useful, it
should also be useful on platforms without framebuffer debug logging. The
present implementation is only built #if defined CONFIG_MAC && defined
CONSOLE even though puts() works everywhere.
