KVM: s390: extract irq parameters of intercepted program irqs

Whenever a program interrupt is intercepted, some parameters are stored in the
sie control block. These parameters have to be extracted in order to be
reinjected correctly. This patch also takes care of intercepted PER events which
can occurr in addition to any program interrupt.
