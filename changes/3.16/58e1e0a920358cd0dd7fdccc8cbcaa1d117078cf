NFC: st21nfca: Implement load_session HCI hook

This implementation rely on the ST21NFCA_DEVICE_MGNT_GATE and
ST21NFCA_DM_GETINFO proprietary gates commands.

First we are retrieving a pipe list available on the CLF with the
ST21NFCA_DM_GETINFO_PIPE_LIST parameter. A gate<->pipe table match
is done with ST21NFCA_DM_GETINFO_PIPE_INFO for each pipe.
If the pipe is created and open, we fill st21nfca_gates table.
If the pipe is create but closed or is not created we keep the gate
with NFC_HCI_INVALID_PIPE.
