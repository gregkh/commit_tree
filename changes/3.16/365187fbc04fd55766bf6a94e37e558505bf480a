rcu: Update cpu_needs_another_gp() for futures from non-NOCB CPUs

In the old days, the only source of requests for future grace periods
was NOCB CPUs.  This has changed: CPUs routinely post requests for
future grace periods in order to promote power efficiency and reduce
OS jitter with minimal impact on grace-period latency.  This commit
therefore updates cpu_needs_another_gp() to invoke rcu_future_needs_gp()
instead of rcu_nocb_needs_gp().  The latter is no longer used, so is
now removed.  This commit also adds tracing for the irq_work_queue()
wakeup case.
