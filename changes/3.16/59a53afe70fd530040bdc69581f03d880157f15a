powerpc: Don't setup CPUs with bad status

OPAL will mark a CPU that is guarded as "bad" in the status property of the CPU
node.

Unfortunatley Linux doesn't check this property and will put the bad CPU in the
present map.  This has caused hangs on booting when we try to unsplit the core.

This patch checks the CPU is avaliable via this status property before putting
it in the present map.
