ceph: handle cap import atomically

cap import messages are processed by both handle_cap_import() and
handle_cap_grant(). These two functions are not executed in the same
atomic context, so they can races with cap release.

The fix is make handle_cap_import() not release the i_ceph_lock when
it returns. Let handle_cap_grant() release the lock after it finishes
its job.
