powerpc/eeh: Use cached capability for log dump

When calling into eeh_gather_pci_data() on pSeries platform, we
possiblly don't have pci_dev instance yet, but eeh_dev is always
ready. So we use cached capability from eeh_dev instead of pci_dev
for log dump there. In order to keep things unified, we also cache
PCI capability positions to eeh_dev for PowerNV as well.
