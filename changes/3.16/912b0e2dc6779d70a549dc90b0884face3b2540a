drm/i915/dvo: Remove ->mode_set callback

Currently for the i9xx crtc hooks there's nothing between the call to
encoder->mode_set and encoder->pre_enable which touches the hardware.

Therefore, since dvo is only used on gen2, we can just move the hook.
Yay for easy cases!

The only other important thing to check is that the new
->pre_enable hook is idempotent wrt the sw state since now it can be
called multiple times (due to DPMS). It only reads crtc->config but
otherwise leaves it as-is, so we're good.
