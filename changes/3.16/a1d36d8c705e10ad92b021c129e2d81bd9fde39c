[media] videobuf2-core: fix sparse errors

Sparse generated a bunch of errors like this:

These are caused by the call*op defines which do something like this:

        (ops->op) ? ops->op(args) : 0

which is OK as long as op is not a void function, because in that case one part
of the conditional expression returns void, the other an integer. Hence the sparse
errors.

I've replaced this by introducing three variants of the call_ macros:
call_*op for int returns, call_void_*op for void returns and call_ptr_*op for
pointer returns.

That's the bad news. The good news is that the fail_*op macros could be removed
since the call_*op macros now have enough information to determine if the op
succeeded or not and can increment the op counter only on success. This at least
makes it more robust w.r.t. future changes.
