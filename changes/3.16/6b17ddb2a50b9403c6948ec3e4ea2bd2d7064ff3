intel_pstate: Remove sample parameter in intel_pstate_calc_busy

Since commit d37e2b7644 ("intel_pstate: remove unneeded sample buffers")
we use only one sample. So, there is no need to pass the sample
pointer to intel_pstate_calc_busy. Instead, get the pointer from
cpudata. Also, remove the unused SAMPLE_COUNT macro.

While at it, reformat the first line in this function.
