ARM: kirkwood: Move NSA310 common parts to include file

 Move definitions that are common to both nsa-310.dts and
 nsa310a.dts and that will also be used in nsa320 into
 kirkwood-nsa310-common.dtsi. Also rename the USB
 Regulator to remove the word off from its name as the
 state of a regulator shouldn't be part of its name.
