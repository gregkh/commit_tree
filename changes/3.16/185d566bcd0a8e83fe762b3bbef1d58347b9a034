checkpatch: fix wildcard DT compatible string checking

We attempt to search for compatible strings which use a variable token in
the documented name such as <chip> or <soc>.  While this was attempted to
be handled, it's utterly broken.

The desired forms of matching are:

vendor,<chip>-*
vendor,name<part#>-*

For <chip>, lower case characters and numbers are permitted.  For <part#>,
only numeric values are allowed.

With this change, the number of missing compatible strings reported in
arch/arm/boot/dts is reduced from 1071 to 960.
