KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: PAPR: Access RTAS in big endian

When the guest does an RTAS hypercall it keeps all RTAS variables inside a
big endian data structure.

To make sure we don't have to bother about endianness inside the actual RTAS
handlers, let's just convert the whole structure to host endian before we
call our RTAS handlers and back to big endian when we return to the guest.
