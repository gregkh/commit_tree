mmc: sdhci-msm: Fix fallout from sdhci refactoring

The sdhci core was refactored recently and some of those
refactorings required changes in every sdhci platform driver.
Those updates happened around the same time as when the msm
driver was merged so the refactorings missed the msm driver.
Hook in the basic library functions so that we can boot apq8074
dragonboards again instead of crashing when we try to jump to
NULL function pointers.
