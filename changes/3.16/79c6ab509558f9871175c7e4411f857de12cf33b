clk: divider: add CLK_DIVIDER_READ_ONLY flag

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>

Similar to muxes which already have a read-only flag there sometimes
exist dividers which should not be changed by the clock framework
but whose value still should be readable.

Therefore add a READ_ONLY flag similar to the mux-one to clk-divider
