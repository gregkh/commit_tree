NFC: trf7970a: Set correct Vin voltage in Chip Status Control register

Currently, the trf7970a driver assumes that the Vin voltage is 5V when
it writes to the 'Chip Status Control' register. That may not be correct
so use the regulator facility to get the Vin voltage and set the VRS5_3
bit correctly when writing to that register.
