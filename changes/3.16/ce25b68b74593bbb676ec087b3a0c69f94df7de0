net: filter: use block statements in tcpdump tests

This patch converts raw opcodes for tcpdump tests into
BPF_STMT()/BPF_JUMP() combinations, which brings it into
conformity with the rest of the patches and it also makes
life easier to grasp what's going on in these particular
test cases when they ever fail. Also arrange payload from
the jump+holes test in a way as we have with other packet
payloads in the test suite.
