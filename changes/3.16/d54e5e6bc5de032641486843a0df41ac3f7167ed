staging: comedi: usbduxsigma: remove 'ao_chanlist' from private data

This member of the private data is just a copy of the channels from
the cmd->chanlist. Remove the member and just use the cmd->chanlist
directly.

Remove the unneeded 'len' local variable in usbduxsigma_ao_urb_complete().
This is just the cmd->chanlist_len.
