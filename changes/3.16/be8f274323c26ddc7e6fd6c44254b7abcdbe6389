kprobes: Prohibit probing on .entry.text code

.entry.text is a code area which is used for interrupt/syscall
entries, which includes many sensitive code.
Thus, it is better to prohibit probing on all of such code
instead of a part of that.
Since some symbols are already registered on kprobe blacklist,
this also removes them from the blacklist.
