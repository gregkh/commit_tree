NFC: digital: SENSF_RES excludes RD when SENSF_REQ RC is zero

The check in digital_tg_send_sensf_res() that excludes
the 'RD' field from the SENSF_RES is inverted.  The 'RD'
field should be excluded when the SENSF_REQ 'RC' field
is equal to DIGITAL_SENSF_REQ_RC_NONE instead of when
its not equal.  This is described in section 6.6.2.11
of the NFC Digital Specification.
