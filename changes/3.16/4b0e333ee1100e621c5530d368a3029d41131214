drm/i915: Always apply cursor width changes

It is possible for userspace to create a big object large enough for a
256x256, and then switch over to using it as a 64x64 cursor. This
requires the cursor update routines to check for a change in width on
every update, rather than just when the cursor is originally enabled.

This also fixes an issue with 845g/865g which cannot change the base
address of the cursor whilst it is active.
