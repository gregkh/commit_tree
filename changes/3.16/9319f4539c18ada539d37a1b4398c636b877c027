kbuild: support simultaneous "make %config" and "make all"

Kbuild is supposed to support mixed targets. (%config and build targets)

But "make all" did nothing if it was run with configuration targets.
For example,

  $ LANG=C make defconfig all
    HOSTCC  scripts/basic/fixdep
    HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/conf.o
    SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c
    SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.lex.c
    SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.hash.c
    HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.o
    HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/conf
  *** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'
  #
  # configuration written to .config
  #
  make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

This commits allows "make %config all" and makes sure
mixed targets are built one by one in the given order.
