unregister_netdevice : move RTM_DELLINK to until after ndo_uninit

This patch fixes ordering of rtnl notifications during unregister_netdevice
by moving RTM_DELLINK notification to until after ndo_uninit.

The problem was seen with unregistering bond netdevices.

bond ndo_uninit callback generates a few RTM_NEWLINK notifications for
NETDEV_CHANGEADDR and NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE. This is seen mostly when the
bond is deleted with slaves still enslaved to the bond.

During unregister netdevice (rollback_registered_many to be specific)
bond ndo_uninit is called after RTM_DELLINK notification goes out.
This results in userspace seeing RTM_DELLINK followed by a couple of
RTM_NEWLINK's.

In userspace problem was seen with libnl. libnl cache deletes the bond
when it sees RTM_DELLINK and re-adds the bond with the following
RTM_NEWLINK. Resulting in a stale bond entry in libnl cache when the kernel
has already deleted the bond.

This patch has been tested for bond, bridges and vlan devices.
