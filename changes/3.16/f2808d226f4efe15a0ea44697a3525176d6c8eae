bridge: Prepare for forwarding another bridge group addresses

If a bridge is an 802.1ad bridge, it must forward another bridge group
addresses (the Nearest Customer Bridge group addresses).
(For details, see IEEE 802.1Q-2011 8.6.3.)

As user might not want group_fwd_mask to be modified by enabling 802.1ad,
introduce a new mask, group_fwd_mask_required, which indicates addresses
the bridge wants to forward. This will be set by enabling 802.1ad.
