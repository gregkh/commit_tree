UBIFS: respect MS_SILENT mount flag

When attempting to mount a non-ubifs formatted volume, lots of error
messages (including a stack dump) are thrown to the kernel log even if
the MS_SILENT mount flag is set.
Fix this by introducing adding an additional state-variable in
struct ubifs_info and suppress error messages in ubifs_read_node if
MS_SILENT is set.
