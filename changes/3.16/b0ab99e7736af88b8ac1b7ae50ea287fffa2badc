sched: Fix possible divide by zero in avg_atom() calculation

proc_sched_show_task() does:

  if (nr_switches)
	do_div(avg_atom, nr_switches);

nr_switches is unsigned long and do_div truncates it to 32 bits, which
means it can test non-zero on e.g. x86-64 and be truncated to zero for
division.

Fix the problem by using div64_ul() instead.

As a side effect calculations of avg_atom for big nr_switches are now correct.
