cgroup: use release_agent_path_lock in cgroup_release_agent_show()

release_path is now protected by release_agent_path_lock to allow
accessing it without grabbing cgroup_mutex; however,
cgroup_release_agent_show() was still grabbing cgroup_mutex.  Let's
convert it to release_agent_path_lock so that we don't have to worry
about this one for the planned locking updates.
