bnx2x: Enlarge the dorq threshold for VFs

A malicious VF might try to starve the other VFs & PF by creating
contineous doorbell floods. In order to negate this, HW has a threshold of
doorbells per client, which will stop the client doorbells from arriving
if crossed.

The threshold currently configured for VFs is too low - under extreme traffic
scenarios, it's possible for a VF to reach the threshold and thus for its
fastpath to stop working.
