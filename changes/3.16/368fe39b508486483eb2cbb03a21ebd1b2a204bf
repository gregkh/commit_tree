NFSD: Don't clear SUID/SGID after root writing data

We're clearing the SUID/SGID bits on write by hand in nfsd_vfs_write,
even though the subsequent vfs_writev() call will end up doing this for
us (through file system write methods eventually calling
file_remove_suid(), e.g., from __generic_file_aio_write).

So, remove the redundant nfsd code.

The only change in behavior is when the write is by root, in which case
we previously cleared SUID/SGID, but will now leave it alone.  The new
behavior is the behavior of every filesystem we've checked.

It seems better to be consistent with local filesystem behavior.  And
the security advantage seems limited as root could always restore these
bits by hand if it wanted.

SUID/SGID is not cleared after writing data with (root, local ext4),
