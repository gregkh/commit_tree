tools: usb: aio example applications

This patch adds two example applications showing usage of Asynchronous I/O API
of FunctionFS. First one (aio_simple) is simple example of bidirectional data
transfer. Second one (aio_multibuff) shows multi-buffer data transfer, which
may to be used in high performance applications.

Both examples contains userspace applications for device and for host.
It needs libaio library on the device, and libusb library on host.
