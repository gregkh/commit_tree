ARM: plat-versatile: convert LEDs to platform device

The LEDs were initialized unconditionally with an fs_initcall()
which doesn't play well with multiplatform. Convert the driver
to a platform device and convert all boards with these LEDs
to register a platform device and pass the register as a
resource instead.

Tested successfully on the Versatile/AB and RealView PB1176.
