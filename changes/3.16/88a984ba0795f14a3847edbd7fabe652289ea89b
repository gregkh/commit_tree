DMA-API: Change dma_declare_coherent_memory() CPU address to phys_addr_t

dma_declare_coherent_memory() takes two addresses for a region of memory: a
"bus_addr" and a "device_addr".  I think the intent is that "bus_addr" is
the physical address a *CPU* would use to access the region, and
"device_addr" is the bus address the *device* would use to address the
region.

Rename "bus_addr" to "phys_addr" and change its type to phys_addr_t.
Most callers already supply a phys_addr_t for this argument.  The others
supply a 32-bit integer (a constant, unsigned int, or __u32) and need no
change.

Use "unsigned long", not phys_addr_t, to hold PFNs.

No functional change (this could theoretically fix a truncation in a config
with 32-bit dma_addr_t and 64-bit phys_addr_t, but I don't think there are
any such cases involving this code).
