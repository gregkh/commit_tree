uwb: fix channel change failure

Make the transition to the UWB_RSV_STATE_NONE state synchronous so that
there is not a race between uwb_rsv_terminate and uwb_rsv_establish.
uwb_rsv_terminate would set the rsv->state to UWB_RSV_STATE_NONE but did
not release the stream resource until a 320ms timeout had expired.  If a
user called uwb_rsv_establish during that time, it could fail to
establish the reservation because no stream resources were available.
This patch removes the timer from the uwb_rsv_terminate process since it
is not needed when transitioning to UWB_RSV_STATE_NONE.
