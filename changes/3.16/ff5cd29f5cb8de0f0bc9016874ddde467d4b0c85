Bluetooth: Store also RSSI for pending advertising reports

Especially in crowded environments it can become frequent that we have
to send out whatever pending event there is stored. Since user space
has its own filtering of small RSSI changes sending a 0 value will
essentially force user space to wake up the higher layers (e.g. over
D-Bus) even though the RSSI didn't actually change more than the
threshold value.

This patch adds storing also of the RSSI for pending advertising reports
so that we report an as accurate RSSI as possible when we have to send
out the stored information to user space.
