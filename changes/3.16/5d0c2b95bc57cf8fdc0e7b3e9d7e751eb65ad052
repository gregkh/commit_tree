net: Preserve CHECKSUM_COMPLETE at validation

Currently when the first checksum in a packet is validated using
CHECKSUM_COMPLETE, ip_summed is overwritten to be CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY
so that any subsequent checksums in the packet are not correctly
validated.

This patch adds csum_valid flag in sk_buff and uses that to indicate
validated checksum instead of setting CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY. The bit
is set accordingly in the skb_checksum_validate_* functions. The flag
is checked in skb_checksum_complete, so that validation is communicated
between checksum_init and checksum_complete sequence in TCP and UDP.
