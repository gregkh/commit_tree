mac80211: protect AP VLAN list with local->mtx

It was impossible to change chanctx of master AP
for AP VLANs because the copy function requires
RTNL which can't be simply taken in mac80211 code
due to possible deadlocks.

This is required for future chanctx reservation
that re-bind vifs to new chanctx. This requires
safe AP VLAN iteration without RTNL.

Now VLANs can be iterated while holding either
RTNL or local->mtx because the list is modified
while holding both of these locks.
