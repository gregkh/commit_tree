DMA: Freescale: remove the unnecessary FSL_DMA_LD_DEBUG

Some codes are calling chan_dbg with FSL_DMA_LD_DEBUG surrounded, it is really
unnecessary to use such a macro because chan_dbg is a wrapper of dev_dbg, we do
have corresponding DEBUG macro to switch on/off dev_dbg, and most of the other
codes are also calling chan_dbg directly without using FSL_DMA_LD_DEBUG.
