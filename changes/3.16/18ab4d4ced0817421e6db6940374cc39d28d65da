swap: change swap_list_head to plist, add swap_avail_head

Originally get_swap_page() started iterating through the singly-linked
list of swap_info_structs using swap_list.next or highest_priority_index,
which both were intended to point to the highest priority active swap
target that was not full.  The first patch in this series changed the
singly-linked list to a doubly-linked list, and removed the logic to start
at the highest priority non-full entry; it starts scanning at the highest
priority entry each time, even if the entry is full.

Replace the manually ordered swap_list_head with a plist, swap_active_head.
Add a new plist, swap_avail_head.  The original swap_active_head plist
contains all active swap_info_structs, as before, while the new
swap_avail_head plist contains only swap_info_structs that are active and
available, i.e. not full.  Add a new spinlock, swap_avail_lock, to protect
the swap_avail_head list.

Mel Gorman suggested using plists since they internally handle ordering
the list entries based on priority, which is exactly what swap was doing
manually.  All the ordering code is now removed, and swap_info_struct
entries and simply added to their corresponding plist and automatically
ordered correctly.

Using a new plist for available swap_info_structs simplifies and
optimizes get_swap_page(), which no longer has to iterate over full
swap_info_structs.  Using a new spinlock for swap_avail_head plist
allows each swap_info_struct to add or remove themselves from the
plist when they become full or not-full; previously they could not
do so because the swap_info_struct->lock is held when they change
from full<->not-full, and the swap_lock protecting the main
swap_active_head must be ordered before any swap_info_struct->lock.
