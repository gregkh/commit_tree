regulator: tps65090: Fix tps65090 crash on Tegra Dalmore

The patch (60e91b5 regulator: tps65090: Allow setting the overcurrent
wait time) introduced a crash on Tegra Dalmore.  On Dalmore the device
tree doesn't have an entry for all of the FETs so it leaves tps_pdata
NULL in some cases.  Add a check for NULL like the rest of the code
does.
