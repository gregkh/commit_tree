ALSA: firewire-lib: Add support for duplex streams synchronization in blocking mode

Generally, the devices can synchronize to handle 'presentation timestamp'
in CIP packets. This commit adds functionality to pick up this timestamp from
in-packets transmitted by the device, then use it for out packets.

In current implementation, this module generated the timestamp by itself. This
is 'SYT Match' mode. Then drivers with this module acts as synchronization
master. This commit allows this module to act as synchronization slave.

This commit restricts this mechanism is only available in blocking mode because
handling the timestamp in non-blocking mode is more complicated than in
blocking mode.
