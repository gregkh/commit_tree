ARM: mvebu: use hardware I/O coherency also for PCI devices

Since the beginning of the introduction of hardware I/O coherency
support for Armada 370 and Armada XP, the special DMA operations
should have applied to all DMA capable devices. Unfortunately, while
the original code properly took into account platform devices, it
didn't take into account PCI devices, which can also be DMA masters.

This commit fixes that by registering a bus notifier on pci_bus_type,
to register our custom DMA operations, like is already done for
platform devices. While doing this, we also rename
mvebu_hwcc_platform_notifier() to mvebu_hwcc_notifier() and
mvebu_hwcc_platform_nb to mvebu_hwcc_nb because they are no longer
specific to platform devices.
