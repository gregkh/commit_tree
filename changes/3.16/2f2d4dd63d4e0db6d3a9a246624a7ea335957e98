ide: Fix CS5520 and CS5530 dependencies

As far as I know, the CS5520 and CS5530 chipsets were only used with
32-bit x86 Geode processors, so I think their drivers are only needed
on this architecture, except for build testing purpose.

While we're here, simplify the dependencies for the CS5535 driver.
