bus: omap_l3_noc: make error reporting and handling common

The logic between handling CUSTOM_ERROR and STANDARD_ERROR is just the
reporting style.

So make it generic, simplify and standardize the reporting with both
master and target information printed to log.

Handle the register address difference for master code for standard
error and custom error as well.

While at it, fix a minor indentation error.
