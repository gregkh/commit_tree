uprobes/x86: move the UPROBE_FIX_{RIP,IP,CALL} code at the end of pre/post hooks

No functional changes. Preparation to simplify the review of the next
change. Just reorder the code in arch_uprobe_pre/post_xol() functions
so that UPROBE_FIX_{RIP_*,IP,CALL} logic goes to the end.

Also change arch_uprobe_pre_xol() to use utask instead of autask, to
make the code more symmetrical with arch_uprobe_post_xol().
