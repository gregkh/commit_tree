x86_64, entry: Merge most 64-bit asm entry macros

I haven't touched the device interrupt code, which is different
enough that it's probably not worth merging, and I haven't done
anything about paranoidzeroentry_ist yet.

This appears to produce an entry_64.o file that differs only in the
debug info line numbers.
