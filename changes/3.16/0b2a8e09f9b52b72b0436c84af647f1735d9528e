drm/i915: Improve gen3/4 frame counter

Currently the logic to fix up the frame counter on gen3/4 assumes that
start of vblank occurs at vblank_start*htotal pixels, when in fact
it occurs htotal-hsync_start pixels earlier. Apply the appropriate
adjustment to make the frame counter more accurate.

Also fix the vblank start position for interlaced display modes.
