ACPI / scan: always register ACPI LPSS scan handler

Prevent platform devices from being created for ACPI LPSS devices
if CONFIG_X86_INTEL_LPSS is unset by compiling out the LPSS scan
handler's callbacks only in that case and still compiling its device
ID list in and registering the scan handler in either case.

This change is based on a prototype from Zhang Rui.
