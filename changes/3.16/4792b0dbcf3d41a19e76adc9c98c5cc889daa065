ASoC: core: Add support for machine specific trigger callback

Machine specific trigger callback allows to do final stream start/stop
related operations in a machine driver after setting up the codec, DMA and
DAI.

One example could be clock management for linked streams case where machine
driver can start/stop synchronously the linked streams.
