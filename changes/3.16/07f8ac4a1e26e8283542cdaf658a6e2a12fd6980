bridge: add export of multicast database adjacent to net_dev

With this new, exported function br_multicast_list_adjacent(net_dev) a
list of IPv4/6 addresses is returned. This list contains all multicast
addresses sensed by the bridge multicast snooping feature on all bridge
ports of the bridge interface of net_dev, excluding addresses from the
specified net_device itself.

Adding bridge support to the batman-adv multicast optimization requires
batman-adv knowing about the existence of bridged-in multicast
listeners to be able to reliably serve them with multicast packets.
