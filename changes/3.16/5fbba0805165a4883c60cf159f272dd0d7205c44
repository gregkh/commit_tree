ARM: mvebu: ARM: mvebu: use of_find_matching_node_and_match() in coherency.c

In the mach-mvebu coherency code, instead of using
of_find_matching_node() and then of_match_node(), directly use the
of_find_matching_node_and_match() which does both at once.

We take this opportunity to also simplify the initialization of the
"type" variable.
