alarmtimer: Fix bug where relative alarm timers were treated as absolute

Sharvil noticed with the posix timer_settime interface, using the
CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM or CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM clockid, if the users
tried to specify a relative time timer, it would incorrectly be
treated as absolute regardless of the state of the flags argument.

This patch corrects this, properly checking the absolute/relative flag,
as well as adds further error checking that no invalid flag bits are set.
