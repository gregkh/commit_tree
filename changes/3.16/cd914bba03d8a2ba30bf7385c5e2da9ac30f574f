drivers/rtc/rtc-omap.c: add support for enabling 32khz clock

Newer versions of OMAP RTC IP such as those found in AM335x and DRA7x
need an explicit enable of 32khz functional clock which ticks the RTC.

AM335x support was working so far because of settings done in U-Boot.
However, the DRA7x U-Boot does no such enable of 32khz clock and this
patch is need to get the RTC to work on DRA7x at least.  In general, it
is better to not depend on settings done in U-Boot.

Thanks to Lokesh Vutla for noticing this.
