ASoC: si476x: Remove the set_cache_io() entirely from ASoC probe.

As we can set the CODEC I/O while snd_soc_register_codec(), so the
calling of set_cache_io() from CODEC ASoC probe could be removed
entirely.

And then we can set the CODEC I/O in the device probe instead of
CODEC ASoC probe as earily as possible.
