ntp: Make is_error_status() use its argument

is_error_status() is an inline function always called with the
global time_status as an argument, so there's zero functional
difference with this change, but the non-CONFIG_NTP_PPS version
uses the passed-in argument, while the CONFIG_NTP_PPS one ignores
its argument and uses the global.

Looks like is_error_status was refactored out, but someone forgot
to change the logic to check the local argument value.

Thus this patch makes it use the argument always; shorter variable
names are good.
