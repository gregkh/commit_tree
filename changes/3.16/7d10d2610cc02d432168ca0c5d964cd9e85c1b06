net: cdc_ncm: fix 64bit division build error

The upper timer_interval limit is arbitrary and much higher
than anything usable in the real world.  Reducing it from 15s
to ~4s to make the timer_interval fit in an u32 does not make
much difference.  The limit is still outside the practical
bounds.

This eliminates the need for a 64bit timer_interval, fixing a
build error related to 64bit division:

 drivers/built-in.o: In function `cdc_ncm_get_coalesce':
 ak8975.c:(.text+0x1ac994): undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'
