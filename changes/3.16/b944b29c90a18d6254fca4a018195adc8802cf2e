ACPICA: Disassembler: Add support to decode _HID and _CID values.

For _HID and _CID, the disassembler will emit a string that describes
the device if the _HID/_CID value is recognized. acpihelp updated also.
acpihelp will now search for a specific ID as well as displaying
the list of "known" (to ACPICA) IDs.

This patch does not affect Linux kernel behavior as the disassembler
and the acpihelp are not shipped with it.
