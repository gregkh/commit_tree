Smack: unify all ptrace accesses in the smack

The decision whether we can trace a process is made in the following
functions:
	smack_ptrace_traceme()
	smack_ptrace_access_check()
	smack_bprm_set_creds() (in case the proces is traced)

This patch unifies all those decisions by introducing one function that
checks whether ptrace is allowed: smk_ptrace_rule_check().

This makes possible to actually trace with TRACEME where first the
TRACEME itself must be allowed and then exec() on a traced process.

Additional bugs fixed:
- The decision is made according to the mode parameter that is now correctly
  translated from PTRACE_MODE_* to MAY_* instead of being treated 1:1.
  PTRACE_MODE_READ requires MAY_READ.
  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH requires MAY_READWRITE.
- Add a smack audit log in case of exec() refused by bprm_set_creds().
- Honor the PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT flag and don't put smack audit info
  in case this flag is set.
