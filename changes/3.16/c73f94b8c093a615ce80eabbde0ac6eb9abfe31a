Bluetooth: Fix locking of hdev when calling into SMP code

The SMP code expects hdev to be unlocked since e.g. crypto functions
will try to (re)lock it. Therefore, we need to release the lock before
calling into smp.c from mgmt.c. Without this we risk a deadlock whenever
the smp_user_confirm_reply() function is called.
