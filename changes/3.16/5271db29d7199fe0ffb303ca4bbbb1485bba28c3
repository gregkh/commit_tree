mfd: cros_ec: Sync to the latest cros_ec_commands.h from EC sources

This just updates include/linux/mfd/cros_ec_commands.h to match the
latest EC version (which is the One True Source for such things).  See
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec>

[dianders: took today's ToT version from the Chromium OS EC; deleted
references to cros_ec_dev and cros_ec_lpc since those aren't upstream
yet]
