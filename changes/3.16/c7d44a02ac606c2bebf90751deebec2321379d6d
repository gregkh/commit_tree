serial_core: Commonalize crlf when working w/ a non open console port

In (efe2f29 kgdboc,kdb: Allow kdb to work on a non open console port)
support was added to directly use the "write_char" functions when
doing kdb over a non-open console port.  This is great, but it ends up
bypassing the normal code in uart_console_write() that adds a carriage
return before any newlines.

There appears to have been a trend to add this support directly in
some console driver's poll_put_char() functions.  This had a few side
effects, including:
- In this case we were doing LFCR, not CRLF.  This was fixed in
  uart_console_write() back in (d358788 [SERIAL] kernel console should
  send CRLF not LFCR)
- Not all serial drivers had the LFCR code in their poll_put_char()
  functions.  In my case I was running serial/samsung.c which lacked
  it.

I've moved the handling to uart_poll_put_char() to fix the above
problems.  Now when I use kdb (and don't point console= to the same
UART) I no longer get:

[0]kdb>
       [0]kdb>
              [0]kdb>
