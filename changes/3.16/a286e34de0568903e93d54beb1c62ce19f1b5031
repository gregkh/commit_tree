staging: slicoss: fix multiple free-after-free in slic_entry_remove

This patch fixes two free-after-free bugs in slic_entry_remove.
Specifically, slic_unmap_mmio_space() iounmaps adapter->slic_regs,
which is the same region of memory as dev->base_addr (iounmap-ed
a few lines later).

Next, both release_mem_region() and pci_release_regions() are called
on the same pci_dev struct.
