new helper: iov_iter_get_pages()

iov_iter_get_pages(iter, pages, maxsize, &start) grabs references pinning
the pages of up to maxsize of (contiguous) data from iter.  Returns the
amount of memory grabbed or -error.  In case of success, the requested
area begins at offset start in pages[0] and runs through pages[1], etc.
Less than requested amount might be returned - either because the contiguous
area in the beginning of iterator is smaller than requested, or because
the kernel failed to pin that many pages.

direct-io.c switched to using iov_iter_get_pages()
