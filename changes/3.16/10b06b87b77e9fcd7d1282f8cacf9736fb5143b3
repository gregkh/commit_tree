drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1343.c: fix potential race condition

Avoid the potential race condition by avoiding bailing out of driver in
probe after registering with rtc subsystem

Also the set_alarm , read_alarm and alarm_irq_enable returns error if irq
registration fails in probe.

Also the sysfs will not create entry for alarm if irq registration fails
in probe.
