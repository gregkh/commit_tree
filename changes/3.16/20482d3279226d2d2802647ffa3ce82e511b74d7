pinctrl: baytrail: Add back Baytrail-T ACPI ID

Now that the x86 dynamic IRQ allocation problem has been resolved with
commmit 62a08ae2a576 (genirq: x86: Ensure that dynamic irq allocation does
not conflict), we can add back Baytrail-T ACPI ID to the pinctrl driver.

This makes the driver to work on Asus T100 where it is needed for several
things like ACPI GPIO events and SD card detection.
