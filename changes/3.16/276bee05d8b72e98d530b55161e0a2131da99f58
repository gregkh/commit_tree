clocksource: sh_mtu2: Use request_irq() instead of setup_irq()

The driver claims it needs to register an interrupt handler too early
for request_irq(). This might have been true in the past, but the only
meaningful difference between request_irq() and setup_irq() today is an
additional kzalloc() call in request_irq(). As the driver calls
kmalloc() itself we know that the slab allocator is available, we can
thus switch to request_irq().
