tracing: Add funcgraph_tail option to print function name after closing braces

In the function-graph tracer, add a funcgraph_tail option
to print the function name on all } lines, not just
functions whose first line is no longer in the trace
buffer.

If a function calls other traced functions, its total
time appears on its } line.  This change allows grep
to be used to determine the function for which the
line corresponds.

Update Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt to describe
this new option.
