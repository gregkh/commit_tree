drm/i915: tell the user if both KMS and UMS are disabled

If both KMS is disabled (by i915.modeset=0 or nomodeset parameters) and
UMS is disabled (by CONFIG_DRM_I915_UMS=n, the default), the user might
not be aware his setup is not supported. Inform the users (and, by
extension, the poor i915 developers having to read their dmesgs in bug
reports) why their graphics experience might be lacking.

A similar message was added on the UMS path in
commit e147accbd19f55489dabdcc4dc3551cc3e3f2553
