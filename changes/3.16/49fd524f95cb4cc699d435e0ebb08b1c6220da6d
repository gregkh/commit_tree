bsg: update check for rq based driver for blk-mq

bsg currently checks ->request_fn to check whether a queue can
handle struct request. But with blk-mq, we don't have a request_fn
yet are request based. Add a queue_is_rq_based() helper and use
that in bsg, I'm guessing this is not the last place we need to
update for this. Besides, it better explains what is being
checked.
