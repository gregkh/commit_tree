s390/pci: improve state check when processing hotplug events

Processing pci hotplug events can fail when a pci function is in an
unexpected state. This can happen when we already processed the
change associated with the hotplug event (especially when receiving
hotplug events during early boot).
Just ignore the event in this case.
