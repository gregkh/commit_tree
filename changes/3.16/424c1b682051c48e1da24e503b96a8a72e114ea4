rcutorture: Add missing destroy_timer_on_stack()

The rcu_torture_reader() function uses an on-stack timer_list structure
which it initializes with setup_timer_on_stack().  However, it fails to
use destroy_timer_on_stack() before exiting, which results in leaking a
tracking object if DEBUG_OBJECTS is enabled.  This commit therefore
invokes destroy_timer_on_stack() to avoid this leakage.
