drm/i915: Use the coarse ping-pong mechanism based on drm fd to dispatch the BSD command on BDW GT3

The BDW GT3 has two independent BSD rings, which can be used to process the
video commands. To be simpler, it is transparent to user-space driver/middle.
Instead the kernel driver will decide which ring is to dispatch the BSD video
command.

As every BSD ring is powerful, it is enough to dispatch the BSD video command
based on the drm fd. In such case it can play back video stream while encoding
another video stream. The coarse ping-pong mechanism is used to determine
which BSD ring is used to dispatch the BSD video command.

V1->V2: Follow Daniel's comment and use the simple ping-pong mechanism.
This is only to add the support of dual BSD rings on BDW GT3 machine.
The further optimization will be considered in another patch set.

V2->V3: Follow Daniel's comment to use the struct_mutext instead of
atomic_t during determining which ring can be used to dispatch Video command.
