arm64: fix el2_setup check of CurrentEL

The CurrentEL system register reports the Current Exception Level
of the CPU. It doesn't say anything about the stack handling, and
yet we compare it to PSR_MODE_EL2t and PSR_MODE_EL2h.

It works by chance because PSR_MODE_EL2t happens to match the right
bits, but that's otherwise a very bad idea. Just check for the EL
value instead.
