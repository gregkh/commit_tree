f2fs: do checkpoint for the renamed inode

If an inode is renamed, it should be registered as file_lost_pino to conduct
checkpoint at f2fs_sync_file.
Otherwise, the inode cannot be recovered due to no dent_mark in the following
scenario.

Note that, this scenario is from xfstests/322.

1. create "a"
2. fsync "a"
3. rename "a" to "b"
4. fsync "b"
5. Sudden power-cut

After recovery is done, "b" should be seen.
However, the result shows "a", since the recovery procedure does not enter
recover_dentry due to no dent_mark.

The reason is like below.
- The nid of "a" is checkpointed during #2, f2fs_sync_file.
- The inode page for "b" produced by #3 is written without dent_mark by
sync_node_pages.

So, this patch fixes this bug by assinging file_lost_pino to the "a"'s inode.
If the pino is lost, f2fs_sync_file conducts checkpoint, and then recovers
the latest pino and its dentry information for further recovery.
