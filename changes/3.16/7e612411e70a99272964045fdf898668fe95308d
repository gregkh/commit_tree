i40e: relax the firmware API version check

As long as the Firmware isn't reporting a higher API major version number
than what the driver knows about, the driver does not need to worry as
much about greater minor numbers.  The API changes minor numbers when
things get added to the API, but no existing structs or calls are changed.
The driver has the option of warning that the minor numbers don't match.

This will allow a little more flexibility in handling newer NICs and NVMs
in the field.
