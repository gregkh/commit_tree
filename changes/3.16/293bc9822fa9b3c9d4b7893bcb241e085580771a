new methods: ->read_iter() and ->write_iter()

Beginning to introduce those.  Just the callers for now, and it's
clumsier than it'll eventually become; once we finish converting
aio_read and aio_write instances, the things will get nicer.

For now, these guys are in parallel to ->aio_read() and ->aio_write();
they take iocb and iov_iter, with everything in iov_iter already
validated.  File offset is passed in iocb->ki_pos, iov/nr_segs -
in iov_iter.

Main concerns in that series are stack footprint and ability to
split the damn thing cleanly.
