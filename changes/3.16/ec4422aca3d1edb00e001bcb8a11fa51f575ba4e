mmc: dove: fix missing MACH_DOVE dependency

DT-enabled Dove moved over from ARCH_DOVE in mach-dove to MACH_DOVE in
mach-mvebu. As non-DT ARCH_DOVE will stay to rot for a while, add a new
DT-only MACH_DOVE Kconfig. This slipped through the cracks and now is
a fix to allow to build Dove's SDHCI driver for mach-mvebu on v3.15-rc.
