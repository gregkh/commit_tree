PM / sleep: trace events for device PM callbacks

Adds two trace events which supply the same info that initcall_debug
provides, but via ftrace instead of dmesg. The existing initcall_debug
calls require the pm_print_times_enabled var to be set (either via
sysfs or via the kernel cmd line). The new trace events provide all the
same info as the initcall_debug prints but with less overhead, and also
with coverage of device prepare and complete device callbacks.

These events replace the device_pm_report_time event (which has been
removed). device_pm_callback_start is called first and provides the device
and callback info. device_pm_callback_end is called after with the
device name and error info. The time and pid are gathered from the trace
data headers.
