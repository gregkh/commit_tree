ath10k: update regulatory domain settings for 10.x firmware

Regulatory domain settings for firmware 10.x has more options
than main firmware, so handle regulatory domain setup separately
for both supported firmwares. Fill in additional dfs domain
parameter according to current regulatory.
This patch does not solve any known bug. Not handled parameter
for firmware 10.x was found during code review.
