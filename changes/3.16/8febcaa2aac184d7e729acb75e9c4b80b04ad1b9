device: introduce per device dma_pfn_offset

On few architectures, there are few restrictions on DMAble area of system
RAM. That also means that devices needs to know about this restrictions so
that the dma_masks can be updated accordingly and dma address translation
helpers can add/subtract the dma offset.

In most of cases DMA addresses can be performed using offset value of
Bus address space relatively to physical address space as following:

PFN->DMA:  __pfn_to_phys(pfn + [-]dma_pfn_offset)
DMA->PFN:  __phys_to_pfn(dma_addr) + [-]dma_pfn_offset

So we introduce per device dma_pfn_offset which can be popullated
by architecture init code while creating the devices.
