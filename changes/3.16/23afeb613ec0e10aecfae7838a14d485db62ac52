watchdog: ath79_wdt: avoid spurious restarts on AR934x

On some AR934x based systems, where the frequency of
the AHB bus is relatively high, the built-in watchdog
causes a spurious restart when it gets enabled.

The possible cause of these restarts is that the timeout
value written into the TIMER register does not reaches
the hardware in time.

Add an explicit delay into the ath79_wdt_enable function
to avoid the spurious restarts.
