ipc/sem.c: bugfix for semctl(,,GETZCNT)

GETZCNT is supposed to return the number of threads that wait until a
semaphore value becomes 0.

The current implementation overlooks complex operations that contain
both wait-for-zero operation and operations that alter at least one
semaphore.

The patch fixes that.  It's intentionally copy&paste, this will be
cleaned up in the next patch.
