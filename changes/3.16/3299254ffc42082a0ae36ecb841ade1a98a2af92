drm/i915: Flip the sense of AGPBUSY_DIS bit

My Gen3 Bspec lists the AGPBUSY# bit in INSTPM as an enable bit rather
than a disable bit. Our code has the opposite idea. Make the code match
the spec.

Might fix some gen3 C3 related interrupt delivery problems. Untested
due to lack of hardware.

v2: call it AGPBUSY_INT_EN to make it clearer it has to do with interrupts
