openvswitch: Compact sw_flow_key.

Minimize padding in sw_flow_key and move 'tp' top the main struct.
These changes simplify code when accessing the transport port numbers
and the tcp flags, and makes the sw_flow_key 8 bytes smaller on 64-bit
systems (128->120 bytes).  These changes also make the keys for IPv4
packets to fit in one cache line.

There is a valid concern for safety of packing the struct
ovs_key_ipv4_tunnel, as it would be possible to take the address of
the tun_id member as a __be64 * which could result in unaligned access
in some systems. However:

- sw_flow_key itself is 64-bit aligned, so the tun_id within is
  always
  64-bit aligned.
- We never make arrays of ovs_key_ipv4_tunnel (which would force
  every
  second tun_key to be misaligned).
- We never take the address of the tun_id in to a __be64 *.
- Whereever we use struct ovs_key_ipv4_tunnel outside the
  sw_flow_key,
  it is in stack (on tunnel input functions), where compiler has full
  control of the alignment.
