KVM: s390: deliver program irq parameters and use correct ilc

When a program interrupt was to be delivered until now, no program interrupt
parameters were stored in the low-core of the target vcpu.

This patch enables the delivery of those program interrupt parameters, takes
care of concurrent PER events which can be injected in addition to any program
interrupt and uses the correct instruction length code (depending on the
interception code) for the injection of program interrupts.
