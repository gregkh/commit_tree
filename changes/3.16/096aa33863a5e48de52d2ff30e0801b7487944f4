sched/numa: Decay ->wakee_flips instead of zeroing

Affine wakeups have the potential to interfere with NUMA placement.
If a task wakes up too many other tasks, affine wakeups will get
disabled.

However, regardless of how many other tasks it wakes up, it gets
re-enabled once a second, potentially interfering with NUMA
placement of other tasks.

By decaying wakee_wakes in half instead of zeroing it, we can avoid
that problem for some workloads.
