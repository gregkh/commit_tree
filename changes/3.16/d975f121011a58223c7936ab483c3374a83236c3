mmc: sdhci: cache timing information locally

Rather than reading back the timing information from the registers,
cache it locally.  This allows implementations to translate the UHS
timing by overriding the set_uhs_signaling() method as required
without also having to emulate the SDHCI_HOST_CONTROL2 register.
