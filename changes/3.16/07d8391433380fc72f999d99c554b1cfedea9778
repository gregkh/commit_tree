ACPICA: Linux headers: Add <asm/acenv.h> to remove mis-ordered inclusion of <asm/acpi.h>

There is a mis-order inclusion for <asm/acpi.h>.

As we will enforce including <linux/acpi.h> for all Linux ACPI users, we
can find the inclusion order is as follows:

<linux/acpi.h>
  <acpi/acpi.h>
   <acpi/platform/acenv.h>
    (acenv.h before including aclinux.h)
    <acpi/platform/aclinux.h>
...........................................................................
     (aclinux.h before including asm/acpi.h)
     <asm/acpi.h>                             @Redundant@
      (ACPICA specific stuff)
...........................................................................
...........................................................................
      (Linux ACPI specific stuff) ? - - - - - - - - - - - - +
     (aclinux.h after including asm/acpi.h)   @Invisible@   |
    (acenv.h after including aclinux.h)       @Invisible@   |
   other ACPICA headers                       @Invisible@   |
............................................................|..............
  <acpi/acpi_bus.h>                                         |
  <acpi/acpi_drivers.h>                                     |
  <asm/acpi.h> (Excluded)                                   |
   (Linux ACPI specific stuff) ! <- - - - - - - - - - - - - +

NOTE that, in ACPICA, <acpi/platform/acenv.h> is more like Kconfig
generated <generated/autoconf.h> for Linux, it is meant to be included
before including any ACPICA code.

In the above figure, there is a question mark for "Linux ACPI specific
stuff" in <asm/acpi.h> which should be included after including all other
ACPICA header files.  Thus they really need to be moved to the position
marked with exclaimation mark or the definitions in the blocks marked with
"@Invisible@" will be invisible to such architecture specific "Linux ACPI
specific stuff" header blocks.  This leaves 2 issues:
1. All environmental definitions in these blocks should have a copy in the
   area marked with "@Redundant@" if they are required by the "Linux ACPI
   specific stuff".
2. We cannot use any ACPICA defined types in <asm/acpi.h>.

This patch splits architecture specific ACPICA stuff from <asm/acpi.h> to
fix this issue.
