xen-netfront: Factor queue-specific data into queue struct.

In preparation for multi-queue support in xen-netfront, move the
queue-specific data from struct netfront_info to struct netfront_queue,
and update the rest of the code to use this.

Also adds loops over queues where appropriate, even though only one is
configured at this point, and uses alloc_etherdev_mq() and the
corresponding multi-queue netif wake/start/stop functions in preparation
for multiple active queues.

Finally, implements a trivial queue selection function suitable for
ndo_select_queue, which simply returns 0, selecting the first (and
only) queue.
