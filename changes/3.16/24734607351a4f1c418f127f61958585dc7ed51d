NFC: digital: Add support for ISO/IEC 14443-B Protocol

Add support for the ISO/IEC 14443-B protocol and Type 4B tags.
It is expected that there will be only one tag within range so the full
anticollision scheme is not implemented. Only the SENSB_REQ/SENSB_RES
and ATTRIB_REQ/ATTRIB_RES are implemented.
