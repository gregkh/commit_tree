ASoC: jack: Basic GPIO descriptor conversion

This patch does basic GPIO descriptor conversion to soc-jack. Even the GPIOs
are still passed and requested using legacy GPIO numbers the driver
internals are converted to use GPIO descriptor API.

Motivation for this is to prepare soc-jack so that it will allow registering
jack GPIO pins using both GPIO descriptors and legacy GPIO numbers.
