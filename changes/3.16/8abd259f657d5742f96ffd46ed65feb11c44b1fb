ARM: l2c: provide generic hook to intercept writes to secure registers

When Linux is running in the non-secure world, any write to a secure
L2C register will generate an abort.  Platforms normally have to call
firmware to work around this.  Provide a hook for them to intercept
any L2C secure register write.

l2c_write_sec() avoids writes to secure registers which are already set
to the appropriate value, thus avoiding the overhead of needlessly
calling into the secure monitor.
