xfs: Fix rounding in xfs_alloc_fix_len()

Rounding in xfs_alloc_fix_len() is wrong. As the comment states, the
result should be a number of a form (k*prod+mod) however due to sign
mistake the result is different. As a result allocations on raid arrays
could be misaligned in some cases.

This also seems to fix occasional assertion failure:
	XFS_WANT_CORRUPTED_GOTO(rlen <= flen, error0)
in xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_size().

Also add an assertion that the result of xfs_alloc_fix_len() is of
expected form.
