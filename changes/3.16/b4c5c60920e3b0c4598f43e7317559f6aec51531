zram: avoid lockdep splat by revalidate_disk

Sasha reported lockdep warning [1] introduced by [2].

It could be fixed by doing disk revalidation out of the init_lock.  It's
okay because disk capacity change is protected by init_lock so that
revalidate_disk always sees up-to-date value so there is no race.
