torture: Dump ftrace buffer when the RCU grace period stalls

This commit adds a call to rcutorture_trace_dump() to dump the ftrace
buffer when the RCU grace period stalls in order to help debug the
stall.  Note that this is different than the RCU CPU stall warning,
as it is rcutorture detecting the stall rather than the underlying RCU
implementation.
