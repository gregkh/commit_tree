Revert "offb: Add palette hack for little endian"

This reverts commit e1edf18b20076da83dd231dbd2146cbbc31c0b14.

This patch was a misguided attempt at fixing offb for LE ppc64
kernels on BE qemu but is just wrong ... it breaks real LE/LE
setups, LE with real HW, and existing mixed endian systems
that did the fight thing with the appropriate device-tree
property. Bad reviewing on my part, sorry.

The right fix is to either make qemu change its endian when
the guest changes endian (working on that) or to use the
existing foreign endian support.
