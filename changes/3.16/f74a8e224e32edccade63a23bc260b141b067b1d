MIPS: KVM: Add count frequency KVM register

Expose the KVM guest CP0_Count frequency to userland via a new
KVM_REG_MIPS_COUNT_HZ register accessible with the KVM_{GET,SET}_ONE_REG
ioctls.

When the frequency is altered the bias is adjusted such that the guest
CP0_Count doesn't jump discontinuously or lose any timer interrupts.
