USB: cdc-acm: minimise no-suspend window during shutdown

Now that acm_set_control() handles runtime PM properly, the only
remaining reason for the PM operations in shutdown is to clear the
needs_remote_wakeup flag before the final put.

Note that this also means that we now need to grab the write_lock to
prevent racing with resume.
