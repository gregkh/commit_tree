GFS2: Allow flocks to use normal glock dq rather than dq_wait

This patch allows flock glocks to use a non-blocking dequeue rather
than dq_wait. It also reverts the previous patch I had posted regarding
dq_wait. The reverted patch isn't necessarily a bad idea, but I decided
this might avoid unforeseen side effects, and was therefore safer.
