module: set nx before marking module MODULE_STATE_COMING.

We currently set RO & NX on modules very late: after we move them from
MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED to MODULE_STATE_COMING, and after we call
parse_args() (which can exec code in the module).

Much better is to do it in complete_formation() and then call
the notifier.

This means that the notifiers will be called on a module which
is already RO & NX, so that may cause problems (ftrace already
changed so they're unaffected).
