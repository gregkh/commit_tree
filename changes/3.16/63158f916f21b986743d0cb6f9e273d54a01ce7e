i40e/i40evf: remove chatty reset messages

Both the PF side and the VF side of the VF reset process are too noisy.
We already warn the user that a reset is happening, and that is
sufficient.

Because some of these message are inside if statements, we have to
rejigger the brackets at the same time to keep our coding style
consistent.
