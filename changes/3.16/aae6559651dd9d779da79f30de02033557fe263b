KVM: PPC: MPIC: Reset IRQ source private members

When we reset the in-kernel MPIC controller, we forget to reset some hidden
state such as destmask and output. This state is usually set when the guest
writes to the IDR register for a specific IRQ line.

To make sure we stay in sync and don't forget hidden state, treat reset of
the IDR register as a simple write of the IDR register. That automatically
updates all the hidden state as well.
