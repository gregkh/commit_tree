powerpc: Check cpu_thread_in_subcore() in __cpu_up()

To support split core we need to change the check in __cpu_up() that
determines if a cpu is allowed to come online.

Currently we refuse to online cpus which are not the primary thread
within their core.

On POWER8 with split core support this check needs to instead refuse to
online cpus which are not the primary thread within their *sub* core.

On POWER7 and other systems that do not support split core,
threads_per_subcore == threads_per_core and so the check is equivalent.
