drm/i915/bdw: Add WT caching ability

I don't have any insight on what parts can do what. The docs do seem to
suggest WT caching works in at least the same manner as it does on
Haswell.

The addr = 0  is to shut up GCC:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_gtt.c:80:7: warning: 'addr' may be used
uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
