ACPI / platform / LPSS: Enable async suspend/resume of LPSS devices

To seed up suspend and resume of devices included into Intel SoCs
handled by the ACPI LPSS driver during system suspend, make
acpi_lpss_create_device() call device_enable_async_suspend() for
every device created by it.

This requires acpi_create_platform_device() to be modified to return
a pointer to struct platform_device instead of an int.  As a result,
acpi_create_platform_device() cannot be pointed to by the .attach
pointer in platform_handler directly any more, so a simple wrapper
around it is necessary for this purpose.  That, in turn, allows the
second unused argument of acpi_create_platform_device() to be
dropped, which is an improvement.
