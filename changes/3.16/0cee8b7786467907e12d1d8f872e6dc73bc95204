cgroup: fix offlining child waiting in cgroup_subtree_control_write()

cgroup_subtree_control_write() waits for offline to complete
child-by-child before enabling a controller; however, it has a couple
bugs.

* It doesn't initialize the wait_queue_t.  This can lead to infinite
  hang on the following schedule() among other things.

* It forgets to pin the child before releasing cgroup_tree_mutex and
  performing schedule().  The child may already be gone by the time it
  wakes up and invokes finish_wait().  Pin the child being waited on.
