MIPS: MSP71xx: Remove checks for two macros

Since v2.6.39 there are checks for CONFIG_MSP_HAS_DUAL_USB and checks
for CONFIG_MSP_HAS_TSMAC in the code. The related Kconfig symbols have
never been added. These checks have evaluated to false for three years
now. Remove them and the code they have been hiding.
