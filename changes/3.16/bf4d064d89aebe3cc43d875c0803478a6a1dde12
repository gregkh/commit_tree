lib/xz: enable all filters by default in Kconfig

This restores the old behavior that existed before 2013-02-22, when
changes were made by 64dbfb444c150 ("decompressors: drop dependency on
CONFIG_EXPERT") and 5dc49c75a2 ("decompressors: make the default
XZ_DEC_* config match the selected architecture").

Disabling the filters only makes sense on embedded systems.
