s390/airq: silence lockdep warning

airq_iv_(alloc|free) is called by some users with interrupts enabled
and by some with interrupts disabled which leads to the following
lockdep warning:

[ INFO: possible irq lock inversion dependency detected ]
3.14.0-15249-gbf29b7b-dirty #25 Not tainted
---------------------------------------------------------
insmod/2108 just changed the state of lock:
 (&(&iv->lock)->rlock){+.....}, at: [<000000000046ee3e>] airq_iv_alloc+0x62/0x228
but this lock was taken by another, HARDIRQ-READ-safe lock in the past:
 (&info->lock){.-.-..}

and interrupts could create inverse lock ordering between them.

other info that might help us debug this:
 Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(&(&iv->lock)->rlock);
                               local_irq_disable();
                               lock(&info->lock);
                               lock(&(&iv->lock)->rlock);
  <Interrupt>
    lock(&info->lock);

 *** DEADLOCK ***

Although this is a false alarm (since each airq user consistently
calls these functions from the same context) fix this by ensuring
that interrupts are disabled when the airq lock is held.
