blk-mq: fix waiting for reserved tags

blk_mq_wait_for_tags() is only able to wait for "normal" tags,
not reserved tags. Pass in which one we should attempt to get
a tag for, so that waiting for reserved tags will work.

Reserved tags are used for internal commands, which are usually
serialized. Hence no waiting generally takes place, but we should
ensure that it actually works if users need that functionality.
