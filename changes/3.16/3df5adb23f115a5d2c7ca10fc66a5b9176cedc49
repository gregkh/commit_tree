serial: sc16is7xx: compile I2C when REGMAP_I2C is module

Fixed these warnings by removing the `#ifdef CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C' around their
calls as this driver selects REGMAP_I2C in Kconfig. This part of driver just
didn't compile at all when REGMAP_I2C configured as module (CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C
is not defined, just CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C_MODULE).
