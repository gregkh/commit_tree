i2c: mux: pca954x: Use the descriptor-based GPIO API

The ID-based GPIO API pushes handling of GPIO polarity to drivers.
Simplify the driver by switching to the descriptor-based GPIO API.

This also fixes a mismatch between the pca954x DT bindings that document
a "reset-gpios" property and the driver that requests a "reset-gpio"
property.
