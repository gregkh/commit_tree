sparc32: fix sparse warnings in tadpole.c

Fix following warnings:
tadpole.c:21:6: warning: symbol 'cpu_pwr_save' was not declared. Should it be static?
tadpole.c:101:13: warning: symbol 'clock_stop_probe' was not declared. Should it be static?

This actually revealed that cpu_pwr_save is only assigned.
It was left static with a TODO comment for now - this should be cleaned up later.
