usb: chipidea: add proper delay for waiting correct PHY status

After the PHY has powered and initialized, it needs some delay
for controller to reflect PHY's status. Some status and values
for id, vbus, dp/dm are only stable after this delay. The current
code tries to clear id/vbus status without enough delay, it
causes the status are not cleared properly.

This patch add 2ms delay after phy has initialized, and clear the
unexpected status after that.
