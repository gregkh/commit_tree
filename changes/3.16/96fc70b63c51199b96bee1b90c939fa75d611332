crypto: s5p-sss - Use platform_get_irq() instead of _byname()

This patch uses the platform_get_irq() instead of the
platform_get_irq_byname(). Making feeder control interrupt
as resource "0" and hash interrupt as "1".

reasons for this change.
1. Cannot find any Arch which is currently using this driver
2. Samsung Exynos4 and 5 SoCs only use the feeder control interrupt
3. Patches adding support for DT and H/W version are in pipeline
