ASoC: dapm: Make sure to always update the DAPM graph in _put_volsw()

When using auto-muted controls it may happen that the register value will not
change when changing a control from enabled to disabled (since the control might
be physically disabled due to the auto-muting). We have to make sure to still
update the DAPM graph and disconnect the mixer input.

Fixes: commit 5729507 ("ASoC: dapm: Implement mixer input auto-disable")
