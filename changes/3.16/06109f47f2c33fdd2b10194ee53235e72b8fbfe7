ASoC: wm8804: Allow control of master clock divider in PLL generation

WM8804 can run with PLL frequencies of 256xfs and 128xfs for
most sample rates. At 192kHz only 128xfs is supported. The
existing driver selects 128xfs automatically for some lower
samples rates. By using an additional mclk_div divider, it
is now possible to control the behaviour. This allows using
256xfs PLL frequency on all sample rates up to 96kHz. It
should allow lower jitter and better signal quality. The
behavior has to be controlled by the sound card driver,
because some sample frequency share the same setting. e.g.
192kHz and 96kHz use 24.576MHz master clock. The only
difference is the MCLK divider.
