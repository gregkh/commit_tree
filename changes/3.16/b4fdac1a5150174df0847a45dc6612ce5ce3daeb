nfs: modify pg_test interface to return size_t

This is a step toward allowing pg_test to inform the the
coalescing code to reduce the size of requests so they may fit in
whatever scheme the pg_test callback wants to define.

For now, just return the size of the request if there is space, or 0
if there is not.  This shouldn't change any behavior as it acts
the same as when the pg_test functions returned bool.
