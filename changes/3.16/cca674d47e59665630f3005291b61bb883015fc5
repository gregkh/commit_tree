mac80211: export the expected throughput

Add get_expected_throughput() API to mac80211 so that each
driver can implement its own version based on the RC
algorithm they are using (might be using an HW RC algo).
The API returns a value expressed in Kbps.

Also, add the new get_expected_throughput() member
to the rate_control_ops structure in order to be
able to query the RC algorithm (this patch provides an
implementation of this API for both minstrel and
minstrel_ht).

The related member in the station_info object is now
filled accordingly when dumping a station.
