gpio: of: Fix handling for deferred probe for -gpio suffix

Commit dd34c37aa3e (gpio: of: Allow -gpio suffix for property names)
added parsing for both -gpio and -gpios suffix but also changed
the handling for deferred probe unintentionally. Because of the
looping the second name will now return -ENOENT instead of
-EPROBE_DEFER. Fix the issue by breaking out of the loop if
-EPROBE_DEFER is encountered.
