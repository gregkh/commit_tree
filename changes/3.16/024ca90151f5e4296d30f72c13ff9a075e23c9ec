IB/srp: Fix a sporadic crash triggered by cable pulling

Avoid that the loops that iterate over the request ring can encounter
a pointer to a SCSI command in req->scmnd that is no longer associated
with that request. If the function srp_unmap_data() is invoked twice
for a SCSI command that is not in flight then that would cause
ib_fmr_pool_unmap() to be invoked with an invalid pointer as argument,
resulting in a kernel oops.
