powerpc/powernv: Fundamental reset on PLX ports

The patch intends to support fundamental reset on PLX downstream
ports. If the PCI device matches any one of the internal table,
which includes PLX vendor ID, bridge device ID, register offset
for fundamental reset and bit, fundamental reset will be done
accordingly. Otherwise, it will fail back to hot reset.

Additional flag (EEH_DEV_FRESET) is introduced to record the last
reset type on the PCI bridge.
