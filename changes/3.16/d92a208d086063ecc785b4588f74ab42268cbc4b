powerpc/pci: Mask linkDown on resetting PCI bus

The problem was initially reported by Wendy who tried pass through
IPR adapter, which was connected to PHB root port directly, to KVM
based guest. When doing that, pci_reset_bridge_secondary_bus() was
called by VFIO driver and linkDown was detected by the root port.
That caused all PEs to be frozen.

The patch fixes the issue by routing the reset for the secondary bus
of root port to underly firmware. For that, one more weak function
pci_reset_secondary_bus() is introduced so that the individual platforms
can override that and do specific reset for bridge's secondary bus.
