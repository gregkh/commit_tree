ARM: l2c: add automatic enable of early BRESP

The AXI bus protocol requires that a write response should only be
sent back to the master when the last write has been accepted.  Early
BRESP allows the L2C-310 to send the write response as soon as the
store buffer accepts the write address.

Cortex-A9 processors can signal to the L2C-310 that they wish to be
notified early, and if this optimisation is enabled, the L2C-310 can
signal an early write response.
