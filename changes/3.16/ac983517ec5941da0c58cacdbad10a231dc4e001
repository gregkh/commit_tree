xfs: don't sleep in xlog_cil_force_lsn on shutdown

Reports of a shutdown hang when fsyncing a directory have surfaced,
such as this:

[ 3663.394472] Call Trace:

If we trigger a shutdown in xlog_cil_push() from xlog_write(), we
will never wake waiters on the current push sequence number, so
anything waiting in xlog_cil_force_lsn() for that push sequence
number to come up will not get woken and hence stall the shutdown.

Fix this by ensuring we call wake_up_all(&cil->xc_commit_wait) in
the push abort handling, in the log shutdown code when waking all
waiters, and adding a shutdown check in the sequence completion wait
loops to ensure they abort when a wakeup due to a shutdown occurs.
