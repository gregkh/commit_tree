tipc: use bc_lock to protect node map in bearer structure

The node map variable - 'nodes' in bearer structure is only used by
bclink. When bclink accesses it, bc_lock is held. But when change it,
for instance, in tipc_bearer_add_dest() or tipc_bearer_remove_dest()
the bc_lock is not taken at all. To avoid any inconsistent data, we
should always grab bc_lock while accessing node map variable.
