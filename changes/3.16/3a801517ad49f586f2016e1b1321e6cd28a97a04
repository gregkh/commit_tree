KVM: s390: correct locking for s390_enable_skey

Use the mm semaphore to serialize multiple invocations of s390_enable_skey.
The second CPU faulting on a storage key operation needs to wait for the
completion of the page table update. Taking the mm semaphore writable
has the positive side-effect that it prevents any host faults from
taking place which does have implications on keys vs PGSTE.
