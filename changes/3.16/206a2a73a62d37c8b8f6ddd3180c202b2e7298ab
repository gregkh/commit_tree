arm64: mm: Create gigabyte kernel logical mappings where possible

We have the capability to map 1GB level 1 blocks when using a 4K
granule.

This patch adjusts the create_mapping logic s.t. when mapping physical
memory on boot, we attempt to use a 1GB block if both the VA and PA
start and end are 1GB aligned. This both reduces the levels of lookup
required to resolve a kernel logical address, as well as reduces TLB
pressure on cores that support 1GB TLB entries.
