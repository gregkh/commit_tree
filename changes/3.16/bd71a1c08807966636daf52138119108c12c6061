serial: kgdb_nmi: Improve console integration with KDB I/O

kgdb_nmi_tty_enabled is used for two unrelated purposes, namely to
suppress normal TTY input handling and to suppress console output
(although it has no effect at all on TTY output). A much better way to
handle muting the console is to not have to mute it in the first place!
That's what this patch does.
