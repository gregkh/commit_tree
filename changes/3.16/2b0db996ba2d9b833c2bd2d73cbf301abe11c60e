ASoC: fsl-ssi: Remove fsl_ssi_setup

fsl_ssi_set_dai_fmt() manages most of the register setup routines now.
fsl_ssi_setup() makes the same as fsl_ssi_set_dai_fmt() but it relies on
DT properties.

In most cases the settings of fsl_ssi_setup() are already overwritten by
fsl_ssi_set_dai_fmt() when it is called by the soc-core when a sound
card is added. As these settings depend on the combination of codec and
cpu DAI, this should really be done by sound cards.

This patch removes fsl_ssi_setup() and adds the missing register setups
to fsl_ssi_set_dai_fmt(). It also removes all calls to fsl_ssi_setup().
