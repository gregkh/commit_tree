ALSA: hda - Adjust speaker HPF and add LED support for HP Spectre 13

HP Spectre 13 has the IDT 92HD95 codec, and BIOS seems to set the
default high-pass filter in some "safer" range, which results in the
very soft tone from the built-in speakers in contrast to Windows.
Also, the mute LED control is missing, since 92HD95 codec still has no
HP-specific fixups for GPIO setups.

This patch adds these missing features: the HPF is adjusted by the
vendor-specific verb, and the LED is set up from a DMI string (but
with the default polarity = 0 assumption due to the incomplete BIOS on
the given machine).
