ASoC: simple-card: Move dai-link level properties away from dai subnodes

The properties like format, bitclock-master, frame-master,
bitclock-inversion, and frame-inversion should be common to the dais
connected with a dai-link. For bitclock-master and frame-master
properties to be unambiguous they need to indicate the mastering dai
node with a phandle.
