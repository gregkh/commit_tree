ARM: EXYNOS: Fix kernel panic when unplugging CPU1 on exynos

A look at the code reveals use of S5P_VA_SYSRAM macro, in case of certain SoC
revisions, which is not valid any longer, after SYSRAM started to be mapped
dynamically. The new dynamic mapping is stored in sysram_base_addr variable,
which is declared static in platsmp.c

This fix makes sysram_base_addr non-static, declared it in common.h and used
in pm.c instead of S5P_VA_SYSRAM.
