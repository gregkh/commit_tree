PM / sleep: unregister wakeup source when disabling device wakeup

When enabling a device' wakeup capability, a wakeup source
is created for the device automatically. But the wakeup source
is not unregistered when disabling the device' wakeup capability.

This results in zombie wakeup sources, after devices/drivers are unregistered.
