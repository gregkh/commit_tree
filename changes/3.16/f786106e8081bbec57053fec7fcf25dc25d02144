tracing/uprobes: Kill the bogus UPROBE_HANDLER_REMOVE code in uprobe_dispatcher()

I do not know why dd9fa555d7bb "tracing/uprobes: Move argument fetching
to uprobe_dispatcher()" added the UPROBE_HANDLER_REMOVE, but it looks
wrong.

OK, perhaps it makes sense to avoid store_trace_args() if the tracee is
nacked by uprobe_perf_filter(). But then we should kill the same code
in uprobe_perf_func() and unify the TRACE/PROFILE filtering (we need to
do this anyway to mix perf/ftrace). Until then this code actually adds
the pessimization because uprobe_perf_filter() will be called twice and
return T in likely case.
