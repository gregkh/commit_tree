HID: rmi: introduce RMI driver for Synaptics touchpads

This driver add support for RMI4 over USB or I2C.
The current state is that it uses its own RMI4 implementation, but once
RMI4 is merged upstream, the driver will be a transport driver for the
RMI4 library.

Part of this driver should be considered as temporary. Most of the RMI4
processing and input handling will be deleted at some point.

I based my work on Andrew's regarding its port of RMI4 over HID (see
https://github.com/mightybigcar/synaptics-rmi4/tree/rmihid )
This repo presents how the driver may looks like at the end:
https://github.com/mightybigcar/synaptics-rmi4/blob/rmihid/drivers/input/rmi4/rmi_hid.c

Without this temporary solution, the workaround we gave to users
is to disable i2c-hid, which leads to disabling the touchscreen on the
XPS 11 and 12 (Haswell generation).
