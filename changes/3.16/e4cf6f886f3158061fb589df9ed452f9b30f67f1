perf ui/gtk: Fix callchain display

With current output field change, GTK browser cannot display callchain
information correctly since it couldn't determine where the symbol
column is.  This is a problem - just for now I changed to use the last
column since it'll work for most cases.

Also it has a same problem of the percentage as stdio code.
