x86/kprobes: Fix build errors and blacklist context_track_user

This essentially reverts commit:

  ecd50f714c42 ("kprobes, x86: Call exception_enter after kprobes handled")

since it causes build errors with CONFIG_CONTEXT_TRACKING and
that has been made from misunderstandings;
context_track_user_*() don't involve much in interrupt context,
it just returns if in_interrupt() is true.

Instead of changing the do_debug/int3(), this just adds
context_track_user_*() to kprobes blacklist, since those are
still can be called right before kprobes handles int3 and debug
exceptions, and probing those will cause an infinite loop.
