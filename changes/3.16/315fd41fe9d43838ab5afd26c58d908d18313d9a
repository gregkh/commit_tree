ALSA: fireworks: Add connection and stream management

Fireworks manages connections by CMP and can transmit/receive AMDTP streams
with a few quirks. This commit adds functionality to start/stop the streams.

Major Fireworks products don't support 'SYT-Match' clock source mode, except
for AudioFire12/8(till 2009 July) with firmware version 1.0. Already in
previous commit, this driver don't support such old firmwares. So this commit
adds support for non 'SYT-Match' clock source modes.

I note that this driver has a short gap for MIDI streams when starting PCM
stream. When AMDTP streams are running only for MIDI data and PCM data is
going to be joined at different sampling rate, then AMDTP streams are
stopped once and started again after changing sampling rate.

Unfortunately, Fireworks is not fully compliant to IEC 61883-1/6. Some commits
following to this commit add these quirks.
