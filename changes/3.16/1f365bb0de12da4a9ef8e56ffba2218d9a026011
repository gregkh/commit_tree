KVM: PPC: BOOK3S: HV: Add mixed page-size support for guest

On recent IBM Power CPUs, while the hashed page table is looked up using
the page size from the segmentation hardware (i.e. the SLB), it is
possible to have the HPT entry indicate a larger page size.  Thus for
example it is possible to put a 16MB page in a 64kB segment, but since
the hash lookup is done using a 64kB page size, it may be necessary to
put multiple entries in the HPT for a single 16MB page.  This
capability is called mixed page-size segment (MPSS).  With MPSS,
there are two relevant page sizes: the base page size, which is the
size used in searching the HPT, and the actual page size, which is the
size indicated in the HPT entry. [ Note that the actual page size is
always >= base page size ].

We use "ibm,segment-page-sizes" device tree node to advertise
the MPSS support to PAPR guest. The penc encoding indicates whether
we support a specific combination of base page size and actual
page size in the same segment. We also use the penc value in the
LP encoding of HPTE entry.

This patch exposes MPSS support to KVM guest by advertising the
feature via "ibm,segment-page-sizes". It also adds the necessary changes
to decode the base page size and the actual page size correctly from the
HPTE entry.
