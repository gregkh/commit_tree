ALSA: firewire-lib: Add a new function to check others' connection

Plug Control Registers have two fields related to the number of established
connections, one is 'Broadcast connection counter' and another is
'Point-to-point connection counter'. The driver can know there are established
connections or not to check these fields.

This commit is for considering about JACK/FFADO streaming. Currently, when
JACK/FFADO starts its streaming to the device, cmp_connection_establish() is
failed expectedly. This seems to be enough but there are some devices which
needs to change sampling frequency before trying to establish connections.
For such devices, this functionality is needed.
