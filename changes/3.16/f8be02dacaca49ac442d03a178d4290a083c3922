MIPS: KVM: Add CP0_Count/Compare KVM register access

Implement KVM_{GET,SET}_ONE_REG ioctl based access to the guest CP0
Count and Compare registers. These registers are special in that writing
to them has side effects (adjusting the time until the next timer
interrupt) and reading of Count depends on the time. Therefore add a
couple of callbacks so that different implementations (trap & emulate or
VZ) can implement them differently depending on what the hardware
provides.

The trap & emulate versions mostly duplicate what happens when a T&E
guest reads or writes these registers, so it inherits the same
limitations which can be fixed in later patches.
