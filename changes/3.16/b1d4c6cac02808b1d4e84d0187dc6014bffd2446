MIPS: PM: Add CPU PM callbacks for general CPU context

Add a CPU power management notifier callback for preserving general CPU
context. The CPU PM callbacks will be triggered by the powering down of
CPU cores, for example by cpuidle drivers & in the future by suspend to
RAM implementations.

The current state preserved is mostly related to the process context:
- FPU
- DSP
- ASID
- UserLocal
- Watch registers
