Btrfs: assert send doesn't attempt to start transactions

When starting a transaction just assert that current->journal_info
doesn't contain a send transaction stub, since send isn't supposed
to start transactions and when it finishes (either successfully or
not) it's supposed to set current->journal_info to NULL.

This is motivated by the change titled:
