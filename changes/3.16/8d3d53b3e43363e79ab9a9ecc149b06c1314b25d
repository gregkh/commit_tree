xen-netback: Add support for multiple queues

Builds on the refactoring of the previous patch to implement multiple
queues between xen-netfront and xen-netback.

Writes the maximum supported number of queues into XenStore, and reads
the values written by the frontend to determine how many queues to use.

Ring references and event channels are read from XenStore on a per-queue
basis and rings are connected accordingly.

Also adds code to handle the cleanup of any already initialised queues
if the initialisation of a subsequent queue fails.
