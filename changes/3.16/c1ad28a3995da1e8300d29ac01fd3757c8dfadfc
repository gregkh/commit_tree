staging: silicom/bypasslib/bp_ioctl.h: Fix erroneous global variable definitions

Originally, this header was defining two new typedefs, CMND_TYPE and
CMND_TYPE_SD, following this type of declaration:

typedef enum {
	...
} CMND_TYPE;

A previous commit (785086556a573f07747b3633732a9dbd7e45728f) tried to
fix warnings that were pointed out by checkpatch.pl, concerning not
adding new typedefs. But this commit only removed the 'typedef' keyword,
thus transforming both the typedefs into two the definition of global
variables. For example:

enum {
	...
} CMND_TYPE;

As noticed by the Sparse tool, this patch removes those erroneous global
variable definitions, and just leaves anonymous enum type definitions:

enum {
	...
};
