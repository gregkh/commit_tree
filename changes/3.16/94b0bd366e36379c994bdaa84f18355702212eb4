ARM: orion5x: convert d2net to Device Tree

This commit converts the LaCie d2 Network platform to the Device Tree.

All devices except LEDs are converted, because the LED code needs a
non-LED GPIO to be set to a given value for the LEDs to work, and this
cannot yet be easily represented in DT.

Also, references to the LaCie Big Disk Network platform are lost,
because this platform apparently has exactly the same hardware support
as the LaCie d2 Network, so their Device Tree files would be
identical.
