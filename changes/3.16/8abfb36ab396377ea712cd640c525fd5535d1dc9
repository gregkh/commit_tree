f2fs: atomically set inode->i_flags in f2fs_set_inode_flags()

Use set_mask_bits() to atomically set i_flags instead of clearing out the
S_IMMUTABLE, S_APPEND, etc. flags and then setting them from the
FS_IMMUTABLE_FL, FS_APPEND_FL, etc. flags, since this opens up a race
where an immutable file has the immutable flag cleared for a brief
window of time.
