iio: ak8975: Fix issue with the name

Fixing issue caused by clash of two patches, one adding a name with
the acpi enumeration patch.

54ab3e24 Beomho Seo          2014-04-02 @572  	indio_dev->name = id->name;
d913971e Srinivas Pandruvada 2014-03-19  574  	indio_dev->name = name;

The name added by commit 54ab3e24 is not required as this is already
added by taking care of case where id is NULL.
