USB: usb_wwan: fix potential blocked I/O after resume

Keep trying to submit urbs rather than bail out on first read-urb
submission error, which would also prevent I/O for any further ports
from being resumed.

Instead keep an error count, for all types of failed submissions, and
let USB core know that something went wrong.

Also make sure to always clear the suspended flag. Currently a failed
read-urb submission would prevent cached writes as well as any
subsequent writes from being submitted until next suspend-resume cycle,
something which may not even necessarily happen.

Note that USB core currently only logs an error if an interface resume
failed.

option driver")
