ARM: mvebu: add Armada 38x compatible string to pmsu

Since the Armada 38x PMSU registers are slightly different than the
Armada 370/XP PMSU ones, we introduce a new compatible string
"armada-380-pmsu" in the PMSU driver. These differences are not
visible for the current usage of the PMSU, but they might become
visible in the future.
