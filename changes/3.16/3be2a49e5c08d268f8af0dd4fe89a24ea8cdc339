of: provide a binding for fixed link PHYs

Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
binding allows to describe a "fixed link" using a special PHY node.

This patch adds:

 * A documentation for the fixed PHY Device Tree binding.

 * An of_phy_is_fixed_link() function that an Ethernet driver can call
   on its PHY phandle to find out whether it's a fixed link PHY or
   not. It should typically be used to know if
   of_phy_register_fixed_link() should be called.

 * An of_phy_register_fixed_link() function that instantiates the
   fixed PHY into the PHY subsystem, so that when the driver calls
   of_phy_connect(), the PHY device associated to the OF node will be
   found.

These two additional functions also support the old fixed-link Device
Tree binding used on PowerPC platforms, so that ultimately, the
network device drivers for those platforms could be converted to use
of_phy_is_fixed_link() and of_phy_register_fixed_link() instead of
of_phy_connect_fixed_link(), while keeping compatibility with their
respective Device Tree bindings.
