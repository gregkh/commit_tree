powerpc: Clear ELF personality flag if ELFv2 is not requested.

The POWER kernel uses a personality flag to determine whether it should
be setting up function descriptors or not (per the updated ABI).  This
flag wasn't being cleared on a new process but instead was being
inherited.  The visible effect was that an ELFv2 binary could not execve
to an ELFv1 binary.
