net: filter: add test for loading SKF_AD_OFF limits

This check tests that overloading BPF_LD | BPF_ABS with an
always invalid BPF extension, that is SKF_AD_MAX, fails to
make sure classic BPF behaviour is correct in filter checker.

Also, we add a test for loading at packet offset SKF_AD_OFF-1
which should pass the filter, but later on fail during runtime.
