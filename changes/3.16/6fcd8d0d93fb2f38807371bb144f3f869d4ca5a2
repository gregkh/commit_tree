IB/mlx4: Fix gfp passing in create_qp_common()

There are two kzalloc() calls which were not converted to use value of
gfp passed to create_qp_common() instead of using hardcoded GFP_KERNEL
in 40f2287bd583 ("IB/mlx4: Implement IB_QP_CREATE_USE_GFP_NOIO").  Fix
this by passing gfp value down properly.
