x86/xen: safely map and unmap grant frames when in atomic context

arch_gnttab_map_frames() and arch_gnttab_unmap_frames() are called in
atomic context but were calling alloc_vm_area() which might sleep.

Also, if a driver attempts to allocate a grant ref from an interrupt
and the table needs expanding, then the CPU may already by in lazy MMU
mode and apply_to_page_range() will BUG when it tries to re-enable
lazy MMU mode.

These two functions are only used in PV guests.

Introduce arch_gnttab_init() to allocates the virtual address space in
advance.

Avoid the use of apply_to_page_range() by using saving and using the
array of PTE addresses from the alloc_vm_area() call (which ensures
that the required page tables are pre-allocated).
