ASoC: Remove runtime field from DAI

This was initially removed in commit 6423c1875 ("ASoC: Remove runtime field from
DAI"), but was, presumably by accident, brought back in commit f0fba2ad1 ("ASoC:
multi-component - ASoC Multi-Component Support"). But has never been
initialized to anything but NULL ever since. This commit removes it again.
