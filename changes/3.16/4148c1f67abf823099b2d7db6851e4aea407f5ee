lz4: fix another possible overrun

There is one other possible overrun in the lz4 code as implemented by
Linux at this point in time (which differs from the upstream lz4
codebase, but will get synced at in a future kernel release.)  As
pointed out by Don, we also need to check the overflow in the data
itself.

While we are at it, replace the odd error return value with just a
"simple" -1 value as the return value is never used for anything other
than a basic "did this work or not" check.
