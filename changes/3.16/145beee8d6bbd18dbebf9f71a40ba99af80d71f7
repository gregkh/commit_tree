bridge: Add addresses from static fdbs to non-promisc ports

When a static fdb entry is created, add the mac address
from this fdb entry to any ports that are currently running
in non-promiscuous mode.  These ports need this data so that
they can receive traffic destined to these addresses.
By default ports start in promiscuous mode, so this feature
is disabled.
