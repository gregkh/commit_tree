ip_tunnel: fix i_key matching in ip_tunnel_find

Some tunnels (though only vti as for now) can use i_key just for internal use:
for example vti uses it for fwmark'ing incoming packets. So raw i_key value
shouldn't be treated as a distinguisher for them. ip_tunnel_key_match exists for
cases when we want to compare two ip_tunnel_parms' i_keys.

Example bug:
ip link add type vti ikey 1 local 1.0.0.1 remote 2.0.0.2
ip link add type vti ikey 2 local 1.0.0.1 remote 2.0.0.2
spawned two tunnels, although it doesn't make sense.
