KVM: x86: IN instruction emulation should ignore REP-prefix

The IN instruction is not be affected by REP-prefix as INS is.  Therefore, the
emulation should ignore the REP prefix as well.  The current emulator
implementation tries to perform writeback when IN instruction with REP-prefix
is emulated. This causes it to perform wrong memory write or spurious #GP
exception to be injected to the guest.
