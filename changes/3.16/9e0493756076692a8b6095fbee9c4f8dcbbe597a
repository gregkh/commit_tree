powerpc/eeh: Remove EEH_PE_PHB_DEAD

The PE state (for eeh_pe instance) EEH_PE_PHB_DEAD is duplicate to
EEH_PE_ISOLATED. Originally, those PHBs (PHB PE) with EEH_PE_PHB_DEAD
would be removed from the system. However, it's safe to replace
that with EEH_PE_ISOLATED.

The patch also clear EEH_PE_RECOVERING after fenced PHB has been handled,
either failure or success. It makes the PHB PE state consistent with:

	PHB functions normally		  NONE
	PHB has been removed		  EEH_PE_ISOLATED
	PHB fenced, recovery in progress  EEH_PE_ISOLATED | RECOVERING
