ath10k: get rid of pci_assign_resource() call from pci_probe

On ARM-based (MSM mach), the pci_assign_resource() is passing
some invalid pointers and leading to L2 cache errors,
what prevents the PCI communication completly.

So far I have not found this funtion to be directly called by
any other wifi driver and did not found this assigning needed
on any other platform. So removing it completely.
