x86, irq, pic: Probe for legacy PIC and set legacy_pic appropriately

The legacy PIC may or may not be available and we need a mechanism to
detect the existence of the legacy PIC that is applicable for all
hardware (both physical as well as virtual) currently supported by
Linux.

On Hyper-V, when our legacy firmware presented to the guests, emulates
the legacy PIC while when our EFI based firmware is presented we do
not emulate the PIC. To support Hyper-V EFI firmware, we had to set
the legacy_pic to the null_legacy_pic since we had to bypass PIC based
calibration in the early boot code. While, on the EFI firmware, we
know we don't emulate the legacy PIC, we need a generic mechanism to
detect the presence of the legacy PIC that is not based on boot time
state - this became apparent when we tried to get kexec to work on
Hyper-V EFI firmware.

This patch implements the proposal put forth by H. Peter Anvin
<hpa@linux.intel.com>: Write a known value to the PIC data port and
read it back. If the value read is the value written, we do have the
PIC, if not there is no PIC and we can safely set the legacy_pic to
null_legacy_pic. Since the read from an unconnected I/O port returns
0xff, we will use ~(1 << PIC_CASCADE_IR) (0xfb: mask all lines except
the cascade line) to probe for the existence of the PIC.

In version V1 of the patch, I had cleaned up the code based on comments from Peter.
In version V2 of the patch, I have addressed additional comments from Peter.
In version V3 of the patch, I have addressed Jan's comments (JBeulich@suse.com).
In version V4 of the patch, I have addressed additional comments from Peter.
