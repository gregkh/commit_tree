efi: create memory map iteration helper

There are a lot of places in the kernel which iterate through an
EFI memory map. Most of these places use essentially the same
for-loop code. This patch adds a for_each_efi_memory_desc()
helper to clean up all of the existing duplicate code and avoid
more in the future.
