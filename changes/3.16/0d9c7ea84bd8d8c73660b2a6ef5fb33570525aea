i40evf: make messages less dire

Depending on the timing of what the PF driver is doing, it make take a
few tries before the VF driver is able to communicate with the PF driver
on init or reset recovery. In order to prevent confusion, make the most
common messages less scary by lowering them to a less terrifying log
level and indicate that the driver will retry.
