sched: Add a new SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN for sched_domain

A new flag SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN is created to reflect whether groups of CPUs
in a sched_domain level can or not reach different power state. As an example,
the flag should be cleared at CPU level if groups of cores can be power gated
independently. This information can be used in the load balance decision or to
add load balancing level between group of CPUs that can power gate
independantly.
This flag is part of the topology flags that can be set by arch.
