ASoC: Add ADAU1361/ADAU1761 audio CODEC support

This patch adds support for the Analog Devices ADAU1361 and ADAU1761 CODECs.
The device is a a low-power, 24-bit stereo audio CODEC with multiple analog
input and outputs, one digital microphone input and an I2S interface. The device
can be controlled either via I2C or SPI. The main difference between the two
variants is that the ADAU1761 has a built-in SigmaDSP, while the ADAU1361 has
not.
