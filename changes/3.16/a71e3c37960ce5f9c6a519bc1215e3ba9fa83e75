net: phy: Set the driver when registering an MDIO bus device

mdiobus_register() registers a device which is already bound to a driver.
Hence, the driver pointer should be set properly in order to track down
the driver associated to the MDIO bus.

This will be used to allow ethernet driver to pin down a MDIO bus driver,
preventing it from being unloaded while the PHY device is running.
