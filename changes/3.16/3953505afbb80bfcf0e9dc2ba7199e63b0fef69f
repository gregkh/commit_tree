ARM: dts: keystone: add cell's information to i2c nodes

I2C nodes should always have #address-cells and #size-cells defined,
otherwise warnings will be produced in case of adding child
nodes to the I2C bus in DT:
Warning (avoid_default_addr_size): Relying on default #address-cells value for /soc/i2c@2530800/pca@20
Warning (avoid_default_addr_size): Relying on default #size-cells value for /soc/i2c@2530800/pca@20

Hence, ensure that all i2cX nodes have #address-cells and #size-cells
properties defined.
