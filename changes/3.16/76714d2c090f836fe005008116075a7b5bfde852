mfd: twl4030-power: Add recommended idle configuration

These settings are based on the "Recommended Sleep Sequences for
the Zoom Platform".

The settings assume most of the regulators are under control of
Linux, and twl4030 only cuts off VDD1 and VDD2 during off-idle as
Linux cannot do it.

For any board specific changes to these, let's patch them in as
changes to the generic data in the follow-up patches. This keeps
the board specific changes small.

Note that this does not consider the twl5030 errata 27 and 28.
That can be added later on after it has been tested. For more
information about errata 27 and 28.
