drm: convert crtc and connection_mutex to ww_mutex (v5)

For atomic, it will be quite necessary to not need to care so much
about locking order.  And 'state' gives us a convenient place to stash a
ww_ctx for any sort of update that needs to grab multiple crtc locks.

Because we will want to eventually make locking even more fine grained
(giving locks to planes, connectors, etc), split out drm_modeset_lock
and drm_modeset_acquire_ctx to track acquired locks.

Atomic will use this to keep track of which locks have been acquired
in a transaction.

v1: original
v2: remove a few things not needed until atomic, for now
v3: update for v3 of connection_mutex patch..
v4: squash in docbook
v5: doc tweaks/fixes
