    drm/i915: Do not call retire_requests from wait_for_rendering

is that we can completely fill all of memory using small objects, such
that we exhaust the filp space, and spend all of our time evicting
objects from the aperture. As such, we never fill the ring, and never
trigger the last resort flushing in

    drm/i915: Flush request queue when waiting for ring space

active reference. Eventually the system comes to a halt as it runs out
of memory.

The impact is mainly limited to test cases as regular userspace will
trigger retirement by manually checking whether an object is active.
