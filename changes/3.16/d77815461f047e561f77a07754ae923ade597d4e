btrfs: Avoid trucating page or punching hole in a already existed hole.

btrfs_punch_hole() will truncate unaligned pages or punch hole on a
already existed hole.
This will cause unneeded zero page or holes splitting the original huge
hole.

This patch will skip already existed holes before any page truncating or
hole punching.
