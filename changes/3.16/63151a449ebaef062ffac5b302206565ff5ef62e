blk-mq: allow drivers to hook into I/O completion

Split out the bottom half of blk_mq_end_io so that drivers can perform
work when they know a request has been completed, but before it has been
freed.  This also obsoletes blk_mq_end_io_partial as drivers can now
pass any value to blk_update_request directly.
