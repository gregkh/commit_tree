tipc: use bearer_disable to disable bearer in tipc_l2_device_event

As bearer pointer is known in tipc_l2_device_event(), it's unnecessary
to search it again in tipc_disable_bearer(). If tipc_disable_bearer()
is replaced with bearer_disable() in tipc_l2_device_event(), this will
help us save a bit time when bearer is disabled.
