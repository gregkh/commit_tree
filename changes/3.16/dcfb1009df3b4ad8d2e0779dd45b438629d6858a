drm/nv50-/mc: fix kms pageflip events by reordering irq handling order.

Whenever a single nouveau_mc_intr() main gpu irq-handler invocation was
responsible for calling both, the vblank-irq handler (display engine irq)
and kms-pageflip completion handler (from fifo irq), the order of
invocation was wrong. nouveau_finish_flip() was called before
drm_handle_vblank() for the vblank of pageflip completion, so the
emitted pageflip event contained stale vblank count and timestamp
from previous vblank. This caused failure in userspace to timestamp
properly.

Reorder order of invocation of engine irq handlers: Put
NVDEV_ENGINE_DISP always on top, and thereby before NVDEV_ENGINE_FIFO,
so that drm_handle_vblank() gets called to update vblank timestamps
and count before potential pageflip events make use of that
information.

This works on nv-50 and later, where kms-pageflip completion triggers
an irq either after a separate vblank irq, or both pageflip and vblank
trigger one common irq invocation, but never before vblank irqs.

v2 (Ben):
- removed mods for nv04-nv40, it doesn't help there anyway
- this is considered a hack, and a better solution should be found
