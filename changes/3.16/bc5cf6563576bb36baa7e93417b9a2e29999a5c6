staging: vt6655: fix checkpatch bracing issues

This patchs fixes tons of warnings such as:

  WARNING: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
  #354: FILE: drivers/staging/vt6655/wmgr.c:354:
  +       for (ii = 0; ii < WLAN_BSSID_LEN; ii++) {
  +               pMgmt->abyDesireBSSID[ii] = 0xFF;
  +       }

Please note: this patch only fixes bracing issues (and there is still a
lot to do); so if you run checkpatch it _will_ throw a lot of errors.
Use --test-only=braces
