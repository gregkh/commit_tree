ACPI / resources: only reject zero length resources based at address zero

The recently merged change (in v3.14-rc6) to ACPI resource detection
(below) causes all zero length ACPI resources to be elided from the
table:

    ACPI / resources: ignore invalid ACPI device resources

This change has caused a regression in (at least) serial port detection
for a number of machines (see LP#1313981 [1]).  These seem to represent
their IO regions (presumably incorrectly) as a zero length region.
Reverting the above commit restores these serial devices.

Only elide zero length resources which lie at address 0.
