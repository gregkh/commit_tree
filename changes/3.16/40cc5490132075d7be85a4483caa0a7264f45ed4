cpufreq: tegra: update comment for clarity

Tegra's driver got updated a bit (00917dd cpufreq: Tegra: implement intermediate
frequency callbacks) and implements new 'intermediate freq' infrastructure of
core. Above commit updated comments about when to call
clk_prepare_enable(pll_x_clk) and Doug wasn't satisfied with those comments and
said this:

> The "Though when target-freq is intermediate freq, we don't need to
> take this reference." makes me think that this function is actually
> called when target-freq is intermediate freq. Â I don't think it is,
> right?

For better clarity just make that comment more explicit about when we call
tegra_target_intermediate().
