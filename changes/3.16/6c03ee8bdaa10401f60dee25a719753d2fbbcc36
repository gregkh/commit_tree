bridge: fix smatch warning / potential null pointer dereference

"New smatch warnings:
  net/bridge/br_multicast.c:1368 br_ip6_multicast_query() error:
    we previously assumed 'group' could be null (see line 1349)"

In the rare (sort of broken) case of a query having a Maximum
Response Delay of zero, we could create a potential null pointer
dereference.

Fixing this by skipping the multicast specific MLD Query parsing again
if no multicast group address is available.

("bridge: adhere to querier election mechanism specified by RFCs")
