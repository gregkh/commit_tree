drbd: Break a deadlock while concurrent fencing and establishing a connection

When we need to outdate the peer while being promoted to primary,
and the connection gets established at the same time, we deadlock
in drbd_try_outdate_peer() when trying to clear the susp_fen
bit.

Fix this by setting the STATE_SENT bit while holding the mutex.

Using drbd_change_state(.. , CS_HARD, ..) which does not block
until STATE_SENT is cleared, is only for clearness. It does
not contribute anything to the fix.
