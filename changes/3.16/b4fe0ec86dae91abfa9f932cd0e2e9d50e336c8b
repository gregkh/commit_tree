MIPS: bpf: Fix PKT_TYPE case for big-endian cores

The skb->pkt_type field is defined as follows:

u8 pkt_type:3,
   fclone:2,
   ipvs_property:1,
   peeked:1,
   nf_trace:1

resulting to the following layout in big-endian systems

[pkt_type][fclone][ipvs_propery][peeked][nf_trace]
^                                                ^
|                                                |
LSB                                             MSB

As a result, the existing code did not work because it was trying to
match pkt_type == 7 whereas in reality it is 7<<5 on big-endian
systems.

This has been fixed in the interpreter in
0dcceabb0c1bf2d4c12a748df9933fad303072a7
"net: filter: fix SKF_AD_PKTTYPE extension on big-endian"

The fix is to look for 7<<5 on big-endian systems for the pkt_type
field, and shift by 5 so the packet type will be at the lower 3 bits
of the A register.
