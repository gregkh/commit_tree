arm64: Clean up the default pgprot setting

The primary aim of this patchset is to remove the pgprot_default and
prot_sect_default global variables and rely strictly on predefined
values. The original goal was to be able to run SMP kernels on UP
hardware by not setting the Shareability bit. However, it is unlikely to
see UP ARMv8 hardware and even if we do, the Shareability bit is no
longer assumed to disable cacheable accesses.

A side effect is that the device mappings now have the Shareability
attribute set. The hardware, however, should ignore it since Device
accesses are always Outer Shareable.

Following the removal of the two global variables, there is some PROT_*
macro reshuffling and cleanup, including the __PAGE_* macros (replaced
by PAGE_*).
