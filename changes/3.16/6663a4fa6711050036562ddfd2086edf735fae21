powerpc: Don't skip ePAPR spin-table CPUs

Commit 59a53afe70fd530040bdc69581f03d880157f15a "powerpc: Don't setup
CPUs with bad status" broke ePAPR SMP booting.  ePAPR says that CPUs
that aren't presently running shall have status of disabled, with
enable-method being used to determine whether the CPU can be enabled.

Fix by checking for spin-table, which is currently the only supported
enable-method.
