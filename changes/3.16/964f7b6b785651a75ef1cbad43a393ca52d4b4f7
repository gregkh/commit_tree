ftrace/x86: Call text_ip_addr() instead of the duplicated code

I just went over this when looking at some Xen-related ftrace initialization
problems. They were related to Xen code that is not upstream but this clean up
would make sense here.

I think that this was already the intention when text_ip_addr() was introduced
in the commit 87fbb2ac6073a703930 (ftrace/x86: Use breakpoints for converting
function graph caller). Anyway, better do it now before it shots people into
their leg ;-)
