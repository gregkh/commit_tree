tools lib traceevent: Add options to plugins

The traceevent plugins allows developers to have their events print out
information that is more advanced than what can be achieved by the
trace event format files.

As these plugins are used on the userspace side of the tracing tools, it
is only logical that the tools should be able to produce different types
of output for the events. The types of events still need to be defined by
the plugins thus we need a way to pass information from the tool to the
plugin to specify what type of information to be shown.

Not only does the information need to be passed by the tool to plugin, but
the plugin also requires a way to notify the tool of what options it can
provide.

This builds the plugin option infrastructure that is taken from trace-cmd
that is used to allow plugins to produce different output based on the
options specified by the tool.
