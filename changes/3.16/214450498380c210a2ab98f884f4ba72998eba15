In case of legacy scan, adapter->curr_cmd is guranteed to be
non-NULL in check_next_scan_cmd. This may not be case in
extended scan where scan command response would come earlier and
set curr_cmd to NULL. Extended scan event comes later and while
trying to complete IOCTL for scan, driver would crash in
dereferencing adapter->curr_cmd->wait_q_enabled.

Avoid this by completing IOCTL in case of legacy scans only.
Internal scan would be completed while handling extended scan
command response.
