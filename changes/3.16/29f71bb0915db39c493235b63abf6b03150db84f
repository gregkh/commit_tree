i40e: Delete stale MAC filters after change

Delete all the old and stale MAC filters for the VF VSI when the host
administrator changes the VF MAC address from under its feet.  Also don't
bother to add a filter for the VSI when its going to go away anyway.
Just record the new address and punch the VF reset.
