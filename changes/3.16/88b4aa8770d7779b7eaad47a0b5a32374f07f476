drm/i915: add flags to i915_ring_stop

Piglit runner and QA are both looking at the dmesg for
DRM_ERRORs with test cases. Add a flag to control those
when we they are expected from related test cases.

Also add flag to control if contexts should be banned
that introduced the hang. Hangcheck is timer based and
preventing bans by adding sleeps to testcases makes
testing slower.

v2: intel_ring_stopped(), readable comment (Chris)
v3: keep compatibility (Daniel)
