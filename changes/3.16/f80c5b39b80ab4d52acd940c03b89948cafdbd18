sched/idle, x86: Switch from TS_POLLING to TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG

Standardize the idle polling indicator to TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG such that
both TIF_NEED_RESCHED and TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG are in the same word.
This will allow us, using fetch_or(), to both set NEED_RESCHED and
check for POLLING_NRFLAG in a single operation and avoid pointless
wakeups.

Changing from the non-atomic thread_info::status flags to the atomic
thread_info::flags shouldn't be a big issue since most polling state
changes were followed/preceded by a full memory barrier anyway.

Also, fix up the apm_32 idle function, clearly that was forgotten in
the last conversion. The default idle state is !POLLING so just kill
the lot.
