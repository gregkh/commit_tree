tools/liblockdep: Account for bitfield changes in lockdeps lock_acquire

Commit fb9edbe984 shortened held_lock->check from a 2-bit field
to a 1-bit field.

Make liblockdep compatible with the new definition by passing check=1
to lock_acquire() calls, rather than the old value check=2 (which
inadvertently disabled checks by overflowing to 0).

Without this fix, several of the test cases in liblockdep run_tests.sh
were failing.
