regulator: arizona-ldo1: add missing #include

commit 2cce4be9e6b8 "regulator: arizona-ldo1: Add processing of init_data
from device tree" added a call to of_get_child_by_name() but
did not add an #include to the header file declaring that function.

I got a build error when doing randconfig testing on this, which
is fixed by this patch to include of.h.

drivers/regulator/arizona-ldo1.c:192:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'of_get_child_by_name' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/regulator/arizona-ldo1.c:193:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'of_parse_phandle' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/regulator/arizona-ldo1.c:213:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'of_node_put' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
