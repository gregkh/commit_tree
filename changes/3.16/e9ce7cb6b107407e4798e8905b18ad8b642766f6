xen-netback: Factor queue-specific data into queue struct

In preparation for multi-queue support in xen-netback, move the
queue-specific data from struct xenvif into struct xenvif_queue, and
update the rest of the code to use this.

Also adds loops over queues where appropriate, even though only one is
configured at this point, and uses alloc_netdev_mq() and the
corresponding multi-queue netif wake/start/stop functions in preparation
for multiple active queues.

Finally, implements a trivial queue selection function suitable for
ndo_select_queue, which simply returns 0 for a single queue and uses
skb_get_hash() to compute the queue index otherwise.
