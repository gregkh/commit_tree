mac80211: fix racy usage of chanctx->refcount

Channel context refcount is protected by
chanctx_mtx. Accessing the value without holding
the mutex is racy. RCU section didn't guarantee
anything here.

Theoretically ieee80211_channel_switch() could
fail to see refcount change and read "1" instead
of, e.g. "2". This means mac80211 could accept CSA
even though it shouldn't have.
