drm: Add 800x600 (SVGA) screen resolution to the built-in EDIDs

The 800x600 (SVGA) screen resolution was lacking in the set of
built-in selectable EDID screen resolutions that can be used to
repair misbehaving monitor firmware.

This patch adds the related data set and expands the documentation.
Note that the SVGA bit occupies a different byte to all the existing
users of the established timing bits forcing a rework of the
ESTABLISHED_TIMINGS_BITS macro.

Tested new EDID on an aged (and misbehaving) industrial LCD panel;
existing EDIDs still pass edid-decode's checksum checks.
