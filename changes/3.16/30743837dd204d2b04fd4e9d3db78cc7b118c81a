net: filter: make register naming more comprehensible

The current code is a bit hard to parse on which registers can be used,
how they are mapped and all play together. It makes much more sense to
define this a bit more clearly so that the code is a bit more intuitive.
This patch cleans this up, and makes naming a bit more consistent among
the code. This also allows for moving some of the defines into the header
file. Clearing of A and X registers in __sk_run_filter() do not get a
particular register name assigned as they have not an 'official' function,
but rather just result from the concrete initial mapping of old BPF
programs. Since for BPF helper functions for BPF_CALL we already use
small letters, so be consistent here as well. No functional changes.
