tty: serial: men_z135_uart: Don't activate TX Space available IRQ on startup

Don't activate the TX Space available IRQ on startup, or a simple
$ cat /dev/ttyHSU0
will cause an endless amount of IRQs, as there is always space in
the TX FIFO available if no data is going to be sent.

Also correct comments for IRQ names (RX and TX swapped).
