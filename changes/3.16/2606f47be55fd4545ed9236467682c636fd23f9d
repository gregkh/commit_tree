ARM: shmobile: Sync Genmai DTS with Genmai reference DTS

Copy the device nodes from Genmai reference into the Genmai device tree
file. This will allow us to use a single DTS file regardless of kernel
configuration. In case of legacy C board code the device nodes may or
may not be used, but in the multiplatform case all the DT device nodes
will be used.
