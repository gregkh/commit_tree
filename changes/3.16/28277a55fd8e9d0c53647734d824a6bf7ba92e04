staging: slicoss: fail on corrupt eeprom

Remove fail_on_bad_eeprom, which was always 0 and thus being used
to ignore incorrect checksumming. This means devices with corrupt
eeprom will now cause the driver to fail.

Since fail_on_bad_eeprom was the last member in use of struct
slic_reg_params, remove that struct altogether.
