scsi: ufs: Improve UFS fatal error handling

Error handling in UFS driver is broken and resets the host controller
for fatal errors without re-initialization. Correct the fatal error
handling sequence according to UFS Host Controller Interface (HCI)
v1.1 specification.

o Processed requests which are completed w/wo error are reported to
  SCSI layer and any pending commands that are not started are aborted
  in the controller and re-queued into scsi mid-layer queue.

o Upon determining fatal error condition the host controller may hang
  forever until a reset is applied. Block SCSI layer for sending new
  requests and apply reset in a separate error handling work.

o SCSI is informed about the expected Unit-Attention exception from the
  device for the immediate command after a reset so that the SCSI layer
  take necessary steps to establish communication with the device.
