cgroup: convert "tasks" and "cgroup.procs" handle to use cftype->write()

cgroup_tasks_write() and cgroup_procs_write() are currently using
cftype->write_u64().  This patch converts them to use cftype->write()
instead.  This allows access to the associated kernfs_open_file which
will be necessary to implement the planned kernfs active protection
manipulation for these files.

This shifts buffer parsing to attach_task_by_pid() and makes it return
@nbytes on success.  Let's rename it to __cgroup_procs_write() to
clearly indicate that this is a write handler implementation.

This patch doesn't introduce any visible behavior changes.
