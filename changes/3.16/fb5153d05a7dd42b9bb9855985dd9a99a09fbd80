powerpc: powernv: Implement ppc_md.get_proc_freq()

Implement a method named pnv_get_proc_freq(unsigned int cpu) which
returns the current clock rate on the 'cpu' in Hz to be reported in
/proc/cpuinfo. This method uses the value reported by cpufreq when
such a value is sane. Otherwise it falls back to old way of reporting
the clockrate, i.e. ppc_proc_freq.

Set the ppc_md.get_proc_freq() hook to pnv_get_proc_freq() on the
PowerNV platform.
