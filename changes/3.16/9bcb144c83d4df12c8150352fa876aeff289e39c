drm/i915: Support 64b execbuf

Previously, our code only had a 32b offset value for where the
batchbuffer starts. With full PPGTT, and 64b canonical GPU address
space, that is an insufficient value. The code to expand is pretty
straight forward, and only one platform needs to do anything with the
extra bits.
