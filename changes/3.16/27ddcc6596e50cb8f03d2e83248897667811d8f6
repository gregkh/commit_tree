PM / sleep: Add state field to pm_states[] entries

To allow sleep states corresponding to the "mem", "standby" and
"freeze" lables to be different from the pm_states[] indexes of
those strings, introduce struct pm_sleep_state, consisting of
a string label and a state number, and turn pm_states[] into an
array of objects of that type.

This modification should not lead to any functional changes.
