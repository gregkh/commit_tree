Bluetooth: Fix incorrectly overriding conn->src_type

The src_type member of struct hci_conn should always reflect the address
type of the src_member. It should never be overridden. There is already
code in place in the command status handler of HCI_LE_Create_Connection
to copy the right initiator address into conn->init_addr_type.

Without this patch, if privacy is enabled, we will send the wrong
address type in the SMP identity address information PDU (it'll e.g.
contain our public address but a random address type).
