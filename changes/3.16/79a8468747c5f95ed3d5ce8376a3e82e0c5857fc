random: check for increase of entropy_count because of signed conversion

The expression entropy_count -= ibytes << (ENTROPY_SHIFT + 3) could
actually increase entropy_count if during assignment of the unsigned
expression on the RHS (mind the -=) we reduce the value modulo
2^width(int) and assign it to entropy_count. Trinity found this.

[ Commit modified by tytso to add an additional safety check for a
  negative entropy_count -- which should never happen, and to also add
  an additional paranoia check to prevent overly large count values to
  be passed into urandom_read().  ]
