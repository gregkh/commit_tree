ALSA: firewire: Fix dependency on PCM and rawmidi

Now snd-firewire-lib supports rawmidi in addition to PCM, thus we need
to give a proper dependency.  For fixing and simplification, move the
selections of SND_PCM and SND_RAWMIDI into SND_FIREWIRE_LIB section.
Then each driver doesn't have to select them but only
SND_FIREWIRE_LIB.
