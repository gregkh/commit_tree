powerpc/perf: Never program book3s PMCs with values >= 0x80000000

We are seeing a lot of PMU warnings on POWER8:

    Can't find PMC that caused IRQ

Looking closer, the active PMC is 0 at this point and we took a PMU
exception on the transition from negative to 0. Some versions of POWER8
have an issue where they edge detect and not level detect PMC overflows.

A number of places program the PMC with (0x80000000 - period_left),
where period_left can be negative. We can either fix all of these or
just ensure that period_left is always >= 1.

This patch takes the second option.
