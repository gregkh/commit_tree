Revert "Bluetooth: Add a new PID/VID 0cf3/e005 for AR3012."

This reverts commit ca58e594da2486c1d28e7ad547d82266604ec4ce.

For some unclear reason this patch tries to add suport for the
product ID 0xe005, but it ends up adding product ID 0x3005 to
all the tables. This is obviously wrong and causing multiple
issues.

The original patch seemed to be fine, but what ended up in 3.15
is not what the patch intended. The commit 0a3658cccdf53 is
already present and adds support for this hardware. This means
only revert of this broken commit is requird.
