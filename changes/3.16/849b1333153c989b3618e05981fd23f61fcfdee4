usb: gadget: make return of 0 explicit

Delete unnecessary local variable whose value is always 0 and that hides
the fact that the result is always 0.

A simplified version of the semantic patch that fixes this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@r exists@
local idexpression ret;
expression e;
position p;
@@

-ret = 0;
... when != ret = e
return
- ret
+ 0
  ;
// </smpl>
