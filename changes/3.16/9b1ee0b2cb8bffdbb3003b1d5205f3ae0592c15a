ALSA: firewire/bebob: Add a workaround for M-Audio special Firewire series

In post commit, a quirk of this firmware about transactions is reported.
This commit apply a workaround for this quirk.

They often fail transactions due to gap_count mismatch. This state is changed
by generating bus reset.

The fw_schedule_bus_reset() is an exported symbol in firewire-core. But there
are no header for public. This commit moves its prototype from
drivers/firewire/core.h to include/linux/firewire.h.

This mismatch still affects bus management before generating this bus reset.
It still takes a time to call driver's probe() because transactions are still
often failed.
