twl4030-madc: Request processed values in twl4030_get_madc_conversion

Not setting the raw parameter in the request causes it to be randomly
initialized to a value that might be different from zero or zero. This leads to
values that are randomly either raw or processed, making it very difficult to
make reliable use of the values.
