usb: assign default peer ports for root hubs

Assume that the peer of a superspeed port is the port with the same id
on the shared_hcd root hub.  This identification scheme is required of
external hubs by the USB3 spec [1].  However, for root hubs, tier mismatch
may be in effect [2].  Tier mismatch can only be enumerated via platform
firmware.  For now, simply perform the nominal association.

A new lock 'usb_port_peer_mutex' is introduced to synchronize port
device add/remove with peer lookups.  It protects peering against
changes to hcd->shared_hcd, hcd->self.root_hub, hdev->maxchild, and
port_dev->child pointers.
