cpuidle / menu: Return (-1) if there are no suitable states

If there is a PM QoS latency limit and all of the sufficiently shallow
C-states are disabled, the cpuidle menu governor returns 0 which on
some systems is CPUIDLE_DRIVER_STATE_START and shouldn't be returned
if that C-state has been disabled.

Fix the issue by modifying the menu governor to return (-1) in such
situations.
