mtip32xx: Remove dfs_parent after pci unregister

In module exit, dfs_parent and it's subtree were removed before
unregistering with pci. When debugfs entry for each device is attempted
to remove in pci_remove() context, they don't exist, as dfs_parent and
its children were already ripped apart.

Modified to first unregister with pci and then remove dfs_parent.
