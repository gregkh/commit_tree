nfsd4: decoding errors can still be cached and require space

Currently a non-idempotent op reply may be cached if it fails in the
proc code but not if it fails at xdr decoding.  I doubt there are any
xdr-decoding-time errors that would make this a problem in practice, so
this probably isn't a serious bug.

The space estimates should also take into account space required for
encoding of error returns.  Again, not a practical problem, though it
would become one after future patches which will tighten the space
estimates.
