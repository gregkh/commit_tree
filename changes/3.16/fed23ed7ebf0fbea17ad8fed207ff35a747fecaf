powerpc/boot: Use a common prom_args struct in oflib

This patch fixes warnings when the wrapper is compiled in 64bit and
updates the boot wrapper code related to prom to converge with the
kernel code in prom_init. This should make the review of changes easier.

The kernel has a different number of possible arguments (10) when
entering prom. There does not seem to be any good reason to have
12 in the wrapper, so the patch changes this value to args[10] in
the prom_args struct.
