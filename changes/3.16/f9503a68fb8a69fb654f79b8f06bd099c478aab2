ALSA: firewire-lib: Use ARRAY_SIZE() instead of sizeof() for correct loop limit

This commit fixes a big for loop count with array. The limitation of loop
count should be calcurated with the number of elements in the array, not
with the number of bytes.

Aditionally, this commit apply the same declaration as a prototype in header
for the array.
