staging: wlan-ng: fix bad symbol declaration

With sparse, the following error appears :
  CHECK   drivers/staging/wlan-ng/p80211netdev.c
drivers/staging/wlan-ng/cfg80211.c:710:6: warning: symbol 'prism2_connect_result' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/wlan-ng/cfg80211.c:719:6: warning: symbol 'prism2_disconnected' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/wlan-ng/cfg80211.c:725:6: warning: symbol 'prism2_roamed' was not declared. Should it be static?

Move functions declaration to coherent internal header file.
