6lowpan_rtnl: fix fragmentation with two fragments

This patch fix the 6LoWPAN fragmentation for the case if we have exactly
two fragments. The problem is that the (skb_unprocessed >= frag_cap)
condition is always false on the second fragment after sending the first
fragment. A fragmentation with only one fragment doesn't make any sense.
The solution is that we use a do while loop here, that ensures we sending
always a minimum of two fragments if we need a fragmentation.

This issue was introduced by commit d4b2816d67d6e07b2f27037f282d8db03a5829d7
("6lowpan: fix fragmentation").
