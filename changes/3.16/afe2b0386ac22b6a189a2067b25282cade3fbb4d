signals: cleanup the usage of t/current in do_sigaction()

The usage of "task_struct *t" and "current" in do_sigaction() looks really
annoying and chaotic.  Initially "t" is used as a cached value of current
but not consistently, then it is reused as a loop variable and we have to
use "current" again.

Clean up this mess and also convert the code to use for_each_thread().
