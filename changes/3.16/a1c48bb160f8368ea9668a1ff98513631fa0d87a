Makefile: Fix unrecognized cross-compiler command line options

On architectures that setup CROSS_COMPILE in their arch/*/Makefile
(arc, blackfin, m68k, mips, parisc, score, sh, tile, unicore32, xtensa),
cc-option and cc-disable-warning may check against the wrong compiler,
causing errors like

    cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-Wno-maybe-uninitialized"

if the host gcc supports a compiler option, while the cross compiler
doesn't support that option.

Move all logic using cc-option or cc-disable-warning below the inclusion
of the arch's Makefile to fix this.

Introduced by
  - commit e74fc973b6e531fef1fce8b101ffff05ecfb774c ("Turn off
    -Wmaybe-uninitialized when building with -Os"),
  - commit 61163efae02040f66a95c8ed17f4407951ba58fa ("kbuild: LLVMLinux:
    Add Kbuild support for building kernel with Clang").

As -Wno-maybe-uninitialized requires a quite recent gcc (gcc 4.6.3 on
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS doesn't support it), this only showed up recently (gcc
4.8.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS does support it).
