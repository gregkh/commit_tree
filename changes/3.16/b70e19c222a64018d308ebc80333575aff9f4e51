staging: iio/ad7291: fix error code in ad7291_probe()

We should be returning a negative error code instead of success here.

This would have been detected by GCC, except that the "ret" variable was
initialized with a bogus value to disable GCC's uninitialized variable
warnings.  I've cleaned that up, as well.
