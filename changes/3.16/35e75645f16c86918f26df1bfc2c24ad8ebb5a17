ARM: EXYNOS: Update secondary boot addr for secure mode

Almost all Exynos-series of SoCs that run in secure mode don't need
additional offset for every CPU, with Exynos4412 being the only
exception.

Tested on Origen-Quad (Exynos4412) and Arndale-Octa (Exynos5420).

While at it, fix the coding style (space around *).
