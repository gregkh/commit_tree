x86, vdso: Use <tools/le_byteshift.h> for littleendian access

There are no standard functions for littleendian data (unlike
bigendian data.)  Thus, use <tools/le_byteshift.h> to access
littleendian data members.  Those are fairly inefficient, but it
doesn't matter for this purpose (and can be optimized later.)  This
avoids portability problems.
