block: add blk_rq_set_block_pc()

With the optimizations around not clearing the full request at alloc
time, we are leaving some of the needed init for REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC
up to the user allocating the request.

Add a blk_rq_set_block_pc() that sets the command type to
REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC, and properly initializes the members associated
with this type of request. Update callers to use this function instead
of manipulating rq->cmd_type directly.

Includes fixes from Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de> for my half-assed
attempt.
