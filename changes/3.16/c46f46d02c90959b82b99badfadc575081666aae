m68k/mvme16x: Adopt common boot console

In a multi-platform kernel binary we only need one early console instance.

The difficulty here is that the common early console is started by
early_param(), whereas the MVME16x instance is started later by
config_mvme16x(). That means some interrupt setup must be done earlier.
