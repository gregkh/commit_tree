net: Generalize checksum_init functions

Create a general __skb_checksum_validate function (actually a
macro) to subsume the various checksum_init functions. This
function can either init the checksum, or do the full validation
(logically checksum_init+skb_check_complete)-- a flag specifies
if full vaidation is performed. Also, there is a flag to the function
to indicate that zero checksums are allowed (to support optional
UDP checksums).

Added several stub functions for calling __skb_checksum_validate.
