ARM: mvebu: fix big endian booting after coherency code rework

As part of the introduction of the cpuidle support for Armada XP, the
coherency code was significantly reworked, especially in the
coherency_ll.S file. However, when the ll_get_cpuid function was
created, the big-endian specific code that switches the endianess of
the register was not updated properly.

This patch fixes this code, and therefore makes big endian systems
bootable again.
