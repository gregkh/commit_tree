staging/lustre/ptlrpc: don't try to recover no_recov connection

If a connection has been stopped with ptlrpc_pinger_del_import() and
marked obd_no_recov, don't reconnect in ptlrpc_disconnect_import() if
the import is already disconnected.  Otherwise, without the pinger it
will just wait there indefinitely for the reconnection that will never
happen.

Put the obd_no_recov check inside ptlrpc_import_in_recovery() so that
any threads waiting on the connection to recover would also be broken
out of their sleep if obd_no_recov is set.
