xhci: Fix sleeping with IRQs disabled in xhci_stop_device()

xhci_stop_device() allocates and issues stop commands for each active endpoint.
This is done with spinlock held and interrupt disabled so we can't sleep during
memory allocation. Use GFP_NOWAIT instead

Regression from commit ddba5cd0aeff5bbed92ebdf4b1223300b0541e78
"xhci: Use command structures when queuing commands on the command ring"
for 3.16-rc1
