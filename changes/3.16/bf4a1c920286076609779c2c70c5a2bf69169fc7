iommu/exynos: Add devices attached to the System MMU to an IOMMU group

Patch written by Antonios Motakis <a.motakis@virtualopensystems.com>:

IOMMU groups are expected by certain users of the IOMMU API,
e.g. VFIO. Since each device is behind its own System MMU, we
can allocate a new IOMMU group for each device.
