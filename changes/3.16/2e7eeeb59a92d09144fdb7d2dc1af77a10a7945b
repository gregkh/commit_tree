drm/i915: set backlight duty cycle after backlight enable for gen4

For reasons I can't claim to fully understand gen4 seems to require
backlight duty cycle setting after the backlight has been enabled, or
else black screen follows. I don't have documentation for the correct
sequence on gen4 either. Confirmed on Dell Latitude D630 and MacBook4,1.

This fixes a regression introduced by
