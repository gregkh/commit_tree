mac80211: allow reservation of a running chanctx

With single-channel drivers, we need to be able to change a running
chanctx if we want to use chanctx reservation.  Not all drivers may be
able to do this, so add a flag that indicates support for it.

Changing a running chanctx can also be used as an optimization in
multi-channel drivers when the context needs to be reserved for future
usage.

Introduce IEEE80211_CHANCTX_RESERVED chanctx mode to mark a channel as
reserved so nobody else can use it (since we know it's going to
change).  In the future, we may allow several vifs to use the same
reservation as long as they plan to use the chanctx on the same
future channel.
