ASoC: pxa: remove mach header dependency

As we are moving the mmp platform towards multiplatform support,
we have to stop including platform header files.

This changes the pxa-ssp sound driver file to no longer depend
on mach/hardware.h and mach/dma.h. The code using the definitions
from those headers is actually gone already, the only thing
that was still being used was the pxa_dma_desc typedef, which
we can easily work around by using the normal 'struct pxa_dma_desc'
name.

The pxa2xx-dma driver still uses this header, so we include it
explicitly there, which is ok because that is only used on pxa,
not on mmp.
