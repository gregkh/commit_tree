ahci: Add Device ID for HighPoint RocketRaid 642L

This device normally comes with a proprietary driver, using a web GUI
to configure RAID:

But thankfully it also works out of the box with the AHCI driver,
being just a Marvell 88SE9235.

Devices 640L, 644L, 644LS should also be supported but not tested here.
