sunvnet: clean up objects created in vnet_new() on vnet_exit()

Nothing cleans up the objects created by
vnet_new(), they are completely leaked.

vnet_exit(), after doing the vio_unregister_driver() to clean
up ports, should call a helper function that iterates over vnet_list
and cleans up those objects. This includes unregister_netdevice()
as well as free_netdev().
