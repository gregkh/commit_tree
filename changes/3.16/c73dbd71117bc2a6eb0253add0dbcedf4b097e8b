ARM: dts: i.MX51 babbage: Fix FEC pad ctrl settings

The dts relied on the FEC pad ctrl settings from the bootloader by
using the NO_PAD_CTRL option. This breaks once the bootloader starts
initializing the pad ctrl settings from the same dts file. Change
to real pad ctrl settings taken from the platform based babbage
support.
