perf tools: Update cpumode for each cumulative entry

The cpumode and level in struct addr_localtion was set for a sample
and but updated as cumulative callchains were added.  This led to have
non-matching symbol and cpumode in the output.

Update it accordingly based on the fact whether the map is a part of
the kernel or not.  This is a reverse of what thread__find_addr_map()
does.
