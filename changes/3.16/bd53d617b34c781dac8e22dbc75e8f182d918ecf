cgroup: allow cgroup creation and suppress automatic css creation in the unified hierarchy

Now that effective css handling has been added and iterators updated
accordingly, it's safe to allow cgroup creation in the default
hierarchy.  Unblock cgroup creation in the default hierarchy.

As the default hierarchy will implement explicit enabling and
disabling of controllers on each cgroup, suppress automatic css
enabling on cgroup creation.
