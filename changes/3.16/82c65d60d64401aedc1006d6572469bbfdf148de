sched/idle: Clear polling before descheduling the idle thread

Currently, the only real guarantee provided by the polling bit is
that, if you hold rq->lock and the polling bit is set, then you can
set need_resched to force a reschedule.

The only reason the lock is needed is that the idle thread might not
be running at all when setting its need_resched bit, and rq->lock
keeps it pinned.

This is easy to fix: just clear the polling bit before scheduling.
Now the idle thread's polling bit is only ever set when
rq->curr == rq->idle.
