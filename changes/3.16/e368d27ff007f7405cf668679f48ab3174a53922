net: cdc_ncm: drop ethtool coalesce support

The ethtool coalesce API is not applicable for this driver. Forcing
it to fit the NCM aggregation redefined the API in a driver specific
way, which is much worse than defining a clean new API. These ethtool
coalesce functions have therefore been replaced by a new sysfs API.
