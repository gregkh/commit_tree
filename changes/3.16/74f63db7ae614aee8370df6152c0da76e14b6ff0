staging: comedi: mite: pass subdevice to mite_sync_input_dma()

`mite_sync_input_dma()` in the "mite" module currently takes a pointer
to a `struct comedi_async` and gets a pointer to the owning `struct
comedi_subdevice` from the `subdevice` member.  Change it to take a
pointer to a `struct comedi_subdevice` and use the `async` member.

The motivation for this is to eliminate the `subdevice` member of
`struct comedi_async`.
