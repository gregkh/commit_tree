PM / hibernate: Fix memory corruption in resumedelay_setup()

In the original code "resume_delay" is an int so on 64 bits, the call to
kstrtoul() will cause memory corruption.  We may as well fix a style
issue here as well and make "resume_delay" unsigned int, since that's
what we pass to ssleep().
