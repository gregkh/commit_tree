arm/xen: Remove definiition of virt_to_pfn in asm/xen/page.h

virt_to_pfn has been defined in asm/memory.h by the commit e26a9e0 "ARM: Better
virt_to_page() handling"

This will result of a compilation warning when CONFIG_XEN is enabled.

arch/arm/include/asm/xen/page.h:80:0: warning: "virt_to_pfn" redefined [enabled by default]
 #define virt_to_pfn(v)          (PFN_DOWN(__pa(v)))
 ^
In file included from arch/arm/include/asm/page.h:163:0,
                 from arch/arm/include/asm/xen/page.h:4,
                 from include/xen/page.h:4,
                 from arch/arm/xen/grant-table.c:33:

The definition in memory.h is nearly the same (it directly expand PFN_DOWN),
so we can safely drop virt_to_pfn in xen include.
