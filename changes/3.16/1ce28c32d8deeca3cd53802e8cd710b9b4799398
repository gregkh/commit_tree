ACPICA: OSL: Add configurability for debug output functions.

This patch extends ACPI_HW_DEPENDENT_x mechanism to all debugging output
related functions so that the OSPMs can have full control to configure
them into stub functions.

This patch doesn't include code for Linux to use this new mechanism, thus
no functional change.  Lv Zheng.
