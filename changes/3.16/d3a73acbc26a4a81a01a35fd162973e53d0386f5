s390: split TIF bits into CIF, PIF and TIF bits

The oi and ni instructions used in entry[64].S to set and clear bits
in the thread-flags are not guaranteed to be atomic in regard to other
CPUs. Split the TIF bits into CPU, pt_regs and thread-info specific
bits. Updates on the TIF bits are done with atomic instructions,
updates on CPU and pt_regs bits are done with non-atomic instructions.
