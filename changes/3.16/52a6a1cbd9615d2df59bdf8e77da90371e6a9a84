scsi/NCR5380: fix dprintk macro usage and definition

There are three implementations of the core NCR5380 driver and three sets
of debugging macro definitions. And all three implementations use the
NCR5380.h header as well.

Two of the definitions of the dprintk macro accept a variable argument list
whereas the third does not. Standardize on the variable argument list.
