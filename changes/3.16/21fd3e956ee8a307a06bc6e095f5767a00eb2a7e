ALSA: seq: correctly detect input buffer overflow

snd_seq_event_dup returns -ENOMEM in some buffer-full conditions,
but usually returns -EAGAIN. Make -EAGAIN trigger the overflow
condition in snd_seq_fifo_event_in so that the fifo is cleared
and -ENOSPC is returned to userspace as stated in the alsa-lib docs.
