ceph: include time stamp in every MDS request

We recently modified the client/MDS protocol to include a timestamp in the
client request.  This allows ctime updates to follow the client's clock
in most cases, which avoids subtle problems when clocks are out of sync
and timestamps are updated sometimes by the MDS clock (for most requests)
and sometimes by the client clock (for cap writeback).
