drm/i915: Avoid div-by-zero when pixel_multiplier is zero

On certain platforms pixel_multiplier is read out in
.get_pipe_config(), but it also gets used to calculate the
pixel clock in intel_sdvo_get_config(). If the pipe is disable
but some SDVO outputs are active, we may end up dividing by zero
in intel_sdvo_get_config().

To avoid the problem simply check for zero pixel_multiplier and skip
the division. Another attempt at fixing this involved populating
pixel_multiplier to 1 even for disabled pipes, but that triggered a
WARN because SDVO_CMD_GET_CLOCK_RATE_MULT command failed and thus
encoder_pixel_multiplier was left at zero and didn't match
pipe_config->pixel_multiplier.

The "divide by pixel_multiplier" operation got introduced here:

    drm/i915: Fix port_clock and adjusted_mode.clock readout all over

and it has caused a regression on certain machines since they would
hit the div-by-zero during resume.
