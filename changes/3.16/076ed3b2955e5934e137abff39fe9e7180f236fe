drm/i915/chv: Trigger phy common lane reset

During cold boot, the display controller needs to deassert the common
lane reset.  Only do it once during intel_init_dpio for both PHYx2 and
PHYx1.

Besides, assert the common lane reset when disable pll.  This still
to be determined whether need to do it by driver.
