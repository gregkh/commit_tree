drm/i915: Convert gmch platforms over to ilk_crtc_{enable, disable}_planes()

Use the same code for enabling/disabling planes on all platforms. Rename
the functions to reflect that they're no longer specific to any
platform.

For now we leave the plane enable/disable to ccur at the same old
position in the modeset sequence.
