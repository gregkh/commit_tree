blk-mq: add blk_mq_requeue_request

This allows to requeue a request that has been accepted by ->queue_rq
earlier.  This is needed by the SCSI layer in various error conditions.

The existing internal blk_mq_requeue_request is renamed to
__blk_mq_requeue_request as it is a lower level building block for this
funtionality.
