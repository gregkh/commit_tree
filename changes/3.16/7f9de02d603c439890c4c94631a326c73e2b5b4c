bus: omap_l3_noc: add information about the type of operation

Today we get error such as
L3 Custom Error: MASTER MPU TARGET L4PER2

But since the actual instruction triggerring the error Vs the point
at which we report error may not be aligned, it makes sense to try
and provide additional information - example the type of operation
that was attempted to being performed can help narrow the debug down
further.

This helps provide log such as:
L3 Custom Error: MASTER MPU TARGET L4PER2 (Read)
