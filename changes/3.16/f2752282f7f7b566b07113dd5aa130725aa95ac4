drm: Add drm_vblank_on()

drm_vblank_off() will turn off vblank interrupts, but as long as the
refcount is elevated drm_vblank_get() will not re-enable them. This
is a problem is someone is holding a vblank reference while a modeset is
happening, and the driver requires vblank interrupt to work during that
time.

Add drm_vblank_on() as a counterpart to drm_vblank_off() which will
re-enabled vblank interrupts if the refcount is already elevated. This
will allow drivers to choose the specific places in the modeset sequence
at which vblank interrupts get disabled and enabled.
