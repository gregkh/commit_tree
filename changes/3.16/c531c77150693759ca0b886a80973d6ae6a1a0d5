iwlwifi: mvm: Use RCU_INIT_POINTER(x, NULL)

rcu_assign_pointer() ensures that the initialization of a structure is
carried out before storing a pointer to that structure. However, in the
case that NULL is assigned there's no structure to initialize so using
RCU_INIT_POINTER instead is safe and more efficient.
