ASoC: Remove ASoC level IO tracing

The ASoC framework is in the process of migrating all IO operations to regmap.
regmap has its own more sophisticated tracing infrastructure for IO operations,
which means that the ASoC level IO tracing becomes redundant, hence this patch
removes them. There are still a handful of ASoC drivers left that do not use
regmap yet, but hopefully the removal of the ASoC IO tracing will be an
additional incentive to switch to regmap.
