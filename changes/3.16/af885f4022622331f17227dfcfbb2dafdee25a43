arm64: Fix linker script entry point

Change the arm64 linker script ENTRY() command to define _text as the
kernel entry point.

The arm64 boot protocol specifies that the kernel must be entered at the
beginning of the kernel image.  The existing ENTRY() command defined the
symbol stext as the entry point, which emitted an incorrect entry point,
but would not cause a runtime error because the existing entry code
immediately jumps to stext.
