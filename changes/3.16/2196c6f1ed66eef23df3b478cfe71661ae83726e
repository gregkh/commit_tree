powerpc/powernv: Return secondary CPUs to firmware before FW update

Firmware update on PowerNV platform takes several minutes. During
this time one CPU is stuck in FW and the kernel complains about "soft
lockups".

This patch returns all secondary CPUs to firmware before starting
firmware update process.
