kernfs: implement kernfs_root->supers list

Currently, there's no way to find out which super_blocks are
associated with a given kernfs_root.  Let's implement it - the planned
inotify extension to kernfs_notify() needs it.

Make kernfs_super_info point back to the super_block and chain it at
kernfs_root->supers.
