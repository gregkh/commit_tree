cpuidle: cpuidle-cps: add MIPS CPS cpuidle driver

This patch adds a cpuidle driver for systems based around the MIPS
Coherent Processing System (CPS) architecture. It supports four idle
states:

  - The standard MIPS wait instruction.

  - The non-coherent wait, clock gated & power gated states exposed by
    the recently added pm-cps layer.

The pm-cps layer is used to enter all the deep idle states. Since cores
in the clock or power gated states cannot service interrupts, the
gic_send_ipi_single function is modified to send a power up command for
the appropriate core to the CPC in cases where the target CPU has marked
itself potentially incoherent.
