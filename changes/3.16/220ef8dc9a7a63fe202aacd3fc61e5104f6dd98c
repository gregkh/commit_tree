uprobes/x86: Move UPROBE_FIX_SETF logic from arch_uprobe_post_xol() to default_post_xol_op()

UPROBE_FIX_SETF is only needed to handle "popf" correctly but it is
processed by the generic arch_uprobe_post_xol() code. This doesn't
allows us to make ->fixups private for default_xol_ops.

1 Change default_post_xol_op(UPROBE_FIX_SETF) to set ->saved_tf = T.

   "popf" always reads the flags from stack, it doesn't matter if TF
   was set or not before single-step. Ignoring the naming, this is
   even more logical, "saved_tf" means "owned by application" and we
   do not own this flag after "popf".

2. Change arch_uprobe_post_xol() to save ->saved_tf into the local
   "bool send_sigtrap" before ->post_xol().

3. Change arch_uprobe_post_xol() to ignore UPROBE_FIX_SETF and just
   check ->saved_tf after ->post_xol().

With this patch ->fixups and ->rip_rela_target_address are only used
by default_xol_ops hooks, we are ready to remove them from the common
part of arch_uprobe.
