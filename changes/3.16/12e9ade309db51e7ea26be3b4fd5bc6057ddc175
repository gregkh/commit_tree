NFC: trf7970a: Allow different Modulator and SYS_CLK Control register values

Currently the driver writes the same value to the 'Modulator and SYS_CLK
Control' register no matter what RF technology is being used. That works
for now but new RF technologies (e.g., ISO/IEC 14443-B) will require
different values to be written to that register. To support this, add a
member to the trf7970a structure which is set by the RF technology handling
code and used by the framing code when it writes to that register.
