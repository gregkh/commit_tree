x86: enable DMA CMA with swiotlb

The DMA Contiguous Memory Allocator support on x86 is disabled when
swiotlb config option is enabled.  So DMA CMA is always disabled on
x86_64 because swiotlb is always enabled.  This attempts to support for
DMA CMA with enabling swiotlb config option.

The contiguous memory allocator on x86 is integrated in the function
dma_generic_alloc_coherent() which is .alloc callback in nommu_dma_ops
for dma_alloc_coherent().

x86_swiotlb_alloc_coherent() which is .alloc callback in swiotlb_dma_ops
tries to allocate with dma_generic_alloc_coherent() firstly and then
swiotlb_alloc_coherent() is called as a fallback.

The main part of supporting DMA CMA with swiotlb is that changing
x86_swiotlb_free_coherent() which is .free callback in swiotlb_dma_ops
for dma_free_coherent() so that it can distinguish memory allocated by
dma_generic_alloc_coherent() from one allocated by
swiotlb_alloc_coherent() and release it with dma_generic_free_coherent()
which can handle contiguous memory.  This change requires making
is_swiotlb_buffer() global function.

This also needs to change .free callback in the dma_map_ops for amd_gart
and sta2x11, because these dma_ops are also using
dma_generic_alloc_coherent().
