regulator: AXP20x: fix wrong call to of_find_node_by_name

The of_find_node_by_name function will search for a DT node named
"regulators" after the provided np node, but will not ensure that this node
is a child of np.
This might result in retrieving a "regulators" node that is not related to
the axp20x PMIC.
