drm/i915/bdw: Only use 2g GGTT for 32b platforms

Daniel requested in the bug that I use a 3GB fallback size. Since this
is not in the spec as a valid size, I decided against it. We could
potentially add a patch to bump it to 3GB on top of this one.

This probably should be CC: stable - but I'll let the powers that be
decide that one.

Regression from a revert of the revert:
