kbuild: Print the name of the build directory

With commit 9da0763b (kbuild: Use relative path when building in a
subdir of the source tree), the compiler messages include relative
paths. These are however relative to the build directory, not the
directory where make was started. Print the "Entering directory ..."
message once, so that IDEs/editors can find the source files.
