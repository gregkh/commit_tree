perf tools: Add callback function to hist_entry_iter

The new ->add_entry_cb() will be called after an entry was added to
the histogram.  It's used for code sharing between perf report and
perf top.  Note that ops->add_*_entry() should set iter->he properly
in order to call the ->add_entry_cb.

Also pass @arg to the callback function.  It'll be used by perf top
later.
