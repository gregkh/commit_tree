usb: disable port power control if not supported in wHubCharacteristics

A hub indicates whether it supports per-port power control via the
wHubCharacteristics field in its descriptor.  If it is not supported
a hub will still emulate ClearPortPower(PORT_POWER) requests by
stopping the link state machine.  However, since this does not save
power do not bother suspending.

This also consolidates support checks into a
hub_is_port_power_switchable() helper.
