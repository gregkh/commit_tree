sparc32: fix sparse warnings in auxio_32.c

Fix following warnings:
auxio_32.c:23:14: warning: symbol 'auxio_register' was not declared. Should it be static?
auxio_32.c:26:13: warning: symbol 'auxio_probe' was not declared. Should it be static?
auxio_32.c:108:13: warning: symbol 'auxio_power_probe' was not declared. Should it be static?

Add proper decalarations for the above.

The leaves one sparse warning:
auxio_32.c:130:33: warning: cast removes address space of expression

This is here:
    auxio_power_register = (unsigned char *) of_ioremap()

This is __iomem that is removed from return value of of_ioremap()
The pointer is later used without any helpers in process_32.c:
    *auxio_power_register |= AUXIO_POWER_OFF;

It would be simple to introduce a few sbus() helpers.
But as I was not sure this was correct the warning are left as-is.
