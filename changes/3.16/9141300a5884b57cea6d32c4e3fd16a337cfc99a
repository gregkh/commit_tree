arm64: Provide read/write fault information in compat signal handlers

For AArch32, bit 11 (WnR) of the FSR/ESR register is set when the fault
was caused by a write access and applications like Qemu rely on such
information being provided in sigcontext. This patch introduces the
ESR_EL1 tracking for the arm64 kernel faults and sets bit 11 accordingly
in compat sigcontext.
