of: Keep track of populated platform devices

In "Device Tree powered" systems, platform devices are usually massively
populated with of_platform_populate() call, executed at some level of
initcalls, either by generic architecture or by platform-specific code.

There are situations though where certain devices must be created (and
bound with drivers) before all the others. This presents a challenge,
as devices created explicitly would be created again by
of_platform_populate().

This patch tries to solve that issue in a generic way, adding a
"populated" flag for a DT node description. Subsequent
of_platform_populate() will skip such nodes (and its children) in
a similar way to the non-available ones.

This patch also adds of_platform_depopulate() as an operation
complementary to the _populate() one. It removes a platform or an amba
device populated from the Device Tree, together with its all children
(leaving, however, devices without associated of_node untouched)
clearing the "populated" flag on the way.
