tipc: replace config_mutex lock with RTNL lock

There have two paths where we can configure or change bearer status:
one is that bearer is configured from user space with tipc-config
tool; another one is that bearer is changed by notification events
from its attached interface. On the first path, one dedicated
config_mutex lock is guarded; on the latter path, RTNL lock has been
placed to serialize the process of dealing with interface events.
So, if RTNL lock is also used to protect the first path, this will
not only extremely help us simplify current locking policy, but also
config_mutex lock can be deleted as well.
