blk-mq: allow changing of queue depth through sysfs

For request_fn based devices, the block layer exports a 'nr_requests'
file through sysfs to allow adjusting of queue depth on the fly.
Currently this returns -EINVAL for blk-mq, since it's not wired up.
Wire this up for blk-mq, so that it now also always dynamic
adjustments of the allowed queue depth for any given block device
managed by blk-mq.
