powerpc: use libfdt accessors for header data

With libfdt support, we can take advantage of helper accessors in libfdt
for accessing the FDT header data. This makes the code more readable and
makes the FDT blob structure more opaque to the kernel. This also
prepares for removing struct boot_param_header completely.
