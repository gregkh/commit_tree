drm/vmwgfx: Fix incorrect write to read-only register v2:

Commit "drm/vmwgfx: correct fb_fix_screeninfo.line_length", while fixing a
vmwgfx fbdev bug, also writes the pitch to a supposedly read-only register:
SVGA_REG_BYTES_PER_LINE, while it should be (and also in fact is) written to
SVGA_REG_PITCHLOCK.

This patch is Cc'd stable because of the unknown effects writing to this
register might have, particularly on older device versions.

v2: Updated log message.
