idr: fix idr_replace()'s returned error code

When the smaller id is not found, idr_replace() returns -ENOENT.  But
when the id is bigger enough, idr_replace() returns -EINVAL, actually
there is no difference between these two kinds of ids.

These are all unallocated id, the return values of the idr_replace() for
these ids should be the same: -ENOENT.
