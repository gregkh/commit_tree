ip_vti: Fix 'ip tunnel add' with 'key' parameters

ip tunnel add remote 10.2.2.1 local 10.2.2.2 mode vti ikey 1 okey 2
translates to p->iflags = VTI_ISVTI|GRE_KEY and p->i_key = 1, but GRE_KEY !=
TUNNEL_KEY, so ip_tunnel_ioctl would set i_key to 0 (same story with o_key)
making us unable to create vti tunnels with [io]key via ip tunnel.

We cannot simply translate GRE_KEY to TUNNEL_KEY (as GRE module does) because
vti_tunnels with same local/remote addresses but different ikeys will be treated
as different then. So, imo the best option here is to move p->i_flags & *_KEY
check for vti tunnels from ip_tunnel.c to ip_vti.c and to think about [io]_mark
field for ip_tunnel_parm in the future.
