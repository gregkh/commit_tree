workqueue: remove the confusing POOL_FREEZING

Currently, the global freezing state is propagated to worker_pools via
POOL_FREEZING and then to each workqueue; however, the middle step -
propagation through worker_pools - can be skipped as long as one or
more max_active adjustments happens for each workqueue after the
update to the global state is visible.  The global workqueue freezing
state and the max_active adjustments during workqueue creation and
[un]freezing are serialized with wq_pool_mutex, so it's trivial to
guarantee that max_actives stay in sync with global freezing state.

POOL_FREEZING is unnecessary and makes the code more confusing and
complicates freeze_workqueues_begin() and thaw_workqueues() by
requiring them to walk through all pools.

Remove POOL_FREEZING and use workqueue_freezing directly instead.
