PCI: Add support for PCIe-to-PCI bridge DMA alias quirks

Several PCIe-to-PCI bridges fail to provide a PCIe capability, causing us
to handle them as conventional PCI devices when they really use the
requester ID of the secondary bus.  We need to differentiate these from
PCIe-to-PCI bridges that actually use the conventional PCI ID when a PCIe
capability is not present, such as those found on the root complex of may
Intel chipsets.  Add a dev_flag bit to identify devices to be handled as
standard PCIe-to-PCI bridges.
