hwmon: (lm77) Do not preserve hysteresis when updating critical temp limit

Updating the hysteresis value when updating the critical temperature limit
was following the rule of 'least surprise'. However, it had the undesirable
side effect of changing the hysteresis for all other attributes, which
defeats the purpose of least surprise. In addition, it could result in
invalid hysteresis values if the resulting hysteresis was too large. In such
cases the resulting hysteresis ended up changed anyway, which again defeats
the purpose. So drop that code and document the new behavior.
