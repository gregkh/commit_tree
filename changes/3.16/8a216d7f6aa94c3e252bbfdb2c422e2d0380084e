ACPICA: Tables: Cleanup ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.

This patch refines ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.  No functional changes.

The previous commits have introduced the following internal APIs:
1. acpi_tb_acquire_table: Acquire struct acpi_table_header according to
                       ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.
2. acpi_tb_release_table: Release struct acpi_table_header according to
                       ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.
3. acpi_tb_install_table: Make struct acpi_table_desc.Address not NULL according to
                       ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.
4. acpi_tb_uninstall_table: Make struct acpi_table_desc.Address NULL according to
                         ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.
5. acpi_tb_validate_table: Make struct acpi_table_desc.Pointer not NULL according to
                        ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.
6. acpi_tb_invalidate_table: Make struct acpi_table_desc.Pointer NULL according to
                          ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxx flags.
It thus detects that the ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_UNKNOWN is redundant to
ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_OVERRIDE.

The ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_xxTERN_VIRTUAL flags are named as VIRTUAL in order
not to confuse with x86 logical address, this patch also renames all
"logical override" into "virtual override".
