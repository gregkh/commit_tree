drm/i915: Invalidate our pages under memory pressure

Try to flush out dirty pages into the swapcache (and from there into the
swapfile) when under memory pressure and forced to drop GEM objects from
memory. In effect, this should just allow us to discard unused pages for
memory reclaim and to start writeback earlier.

v2: Hugh Dickins warned that explicitly starting writeback from
shrink_slab was prone to deadlocks within shmemfs.
