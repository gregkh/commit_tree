gcov: add support for GCC 4.9

This patch handles the gcov-related changes in GCC 4.9:

  A new counter (time profile) is added. The total number is 9 now.

  A new profile merge function __gcov_merge_time_profile is added.

See gcc/gcov-io.h and libgcc/libgcov-merge.c

For the first change, the layout of struct gcov_info is affected.

For the second one, a dummy function is added to kernel/gcov/base.c
similarly.
