ACPI / video: Unregister the backlight device if a raw one shows up later

When video.use_native_backlight=1 and non intel gfx are in use, the raw
backlight device of the gfx driver will show up after acpi-video has done its
acpi_video_verify_backlight_support() check.

This causes video.use_native_backlight=1 to not have the desired result.

This patch fixes this by adding a backlight notifier and when a raw
backlight is registered or unregistered re-doing the
acpi_video_verify_backlight_support() check.
