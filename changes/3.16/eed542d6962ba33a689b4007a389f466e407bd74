ftrace: Make CALLER_ADDRx macros more generic

Most archs with HAVE_ARCH_CALLER_ADDR have pretty much the same
definitions of CALLER_ADDRx(n). Instead of duplicating the code for all
the archs, define a ftrace_return_address0() and
ftrace_return_address(n) that can be overwritten by the archs if they
need to do something different. Instead of 7 macros in every arch, we
now only have at most 2 (and actually only 1 as
ftrace_return_address0() should be the same for all archs).

The CALLER_ADDRx(n) will now be defined in linux/ftrace.h and use the
ftrace_return_address*(n?) macros. This removes a lot of the duplicate
code.
