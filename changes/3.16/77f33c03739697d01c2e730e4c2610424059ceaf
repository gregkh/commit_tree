rbd: move calls that may sleep out of spin lock range

get_user() and set_disk_ro() may allocate memory, leading to a
potential deadlock if theye are called while a spin lock is held.

Move the acquisition and release of rbd_dev->lock from rbd_ioctl()
into rbd_ioctl_set_ro(), so it can occur between get_user() and
set_disk_ro().
