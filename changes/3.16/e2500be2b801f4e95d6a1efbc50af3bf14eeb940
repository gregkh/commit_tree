powerpc/powernv: Remove OPAL v1 takeover

In commit 27f4488872d9 "Add OPAL takeover from PowerVM" we added support
for "takeover" on OPAL v1 machines.

This was a mode of operation where we would boot under pHyp, and query
for the presence of OPAL. If detected we would then do a special
sequence to take over the machine, and the kernel would end up running
in hypervisor mode.

OPAL v1 was never a supported product, and was never shipped outside
IBM. As far as we know no one is still using it.

Newer versions of OPAL do not use the takeover mechanism. Although the
query for OPAL should be harmless on machines with newer OPAL, we have
seen a machine where it causes a crash in Open Firmware.

The code in early_init_devtree() to copy boot_command_line into cmd_line
was added in commit 817c21ad9a1f "Get kernel command line accross OPAL
takeover", and AFAIK is only used by takeover, so should also be
removed.
