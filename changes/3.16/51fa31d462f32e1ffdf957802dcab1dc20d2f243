ALSA: bebob: Improve comments about stream format

Currently bebob driver apply Raw Audio Data channel (in IEC 61883-1:2002,
Multi Bit Linear Audio Data channel in IEC 61883-6:20005) to IEC 60958
Conformant Data channel because both fireworks and bebob based devices
can handle it by ignoring each label.

This patch improves a comment about this.
