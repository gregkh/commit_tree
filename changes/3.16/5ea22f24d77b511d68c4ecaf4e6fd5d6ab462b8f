drm: add extended property types

If we continue to use bitmask for type, we will quickly run out of room
to add new types.  Split this up so existing part of bitmask range
continues to function as before, but reserve a chunk of the remaining
space for an integer type-id.  Wrap this all up in some type-check
helpers to keep the backwards-compat uglyness contained.
