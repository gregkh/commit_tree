ARM: dts: AM4372: clk: efuse based crystal frequency detect

Currently oscillator frequency is determined based on sysboot settings,
it may not be the case always. To determine it properly, efuse settings
also has to be read. CONTROL_STATUS register holds this information.
Bit 31:	if 0, frequency to be determined based on sysboot
	if 1, frequency to be determined based on efuse
Bit 29,30 - for efuse detection of frequency
Bit 22,23 - for sysboot detection of frequency

Add clock nodes (mux) to determine oscillator frequency as above.
