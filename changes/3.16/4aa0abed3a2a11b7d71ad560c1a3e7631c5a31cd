staging: vt6655: Fix disassociated messages every 10 seconds

byReAssocCount is incremented every second resulting in
disassociated message being send every 10 seconds whether
connection or not.

byReAssocCount should only advance while eCommandState
is in WLAN_ASSOCIATE_WAIT

Change existing scope to if condition.
