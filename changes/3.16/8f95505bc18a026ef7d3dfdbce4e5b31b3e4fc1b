uprobes/x86: Emulate relative conditional "short" jmp's

Teach branch_emulate_op() to emulate the conditional "short" jmp's which
check regs->flags.

Note: this doesn't support jcxz/jcexz, loope/loopz, and loopne/loopnz.
They all are rel8 and thus they can't trigger the problem, but perhaps
we will add the support in future just for completeness.
