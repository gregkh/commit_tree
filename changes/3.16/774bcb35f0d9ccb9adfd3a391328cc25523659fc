btrfs: return ptr error from compression workspace

The btrfs compression wrappers translated errors from workspace
allocation to either -ENOMEM or -1.  The compression type workspace
allocators are already returning a ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).  Just return that
and get rid of the magical -1.

This helps a future patch return errors from the compression wrappers.
