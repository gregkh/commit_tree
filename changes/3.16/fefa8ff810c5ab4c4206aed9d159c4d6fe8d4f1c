cpufreq: unlock when failing cpufreq_update_policy()

Commit bd0fa9bb455d introduced a failure path to cpufreq_update_policy() if
cpufreq_driver->get(cpu) returns NULL.  However, it jumps to the 'no_policy'
label, which exits without unlocking any of the locks the function acquired
earlier.  This causes later calls into cpufreq to hang.

Fix this by creating a new 'unlock' label and jumping to that instead.
