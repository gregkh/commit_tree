dm: change sector_count member in clone_info from sector_t to unsigned

It is impossible to create bios with 2^23 or more sectors (the size is
stored as a 32-bit byte count in the bio). So we convert some sector_t
values to unsigned integers.

This is needed for the next commit ("dm: introduce
dm_accept_partial_bio") that replaces integer value arguments with
pointers, so the size of the integer must match.
