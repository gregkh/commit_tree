PM / sleep: trace events for suspend/resume

Adds trace events that give finer resolution into suspend/resume. These
events are graphed in the timelines generated by the analyze_suspend.py
script. They represent large areas of time consumed that are typical to
suspend and resume.

The event is triggered by calling the function "trace_suspend_resume"
with three arguments: a string (the name of the event to be displayed
in the timeline), an integer (case specific number, such as the power
state or cpu number), and a boolean (where true is used to denote the start
of the timeline event, and false to denote the end).

The suspend_resume trace event reproduces the data that the machine_suspend
trace event did, so the latter has been removed.
