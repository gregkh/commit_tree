 o Only define variables in the outermost block
 o One empty line at most
 o Format comments as per CodingStyle
 o Update FSF address in licensing term comment
 o Spell FPU and MIPS in all capitals.
 o Remove ####-type of lines in comments.
 o Try to make things a bit most consistent between sp_*.c / dp_*.c files.
