tcp: IPv6 support for fastopen server

After all the preparatory works, supporting IPv6 in Fast Open is now easy.
We pretty much just mirror v4 code. The only difference is how we
generate the Fast Open cookie for IPv6 sockets. Since Fast Open cookie
is 128 bits and we use AES 128, we use CBC-MAC to encrypt both the
source and destination IPv6 addresses since the cookie is a MAC tag.
