xhci: Add a global command queue

Create a list to store command structures, add a structure to it every time
a command is submitted, and remove it from the list once we get a
command completion event matching the command.

Callers that wait for completion will free their command structures themselves.
The other command structures are freed in the command completion event handler.

Also add a check that prevents queuing commands if host is dying
