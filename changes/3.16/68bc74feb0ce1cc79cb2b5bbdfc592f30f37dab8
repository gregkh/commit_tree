net: davinci_emac: fix oops caused by uninitialized ndev->dev

Commit e194312854edc22a2faf1931b3c0608fe20cb969 (drivers: net:
davinci_cpdma: Convert kzalloc() to devm_kzalloc()) triggered
a bug in emac_probe() wherein dev member of net_device is used
for devres allocations even before it is initialized.

This patch fixes that by using the struct device in platform_device
instead.

While at it, use &pdev->dev consistently for console messages instead
of using ndev->dev for just one case and remove an unnecessary line
continuation.
