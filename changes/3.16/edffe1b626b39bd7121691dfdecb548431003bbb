parport: fix menu breakage

Do not split the PARPORT-related symbols with the new kconfig
symbol ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_PARPORT. The split was causing incorrect
display of these symbols -- they were not being displayed together
as they should be.

Fixes: d90c3eb31535 "Kconfig cleanup (PARPORT_PC dependencies)"
