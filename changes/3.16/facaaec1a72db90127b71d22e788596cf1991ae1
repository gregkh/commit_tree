MIPS: KVM: Use local_flush_icache_range to fix RI on XBurst

MIPS KVM uses mips32_SyncICache to synchronise the icache with the
dcache after dynamically modifying guest instructions or writing guest
exception vector. However this uses rdhwr to get the SYNCI step, which
causes a reserved instruction exception on Ingenic XBurst cores.

It would seem to make more sense to use local_flush_icache_range()
instead which does the same thing but is more portable.
