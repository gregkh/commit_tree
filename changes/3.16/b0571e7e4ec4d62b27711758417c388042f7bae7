leds: leds-pwm: add DT support for LEDs wired to supply

The non-DT driver allowed an active low property to be specified, but DT
is missing this in its description.  Add the property to the DT binding
document, making it optional.  It defaults to active high, which retains
compatibility with existing descriptions.

This should only be used for causes where the LED is wired to supply,
and the PWM does not sensibly support its own inversion.
