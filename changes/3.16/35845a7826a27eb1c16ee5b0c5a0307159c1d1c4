powerpc/eeh: Can't recover from non-PE-reset case

When PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER returned from device drivers, the
EEH core should enable I/O and DMA for the affected PE. However,
it was missed to have DMA enabled in eeh_handle_normal_event().
Besides, the frozen state of the affected PE should be cleared
after successful recovery, but we didn't.

The patch fixes both of the issues as above.
