drm/i915: Use for_each_intel_crtc() when iterating through intel_crtcs

Generated using the semantic patch:

  @@
  iterator name list_for_each_entry;
  iterator name for_each_intel_crtc;
  struct intel_crtc * crtc;
  struct drm_device * dev;
  @@
  -list_for_each_entry(crtc,&dev->mode_config.crtc_list,...) {
  +for_each_intel_crtc(dev,crtc) {
	...
  }

Followed by a couple of fixups by hand (that spatch doesn't match the
cases where list_for_each_entry() is not followed by a set of '{', '}',
but I couldn't figure out a way to leave the '{' out of the iterator
match).
