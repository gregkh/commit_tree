ideapad_laptop: Introduce the use of the managed version of kzalloc

This patch moves data allocated using kzalloc to managed data allocated
using devm_kzalloc and cleans now unnecessary kfrees in probe and remove
functions. The label sysfs_failed is removed as it is no longer
required.  Also, linux/device.h is added to make sure the devm_*()
routine declarations are unambiguously available.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used for making the change:

@platform@
identifier p, probefn, removefn;
@@
struct platform_driver p = {
  .probe = probefn,
  .remove = removefn,
};

@prb@
identifier platform.probefn, pdev;
expression e, e1, e2;
@@
probefn(struct platform_device *pdev, ...) {
  <+...
- e = kzalloc(e1, e2)
+ e = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, e1, e2)
  ...
?-kfree(e);
  ...+>
}

@rem depends on prb@
identifier platform.removefn;
expression e;
@@
removefn(...) {
  <...
- kfree(e);
  ...>
}
