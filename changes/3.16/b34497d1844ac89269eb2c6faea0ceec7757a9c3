powerpc/powernv: Remove fields in PHB diag-data dump

For some fields (e.g. LEM, MMIO, DMA) in PHB diag-data dump, it's
meaningless to print them if they have non-zero value in the
corresponding mask registers because we always have non-zero values
in the mask registers. The patch only prints those fieds if we
have non-zero values in the primary registers (e.g. LEM, MMIO, DMA
status) so that we can save couple of lines. The patch also removes
unnecessary spare line before "brdgCtl:" and two leading spaces as
prefix in each line as Ben suggested.
