appletalk: Fix socket referencing in skb

Setting just skb->sk without taking its reference and setting a
destructor is invalid. However, in the places where this was done, skb
is used in a way not requiring skb->sk setting. So dropping the setting
of skb->sk.
Thanks to Eric Dumazet <eric.dumazet@gmail.com> for correct solution.
