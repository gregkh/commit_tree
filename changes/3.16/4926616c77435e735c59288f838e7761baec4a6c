powerpc/powernv: Add calls to support little endian host

When running as a powernv "host" system on P8, we need to switch
the endianness of interrupt handlers. This does it via the appropriate
call to the OPAL firmware which may result in just switching HID0:HILE
but depending on the processor version might need to do a few more
things. This call must be done early before any other processor has
been brought out of firmware.
