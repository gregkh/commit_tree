block: virtio_blk: don't hold spin lock during world switch

Firstly, it isn't necessary to hold lock of vblk->vq_lock
when notifying hypervisor about queued I/O.

Secondly, virtqueue_notify() will cause world switch and
it may take long time on some hypervisors(such as, qemu-arm),
so it isn't good to hold the lock and block other vCPUs.

On arm64 quad core VM(qemu-kvm), the patch can increase I/O
performance a lot with VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX enabled:
	- without the patch: 14K IOPS
	- with the patch: 34K IOPS

fio script:
	[global]
	direct=1
	bsrange=4k-4k
	timeout=10
	numjobs=4
	ioengine=libaio
	iodepth=64

	filename=/dev/vdc
	group_reporting=1
