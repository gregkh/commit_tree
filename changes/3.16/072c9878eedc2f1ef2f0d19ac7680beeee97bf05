KVM: s390: add kvm_s390_logical_to_effective() helper

Add kvm_s390_logical_to_effective() helper which converts a guest vcpu's
logical storage address to a guest vcpu effective address by applying the
rules of the vcpu's addressing mode defined by PSW bits 31 and 32
(extendended and basic addressing mode).
Depending on the vcpu's addressing mode the upper 40 bits (24 bit addressing
mode), 33 bits (31 bit addressing mode) or no bits (64 bit addressing mode)
will be zeroed and the remaining bits will be returned.
