netlink: have netlink per-protocol bind function return an error code.

Have the netlink per-protocol optional bind function return an int error code
rather than void to signal a failure.

This will enable netlink protocols to perform extra checks including
capabilities and permissions verifications when updating memberships in
multicast groups.

In netlink_bind() and netlink_setsockopt() the call to the per-protocol bind
function was moved above the multicast group update to prevent any access to
the multicast socket groups before checking with the per-protocol bind
function.  This will enable the per-protocol bind function to be used to check
permissions which could be denied before making them available, and to avoid
the messy job of undoing the addition should the per-protocol bind function
fail.

The netfilter subsystem seems to be the only one currently using the
per-protocol bind function.
