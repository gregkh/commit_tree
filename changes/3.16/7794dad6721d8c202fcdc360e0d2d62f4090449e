staging: vt6656: BBvUpdatePreEDThreshold reorganize ControlvWriteByte.

Create variables cr_201 and cr 206 with values for registers 0xc9 and 0xce.

Set both to zero .

If cr201 and cr206 are zero drop out.

write both out with ControlvWriteByte.

pDevice->byBBPreEDIndex breaks will be dealt with in next patch
