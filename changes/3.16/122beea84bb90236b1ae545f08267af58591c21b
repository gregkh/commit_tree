drm/exynos: allocate non-contigous buffers when iommu is enabled

Allow to allocate non-contigous buffers when iommu is enabled.
Currently, it tries to allocates contigous buffer which consistently
fail for large buffers and then fall back to non contigous. Apart
from being slow, this implementation is also very noisy and fills
the screen with alloc fail logs.
