unicore32: Remove ARCH_HAS_CPUFREQ config option

This config exists entirely to hide the cpufreq menu from the
kernel configuration unless a platform has selected it. Nothing
is actually built if this config is 'Y' and it just leads to more
patches that add a select under a platform Kconfig so that some
other CPUfreq option can be chosen. Let's remove the option so
that we can always enable CPUfreq drivers on unicore32 platforms.
