cpufreq: kirkwood: Reinstate cpufreq driver for ARCH_KIRKWOOD

Commit ff1f0018cf66080d8e6f59791e552615648a033a ("drivers: Enable
building of Kirkwood drivers for mach-mvebu") added Kirkwood into
mach-mvebu, adding MACH_KIRKWOOD to ARCH_KIRKWOOD in the KConfig files.

The change for ARM_KIRKWOOD_CPUFREQ replaced ARCH_KIRKWOOD with
MACH_KIRKWOOD, whereas all the other changes were ARCH_KIRKWOOD ||
MACH_KIRKWOOD.

As a consequence of this change, the cpufreq driver is no longer enabled
for ARCH_KIRKWOOD. This patch reinstates ARM_KIRKWOOD_CPUFREQ for
ARCH_KIRKWOOD.
