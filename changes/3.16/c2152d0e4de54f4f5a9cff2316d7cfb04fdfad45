clk: bcm/kona: implement determine_rate()

Implement the clk->determine_rate method for Broadcom Kona peripheral
clocks.  This allows a peripheral clock to be re-parented in order to
satisfy a rate change request.  This takes the place of the previous
kona_peri_clk_round_rate() functionality, though that function remains
because it is used by the new one.

The parent clock that allows the peripheral clock to produce a rate
closest to the one requested is the one selected, though the current
parent is used by default.
