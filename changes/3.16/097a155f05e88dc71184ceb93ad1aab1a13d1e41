usb: synchronize port poweroff and khubd

If a port is powered-off, or in the process of being powered-off, prevent
khubd from operating on it.  Otherwise, the following sequence of events
leading to an unintended disconnect may occur:

Events:
(0) <set pm_qos_no_poweroff to '0' for port1>
(1) hub 2-2:1.0: hub_resume
(2) hub 2-2:1.0: port 1: status 0301 change 0000
(3) hub 2-2:1.0: state 7 ports 4 chg 0002 evt 0000
(4) hub 2-2:1.0: port 1, power off status 0000, change 0000, 12 Mb/s
(5) usb 2-2.1: USB disconnect, device number 5

Description:
(1) hub is resumed before sending a ClearPortFeature request
(2) hub_activate() notices the port is connected and sets
    hub->change_bits for the port
(3) hub_events() starts, but at the same time the port suspends
(4) hub_connect_change() sees the disabled port and triggers disconnect
