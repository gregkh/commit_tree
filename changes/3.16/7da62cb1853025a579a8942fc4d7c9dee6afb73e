i2c: nuc900: remove driver

Arnd said in another patch:

"As far as I can tell, this driver must have produced this
error for as long as it has been merged into the mainline kernel, but
it was never part of the normal build tests:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nuc900.c: In function 'nuc900_i2c_probe':
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nuc900.c:601:17: error: request for member
'apbfreq' in something not a structure or union
  ret = (i2c->clk.apbfreq)/(pdata->bus_freq * 5) - 1;
                 ^
This is an attempt to get the driver to build and possibly
work correctly, although I do wonder whether we should just
remove it, as it has clearly never worked."

I agree with removing it since nobody showed interest in Arnd's fixup
patch.
