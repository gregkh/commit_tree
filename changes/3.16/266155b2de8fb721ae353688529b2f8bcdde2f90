netfilter: ctnetlink: fix dumping of dying/unconfirmed conntracks

The dumping prematurely stops, it seems the callback argument that
indicates that all entries have been dumped is set after iterating
on the first cpu list. The dumping also may stop before the entire
per-cpu list content is also dumped.

With this patch, conntrack -L dying now shows the dying list content
again.
