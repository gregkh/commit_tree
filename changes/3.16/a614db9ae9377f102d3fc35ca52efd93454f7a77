powerpc/fsl-rio: Fix fsl_rio_setup error paths and use-after-unmap

Several of the error paths from fsl_rio_setup are missing error
messages.

Worse, fsl_rio_setup initializes several global pointers and does not
NULL them out after freeing/unmapping on error.  This caused
fsl_rio_mcheck_exception() to crash when accessing rio_regs_win which
was non-NULL but had been unmapped.

Liu Gang, are you sure all of these error conditions are fatal?  Why
does the rio driver fail if rmu is not present (e.g.  on t4240)?
