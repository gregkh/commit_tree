perf tools: Account entry stats when it's added to the output tree

Currently, accounting each sample is done in multiple places - once
when adding them to the input tree, other when adding them to the
output tree.  It's not only confusing but also can cause a subtle
problem since concurrent processing like in perf top might see the
updated stats before adding entries into the output tree - like seeing
more (blank) lines at the end and/or slight inaccurate percentage.

To fix this, only account the entries when it's moved into the output
tree so that they cannot be seen prematurely.  There're some
exceptional cases here and there - they should be addressed separately
with comments.
