ARM: dts: kirkwood: add kirkwood-km_common DTSI files

This file allows to factor the common parts between the various Keymile
Kirkwood Designs.

kirkwood-km_common configures the peripherals that are currently
common to all our Kirkwood designs: PCIe, pinctrl, bitbang I2C, NAND
Flash controller.

The kirkwood-km_kirkwood file is then changed to include this common
file.
