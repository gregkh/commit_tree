drm/i915/chv: Implement stolen memory size detection

CHV uses the same bits as SNB/VLV to code the Graphics Mode Select field
(GFX stolen memory size) with the addition of finer granularity modes:
4MB increments from 0x11 (8MB) to 0x1d.

Values strictly above 0x1d are either reserved or not supported.

v2: 4MB increments, not 8MB. 32MB has been omitted from the list of new
    values (Ville Syrjälä)

v3: Also correctly interpret GGMS (GTT Graphics Memory Size) (Ville
    Syrjälä)

v4: Don't assign a value that needs 20bits or more to a u16 (Rafael
    Barbalho)
