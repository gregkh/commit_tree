perf: Fix perf_event_open(.flags) test

Vince noticed that we test the (unsigned long) flags field against an
(unsigned int) constant. This would allow setting the high bits on 64bit
platforms and not get an error.

There is nothing that uses the high bits, so it should be entirely
harmless, but we don't want userspace to accidentally set them anyway,
so fix the constants.
