tipc: fix memory leak of publications

Commit 1bb8dce57f4d15233688c68990852a10eb1cd79f ("tipc: fix memory
leak during module removal") introduced a memory leak issue: when
name table is stopped, it's forgotten that publication instances are
freed properly. Additionally the useless "continue" statement in
tipc_nametbl_stop() is removed as well.
