ARM: dts: kirkwood: set default pinctrl for UART0/1

Most boards use the default UART0/1 pinctrl setting without RTS/CTS.
Add the pinctrl setting to the toplevel SoC UART nodes and put a note
in front of the corresponding pinctrl node to overwrite the setting
on board level. Currently, both boards using a different UART pinctrl
setting (Openblocks A6, A7) already overwrite the pinctrl node.

While at it, also fix up some status = "ok" to "okay" and again
whitespace issues on mplcec4 uart nodes.
