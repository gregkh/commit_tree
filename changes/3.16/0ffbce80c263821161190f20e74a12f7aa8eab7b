blk-mq: blk_mq_start_hw_queue() should use blk_mq_run_hw_queue()

Currently it calls __blk_mq_run_hw_queue(), which depends on the
CPU placement being correct. This means it's not possible to call
blk_mq_start_hw_queues(q) from a context that is correct for all
queues, leading to triggering the

WARN_ON(!cpumask_test_cpu(raw_smp_processor_id(), hctx->cpumask));

in __blk_mq_run_hw_queue().
