hwmon: (ina2xx) Cast to s16 on shunt and current regs

All devices supported by ina2xx are bidirectional and report the
measured shunt voltage and power values as a signed 16 bit, but the
current driver implementation caches all registers as u16, leading
to an incorrect sign extension when reporting to userspace in
ina2xx_get_value().

This patch fixes the problem by casting the signed registers to s16.
Tested on an INA219.
