USB: ftdi_sio: fix null deref at port probe

Fix NULL-pointer dereference when probing an interface with no
endpoints.

These devices have two bulk endpoints per interface, but this avoids
crashing the kernel if a user forces a non-FTDI device to be probed.

Note that the iterator variable was made unsigned in order to avoid
a maybe-uninitialized compiler warning for ep_desc after the loop.

calculation")
