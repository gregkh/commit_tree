dmaengine: sh: don't use dynamic static allocation

dynamic stack allocation in kernel is considered bad as kernel stack is low and
we get warns on few archs as reported by kbuild test robot

>> drivers/dma/sh/shdma-base.c:671:32: sparse: Variable length array is used.
>> drivers/dma/sh/shdma-base.c:701:1: warning: 'shdma_prep_dma_cyclic' uses
>> dynamic stack allocation [enabled by default]

Fix this by making a static array of 32 which should be sufficient for
shdma_prep_dma_cyclic which only user in kernel is audio and 32 periods for
audio seems quite sufficient atm
