Btrfs: fix race of using total_bytes_pinned

This percpu counter @total_bytes_pinned is introduced to skip unnecessary
operations of 'commit transaction', it accounts for those space we may free
but are stuck in delayed refs.

And we zero out @space_info->total_bytes_pinned every transaction period so
we have a better idea of how much space we'll actually free up by committing
this transaction.  However, we do the 'zero out' part a little earlier, before
we actually unpin space, so we end up returning ENOSPC when we actually have
free space that's just unpinned from committing transaction.

xfstests/generic/074 complained then.

This fixes it by actually accounting the percpu pinned number when 'unpin',
and since it's protected by space_info->lock, the race is gone now.
