ASoC: Intel: Make Baytrail PCM data per stream rather than per DAI device

Prepare for single Baytrail DAI playback/capture link by accessing PCM data
using stream ID instead of rtd->dev. Now rtd->dev is unique for playback
and capture since they are exported as separate DAIs but not once converted
to single DAI.
