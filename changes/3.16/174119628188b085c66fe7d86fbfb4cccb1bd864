mm/mempool.c: update the kmemleak stack trace for mempool allocations

When mempool_alloc() returns an existing pool object, kmemleak_alloc()
is no longer called and the stack trace corresponds to the original
object allocation.  This patch updates the kmemleak allocation stack
trace for such objects to make it more useful for debugging.
