usb: don't clear FEAT_C_ENABLE on usb_port_runtime_resume failure

Three reasons:
1/ It's an invalid operation on usb3 ports
2/ There's no guarantee of when / if a usb2 port has entered an error
   state relative to PORT_POWER request
3/ The port is active / powered at this point, so khubd will clear it as
   a matter of course
