drm/plane_helper: don't disable plane in destroy function

By the time drm_mode_config_cleanup calls this all the hw state should
be cleaned up already - we even have a WARN right before calling
plane->destroy callbacks asserting that all framebuffers are gone.

So trying to disable things harder is a bit a bug. Caught by Thierry
since it resulted in some mode_config.mutex locking backtraces.
