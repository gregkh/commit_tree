irqchip: gic: Add support for cortex a7 compatible string

Patch 0a68214b "ARM: DT: Add binding for GIC virtualization extentions (VGIC)" added
the "arm,cortex-a7-gic" compatible string, but the corresponding IRQCHIP_DECLARE
was never added to the gic driver.

To let real Cortex-A7 SoCs use it, add the necessary declaration to the device driver.
