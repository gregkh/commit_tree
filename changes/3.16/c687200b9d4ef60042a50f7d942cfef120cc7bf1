ALSA: hda - drop def association and sequence from pinconf comparing

A lot a machine have the same codec, but they have different default
pinconf setting just because the def association and sequence is
different, as a result they can't share a hda_pintbl[], to overcome
it, we don't compare def association and sequence in the pinconf
matching.
