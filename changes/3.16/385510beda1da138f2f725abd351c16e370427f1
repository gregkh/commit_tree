powerpc/fsl: Added binding for Freescale CoreNet coherency fabric (CCF)

The CoreNet coherency fabric is a fabric-oriented, conectivity
infrastructure that enables the implementation of coherent, multicore
systems. The CCF acts as a central interconnect for cores,
platform-level caches, memory subsystem, peripheral devices and I/O host
bridges in the system.
