cgroup: move cgroup->kn->priv clearing to cgroup_rmdir()

The ->priv field of a cgroup directory kernfs_node points back to the
cgroup.  This field is RCU cleared in cgroup_destroy_locked() for
non-kernfs accesses from css_tryget_from_dir() and
cgroupstats_build().

As these are only applicable to cgroups which finished creation
successfully and fully initialized cgroups are always removed by
cgroup_rmdir(), this can be safely moved to the end of cgroup_rmdir().

This will help simplifying cgroup locking and shouldn't introduce any
behavior difference.
