s390/spinlock: cleanup spinlock code

Improve the spinlock code in several aspects:
 - Have _raw_compare_and_swap return true if the operation has been
   successful instead of returning the old value.
 - Remove the "volatile" from arch_spinlock_t and arch_rwlock_t
 - Rename 'owner_cpu' to 'lock'
 - Add helper functions arch_spin_trylock_once / arch_spin_tryrelease_once
