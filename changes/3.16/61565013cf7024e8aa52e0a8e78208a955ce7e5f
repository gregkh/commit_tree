IB/mlx4: SET_PORT called by mlx4_ib_modify_port should be wrapped

mlx4_ib_modify_port is invoked in IB for resetting the Q_Key violations
counters and for modifying the IB port capability flags.

For example, when opensm is started up on the hypervisor,
mlx4_ib_modify_port is called to set the port's IsSM flag.

In multifunction mode, the SET_PORT command used in this flow should
be wrapped (so that the PF port capability flags are also tracked,
thus enabling the aggregate of all the VF/PF capability flags to be
tracked properly).

The procedure mlx4_SET_PORT() in main.c is also renamed to mlx4_ib_SET_PORT()
to differentiate it from procedure mlx4_SET_PORT() in port.c.
mlx4_ib_SET_PORT() is used exclusively by mlx4_ib_modify_port().

Finally, the CM invokes ib_modify_port() to set the IsCMSupported flag
even when running over RoCE.  Therefore, when RoCE is active,
mlx4_ib_modify_port should return OK unconditionally (since the
capability flags and qkey violations counter are not relevant).
