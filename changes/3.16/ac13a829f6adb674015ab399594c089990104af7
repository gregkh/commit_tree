fs/libfs.c: add generic data flush to fsync

Description by Jan Kara:
 "A lot of older filesystems don't properly flush volatile disk caches
  on fsync(2) which can lead to loss of fsynced data after power failure.

This patch makes generic_file_fsync() issue proper cache flush to fix the
problem.  Sysadmin can use /sys/devices/.../cache_type to tell the system
it should not send the cache flush."
