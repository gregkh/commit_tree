scsi/NCR5380: fix build failures when debugging is enabled

The change from cmd->target to cmd->device->id was apparently the purpose of
commit a7f251228390e87d86c5e3846f99a455517fdd8e in
kernel/git/tglx/history.git but some instances have been missed.

Also fix the "NDEBUG_LAST_WRITE_SENT" and "NDEBUG_ALL" typo's.

Also fix some format strings (%ul becomes %lu) that caused compiler warnings.
