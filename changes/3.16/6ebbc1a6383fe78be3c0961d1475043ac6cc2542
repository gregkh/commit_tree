virtio-net: Set needed_headroom for virtio-net when VIRTIO_F_ANY_LAYOUT is true

This is a small supplement for commit e7428e95a06fb516fac1308bd0e176e27c0b9287
("virtio-net: put virtio-net header inline with data"). TCP packages have
enough room to put virtio-net header in, but UDP packages do not. By
setting dev->needed_headroom for virtio-net device, UDP packages could have
enough room.

For UDP packages, sk_buff is alloced in fun __ip_append_data. The size is
"alloclen + hh_len + 15", and "hh_len = LL_RESERVED_SPACE(rt-dst.dev);".
The Macro is defined as follows:
#define LL_RESERVED_SPACE(dev) \
     ((((dev)->hard_header_len+(dev)->needed_headroom)\
     &~(HH_DATA_MOD - 1)) + HH_DATA_MOD)
By default, for UDP packages, after skb is allocated, only 16 bytes
reserved. And 2 bytes remained after mac header is set. That is not enough
to put virtio-net header in. If we set dev->needed_headroom to 12 or 10
(according to mergeable_rx_bufs is on or off ), more room can be reserved.
Then there is enough room for UDP packages to put the header in.
