NFS: populate ->net in mount data when remounting

Otherwise the kernel oopses when remounting with IPv6 server because
net is dereferenced in dev_get_by_name.

Use net ns of current thread so that dev_get_by_name does not operate on
foreign ns. Changing the address is prohibited anyway so this should not
affect anything.
