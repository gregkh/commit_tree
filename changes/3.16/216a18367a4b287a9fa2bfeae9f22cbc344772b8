ath10k: skip suspending when recovering

It doesn't make much sense to even try suspending
the device when recovering. Recovering means the
device is unresponsive and waiting for suspend
procedure means taking a 3 second timeout waiting
for tx credits.

This speeds up firmware recovery significantly.
