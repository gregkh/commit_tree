target: Report correct response length for some commands

When an initiator sends an allocation length bigger than what its
command consumes, the target should only return the actual response data
and set the residual length to the unused part of the allocation length.

Add a helper function that command handlers (INQUIRY, READ CAPACITY,
etc) can use to do this correctly, and use this code to get the correct
residual for commands that don't use the full initiator allocation in the
handlers for READ CAPACITY, READ CAPACITY(16), INQUIRY, MODE SENSE and
REPORT LUNS.

This addresses a handful of failures as reported by Christophe with
the Windows Certification Kit:
