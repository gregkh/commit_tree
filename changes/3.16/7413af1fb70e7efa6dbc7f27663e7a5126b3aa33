ftrace: Make get_ftrace_addr() and get_ftrace_addr_old() global

Move and rename get_ftrace_addr() and get_ftrace_addr_old() to
ftrace_get_addr_new() and ftrace_get_addr_curr() respectively.

This moves these two helper functions in the generic code out from
the arch specific code, and renames them to have a better generic
name. This will allow other archs to use them as well as makes it
a bit easier to work on getting separate trampolines for different
functions.

ftrace_get_addr_new() returns the trampoline address that the mcount
call address will be converted to.

ftrace_get_addr_curr() returns the trampoline address of what the
mcount call address currently jumps to.
