ARM: kprobes: Prevent known test failures stopping other tests running

Due to a long-standing issue with Thumb symbol lookup [1] the jprobes
tests fail when built into a kernel compiled as Thumb mode. (They work
fine for ARM mode kernels or for Thumb when built as a loadable module.)

Rather than have this problem terminate testing prematurely lets instead
emit an error message and carry on with the main kprobes tests, delaying
the final failure report until the end.
