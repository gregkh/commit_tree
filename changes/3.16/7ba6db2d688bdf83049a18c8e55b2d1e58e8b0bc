uprobes/x86: Emulate unconditional relative jmp's

Currently we always execute all insns out-of-line, including relative
jmp's and call's. This assumes that even if regs->ip points to nowhere
after the single-step, default_post_xol_op(UPROBE_FIX_IP) logic will
update it correctly.

However, this doesn't work if this regs->ip == xol_vaddr + insn_offset
is not canonical. In this case CPU generates #GP and general_protection()
kills the task which tries to execute this insn out-of-line.

Now that we have uprobe_xol_ops we can teach uprobes to emulate these
insns and solve the problem. This patch adds branch_xol_ops which has
a single branch_emulate_op() hook, so far it can only handle rel8/32
relative jmp's.

TODO: move ->fixup into the union along with rip_rela_target_address.
