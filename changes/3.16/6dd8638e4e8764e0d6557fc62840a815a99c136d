xfs: use and update the finobt on inode allocation

Replace xfs_dialloc_ag() with an implementation that looks for a
record in the finobt. The finobt only tracks records with at least
one free inode. This eliminates the need for the intra-ag scan in
the original algorithm. Once the inode is allocated, update the
finobt appropriately (possibly removing the record) as well as the
inobt.

Move the original xfs_dialloc_ag() algorithm to
xfs_dialloc_ag_inobt() and fall back as such if finobt support is
not enabled.
