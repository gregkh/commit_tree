ext4: revert commit which was causing fs corruption after journal replays

Commit 007649375f6af2 ("ext4: initialize multi-block allocator before
checking block descriptors") causes the block group descriptor's count
of the number of free blocks to become inconsistent with the number of
free blocks in the allocation bitmap.  This is a harmless form of fs
corruption, but it causes the kernel to potentially remount the file
system read-only, or to panic, depending on the file systems's error
behavior.

Thanks to Eric Whitney for his tireless work to reproduce and to find
the guilty commit.
