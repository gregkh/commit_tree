ACPI / battery: add quirk for Acer Aspire V5-573G

On Acer Aspire V5-573G battery notifications are sometimes
triggered too early. For example, when AC is unplugged and
notification is triggered, battery state is still reported as
"Full", and changes to "Discharging" only after short delay,
without any notification.

This patch solves the problem by adding 1 second sleep.
Similar quirk is already implemented in AC driver for other laptop.
