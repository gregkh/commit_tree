DMA: Freescale: unify register access methods

Methods of accessing DMA controller registers are inconsistent, some registers
are accessed by DMA_IN/OUT directly, while others are accessed by functions
get/set_* which are wrappers of DMA_IN/OUT, and even for the BCR register, it
is read by get_bcr but written by DMA_OUT.
This patch unifies the inconsistent methods, all registers are accessed by
get/set_* now.
