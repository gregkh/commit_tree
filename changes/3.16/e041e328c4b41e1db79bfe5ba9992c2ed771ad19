perf: Fix perf_event_comm() vs. exec() assumption

perf_event_comm() assumes that set_task_comm() is only called on
exec(), and in particular that its only called on current.

Neither are true, as Dave reported a WARN triggered by set_task_comm()
being called on !current.

Separate the exec() hook from the comm hook.
