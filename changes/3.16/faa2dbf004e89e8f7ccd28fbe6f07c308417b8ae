Btrfs: add sanity tests for new qgroup accounting code

This exercises the various parts of the new qgroup accounting code.  We do some
basic stuff and do some things with the shared refs to make sure all that code
works.  I had to add a bunch of infrastructure because I needed to be able to
insert items into a fake tree without having to do all the hard work myself,
hopefully this will be usefull in the future.  Thanks,
