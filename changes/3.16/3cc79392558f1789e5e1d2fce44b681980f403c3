Btrfs: atomically set inode->i_flags in btrfs_update_iflags

This change is based on the corresponding recent change for ext4:

  ext4: atomically set inode->i_flags in ext4_set_inode_flags()

That has the following commit message that applies to btrfs as well:

  "Use cmpxchg() to atomically set i_flags instead of clearing out the
   S_IMMUTABLE, S_APPEND, etc. flags and then setting them from the
   EXT4_IMMUTABLE_FL, EXT4_APPEND_FL flags, since this opens up a race
   where an immutable file has the immutable flag cleared for a brief
   window of time."

Replacing EXT4_IMMUTABLE_FL and EXT4_APPEND_FL with BTRFS_INODE_IMMUTABLE
and BTRFS_INODE_APPEND, respectively.
