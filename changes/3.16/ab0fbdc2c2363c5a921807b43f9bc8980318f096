staging: rtl8192u: cleanup a switch statement

The white space was all wrong here.  The case statements were indented
too far.  The if else blocks weren't indented at all.  There was a break
statement aligned with the else block and it confused my static checker
because "were curly braces intended" so that the break statement was
only on the else side?  Also I removed some commented out code.
