x86, boot: Remove misc.h inclusion from compressed/string.c

Given the fact that we removed inclusion of boot.h from boot/string.c
does not look like we need misc.h inclusion in compressed/string.c. So
remove it.

misc.h was also pulling in string_32.h which in turn had macros for
memcmp and memcpy. So we don't need to #undef memcmp and memcpy anymore.
