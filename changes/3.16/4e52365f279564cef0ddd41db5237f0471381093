ptrace: fix fork event messages across pid namespaces

When tracing a process in another pid namespace, it's important for fork
event messages to contain the child's pid as seen from the tracer's pid
namespace, not the parent's.  Otherwise, the tracer won't be able to
correlate the fork event with later SIGTRAP signals it receives from the
child.

We still risk a race condition if a ptracer from a different pid
namespace attaches after we compute the pid_t value.  However, sending a
bogus fork event message in this unlikely scenario is still a vast
improvement over the status quo where we always send bogus fork event
messages to debuggers in a different pid namespace than the forking
process.
