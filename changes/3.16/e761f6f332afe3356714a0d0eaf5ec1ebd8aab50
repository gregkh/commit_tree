ARM: l2c: highbank: remove explicit SMI call in L2 cache initialisation

Now that highbank uses the write_sec method, we don't need to enable
the L2 cache in SoC specific code; this can be done via the normal
mechanisms in the L2C code.

Checking with Rob Herring:

So also drop the DT check too.  I'm leaving the config check in place
so that if L2 is disabled, the write_sec hook can be optimised away.
