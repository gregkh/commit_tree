KVM: s390: introduce kvm_s390_vcpu_{start,stop}

This patch introduces two new functions to set/clear the CPUSTAT_STOPPED bit and
makes use of it at all applicable places. These functions prepare the additional
execution of code when starting/stopping a vcpu.

The CPUSTAT_STOPPED bit should not be touched outside of these functions.
