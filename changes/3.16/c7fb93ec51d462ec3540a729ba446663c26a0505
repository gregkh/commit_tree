x86/efi: Include a .bss section within the PE/COFF headers

The PE/COFF headers currently describe only the initialised-data
portions of the image, and result in no space being allocated for the
uninitialised-data portions.  Consequently, the EFI boot stub will end
up overwriting unexpected areas of memory, with unpredictable results.

Fix by including a .bss section in the PE/COFF headers (functionally
equivalent to the init_size field in the bzImage header).
