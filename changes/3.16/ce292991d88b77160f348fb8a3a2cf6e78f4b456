PCI: generic: Add generic PCI host controller driver

Add support for a generic PCI host controller, such as a
firmware-initialised device with static windows or an emulation by
something such as kvmtool.

The controller itself has no configuration registers and has its address
spaces described entirely by the device-tree (using the bindings from
ePAPR).  Both CAM and ECAM are supported for Config Space accesses.

Add corresponding documentation for the DT binding.
