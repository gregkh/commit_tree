drm: Check CRTC compatibility in setplane

The DRM core setplane code should check that the plane is usable on the
specified CRTC before calling into the driver.

Prior to this patch, a plane's possible_crtcs field was purely
informational for userspace and was never actually verified at the
kernel level (aside from the primary plane helper).
