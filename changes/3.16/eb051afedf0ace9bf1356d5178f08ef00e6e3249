i40e: Allow RSS table entry range and GPS to be any number, not necessarily power of 2

We tell the HW upper boundary of power of 2 in VSI config,
but the HW does not restrict us to use just power of 2 GPS in
case of RSS as long as we are not sharing the RSS table with
another VSI (VMDq). We at present are not doing RSS in VMDq
VSI.
If we were to enable that and if the system had CPU count which
was not power 2, the VMDq VSIs will see a little skewed distribution.
