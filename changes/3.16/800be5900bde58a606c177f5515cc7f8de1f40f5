ASoC: Intel: Move Baytrail extended fw address saving to sst_byt_boot()

We have to save the physical address of extended firmware block in the
beginning of mailbox every time when we boot the DSP firmware since that
mailbox address is re-used after DSP firmware is running. Otherwise DSP
firmware will get bogus extended firmware block address during next DSP
boot.

Currently this is not problem but becomes when DSP runtime rebooting is
implemented. Prepare for that by moving extended firmware address saving
from sst_byt_init() to sst_byt_boot().
