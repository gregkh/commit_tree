ARM: dts: kirkwood: set default pinctrl for I2C1 on 6282

Currently, the only 6282-based Kirkwood boards that use I2C1 are Openblocks
A6/A7. Both use the same default I2C1 pinctrl setting from kirkwood-6282.dtsi.
Move the pinctrl setting to the I2C1 node directly and put a note in front of
the corresponding pinctrl node to overwrite the setting on board level.
