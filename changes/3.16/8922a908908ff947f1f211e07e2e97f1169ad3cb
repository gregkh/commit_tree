scsi_error: fix invalid setting of host byte

After scsi_try_to_abort_cmd returns, the eh_abort_handler may have
already found that the command has completed in the device, causing
the host_byte to be nonzero (e.g. it could be DID_ABORT).  When
this happens, ORing DID_TIME_OUT into the host byte will corrupt
the result field and initiate an unwanted command retry.

Fix this by using set_host_byte instead, following the model of
commit 2082ebc45af9c9c648383b8cde0dc1948eadbf31.
