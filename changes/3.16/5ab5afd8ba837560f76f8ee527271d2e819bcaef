ARM: mvebu: implement Armada 375 coherency workaround

The early revisions of Armada 375 SOCs (Z1 stepping) have a bug in the
I/O coherency unit that prevents using the normal method for the I/O
coherency barrier. The recommended workaround is to use a XOR memset
transfer to act as the I/O coherency barrier.

This involves "borrowing" a XOR engine, which gets disabled in the
Device Tree so the normal XOR driver doesn't use it.
