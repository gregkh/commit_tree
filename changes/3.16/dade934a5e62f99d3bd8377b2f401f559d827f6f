powerpc: Remove non-uapi linkage.h export

The arch/powerpc/include/asm/linkage.h is being unintentionally exported
in the kernel headers since commit e1b5bb6d1236 (consolidate
cond_syscall and SYSCALL_ALIAS declarations) when
arch/powerpc/include/uapi/asm/linkage.h was deleted but the header-y not
removed from the Kbuild file. This happens because Makefile.headersinst
still checks the old asm/ directory if the specified header doesn't
exist in the uapi directory.

The asm/linkage.h shouldn't ever have been exported anyway. No other
arch does and it doesn't contain anything useful to userland, so remove
the header-y line from the Kbuild file which triggers the export.
