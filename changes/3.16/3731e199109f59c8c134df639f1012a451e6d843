sparc32: fix sparse warnings in leon_pci_grpci2.c

Fix following warnings:
leon_pci_grpci2.c:218:1: warning: symbol 'grpci2_dev_lock' was not declared. Should it be static?
leon_pci_grpci2.c:219:20: warning: symbol 'grpci2priv' was not declared. Should it be static?
leon_pci_grpci2.c:221:5: warning: symbol 'grpci2_map_irq' was not declared. Should it be static?
leon_pci_grpci2.c:564:6: warning: symbol 'grpci2_hw_init' was not declared. Should it be
static?

+ a lot of these:
leon_pci_grpci2.c:252:9: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)

Declare the symbols static as they are only used in this file.
Added missing __iomem annotations.
