tipc: use RCU to protect media_ptr pointer

Now the media_ptr pointer is protected with tipc_net_lock write lock
on write side; tipc_net_lock read lock is used to read side. As the
part of effort of eliminating tipc_net_lock, we decide to adjust the
locking policy of media_ptr pointer protection: on write side, RTNL
lock is use while on read side RCU read lock is applied.
