Btrfs: fix clone to deal with holes when NO_HOLES feature is enabled

If the NO_HOLES feature is enabled holes don't have file extent items in
the btree that represent them anymore. This made the clone operation
ignore the gaps that exist between consecutive file extent items and
therefore not create the holes at the destination. When not using the
NO_HOLES feature, the holes were created at the destination.

A test case for xfstests follows.
