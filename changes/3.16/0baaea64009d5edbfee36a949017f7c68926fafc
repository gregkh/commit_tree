ext4: use EXT_MAX_BLOCKS in ext4_es_can_be_merged()

In ext4_es_can_be_merged() when checking whether we can merge two
extents we should use EXT_MAX_BLOCKS instead of defining it manually.
Also if it is really the case we should notify userspace because clearly
there is a bug in extent status tree implementation since this should
never happen.
