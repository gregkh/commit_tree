powerpc/pseries: dynamically added OF nodes need to call of_node_init

Commit 75b57ecf9 refactored device tree nodes to use kobjects such that they
can be exposed via /sysfs. A secondary commit 0829f6d1f furthered this rework
by moving the kobect initialization logic out of of_node_add into its own
of_node_init function. The inital commit removed the existing kref_init calls
in the pseries dlpar code with the assumption kobject initialization would
occur in of_node_add. The second commit had the side effect of triggering a
BUG_ON during DLPAR, migration and suspend/resume operations as a result of
dynamically added nodes being uninitialized.

This patch fixes this by adding of_node_init calls in place of the previously
removed kref_init calls.
