Input: add common DT binding for touchscreens

Add common DT binding documentation for touchscreen devices and
implement input_parse_touchscreen_of_params, which parses the common
properties and configures the input device accordingly.

The method currently does not interpret the axis inversion properties,
since there is no matching flag in the generic linux input device.
