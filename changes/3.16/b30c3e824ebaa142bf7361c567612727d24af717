staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: separate from addi_common.c

Using the addi-data "common" code in addi_apci_1564 introduces a lot of
bloat.  By separating this driver off from addi_common.c, a lot of the
common code can be stripped out.  This patch copies the code over from
addi_common.c, and removes the #include of the file.  The auto_attach
function from the common code replaces the one that was previously in this
driver, though renamed to that it stays within the namespace associated
with this driver, and the detach function has been renamed for this reason
as well.
