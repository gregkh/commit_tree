mm: use the light version __mod_zone_page_state in mlocked_vma_newpage()

mlocked_vma_newpage() is called with pte lock held(a spinlock), which
implies preemtion disabled, and the vm stat counter is not modified from
interrupt context, so we need not use an irq-safe mod_zone_page_state()
here, using a light-weight version __mod_zone_page_state() would be OK.

This patch also documents __mod_zone_page_state() and some of its
callsites.  The comment above __mod_zone_page_state() is from Hugh
Dickins, and acked by Christoph.

Most credits to Hugh and Christoph for the clarification on the usage of
the __mod_zone_page_state().
