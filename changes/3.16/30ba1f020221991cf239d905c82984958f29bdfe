rbd: make sure we have latest osdmap on 'rbd map'

Given an existing idle mapping (img1), mapping an image (img2) in
a newly created pool (pool2) fails:

    $ ceph osd pool create pool1 8 8
    $ rbd create --size 1000 pool1/img1
    $ sudo rbd map pool1/img1
    $ ceph osd pool create pool2 8 8
    $ rbd create --size 1000 pool2/img2
    $ sudo rbd map pool2/img2
    rbd: sysfs write failed
    rbd: map failed: (2) No such file or directory

This is because client instances are shared by default and we don't
request an osdmap update when bumping a ref on an existing client.  The
fix is to use the mon_get_version request to see if the osdmap we have
is the latest, and block until the requested update is received if it's
not.
