of/fdt: add FDT address translation support

Copy u-boot's FDT address translation code from common/fdt_support. This
code was originally based on the kernel's unflattened DT address parsing
code.

This commit can be reverted once relicensing of this code to GPLv2/BSD
is done and it is added to libfdt.
