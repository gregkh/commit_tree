rbd: fix osd_request memory leak in __rbd_dev_header_watch_sync()

osd_request, along with r_request and r_reply messages attached to it
are leaked in __rbd_dev_header_watch_sync() if the requested image
doesn't exist.  This is because lingering requests are special and get
an extra ref in the reply path.  Fix it by unregistering linger request
on the error path and split __rbd_dev_header_watch_sync() into two
functions to make it maintainable.
