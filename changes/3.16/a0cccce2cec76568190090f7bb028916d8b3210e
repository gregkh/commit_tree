ixgbe: avoid duplicate code in suspend and stop paths

Resume path calls .open but suspend path cannot call .stop because
fdirs should not be freed and control over hardware should not be
released until WoL is configured.  To avoid having to duplicate all
changes made in .stop on suspend path split out part of .stop that
is relevant during suspend and call it from .stop and during suspend.

This fix also ensures that ixgbe_ptp_suspend is called during the
suspend path, and helps avoid similar errors. We can't call
ixgbe_ptp_stop, since it will free the PTP clock device, which we
shouldn't be doing during a suspend path.
