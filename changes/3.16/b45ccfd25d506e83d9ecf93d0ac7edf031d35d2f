xprtrdma: Remove MEMWINDOWS registration modes

The MEMWINDOWS and MEMWINDOWS_ASYNC memory registration modes were
intended as stop-gap modes before the introduction of FRMR. They
are now considered obsolete.

MEMWINDOWS_ASYNC is also considered unsafe because it can leave
client memory registered and exposed for an indeterminant time after
each I/O.

At this point, the MEMWINDOWS modes add needless complexity, so
remove them.
