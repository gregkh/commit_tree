GFS2: Only wait for demote when last holder is dequeued

Function gfs2_glock_dq_wait is supposed to dequeue a glock and then
wait for the lock to be demoted. The problem is, if this is a shared
lock, its demote will depend on the other holders, which means you
might end up waiting forever because the other process is blocked.
This problem is especially apparent when dealing with nested flocks.
