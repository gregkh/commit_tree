cgroup: replace cftype->write_string() with cftype->write()

Convert all cftype->write_string() users to the new cftype->write()
which maps directly to kernfs write operation and has full access to
kernfs and cgroup contexts.  The conversions are mostly mechanical.

* @css and @cft are accessed using of_css() and of_cft() accessors
  respectively instead of being specified as arguments.

* Should return @nbytes on success instead of 0.

* @buf is not trimmed automatically.  Trim if necessary.  Note that
  blkcg and netprio don't need this as the parsers already handle
  whitespaces.

cftype->write_string() has no user left after the conversions and
removed.

While at it, remove unnecessary local variable @p in
cgroup_subtree_control_write() and stale comment about
CGROUP_LOCAL_BUFFER_SIZE in cgroup_freezer.c.

This patch doesn't introduce any visible behavior changes.

v2: netprio was missing from conversion.  Converted.
