mm/page-writeback.c: remove outdated comment

There is an orphaned prehistoric comment , which used to be against
get_dirty_limits(), the dawn of global_dirtyable_memory().

Back then, the implementation of get_dirty_limits() is complicated and
full of magic numbers, so this comment is necessary.  But we now use the
clear and neat global_dirtyable_memory(), which renders this comment
ambiguous and useless.  Remove it.
