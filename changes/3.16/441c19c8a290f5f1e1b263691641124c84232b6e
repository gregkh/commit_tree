powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv: Rework the secondary inhibit code

As part of the support for split core on POWER8, we want to be able to
block splitting of the core while KVM VMs are active.

The logic to do that would be exactly the same as the code we currently
have for inhibiting onlining of secondaries.

Instead of adding an identical mechanism to block split core, rework the
secondary inhibit code to be a "HV KVM is active" check. We can then use
that in both the cpu hotplug code and the upcoming split core code.
