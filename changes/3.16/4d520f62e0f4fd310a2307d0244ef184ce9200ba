af_iucv: correct cleanup if listen backlog is full

In case of transport HIPER a sock struct is allocated for an incoming
connect request. If the backlog queue is full this socket is not
needed, but is left in the list of af_iucv sockets. Final socket
release posts console message "Attempt to release alive iucv socket".
This patch makes sure the new created socket is cleaned up correctly
if the backlog queue is full.
