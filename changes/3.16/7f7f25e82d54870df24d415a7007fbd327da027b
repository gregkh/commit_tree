replace checking for ->read/->aio_read presence with check in ->f_mode

Since we are about to introduce new methods (read_iter/write_iter), the
tests in a bunch of places would have to grow inconveniently.  Check
once (at open() time) and store results in ->f_mode as FMODE_CAN_READ
and FMODE_CAN_WRITE resp.  It might end up being a temporary measure -
once everything switches from ->aio_{read,write} to ->{read,write}_iter
it might make sense to return to open-coded checks.  We'll see...
