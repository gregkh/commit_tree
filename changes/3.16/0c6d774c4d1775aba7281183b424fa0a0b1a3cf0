serial: Add support for Advantech PCM-3614I/PCM-3618I serial expansion cards

Add support for Advantech PCM-3614I/PCM-3618I serial expansion cards

Advantech makes a variety of serial port expansion cards, including the
PCM-3614 and PCM-3618
(http://www.advantech.com/products/1-2JKLU5/PCM-3618/mod_5DF8DE5A-6B49-4429-BB2F-CB35FE1D168D.aspx).
They have a driver available which was forked from the kernel driver
ages ago and has not been maintained in quite some time, available at
http://support.advantech.com.tw/Support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-1W8FZ5&Doc_Source=Download
Their driver added several features to aid in communications at higher
baud rates, but at normal serial port speeds, the standard 8250_pci
driver functions just fine. This patch adds the necessary PCI IDs to
recognize this card.
