tipc: fix out of bounds indexing

Commit 78acb1f9b898e85fa2c1e28e700b54b66b288e8d ("tipc: add
ioctl to fetch link names") introduced a buffer overflow bug where
specially crafted ioctl requests could cause out-of-bounds indexing
of the node->links array. This was caused by an incorrect check vs
MAX_BEARERS, and the static code checker complaint is:
net/tipc/node.c:459 tipc_node_get_linkname() error: buffer overflow 'node->links' 2 <= 2
