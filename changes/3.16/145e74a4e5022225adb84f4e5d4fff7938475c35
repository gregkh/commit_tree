hwmon: (adm1031) Fix writes to limit registers

Upper limit for write operations to temperature limit registers
was clamped to a fractional value. However, limit registers do
not support fractional values. As a result, upper limits of 127.5
degrees C or higher resulted in a rounded limit of 128 degrees C.
Since limit registers are signed, this was stored as -128 degrees C.
Clamp limits to (-55, +127) degrees C to solve the problem.

Value on writes to auto_temp[12]_min and auto_temp[12]_max were not
clamped at all, but masked. As a result, out-of-range writes resulted
in a more or less arbitrary limit. Clamp those attributes to (0, 127)
degrees C for more predictable results.
