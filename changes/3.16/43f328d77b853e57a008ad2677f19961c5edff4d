drm/i915/chv: Preliminary interrupt support for Cherryview

CHV has the Gen8 master interrupt register, as well as Gen8
GT/PCU interrupt registers.

The display block is based on VLV, with the main difference
of adding pipe C.

v2: Rewrite the order of operations to make more sense
    Don't bail out if MASTER_CTL register doesn't show an interrupt,
    as display interrupts aren't reported there.

v3: Rebase on top of Egbert Eich's hpd irq handling rework by using
the relevant port hotplug logic like for vlv.

v4: Rebase on top of Ben's gt irq #define refactoring.

v5: Squash in gen8_gt_irq_handler refactoring from Zhao Yakui
<yakui.zhao@intel.com>

v6: Adapt to upstream changes, dev_priv->irq_received is gone.

v7: Enable 3 the commented-out 3 pipe support.

v8: Rebase on top of Paulo's irq setup rework, use the renamed macros from
upstream.

v9: Grab irq_lock around i915_enable_pipestat()

FIXME: There's probably some potential for more shared code between bdw and chv.
