f2fs: fix error path in init_inode_metadata

If we fail in this path:
->init_inode_metadata
  ->make_empty_dir
    ->get_new_data_page
      ->grab_cache_page return -ENOMEM

We will bug on in error path of init_inode_metadata when call remove_inode_page
because i_block = 2 (one inode block will be released later & one dentry block).

We should release the dentry block in init_inode_metadata to avoid this BUG_ON,
and avoid leak of dentry block resource, because we never have second chance to
release that block in ->evict_inode as in upper error path we make this inode
'bad'.
