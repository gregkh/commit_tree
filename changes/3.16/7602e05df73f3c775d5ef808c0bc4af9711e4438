mfd: ab8500: Fix dt irq mapping

The AD8500 defines itself as interrupt-controller in DT,
but it doesn't assign DT node to IRQ domain when creates it.
As result, of_irq_xx() helpers don't work because they can't
find necessary IRQ domain.

Hence, fix it by assigning AD8500 core device DT node to IRQ
domain when it's created.
