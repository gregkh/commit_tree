ARM: mvebu: prepare coherency code to support more SOCs

The code that handles the coherency fabric of Armada 370 and Armada XP
in arch/arm/mach-mvebu/coherency.c made the assumption that there was
only one type of coherency fabric. Unfortunately, it turns out that
upcoming SoCs have a slightly different coherency unit.

In preparation to the introduction of the coherency support for more
SoCs, this commit:

 * Introduces a data associated to the compatible string in the
   compatible string match table, so that the code can differantiate
   the variant of coherency unit being used.

 * Separates the coherency unit initialization code into its own
   function.
