powerpc: Clean up MMU_FTRS_A2 and MMU_FTR_TYPE_3E

In fb5a515704d7 "powerpc: Remove platforms/wsp and associated pieces",
we removed the last user of MMU_FTRS_A2. So remove it.

MMU_FTRS_A2 was the last user of MMU_FTR_TYPE_3E, so remove it also.
This leaves some unreachable code in mmu_context_nohash.c, so remove
that also.
