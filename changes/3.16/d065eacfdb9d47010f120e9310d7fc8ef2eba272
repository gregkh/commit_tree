locktorture: Remove reference to nonexistent Kconfig parameter

The locktorture module references CONFIG_LOCK_TORTURE_TEST_RUNNABLE,
which does not exist.  Which is a good thing, because otherwise
randconfig testing could enable both rcutorture and locktorture
concurrently, which the torture tests are not set up for.  This
commit therefore removes the reference, so that test is runnable
immediately only when inserted as a module.
