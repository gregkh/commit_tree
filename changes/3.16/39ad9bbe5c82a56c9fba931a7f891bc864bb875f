[media] m5mols: Replace missing header

The include/media/s5p_fimc.h header has been removed in commit
49b2f4c56fbf70ca693d6df1c491f0566d516aea ("exynos4-is: Remove support
for non-dt platforms"). This broke compilation of the m5mols driver.

Include the include/media/exynos-fimc.h header instead, which contains
the S5P_FIMC_TX_END_NOTIFY definition required by the driver.
