dm9000: clean up reset code

* Change a hard-coded 0x3 to NCR_RST | NCR_MAC_LBK in dm9000_reset

* Every single place where dm9000_init_dm9000 was ran, a dm9000_reset
  was called immediately before-hand.  Bring dm9000_reset into
  dm9000_init_dm9000.

* The following commit updated the dm9000_probe reset routine to use NCR_RST
  | NCR_MAC_LBK:

    6741f40 DM9000B: driver initialization upgrade

  and a later commit added a bug-fix to always reset the chip twice:

    09ee9f8 dm9000: Implement full reset of DM9000 network device

  Unfortunately, since the changes in 6741f40 were made by replacing the
  dm9000_probe dm9000_reset with the adjusted iow(), the changes in
  09ee9f8 were not incorporated into the dm9000_probe reset.
  Furthermore, it bypassed the requisite reset-delay causing some boards
  to get at least one "read wrong id ..." dev_err message during
  dm9000_probe.
