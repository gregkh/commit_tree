cpufreq: Make linux-pm@vger.kernel.org official mailing list

There has been confusion all the time about which mailing list to follow
for cpufreq activities, linux-pm@vger.kernel.org or cpufreq@vger.kernel.org.

Since patches sent to cpufreq@vger.kernel.org don't go to Patchwork
which is a maintenance workflow problem, make linux-pm@vger.kernel.org
the official mailing list for cpufreq stuff and remove all references
of cpufreq@vger.kernel.org from kernel source.

Later, we can request that the list be dropped entirely.
