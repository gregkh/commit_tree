locking/spinlocks/mcs: Micro-optimize osq_unlock()

In the unlock function of the cancellable MCS spinlock, the first
thing we do is to retrive the current CPU's osq node. However, due to
the changes made in the previous patch, in the common case where the
lock is not contended, we wouldn't need to access the current CPU's
osq node anymore.

This patch optimizes this by only retriving this CPU's osq node
after we attempt the initial cmpxchg to unlock the osq and found
that its contended.
