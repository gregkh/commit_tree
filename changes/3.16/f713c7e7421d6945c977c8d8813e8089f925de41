ARM: mvebu: Allow to power down L2 cache controller in idle mode

This commit adds a function which adjusts the PMSU configuration to
automatically power down the L2 and coherency fabric when we enter a
certain idle state.

This feature is part of the Power Management Service Unit of the
Armada 370 and Armada XP SoCs.
