USB: usb_wwan: fix write and suspend race

Fix race between write() and suspend() which could lead to writes being
dropped (or I/O while suspended) if the device is runtime suspended
while a write request is being processed.

Specifically, suspend() releases the susp_lock after determining the
device is idle but before setting the suspended flag, thus leaving a
window where a concurrent write() can submit an urb.

option driver")
