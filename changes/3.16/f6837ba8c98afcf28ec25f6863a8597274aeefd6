mac80211: handle failed restart/resume better

When the driver fails during HW restart or resume, the whole
stack goes into a very confused state with interfaces being
up while the hardware is down etc.

Address this by shutting down everything; we'll run into a
lot of warnings in the process but that's better than having
the whole stack get messed up.
