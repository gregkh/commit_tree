power: reset: keystone-reset: introduce keystone reset driver

The keystone SoC can be rebooted in several ways. By external reset
pin, by soft and by watchdogs. To allow keystone SoC reset if
watchdog is triggered we have to enable it in reset mux configuration
register regarding of watchdog configuration. Also we need to set
soft/hard reset we are going to use.

So add keystone reset driver to handle all this stuff.
