USB: cp210x: add support for Corsair usb dongle

Corsair USB Dongles are shipped with Corsair AXi series PSUs.
These are cp210x serial usb devices, so make driver detect these.
I have a program, that can get information from these PSUs.

Tested with 2 different dongles shipped with Corsair AX860i and
AX1200i units.
