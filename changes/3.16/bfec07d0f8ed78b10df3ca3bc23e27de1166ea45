f2fs: avoid overflow when large directory feathure is enabled

When large directory feathure is enable, We have one case which could cause
overflow in dir_buckets() as following:
special case: level + dir_level >= 32 and level < MAX_DIR_HASH_DEPTH / 2.

Here we define MAX_DIR_BUCKETS to limit the return value when the condition
could trigger potential overflow.

Changes from V1
 o modify description of calculation in f2fs.txt suggested by Changman Lee.
