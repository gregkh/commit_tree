spi: rspi: Remove unused 16-bit DMA support

The 16-bit DMA support doesn't fit well within the SPI core DMA framework,
as it needs to manage its own double-sized temporary buffers, for handling
the interleaved data.
Remove it, as there is no in-tree board code that sets
rspi_plat_data.dma_width_16bit.
