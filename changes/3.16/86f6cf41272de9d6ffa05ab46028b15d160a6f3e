net: of_mdio: add of_mdiobus_link_phydev()

Add a function to walk the list of subnodes of a mdio bus and look for
a node that matches the phy's address with its 'reg' property. If found,
set the of_node pointer for the phy. This allows auto-probed pyh
devices to be augmented by information passed in via DT.
