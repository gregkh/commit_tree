staging: comedi: cb_pcidas: fix the ao cmd->start_arg use for TRIG_INT

This driver only supports a cmd->start_src of TRIG_INT for ai commands. The
cmd->start_arg is trivially validated to be 0. For TRIG_INT source, the
cmd->start_arg is actually the valid trig_num that is passed to the async
(*inttrig) callback.

Refactor the (*inttrig) function so that the cmd->start_arg is used to check
the trig_num instead of the open coded value.
