ARM: OMAP5+: dpll: support Duty Cycle Correction(DCC)

Duty Cycle Correction(DCC) needs to be enabled if the MPU is to run at
frequencies beyond 1.4GHz for OMAP5, DRA75x, DRA72x.

MPU DPLL has a limitation on the maximum frequency it can be locked
at. Duty Cycle Correction circuit is used to recover a correct duty
cycle for achieving higher frequencies (hardware internally switches
output to M3 output(CLKOUTHIF) from M2 output (CLKOUT)).

For further information, See the note on OMAP5432 Technical Reference
Manual(SWPU282U) chapter 3.6.3.3.1 "DPLLs Output Clocks Parameters",
and also the "OMAP543x ES2.0 DM Operating Conditions Addendum v0.5"
chapter 2.1 "Micro Processor Unit (MPU)". Equivalent information is
present in relevant DRA75x, 72x documentation(SPRUHP2E, SPRUHI2P).
