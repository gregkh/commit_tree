fs/pstore: logging clean-up

- Define pr_fmt in plateform.c and ram_core.c for global prefix.

- Coalesce format fragments.

- Separate format/arguments on lines > 80 characters.

Note: Some pr_foo() were initially declared without prefix and therefore
this could break existing log analyzer.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: missed a couple of prefix removals]
