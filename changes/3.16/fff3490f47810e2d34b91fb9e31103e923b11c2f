Bluetooth: Fix setting correct authentication information for SMP STK

When we store the STK in slave role we should set the correct
authentication information for it. If the pairing is producing a HIGH
security level the STK is considered authenticated, and otherwise it's
considered unauthenticated. This patch fixes the value passed to the
hci_add_ltk() function when adding the STK on the slave side.
