kvm: fix wrong address when writing Hyper-V tsc page

When kvm_write_guest writes the tsc_ref structure to the guest, or it will lead
the low HV_X64_MSR_TSC_REFERENCE_ADDRESS_SHIFT bits of the TSC page address
must be cleared, or the guest can see a non-zero sequence number.

Otherwise Windows guests would not be able to get a correct clocksource
(QueryPerformanceCounter will always return 0) which causes serious chaos.
