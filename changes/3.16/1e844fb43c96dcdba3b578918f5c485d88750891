x86, vdso: Fix an OOPS accessing the HPET mapping w/o an HPET

The oops can be triggered in qemu using -no-hpet (but not nohpet) by
reading a couple of pages past the end of the vdso text.  This
should send SIGBUS instead of OOPSing.

The bug was introduced by:

commit 7a59ed415f5b57469e22e41fc4188d5399e0b194

    x86, vdso: Add 32 bit VDSO time support for 32 bit kernel

which is new in 3.15.

This will be fixed separately in 3.15, but that patch will not apply
to tip/x86/vdso.  This is the equivalent fix for tip/x86/vdso and,
presumably, 3.16.
