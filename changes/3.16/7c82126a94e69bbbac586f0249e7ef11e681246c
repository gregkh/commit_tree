PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk

After a CPU upgrade while keeping the same mainboard, we faced "spurious
interrupt" problems again.

It turned out that the new CPU also featured a new GPU with a different PCI
ID.

Add this PCI ID to the quirk table.  Probably all other Intel GPU PCI IDs
are affected, too, but I don't want to add them without a test system.

See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
Sandy Bridge GPUs") for some history.
