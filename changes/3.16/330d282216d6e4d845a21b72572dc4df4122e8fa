core: fix typo in percpu read_mostly section

This fixes a typo that named the read_mostly section of percpu as
readmostly. It works fine with SMP because the linker script specifies
.data..percpu..readmostly. However, UP kernel builds don't have percpu
sections defined and the non-percpu version of the section is called
data..read_mostly, so .data..readmostly will float around and may break
things unexpectedly.

Looking at the original change that introduced data..percpu..readmostly
(commit c957ef2c59e952803766ddc22e89981ab534606f), it looks like this
was the original intention.

Tested: Built UP kernel and confirmed the sections got merged.

- Before the patch:
$ objdump -h vmlinux.o  | grep '\.data\.\.read.*mostly'
38 .data..read_mostly 00004418  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00431ac0  2**6
50 .data..readmostly 00000014  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00444000  2**3

- After the patch:
$ objdump -h vmlinux.o  | grep '\.data\.\.read.*mostly'
38 .data..read_mostly 00004438  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00431ac0  2**6
