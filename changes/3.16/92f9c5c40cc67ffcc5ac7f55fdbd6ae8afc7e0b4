workqueue: rename manager_mutex to attach_mutex

manager_mutex is only used to protect the attaching for the pool
and the pool->workers list. It protects the pool->workers and operations
based on this list, such as:

	cpu-binding for the workers in the pool->workers
	the operations to set/clear WORKER_UNBOUND

So let's rename manager_mutex to attach_mutex to better reflect its
role. This patch is a pure rename.
