ftrace: Remove global function list and call function directly

Instead of having a list of global functions that are called,
as only one global function is allow to be enabled at a time, there's
no reason to have a list.

Instead, simply have all the users of the global ops, use the global ops
directly, instead of registering their own ftrace_ops. Just switch what
function is used before enabling the function tracer.

This removes a lot of code as well as the complexity involved with it.
