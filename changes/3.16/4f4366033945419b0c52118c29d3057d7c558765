irqchip: spear_shirq: Fix interrupt offset

The ras3 block on spear320 claims to have 3 interrupts. In fact it has
one and 6 reserved interrupts. Account the 6 reserved to this block so
it has 7 interrupts total. That matches the datasheet and the device
tree entries.

Broken since commit 80515a5a(ARM: SPEAr3xx: shirq: simplify and move
the shared irq multiplexor to DT). Testing is overrated....
