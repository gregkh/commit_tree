cgroup: use restart_syscall() for retries after offline waits in cgroup_subtree_control_write()

After waiting for a child to finish offline,
cgroup_subtree_control_write() jumps up to retry from after the input
parsing and active protection breaking.  This retry makes the
scheduled locking update - removal of cgroup_tree_mutex - more
difficult.  Let's simplify it by returning with restart_syscall() for
retries.
