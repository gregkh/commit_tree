ARM: mvebu: add Armada 375 support to the coherency code

The Armada 375, like the Armada 370 and Armada XP, has a coherency
unit. However, unlike the coherency unit of 370/XP which does both CPU
and I/O coherency, the one on Armada 735 only does I/O
coherency. Therefore, instead of having two sets of registers (the
first one being used mainly to register each CPU in the coherency
fabric, the second one being used for the I/O coherency barrier), it
has only one set of register (for the I/O coherency barrier).

This commit adds a new "marvell,armada-375-coherency-fabric"
compatible string for this variant of the coherency fabric. The custom
DMA operations, and the way of triggering an I/O barrier is the same
as Armada 370/XP, so the code changes are minimal. However, the
set_cpu_coherent() function is not needed on Armada 375 and will not
work.
