workqueue: convert worker_idr to worker_ida

We no longer iterate workers via worker_idr and worker_idr is used
only for allocating/freeing ID, so we can convert it to worker_ida.

By using ida_simple_get/remove(), worker_ida doesn't require external
synchronization, so we don't need manager_mutex to protect it and the
ID-removal code is allowed to be moved out from
worker_detach_from_pool().

In a later patch, worker_detach_from_pool() will be used in rescuers
which don't have IDs, so we move the ID-removal code out from
worker_detach_from_pool() into worker_thread().

tj: Minor description updates.
