printk/of_serial: fix serial console cessation part way through boot.

Commit 5f5c9ae56c38942623f69c3e6dc6ec78e4da2076
"serial_core: Unregister console in uart_remove_one_port()"
fixed a crash where a serial port was removed but
not deregistered as a console.

There is a side effect of that commit for platforms having serial consoles
and of_serial configured (CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM). The serial console
is disabled midway through the boot process.

This cessation of the serial console affects PowerPC computers
such as the MVME5100 and SAM440EP.

The sequence is:

	bootconsole [udbg0] enabled
	....
	serial8250/16550 driver initialises and registers its UARTS,
	one of these is the serial console.
	console [ttyS0] enabled
	....
	of_serial probes "platform" devices, registering them as it goes.
	One of these is the serial console.
	console [ttyS0] disabled.

The disabling of the serial console is due to:

	a.  unregister_console in printk not clearing the
	    CONS_ENABLED bit in the console flags,
	    even though it has announced that the console is disabled; and

	b.  of_platform_serial_probe in of_serial not setting the port type
	    before it registers with serial8250_register_8250_port.

This patch ensures that the serial console is re-enabled when of_serial
registers a serial port that corresponds to the designated console.

The above failure was identified in Linux-3.15-rc2.

Tested using MVME5100 and SAM440EP PowerPC computers with
kernels built from Linux-3.15-rc5 and tty-next.

The continued operation of the serial console is vital for computers
such as the MVME5100 as that Single Board Computer does not
have any grapical/display hardware.
