block: add support for limiting gaps in SG lists

Another restriction inherited for NVMe - those devices don't support
SG lists that have "gaps" in them. Gaps refers to cases where the
previous SG entry doesn't end on a page boundary. For NVMe, all SG
entries must start at offset 0 (except the first) and end on a page
boundary (except the last).
