ARM: mvebu: Fix broken SoC ID detection

Currently the mvebu boards need to detect the SoC revision in order to apply
some quirks needed to workaround issues found on I2C and thermal controllers
present only in very early SoC.

This detection requires PCI address translation to work, so we need to
explicitly select OF_ADDRESS_PCI.

This can be considered a partial revert of the following commit, that
wrongly removed the option selection:
