ALSA: Replace DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE macro use

We should prefer `const struct pci_device_id` over
`DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE` to meet kernel coding style guidelines.
This issue was reported by checkpatch.

A simplified version of the semantic patch that makes this change is as
follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

// <smpl>

@@
identifier i;
declarer name DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE;
initializer z;
@@

- DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE(i)
+ const struct pci_device_id i[]
= z;

// </smpl>

It has been tested by compilation.
