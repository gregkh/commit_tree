virtio_ccw: introduce device_lost in virtio_ccw_device

When a device is lost, the common I/O layer calls the notification
handler with CIO_GONE: In that event, flag device_lost as true.

In case the device had been flagged as lost when the remove/offline callbacks
are called, call the new virtio_break_device() function prior to invoking
device_unregister(). This avoids hangs of I/O triggered via the device
unregistration callbacks.
