drbd: prepare receiving side for REQ_DISCARD

If the receiver needs to serve a discard request on a queue that does
not announce to be discard cabable, it falls back to do synchronous
blkdev_issue_zeroout().

We expect only "reasonably" large (up to one activity log extent?)
discard requests.

We do this to not to not block the receiver for too long in this
fallback code path, and to not set/clear too many bits inside one
spinlock_irq_save() in drbd_set_in_sync/drbd_set_out_of_sync,
