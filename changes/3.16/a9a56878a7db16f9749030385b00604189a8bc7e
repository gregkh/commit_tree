brcmfmac: remove usage of cfg80211_get_chandef_type()

In the .start_ap callback cfg80211_get_chandef_type() was used to
provide debug log info. However, this causes a warning when the
chandef contains VHT channel with 80MHz bandwidth. Avoid the warning
by just printing the channel and bandwidth instead.
