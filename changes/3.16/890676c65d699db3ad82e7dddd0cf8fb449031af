kbuild: Use relative path when building in the source tree

When not using O=, $(srctree) refers to the same directory as
$(objtree), so we can set it to '.' as well. This makes the default
include path more compact and results in more readable messages from the
compiler. The only case where we need the absolute path is when creating
the 'source' symlink in /lib/modules.
