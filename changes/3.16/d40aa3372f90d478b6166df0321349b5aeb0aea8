nfsd: Remove assignments inside conditions

Assignments should not happen inside an if conditional, but in the line
before. This issue was reported by checkpatch.

The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

// <smpl>

@@
identifier i1;
expression e1;
statement S;
@@
-if(!(i1 = e1)) S
+i1 = e1;
+if(!i1)
+S

// </smpl>

It has been tested by compilation.
