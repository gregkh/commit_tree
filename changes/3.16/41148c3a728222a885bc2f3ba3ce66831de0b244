spi: sirf: decrease the interrupt count and latency of PIO mode

current PIO tranfer method be described as follows:
1. fill as much as bytes but no more than 256 bytes(fifo size)
2. enable oflow/uflow/txfifo_empty interrupt
3. isr process 3 interrupt signal, do complete works.
4. after isr done, if there are left bytes go into 1 else go into 5
5. transfer end

by current PIO transfer method:
1. reduce interrupt counts in spi interrupt line.
2. reduce interrupt latency because no do data fill/fetch in isr.
