coredump: fix the setting of PF_DUMPCORE

Commit 079148b919d0 ("coredump: factor out the setting of PF_DUMPCORE")
cleaned up the setting of PF_DUMPCORE by removing it from all the
linux_binfmt->core_dump() and moving it to zap_threads().But this ended
up clearing all the previously set flags.  This causes issues during
core generation when tsk->flags is checked again (eg.  for PF_USED_MATH
to dump floating point registers).  Fix this.
