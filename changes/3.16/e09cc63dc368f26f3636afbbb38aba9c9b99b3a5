brcmfmac: Give priority to 5GHz band in selecting target BSS

When a BSS provides both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, in many cases it
makes sense to choose 5GHz. Typically a 5GHz channel is less crowded
and has less interference and therefore its performance will be
better than a crowded 2.4 GHz channel. This patch configures
'join_pref' to induce firmware to preferably select 5GHz BSS.
