perf: Always destroy groups on exit

Commit 38b435b16c36 ("perf: Fix tear-down of inherited group events")
states that we need to destroy groups for inherited events, but it
doesn't make any sense to not also destroy groups for normal events.

And while it usually makes no difference (the normal events won't
leak, and its very likely all the group events will die in quick
succession) it does make the code more consistent and closes a
potential hole for trouble.
