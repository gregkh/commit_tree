sched: Do not zero sg->cpumask and sg->sgp->power in build_sched_groups()

There is no need to zero struct sched_group member cpumask and struct
sched_group_power member power since both structures are already allocated
as zeroed memory in __sdt_alloc().

This patch has been tested with
BUG_ON(!cpumask_empty(sched_group_cpus(sg))); and BUG_ON(sg->sgp->power);
in build_sched_groups() on ARM TC2 and INTEL i5 M520 platform including
CPU hotplug scenarios.
