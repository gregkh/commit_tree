btrfs: Add check to avoid cleanup roots already in fs_info->dead_roots.

Current btrfs_orphan_cleanup will also cleanup roots which is already in
fs_info->dead_roots without protection.
This will have conditional race with fs_info->cleaner_kthread.

This patch will use refs in root->root_item to detect roots in
dead_roots and avoid conflicts.
