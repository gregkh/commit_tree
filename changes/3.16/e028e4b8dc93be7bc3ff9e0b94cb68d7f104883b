bridge: Keep track of ports capable of automatic discovery.

By default, ports on the bridge are capable of automatic
discovery of nodes located behind the port.  This is accomplished
via flooding of unknown traffic (BR_FLOOD) and learning the
mac addresses from these packets (BR_LEARNING).
If the above functionality is disabled by turning off these
flags, the port requires static configuration in the form
of static FDB entries to function properly.

This patch adds functionality to keep track of all ports
capable of automatic discovery.  This will later be used
to control promiscuity settings.
