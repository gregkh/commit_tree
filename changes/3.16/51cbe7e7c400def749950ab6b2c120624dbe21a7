x86, MCE: Robustify mcheck_init_device

BorisO reports that misc_register() fails often on xen. The current code
unregisters the CPU hotplug notifier in that case. If then a CPU is
offlined and onlined back again, we end up with a second timer running
on that CPU, leading to soft lockups and system hangs.

So let's leave the hotcpu notifier always registered - even if
mce_device_create failed for some cores and never unreg it so that we
can deal with the timer handling accordingly.
