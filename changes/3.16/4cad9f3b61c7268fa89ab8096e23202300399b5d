be2net: set EQ DB clear-intr bit in be_open()

On BE3, if the clear-interrupt bit of the EQ doorbell is not set the first
time it is armed, ocassionally we have observed that the EQ doesn't raise
anymore interrupts even if it is in armed state.
This patch fixes this by setting the clear-interrupt bit when EQs are
armed for the first time in be_open().
