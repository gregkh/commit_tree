drivers: Remove duplicate conditionally included subdirs

The "macintosh" and "nfs" subdirectories are already traversed
unconditionally, so there's no need to keep the conditional entries.

The unconditional "macintosh" entry used to depend on CONFIG_PPC_PMAC,
but the dependency was dropped in commit
45941d0481f538324fa21d6450116d13f6e51e91 ("[PATCH] enable mouse button 2+3
emulation for x86 macs"), forgetting the second entry for CONFIG_MAC.

The two "nfc" entries were introduced by two separate commits: commit
0329326e85aaa30fb8d427828c718d565c287385 ("NFC: Driver for NXP
Semiconductors PN544 NFC chip."), and commit
3e256b8f8dfa309a80b5dece388d85d9a9801a29 ("NFC: add nfc subsystem core").
