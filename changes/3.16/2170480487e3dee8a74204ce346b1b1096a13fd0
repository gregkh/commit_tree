mtd: fsl_ifc_nand: Workaround bogus WP on 16-bit NAND

A workaround was already in place that set the WP bit in the
IFC_CSPR0 register after a STATUS command, however it used an 8-bit
write method. As a result, the WP bit was never set on 16-bit devices,
and these devices would eventually be incorrectly marked as
write-protected.

This patch checks the chip options for a 16-bit device and uses the
appropriate write method to set the WP bit after a STATUS command.
