staging: ion: remove struct ion_page_pool_item

The page pool uses an internal data structure, ion_page_pool_item, for
wrapping pooled pages and constructing a list. As the struct page
already provides ways for doing exactly the same thing, we do not need
to reinvent the wheel. This commit removes the data structure and slab
allocations for it.
