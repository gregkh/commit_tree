regulator: max14577: Add support for MAX77836 regulators

Add support for MAX77836 chipset and its additional two LDO regulators.
These LDO regulators are controlled by the PMIC block with additional
regmap (different I2C slave address).

The MAX77836 charger and safeout regulators are almost identical to
MAX14577. The registers layout is the same, except values for charger's
current. The patch adds simple mapping between device type and supported
current by the charger regulator.
