parport: Add support for the WCH353 1S/1P multi-IO card

This Multi-IO card has one serial 16550-like and one parallel port connector.
Here's the lspci output, after this commit is applied:

03:07.0 Serial controller: Device 4348:5053 (rev 10) (prog-if 02 [16550])
	Subsystem: Device 4348:5053
	Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster- SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx-
	Status: Cap- 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR- INTx-
	Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 21
	Region 0: I/O ports at cf00 [size=8]
	Region 1: I/O ports at ce00 [size=8]
	Kernel driver in use: parport_serial
	Kernel modules: 8250_pci, parport_serial

This commit adds an entry with the device ID to the blacklist declared in
8250_pci to prevent the driver from taking ownership. Also, and as was done
for the 2S/1P variant, add a quirk to skip autodetection and set the correct
type to 16550A clone.

Proper entries are added to parport_serial, to support the device parallel
and serial ports.
