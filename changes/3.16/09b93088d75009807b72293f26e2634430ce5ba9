IB: Add a QP creation flag to use GFP_NOIO allocations

This addresses a problem where NFS client writes over IPoIB connected
mode may deadlock on memory allocation/writeback.

The problem is not directly memory reclamation.  There is an indirect
dependency between network filesystems writing back pages and
ipoib_cm_tx_init() due to how a kworker is used.  Page reclaim cannot
make forward progress until ipoib_cm_tx_init() succeeds and it is
stuck in page reclaim itself waiting for network transmission.
Ordinarily this situation may be avoided by having the caller use
GFP_NOFS but ipoib_cm_tx_init() does not have that information.

To address this, take a general approach and add a new QP creation
flag that tells the low-level hardware driver to use GFP_NOIO for the
memory allocations related to the new QP.

Use the new flag in the ipoib connected mode path, and if the driver
doesn't support it, re-issue the QP creation without the flag.
