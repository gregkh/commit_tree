ARM: orion5x: move interrupt controller node into ocp

The interrupt controller node was located outside of the ocp@f1000000
node, which doesn't make much sense: like any other device, the
interrupt controller has registers located in the "Internal Registers
Window", so it is much more logical to have it under the ocp@f1000000
node.

It is even more important as we are going to move Orion5x to use the
Device Tree binding of the mvebu-mbus driver.
