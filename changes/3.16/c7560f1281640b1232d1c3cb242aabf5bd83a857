drm: Fix getconnector connection_mutex locking

I've fumbled my own idea and enthusiastically wrapped all the
getconnector code with the connection_mutex. But we only need it to
chase the connector->encoder link. Even there it's not really needed
since races with userspace won't matter, but better paranoid and
consistent about this stuff.

If we grap it everywhere connector probe callbacks can't grab it
themselves, which means they'll deadlock. i915 does that for the load
detect pipe. Furthermore i915 needs to do a ww dance since we also
need to grab the mutex of the load detect crtc.

This is a regression from
