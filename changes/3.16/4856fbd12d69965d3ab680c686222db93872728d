[media] staging: tighten omap4iss dependencies

The OMAP4 camera support depends on I2C and VIDEO_V4L2, both
of which can be loadable modules. This causes build failures
if we want the camera driver to be built-in.

This can be solved by turning the option into "tristate",
which unfortunately causes another problem, because the
driver incorrectly calls a platform-internal interface
for omap4_ctrl_pad_readl/omap4_ctrl_pad_writel.

Instead, this patch just forbids the invalid configurations
and ensures that the driver can only be built if all its
dependencies are built-in.
