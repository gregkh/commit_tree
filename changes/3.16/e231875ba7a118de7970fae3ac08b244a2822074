mm: memcontrol: clean up memcg zoneinfo lookup

Memcg zoneinfo lookup sites have either the page, the zone, or the node
id and zone index, but sites that only have the zone have to look up the
node id and zone index themselves, whereas sites that already have those
two integers use a function for a simple pointer chase.

Provide mem_cgroup_zone_zoneinfo() that takes a zone pointer and let
sites that already have node id and zone index - all for each node, for
each zone iterators - use &memcg->nodeinfo[nid]->zoneinfo[zid].

Rename page_cgroup_zoneinfo() to mem_cgroup_page_zoneinfo() to match.
