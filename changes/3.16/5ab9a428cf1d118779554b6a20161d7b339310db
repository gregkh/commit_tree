ARM: S3C24XX: prevent conflicts between ccf and non-ccf s3c24xx-socs

As the conversion to the common-clock-framework is done in multiple
steps, it is necessary to prevent conflicts between the different
struct clk implementations.

For this include the s3c24xx_setup_clocks function only when
SAMSUNG_CLOCK is selected and make the socs we don't convert this
time explicitly depend on SAMSUNG_CLOCK, which gets only selected
automatically if COMMON_CLK is not enabled.
