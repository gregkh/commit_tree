[media] ARM: S5PV210: Remove camera support from mach-goni.c

S5PV210 is going to get DT support, so we can remove the camera
bits from the only board using camera on S5PV210. This allows to
clean the exynos4-is driver by dropping code for non-dt platforms.
This patch can be dropped if a patch removing the whole board
file is applied first.
