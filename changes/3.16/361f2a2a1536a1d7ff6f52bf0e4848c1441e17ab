powrpc/powernv: Reset PHB in kdump kernel

In the kdump scenario, the first kerenl doesn't shutdown PCI devices
and the kdump kerenl clean PHB IODA table at the early probe time.
That means the kdump kerenl can't support PCI transactions piled
by the first kerenl. Otherwise, lots of EEH errors and frozen PEs
will be detected.

In order to avoid the EEH errors, the PHB is resetted to drop all
PCI transaction from the first kerenl.
