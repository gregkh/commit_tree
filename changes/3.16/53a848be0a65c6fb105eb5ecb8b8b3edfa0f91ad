bus: omap_l3_noc: Add DRA7 interconnect error data

DRA7 is distinctly different from OMAP4 in terms of masters and clock
domain organization. There two main clock domains which is divided as
follows:
     <0x44000000 0x1000000> is clk1 and clk2 is the sub clock domain
     <0x45000000 0x1000> is clk3

Add all the data needed to handle L3 error handling on DRA7 devices
and mark clk2 as subdomain and provide a compatible flag for
functionality. Other than the data difference the hardware blocks
involved are essentially the same.
