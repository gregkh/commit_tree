cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: fix CPU_THERMAL dependency

5fbfbcd3e842d ("cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: remove dependency on THERMAL and
REGULATOR") was a little too quick in completely removing the dependency
on the THERMAL driver.

The problem is that while there are inline wrappers to turn the thermal
API calls into empty functions, those do not help if the cpu-thermal
driver is a loadable module and cpufreq-cpu0 is builtin.

Since CONFIG_CPU_THERMAL is a bool option that decides whether the cpu
code is built into the thermal module or not, we have to use a dependency
on the thermal driver itself. However, if CPU_THERMAL is disabled, we
don't need the dependency, hence the strange '!CPU_THERMAL || THERMAL'
construct.
