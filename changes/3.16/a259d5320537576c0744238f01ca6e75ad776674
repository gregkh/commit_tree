m68k/atari - ide: do not register interrupt if host->get_lock is set

On m68k, host->get_lock is used to both lock and register the interrupt
that the IDE host shares with other device drivers. Registering the
IDE interrupt handler in ide-probe.c results in duplicating the
interrupt registered (once via host->get lock, and also via init_irq()),
and may result in IDE accepting interrupts even when another driver has
locked the interrupt hardware. This opens the whole locking scheme up
to races.

host->get_lock is set on m68k only, so other drivers' behaviour is not
changed.
