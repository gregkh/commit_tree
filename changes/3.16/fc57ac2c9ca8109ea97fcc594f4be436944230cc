KVM: lapic: sync highest ISR to hardware apic on EOI

When Hyper-V enlightenments are in effect, Windows prefers to issue an
Hyper-V MSR write to issue an EOI rather than an x2apic MSR write.
The Hyper-V MSR write is not handled by the processor, and besides
being slower, this also causes bugs with APIC virtualization.  The
reason is that on EOI the processor will modify the highest in-service
interrupt (SVI) field of the VMCS, as explained in section 29.1.4 of
the SDM; every other step in EOI virtualization is already done by
apic_send_eoi or on VM entry, but this one is missing.

We need to do the same, and be careful not to muck with the isr_count
and highest_isr_cache fields that are unused when virtual interrupt
delivery is enabled.
