tracing: Fix syscall_*regfunc() vs copy_process() race

syscall_regfunc() and syscall_unregfunc() should set/clear
TIF_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINT system-wide, but do_each_thread() can race
with copy_process() and miss the new child which was not added to
the process/thread lists yet.

Change copy_process() to update the child's TIF_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINT
under tasklist.
