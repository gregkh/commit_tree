hpsa: fix event filtering to prevent excessive rescans with old firmware

CTLR_STATE_CHANGE_EVENT and CTLR_STATE_CHANGE_EVENT_REDUNDANT_CNTRL
do not require rescans to be initiated.  Current firmware filters out
these events already, but some out of date firmware doesn't, so the
driver needs to filter them out too.  Without this change and with out
of date firmware you may see the driver spending a lot of time
scanning devices unnecessarily on some Smart Arrays.
