ocfs2/dlm: do not purge lockres that is queued for assert master

When workqueue is delayed, it may occur that a lockres is purged while it
is still queued for master assert.  it may trigger BUG() as follows.

N1                                         N2
dlm_get_lockres()
->dlm_do_master_requery
                                  is the master of lockres,
                                  so queue assert_master work

                                  dlm_thread() start running
                                  and purge the lockres

                                  dlm_assert_master_worker()
                                  send assert master message
                                  to other nodes
receiving the assert_master
message, set master to N2

dlmlock_remote() send create_lock message to N2, but receive DLM_IVLOCKID,
if it is RECOVERY lockres, it triggers the BUG().

Another BUG() is triggered when N3 become the new master and send
assert_master to N1, N1 will trigger the BUG() because owner doesn't
match.  So we should not purge lockres when it is queued for assert
master.
