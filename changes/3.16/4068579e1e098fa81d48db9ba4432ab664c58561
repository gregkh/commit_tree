net: Implmement RFC 6936 (zero RX csums for UDP/IPv6)

RFC 6936 relaxes the requirement of RFC 2460 that UDP/IPv6 packets which
are received with a zero UDP checksum value must be dropped. RFC 6936
allows zero checksums to support tunnels over UDP.

When sk_no_check is set we allow on a socket we allow a zero IPv6
UDP checksum. This is for both sending zero checksum and accepting
a zero checksum on receive.
