net: cdc_ncm: allow tuning min_tx_pkt

The min_tx_pkt variable decides the cutoff point where the driver
will stop padding out NTBs to maximum size. The padding is a tradeoff
where we use some USB bus bandwidth to allow the device to receive
fixed size buffers. Different devices will have different optimal
settings, spanning from no padding at all to padding every NTB.
There is no way to automatically figure out which setting is best
for a specific device.

The default value is a reasonable tradeoff, calculated based on the
USB packet size and out NTB max size. This may have to be changed
along with any tx_max changes.
