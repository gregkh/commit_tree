PCI: Add function 0 DMA alias quirk for Ricoh devices

The existing quirk for these devices (pci_get_dma_source()) doesn't really
solve the problem; re-implement it using the DMA alias iterator.  We'll
come back later and remove the existing quirk and dma_source interface.
Note that device ID 0xe822 is typically function 0 and 0xe230 has been
tested to not need the quirk and are therefore removed versus the
equivalent dma_source quirk.  If there exist in other configurations we can
re-add them.
