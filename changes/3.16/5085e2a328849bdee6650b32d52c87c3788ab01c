sched/numa: Retry placement more frequently when misplaced

When tasks have not converged on their preferred nodes yet, we want
to retry fairly often, to make sure we do not migrate a task's memory
to an undesirable location, only to have to move it again later.

This patch reduces the interval at which migration is retried,
when the task's numa_scan_period is small.
