rbd: only set disk to read-only once

rbd_open(), called every time the device is opened, calls
set_device_ro().  There's no reason to set the device read-only or
read-write every time it is opened. Just do this once during device
setup, using set_disk_ro() instead because the struct block_device
isn't available to us there.
