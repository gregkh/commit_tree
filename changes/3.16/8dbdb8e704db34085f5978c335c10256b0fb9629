ARM: mvebu: Fix the improper use of the compatible string armada38x using a wildcard

Wildcards in compatible strings should be avoid. "marvell,armada38x"
was recently introduced but was not yet used.

The armada 385 SoC is a superset of the armada 380 SoC (with more CPUs
and more PCIe slots). So this patch replaces the use of
"marvell,armada38x" by the "marvell,armada380" string.
