ACPI / LPSS: Take I2C host controllers out of reset

On Intel Baytrail, some I2C host controllers are held in reset when the OS
gets control. This causes the driver to fail to detect the hardware
properly.

Fix this so that we make sure that the I2C host controller is not in reset
when the driver gets probe'd.
