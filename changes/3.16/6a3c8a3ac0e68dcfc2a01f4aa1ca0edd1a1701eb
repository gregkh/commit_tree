blk-mq: initialize req->q in allocation

The patch basically reverts the patch of(blk-mq:
initialize request on allocation) in Jens's tree(already
in -next), and only initialize req->q in allocation
for two reasons:

	- presumed cache hotness on completion
	- blk_rq_tagged(rq) depends on reset of req->mq_ctx
