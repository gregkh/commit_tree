drm/plane: Fix sparse warnings

Include the drm_plane_helper.h header file to fix the following sparse
warnings:

	  CHECK   drivers/gpu/drm/drm_plane_helper.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_plane_helper.c:102:5: warning: symbol 'drm_primary_helper_update' was not declared. Should it be static?
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_plane_helper.c:219:5: warning: symbol 'drm_primary_helper_disable' was not declared. Should it be static?
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_plane_helper.c:233:6: warning: symbol 'drm_primary_helper_destroy' was not declared. Should it be static?
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_plane_helper.c:241:30: warning: symbol 'drm_primary_helper_funcs' was not declared. Should it be static?
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_plane_helper.c:259:18: warning: symbol 'drm_primary_helper_create_plane' was not declared. Should it be static?

Doing that makes gcc complain as follows:

Which can easily be fixed by making the signatures of the implementation
and the prototype match.
