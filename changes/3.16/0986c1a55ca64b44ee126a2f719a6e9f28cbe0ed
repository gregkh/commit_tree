drm/radeon: stop poisoning the GART TLB

When we set the valid bit on invalid GART entries they are
loaded into the TLB when an adjacent entry is loaded. This
poisons the TLB with invalid entries which are sometimes
not correctly removed on TLB flush.

For stable inclusion the patch probably needs to be modified a bit.
