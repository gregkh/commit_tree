usb: assign usb3 external hub port peers

Given that root hub port peers are already established, external hub peer
ports can be determined by traversing the device topology:

1/ ascend to the parent hub and find the upstream port_dev

2/ walk ->peer to find the peer port

3/ descend to the peer hub via ->child

4/ find the port with the matching port id

Note that this assumes the port labeling scheme required by the
specification [1].
