x86, espfix: Make espfix64 a Kconfig option, fix UML

Make espfix64 a hidden Kconfig option.  This fixes the x86-64 UML
build which had broken due to the non-existence of init_espfix_bsp()
in UML: since UML uses its own Kconfig, this option does not appear in
the UML build.

This also makes it possible to make support for 16-bit segments a
configuration option, for the people who want to minimize the size of
the kernel.
