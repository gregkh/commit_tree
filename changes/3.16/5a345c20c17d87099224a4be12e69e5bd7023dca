USB: cdc-acm: fix write and suspend race

Fix race between write() and suspend() which could lead to writes being
dropped (or I/O while suspended) if the device is runtime suspended
while a write request is being processed.

Specifically, suspend() releases the write_lock after determining the
device is idle but before incrementing the susp_count, thus leaving a
window where a concurrent write() can submit an urb.

that support remote wakeup")
