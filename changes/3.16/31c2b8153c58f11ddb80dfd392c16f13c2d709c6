PCI: Add support for DMA alias quirks

Some devices are broken and use a requester ID other than their physical
devfn.  Add a byte, using an existing gap in the pci_dev structure, to
store an alternate "alias" devfn.  A bit in the dev_flags tells us when
this is valid.  We then add the alias as one more step in the
pci_for_each_dma_alias() iterator.
