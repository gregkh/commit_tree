net: systemport: fix transmit locking scheme

Our transmit locking scheme did not account for the TX ring full
interrupt. If a TX ring full interrupt fires while we are attempting to
transmit, we will cause a deadlock to occur. Fix this by making sure
that we properly disable interrupts while acquiring the spinlock.
