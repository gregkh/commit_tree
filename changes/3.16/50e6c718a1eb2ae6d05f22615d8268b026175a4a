ASoC: simple-card: Drop node->name checking

The current simple-card driver limits the DT node name to "sound".
Any of other names is forbidden while actually we should allow DT
to pass other node names.

And if this function is being called, the node must already have
the compatible "simple-audio-card" in DTB. So there should be no
need to check the name here.
