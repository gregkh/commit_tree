xfs: turn NLINK feature on by default

mkfs has turned on the XFS_SB_VERSION_NLINKBIT feature bit by
default since November 2007. It's about time we simply made the
kernel code turn it on by default and so always convert v1 inodes to
v2 inodes when reading them in from disk or allocating them. This
This removes needless version checks and modification when bumping
link counts on inodes, and will take code out of a few common code
paths.
