ASoC: Intel: Use ACPI device for Baytrail PCM buffer allocation

This follows the same idea than commit 10df350977b1
("ASoC: Intel: Fix Audio DSP usage when IOMMU is enabled.") by using only
ACPI device for all DMA allocations. Since DMA masking is already done in
firmware loading it can be removed from here.
