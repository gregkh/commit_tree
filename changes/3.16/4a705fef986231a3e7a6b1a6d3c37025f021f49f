hugetlb: fix copy_hugetlb_page_range() to handle migration/hwpoisoned entry

There's a race between fork() and hugepage migration, as a result we try
to "dereference" a swap entry as a normal pte, causing kernel panic.
The cause of the problem is that copy_hugetlb_page_range() can't handle
"swap entry" family (migration entry and hwpoisoned entry) so let's fix
it.
