sched/numa: Allow task switch if load imbalance improves

Currently the NUMA balancing code only allows moving tasks between NUMA
nodes when the load on both nodes is in balance. This breaks down when
the load was imbalanced to begin with.

Allow tasks to be moved between NUMA nodes if the imbalance is small,
or if the new imbalance is be smaller than the original one.
