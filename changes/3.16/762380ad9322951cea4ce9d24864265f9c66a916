block: add notion of a chunk size for request merging

Some drivers have different limits on what size a request should
optimally be, depending on the offset of the request. Similar to
dividing a device into chunks. Add a setting that allows the driver
to inform the block layer of such a chunk size. The block layer will
then prevent merging across the chunks.

This is needed to optimally support NVMe with a non-zero stripe size.
