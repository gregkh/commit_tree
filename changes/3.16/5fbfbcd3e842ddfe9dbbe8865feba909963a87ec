cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: remove dependency on THERMAL and REGULATOR

cpufreq-cpu0 uses thermal framework to register a cooling device, but doesn't
depend on it as there are dummy calls provided by thermal layer when
CONFIG_THERMAL=n. And when these calls fail, the driver is still usable.

Similar explanation is valid for regulators as well. We do have dummy calls
available for regulator APIs and the driver can work even when those calls
fail.

So, we don't really need to mention thermal and regulators as a dependency for
cpufreq-cpu0 in Kconfig as platforms without support for thermal/regulator can
also use this driver. Remove this dependency.
