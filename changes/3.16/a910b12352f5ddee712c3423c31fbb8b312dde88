drbd: perpare for genetlink parallel_ops

Because all administrative requests via genetlink have been globally
serialized via genl_lock(), we used to have one static struct
drbd_config_context "admin context".

Move this on-stack to the respective callback functions.

This will allow us to selectively drop the genl_lock()
(or use genl_family->parallel_ops) in the future.
