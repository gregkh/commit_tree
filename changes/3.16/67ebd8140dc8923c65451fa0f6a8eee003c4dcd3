PCI: Fix incorrect vgaarb conditional in WARN_ON()

3448a19da479 "vgaarb: use bridges to control VGA routing where possible"
added the "flags & PCI_VGA_STATE_CHANGE_DECODES" condition to an existing
WARN_ON(), but used bitwise AND (&) instead of logical AND (&&), so the
condition is never true.  Replace with logical AND.

Found by Coverity (CID 142811).
