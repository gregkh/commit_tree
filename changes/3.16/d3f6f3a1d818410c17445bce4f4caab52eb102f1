tg3: Prevent page allocation failure during TSO workaround

If any TSO fragment hits hardware bug conditions (e.g. 4G boundary), the
driver will workaround by calling skb_copy() to copy to a linear SKB.  Users
have reported page allocation failures as the TSO packet can be up to 64K.
Copying such a large packet is also very inefficient.  We fix this by using
existing tg3_tso_bug() to transmit the packet using GSO.
