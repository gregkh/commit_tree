hyperv: Remove recv_pkt_list and lock

Removed recv_pkt_list and lock, and updated related code, so that
the locking overhead is reduced especially when multiple channels
are in use.

The recv_pkt_list isn't actually necessary because the packets are
processed sequentially in each channel. It has been replaced by a
local variable, and the related lock for this list is also removed.
The is_data_pkt field is not used in receive path, so its assignment
is cleaned up.
