rcutorture: Explicitly test synchronous grace-period primitives

The original rcu_torture_writer() avoided testing the synchronous
grace-period primitives because they were simply wrappers around
call_rcu() invocations.  The testing of these synchronous primitives
was delegated to the fake writers.  However, there really is no excuse
not to test them, especially in the case of SRCU, where the wrappering
is somewhat more elaborate.  This commit therefore makes the default
rcutorture parameters cause rcu_torture_writer() to include synchronous
grace-period primitives in its testing.
