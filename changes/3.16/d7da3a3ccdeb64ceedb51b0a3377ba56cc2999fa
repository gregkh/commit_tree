Input: wacom - cleanup multitouch code when touch_max is 2

Historically we dealt with touch_max equals to 2 differently from
other MT devices. Now we use input_mt_*() to process all MT events,
as long as touch_max is greater than 1. So, there is no need to
take (touch_max == 2) as a special case any more.
