usb: gadget: f_fs: fix NULL pointer dereference when there are no strings

If the descriptors do not need any strings and user space sends empty
set of strings, the ffs->stringtabs field remains NULL.  Thus
*ffs->stringtabs in functionfs_bind leads to a NULL pointer
dereferenece.

The bug was introduced by commit [fd7c9a007f: “use usb_string_ids_n()”].

While at it, remove double initialisation of lang local variable in
that function.

ffs->strings_count does not need to be checked in any way since in
the above scenario it will remain zero and usb_string_ids_n() is
a no-operation when colled with 0 argument.
