drivers/rtc/interface.c: fix infinite loop in initializing the alarm

In __rtc_read_alarm(), if the alarm time retrieved by
rtc_read_alarm_internal() from the device contains invalid values (e.g.
month=2,mday=31) and the year not set (=-1), the initialization will
loop infinitely because the year-fixing loop expects the time being
invalid due to leap year.

Fix reduces the loop to the leap years and adds final validity check.
