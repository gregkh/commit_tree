KVM: s390: Improve is_valid_psw()

As a program status word is also invalid (and thus generates an
specification exception) if the instruction address is not even,
we should test this in is_valid_psw(), too. This patch also exports
the function so that it becomes available for other parts of the
S390 KVM code as well.
