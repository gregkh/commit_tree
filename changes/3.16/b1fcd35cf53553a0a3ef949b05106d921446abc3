net: filter: let unattached filters use sock_fprog_kern

The sk_unattached_filter_create() API is used by BPF filters that
are not directly attached or related to sockets, and are used in
team, ptp, xt_bpf, cls_bpf, etc. As such all users do their own
internal managment of obtaining filter blocks and thus already
have them in kernel memory and set up before calling into
sk_unattached_filter_create(). As a result, due to __user annotation
in sock_fprog, sparse triggers false positives (incorrect type in
assignment [different address space]) when filters are set up before
passing them to sk_unattached_filter_create(). Therefore, let
sk_unattached_filter_create() API use sock_fprog_kern to overcome
this issue.
