xfs: introduce directory geometry structure

The directory code has a dependency on the struct xfs_mount to
supply the directory block geometry. Block size, block log size,
and other parameters are pre-caclulated in the struct xfs_mount or
access directly from the superblock embedded in the struct
xfs_mount.

Extract all of this geometry information out of the struct xfs_mount
and superblock and place it into a new struct xfs_da_geometry
defined by the directory code. Allocate and initialise it at mount
time, and attach it to the struct xfs_mount so it canbe passed back
into the directory code appropriately rather than using the struct
xfs_mount.
