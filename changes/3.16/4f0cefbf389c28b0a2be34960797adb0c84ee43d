nfsd4: more precise nfsd4_max_reply

It will turn out to be useful to have a more accurate estimate of reply
size; so, piggyback on the existing op reply-size estimators.

Also move nfsd4_max_reply to nfs4proc.c to get easier access to struct
nfsd4_operation and friends.  (Thanks to Christoph Hellwig for pointing
out that simplification.)
