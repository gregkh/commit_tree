cgroup: clean up obsolete comment for parse_cgroupfs_options()

1d5be6b287c8efc87 ("cgroup: move module ref handling into
rebind_subsystems()") makes parse_cgroupfs_options() no longer takes
refcounts on subsystems.

And unified hierachy makes parse_cgroupfs_options not need to call
with cgroup_mutex held to protect the cgroup_subsys[].

So this patch removes BUG_ON() and the comment.  As the comment
doesn't contain useful information afterwards, the whole comment is
removed.
