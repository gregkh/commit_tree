MIPS: CPC: provide locking functions

This patch provides functions to lock & unlock access to the
"core-other" register region of the CPC. Without performing appropriate
locking it is possible for code using this region to be preempted or to
race with code on another VPE within the same core, with one changing
the core which the "core-other" region is acting upon at an inopportune
time for the other.
