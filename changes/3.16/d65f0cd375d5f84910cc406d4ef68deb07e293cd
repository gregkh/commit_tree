sparc32: fix sparse warnings in leon_pci_grpci1.c

Fix following warnings:
leon_pci_grpci1.c:104:5: warning: symbol 'grpci1_map_irq' was not declared. Should it be static?
leon_pci_grpci1.c:420:6: warning: symbol 'grpci1_hw_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
+ a lot of these:
leon_pci_grpci1.c:693:18: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)

Added missing static to definitions.
Added __iomem annotations
