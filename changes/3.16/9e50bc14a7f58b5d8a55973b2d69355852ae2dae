ACPI / battery: Accelerate battery resume callback

Most time of battery resume callback is spent on executing AML code
_BTP, _BIF and _BIF to get battery info, status and set alarm. These
AML methods may access EC operation regions several times and consumes
time.

These operations are not necessary during devices resume and can run
during POST_SUSPEND/HIBERNATION event when all processes are thawed.

This also can avoid removing and adding battery sysfs nodes every system
resume even if the battery unit is not actually changed. The original code
updates sysfs nodes without check and this seems not reasonable.
