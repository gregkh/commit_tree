tools/vm/page-types.c: catch sigbus if raced with truncate

Recently added page-cache dumping is known to be a little bit racy.
But after race with truncate it just dies due to unhandled SIGBUS
when it tries to poke pages beyond the new end of file.
This patch adds handler for SIGBUS which skips the rest of the file.
