MIPS: allow GIC clockevent device config from other CPUs

This patch allows the GIC clockevent device for a CPU to be configured
by another CPU. This makes GIC clockevent devices suitable for use as
the tick broadcast device, where formerly the GIC timer local to the
configuring CPU would have been configured incorrectly.
