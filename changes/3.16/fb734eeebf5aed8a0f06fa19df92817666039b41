powerpc/mpc85xx:Add initial device tree support of T104x

The QorIQ T1040/T1042 processor support four integrated 64-bit e5500 PA
processor cores with high-performance data path acceleration architecture
and network peripheral interfaces required for networking & telecommunications.

T1042 personality is a reduced personality of T1040 without Integrated 8-port
Gigabit Ethernet switch.

The T1040/T1042 SoC includes the following function and features:

 - Four e5500 cores, each with a private 256 KB L2 cache
 - 256 KB shared L3 CoreNet platform cache (CPC)
 - Interconnect CoreNet platform
 - 32-/64-bit DDR3L/DDR4 SDRAM memory controller with ECC and interleaving
   support
 - Data Path Acceleration Architecture (DPAA) incorporating acceleration
 for the following functions:
    -  Packet parsing, classification, and distribution
    -  Queue management for scheduling, packet sequencing, and congestion
    	management
    -  Cryptography Acceleration (SEC 5.0)
    - RegEx Pattern Matching Acceleration (PME 2.2)
    - IEEE Std 1588 support
    - Hardware buffer management for buffer allocation and deallocation
 - Ethernet interfaces
    - Integrated 8-port Gigabit Ethernet switch (T1040 only)
    - Four 1 Gbps Ethernet controllers
 - Two RGMII interfaces or one RGMII and one MII interfaces
 - High speed peripheral interfaces
   - Four PCI Express 2.0 controllers running at up to 5 GHz
   - Two SATA controllers supporting 1.5 and 3.0 Gb/s operation
   - Upto two QSGMII interface
   - Upto six SGMII interface supporting 1000 Mbps
   - One SGMII interface supporting upto 2500 Mbps
 - Additional peripheral interfaces
   - Two USB 2.0 controllers with integrated PHY
   - SD/eSDHC/eMMC
   -  eSPI controller
   - Four I2C controllers
   - Four UARTs
   - Four GPIO controllers
   - Integrated flash controller (IFC)
   - Change this to  LCD/ HDMI interface (DIU) with 12 bit dual data rate
   - TDM interface
 - Multicore programmable interrupt controller (PIC)
 - Two 8-channel DMA engines
 - Single source clocking implementation
 - Deep Sleep power implementaion (wakeup from GPIO/Timer/Ethernet/USB)
