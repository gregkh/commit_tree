ext4: fix block bitmap initialization under sparse_super2

The ext4_bg_has_super() function doesn't know about the new rules for
where backup superblocks go on a sparse_super2 filesystem.  Therefore,
block bitmap initialization doesn't know that it shouldn't reserve
space for backups in groups that are never going to contain backups.
The result of this is e2fsck complaining about the block bitmap being
incorrect (fortunately not in a way that results in cross-linked
files), so fix the whole thing.
