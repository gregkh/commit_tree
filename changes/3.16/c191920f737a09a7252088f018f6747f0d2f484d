x86/vdso, build: Make LE access macros clearer, host-safe

Make it a little clearer what the littleendian access macros in
vdso2c.[ch] actually do.  This way they can probably also be moved to
a central location (e.g. tools/include) for the benefit of other host
tools.

We should avoid implementation namespace symbols when writing code
that is compiling for the compiler host, so avoid names starting with
double underscore or underscore-capital.
