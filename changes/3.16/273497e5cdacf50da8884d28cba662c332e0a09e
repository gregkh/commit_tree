drm/i915: s/i915_hw_context/intel_context

Up until now, contexts had one (and only one) backing object that was
used by the hardware to save/restore render ring contexts (via the
MI_SET_CONTEXT command). Other rings did not have or need this, so
our i915_hw_context struct had a 1:1 relationship with a a real HW
context.

With Logical Ring Contexts and Execlists, this is not possible anymore:
all rings need a backing object, and it cannot be reused. To prepare
for that, rename our contexts to the more generic term intel_context.

No functional changes.
