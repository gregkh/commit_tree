bus: mvebu: pass the coherency availability information at init time

Until now, the mvebu-mbus was guessing by itself whether hardware I/O
coherency was available or not by poking into the Device Tree to see
if the coherency fabric Device Tree node was present or not.

However, on some upcoming SoCs, the presence or absence of the
coherency fabric DT node isn't sufficient: in CONFIG_SMP, the
coherency can be enabled, but not in !CONFIG_SMP.

In order to clean this up, the mvebu_mbus_dt_init() function is
extended to get a boolean argument telling whether coherency is
enabled or not. Therefore, the logic to decide whether coherency is
available or not now belongs to the core SoC code instead of the
mvebu-mbus driver itself, which is much better.
