be2net: fix line wrap and function call indentation in be_ethtool.c

When a funtion definition or a function call spans more than one
line, ensure that the first argument on the subsequent lines is
aligned to the first column after the opening paranthesis of the
function call.

Also removes unnecessary line wrap.
