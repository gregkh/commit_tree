usb: block suspension of superspeed port while hispeed peer is active

ClearPortFeature(PORT_POWER) on a usb3 port places the port in either a
DSPORT.Powered-off-detect / DSPORT.Powered-off-reset loop, or the
DSPORT.Powered-off state.  There is no way to ensure that RX
terminations will persist in this state, so it is possible a device will
degrade to its usb2 connection.  Prevent this by blocking power-off of a
usb3 port while its usb2 peer is active, and powering on a usb3 port
before its usb2 peer.

By default the latency between peer power-on events is 0.  In order for
the device to not see usb2 active while usb3 is still powering up inject
the hub recommended power_on_good delay.  In support of satisfying the
power_on_good delay outside of hub_power_on() refactor the places where
the delay is consumed to call a new hub_power_on_good_delay() helper.

Finally, because this introduces several new checks for whether a port
is_superspeed, cache that disctinction at port creation so that we don't
need to keep looking up the parent hub device.
