ideapad-laptop: Blacklist rfkill control on the Lenovo Yoga 2 11

The Lenovo Yoga 2 11 always reports everything as blocked, causing userspace
to not even try to use the wlan / bluetooth even though they work fine.

Note this patch also removes the "else priv->rfk[i] = NULL;" bit of the
rfkill initialization, it is not necessary as the priv struct is allocated
with kzalloc.
