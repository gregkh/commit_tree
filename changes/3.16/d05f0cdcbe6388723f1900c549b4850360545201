mm: fix crashes from mbind() merging vmas

In v2.6.34 commit 9d8cebd4bcd7 ("mm: fix mbind vma merge problem")
introduced vma merging to mbind(), but it should have also changed the
convention of passing start vma from queue_pages_range() (formerly
check_range()) to new_vma_page(): vma merging may have already freed
that structure, resulting in BUG at mm/mempolicy.c:1738 and probably
worse crashes.
