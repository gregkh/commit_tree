Bluetooth: Fix properly ignoring LTKs of unknown types

In case there are new LTK types in the future we shouldn't just blindly
assume that != MGMT_LTK_UNAUTHENTICATED means that the key is
authenticated. This patch adds explicit checks for each allowed key type
in the form of a switch statement and skips any key which has an unknown
value.
