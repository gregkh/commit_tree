net: netfilter: LLVMLinux: vlais-netfilter

Replaced non-standard C use of Variable Length Arrays In Structs (VLAIS) in
xt_repldata.h with a C99 compliant flexible array member and then calculated
offsets to the other struct members. These other members aren't referenced by
name in this code, however this patch maintains the same memory layout and
padding as was previously accomplished using VLAIS.

Had the original structure been ordered differently, with the entries VLA at
the end, then it could have been a flexible member, and this patch would have
been a lot simpler. However since the data stored in this structure is
ultimately exported to userspace, the order of this structure can't be changed.

This patch makes no attempt to change the existing behavior, merely the way in
which the current layout is accomplished using standard C99 constructs. As such
the code can now be compiled with either gcc or clang.

This version of the patch removes the trailing alignment that the VLAIS
structure would allocate in order to simplify the patch.
