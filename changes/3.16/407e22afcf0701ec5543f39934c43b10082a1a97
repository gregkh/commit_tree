ACPICA: OSL: Add configurability for error message functions.

This patch extends ACPI_HW_DEPENDENT_x mechanism to all error message
related functions so that the OSPMs can have full control to configure them
into stub functions.

This patch doesn't include code for Linux to use this new mechanism, thus
no functional change.  Lv Zheng.
