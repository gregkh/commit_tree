locking/spinlocks/mcs: Rename optimistic_spin_queue() to optimistic_spin_node()

Currently, the per-cpu nodes structure for the cancellable MCS spinlock is
named "optimistic_spin_queue". However, in a follow up patch in the series
we will be introducing a new structure that serves as the new "handle" for
the lock. It would make more sense if that structure is named
"optimistic_spin_queue". Additionally, since the current use of the
"optimistic_spin_queue" structure are  "nodes", it might be better if we
rename them to "node" anyway.

This preparatory patch renames all current "optimistic_spin_queue"
to "optimistic_spin_node".
