cpumask: Utility function to set n'th cpu - local cpu first

This function sets the n'th cpu - local cpu's first.
For example: in a 16 cores server with even cpu's local, will get the
following values:
cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(0, numa, cpumask) => cpu 0 is set
cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(1, numa, cpumask) => cpu 2 is set
...
cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(7, numa, cpumask) => cpu 14 is set
cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(8, numa, cpumask) => cpu 1 is set
cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(9, numa, cpumask) => cpu 3 is set
...
cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(15, numa, cpumask) => cpu 15 is set

Curently this function will be used by multi queue networking devices to
calculate the irq affinity mask, such that as many local cpu's as
possible will be utilized to handle the mq device irq's.
