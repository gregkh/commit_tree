arm64: ptrace: change fs when passing kernel pointer to regset code

Our compat PTRACE_POKEUSR implementation simply passes the user data to
regset_copy_from_user after some simple range checking. Unfortunately,
the data in question has already been copied to the kernel stack by this
point, so the subsequent access_ok check fails and the ptrace request
returns -EFAULT. This causes problems tracing fork() with older versions
of strace.

This patch briefly changes the fs to KERNEL_DS, so that the access_ok
check passes even with a kernel address.
