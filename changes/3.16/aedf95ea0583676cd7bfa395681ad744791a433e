mm/memblock.c: call kmemleak directly from memblock_(alloc|free)

Kmemleak could ignore memory blocks allocated via memblock_alloc()
leading to false positives during scanning.  This patch adds the
corresponding callbacks and removes kmemleak_free_* calls in
mm/nobootmem.c to avoid duplication.

The kmemleak_alloc() in mm/nobootmem.c is kept since
__alloc_memory_core_early() does not use memblock_alloc() directly.
