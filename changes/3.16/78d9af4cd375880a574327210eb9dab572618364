uprobes/x86: Cleanup the usage of arch_uprobe->def.fixups, make it u8

handle_riprel_insn() assumes that nobody else could modify ->fixups
before. This is correct but fragile, change it to use "|=".

Also make ->fixups u8, we are going to add the new members into the
union. It is not clear why UPROBE_FIX_RIP_.X lived in the upper byte,
redefine them so that they can fit into u8.
