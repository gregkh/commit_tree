IBM Currituck: Clean up board specific code before adding Akebono code

The IBM Akebono code uses the same initialisation functions as the
earlier Currituck board. Rather than create a copy of this code for
Akebono we will instead integrate support for it into the same file as
the Currituck code.

This patch just renames the board support file and updates the Makefile.
