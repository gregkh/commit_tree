i2c: imx: add SMBus block read support

The smbus block read is not currently supported for imx i2c devices.
This patchset adds the support to imx i2c bus so that blocks of data
can be read using SMbus block reads.(using i2c_smbus_read_block_data()
function from the i2c_core.c.). Tested with 3.10.9 kernel.
