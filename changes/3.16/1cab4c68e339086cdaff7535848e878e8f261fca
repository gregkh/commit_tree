USB: option: add device ID for SpeedUp SU9800 usb 3g modem

Reported by Alif Mubarak Ahmad:

This device vendor and product id is 1c9e:9800
It is working as serial interface with generic usbserial driver.
I thought it is more suitable to use usbserial option driver, which has
better capability distinguishing between modem serial interface and
micro sd storage interface.
