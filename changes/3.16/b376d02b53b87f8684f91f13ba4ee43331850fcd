ARM/ARM64: KVM: Emulate PSCI v0.2 CPU_SUSPEND

This patch adds emulation of PSCI v0.2 CPU_SUSPEND function call for
KVM ARM/ARM64. This is a CPU-level function call which can suspend
current CPU or current CPU cluster. We don't have VCPU clusters in
KVM so we only suspend the current VCPU.

The CPU_SUSPEND emulation is not tested much because currently there
is no CPUIDLE driver in Linux kernel that uses PSCI CPU_SUSPEND. The
PSCI CPU_SUSPEND implementation in ARM64 kernel was tested using a
Simple CPUIDLE driver which is not published due to unstable DT-bindings
for PSCI.

For simplicity, we implement CPU_SUSPEND emulation similar to WFI
(Wait-for-interrupt) emulation and we also treat power-down request
to be same as stand-by request. This is consistent with section
5.4.1 and section 5.4.2 of PSCI v0.2 specification.
