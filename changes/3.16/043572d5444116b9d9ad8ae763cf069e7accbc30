hwmon: (smsc47m192) Fix temperature limit and vrm write operations

Temperature limit clamps are applied after converting the temperature
from milli-degrees C to degrees C, so either the clamp limit needs
to be specified in degrees C, not milli-degrees C, or clamping must
happen before converting to degrees C. Use the latter method to avoid
overflows.

vrm is an u8, so the written value needs to be limited to [0, 255].
