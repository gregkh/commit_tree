block: remove WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT from kblockd

blk-mq issues async requests through kblockd. To issue a work request on
a specific CPU, kblockd_schedule_delayed_work_on is used. However, the
specific CPU choice may not be honored, if the power_efficient option
for workqueues is set. blk-mq requires that we have strict per-cpu
scheduling, so it wont work properly if kblockd is marked
POWER_EFFICIENT and power_efficient is set.

Remove the kblockd WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT flag to prevent this behavior.
This essentially reverts part of commit 695588f9454b, which added
the WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT marker to kblockd.
