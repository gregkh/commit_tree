drm: Make the vblank disable timer per-crtc

Currently there's one per-device vblank disable timer, and it gets
reset wheneven the vblank refcount for any crtc drops to zero. That
means that one crtc could accidentally be keeping the vblank interrupts
for other crtcs enabled even if there are no users for them. Make the
disable timer per-crtc to avoid this issue.
