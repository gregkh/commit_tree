hfsplus: coding style fix for declarations in hfsplus_fs.h

Some function declarations in hfsplus_fs.h were with argument names,
some without, and some were mixed.  This patch adds argument names
everywhere, sorts function in order they go in .c files, and moves
hfs_part_find() to a proper section.

Auto-formatting and sorting was done with:
cfunctions *.c | indent -linux | sed "s| \* | \*|"
