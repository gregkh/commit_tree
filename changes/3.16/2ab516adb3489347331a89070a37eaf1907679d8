ARM: dts: kirkwood: add pinctrl node to common SoC include

All Kirkwood SoCs have their pinctrl registers at the same address.
Instead of replaying the same reg property on each SoC, have the
reg property set in the common SoC file already. This also allows
us to move common pinctrl settings to this node later on.
