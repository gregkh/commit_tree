staging: rtl8821ae: deal with unused functions in halbtc8723b2ant.c

This commit fixes the compiler -Wunused-function warning. It was enough
to put #define around them to supress this warning. One was a special
case because it's usage was commented-out therefore, as I did not want
to remove it completely, I disabled it with #if 0
