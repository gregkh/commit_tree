HSI: fix omap ssi driver dependency

The SSI protocol implementation has an incorrect dependency on the OMAP_SSI
driver, which allows SSI to be built-in while the underlying OMAP_SSI
implementation is a loadable module, causing a link error.

This changes the dependency to the simpler 'depends on OMAP_SSI' that also
ensures that SSI-protocol can only be a module if OMAP_SSI is not built-in.
