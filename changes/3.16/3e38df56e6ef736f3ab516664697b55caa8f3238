evm: provide option to protect additional SMACK xattrs

Newer versions of SMACK introduced following security xattrs:
SMACK64EXEC, SMACK64TRANSMUTE and SMACK64MMAP.

To protect these xattrs, this patch includes them in the HMAC
calculation.  However, for backwards compatibility with existing
labeled filesystems, including these xattrs needs to be
configurable.

Changelog:
- Add SMACK dependency on new option (Mimi)
