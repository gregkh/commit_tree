clk: qcom: Add basic support for APQ8064 global clock controller clocks

The APQ8064 and MSM8960 share a significant amount of clock data and
code between the two SoCs.  Rather than duplicating the data we just add
support for a unqiue APQ8064 clock table into the MSM8960 code.

For now add just enough clocks to get a basic serial port going on an
APQ8064 device.
