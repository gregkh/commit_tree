metag: Remove TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG

The Meta idle function jumps into the interrupt handler which
efficiently blocks waiting for the next interrupt when it reads the
interrupt status register (TXSTATI). No other (polling) idle functions
can be used, therefore TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG is unnecessary, so lets remove
it.
