bnx2x: update MAINTAINERS for bnx2x and e-mail addresses

The bnx2x development team has transferred from Broadcom to Qlogic.
This patch updates some obsolete email addresses to usable ones.
The bnx2x files contain headers with legal information from
Broadcom. Qlogic Legal depratment is taking their time coming up
with their own legal info. So this patch only updates contact
information. I will follow up with a patch for the headers once I
have the required info.
