powerpc: 64bit sendfile is capped at 2GB

commit 8f9c0119d7ba (compat: fs: Generic compat_sys_sendfile
implementation) changed the PowerPC 64bit sendfile call from
sys_sendile64 to sys_sendfile.

Unfortunately this broke sendfile of lengths greater than 2G because
sys_sendfile caps at MAX_NON_LFS. Restore what we had previously which
fixes the bug.
