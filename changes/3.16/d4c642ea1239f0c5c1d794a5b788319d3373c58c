gianfar: Call netif_carrier_off() prior to registration

Quoting David Miller:
"At the moment you call register_netdev() the device is visible, notifications
are sent to userspace, and userland tools can try to bring the interface up
and see the incorrect link state, before you do the netif_carrier_off().

Said another way, between the register_netdev() and netif_carrier_off() call,
userspace can see the device in an inconsistent state."

So call netif_carrier_off() prior to register_netdev().
