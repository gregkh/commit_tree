tracing: Return error if ftrace_trace_arrays list is empty

ftrace_trace_arrays links global_trace.list. However, global_trace
is not added to ftrace_trace_arrays if trace_alloc_buffers() failed.
As the result, ftrace_trace_arrays becomes an empty list. If
ftrace_trace_arrays is an empty list, current top_trace_array() returns
an invalid pointer. As the result, the kernel can induce memory corruption
or panic.

Current implementation does not check whether ftrace_trace_arrays is empty
list or not. So, in this patch, if ftrace_trace_arrays is empty list,
top_trace_array() returns NULL. Moreover, this patch makes all functions
calling top_trace_array() handle it appropriately.
