cgroup: update cgroup->subsys_mask to ->child_subsys_mask and restore cgroup_root->subsys_mask

944196278d3d ("cgroup: move ->subsys_mask from cgroupfs_root to
cgroup") moved ->subsys_mask from cgroup_root to cgroup to prepare for
the unified hierarhcy; however, it turns out that carrying the
subsys_mask of the children in the parent, instead of itself, is a lot
more natural.  This patch restores cgroup_root->subsys_mask and morphs
cgroup->subsys_mask into cgroup->child_subsys_mask.

* Uses of root->cgrp.subsys_mask are restored to root->subsys_mask.

* Remove automatic setting and clearing of cgrp->subsys_mask and
  instead just inherit ->child_subsys_mask from the parent during
  cgroup creation.  Note that this doesn't affect any current
  behaviors.

* Undo __kill_css() separation.
