cfg80211: Add indoor only and GO concurrent channel attributes

The FCC are clarifying some soft configuration requirements,
which among other include the following:

1. Indoor operation, where a device can use channels requiring indoor
   operation, subject to that it can guarantee indoor operation,
   i.e., the device is connected to AC Power or the device is under
   the control of a local master that is acting as an AP and is
   connected to AC Power.
2. Concurrent GO operation, where devices may instantiate a P2P GO
   while they are under the guidance of an authorized master. For example,
   on a channel on which a BSS is connected to an authorized master, i.e.,
   with DFS and radar detection capability in the UNII band.

See https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/comments/GetPublishedDocument.html?id=327&tn=528122

Add support for advertising Indoor-only and GO-Concurrent channel
properties.
