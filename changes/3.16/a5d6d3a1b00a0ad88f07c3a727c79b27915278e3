softirq: A single rcu_bh_qs() call per softirq set is enough

Calling rcu_bh_qs() after every softirq action is not really needed.
What RCU needs is at least one rcu_bh_qs() per softirq round to note a
quiescent state was passed for rcu_bh.

Note for Paul and myself : this could be inlined as a single instruction
and avoid smp_processor_id()
(sone this_cpu_write(rcu_bh_data.passed_quiesce, 1))
