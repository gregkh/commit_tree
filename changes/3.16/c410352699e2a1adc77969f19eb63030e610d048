MIPS: math-emu: Add IEEE754 exception statistics to debugfs

Sometimes it's useful to let the user, while doing performance research,
know what in the IEEE754 exceptions has caused many times of FP emulation
when running a specific application. This patch adds 5 more files to
/sys/kernel/debug/mips/fpuemustats/, whose filenames begin with "ieee754".
These stats are in addition to the existing cp1ops, cp1xops, errors, loads
and stores, which may not be useful in understanding the reasons of ieee754
exceptions.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Fixed reject due to other changes to the kernel
FP assist software.]
