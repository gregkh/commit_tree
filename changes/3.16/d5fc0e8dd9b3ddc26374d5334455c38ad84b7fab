ARM: davinci: Remove redundant/unused parameters for edma

The following parameters are no longer needed by the edma driver since the
information can be obtained from the IP's CCCFG register:
n_channel, n_region, n_slot and n_tc.
Remove the initialization of n_cc as well since in this context it has no
meaning. We have separate edma_soc_info struct/eDMA3_CC instance so this
member does not make any sense (and the driver no longer uses it).
