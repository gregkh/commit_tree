ARM: dts: Enable mcpdm and mcbsp1 on DuoVero

Since commit 7adb0933b18debef3 (ARM: dts: omap4: Set all audio related
IP's status to disabled as default) all audio related device are
disabled by default. Most boards were updated to enable devices
explicitly, but DuoVero was missed.

mcpdm is used for twl6040 and mcbsp1 is used for BlueTooth audio.
