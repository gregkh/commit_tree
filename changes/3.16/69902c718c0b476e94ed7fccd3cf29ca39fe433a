kprobes: Ensure blacklist data is aligned

ARC Linux (not supporting native unaligned access) was failing
to boot because __start_kprobe_blacklist was not aligned.

This was because per generated vmlinux.lds it was emitted right
next to .rodata with strings etc hence could be randomly
unaligned.

Fix that by ensuring a word alignment. While 4 would suffice for
32bit arches and problem at hand, it is probably better to put 8.
