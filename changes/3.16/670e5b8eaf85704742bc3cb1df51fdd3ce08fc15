net: Add support for device specific address syncing

This change provides a function to be used in order to break the
ndo_set_rx_mode call into a set of address add and remove calls.  The code
is based on the implementation of dev_uc_sync/dev_mc_sync.  Since they
essentially do the same thing but with only one dev I simply named my
functions __dev_uc_sync/__dev_mc_sync.

I also implemented an unsync version of the functions as well to allow for
cleanup on close.
