rtl8180: change module name in rtl818x_pci

rtl8180 driver can handle also rtl8185 and rtl8187SE cards,
however in userspace tools (network manager) it still appares
as "rtl8180".
This might lead the user to think the wrong driver is in use.

This patch changes module name to "rtl818x_pci" that should be
more explanatory.
