thermal: armada: Rename armada_thermal_ops struct

As preparation work to add a generic infrastructure to support
different SoC variants, the armada_thermal_ops will be used
to host the SoC-specific fields, such as formula values and
register shifts.

For this reason, the name armada_thermal_ops is no longer suitable,
and this commit replaces it with armada_thermal_data.
