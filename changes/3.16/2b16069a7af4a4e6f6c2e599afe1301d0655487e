spi/topcliff-pch: Fix Kconfig dependencies

The spi-topcliff-pch driver is for a companion chip to the Intel Atom
E600 series processors. These are 32-bit x86 processors so the driver
is only needed on X86_32. Add COMPILE_TEST as an alternative, so that
the driver can still be build-tested elsewhere.
