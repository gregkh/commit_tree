drm/i915/bdw: Implement a basic PM interrupt handler

Almost all of it is reusable from the existing code. The primary
difference is we need to do even less in the interrupt handler, since
interrupts are not shared in the same way.

The patch is mostly a copy-paste of the existing snb+ code, with updates
to the relevant parts requiring changes to the interrupt handling. As
such it /should/ be relatively trivial. It's highly likely that I missed
some places where I need a gen8 version of the PM interrupts, but it has
become invisible to me by now.

This patch could probably be split into adding the new functions,
followed by actually handling the interrupts. Since the code is
currently disabled (and broken) I think the patch stands better by
itself.

v2: Move the commit about not touching the ringbuffer interrupt to the
snb_* function where it belongs (Rodrigo)

v3: Rebased on Paulo's runtime PM changes

v4: Not well validated, but rebase on
