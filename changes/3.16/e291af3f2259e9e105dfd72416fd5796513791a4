drm/nouveau/disp/nv04-nv40: abort scanoutpos query on vga analog.

nv04_disp_scanoutpos() must abort to trigger simple timestamping
fallback if vtotal/htotal regs return zero. This happens if the
output isn't a digital output, but a vga analog output, as the
regs don't get initialized in that case.

Fixes timestamping failure on nv-40 and earlier with vga output.
