drbd: don't let application IO pre-empt resync too often

Before, application IO could pre-empt resync activity
for up to hardcoded 20 seconds per resync request.
A very busy server could throttle the effective resync bandwidth
down to one request per 20 seconds.

Now, we only let application IO pre-empt resync traffic
while the current resync rate estimate is above c-min-rate.

If you disable the c-min-rate throttle feature (set c-min-rate = 0),
application IO will no longer pre-empt resync traffic at all.
