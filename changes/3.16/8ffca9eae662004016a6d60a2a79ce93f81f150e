staging: r8712u: Remove useless return variables

This patch remove variables that are initialized with a constant,
are never updated, and are only used as parameter of return.
Return the constant instead of using a variable.

Verified by compilation only.

The coccinelle script that find and fixes this issue is:
// <smpl>
@@
type T;
constant C;
identifier ret;
@@
- T ret = C;
... when != ret
- return ret;
+ return C;
// </smpl>
