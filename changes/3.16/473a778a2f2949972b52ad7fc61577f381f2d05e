tools lib traceevent: Added support for __get_bitmask() macro

Coming in v3.16, trace events will be able to save bitmasks in raw
format in the ring buffer and output it with the __get_bitmask() macro.

In order for userspace tools to parse this, it must be able to handle
the __get_bitmask() call and be able to convert the data that's in
the ring buffer into a nice bitmask format. The output is similar to
what the kernel uses to print bitmasks, with a comma separator every
4 bytes (8 characters).

This allows for cpumasks to also be saved efficiently.

The first user is the thermal:thermal_power_limit event which has the
following output:

 thermal_power_limit:  cpus=0000000f freq=1900000 cdev_state=0 power=5252
