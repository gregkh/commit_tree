ocfs2: fix incorrect i_size of global bitmap inode after resize

Ocfs2 cluster size may be 1MB, which has 20 bits.  When resize, the
input new clusters is mostly the number of clusters in a group
descriptor(32256).

Since the input clusters is defined as type int, so it will overflow
when shift left 20 bits and then lead to incorrect global bitmap i_size.
