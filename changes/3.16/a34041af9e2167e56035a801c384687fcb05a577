staging/lustre/ptlrpc: Fix assertion failure of null_alloc_rs()

lustre_get_emerg_rs() set the size of the reply buffer to zero
by mistake, which will cause LBUG in null_alloc_rs() when memory
pressure is high. This patch fix this problem and adds a size
check to avoid the problem of insufficient buffer size.
