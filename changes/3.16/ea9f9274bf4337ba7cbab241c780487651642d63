x86/xen: no need to explicitly register an NMI callback

Remove xen_enable_nmi() to fix a 64-bit guest crash when registering
the NMI callback on Xen 3.1 and earlier.

It's not needed since the NMI callback is set by a set_trap_table
hypercall (in xen_load_idt() or xen_write_idt_entry()).

It's also broken since it only set the current VCPU's callback.
