ASoC: Intel: Only export one Baytrail DAI

We don't need more than one DAI for Baytrail SST. Usage becomes also more
straightforward by grouping playback and capture streams under the same PCM
device.

[Jarkko: I made Liam's sst-baytrail-pcm.c change a few lines smaller and
squashed together with my byt-rt5640.c change]
