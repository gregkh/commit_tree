spi/pxa2xx: fix runtime PM enabling order

In commit 7dd62787334ac6e0e2a0ef3f20bb1936ac431b04 (spi/pxa2xx: Convert
to core runtime PM) master->auto_runtime_pm was set to true.

In this case pm_runtime_enable() must be called *before*
spi_register_master(), otherwise the kernel hangs with this error
message:

  spi_master spi0: Failed to power device: -13

A similar fix, but for spi/hspi, was applied in
268d76430d1b68c340687357ffd18b4b12d02269.
