xen-netfront: Add support for multiple queues

Build on the refactoring of the previous patch to implement multiple
queues between xen-netfront and xen-netback.

Check XenStore for multi-queue support, and set up the rings and event
channels accordingly.

Write ring references and event channels to XenStore in a queue
hierarchy if appropriate, or flat when using only one queue.

Update the xennet_select_queue() function to choose the queue on which
to transmit a packet based on the skb hash result.
