drivers/rtc/rtc-omap.c: remove multiple device id checks

Remove multiple superfluous device id checks.  Since an id_table is
present in the driver probe() should never encounter an empty device id
entry.  In case of OF style match, of_match_device() returns an matching
entry.

For paranoia sake, check for device id entry once and fail probe() if none
is found.  This is much better than checking for it multiple times.
