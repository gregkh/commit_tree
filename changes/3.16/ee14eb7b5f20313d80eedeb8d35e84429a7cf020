skge: Added FS A8NE-FM to the list of 32bit DMA boards

Added FUJITSU SIEMENS A8NE-FM to the list of 32bit DMA boards

>From Tomi O.:
After I added an entry to this MB into the skge.c
driver in order to enable the mentioned 64bit dma disable quirk,
the network data corruptions ended and everything is fine again.
