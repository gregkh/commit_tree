drbd: allow parallel promote/demote actions

We plan to use genl_family->parallel_ops = true in the future,
but need to review all possible interactions first.

For now, only selectively drop genl_lock() in drbd_set_role(),
instead serializing on our own internal resource->conf_update mutex.

We now can be promoted/demoted on many resources in parallel,
which may significantly improve cluster failover times
when fencing is required.
