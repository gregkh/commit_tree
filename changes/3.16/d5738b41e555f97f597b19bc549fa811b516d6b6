Revert "wl1251: enforce changed hw encryption support on monitor state change"

This reverts commit b90a1165a72fabdc260abaa9eeadcbfd29e267eb.

That commit (or rather, hack) triggers a scary WARN in IBSS (ad-hoc) mode.
Steps to reproduce:
    ifconfig wlan0 down
    iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc
    ifconfig wlan0 up

...
This happens because ieee80211_connection_loss() is not expected to be
called in IBSS mode (mac80211 ends up queuing uninitialized work
in that case).
