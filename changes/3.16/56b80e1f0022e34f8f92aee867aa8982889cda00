drm/i915: Check for FIFO underruns at the end of modeset on gmch

FIFO underruns don't generate interrupts on gmch platforms, so
if we want to know whether a modeset triggered FIFO underruns we
need to explicitly check for them.

As a modeset on one pipe could cause underruns on other pipes,
check for underruns on all pipes.
