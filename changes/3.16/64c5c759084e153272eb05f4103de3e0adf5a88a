of/irq: provide more wrappers for !CONFIG_OF

The pci-rcar driver is enabled for compile tests, and this has
now shown that the driver cannot build without CONFIG_OF,
following the inclusion of f8f2fe7355fb "PCI: rcar: Use new OF
interrupt mapping when possible":

drivers/built-in.o: In function `rcar_pci_map_irq':
:(.text+0x1cc7c): undefined reference to `of_irq_parse_and_map_pci'
pci/host/pcie-rcar.c: In function 'pci_dma_range_parser_init':
pci/host/pcie-rcar.c:875:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'of_n_addr_cells' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

As pointed out by Ben Dooks and Geert Uytterhoeven, this is actually
supposed to build fine, which we can achieve if we make the
declaration of of_irq_parse_and_map_pci conditional on CONFIG_OF
and provide an empty inline function otherwise, as we do for
a lot of other of interfaces.

This lets us build the rcar_pci driver again without CONFIG_OF
for build testing. All platforms using this driver select OF,
so this doesn't change anything for the users.

low-level functions that should not be used for !OF]
