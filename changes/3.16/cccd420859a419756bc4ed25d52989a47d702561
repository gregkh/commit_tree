ACPI / scan: always register memory hotplug scan handler

Prevent platform devices from being created for ACPI memory device
objects if CONFIG_ACPI_HOTPLUG_MEMORY is unset by compiling out the
memory hotplug scan handler's callbacks only in that case and still
compiling its device ID list in and registering the scan handler in
either case.

Also unset the memory hotplug scan handler's .attach() callback
if acpi_no_memhotplug is set, but still register the scan handler to
avoid creating platform devices for ACPI memory devices in that case
too.

This change is based on a prototype from Zhang Rui.
