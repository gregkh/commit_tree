xen/blkback: disable discard feature if requested by toolstack

Newer toolstacks may provide a boolean property "discard-enable" in the
backend node. Its purpose is to disable discard for file backed storage
to avoid fragmentation. Recognize this setting also for physical
storage.  If that property exists and is false, do not advertise
"feature-discard" to the frontend.
