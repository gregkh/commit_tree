nfs: nfs_page should take a ref on the head req

nfs_pages that aren't the the head of a group must take a reference on the
head as long as ->wb_head is set to it. This stops the head from hitting
a refcount of 0 while there is still an active nfs_page for the page group.

This avoids kref warnings in the writeback code when the page group head
is found and referenced.
