ARM: 8069/1: Make thread_save_fp macro aware of THUMB2 mode

The thread_save_fp macro has been defined so that it always reads the fp member
of the cpu_context_save struct. However, in the case of THUMB2 the fp is saved
not in the fp (r11) member but rather in r7.

This patch changes the way the macro is defined such that FP is read from the
correct place depending on whether we are a THUMB2 kernel or not. This enables
the backtrace in sitaution such as "echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger" or the
function in which a process sleeping when "ps -Al" is invoked.
