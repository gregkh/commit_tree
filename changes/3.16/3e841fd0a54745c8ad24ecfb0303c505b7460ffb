ath10k: fix htt rx ring clean up

msdu_payId was read before txrx tasklet was killed
so it was possible to end up using an invalid
sk_buff pointer leading to a panic.

Make sure to sanitize rx ring sk_buff pointers and
make the clean up go through all possible entries
and not rely on coherent-DMA mapped u32 index
which could be (in theory) corrupted by the device
as well.
