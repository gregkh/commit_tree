KVM: s390: Add a function for checking the low-address protection

The s390 architecture has a special protection mechanism that can
be used to prevent write access to the vital data in the low-core
memory area. This patch adds a new helper function that can be used
to check for such write accesses and in case of protection, it also
sets up the exception data accordingly.
