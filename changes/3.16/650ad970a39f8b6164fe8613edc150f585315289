drm/i915: vlv: factor out vlv_force_gfx_clock and check for pending force-off

This will be needed by the VLV runtime PM helpers too, so factor it out.

Also add a safety check for the case where the previous force-off is
still pending, since I'm not sure if Punit can handle a new setting
while the previous one hasn't settled yet.

v2:
- unchanged
v3:
- add a note to the commit message about the safety check (Ville)
