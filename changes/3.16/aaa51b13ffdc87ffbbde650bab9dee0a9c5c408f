drm/exynos: dpi: Fix NULL pointer dereference with legacy bindings

If there is no panel node in DT and instead display timings are provided
directly in FIMD node, there is no panel object created and ctx->panel
becomes NULL. However during Exynos DRM initialization
drm_helper_hpd_irq_event() is called, which in turns calls
exynos_dpi_detect(), which dereferences ctx->panel without a check,
causing a NULL pointer derefrence.

This patch fixes the issue by adding necessary NULL pointer check.
