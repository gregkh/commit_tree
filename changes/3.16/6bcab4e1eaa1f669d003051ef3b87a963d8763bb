perf tools: Clarify the output of perf sched map.

In output of perf sched map, any shortname of thread will be explained
at the first time when it appear.

Example:
              *A0       228836.978985 secs A0 => perf:23032
          *.   A0       228836.979016 secs B0 => swapper:0
           .  *C0       228836.979099 secs C0 => migration/3:22
  *A0      .   C0       228836.979115 secs
   A0      .  *.        228836.979115 secs

But B0, which is explained as swapper:0 did not appear in the
left part of output. Instead, we use '.' as the shortname of
swapper:0. So the comment of "B0 => swapper:0" is not easy to
understand.

This patch clarify the output of perf sched map with not allocating
one letter-number shortname for swapper:0 and print ". => swapper:0"
as the explanation for swapper:0.

Example:
              *A0       228836.978985 secs A0 => perf:23032
          * .  A0       228836.979016 secs .  => swapper:0
            . *B0       228836.979099 secs B0 => migration/3:22
  *A0       .  B0       228836.979115 secs
   A0       . * .       228836.979115 secs
   A0     *C0   .       228836.979225 secs C0 => ksoftirqd/2:18
   A0     *D0   .       228836.979236 secs D0 => rcu_sched:7
