ARM: tegra: define Jetson TK1 regulators

These are mostly identical to the Venice2 regulator definitions, since
the board designs are very similar. Differences are:

- Jetson TK1 doesn't have a built-in LCD panel, so on-board regulators
  are not present for the backlight, touchscreen, or panel.
- +3.3V_RUN needs to be boot-on/always-on, since it's widely used. This
  change should likely be propagated to Venice2 for completeness,
  although it will have no practical effect there since various other
  regulators use +3.3V_RUN as their supply and are always-on.
- +3.3V_LP0 needs to be boot-on as well as always-on. One reason
  is because it's used to driver the UART level-shifter; without this, I
  see a brief period of UART corruption during cold boots.I suspect this
  change needs to be propagated to Venice2, and we simply haven't noticed
  the need since there's no UART level-shifter on Venice2.
- A few rails have different names in the schematics.
