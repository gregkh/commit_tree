perf probe: Improve an error message of perf probe --vars mode

Fix an error message when failed to find given address in --vars
mode.

Without this fix, perf probe -V doesn't show the final "Error"
message if it fails to find given source line. Moreover, it
tells it fails to find "variables" instead of the source line.
  -----
  # perf probe -V foo@bar
  Failed to find variables at foo@bar (0)
  -----
The result also shows mysterious error code. Actually the error
returns 0 or -ENOENT means that it just fails to find the address
of given source line. (0 means there is no matching address,
and -ENOENT means there is an entry(DIE) but it has no instance,
e.g. an empty inlined function)

This fixes it to show what happened and the final error message
as below.
  -----
  # perf probe -V foo@bar
  Failed to find the address of foo@bar
    Error: Failed to show vars.
