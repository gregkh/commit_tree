drm/irq: simplify irq checks in drm_wait_vblank

Checking for both an irq number _and_ whether it's enabled is
redundant. Originally I've thought the drm_dev_to_irq call would break
drivers which do their own irq checking, but those shouldn't have
DRIVER_HAVE_IRQ set as Thierry Reding pointed out. But such drivers
already need to set dev->irq_enabled for other reasons, so we might as
well ditch that check, too.

v2: Also drop the HAVE_IRQ check.
