sl[au]b: charge slabs to kmemcg explicitly

We have only a few places where we actually want to charge kmem so
instead of intruding into the general page allocation path with
__GFP_KMEMCG it's better to explictly charge kmem there.  All kmem
charges will be easier to follow that way.

This is a step towards removing __GFP_KMEMCG.  It removes __GFP_KMEMCG
from memcg caches' allocflags.  Instead it makes slab allocation path
call memcg_charge_kmem directly getting memcg to charge from the cache's
memcg params.

This also eliminates any possibility of misaccounting an allocation
going from one memcg's cache to another memcg, because now we always
charge slabs against the memcg the cache belongs to.  That's why this
patch removes the big comment to memcg_kmem_get_cache.
