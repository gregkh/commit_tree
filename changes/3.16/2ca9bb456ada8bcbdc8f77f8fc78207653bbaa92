sysctl: refactor sysctl string writing logic

Consolidate buffer length checking with new-line/end-of-line checking.
Additionally, instead of reading user memory twice, just do the
assignment during the loop.

This change doesn't affect the potential races here.  It was already
possible to read a sysctl that was in the middle of a write.  In both
cases, the string will always be NULL terminated.  The pre-existing race
remains a problem to be solved.
