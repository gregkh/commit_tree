extcon: max14577: Choose muic_irqs according to device type

This patch continues the preparation for adding support for max77836
device to existing max14577 driver.

During probe choose muic_irqs according to device type. Currently there
are only "max14577_muic_irqs" but later patch will add max77836
interrupts.
