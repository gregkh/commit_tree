sysrq,rcu: suppress RCU stall warnings while sysrq runs

Some sysrq handlers can run for a long time, because they dump a lot of
data onto a serial console.  Having RCU stall warnings pop up in the
middle of them only makes the problem worse.

This patch temporarily disables RCU stall warnings while a sysrq request
is handled.
