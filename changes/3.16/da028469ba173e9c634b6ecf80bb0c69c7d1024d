workqueue: separate iteration role from worker_idr

worker_idr has the iteration (iterating for attached workers) and
worker ID duties. These two duties don't have to be tied together. We
can separate them and use a list for tracking attached workers and
iteration.

Before this separation, it wasn't possible to add rescuer workers to
worker_idr due to rescuer workers couldn't allocate ID dynamically
because ID-allocation depends on memory-allocation, which rescuer
can't depend on.

After separation, we can easily add the rescuer workers to the list for
iteration without any memory-allocation. It is required when we attach
the rescuer worker to the pool in later patch.
