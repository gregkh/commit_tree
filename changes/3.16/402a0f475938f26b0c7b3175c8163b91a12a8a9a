btrfs: usage error should not be logged into system log

I have an opinion that system logs /var/log/messages are
valuable info to investigate the real system issues at
the data center. People handling data center issues
do spend a lot time and efforts analyzing messages
files. Having usage error logged into /var/log/messages
is something we should avoid.
