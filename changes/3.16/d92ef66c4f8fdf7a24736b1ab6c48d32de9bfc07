x86: make dma_alloc_coherent() return zeroed memory if CMA is enabled

This patchset enhances the DMA Contiguous Memory Allocator on x86.

Currently the DMA CMA is only supported with pci-nommu dma_map_ops and
furthermore it can't be enabled on x86_64.  But I would like to allocate
big contiguous memory with dma_alloc_coherent() and tell it to the device
that requires it, regardless of which dma mapping implementation is
actually used in the system.

So this makes it work with swiotlb and intel-iommu dma_map_ops, too.  And
this also extends "cma=" kernel parameter to specify placement constraint
by the physical address range of memory allocations.  For example, CMA
allocates memory below 4GB by "cma=64M@0-4G", it is required for the
devices only supporting 32-bit addressing on 64-bit systems without iommu.

This patch (of 5):

Calling dma_alloc_coherent() with __GFP_ZERO must return zeroed memory.

But when the contiguous memory allocator (CMA) is enabled on x86 and the
memory region is allocated by dma_alloc_from_contiguous(), it doesn't
return zeroed memory.  Because dma_generic_alloc_coherent() forgot to fill
the memory region with zero if it was allocated by
dma_alloc_from_contiguous()

Most implementations of dma_alloc_coherent() return zeroed memory
regardless of whether __GFP_ZERO is specified.  So this fixes it by
unconditionally zeroing the allocated memory region.

Alternatively, we could fix dma_alloc_from_contiguous() to return zeroed
out memory and remove memset() from all caller of it.  But we can't simply
remove the memset on arm because __dma_clear_buffer() is used there for
ensuring cache flushing and it is used in many places.  Of course we can
do redundant memset in dma_alloc_from_contiguous(), but I think this patch
is less impact for fixing this problem.
