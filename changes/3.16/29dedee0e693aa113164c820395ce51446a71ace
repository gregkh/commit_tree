uprobes: Add mem_cgroup_charge_anon() into uprobe_write_opcode()

Hugh says:

    The one I noticed was that it forgets all about memcg (because
    it was copied from KSM, and there the replacement page has already
    been charged to a memcg). See how mm/memory.c do_anonymous_page()
    does a mem_cgroup_charge_anon().

Hopefully not a big problem, uprobes is a system-wide thing and only
root can insert the probes. But I agree, should be fixed anyway.

Add mem_cgroup_{un,}charge_anon() into uprobe_write_opcode(). To simplify
the error handling (and avoid the new "uncharge" label) the patch also
moves anon_vma_prepare() up before we alloc/charge the new page.

While at it fix the comment about ->mmap_sem, it is held for write.
