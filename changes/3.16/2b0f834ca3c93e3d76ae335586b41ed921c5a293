m68k/atari - atari_scsi: change abort/reset return codes

[Resend of earlier patch - added equivalent changes to sun3 NCR5380 code]

The abort/reset lowlevel return codes had changed with the new
error SCSI handling - update Atari and Sun3 NCR5380 drivers to reflect this.

Change reset handling for Atari to clear queues only, do not attempt
to call done() on each command aborted by the reset. The EH code
should do that for us. Queues _must_ be cleared, otherwise
atari_scsi_bus_reset will not release the ST-DMA lock, deadlocking
further error recovery.

Update the Sun3 NCR5380 driver as well - the Sun3 driver was
derived from the Atari one. Kudos to Finn Thain for the Sun3 part
and cleaning up the header files. After the header cleanup, the
initio.h include (!) can be dropped from sun3_scsi.h now.
