Btrfs: fix transaction leak during fsync call

If btrfs_log_dentry_safe() returns an error, we set ret to 1 and
fall through with the goal of committing the transaction. However,
in the case where the inode doesn't need a full sync, we would call
btrfs_wait_ordered_range() against the target range for our inode,
and if it returned an error, we would return without commiting or
ending the transaction.
