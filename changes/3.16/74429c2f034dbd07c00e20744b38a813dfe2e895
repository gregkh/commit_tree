thermal: samsung: replace inten_ bit fields with intclr_

This patch replaces the inten_rise_shift/mask and inten_fall_shift/mask
with intclr_rise_shift/mask and intclr_fall_shift/mask respectively.
Currently, inten_rise_shift/mask and inten_fall_shift/mask bits are only used
to configure intclr related registers.

Description of H/W:
The offset for the bits in the CLEAR register are not consistent across TMU
modules in Exynso5250, 5420 and 5440.

On Exynos5250, the FALL interrupt related en, status and clear bits are
available at an offset of
16 in INTEN, INTSTAT registers and at an offset of
12 in INTCLEAR register.

On Exynos5420, the FALL interrupt related en, status and clear bits are
available at an offset of
16 in INTEN, INTSTAT and INTCLEAR registers.

On Exynos5440,
the FALL_IRQEN bits are at an offset of 4
and the RISE_IRQEN bits are at an offset of 0
