ASoC: alc5623: Add device tree binding

Let the ALC5623 codec be instantiated from DT. Add a simple binding
for the additional control register and the jack detect register.

Also, add a prompt to the Kconfig entry for this CODEC, so that it can
be selected. Since kirkwood-t5325.c will no longer be used, we need to
be able to enable the CODEC in the mvebu_v5_defconfig etc.
