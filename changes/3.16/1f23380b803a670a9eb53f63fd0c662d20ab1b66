ASoC: Export devm_snd_soc_register_platform()

devm_snd_soc_register_platform() is used in drivers which can be build as
modules, so it needs to be exported to avoid linkers errors like:

	ERROR: "devm_snd_soc_register_platform" [sound/soc/omap/snd-soc-omap.ko] undefined!
	ERROR: "devm_snd_soc_register_platform" [sound/soc/davinci/snd-soc-davinci.ko] undefined!
