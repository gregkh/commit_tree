mfd: max14577: Fix IRQ handling after resume if this is not a wakeup source

During suspend the IRQ should be disabled even if this is not a wakeup
source. This is a proper way of fixing the IRQ handling issue during
resume (IRQ handler fails because I2C bus did not resume yet).

When device is suspended and max14577 interrupt is signaled the irq chip
will try to handle it regardless of wakeup source. Device could be woken
up by different IRQ but still the IRQ handler will try to read the
registers over I2C bus and fail because I2C bus won't be ready yet:
	max14577 2-0025: Failed to read IRQ status: -5
