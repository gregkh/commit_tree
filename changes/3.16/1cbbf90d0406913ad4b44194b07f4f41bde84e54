[media] af9035: override tuner id when bad value set into eeprom

Tuner ID set into EEPROM is wrong in some cases, which causes driver
to select wrong tuner profile. That leads device non-working. Fix
issue by overriding known bad tuner IDs with suitable default value.

Thanks to MX-NET Telekomunikace s.r.o. for providing non-working
DTV stick, that I could fix the bug!
