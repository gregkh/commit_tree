xen-netback: Fix releasing frag_list skbs in error path

When the grant operations failed, the skb is freed up eventually, and it tries
to release the frags, if there is any. For the main skb nr_frags is set to 0 to
avoid this, but on the frag_list it iterates through the frags array, and tries
to call put_page on the page pointer which contains garbage at that time.
