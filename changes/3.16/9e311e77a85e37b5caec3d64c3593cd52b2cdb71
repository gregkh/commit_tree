net/mlx4_en: Use affinity hint

The “affinity hint” mechanism is used by the user space
daemon, irqbalancer, to indicate a preferred CPU mask for irqs.
Irqbalancer can use this hint to balance the irqs between the
cpus indicated by the mask.

We wish the HCA to preferentially map the IRQs it uses to numa cores
close to it.  To accomplish this, we use cpumask_set_cpu_local_first(), that
sets the affinity hint according the following policy:
First it maps IRQs to “close” numa cores.  If these are exhausted, the
remaining IRQs are mapped to “far” numa cores.
