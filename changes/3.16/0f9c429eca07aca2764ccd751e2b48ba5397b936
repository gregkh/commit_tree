nfs: chain calls to pg_test

Now that pg_test can change the size of the request (by returning a non-zero
size smaller than the request), pg_test functions that call other
pg_test functions must return the minimum of the result - or 0 if any fail.

Also clean up the logic of some pg_test functions so that all checks are
for contitions where coalescing is not possible.
