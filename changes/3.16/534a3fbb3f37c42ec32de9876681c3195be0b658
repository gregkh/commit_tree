workqueue: simplify wq_update_unbound_numa() by jumping to use_dfl_pwq if the target cpumask equals wq's

wq_update_unbound_numa(), when it's decided that the newly updated
cpumask equals the default, looks at whether the current pwq is
already the default one and skips setting pwq to the default one.
This extra step is unnecessary and we can always jump to use_dfl_pwq
instead. Simplify the code by removing the conditional.
This doesn't make any functional difference.
