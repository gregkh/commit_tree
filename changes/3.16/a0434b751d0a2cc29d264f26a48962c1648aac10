Input: atmel_mxt_ts - wait for CHG after bootloader resets

Rather than msleep for MXT_RESET_TIME and MXT_FWRESET_TIME during the
transition to bootloader mode and the transition back from app, wait for
the CHG assert to indicate that the transition is done.

This change replaces the msleep with a wait for completion that the
mxt_interrupt handler signals.

Also add CHG poll after last firmware frame - some bootloader versions will
assert the interrupt line after the final frame, in testing this meant that
the driver attempts to read the info block too early whilst the chip is
still resetting.

This improves firmware update time as we no longer wait longer than
necessary for each reset.
