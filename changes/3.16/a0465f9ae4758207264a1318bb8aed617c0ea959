KVM: s390: Enable DAT support for TPROT handler

The TPROT instruction can be used to check the accessability of storage
for any kind of logical addresses. So far, our handler only supported
real addresses. This patch now also enables support for addresses that
have to be translated via DAT first. And while we're at it, change the
code to use the common KVM function gfn_to_hva_prot() to check for the
validity and writability of the memory page.
