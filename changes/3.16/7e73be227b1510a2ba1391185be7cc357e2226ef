usb: hub_handle_remote_wakeup() depends on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y

Per Alan:
"You mean from within hub_handle_remote_wakeup()?  That routine will
never get called if CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME isn't enabled, because khubd
never sees wakeup requests if they arise during system suspend.

In fact, that routine ought to go inside the "#ifdef CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME"
portion of hub.c, along with the other suspend/resume code."
