can: add hash based access to single EFF frame filters

In contrast to the direct access to the single SFF frame filters (which are
indexed by the SFF CAN ID itself) the single EFF frame filters are arranged
in a single linked hlist. To reduce the hlist traversal in the case of many
filter subscriptions a hash based access is introduced for single EFF filters.
