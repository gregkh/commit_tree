iommu/exynos: Turn on useful configuration options

This turns on FLPD_CACHE, ACGEN and SYSSEL.

FLPD_CACHE is a cache of 1st level page table entries that contains
the address of a 2nd level page table to reduce latency of page table
walking.

ACGEN is architectural clock gating that gates clocks by System MMU
itself if it is not active. Note that ACGEN is different from clock
gating by the CPU. ACGEN just gates clocks to the internal logic of
System MMU while clock gating by the CPU gates clocks to the System
MMU.

SYSSEL selects System MMU version in some Exynos SoCs. Some Exynos
SoCs have an option to select System MMU versions exclusively because
the SoCs adopts new System MMU version experimentally.

This also always selects LRU as TLB replacement policy. Selecting TLB
replacement policy is deprecated from System MMU 3.2. TLB in System
MMU 3.3 has single TLB replacement policy, LRU. The bit of MMU_CFG
selecting TLB replacement policy is remained as reserved.

QoS value of page table walking is set to 15 (highst value). System
MMU 3.3 can inherit QoS value of page table walking from its master
H/W's transaction. This new feature is enabled by default and QoS
value written to MMU_CFG is ignored.

This patch also adds simplifies the sysmmu version checking by
introducing some macros.
