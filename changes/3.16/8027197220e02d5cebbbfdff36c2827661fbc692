kprobes, x86: Prohibit probing on native_set_debugreg()/load_idt()

Since the kprobes uses do_debug for single stepping,
functions called from do_debug() before notify_die() must not
be probed.

And also native_load_idt() is called from paranoid_exit when
returning int3, this also must not be probed.
