net: cdc_ncm: always reallocate tx_curr_skb when tx_max increases

We are calling usbnet_start_xmit() to flush any remaining data,
depending on the side effect that tx_curr_skb is set to NULL,
ensuring a new allocation using the updated tx_max.  But this
side effect will only happen if there were any cached data ready
to transmit. If not, then an empty tx_curr_skb is still allocated
using the old tx_max size. Free it to avoid a buffer overrun.
