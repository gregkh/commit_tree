HID: usbhid: enable NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk for Semico USB Keykoard

The device which identifies itself as a "USB Keykoard" (no typo) with VID:PID
1a2c:0023 does not seem to be handling the reports initialization very well.
This results in a "usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed: -1" message from the kernel
when connected, and a delay before its initialization.  This patch adds the
quirk for this device, which causes the delay to disappear.
