btrfs: retrieve more info from FS_INFO ioctl

Provide the basic information about filesystem through the ioctl:
* b-tree node size (same as leaf size)
* sector size
* expected alignment of CLONE_RANGE and EXTENT_SAME ioctl arguments

Backward compatibility: if the values are 0, kernel does not provide
this information, the applications should ignore them.
