net: mv643xx_eth: Limit the TSO segments and adjust stop/wake thresholds

Currently small MSS values may require too many TSO descriptors for
the default queue size. This commit prevents this situation by fixing
the maximum supported TSO number of segments to 100 and by setting a
minimum Tx queue size. The minimum Tx queue size is set so that at
least 2 worst-case skb can be accommodated.

In addition, the queue stop and wake thresholds values are adjusted
accordingly. The queue is stopped when there's room for only 1 worst-case
skb and waked when the number of descriptors is half that value.
