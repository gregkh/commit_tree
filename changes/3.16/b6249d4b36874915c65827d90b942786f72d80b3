ARM: mvebu: switch to the new PMSU binding in Armada 370/XP Device Tree

Following the introduction of the new PMSU Device Tree binding, as
well as the separate CPU reset binding, this commit switches the
Armada 370 and Armada XP Device Trees to use them.

The PMSU node is moved from the Armada XP specific armada-xp.dtsi to
the common Armada 370/XP armada-370-xp.dtsi because the PMSU is in
fact available at the same location on both SOCs.

The CPU reset node is then added on both Armada 370 and Armada XP,
with a different compatible string. On Armada 370, the CPU reset
driver is not really needed as Armada 370 is single core and the only
use of the CPU reset driver is to boot secondary processors, but it
still makes sense to have this CPU reset register described in the
Device Tree.
