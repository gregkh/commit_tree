mmc: sdhci: clean up sdio interrupt enable handling

We don't need to change the SDHCI_SDIO_IRQ_ENABLED flag when we're
merely receiving an interrupt - IRQ handling thread in the MMC core
will either re-enable or disable the interrupt via the enable_sdio_irq
callback, which will update this status appropriately.
