x86/vdso: Remove some redundant in-memory section headers

.data doesn't need to be separate from .rodata: they're both readonly.

.altinstructions and .altinstr_replacement aren't needed by anything
except vdso2c; strip them from the final image.

While we're at it, rather than aligning the actual executable text,
just shove some unused-at-runtime data in between real data and
text.

My vdso image is still above 4k, but I'm disinclined to try to
trim it harder for 3.16.  For future trimming, I suspect that these
sections could be moved to later in the file and dropped from
the in-memory image:

.gnu.version and .gnu.version_d   (this may lose versions in gdb)
.eh_frame                         (should be harmless)
.eh_frame_hdr                     (I'm not really sure)
.hash                             (AFAIK nothing needs this section header)
