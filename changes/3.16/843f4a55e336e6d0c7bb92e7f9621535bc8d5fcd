tcp: use tcp_v4_send_synack on first SYN-ACK

To avoid large code duplication in IPv6, we need to first simplify
the complicate SYN-ACK sending code in tcp_v4_conn_request().

To use tcp_v4(6)_send_synack() to send all SYN-ACKs, we need to
initialize the mini socket's receive window before trying to
create the child socket and/or building the SYN-ACK packet. So we move
that initialization from tcp_make_synack() to tcp_v4_conn_request()
as a new function tcp_openreq_init_req_rwin().

After this refactoring the SYN-ACK sending code is simpler and easier
to implement Fast Open for IPv6.
