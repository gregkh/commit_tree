Btrfs: send, don't error in the presence of subvols/snapshots

If we are doing an incremental send and the base snapshot has a
directory with name X that doesn't exist anymore in the second
snapshot and a new subvolume/snapshot exists in the second snapshot
that has the same name as the directory (name X), the incremental
send would fail with -ENOENT error. This is because it attempts
to lookup for an inode with a number matching the objectid of a
root, which doesn't exist.

Steps to reproduce:

    mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdd
    mount /dev/sdd /mnt

    mkdir /mnt/testdir
    btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap1

    rmdir /mnt/testdir
    btrfs subvolume create /mnt/testdir
    btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap2

    btrfs send -p /mnt/mysnap1 /mnt/mysnap2 -f /tmp/send.data

A test case for xfstests follows.
