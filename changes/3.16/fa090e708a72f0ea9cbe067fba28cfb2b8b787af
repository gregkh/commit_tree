drbd: keep max-bio size during detach/attach on disconnected primary

We want to store in persistent meta data what the peer DRBD can handle,
which, due to spreading requests to multiple bios,
may be more than its backing device can handle.

Otherwise, if a disconnected Primary temporarily loses access to its local data
as well, we may accidentally shrink the max-bio setting, portentially causing
already assembled, but not yet processed, application bios to be spuriously
failed due to device limits.
