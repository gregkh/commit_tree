drm: pass the irq explicitly to drm_irq_install

Unfortunately this requires a drm-wide change, and I didn't see a sane
way around that. Luckily it's fairly simple, we just need to inline
the respective get_irq implementation from either drm_pci.c or
drm_platform.c.

With that we can now also remove drm_dev_to_irq from drm_irq.c.
