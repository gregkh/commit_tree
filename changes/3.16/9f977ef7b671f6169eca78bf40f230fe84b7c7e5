vhost-scsi: Include prot_bytes into expected data transfer length

This patch updates vhost_scsi_get_tag() to accept the combined
expected data transfer length + T10 PI bytes as the value passed
into target_submit_cmd().

This is required now that target-core logic in commit 14ef9200
expects to subtract se_cmd->prot_length from se_cmd->data_length.
