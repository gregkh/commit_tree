cfg80211: slightly clean up of cfg80211_sme_connect()

Wdev->ssid_len has already been set in cfg80211_connect() and is equal
to connect->ssid_len. Use wdev->ssid_len instead of connect->ssid_len
so it will be consistent with previous ssid assignment statement.

If bss is found in cfg80211_get_conn_bss(), wdev->conn->state is set
to CFG80211_CONN_AUTHENTICATE_NEXT in there. So it's not needed to set
it manually to CFG80211_CONN_AUTHENTICATE_NEXT if bss is found in that
function.
