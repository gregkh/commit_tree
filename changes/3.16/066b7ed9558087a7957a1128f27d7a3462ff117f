kbuild: Do not print the build directory with make -s

Commit c2e28dc9 (kbuild: Print the name of the build directory) prints
the name of the build directory for O= builds, but we should not be
doing this in make -s mode, so that commands like

  make -s O=<dir> kernelrelease

can be used by scripts. This matches the behavior of make itself, where
the -s option implies --no-print-directory.
