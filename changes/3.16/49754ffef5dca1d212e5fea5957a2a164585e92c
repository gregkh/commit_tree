ARM: mvebu: start using the CPU reset driver

This commit changes the PMSU driver to no longer map itself the CPU
reset registers, and instead call into the CPU reset driver to
deassert the secondary CPUs for SMP booting.

In order to provide Device Tree backward compatibility, the CPU reset
driver is extended to not only support its official compatible string
"marvell,armada-370-cpu-reset", but to also look at the PMSU
compatible string "marvell,armada-370-xp-pmsu" to find the CPU reset
registers address. This allows old Device Tree to work correctly with
newer kernel versions. Therefore, the CPU reset driver implements the
following logic:

 * If one of the normal compatible strings
   "marvell,armada-370-cpu-reset" is found, then we map its first
   memory resource as the CPU reset registers.

 * Otherwise, if none of the normal compatible strings have been
   found, we look for the "marvell,armada-370-xp-pmsu" compatible
   string, and we map the second memory as the CPU reset registers.
