blk-mq: make ->flush_rq fully transparent to drivers

Drivers shouldn't have to care about the block layer setting aside a
request to implement the flush state machine.  We already override the
mq context and tag to make it more transparent, but so far haven't deal
with the driver private data in the request.  Make sure to override this
as well, and while we're at it add a proper helper sitting in blk-mq.c
that implements the full impersonation.
