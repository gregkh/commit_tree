usb: chipidea: udc: delete td from req's td list at ep_dequeue

We need to delete un-finished td from current request's td list
at ep_dequeue API, otherwise, this non-user td will be remained
at td list before this request is freed. So if we do ep_queue->
ep_dequeue->ep_queue sequence, when the complete interrupt for
the second ep_queue comes, we search td list for this request,
the first td (added by the first ep_queue) will be handled, and
its status is still active, so we will consider the this transfer
still not be completed, but in fact, it has completed. It causes
the peripheral side considers it never receives current data for
this transfer.

We met this problem when do "Error Recovery Test - Device Configured"
test item for USBCV2 MSC test, the host has never received ACK for
the IN token for CSW due to peripheral considers it does not get this
CBW, the USBCV test log like belows:
