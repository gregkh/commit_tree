block: don't assume last put of shared tags is for the host

There is no inherent reason why the last put of a tag structure must be
the one for the Scsi_Host, as device model objects can be held for
arbitrary periods.  Merge blk_free_tags and __blk_free_tags into a single
funtion that just release a references and get rid of the BUG() when the
host reference wasn't the last.
