powerpc/boot: Define a routine to enter prom

This patch defines a 'prom' routine similar to 'enter_prom' in the
kernel.

The difference is in the MSR which is built before entering prom. Big
endian order is enforced as in the kernel but 32bit mode is not. It
prepares ground for the next patches which will introduce Little endian
order.
