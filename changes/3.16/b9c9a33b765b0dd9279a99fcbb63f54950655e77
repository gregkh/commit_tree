s390/compat: correct ucontext layout for high gprs

The uc_sigmask definition in the kernel differs from the one in the
glibc, the kernel uc_sigmask has 64 bits while the glibc verison
is 1024 bits. The extension of the ucontext structure for 64-bit
register support for 31-bit compat processes added a new field
uc_gprs_high which starts 8 bytes after the uc_sigmask field.
As the glibc view of the ucontext assumes a size of 128 bytes for
uc_sigmask add a 120 byte padding to the kernel structure
ucontext_extended after the 8 byte uc_sigmask.
