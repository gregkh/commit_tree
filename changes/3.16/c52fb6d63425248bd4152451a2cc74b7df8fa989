spi: rspi: Merge rspi_*_dma() into rspi_dma_transfer()

rspi_send_dma() and rspi_send_receive_dma() are very similar. Consolidate
into a single function rspi_dma_transfer(), and add missing checks for
dmaengine_submit() failures.

Both sg_table pointer parameters can be NULL, as RSPI supports TX-only
mode, and unidirectional DMA transfers will also be needed later for
Dual/Quad DMA support.
