fs/buffer.c: remove block_write_full_page_endio()

The last in-tree caller of block_write_full_page_endio() was removed in
January 2013.  It's time to remove the EXPORT_SYMBOL, which leaves
block_write_full_page() as the only caller of
block_write_full_page_endio(), so inline block_write_full_page_endio()
into block_write_full_page().
