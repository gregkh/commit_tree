arm64: Fix machine_shutdown() definition

This patch ports most of commit 19ab428f4b79 "ARM: 7759/1: decouple CPU
offlining from reboot/shutdown" by Stephen Warren from arch/arm to
arch/arm64.

machine_shutdown() is a hook for kexec. Add a comment saying so, since
it isn't obvious from the function name.

Halt, power-off, and restart have different requirements re: stopping
secondary CPUs than kexec has. The former simply require the secondary
CPUs to be quiesced somehow, whereas kexec requires them to be
completely non-operational, so that no matter where the kexec target
images are written in RAM, they won't influence operation of the
secondary CPUS,which could happen if the CPUs were still executing some
kind of pin loop. To this end, modify machine_halt, power_off, and
restart to call smp_send_stop() directly, rather than calling
machine_shutdown().

In machine_shutdown(), replace the call to smp_send_stop() with a call
to disable_nonboot_cpus(). This completely disables all but one CPU,
thus satisfying the kexec requirements a couple paragraphs above.
