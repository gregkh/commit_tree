xfs: fix Q_XQUOTARM ioctl

The Q_XQUOTARM quotactl was not working properly, because
we weren't passing around proper flags.  The xfs_fs_set_xstate()
ioctl handler used the same flags for Q_XQUOTAON/OFF as
well as for Q_XQUOTARM, but Q_XQUOTAON/OFF look for
XFS_UQUOTA_ACCT, XFS_UQUOTA_ENFD, XFS_GQUOTA_ACCT etc,
i.e. quota type + state, while Q_XQUOTARM looks only for
the type of quota, i.e. XFS_DQ_USER, XFS_DQ_GROUP etc.

Unfortunately these flag spaces overlap a bit, so we
got semi-random results for Q_XQUOTARM; i.e. the value
for XFS_DQ_USER == XFS_UQUOTA_ACCT, etc.  yeargh.

Add a new quotactl op vector specifically for the QUOTARM
operation, since it operates with a different flag space.

This has been broken more or less forever, AFAICT.
