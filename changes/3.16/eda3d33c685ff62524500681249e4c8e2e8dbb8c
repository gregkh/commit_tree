MIPS: KVM: Override guest kernel timer frequency directly

The KVM_HOST_FREQ Kconfig symbol was used by KVM guest kernels to
override the timer frequency calculation to a value based on the host
frequency. Now that the KVM timer emulation is implemented independent
of the host timer frequency and defaults to 100MHz, adjust the working
of CONFIG_KVM_HOST_FREQ to match.

The Kconfig symbol now specifies the guest timer frequency directly, and
has been renamed accordingly to KVM_GUEST_TIMER_FREQ. It now defaults to
100MHz too and the help text is updated to make it clear that a zero
value will allow the normal timer frequency calculation to take place
(based on the emulated RTC).
