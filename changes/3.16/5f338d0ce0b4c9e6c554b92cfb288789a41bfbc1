spi: rspi: SPI DMA core needs both RX and TX DMA to function

The SPI DMA core framework needs both RX and TX DMA to function.  As a
preparation for converting the driver to use this framework, fall back to
PIO if no DMA channel or only one DMA channel is available.

This affects only RSPI, which could do DMA transfers for TX-only before.
RSPI-RZ and QSPI (at least for Single SPI Transfers) will need both RX and
TX DMA anyway.
