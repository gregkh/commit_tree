xen-netfront: recreate queues correctly when reconnecting

When reconnecting to the backend (after a resume/migration, for example),
a different number of queues may be required (since the guest may have
moved to a different host with different capabilities).  During the
reconnection the old queues are torn down and new ones created.

Introduce xennet_create_queues() and xennet_destroy_queues() that fixes
three bugs during the reconnection.

- The old info->queues was leaked.
- The old queue's napi instances were not deleted.
- The new queue's napi instances were left disabled (which meant no
  packets could be received).

The xennet_destroy_queues() calls is deferred until the reconnection
instead of the disconnection (in xennet_disconnect_backend()) because
napi_disable() might sleep.
