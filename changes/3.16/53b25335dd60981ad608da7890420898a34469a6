perf: Disable sampled events if no PMU interrupt

Add common code to generate -ENOTSUPP at event creation time if an
architecture attempts to create a sampled event and
PERF_PMU_NO_INTERRUPT is set.

This adds a new pmu->capabilities flag.  Initially we only support
PERF_PMU_NO_INTERRUPT (to indicate a PMU has no support for generating
hardware interrupts) but there are other capabilities that can be
added later.
