tty: xuartps: Rebrand driver as Cadence UART

Zynq's UART is Cadence IP. Make this visible in the prompt in kconfig
and additional comments in the driver.
This also renames functions and symbols, as far as possible without
breaking user space API, to reflect the Cadence origin. This is achieved
through simple search and replace:
 - s/XUARTPS/CDNS_UART/g
 - s/xuartps/cdns_uart/g
The only exceptions are PORT_XUARTPS and the driver name, which stay as is,
due to their exposure to user space. As well as the - no legacy -
compatibility string 'xlnx,xuartps'
