Btrfs: remove unused wait queue in struct extent_buffer

The lock_wq wait queue is not used anywhere, therefore just remove it.
On a x86_64 system, this reduced sizeof(struct extent_buffer) from 320
bytes down to 296 bytes, which means a 4Kb page can now be used for
13 extent buffers instead of 12.
