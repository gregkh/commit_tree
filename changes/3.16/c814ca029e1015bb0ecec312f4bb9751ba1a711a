ARM: Check if a CPU has gone offline

PSCIv0.2 adds a new function called AFFINITY_INFO, which
can be used to query if a specified CPU has actually gone
offline. Calling this function via cpu_kill ensures that
a CPU has quiesced after a call to cpu_die. This helps
prevent the CPU from doing arbitrary bad things when data
or instructions are clobbered (as happens with kexec)
in the window between a CPU announcing that it is dead
and said CPU leaving the kernel.
