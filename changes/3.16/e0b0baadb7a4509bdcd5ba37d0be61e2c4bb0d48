tty/serial: at91: use mctrl_gpio helpers

On sam9x5, dedicated CTS (and RTS) pins are unusable together with the
LCDC, the EMAC, or the MMC because they share the same line.

Moreover, the USART controller doesn't handle DTR/DSR/DCD/RI signals,
so we have to control them via GPIO.

This patch permits to use GPIOs to control the CTS/RTS/DTR/DSR/DCD/RI
signals.
