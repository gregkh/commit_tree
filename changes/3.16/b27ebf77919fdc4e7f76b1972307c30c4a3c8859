mm:vmscan: update the trace-vmscan-postprocess.pl for event vmscan/mm_vmscan_lru_isolate

When using trace-vmscan-postprocess.pl for checking the file/anon rate
of scanning, we can find that it can not be performed.  At the same
time, the following message will be reported:

  WARNING: Format not as expected for event vmscan/mm_vmscan_lru_isolate
  'file' != 'contig_taken' Fewer fields than expected in format at
  ./trace-vmscan-postprocess.pl line 171, <FORMAT> line 76.

In trace-vmscan-postprocess.pl, (contig_taken, contig_dirty, and
contig_failed) are be associated respectively to (nr_lumpy_taken,
nr_lumpy_dirty, and nr_lumpy_failed) for lumpy reclaim.  Via commit
c53919adc045 ("mm: vmscan: remove lumpy reclaim"), lumpy reclaim had
already been removed by Mel, but the update for
trace-vmscan-postprocess.pl was missed.
