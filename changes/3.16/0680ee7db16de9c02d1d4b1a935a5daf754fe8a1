perf tools: Remove usage of trace_sched_wakeup(.success)

trace_sched_wakeup(.success) is a dead argument and has been for ages,
the only reason its still there is because of brain dead software, which
apparently includes perf tools

There's a few more instances in pearly snake shit, but that's not
supported as far as I care anyhow, so let that bitrot.
