PM / OPP: discard duplicate OPPs

We don't have any protection against addition of duplicate OPPs currently and in
case some code tries to add them, it will end up corrupting OPP tables.

We need to handle some duplication cases separately as returning error might not
be the right thing always. The new list of return values for dev_pm_opp_add()
are:

 0:         On success OR
            Duplicate OPPs (both freq and volt are same) and opp->available
 -EEXIST:   Freq are same and volt are different OR
            Duplicate OPPs (both freq and volt are same) and !opp->available
 -ENOMEM:   Memory allocation failure
