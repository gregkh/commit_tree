Revert "drm/i915: fix infinite loop at gen6_update_ring_freq"

This reverts commit 4b28a1f3ef55a3b0b68dbab1fe6dbaf18e186710.

This patch duct-tapes over some issue in the current bdw rps patches
which must wait with enabling rc6/rps until the very first batch has
been submitted by userspace.

But those patches aren't merged yet, and for upstream we need to have
an in-kernel emission of the very first batch. I shouldn't have
merged this patch so let's revert it again.

Also Imre noticed that even when rps is set up normally there's a
small window (due to the 1s delay of the async rps init work) where we
could runtime suspend already and blow up all over the place. Imre has
a proper fix to block runtime pm until the rps init work has
successfully completed.
