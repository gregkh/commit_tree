staging: rtl8723au: Remove buggy function _rtw_report_sec_ie()

This function was extremely buggy calling kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) while
holding a spin lock and then potentially overflowing the buffer it had
allocated.

Since the generated output wasn't used for anything, simply rip the
whole thing out.
