tcp: avoid retransmits of TCP packets hanging in host queues

In commit 0e280af026a5 ("tcp: introduce TCPSpuriousRtxHostQueues SNMP
counter") we added a logic to detect when a packet was retransmitted
while the prior clone was still in a qdisc or driver queue.

We are now confident we can do better, and catch the problem before
we fragment a TSO packet before retransmit, or in TLP path.

This patch fully exploits the logic by simply canceling the spurious
retransmit.
Original packet is in a queue and will eventually leave the host.

This helps to avoid network collapses when some events make the RTO
estimations very wrong, particularly when dealing with huge number of
sockets with synchronized blast.
