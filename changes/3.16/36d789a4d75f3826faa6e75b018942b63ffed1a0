perf probe: Improve error message for unknown member of data structure

Improve the error message if we can not find given member in the given
structure. Currently perf probe shows a wrong error message as below.

  -----
  # perf probe getname_flags:65 "result->BOGUS"
  result(type:filename) has no member BOGUS.
  Failed to find 'result' in this function.
    Error: Failed to add events. (-22)
  -----

The first message is correct, but the second one is not, since we didn't
fail to find a variable but fails to find the member of given variable.

  -----
  # perf probe getname_flags:65 "result->BOGUS"
  result(type:filename) has no member BOGUS.
    Error: Failed to add events. (-22)
  -----

With this patch, the error message shows only the first one.  And if we
really failed to find given variable, it tells us so.

  -----
  # perf probe getname_flags:65 "BOGUS"
  Failed to find 'BOGUS' in this function.
    Error: Failed to add events. (-2)
