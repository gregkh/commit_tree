MIPS: BCM1480: Remove checks for CONFIG_SIBYTE_BCM1480_PROF

There are two checks for CONFIG_SIBYTE_BCM1480_PROF in the tree since
v2.6.15. The related Kconfig symbol has never been added to the tree. So
these checks have always evaluated to false. Besides, one of these
checks guards a call of sbprof_cpu_intr(). But that function is not
defined. Remove all this.
