fnic: NoFIP solicitation frame in NONFIP mode and changed IO Throttle count

This patch contains following three minor fixes.

1) During Probe, fnic was sending FIP solicitation in Non FIP mode which is not
   expected, setting the internal fip state to Non FIP mode explicitly, avoids
   sending FIP frame.

2) When target goes offline, all outstanding IOs belong to the target will be
   terminated by driver, If the termination count is high, then it influences
   firmware responsiveness. To improve the responsiveness, default IO throttle
   count is reduced to 256.

3) Accessing Virtual Fabric Id (vfid) and fc_map of Fibre-Channel Forwarder(FCF)
   is invalid in fnic driver when Clear Virtual Link(CVL) is received prior to
   receiving flogi reject from switch. As CVL clears all FCFs.
