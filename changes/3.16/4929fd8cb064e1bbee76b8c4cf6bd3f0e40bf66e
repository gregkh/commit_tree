ip_tunnel: delete unneeded call to netdev_priv

Netdev_priv is an accessor function, and has no purpose if its result is
not used.

A simplified version of the semantic match that fixes this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@ local idexpression x; @@
-x = netdev_priv(...);
... when != x
// </smpl>
