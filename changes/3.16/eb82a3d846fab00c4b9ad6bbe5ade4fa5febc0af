phy: omap-usb2: Balance pm_runtime_enable() on probe failure and remove

If probe fails then we need to call pm_runtime_disable() to balance
out the previous pm_runtime_enable() call. Else it will cause
unbalanced pm_runtime_enable() call in the succeding probe call.

This anomaly was observed when the call to devm_phy_create() failed
with -EPROBE_DEFER.

Balance out the pm_runtime_enable() call in .remove() as well.
