numa,sched: fix load_to_imbalanced logic inversion

This function is supposed to return true if the new load imbalance is
worse than the old one.  It didn't.  I can only hope brown paper bags
are in style.

Now things converge much better on both the 4 node and 8 node systems.

I am not sure why this did not seem to impact specjbb performance on the
4 node system, which is the system I have full-time access to.

This bug was introduced recently, with commit e63da03639cc ("sched/numa:
Allow task switch if load imbalance improves")
