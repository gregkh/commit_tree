scsi/NCR5380: reduce depth of sun3_scsi nested includes

Move the #include "NCR5380.h" out of the sun3_scsi.h header file and into
the driver .c files, like all the other NCR5380 drivers in the tree.

This improves uniformity and reduces the depth of nested includes. The
sequence of #include's, #define's and #if's no longer does my head in.
