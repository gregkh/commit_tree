sched: Let 'struct sched_group_power' care about CPU capacity

It is better not to think about compute capacity as being equivalent
to "CPU power".  The upcoming "power aware" scheduler work may create
confusion with the notion of energy consumption if "power" is used too
liberally.

Since struct sched_group_power is really about compute capacity of sched
groups, let's rename it to struct sched_group_capacity. Similarly sgp
becomes sgc. Related variables and functions dealing with groups are also
adjusted accordingly.
