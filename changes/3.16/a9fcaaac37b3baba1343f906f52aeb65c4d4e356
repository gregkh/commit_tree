tracing: Fix memory leak on instance deletion

When an instance is created, it also gets a snapshot ring buffer
allocated (with minimum of pages). But when it is deleted the snapshot
buffer is not. There was a helper function added to match the allocation
of these ring buffers to a way to free them, but it wasn't used by
the deletion of an instance. Using that helper function solves this
memory leak.
