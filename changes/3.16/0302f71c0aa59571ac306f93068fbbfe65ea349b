efi: add helper function to get UEFI params from FDT

ARM and ARM64 architectures use the device tree to pass UEFI parameters
from stub to kernel. These parameters are things known to the stub but
not discoverable by the kernel after the stub calls ExitBootSerives().
There is a helper function in:

   drivers/firmware/efi/fdt.c

which the stub uses to add the UEFI parameters to the device tree.
This patch adds a complimentary helper function which UEFI runtime
support may use to retrieve the parameters from the device tree.
If an architecture wants to use this helper, it should select
CONFIG_EFI_PARAMS_FROM_FDT.
