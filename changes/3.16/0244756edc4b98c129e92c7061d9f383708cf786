ufs: sb mutex merge + mutex_destroy

Commit 788257d6101d ("ufs: remove the BKL") replaced BKL with mutex
protection using functions lock_ufs, unlock_ufs and struct mutex 'mutex'
in sb_info.

Commit b6963327e052 ("ufs: drop lock/unlock super") removed lock/unlock
super and added struct mutex 's_lock' in sb_info.

Those 2 mutexes are generally locked/unlocked at the same time except in
allocation (balloc, ialloc).

This patch merges the 2 mutexes and propagates first commit solution.
It also adds mutex destruction before kfree during ufs_fill_super
failure and ufs_put_super.
