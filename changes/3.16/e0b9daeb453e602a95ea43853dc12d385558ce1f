mm, compaction: embed migration mode in compact_control

We're going to want to manipulate the migration mode for compaction in the
page allocator, and currently compact_control's sync field is only a bool.

Currently, we only do MIGRATE_ASYNC or MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT compaction
depending on the value of this bool.  Convert the bool to enum
migrate_mode and pass the migration mode in directly.  Later, we'll want
to avoid MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT for thp allocations in the pagefault patch to
avoid unnecessary latency.

This also alters compaction triggered from sysfs, either for the entire
system or for a node, to force MIGRATE_SYNC.
