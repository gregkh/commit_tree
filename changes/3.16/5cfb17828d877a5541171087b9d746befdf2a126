IB/srp: Add fast registration support

Certain HCA types (e.g. Connect-IB) and certain configurations (e.g.
ConnectX VF) support fast registration but not FMR. Hence add fast
registration support.

In function srp_rport_reconnect(), move the the srp_finish_req()
loop from after to before the srp_create_target_ib() call. This is
needed to avoid that srp_finish_req() tries to queue any
invalidation requests for rkeys associated with the old queue pair
on the newly allocated queue pair. Invoking srp_finish_req() before
the queue pair has been reallocated is safe since srp_claim_req()
handles completions correctly that arrive after srp_finish_req()
has been invoked.
