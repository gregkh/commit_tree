tipc: fix potential bug in function tipc_backlog_rcv

In commit 4f4482dcd9a0606a30541ff165ddaca64748299b ("tipc: compensate
for double accounting in socket rcv buffer") we access 'truesize' of
a received buffer after it might have been released by the function
filter_rcv().

In this commit we correct this by reading the value of 'truesize' to
the stack before delivering the buffer to filter_rcv().
