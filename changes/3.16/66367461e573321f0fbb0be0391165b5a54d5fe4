drm/exynos: use 4WORD dma burst length for small fbs

In case of exynos, setting dma-burst to 16Word causes permanent
tearing for very small buffers, e.g. cursor buffer. Burst Mode
switching, which is based on overlay size is not recommended as
overlay size varies a lot towards the end of the screen. This
causes unstable DMA which results into tearing again.

Rendering small buffers with lower burst size doesn't
cause any noticable performance overhead. 128 pixel width is
selected based on mulitple experiments with exynos5 SoCs.
