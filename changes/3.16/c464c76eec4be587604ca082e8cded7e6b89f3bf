perf: Allow building PMU drivers as modules

This patch adds support for building PMU driver as module. It exports
the functions perf_pmu_{register,unregister}() and adds reference tracking
for the PMU driver module.

When the PMU driver is built as a module, each active event of the PMU
holds a reference to the driver module.
