powerpc: ABIv2 function calls must place target address in r12

To establish addressability quickly, ABIv2 requires the target
address of the function being called to be in r12. Fix a number of
places in assembly code that we do indirect function calls.

We need to avoid function descriptors on ABIv2 too.
