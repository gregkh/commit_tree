KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Use SLB entry 0

We didn't make use of SLB entry 0 because ... of no good reason. SLB entry 0
will always be used by the Linux linear SLB entry, so the fact that slbia
does not invalidate it doesn't matter as we overwrite SLB 0 on exit anyway.

Just enable use of SLB entry 0 for our shadow SLB code.
