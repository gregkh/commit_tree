drm/radeon: add large PTE support for NI, SI and CIK v5

This patch implements support for VRAM page table entry compression.
PTE construction is enhanced to identify physically contiguous page
ranges and mark them in the PTE fragment field. L1/L2 TLB support is
enabled for 64KB (SI/CIK) and 256KB (NI) PTE fragments, significantly
improving TLB utilization for VRAM allocations.

Linear store bandwidth is improved from 60GB/s to 125GB/s on Pitcairn.
Unigine Heaven 3.0 sees an average improvement from 24.7 to 27.7 FPS
on default settings at 1920x1200 resolution with vsync disabled.

See main comment in radeon_vm.c for a technical description.

v2 (chk): rebased and simplified.
v3 (chk): add missing hw setup
v4 (chk): rebased on current drm-fixes-3.15
v5 (chk): fix comments and commit text
