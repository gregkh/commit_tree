lib: Export interval_tree

lib/interval_tree.c provides a simple interface for an interval-tree
(an augmented red-black tree) but is only built when testing the generic
macros for building interval-trees. For drivers with modest needs,
export the simple interval-tree library as is.

v2: Lots of help from Michel Lespinasse to only compile the code
    as required:
    - make INTERVAL_TREE a config option
    - make INTERVAL_TREE_TEST select the library functions
      and sanitize the filenames & Makefile
    - prepare interval_tree for being built as a module if required
