btrfs: tree_search, copy_to_sk: return EOVERFLOW for too small buffer

In copy_to_sk, if an item is too large for the given buffer, it now returns
-EOVERFLOW instead of copying a search_header with len = 0. For backward
compatibility for the first item it still copies such a header to the buffer,
but not any other following items, which could have fitted.

tree_search changes -EOVERFLOW back to 0 to behave similiar to the way it
behaved before this patch.
