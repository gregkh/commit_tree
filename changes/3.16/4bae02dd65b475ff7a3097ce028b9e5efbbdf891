ARM: orion5x: update I2C description at SoC level

This commit fixes the Orion5x SoC definition to:

 * Not define a clock-frequency, as it should be described on a
   per-board basis.

 * Declare the appropriate clock reference, so that the driver can do
   correct divisors calculations for the I2C bus.
