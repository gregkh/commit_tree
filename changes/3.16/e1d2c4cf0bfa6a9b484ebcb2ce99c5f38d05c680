ACPI / scan: drop IDs that do not comply with the ACPI PNP ID rule

The PNP ACPI scan handler device ID list includes all the IDs from
all of the struct pnp_device_id instances in the tree, but some of
them do not follow the ACPI PNP ID rule (3 letters + 4 hex digits).

For those IDs, the coressponding devices will never be enumerated
via ACPI, so it is safe to remove them from the PNP ACPI ID list.
