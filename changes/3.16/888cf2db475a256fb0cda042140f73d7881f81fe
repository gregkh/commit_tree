mm: avoid unnecessary atomic operations during end_page_writeback()

If a page is marked for immediate reclaim then it is moved to the tail of
the LRU list.  This occurs when the system is under enough memory pressure
for pages under writeback to reach the end of the LRU but we test for this
using atomic operations on every writeback.  This patch uses an optimistic
non-atomic test first.  It'll miss some pages in rare cases but the
consequences are not severe enough to warrant such a penalty.

While the function does not dominate profiles during a simple dd test the
cost of it is reduced.
