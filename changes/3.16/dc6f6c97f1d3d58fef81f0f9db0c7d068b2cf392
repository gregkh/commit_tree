memcg: kill start_kernel()->mm_init_owner(&init_mm)

Remove start_kernel()->mm_init_owner(&init_mm, &init_task).

This doesn't really hurt but unnecessary and misleading.  init_task is the
"swapper" thread == current, its ->mm is always NULL.  And init_mm can
only be used as ->active_mm, not as ->mm.

mm_init_owner() has a single caller with this patch, perhaps it should
die.  mm_init() can initialize ->owner under #ifdef.
