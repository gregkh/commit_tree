iwlwifi: pcie: implement GRO without NAPI

Use the new NAPI infrastructure added to mac80211 to get
GRO. We don't really implement NAPI since we don't have
a real poll function and we never schedule a NAPI poll.
Instead of this, we collect all the packets we got from a
single interrupt and then call napi_gro_flush().

This allows us to benefit from GRO. In half duplex medium
like WiFi, its main advantage is that it reduces the number
of TCP Acks, hence improving the TCP Rx performance.

Since we call the Rx path with a spinlock held, remove
the might_sleep mention from the op_mode's API.
