staging: ctx1e1: remove checks for three macros

When the ctx1e1 driver was added in v2.6.35 it contained checks for
CONFIG_SBE_HDLC_V7, CONFIG_SBE_WAN256T3_HDLC_V7, and
CONFIG_SBE_WAN256T3_NCOMM (and MODULE variants). The related Kconfig
symbols didn't exist then. They still don't exist now. Remove these
checks.

Do some related cleaning up and remove the unused V7() macro too.
