ASoC: core: Add helpers for codec and codec_dai search

Add dedicated helpers for codec and codec_dai search in preparation
for DAI-multicodec. It will help reducing the extra indentation
that will be introduced by the iteration over multiple codecs.

Previous implementation unnecessarily kept searching for a matching
codec in the remaining register codecs even if it was already found.

Fix that by returning in case of matching.
