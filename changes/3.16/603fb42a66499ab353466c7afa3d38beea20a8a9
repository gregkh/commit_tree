ARM: 8011/1: ARM hibernation / suspend-to-disk

Enable hibernation for ARM architectures and provide ARM
architecture specific calls used during hibernation.

The swsusp hibernation framework depends on the
platform first having functional suspend/resume.

Then, in order to enable hibernation on a given platform, a
platform_hibernation_ops structure may need to be registered with
the system in order to save/restore any SoC-specific / cpu specific
state needing (re)init over a suspend-to-disk/resume-from-disk cycle.

For example:

     - "secure" SoCs that have different sets of control registers
       and/or different CR reg access patterns.

     - SoCs with L2 caches as the activation sequence there is
       SoC-dependent; a full off-on cycle for L2 is not done
       by the hibernation support code.

     - SoCs requiring steps on wakeup _before_ the "generic" parts
       done by cpu_suspend / cpu_resume can work correctly.

     - SoCs having persistent state which is maintained during suspend
       and resume, but will be lost during the power off cycle after
       suspend-to-disk.

This is a rebase/rework of Frank Hofmann's v5 hibernation patchset.
