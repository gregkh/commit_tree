mm/numa: Remove BUG_ON() in __handle_mm_fault()

Changing PTEs and PMDs to pte_numa & pmd_numa is done with the
mmap_sem held for reading, which means a pmd can be instantiated
and turned into a numa one while __handle_mm_fault() is examining
the value of old_pmd.

If that happens, __handle_mm_fault() should just return and let
the page fault retry, instead of throwing an oops. This is
handled by the test for pmd_trans_huge(*pmd) below.
