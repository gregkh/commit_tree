drm/i915: Virtualize the ringbuffer signal func

This abstraction again is in preparation for gen8. Gen8 will bring new
semantics for doing this operation.

While here, make the writes of MI_NOOPs explicit for non-existent rings.
This should have been implicit before.

NOTE: This is going to be removed in a few patches.
