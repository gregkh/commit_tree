blk-mq: allow non-softirq completions

Right now we export two ways of completing a request:

1) blk_mq_complete_request(). This uses an IPI (if needed) and
   completes through q->softirq_done_fn(). It also works with
   timeouts.

2) blk_mq_end_io(). This completes inline, and ignores any timeout
   state of the request.

Let blk_mq_complete_request() handle non-softirq_done_fn completions
as well, by just completing inline. If a driver has enough completion
ports to place completions correctly, it need not define a
mq_ops->complete() and we can avoid an indirect function call by
doing the completion inline.
