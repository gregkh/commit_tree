cgroup: introduce effective cgroup_subsys_state

In the planned default unified hierarchy, controllers may get
dynamically attached to and detached from a cgroup and a cgroup may
not have csses for all the controllers associated with the hierarchy.

When a cgroup doesn't have its own css for a given controller, the css
of the nearest ancestor with the controller enabled will be used,
which is called the effective css.  This patch introduces
cgroup_e_css() and for_each_e_css() to access the effective csses and
convert compare_css_sets(), find_existing_css_set() and
cgroup_migrate() to use the effective csses so that they can handle
cgroups with partial csses correctly.

This means that for two css_sets to be considered identical, they
should have both matching csses and cgroups.  compare_css_sets()
already compares both, not for correctness but for optimization.  As
this now becomes a matter of correctness, update the comments
accordingly.

For all !default hierarchies, cgroup_e_css() always equals
cgroup_css(), so this patch doesn't change behavior.

While at it, fix incorrect locking comment for for_each_css().
