mfd: mc13xxx-core: Initialize the lock prior to using it

After request_threaded_irq() is called there is a chance that an interrupt
may occur before the 'mc13xxx->lock' is initialized, which will trigger a kernel
oops.

In order to prevent that, move the initialization of 'mc13xxx->lock' prior to
requesting the interrupts.
