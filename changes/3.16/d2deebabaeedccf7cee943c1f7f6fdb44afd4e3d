booke/watchdog: refine and clean up the codes

Basically, this patch does the following:
1. Move the codes of parsing boot parameters from setup-common.c
   to driver. In this way, code reader can know directly that
   there are boot parameters that can change the timeout.
2. Make boot parameter 'booke_wdt_period' effective.
   currently, when driver is loaded, default timeout is always
   being used in stead of booke_wdt_period.
3. Wrap up the watchdog timeout in device struct and clean up
   unnecessary codes.
