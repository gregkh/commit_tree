tracing: Remove myself as a tracing maintainer

It has been a while since I last sent a tracing patch. I always keep an
eye on tracing evolutions and contributions in general but given
how busy I am with nohz, isolation and more generally core cleanups stuff,
I seldom have time left to provide deep reviews of tracing patches nor
simply for reviews to begin with.

I've been very lucky to start kernel development on a very young subsystem
with tons of low hanging fruits back in 2008. Given that it deals with
a lot of tricky stuffs all around (sched, timers, irq, preemption, NMIs,
SMP, RCU, ....) I basically learned everything there.

Steve has been doing most of the incredible work these last years.
Thanks a lot!

Of course consider me always available to help on tracing if any hard
days happen.
