ARM: imx6q: add the missing esai_ahb clock

The esai_ahb clock is derived from ahb and used to provide ESAI the
capability of register accessing and FSYS clock source for I2S clocks
dividing.  The gate bits of this esai_ahb clock are shared with the
esai clock -- the baud clock, so we need to call imx_clk_gate2_shared()
for these two clocks.
