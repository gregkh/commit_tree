tipc: fix a possible memory leak

The commit a8b9b96e959f3c035af20b1bd2ba67b0b7269b19 ("tipc: fix race
in disc create/delete") leads to the following static checker warning:

	net/tipc/discover.c:352 tipc_disc_create()
		warn: possible memory leak of 'req'

The risk of memory leak really exists in practice. Especially when
it's failed to allocate memory for "req->buf", tipc_disc_create()
doesn't free its allocated memory, instead just directly returns
with ENOMEM error code. In this situation, memory leak, of course,
happens.
