pinctrl: allows not to define the get_group_pins operation

When using a group only pinctrl driver, which does not have any
information on the pins it is useless to define a get_group_pins
always returning an empty list of pins.

When not using get_group_pin[1], a driver must implement it so
pins = NULL and num_pins = 0. This patch makes it the default
behaviour if not defined in the pinctrl driver when used in
pinmux enable and disable funtions and in pinctrl_groups_show.

It also adds a check in pinctrl_get_group_pins and return -EINVAL if
not defined. This function is called in the gpiolib when adding when
pingroup range. It cannot be used if no group is defined, so this seams
reasonable.

[1] get_group_pin(struct pinctrl_dev *pctldev,
		  unsigned selector,
		  const unsigned **pins,
		  unsigned *num_pins);
