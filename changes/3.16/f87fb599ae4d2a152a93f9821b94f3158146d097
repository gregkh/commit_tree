memcg: mm_update_next_owner() should skip kthreads

"Search through everything else" in mm_update_next_owner() can hit a
kthread which adopted this "mm" via use_mm(), it should not be used as
mm->owner.  Add the PF_KTHREAD check.

While at it, change this code to use for_each_process_thread() instead
of deprecated do_each_thread/while_each_thread.
