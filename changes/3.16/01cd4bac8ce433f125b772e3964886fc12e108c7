ACPI / scan: drop unsupported serial IDs from PNP ACPI scan handler ID list

The "serial" PNP driver supports some "unknown" PNP modems
(PNPCXXX/PNPDXXX) by matching magic strings in the PNP device name
or the PNP device card name.

ACPI enumerated PNP devices neither are PNP cards, nor have those
magic strings in device names, so this mechamism never actually works
for ACPI enumerated PNPCXXX/PNPDXXX devices.

Consequently, it is safe to remove those two IDs from the PNP ACPI scan
handler's device ID list.
