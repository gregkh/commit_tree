ASoC: Intel: Allow byt-5640 machine driver and SST core go to suspend

Since there is no support for compressed audio in Baytrail ADSP firmware
there is no need to leave it on during suspend since ALSA PCM buffers are
too small for leaving ADSP on for playing or recording.

Implement PM callbacks to Baytrail byt-rt5640.c machine driver that call
snd_soc_suspend and snd_soc_resume functions and unset the ignore_suspend
fields in DAI links.

This makes soc-core and ALSA core gracefully suspend and resume active
stream and call sst_byt_pcm_trigger() during suspend-resume cycle.
