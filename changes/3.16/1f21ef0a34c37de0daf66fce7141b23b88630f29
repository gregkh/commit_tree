Btrfs: check if items are ordered when a leaf is marked dirty

To ease finding bugs during development related to modifying btree leaves
in such a way that it makes its items not sorted by key anymore. Since this
is an expensive check, it's only enabled if CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY
is set, which isn't meant to be enabled for regular users.
