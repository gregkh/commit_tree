PM / sleep: Use valid_state() for platform-dependent sleep states only

Use the observation that, for platform-dependent sleep states
(PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY, PM_SUSPEND_MEM), a given state is either
always supported or always unsupported and store that information
in pm_states[] instead of calling valid_state() every time we
need to check it.

Also do not use valid_state() for PM_SUSPEND_FREEZE, which is always
valid, and move the pm_test_level validity check for PM_SUSPEND_FREEZE
directly into enter_state().
