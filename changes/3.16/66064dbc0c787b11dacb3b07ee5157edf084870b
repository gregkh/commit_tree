be2net: fix qnq mode detection on VFs

The driver (on PF or VF) needs to detect if the function is in qnq mode for
a HW hack in be_rx_compl_get() to work.

The driver queries this information using the GET_PROFILE_CONFIG cmd
(since the commit below can caused this regression.) But this cmd is not
available on VFs and so the VFs fail to detect qnq mode. This causes
vlan traffic to not work.

The fix is to use the the adapter->function_mode value queried via
QUERY_FIRMWARE_CONFIG cmd on both PFs and VFs to detect the qnq mode.

Also QNQ_MODE was incorrectly named FLEX10_MODE; correcting that too as the
fix reads much better with the name change.

Fixes: f93f160b5 ("refactor multi-channel config code for Skyhawk-R chip")
