uprobes: Teach copy_insn() to support tmpfs

tmpfs is widely used but as Denys reports shmem_aops doesn't have
->readpage() and thus you can't probe a binary on this filesystem.

As Hugh suggested we can use shmem_read_mapping_page() in this case,
just we need to check shmem_mapping() if ->readpage == NULL.
