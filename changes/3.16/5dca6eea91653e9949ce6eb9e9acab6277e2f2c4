Btrfs: mark mapping with error flag to report errors to userspace

According to commit 865ffef3797da2cac85b3354b5b6050dc9660978
(fs: fix fsync() error reporting),
it's not stable to just check error pages because pages can be
truncated or invalidated, we should also mark mapping with error
flag so that a later fsync can catch the error.
