ACPI / video: Add use native backlight quirk for the ThinkPad W530

Like all of the other *30 ThinkPad models, the W530 has a broken acpi-video
backlight control. Note in order for this to actually fix things on the
ThinkPad W530 the commit titled:
"nouveau: Don't check acpi_video_backlight_support() before registering backlight"
is also needed.
