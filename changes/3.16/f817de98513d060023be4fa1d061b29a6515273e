cgroup: prepare migration path for unified hierarchy

Unified hierarchy implementation would require re-migrating tasks onto
the same cgroup on the default hierarchy to reflect updated effective
csses.  Update cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst() so that it accepts NULL as
the destination cgrp.  When NULL is specified, the destination is
considered to be the cgroup on the default hierarchy associated with
each css_set.

After this change, the identity check in cgroup_migrate_add_src()
isn't sufficient for noop detection as the associated csses may change
without any cgroup association changing.  The only way to tell whether
a migration is noop or not is testing whether the source and
destination csets are identical.  The noop check in
cgroup_migrate_add_src() is removed and cset identity test is added to
cgroup_migreate_prepare_dst().  If it's detected that source and
destination csets are identical, the cset is removed removed from
@preloaded_csets and all the migration nodes are cleared which makes
cgroup_migrate() ignore the cset.

Also, make the function append the destination css_sets to
@preloaded_list so that destination css_sets always come after source
css_sets.
