cgroup: remove cgroup_destory_css_killed()

cgroup_destroy_css_killed() is cgroup destruction stage which happens
after all csses are offlined.  After the recent updates, it no longer
does anything other than putting the base reference.  This patch
removes the function and makes cgroup_destroy_locked() put the base
ref at the end isntead.

This also makes cgroup->nr_css unnecessary.  Removed.
