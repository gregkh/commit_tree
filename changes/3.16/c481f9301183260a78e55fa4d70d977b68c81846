perf ui/tui: Fix off-by-one in hist_browser__update_nr_entries()

The nr_entries variable is increased inside the loop in the function
but it always count the first entry regardless of it's filtered or
not; caused an off-by-one error.

It'd become a problem especially there's no entry at all - it'd get a
segfault during referencing a NULL pointer.
