HID: i2c-hid: hid report descriptor retrieval changes

Reading the partial HID Descriptor is causing a firmware lockup in some
sensor hubs. Instead of a partial read, this patch implements the
i2c hid fetch using a fixed descriptor size (30 bytes) followed by a
verification of the BCDVersion (V01.00), and value stored in
wHIDDescLength (30 Bytes) for V1.00 descriptors.

As per i2c hid spec, this is the preferred model.

From hid-over-i2c-protocol-spec-v1-0:

  There are a variety of ways a HOST may choose to retrieve
  the HID Descriptor from the DEVICE. The following is a preferred
  implementation but should not be considered the only implementation.
  A HOST may read the entire HID Descriptor in a single read by
  issuing a read for 30 Bytes to get the entire HID Descriptor
  from the DEVICE.However, the HOST is responsible for validating that

  1. The BCDVersion is V01.00 (later revisions may have different
     descriptor lengths), and

  2. The value stored in wHIDDescLength is 30 (Bytes) for V1.00
     descriptors.
