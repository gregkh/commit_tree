Documentation: dt-bindings: update xhci-platform DT binding

This commit extends the compatible string list of the xhci-platform
binding with the new "armada-375-xhci" and "armada-380-xhci"
compatible strings. It is used to describe the XHCI controller which
is available in the Armada 375 and 38x SoCs.

It also indicates that an optional 'clocks' property is now supported.
