ASoC: Remove name_prefix unset during DAI link init hack again

This was initially removed in commit 6479f15ad ("ASoC: Remove name_prefix unset
during DAI link init hack"), but was brought back in commit 503ae5e0 ("ASoC:
core: Add helpers for dai link and aux dev init") by accident. This patch
removes it again.
