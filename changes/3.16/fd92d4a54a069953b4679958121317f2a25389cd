arm64: is_compat_task is defined both in asm/compat.h and linux/compat.h

Some kernel files may include both linux/compat.h and asm/compat.h directly
or indirectly. Since both header files contain is_compat_task() under
!CONFIG_COMPAT, compiling them with !CONFIG_COMPAT will eventually fail.
Such files include kernel/auditsc.c, kernel/seccomp.c and init/do_mountfs.c
(do_mountfs.c may read asm/compat.h via asm/ftrace.h once ftrace is
implemented).

So this patch proactively
1) removes is_compat_task() under !CONFIG_COMPAT from asm/compat.h
2) replaces asm/compat.h to linux/compat.h in kernel/*.c,
   but asm/compat.h is still necessary in ptrace.c and process.c because
   they use is_compat_thread().
