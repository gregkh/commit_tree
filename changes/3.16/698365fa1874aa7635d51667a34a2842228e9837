net: clean up snmp stats code

commit 8f0ea0fe3a036a47767f9c80e (snmp: reduce percpu needs by 50%)
reduced snmp array size to 1, so technically it doesn't have to be
an array any more. What's more, after the following commit:

	commit 933393f58fef9963eac61db8093689544e29a600
	Date:   Thu Dec 22 11:58:51 2011 -0600

	    percpu: Remove irqsafe_cpu_xxx variants

	    We simply say that regular this_cpu use must be safe regardless of
	    preemption and interrupt state.  That has no material change for x86
	    and s390 implementations of this_cpu operations.  However, arches that
	    do not provide their own implementation for this_cpu operations will
	    now get code generated that disables interrupts instead of preemption.

probably no arch wants to have SNMP_ARRAY_SZ == 2. At least after
almost 3 years, no one complains.

So, just convert the array to a single pointer and remove snmp_mib_init()
and snmp_mib_free() as well.
