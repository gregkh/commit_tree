workqueue: destroy worker directly in the idle timeout handler

Since destroy_worker() doesn't need to sleep nor require manager_mutex,
destroy_worker() can be directly called in the idle timeout
handler, it helps us remove POOL_MANAGE_WORKERS and
maybe_destroy_worker() and simplify the manage_workers()

After POOL_MANAGE_WORKERS is removed, worker_thread() doesn't
need to test whether it needs to manage after processed works.
So we can remove the test branch.
