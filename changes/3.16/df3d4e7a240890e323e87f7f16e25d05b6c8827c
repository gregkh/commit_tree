hfsplus: fix compiler warning on PowerPC

Commit a99b7069aab8 ("hfsplus: Fix undefined __divdi3 in
hfsplus_init_header_node()") introduced do_div() to xattr.c and the
warning below too.

As Geert remarked: "tmp" is "loff_t" which is "__kernel_loff_t", which
is "long long", i.e.  signed, while include/asm-generic/div64.h compares
its type with "uint64_t".  As inode sizes are positive, it should be
safe to change the type of "tmp" to "u64".
