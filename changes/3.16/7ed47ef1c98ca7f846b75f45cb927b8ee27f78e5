ARM: dts: Add Phytec pbab01 with i.MX6 DualLite/Solo

The PBA-B-01 carrier board can be equipped with either Quad or DualLite/Solo
phyFLEX i.MX6 modules (PFL-A-02).
This moves all common devices into imx6qdl-phytec-pbab01.dtsi. The SoC specific
device trees then just include the pfla01 and pbab01 dtsi files corresponding
to the SoC variant.
