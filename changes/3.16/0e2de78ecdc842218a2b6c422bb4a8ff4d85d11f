clk: divider: Optimize clk_divider_bestdiv loop

Currently, the for-loop used to try all the different dividers to find the
one that best fit tries all the values from 1 to max_div, incrementing by one.
In case of power-of-two, or table based divider, the loop isn't optimal.

Instead of incrementing by one, this patch provides directly the next divider.
