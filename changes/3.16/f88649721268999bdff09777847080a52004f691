ipv4: fix dst race in sk_dst_get()

When IP route cache had been removed in linux-3.6, we broke assumption
that dst entries were all freed after rcu grace period. DST_NOCACHE
dst were supposed to be freed from dst_release(). But it appears
we want to keep such dst around, either in UDP sockets or tunnels.

In sk_dst_get() we need to make sure dst refcount is not 0
before incrementing it, or else we might end up freeing a dst
twice.

DST_NOCACHE set on a dst does not mean this dst can not be attached
to a socket or a tunnel.

Then, before actual freeing, we need to observe a rcu grace period
to make sure all other cpus can catch the fact the dst is no longer
usable.
