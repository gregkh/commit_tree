MIPS: MT: Remove SMTC support

Nobody is maintaining SMTC anymore and there also seems to be no userbase.
Which is a pity - the SMTC technology primarily developed by Kevin D.
Kissell <kevink@paralogos.com> is an ingenious demonstration for the MT
ASE's power and elegance.

Based on Markos Chandras <Markos.Chandras@imgtec.com> patch
https://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/6719/ which while very similar did
no longer apply cleanly when I tried to merge it plus some additional
post-SMTC cleanup - SMTC was a feature as tricky to remove as it was to
merge once upon a time.
