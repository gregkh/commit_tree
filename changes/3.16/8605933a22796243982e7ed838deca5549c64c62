IB/mlx5: Add MR to radix tree in reg_mr_callback

For memory regions that are allocated using reg_umr, the suffix of
mlx5_core_create_mkey isn't being called.  Instead the creation is
completed in a callback function (reg_mr_callback).  This means that
these MRs aren't being added to the MR radix tree.  Add them in the
callback.
