x86, vdso: Move syscall and sysenter setup into kernel/cpu/common.c

This code is used during CPU setup, and it isn't strictly speaking
related to the 32-bit vdso.  It's easier to understand how this
works when the code is closer to its callers.

This also lets syscall32_cpu_init be static, which might save some
trivial amount of kernel text.
