ASoC: atmel-pcm-pdc: Remove broken suspend/resume code

Suspend/resume support for the atmel-pcm-pdc driver was broken in commit
f0fba2ad1 ("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC Multi-Component Support"). It
essentially reverted the modifications done in commit 10cab262 ("ASoC: Change
how suspend and resume obtain the PCM runtime"). The suspend and resume handlers
at the beginning check if dai->runtime is not NULL, but dai->runtime is always
NULL, hence the code never runs. Considering that nobody noticed any problems in
the last 4 years since the code was broken and that the driver does not set
SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME, which means applications are expected to stop and restart
the audio stream during suspend/resume, it is probably safe to assume that his
code is not needed and can be removed.
