ftrace: Write in missing comment from a very old commit

Back in 2011 Commit ed926f9b35cda "ftrace: Use counters to enable
functions to trace" changed the way ftrace accounts for enabled
and disabled traced functions. There was a comment started as:

	/*
	 *
	 */

But never finished. Well, that's rather useless. I probably forgot
to save the file before committing it. And it passed review from all
this time.

Anyway, better late than never. I updated the comment to express what
is happening in that somewhat complex code.
