ARM: 8022/1: ftrace: work with CONFIG_DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX

Make ftrace work with CONFIG_DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX by making module text
writable around the place where ftrace does its work, like it is done on
x86 in the patch which introduced CONFIG_DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX,
84e1c6bb38eb ("x86: Add RO/NX protection for loadable kernel modules").
