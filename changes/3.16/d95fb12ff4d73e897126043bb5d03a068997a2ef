KVM: s390: add lowcore access functions

put_guest_lc, read_guest_lc and write_guest_lc are guest access
functions which shall only be used to access the lowcore of a vcpu.
These functions should be used for e.g. interrupt handlers where no
guest memory access protection facilities, like key or low address
protection, are applicable.

At a later point guest vcpu lowcore access should happen via pinned
prefix pages, so that these pages can be accessed directly via the
kernel mapping. All of these *_lc functions can be removed then.
