serial: cpm_uart: No LF conversion in put_poll_char()

In (c7d44a02a serial_core: Commonalize crlf when working w/ a non open
console port) the core was modified to make the UART poll_put_char()
automatically convert LF to CRLF. This driver's poll_put_char() adds a
CR itself and this was not disabled by the above patch meaning
currently it sends two CR characters.

The code to issue a character is shared by the console write code (where
driver must do LF to CRLF conversion, although it can make use of the
uart_console_write() helper function) and the poll_put_char (where
driver must not do the conversion). For that reason we add a flag rather
than simply rip out the conversion code.
