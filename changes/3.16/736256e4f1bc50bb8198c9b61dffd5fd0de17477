powerpc/xmon: Fix up xmon format strings

There are a couple of places where xmon is using %x to print values that
are unsigned long.

I found this out the hard way recently:

 0:mon> p c000000000d0e7c8 c00000033dc90000 00000000a0000089 c000000000000000
 return value is 0x96300500

Which is calling find_linux_pte_or_hugepte(), the result should be a
kernel pointer. After decoding the page tables by hand I discovered the
correct value was c000000396300500.

So fix up that case and a few others.

We also use a mix of 0x%x, %x and %u to print cpu numbers. So
standardise on 0x%x.
