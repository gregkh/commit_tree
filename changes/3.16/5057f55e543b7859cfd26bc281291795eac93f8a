rcu: Bind RCU grace-period kthreads if NO_HZ_FULL

Currently, RCU binds the grace-period kthreads to the timekeeping
CPU only if CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL_SYSIDLE=y.  This means that these
kthreads must be bound manually when CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL_SYSIDLE=n and
CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y: Otherwise, these kthreads will induce OS jitter on
random CPUs.  Given that we are trying to reduce the amount of manual
tweaking required to make CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y work nicely, this commit
makes this binding happen when CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y, even in cases where
CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL_SYSIDLE=n.
