xen-pciback: Document when we FLR an PCI device.

When the toolstack wants us to drop or add an PCI device it
changes the XenBus state to Configuring - and as result of that
we find out which devices we should still be exporting out and
which ones not. For the ones we don't need anymore we need to
do an PCI reset so that it is ready for the next guest.
