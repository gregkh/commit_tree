clk: sunxi: add PRCM (Power/Reset/Clock Management) clks support

The PRCM (Power/Reset/Clock Management) unit provides several clock
devices:
- AR100 clk: used to clock the Power Management co-processor
- AHB0 clk: used to clock the AHB0 bus
- APB0 clk and gates: used to clk peripherals connected to the APB0 bus

Add support for these clks in a separate driver so that they can be probed
as platform devices instead of registered during early init.
This is needed to be able to probe PRCM MFD subdevices.
