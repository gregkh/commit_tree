libceph: mon_get_version request infrastructure

Add support for mon_get_version requests to libceph.  This reuses much
of the ceph_mon_generic_request infrastructure, with one exception.
Older OSDs don't set mon_get_version reply hdr->tid even if the
original request had a non-zero tid, which makes it impossible to
lookup ceph_mon_generic_request contexts by tid in get_generic_reply()
for such replies.  As a workaround, we allocate a reply message on the
reply path.  This can probably interfere with revoke, but I don't see
a better way.
