staging: comedi: das16: factor out chanlist checking from (*do_cmdtest)

Step 5 of the (*do_cmdtest) validates that the cmd->chanlist is compatible
with the hardware.

For aesthetics, factor out the step 5 code for the analog input async command
support. Tidy up the factored out code.

To minimize the noise, change the dev_err() to dev_dbg().
