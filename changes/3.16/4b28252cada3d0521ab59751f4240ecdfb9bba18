net: Fix GSO constants to match NETIF flags

Joseph Gasparakis reported that VXLAN GSO offload stopped working with
i40e device after recent UDP changes. The problem is that the
SKB_GSO_* bits are out of sync with the corresponding NETIF flags. This
patch fixes that. Also, we add BUILD_BUG_ONs in net_gso_ok for several
GSO constants that were missing to avoid the problem in the future.
