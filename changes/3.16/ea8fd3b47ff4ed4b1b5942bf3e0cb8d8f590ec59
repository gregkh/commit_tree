cgroup: cgroup_apply_cftypes() shouldn't skip the default hierarhcy

cgroup_apply_cftypes() skip creating or removing files if the
subsystem is attached to the default hierarchy, which led to missing
files in the root of the default hierarchy.

Skipping made sense when the default hierarchy was dummy; however, now
that the default hierarchy is full functional and planned to be used
as the unified hierarchy, it shouldn't be skipped over.
