locking/rwsem: Reduce the size of struct rw_semaphore

Recent optimistic spinning additions to rwsem provide significant performance
benefits on many workloads on large machines. The cost of it was increasing
the size of the rwsem structure by up to 128 bits.

However, now that the previous patches in this series bring the overhead of
struct optimistic_spin_queue to 32 bits, this patch reorders some fields in
struct rw_semaphore such that we can reduce the overhead of the rwsem structure
by 64 bits (on 64 bit systems).

The extra overhead required for rwsem optimistic spinning would now be up
to 8 additional bytes instead of up to 16 bytes. Additionally, the size of
rwsem would now be more in line with mutexes.
