ftrace: Add arm64 support to recordmcount

Recordmcount utility under scripts is run, after compiling each object,
to find out all the locations of calling _mcount() and put them into
specific seciton named __mcount_loc.
Then linker collects all such information into a table in the kernel image
(between __start_mcount_loc and __stop_mcount_loc) for later use by ftrace.

This patch adds arm64 specific definitions to identify such locations.
There are two types of implementation, C and Perl. On arm64, only C version
is used to build the kernel now that CONFIG_HAVE_C_RECORDMCOUNT is on.
But Perl version is also maintained.

This patch also contains a workaround just in case where a header file,
elf.h, on host machine doesn't have definitions of EM_AARCH64 nor
R_AARCH64_ABS64. Without them, compiling C version of recordmcount will
fail.
