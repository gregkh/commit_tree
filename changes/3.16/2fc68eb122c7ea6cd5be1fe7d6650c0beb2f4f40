b43: fix frequency reported on G-PHY with /new/ firmware

Support for firmware rev 508+ was added years ago, but we never noticed
it reports channel in a different way for G-PHY devices. Instead of
offset from 2400 MHz it simply passes channel id (AKA hw_value).

So far it was (most probably) affecting monitor mode users only, but
the following recent commit made it noticeable for quite everybody:
