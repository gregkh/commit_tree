PCI: Fix return value from pci_user_{read,write}_config_*()

The PCI user-space config accessors pci_user_{read,write}_config_*() return
negative error numbers, which were introduced by commit 34e3207205ef
("PCI: handle positive error codes").  That patch converted all positive
error numbers from platform-specific PCI config accessors to -EINVAL, which
means the callers don't know anything about the specific cause of the
failure.

The patch fixes the issue by converting the positive PCIBIOS_* error values
to generic negative error numbers with pcibios_err_to_errno().
