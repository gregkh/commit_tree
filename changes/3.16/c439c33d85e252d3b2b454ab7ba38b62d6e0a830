8250_dw: Support all baudrates on baytrail

In the same manner as 8250_pci, 8250_dw needs some
baytrail specific quirks to be used. The reference
clock needs to be adjusted before divided in order
to have the minimum error rate on the baudrate.

The specific byt set termios function is stored in
the driver_data field of the acpi device id via the
dw8250_acpi_desc structure.

Remove the uartclk field which is no longer delivered
as driver data.
