drm/i915: remove extraneous VGA power domain put calls

In recent dmesg logs reported for unrelated issues I noticed some power
domain WARNs caused by the following.

The workaround

    Merge tag 'v3.12' into drm-intel-next

but kept the power domain put calls on the error path.

I think for now we can keep things as-is (not reintroduce the w/a) and just fix
the error path, since
- nobody complained seeing this issue
- according to Ville someone is reworking the VGA arbitration scheme at the
  moment and when that's ready we have to rethink this part anyway

So fix this by just removing the put calls from the error path as well.
