sparc64: fix sparse warnings in aes_glue.c

Fix following warnings:
aes_glue.c:127:16: warning: symbol 'aes128_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
aes_glue.c:139:16: warning: symbol 'aes192_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
aes_glue.c:151:16: warning: symbol 'aes256_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?

Fix by defining the variables static as they are not used outside this file
