ARM: mvebu: initialize mvebu-soc-id earlier

Currently, the mvebu-soc-id logic is initialized through a
core_initcall(). However, we will soon need to know the SoC revision
before booting secondary CPUs, because a workaround affects Armada 375
Z1 steppings, but should not be applied on Armada 375 A0 steppings.

Unfortunately, core_initcall() are called way too late compared to the
SMP initialization. Therefore, the mvebu-soc-id initialization is move
to an early_initcall(), which is called before the SMP initialization.
