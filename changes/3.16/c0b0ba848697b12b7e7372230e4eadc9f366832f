sparc32: fix sparse warnings in smp_32.c

Fix following warnings:
smp_32.c:300:6: warning: symbol 'arch_cpu_pre_starting' was not declared. Should it be static?
smp_32.c:320:6: warning: symbol 'arch_cpu_pre_online' was not declared. Should it be static?
smp_32.c:347:6: warning: symbol 'sparc_start_secondary' was not declared. Should it be static?

Add missing static definition.

This left one warning:
   warning: symbol 'setup_profiling_timer' was not declared.

This is a global symbol that has no declaration in any global header.
