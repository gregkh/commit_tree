rcutorture: Add forward-progress checking for writer

The rcutorture output currently does not distinguish between stalls in
the RCU implementation and stalls in the rcu_torture_writer() kthreads.
This commit therefore adds some diagnostics to help distinguish between
these two conditions, at least for the non-SRCU implementations.  (SRCU
does not provide evidence of update-side forward progress by design.)
