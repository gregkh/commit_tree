sched: Remove remaining dubious usage of "power"

It is better not to think about compute capacity as being equivalent
to "CPU power".  The upcoming "power aware" scheduler work may create
confusion with the notion of energy consumption if "power" is used too
liberally.

This is the remaining "power" -> "capacity" rename for local symbols.
Those symbols visible to the rest of the kernel are not included yet.
