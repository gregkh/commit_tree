uprobes/x86: Don't change the task's state if ->pre_xol() fails

Currently this doesn't matter, the only ->pre_xol() hook can't fail,
but we need to fix arch_uprobe_pre_xol() anyway. If ->pre_xol() fails
we should not change regs->ip/flags, we should just return the error
to make restart actually possible.
