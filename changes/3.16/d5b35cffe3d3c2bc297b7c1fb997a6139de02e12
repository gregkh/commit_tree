ppc476: Enable a linker work around for IBM errata #46

This patch adds an option to enable a work around for an icache bug on
476 that can cause execution of stale instructions when falling
through pages (IBM errata #46). It requires a recent version of
binutils which supports the --ppc476-workaround option.

The work around enables the appropriate linker options and ensures
that all module output sections are aligned to 4K page boundaries. The
work around is only required when building modules.
