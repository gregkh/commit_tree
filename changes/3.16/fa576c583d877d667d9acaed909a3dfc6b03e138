KVM: s390: Introduce helper function for faulting-in a guest page

Rework the function kvm_arch_fault_in_sync() to become a proper helper
function for faulting-in a guest page. Now it takes the guest address as
a parameter and does not ignore the possible error code from gmap_fault()
anymore (which could cause undetected error conditions before).
