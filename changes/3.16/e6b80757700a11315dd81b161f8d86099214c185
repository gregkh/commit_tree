arm, unwind, LLVMLinux: Enable clang to be used for unwinding the stack

Patch to prevent warning of a buggy compiler when using clang and
the ARM_UNWIND option.

Clang defines (at least on the current trunk) GNUC, GNUC_MINOR, and
GNUC_PATCHLEVEL to 4, 2, and 1 respectively.

This version of GCC gets flagged as buggy, but it isn't actually an
issue with clang so the patch will do what it did before unless clang
is defined and then it will not report the GCC version as an issue.
