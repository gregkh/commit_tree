xfs: embedd mru_elem into parent structure

There is no need to do a separate allocation for each mru element, just
embedd the structure into the parent one in the user.  Besides saving
a memory allocation and the infrastructure required for it this also
simplifies the API.

While we do major surgery on xfs_mru_cache.c also de-typedef it and
make struct mru_cache private to the implementation file.
