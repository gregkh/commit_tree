cgroup: don't destroy the default root

The default root is allocated and initialized at boot phase, so we
shouldn't destroy the default root when it's umounted, otherwise
it will lead to disaster.

Just try mount and then umount the default root, and the kernel will
crash immediately.

v2:
- No need to check for CSS_NO_REF in cgroup_get/put(). (Tejun)
- Better call cgroup_put() for the default root in kill_sb(). (Tejun)
- Add a comment.
