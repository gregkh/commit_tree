x86/vdso: Fix vdso_install

"make vdso_install" installs unstripped versions of the vdso objects
for the benefit of the debugger.  This was broken by checkin:

6f121e548f83 x86, vdso: Reimplement vdso.so preparation in build-time C

The filenames are different now, so update the Makefile to cope.

This still installs the 64-bit vdso as vdso64.so.  We believe this
will be okay, as the only known user is a patched gdb which is known
to use build-ids, but if it turns out to be a problem we may have to
add a link.

Inspired by a patch from Sam Ravnborg.
