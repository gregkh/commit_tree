ARC: [SMP] Enable icache coherency

icaches are not snooped hence not cohrent in SMP setups which means
kernel has to do cross core calls to ensure the same.

The leaf routine __ic_line_inv_vaddr() now does cross core calls.

__sync_icache_dcache() is affected due to this:

* local dcache line flushed ahead of remote icache inv requests
* can't disable interrupts anymore, since
      __ic_line_inv_vaddr()->on_each_cpu() can deadlock.
