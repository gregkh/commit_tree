powerpc/powernv: Make it possible to skip the IRQHAPPENED check in power7_nap()

To support split core we need to be able to force all secondaries into
nap, so the core can detect they are idle and do an unsplit.

Currently power7_nap() will return without napping if there is an irq
pending. We want to ignore the pending irq and nap anyway, we will deal
with the interrupt later.
