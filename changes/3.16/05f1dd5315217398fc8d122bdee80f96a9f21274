block: add queue flag for disabling SG merging

If devices are not SG starved, we waste a lot of time potentially
collapsing SG segments. Enough that 1.5% of the CPU time goes
to this, at only 400K IOPS. Add a queue flag, QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE,
which just returns the number of vectors in a bio instead of looping
over all segments and checking for collapsible ones.

Add a BLK_MQ_F_SG_MERGE flag so that drivers can opt-in on the sg
merging, if they so desire.
