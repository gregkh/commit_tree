    drm/i915: don't disable the DP port if the link is lost

we no longer call intel_dp_link_down from generic DP code, but only
from the !HAS_DDI dp encoder functions. hsw/bdw have their own encoder
disabling callback in intel_ddi.c.

Hence the early return is no longer needed and the big comment just
confusing, so let's rip it out. To ensure what we don't accidentally
use this again on ddi encoders add a WARN_ON instead.
