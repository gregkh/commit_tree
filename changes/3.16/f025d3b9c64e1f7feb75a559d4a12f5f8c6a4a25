ASoC: jack: Add support for GPIO descriptor defined jack pins

Allow jack GPIO pins be defined also using GPIO descriptor-based interface
in addition to legacy GPIO numbers. This is done by adding two new fields to
struct snd_soc_jack_gpio: idx and gpiod_dev.

Legacy GPIO numbers are used only when GPIO consumer device gpiod_dev is
NULL and otherwise idx is the descriptor index within the GPIO consumer
device.

New function snd_soc_jack_add_gpiods() is added for typical cases where all
GPIO descriptor jack pins belong to same GPIO consumer device. For other
cases the caller must set the gpiod_dev in struct snd_soc_jack_gpio before
calling snd_soc_jack_add_gpios().
