USB: usb_wwan: do not resume I/O on closing ports

Use tty-port initialised flag rather than private flag to determine when
port is closing down.

Since the tty-port flag is set prior to dropping DTR/RTS (when HUPCL is
set) this avoid submitting the read urbs when resuming the interface in
dtr_rts() only to immediately kill them again in shutdown().
