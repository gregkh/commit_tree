ACPI / PM: Hold ACPI scan lock over the "freeze" sleep state

The "freeze" sleep state suffers from the same issue that was
addressed by commit ad07277e82de (ACPI / PM: Hold acpi_scan_lock over
system PM transitions) for ACPI sleep states, that is, things break
if ->remove() is called for devices whose system resume callbacks
haven't been executed yet.

It also can be addressed in the same way, by holding the ACPI scan
lock over the "freeze" sleep state and PM transitions to and from
that state, but ->begin() and ->end() platform operations for the
"freeze" sleep state are needed for this purpose.

This change has been tested on Acer Aspire S5 with Thunderbolt.
