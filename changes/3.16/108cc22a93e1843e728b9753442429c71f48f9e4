net: filter: test fill/spill of all M[] regs

This test for classic BPF probes stores and load combination
via X on all 16 registers of the scratch memory store. It
initially loads integer 100 and passes this value around
to each register while incrementing it every time, thus we
expect to have 116 as a result. Might be useful for JIT
testing.
