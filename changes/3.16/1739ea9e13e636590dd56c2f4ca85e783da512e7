powerpc: Fix regression of per-CPU DSCR setting

Since commit "efcac65 powerpc: Per process DSCR + some fixes (try#4)"
it is no longer possible to set the DSCR on a per-CPU basis.

The old behaviour was to minipulate the DSCR SPR directly but this is no
longer sufficient: the value is quickly overwritten by context switching.

This patch stores the per-CPU DSCR value in a kernel variable rather than
directly in the SPR and it is used whenever a process has not set the DSCR
itself. The sysfs interface (/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/dscr) is unchanged.

Writes to the old global default (/sys/devices/system/cpu/dscr_default)
now set all of the per-CPU values and reads return the last written value.

The new per-CPU default is added to the paca_struct and is used everywhere
outside of sysfs.c instead of the old global default.
