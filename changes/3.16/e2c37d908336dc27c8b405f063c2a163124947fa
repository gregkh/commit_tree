powerpc: Added PCI MSI support using the HSTA module

The PPC476GTR SoC supports message signalled interrupts (MSI) by writing
to special addresses within the High Speed Transfer Assist (HSTA) module.

This patch adds support for PCI MSI with a new system device. The DMA
window is also updated to allow access to the entire 42-bit address range
to allow PCI devices write access to the HSTA module.
