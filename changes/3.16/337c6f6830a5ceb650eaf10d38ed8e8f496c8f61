Btrfs: ensure btrfs_prev_leaf doesn't miss 1 item

We might have had an item with the previous key in the tree right
before we released our path. And after we released our path, that
item might have been pushed to the first slot (0) of the leaf we
were holding due to a tree balance. Alternatively, an item with the
previous key can exist as the only element of a leaf (big fat item).
Therefore account for these 2 cases, so that our callers (like
btrfs_previous_item) don't miss an existing item with a key matching
the previous key we computed above.
