xhci: Switch only Intel Lynx Point-LP ports to EHCI on shutdown.

Patch "xhci: Switch Intel Lynx Point ports to EHCI on shutdown."
commit c09ec25d3684cad74d851c0f028a495999591279 is not fully correct

It switches both Lynx Point and Lynx Point-LP ports to EHCI on shutdown.
On some Lynx Point machines it causes spurious interrupt,
which wake the system: bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76291

On Lynx Point-LP on the contrary switching ports to EHCI seems to be
necessary to fix these spurious interrupts.
