ARM: dts: kirkwood: resynch 98dx4122 dtsi

The 98DX4122 dtsi file lacks the defintion of the PCIe controller which
is present on this SoC.

The SATA phys must also be explicitely disabled since they are not
present on this SoC. If they remain enabled, a hardlock occures when
their clock gates are enabled.
