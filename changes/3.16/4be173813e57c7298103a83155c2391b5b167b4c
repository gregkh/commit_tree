drm/i915: Reorder semaphore deadlock check

If a semaphore is waiting on another ring, which in turn happens to be
waiting on the first ring, but that second semaphore has been signalled,
we will be able to kick the second ring and so can treat the first ring
as a valid WAIT and not as HUNG.

v2: Be paranoid and cap the potential recursion depth whilst visiting
the semaphore signallers. (Mika)
