usb: host: xhci-plat: add support for the Armada 375/38x XHCI controllers

The Armada 375 and 38x SoCs come with an XHCI controller that requires
some specific initialization related to the MBus windows
configuration. This patch adds the support for this special
configuration as an XHCI quirk executed during probe.

Two new compatible strings are added to identify the Armada 375 and
Armada 38x XHCI controllers, and therefore enable the relevant quirk.
