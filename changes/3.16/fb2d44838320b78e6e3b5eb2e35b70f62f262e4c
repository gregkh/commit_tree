aio: report error from io_destroy() when threads race in io_destroy()

As reported by Anatol Pomozov, io_destroy() fails to report an error when
it loses the race to destroy a given ioctx.  Since there is a difference in
behaviour between the thread that wins the race (which blocks on outstanding
io requests) versus lthe thread that loses (which returns immediately), wire
up a return code from kill_ioctx() to the io_destroy() syscall.
