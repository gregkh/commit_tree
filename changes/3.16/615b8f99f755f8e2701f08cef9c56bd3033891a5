perf tests: Add numeric identifier to evlist_test

In tests/parse-events.c test cases are declared in evlist_test[]
arrays. Elements of arrays are initialized in following pattern:
	[i] = {
 		.name  = ...,
 		.check = ...,
 	},

When perf-test is running with '-v' option, 'i' variable will be
printed for every existing test.

However, we can't add any arch specific tests inside #ifdefs, because it
will create collision between the element number inside #ifdef and the
next one outside.

This patch adds 'id' field in evlist_test, uses it as a test
identifier and removes explicit numbering of array elements. This helps
to number tests with gaps.
