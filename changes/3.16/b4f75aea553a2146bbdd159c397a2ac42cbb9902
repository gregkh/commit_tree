ALSA: hda - verify pin:converter connection on unsol event for HSW and VLV

This patch will verify the pin's coverter selection for an active stream
when an unsol event reports this pin becomes available again after a display
mode change or hot-plug event.

For Haswell+ and Valleyview: display mode change or hot-plug can change the
transcoder:port connection and make all the involved audio pins share the 1st
converter. So the stream using 1st convertor will flow to multiple pins
but active streams using other converters will fail. This workaround
is to assure the pin selects the right conveter and an assigned converter is
not shared by other unused pins.
