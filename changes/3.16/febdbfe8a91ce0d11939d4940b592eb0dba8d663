arch: Prepare for smp_mb__{before,after}_atomic()

Since the smp_mb__{before,after}*() ops are fundamentally dependent on
how an arch can implement atomics it doesn't make sense to have 3
variants of them. They must all be the same.

Furthermore, the 3 variants suggest they're only valid for those 3
atomic ops, while we have many more where they could be applied.

So move away from
smp_mb__{before,after}_{atomic,clear}_{dec,inc,bit}() and reduce the
interface to just the two: smp_mb__{before,after}_atomic().

This patch prepares the way by introducing default implementations in
asm-generic/barrier.h that default to a full barrier and providing
__deprecated inlines for the previous 6 barriers if they're not
provided by the arch.

This should allow for a mostly painless transition (lots of deprecated
warns in the interim).
