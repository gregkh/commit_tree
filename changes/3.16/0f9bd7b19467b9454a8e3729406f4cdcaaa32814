ASoC: dapm: Simplify snd_soc_dapm_link_dai_widgets()

If we find a widget who's stream name matches the name of a DAI widget then
thats the one it should be connected to. Based on the widget id we can say in
which direction the path should be. No need to go back to the DAI and check the
stream names.
