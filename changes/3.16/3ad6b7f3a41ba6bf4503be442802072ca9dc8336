iommu/exynos: Fix L2TLB invalidation

L2TLB is 8-way set-associative TLB with 512 entries. The number of
sets is 64.
A single 4KB(small page) translation information is cached
only to a set whose index is the same with the lower 6 bits of the page
frame number.
A single 64KB(large page) translation information can be
cached to any 16 sets whose top two bits of their indices are the same
with the bit [5:4] of the page frame number.
A single 1MB(section) or larger translation information can be cached to
any set in the TLB.

It is required to invalidate entire sets that may cache the target
translation information to guarantee that the L2TLB has no stale data.
