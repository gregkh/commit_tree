ARM: S3C24XX: convert s3c2440 and s3c2442 to common clock framework

Convert all machines using these cpus to use the ccf clock driver
instead of the legacy Samsung clock implementation.

Some of the more esotheric machines will probably need a fixup, as they
do strange things to the clkout outputs, that I did not really understand
nor have the hardware to check.
