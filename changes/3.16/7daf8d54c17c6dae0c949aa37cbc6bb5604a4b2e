drm/plane-helper: Add drm_plane_helper_check_update() (v3)

Pull the parameter checking from drm_primary_helper_update() out into
its own function; drivers that provide their own setplane()
implementations rather than using the helper may still want to share
this parameter checking logic.

A few of the checks here were also updated based on suggestions by
Ville Syrjälä.

v3:
 - s/primary_helper/plane_helper/ --- this checking logic may be useful
   for other types of planes as well.
 - Fix visibility check (need to dereference visibility pointer)
v2:
 - Pass src/dest/clip rects and min/max scaling down to helper to avoid
   duplication of effort between helper and drivers (suggested by
   Ville).
 - Allow caller to specify whether the primary plane should be
   updatable while the crtc is disabled.
