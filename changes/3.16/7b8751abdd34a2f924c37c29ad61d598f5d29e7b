ASoC: fsl: Remove dependencies of boards for SND_SOC_EUKREA_TLV320

Eukrea-i.MX51 board was converted to use DT, ie we no longer have a
MACH_EUKREA_MBIMXSD51_BASEBOARD symbol.
Transformation of other boards planned for the near future, so this
patch removes all these dependencies and restricts build of this
driver to ARCH_MXC.
