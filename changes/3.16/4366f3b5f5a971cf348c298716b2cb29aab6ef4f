drm/radeon: Bypass hw lut's for > 8 bpc framebuffer scanout.

The hardware lut's only have 256 slots for indexing by a
8 bpc framebuffer. In 10 bpc scanout modes, framebuffer
color values would get truncated to their 8 msb's,
thereby losing the extra precision afforded by a 10 bpc
framebuffer.

To retain full precision, bypass the hw lut in 10 bpc
scanout mode.
