ACPI / video: Add an acpi_video_unregister_backlight function

Add an acpi_video_unregister_backlight function, which only unregisters
the backlight device, and leaves the acpi_notifier in place. Some acpi_vendor
driver need this as they don't want the acpi_video# backlight device, but do
need the acpi-video driver for hotkey handling.

Chances are that this new acpi_video_unregister_backlight() is actually
what existing acpi_vendor drivers have wanted all along. Currently acpi_vendor
drivers which want to disable the acpi_video# backlight device, make 2 calls:

acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor();
acpi_video_unregister();

The intention here is to make things independent of when acpi_video_register()
gets called. As acpi_video_register() will get called on acpi-video load time
on non intel gfx machines, while it gets called on i915 load time on intel
gfx machines.

This leads to the following 2 interesting scenarios:

 a) intel gfx:
  1) acpi-video module gets loaded (as it is a dependency of acpi_vendor
     and i915)
  2) acpi-video does NOT call acpi_video_register()
  3) acpi_vendor loads (lets assume it loads before i915), calls
     acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor(); which sets
     ACPI_VIDEO_BACKLIGHT_DMI_VENDOR
  4) calls acpi_video_unregister -> not registered, nop
  5) i915 loads, calls acpi_video_register
  6) acpi_video_register registers the acpi_notifier for the hotkeys,
     does NOT register a backlight device because of
     ACPI_VIDEO_BACKLIGHT_DMI_VENDOR

 b) non intel gfx
  1) acpi-video module gets loaded (as it is a dependency acpi_vendor)
  2) acpi-video calls acpi_video_register()
  3) acpi_video_register registers the acpi_notifier for the hotkeys,
     and a backlight device
  4) acpi_vendor loads, calls acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor()
  5) calls acpi_video_unregister, this unregisters BOTH the acpi_notifier
     for the hotkeys AND the backlight device

So here we have possibly the same acpi_vendor module, making the same calls,
but with different results, in one cases acpi-video does handle hotkeys,
in the other it does not.

Note that the a) scenario turns into b) if we assume the i915 module loads
before the vendor_acpi module, so we also have different behavior depending
on module loading order!

So as said I believe that quite a few existing acpi_vendor modules really
always want the behavior of a), hence this patch adds a new
acpi_video_unregister_backlight() which gives the behavior of a) independent
of module loading order.
