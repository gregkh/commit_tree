ipv6: Fix regression caused by efe4208 in udp_v6_mcast_next()

Commit efe4208 ("ipv6: make lookups simpler and faster") introduced a
regression in udp_v6_mcast_next(), resulting in multicast packets not
reaching the destination sockets under certain conditions.

The packet's IPv6 addresses are wrongly compared to the IPv6 addresses
from the function's socket argument, which indicates the starting point
for looping, instead of the loop variable. If the addresses from the
first socket do not match the packet's addresses, no socket in the list
will match.
