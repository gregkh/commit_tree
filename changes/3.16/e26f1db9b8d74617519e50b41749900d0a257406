tty/serial: fix generic earlycon option parsing

Commit 9aac5887595 (tty/serial: add generic serial earlycon) moved
console option parsing from 8250_early.c and converted to kstrto*
functions from simple_strtoul along the way. However, kstrto* functions
are not equivalent in that they do not allow non-convertible characters
at the end such as "115200n8". Fix this by changing back to
simple_strtoul and ignore what checkpatch.pl says.
