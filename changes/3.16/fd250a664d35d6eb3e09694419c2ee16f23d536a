sparc: fix sparse warnings in cpu.c

Fix following sparc32 warning:
cpu.c:430:29: warning: symbol 'cpuinfo_op' was not declared. Should it be static?

Fix following sparc64 warnings:
cpu.c:364:14: warning: symbol 'dcache_parity_tl1_occurred' was not declared. Should it be static?
cpu.c:365:14: warning: symbol 'icache_parity_tl1_occurred' was not declared. Should it be static?

Rearrange asm/cpu.h to share more stuff between sparc32 and sparc64.
Added missing include to cpu.c of kernel.h
