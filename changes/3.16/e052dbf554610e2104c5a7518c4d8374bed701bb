hwrng: virtio - ensure reads happen after successful probe

The hwrng core asks for random data in the hwrng_register() call itself
from commit d9e7972619.  This doesn't play well with virtio -- the
DRIVER_OK bit is only set by virtio core on a successful probe, and
we're not yet out of our probe routine when this call is made.  This
causes the host to not acknowledge any requests we put in the virtqueue,
and the insmod or kernel boot process just waits for data to arrive from
the host, which never happens.
