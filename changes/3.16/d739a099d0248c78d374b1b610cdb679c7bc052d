PCI: Don't add disabled subtractive decode bus resources

For a subtractive decode bridge, we previously added and printed all
resources of the primary bus, even if they were not valid.  In the example
below, the bridge 00:1c.3 has no windows enabled, so there are no valid
resources on bus 02.  But since 02:00.0 is subtractive decode bridge, we
add and print all those invalid resources, which don't really make sense:

  pci 0000:00:1c.3: PCI bridge to [bus 02-03]
  pci 0000:02:00.0: PCI bridge to [bus 03] (subtractive decode)
  pci 0000:02:00.0:   bridge window [??? 0x00000000 flags 0x0] (subtractive decode)

Add and print the subtractively-decoded resources only if they are valid.

There's an example in the dmesg log attached to the bugzilla below (but
this patch doesn't fix the bug reported there).
