drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c: drivers/char/rtc.c features for DECstation support

This brings in drivers/char/rtc.c functionality required for DECstation
and, should the maintainers decide to switch, Alpha systems to use
rtc-cmos.

Specifically these features are made available:

* RTC iomem rather than x86/PCI port I/O mapping, controlled with the
  RTC_IOMAPPED macro as with the original driver.  The DS1287A chip in all
  DECstation systems is mapped in the host bus address space as a
  contiguous block of 64 32-bit words of which the least significant byte
  accesses the RTC chip for both reads and writes.  All the address and
  data window register accesses are made transparently by the chipset glue
  logic so that the device appears directly mapped on the host bus.

* A way to set the size of the address space explicitly with the
  newly-added `address_space' member of the platform part of the RTC
  device structure.  This avoids the unreliable heuristics that does not
  work in a setup where the RTC is not explicitly accessed with the usual
  address and data window register pair.

* The ability to use the RTC periodic interrupt as a system clock
  device, which is implemented by arch/mips/kernel/cevt-ds1287.c for
  DECstation systems and takes the RTC interrupt away from the RTC driver.
   Eventually hooking back to the clock device's interrupt handler should
  be possible for the purpose of the alarm clock and possibly also
  update-in-progress interrupt, but this is not done by this change.

  o To avoid interfering with the clock interrupt all the places where
    the RTC interrupt mask is fiddled with are only executed if and IRQ
    has been assigned to the RTC driver.

  o To avoid changing the clock setup Register A is not fiddled with
    if CMOS_RTC_FLAGS_NOFREQ is set in the newly-added `flags' member of
    the platform part of the RTC device structure.  Originally, in
    drivers/char/rtc.c, this was keyed with the absence of the RTC
    interrupt, just like the interrupt mask, but there only the periodic
    interrupt frequency is set, whereas rtc-cmos also sets the divider
    bits.  Therefore a new flag is introduced so that systems where the
    RTC interrupt is not usable rather than used as a system clock device
    can fully initialise the RTC.

* A small clean-up is made to the IRQ assignment code that makes the IRQ
  number hardcoded to -1 rather than arbitrary -ENXIO (or whatever error
  happens to be returned by platform_get_irq) where no IRQ has been
  assigned to the RTC driver (NO_IRQ might be another candidate, but it
  looks like this macro has inconsistent or missing definitions and
  limited use and might therefore be unsafe).

Verified to work correctly with a DECstation 5000/240 system.
