ath10k: fix pmf for action frames

Fix sending and receiveing protected managment frames.
Lack of protected flag for received protected action frames
causes report these frames as unprotected robust action frames.
If the driver in AP mode sent frame with protected flag and
CCMP header using IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_SW_MGMT_TX flag,
the FW encrypted frames once again. From user side all
received SA Query Requests and Responses were skipped and
all protected action frames were sent as malformed packets.
