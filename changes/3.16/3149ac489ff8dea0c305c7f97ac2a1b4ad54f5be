ALSA: bebob: Add support for M-Audio special Firewire series

This commit allows this driver to support some models which M-Audio produces
with DM1000 but its firmware is special. They are:
 - Firewire 1814
 - ProjectMix I/O

They have heavily customized firmware. The usual operations can't be applied to
them. For this reason, this commit adds a model specific member to 'struct
snd_bebob' and some model specific functions. Some parameters are write-only so
this commit also adds control interface for applications to set them.

M-Audio special firmware quirks:
 - Just after powering on, they wait to download firmware. This state is
   changed when receiving cue. Then bus reset is generated and the device is
   recognized as a different model with the uploaded firmware.
 - They don't respond against BridgeCo AV/C extension commands. So drivers
   can't get their stream formations and so on.
 - They do not start to transmit packets only by establishing connection but
   also by receiving SIGNAL FORMAT command.
 - After booting up, they often fail to send response against driver's request
   due to mismatch of gap_count.

This module don't support to upload firmware.
