btrfs: test for valid bdev before kobj removal in btrfs_rm_device

commit 99994cd btrfs: dev delete should remove sysfs entry
added a btrfs_kobj_rm_device, which dereferences device->bdev...
right after we check whether device->bdev might be NULL.

I don't honestly know if it's possible to have a NULL device->bdev
here, but assuming that it is (given the test), we need to move
the kobject removal to be under that test.
