printk: shrink too long messages

We might want to print at least part of too long messages and add some
warning for debugging purpose.

The question is how long the shrunken message should be.  If we use the
whole buffer, it might get rotated too soon.  Let's try to use only 1/4 of
the buffer for now.

Also shrink the whole dictionary.  We do not want to parse it or break it
in the middle of some pair of values.  It would not cause any real harm
but still.
