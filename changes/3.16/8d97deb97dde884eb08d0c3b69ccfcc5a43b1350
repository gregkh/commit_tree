staging/lustre/llite: issue OST_SYNC for fsync()

The last parameter @datasync of fsync() has following indication:
* if datasync=0, we'd always flush data and metadata
* if datasync=1, we'd always flush data while does not flush modifed
  metadata unless that metadata is needed in order to allow a
  subsequent data retrieval to be correctly handled. For example, a
  change to the file size would require a metadata flush.

Lustre client can not tell the difference easily, and would issue
MDS_SYNC and OST_SYNC in all cases.
