of: Check for phys_addr_t overflows in early_init_dt_add_memory_arch

The common early_init_dt_add_memory_arch takes the base and size
of a memory region as u64 types. The function never checks if
the base and size can actually fit in a phys_addr_t which may
be smaller than 64-bits. This may result in incorrect memory
being passed to memblock_add if the memory falls outside the
range of phys_addr_t. Add range checks for the base and size if
phys_addr_t is smaller than u64.
