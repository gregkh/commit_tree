drivers/net/wireless/ti/wl*/spi.c: Simplify CRC computation

These devices require commands stored in buffers in an odd order,
different from that in which the CRC is computed.

Rather than make two copies of the commands in two different orders,
form the commands in logical (CRC) order, append the CRC, then byte-swap
in place to the desired order.

The old code worked fine, I'm just scratching an "ugh, that's ugly"
itch.
