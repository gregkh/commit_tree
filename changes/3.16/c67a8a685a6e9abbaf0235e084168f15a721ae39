memcg, slab: merge memcg_{bind,release}_pages to memcg_{un}charge_slab

Currently we have two pairs of kmemcg-related functions that are called on
slab alloc/free.  The first is memcg_{bind,release}_pages that count the
total number of pages allocated on a kmem cache.  The second is
memcg_{un}charge_slab that {un}charge slab pages to kmemcg resource
counter.  Let's just merge them to keep the code clean.
