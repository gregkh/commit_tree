mm/swapfile.c: delete the "last_in_cluster < scan_base" loop in the body of scan_swap_map()

Via commit ebc2a1a69111 ("swap: make cluster allocation per-cpu"), we
can find that all SWP_SOLIDSTATE "seek is cheap"(SSD case) has already
gone to si->cluster_info scan_swap_map_try_ssd_cluster() route.  So that
the "last_in_cluster < scan_base" loop in the body of scan_swap_map()
has already become a dead code snippet, and it should have been deleted.

This patch is to delete the redundant loop as Hugh and Shaohua
suggested.
