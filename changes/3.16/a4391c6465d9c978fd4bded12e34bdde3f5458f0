blk-mq: bump max tag depth to 10K tags

For some scsi-mq cases, the tag map can be huge. So increase the
max number of tags we support.

Additionally, don't fail with EINVAL if a user requests too many
tags. Warn that the tag depth has been adjusted down, and store
the new value inside the tag_set passed in.
