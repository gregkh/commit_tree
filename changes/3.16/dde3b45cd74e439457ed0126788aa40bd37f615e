HID: hid-sensor-hub: new device id and quirk for STM Sensor hub

Added STM sensor hub new device id. Also added this new device
in HID_SENSOR_HUB_ENUM_QUIRK to fix report descriptors.
These devices uses old FW which uses logical 0 as minimum.
In these, HID reports are not using proper collection classes.
So we need to fix report descriptors,for such devices. This
will not have any impact, if the FW uses logical 1 as minimum.
