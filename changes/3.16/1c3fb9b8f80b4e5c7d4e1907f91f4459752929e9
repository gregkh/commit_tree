rtl8180: fix enabled interrupt mask for rtl8187se

When preparing the bitfield to write to HW register, the high-priority
queue error interrupt bit is set two times, and the beacon queue
TX-OK interrupt is not enabled.

Currently this have no functional impact because the high-priority
queue is not used at all, and the beacon queue is not used yet.

This patch removes high-priority queue bits and it adds the
beacon queue missing bit.
It removes also the management queue bits because it is not used.

This was found by static code analyzer.
