ahci: add support for Hisilicon sata

The hip04 SoC of hisilicon has an AHCI compliant SATA controller,
and it is compliant with the ahci 1.3 and sata 3.0 specification.

There is a wrong bit in HOST_CAP of hip04 sata controller, which
enable unsupported feature of FBS, use AHCI_HFLAG_NO_FBS hflag to
disable it.
