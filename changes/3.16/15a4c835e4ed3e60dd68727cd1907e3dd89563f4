cgroup, memcg: implement css->id and convert css_from_id() to use it

Until now, cgroup->id has been used to identify all the associated
csses and css_from_id() takes cgroup ID and returns the matching css
by looking up the cgroup and then dereferencing the css associated
with it; however, now that the lifetimes of cgroup and css are
separate, this is incorrect and breaks on the unified hierarchy when a
controller is disabled and enabled back again before the previous
instance is released.

This patch adds css->id which is a subsystem-unique ID and converts
css_from_id() to look up by the new css->id instead.  memcg is the
only user of css_from_id() and also converted to use css->id instead.

For traditional hierarchies, this shouldn't make any functional
difference.
