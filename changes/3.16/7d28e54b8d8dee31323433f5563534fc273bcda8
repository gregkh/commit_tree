usb: ohci-exynos: Add facility to use phy provided by the generic phy framework

Add support to consume phy provided by Generic phy framework.
Keeping the support for older usb-phy intact right now, in order
to prevent any functionality break in absence of relevant
device tree side change for ohci-exynos.
Once we move to new phy in the device nodes for ohci, we can
remove the support for older phys.
