igb: separate hardware setting from the set_ts_config ioctl

This patch separates the hardware logic from the set function, so that
we can re-use it during a ptp_reset. This enables the reset to return
functionality to the last known timestamp mode, rather than resetting
the value. We initialize the mode to off during the ptp_init cycle.
