mm/dmapool.c: remove redundant NULL check for dev in dma_pool_create()

"dev" cannot be NULL because it is already checked before calling
dma_pool_create().

If dev ever was NULL, the code would oops in dev_to_node() after enabling
CONFIG_NUMA.

It is possible that some driver is using dev==NULL and has never been run
on a NUMA machine.  Such a driver is probably outdated, possibly buggy and
will need some attention if it starts triggering NULL derefs.
