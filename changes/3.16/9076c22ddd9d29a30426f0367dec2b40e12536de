ALSA: bebob: Add support for M-Audio usual Firewire series

This commit allows this driver to support some models which M-Audio produces
with DM1000/DM1000E with usual firmware. They are:
 - Firewire 410
 - Firewire AudioPhile
 - Firewire Solo
 - Ozonic
 - NRV10
 - FirewireLightBridge

According to a person who worked in BridgeCo, some models are produced with
'Pre-BeBoB'. This means that these products were released before BeBoB was
officially produced, and later BeBoB specification was formed. So these models
have some quirks.

M-Audio usual firmware quirks:
 - Just after powering on, 'Firewire 410' waits to download firmware. This
   state is changed when receiving cue. Then bus reset is generated and the
   device is recognized as a different model with the uploaded firmware.
 - 'Firewire Audiophile' also waits to download firmware but its
   vendor id/model id is the same as the one after loading firmware.
 - The information of channel mapping for MIDI conformant data channel is
   invalid against BridgeCo specification.

This commit adds some codes for these quirks but don't support to upload
firmware.

This commit also adds specific operations to get metering information. The
metering information also includes status of clock synchronization if the model
supports to switch source of clock.

The specification of FirewireLightBridge is unknown. So in this time, normal
operations are applied for this model.
