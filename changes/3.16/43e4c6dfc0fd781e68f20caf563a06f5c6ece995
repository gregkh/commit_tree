net: cdc_ncm: set reasonable padding limits

We pad frames larger than X to maximum size for devices which
don't need a ZLP after maximum sized frames. This allows the
device to optimize its transfers for one fixed buffer size.

X was arbitrarily set at 512 bytes regardless of real buffer
maximum, causing extreme overheads due to excessive padding of
larger tx buffers. Limit the padding to at most 3 full USB
packets, still allowing the overhead to payload ratio of 3/1.
