    drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.

we have contexts everywhere, and so we must be careful to distinguish
fake contexts, which do not have an associated bo, and real ones, which
do. In particular, we now need to be careful not to dereference NULL
pointers.

This is one such example, as the commit highlighted above failed to move
the unpinning of the default ctx object into the real-context-only
branch.
