ext4: Fix block zeroing when punching holes in indirect block files

free_holes_block() passed local variable as a block pointer
to ext4_clear_blocks(). Thus ext4_clear_blocks() zeroed out this local
variable instead of proper place in inode / indirect block. We later
zero out proper place in inode / indirect block but don't dirty the
inode / buffer again which can lead to subtle issues (some changes e.g.
to inode can be lost).
