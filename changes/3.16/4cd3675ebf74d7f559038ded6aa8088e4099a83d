filter: added BPF random opcode

Added a new ancillary load (bpf call in eBPF parlance) that produces
a 32-bit random number. We are implementing it as an ancillary load
(instead of an ISA opcode) because (a) it is simpler, (b) allows easy
JITing, and (c) seems more in line with generic ISAs that do not have
"get a random number" as a instruction, but as an OS call.

The main use for this ancillary load is to perform random packet sampling.
