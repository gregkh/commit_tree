mfd: cros_ec: spi: Calculate delay between transfers correctly

To avoid spamming the EC we calculate the time between the previous
transfer and the current transfer and force a delay if the time delta
is too small.

However, a small miscalculation causes the delay period to be
far too short. Most noticably this impacts commands with a long
turnaround time such as EC firmware reads and writes.
