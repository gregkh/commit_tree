tracing: Break out of tracing_wait_pipe() before wait_pipe() is called

When reading from trace_pipe, if tracing is off but nothing was read
it should block. If something is read and tracing is off, then EOF
is returned. If tracing is on and there's nothing to read, it will block.

But because the check of whether tracing is off and something was read
is done after the block on the pipe, it is hit or miss if the EOF is
returned or not leading to inconsistent behavior.
