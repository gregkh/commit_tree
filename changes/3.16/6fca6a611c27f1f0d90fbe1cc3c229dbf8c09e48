blk-mq: add helper to insert requests from irq context

Both the cache flush state machine and the SCSI midlayer want to submit
requests from irq context, and the current per-request requeue_work
unfortunately causes corruption due to sharing with the csd field for
flushes.  Replace them with a per-request_queue list of requests to
be requeued.

Based on an earlier test by Ming Lei.
