crypto: testmgr - add aead cbc des, des3_ede tests

Test vectors were taken from existing test for
CBC(DES3_EDE). Associated data has been added to test vectors.
HMAC computed with Crypto++ has been used. Following algos have
been covered.

        (a) "authenc(hmac(sha1),cbc(des))"
        (b) "authenc(hmac(sha1),cbc(des3_ede))"
        (c) "authenc(hmac(sha224),cbc(des))"
        (d) "authenc(hmac(sha224),cbc(des3_ede))"
        (e) "authenc(hmac(sha256),cbc(des))"
        (f) "authenc(hmac(sha256),cbc(des3_ede))"
        (g) "authenc(hmac(sha384),cbc(des))"
        (h) "authenc(hmac(sha384),cbc(des3_ede))"
        (i) "authenc(hmac(sha512),cbc(des))"
        (j) "authenc(hmac(sha512),cbc(des3_ede))"
