ALSA: bebob: Add commands and connections/streams management

This commit adds management functionality for connections and streams.
BeBoB uses CMP to manage connections and uses AMDTP for streams.

This commit also adds some BridgeCo's AV/C extension commands. There are some
BridgeCo's AV/C extension commands but this commit just uses below commands
to get device's capability and status:

 1.Extended Plug Info commands
  - Plug Channel Position Specific Data
  - Plug Type Specific Data
  - Cluster(Section) Info Specific Data
  - Plug Input Specific Data
 2.Extended Stream Format Information commands
  - Extended Stream Format Information Command - List Request

For Extended Plug Info commands for Cluster Info Specific Data, I pick up
'section' instead of 'cluster' from document to prevent from misunderstanding
because 'cluster' is also used in IEC 61883-6.
