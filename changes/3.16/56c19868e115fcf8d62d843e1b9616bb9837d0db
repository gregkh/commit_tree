openvswitch: Make flow mask removal symmetric.

Masks are inserted when flows are inserted to the table, so it is
logical to correspondingly remove masks when flows are removed from
the table, in ovs_flow_table_remove().

This allows ovs_flow_free() to be called without locking, which will
be used by later patches.
