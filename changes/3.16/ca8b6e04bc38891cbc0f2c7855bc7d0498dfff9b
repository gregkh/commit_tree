net: via-rhine: Drop revision property, use quirks instead

This adds two new flags to quirks and thus removes the need to carry
revision in rhine_private. As a result, the init logic is simplified
a bit.

This also fixes a compiler warning in OF code on 64bit due to pointer
casting:

        drivers/net/ethernet/via/via-rhine.c: In function ‘rhine_init_one_platform’:
        drivers/net/ethernet/via/via-rhine.c:1132:13: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
          revision = (u32)match->data;
                     ^

That code was added in commit 2d283862dc62daead9db0dc89cd0d0351e91f765
("net: via-rhine: add OF bus binding").

Tested in platform configuration on a VIA WM8950 APC Rock board.
