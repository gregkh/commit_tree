tracing: Allow irq/preempt tracers to be used by instances

The irqsoff, preemptoff and preemptirqsoff tracers can now be used by
instances. But they may only be used by one instance at a time (including
the top level directory). This allows multiple tracers to run while the
irqsoff (and friends) tracer is running simultaneously.
