ALSA: hda - Revert stream assignment order for Intel controllers

We got a regression report for 3.15.x kernels, and this turned out to
be triggered by the fix for stream assignment order.  On reporter's
machine with Intel controller (8086:1e20) + VIA VT1802 codec, the
first playback slot can't work with speaker outputs.

But the original commit was actually a fix for AMD controllers where
no proper GCAP value is returned, we shouldn't revert the whole
commit.  Instead, in this patch, a new flag is introduced to determine
the stream assignment order, and follow the old behavior for Intel
controllers.
