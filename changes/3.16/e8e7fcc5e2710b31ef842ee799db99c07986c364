ARM/ARM64: KVM: Make kvm_psci_call() return convention more flexible

Currently, the kvm_psci_call() returns 'true' or 'false' based on whether
the PSCI function call was handled successfully or not. This does not help
us emulate system-level PSCI functions where the actual emulation work will
be done by user space (QEMU or KVMTOOL). Examples of such system-level PSCI
functions are: PSCI v0.2 SYSTEM_OFF and SYSTEM_RESET.

This patch updates kvm_psci_call() to return three types of values:
1) > 0 (success)
2) = 0 (success but exit to user space)
3) < 0 (errors)
