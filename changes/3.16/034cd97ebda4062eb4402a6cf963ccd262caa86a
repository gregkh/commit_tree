PCI/MSI: Remove pci_enable_msi_block()

There are no users of pci_enable_msi_block() function left.  Obsolete it in
favor of pci_enable_msi_range() and pci_enable_msi_exact() functions.

Previously, we called arch_setup_msi_irqs() once, requesting the same
vector count we passed to arch_msi_check_device().  Now we may call it
several times: if it returns failure, we may retry and request fewer
vectors.

We don't keep track of the vector count we initially passed to
arch_msi_check_device().  We only keep track of the number of vectors
successfully set up by arch_setup_msi_irqs(), and this is what we use to
clean things up when disabling MSI.  Therefore, we assume that
arch_msi_check_device() does nothing that will have to be cleaned up later.
