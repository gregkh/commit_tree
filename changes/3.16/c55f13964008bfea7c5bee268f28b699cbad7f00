Btrfs: fix deadlock when mounting a degraded fs

The deadlock happened when we mount degraded filesystem, the reproduced
steps are following:
 # mkfs.btrfs -f -m raid1 -d raid1 <dev0> <dev1>
 # echo 1 > /sys/block/`basename <dev0>`/device/delete
 # mount -o degraded <dev1> <mnt>

The reason was that the counter -- bi_remaining was wrong. If the missing
or unwriteable device was the last device in the mapping array, we would
not submit the original bio, so we shouldn't increase bi_remaining of it
in btrfs_end_bio(), or we would skip the final endio handle.

Fix this problem by adding a flag into btrfs bio structure. If we submit
the original bio, we will set the flag, and we increase bi_remaining counter,
or we don't.

Though there is another way to fix it -- decrease bi_remaining counter of the
original bio when we make sure the original bio is not submitted, this method
need add more check and is easy to make mistake.
