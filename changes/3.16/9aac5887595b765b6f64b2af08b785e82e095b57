tty/serial: add generic serial earlycon

This introduces generic earlycon infrastructure for serial devices
based on the 8250 earlycon. This allows for supporting earlycon option
with other serial devices. The earlycon output is enabled at the time
early_params are processed.

Only architectures that have fixmap support or have functional ioremap
when early_params are processed are supported. This is the same
restriction that the 8250 driver had.
