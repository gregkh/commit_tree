KVM: s390: Fix external interrupt interception

The external interrupt interception can only occur in rare cases, e.g.
when the PSW of the interrupt handler has a bad value. The old handler
for this interception simply ignored these events (except for increasing
the exit_external_interrupt counter), but for proper operation we either
have to inject the interrupts manually or we should drop to userspace in
case of errors.
