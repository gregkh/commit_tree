mlx4: mark napi id for gro_skb

Napi id was not marked for gro_skb, this will lead rx busy loop won't
work correctly since they stack never try to call low latency receive
method because of a zero socket napi id. Fix this by marking napi id
for gro_skb.

The transaction rate of 1 byte netperf tcp_rr gets about 50% increased
(from 20531.68 to 30610.88).
