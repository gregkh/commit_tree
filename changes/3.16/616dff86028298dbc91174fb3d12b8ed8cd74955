KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Handle Facility interrupt and FSCR

POWER8 introduced a new interrupt type called "Facility unavailable interrupt"
which contains its status message in a new register called FSCR.

Handle these exits and try to emulate instructions for unhandled facilities.
Follow-on patches enable KVM to expose specific facilities into the guest.
