x86, vdso: Remove one final use of htole16()

One final use of the macros from <endian.h> which are not available on
older system.  In this case we had one sole case of *writing* a
littleendian number, but the number is SHN_UNDEF which is the constant
zero, so rather than dealing with the general case of littleendian
puts here, just document that the constant is zero and be done with
it.
