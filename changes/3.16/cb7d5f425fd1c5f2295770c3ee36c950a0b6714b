clk: sunxi: avoid double DT matching

Use for_each_matching_node_and_match instead of for_each_matching_node plus
of_match_node to avoid searching the DT twice for each node.

The sunxi DT scanning code should really be re-worked rather than have
its own private matching infrastructure. It is working around needing a
function pointer and a data pointer for each compatible match.
