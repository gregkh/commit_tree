hwrng: Fix a few driver dependencies and defaults

HW_RANDOM_ATMEL should not only default to ARCH_AT91, it should depend
on it. This driver is useless on other architectures.

Likewise, HW_RANDOM_EXYNOS should depend on ARCH_EXYNOS, as it it
useless on other architectures.

Also set the default to HW_RANDOM for the few architecture-specific
drivers which didn't have it yet, for consistency.
