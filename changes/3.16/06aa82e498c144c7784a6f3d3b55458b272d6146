serial: uart: add hw flow control support configuration

8250 uart driver currently supports only software assisted hw flow
control. The software assisted hw flow control maintains a hw_stopped
flag in the tty structure to stop and start transmission and use modem
status interrupt for the event to drive the handshake signals. This is
not needed if hw has flow control capabilities. This patch adds a
DT attribute for enabling hw flow control for a uart port. Also skip
stop and start if this flag is present in flag field of the port
structure.
