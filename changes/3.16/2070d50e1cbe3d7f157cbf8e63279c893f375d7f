percpu-refcount: rename percpu_ref_tryget() to percpu_ref_tryget_live()

percpu_ref_tryget() is different from the usual tryget semantics in
that it fails if the refcnt is in its dying stage even if the refcnt
hasn't reached zero yet.  We're about to introduce the more
conventional tryget and the current one has only one user.  Let's
rename it to percpu_ref_tryget_live() so that it explicitly signifies
the peculiarities of its semantics.

This is pure rename.
