printk: enable interrupts before calling console_trylock_for_printk()

We need interrupts disabled when calling console_trylock_for_printk()
only so that cpu id we pass to can_use_console() remains valid (for
other things console_sem provides all the exclusion we need and
deadlocks on console_sem due to interrupts are impossible because we use
down_trylock()).  However if we are rescheduled, we are guaranteed to
run on an online cpu so we can easily just get the cpu id in
can_use_console().

We can lose a bit of performance when we enable interrupts in
vprintk_emit() and then disable them again in console_unlock() but OTOH
it can somewhat reduce interrupt latency caused by console_unlock()
especially since later in the patch series we will want to spin on
console_sem in console_trylock_for_printk().
