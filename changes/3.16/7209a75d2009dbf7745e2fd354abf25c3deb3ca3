x86_64/entry/xen: Do not invoke espfix64 on Xen

This moves the espfix64 logic into native_iret.  To make this work,
it gets rid of the native patch for INTERRUPT_RETURN:
INTERRUPT_RETURN on native kernels is now 'jmp native_iret'.

This changes the 16-bit SS behavior on Xen from OOPSing to leaking
some bits of the Xen hypervisor's RSP (I think).

[ hpa: this is a nonzero cost on native, but probably not enough to
  measure. Xen needs to fix this in their own code, probably doing
  something equivalent to espfix64. ]
