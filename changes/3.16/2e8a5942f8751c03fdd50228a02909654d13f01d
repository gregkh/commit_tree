ARM: mvebu: Split low level functions to manipulate HW coherency

Actually enabling coherency and adding a CPU on a SMP group are two
different operations which can be done separately. This patch splits
this in two functions.

Moreover as they use common pattern, this patch also creates local low
level functions (ll_get_coherency_base and ll_get_cpuid) to be used by
the exposed functions (ll_add_cpu_to_smp_group and
ll_enable_coherency)
