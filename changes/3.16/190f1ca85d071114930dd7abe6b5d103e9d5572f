arm64: add support for kernel mode NEON in interrupt context

This patch modifies kernel_neon_begin() and kernel_neon_end(), so
they may be called from any context. To address the case where only
a couple of registers are needed, kernel_neon_begin_partial(u32) is
introduced which takes as a parameter the number of bottom 'n' NEON
q-registers required. To mark the end of such a partial section, the
regular kernel_neon_end() should be used.
