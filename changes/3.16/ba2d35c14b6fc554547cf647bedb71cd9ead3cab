[media] v4l2-ioctl.c: fix sparse __user-related warnings

Fix the use of __user in the check_array_args() prototype: instead of
using 'void * __user *' you should use 'void __user **' for sparse to
understand this correctly.

This also required the use of __force in the '*kernel_ptr = user_ptr'
assignment.

Also replace a wrong cast (void *) with the correct one (void **)
in check_array_args().

This fixes these sparse warnings:
