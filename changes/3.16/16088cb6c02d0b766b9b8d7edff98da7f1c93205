ASoC: Fix wrong argument for card remove callbacks

The commit [e1d4d3c8: ASoC: free jack GPIOs before the sound card is
freed] introduced snd_soc_card remove callbacks to a few drivers, but
they are implemented with a wrong argument type.  The callback should
receive snd_soc_card pointer instead of snd_soc_pcm_runtime.
