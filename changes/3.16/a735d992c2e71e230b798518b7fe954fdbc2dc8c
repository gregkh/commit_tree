ASoC: max98090: Move microphone bias voltage setting to probe function

Microphone bias level configuration register can configure voltage between
2.2 V and 2.8 V but doesn't manage is voltage on or off. Microphone bias
on/off state is controlled by "MICBIAS" DAPM widget.

Therefore there is no need to update bias voltage conditionally depending on
jack state each time when codec goes to SND_SOC_BIAS_ON state and setting
can be moved to max98090_probe() as driver currently doesn't support other
levels than 2.8 V.
