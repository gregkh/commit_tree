ARM: mvebu: add a coherency_available() call

This commit extends the coherency fabric code to provide a
coherency_available()function that the SoC code can call to be told
whether coherency support is available or not. On Armada 370/XP,
coherency support is available as soon as the relevant DT node is
present. On some upcoming SoCs, the DT node needs to be present *and*
the system running with CONFIG_SMP enabled.
