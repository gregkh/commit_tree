drm/i915: Make primary_enabled match the actual hardware state

The BIOS can enable a pipe but leave the primary plane disabled. This
coflicts with out current idea of primary_enabled. Read the actual
hardware plane state and set primary_enabled appropriately.

We currently assume that primary_enabled is always true when we're about
to disable a crtc. That needs to change now as the plane may not be
enabled. So replace the relevant WARNs with early returns in
intel_{enable,disable}_primary_hw_plane().

Fixes the following warning
[    3.831602] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1112 at linux/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_display.c:1918 intel_disable_primary_hw_plane+0xe4/0xf0 [i915]()
