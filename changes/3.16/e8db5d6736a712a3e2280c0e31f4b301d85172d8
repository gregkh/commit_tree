While dealing with this problem, I found another problem that also
results in a kernel crash on thermal module removal:

Subject: [PATCH] thermal: hwmon: Make the check for critical temp valid consistent

We used the tz->ops->get_crit_temp && !tz->ops->get_crit_temp(tz, temp)
to decide if we need to create the temp_crit attribute file but we just
check if tz->ops->get_crit_temp exists to decide if we need to remove
that attribute file. Some ACPI thermal zone doesn't have a valid critical
trip point and that would result in removing a non-existent device file
on thermal module unload.
