ARM: dts: kirkwood: add kirkwood-km_fixedeth DTS file

Besides our Kirkwood Reference design, there is another group of board
on which the eth interface is not connected to a phy but to a switch for
some board internal communication. For these designs, the memory also is
raised to 256MB.

The configuration of the switch is handled by an EEPROM or by the
bootloader, but on the kirkwood side, the port is always configured as
1000 Mbits, full duplex.
