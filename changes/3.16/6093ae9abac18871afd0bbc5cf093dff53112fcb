openvswitch: Minimize dp and vport critical sections.

Move most memory allocations away from the ovs_mutex critical
sections.  vport allocations still happen while the lock is taken, as
changing that would require major refactoring. Also, vports are
created very rarely so it should not matter.

Change ovs_dp_cmd_get() now only takes the rcu_read_lock(), rather
than ovs_lock(), as nothing need to be changed.  This was done by
ovs_vport_cmd_get() already.
