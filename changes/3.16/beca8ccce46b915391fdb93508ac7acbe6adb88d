clk: berlin: add driver for BG2x audio/video PLL

This is a driver for the AVPLLs built upon a VCO with 8 channels each
found on Marvell Berlin2 SoCs. While both VCOs found on BG2/BG2CD share
the same register set, sometimes registers shifts for one of the VCOs
are a bit off. Nothing serious that should require a separate driver,
so deal with both VCOs in a single driver instead.
