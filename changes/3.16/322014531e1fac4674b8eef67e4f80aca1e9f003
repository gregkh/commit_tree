MIPS: Malta: CPS SMP by default

The CONFIG_MIPS_CPS SMP implementation should be able to handle all
cases the CONFIG_MIPS_CMP implementation does, but without requiring
bootloader assistance. It is also required in order to make use of
features such as hotplug & cpuidle core power gating. Enable it by
default for Malta configs that previously enabled the now deprecated
CONFIG_MIPS_CMP, and disable the latter. The local version suffix "cmp"
is removed rather than replaced with "cps" since there are other ways to
tell that the CPS SMP implementation is in use (the "VPE topology" line
in the boot log being one).
