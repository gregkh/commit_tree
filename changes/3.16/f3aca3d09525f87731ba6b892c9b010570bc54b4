nmi: provide the option to issue an NMI back trace to every cpu but current

Sometimes it is preferred not to use the trigger_all_cpu_backtrace()
routine when one wants to avoid capturing a back trace for current.  For
instance if one was previously captured recently.

This patch provides a new routine namely
trigger_allbutself_cpu_backtrace() which offers the flexibility to issue
an NMI to every cpu but current and capture a back trace accordingly.

Patch x86 and sparc to support new routine.

[dzickus@redhat.com: add stub in #else clause]
[dzickus@redhat.com: don't print message in single processor case, wrap with get/put_cpu based on Oleg's suggestion]
