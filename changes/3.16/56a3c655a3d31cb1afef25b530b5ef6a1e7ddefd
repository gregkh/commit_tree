memory-hotplug: update documentation to hide information about SECTIONS and remove end_phys_index

Seems we all agree that information about SECTION, e.g. section size,
sections per memory block should be kept as kernel internals, and not
exposed to userspace.

This patch updates Documentation/memory-hotplug.txt to refer to memory
blocks instead of memory sections where appropriate and added a
paragraph to explain that memory blocks are made of memory sections.
The documentation update is mostly provided by Nathan.

Also, as end_phys_index in code is actually not the end section id, but
the end memory block id, which should always be the same as phys_index.
So it is removed here.
