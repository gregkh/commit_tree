ARM: mvebu: improve PMSU driver to request its resource

Until now, the PMSU driver was using of_iomap() to map its registers,
but of_iomap() doesn't call request_mem_region(). This commit fixes
the memory mapping code of the PMSU to do so, which will also be
useful for a later commit since we will need to adjust the resource
base address and size for Device Tree backward compatibility.
