KVM: s390: make cmma usage conditionally

When userspace reset the guest without notifying kvm, the CMMA state
of the pages might be unused, resulting in guest data corruption.
To avoid this, CMMA must be enabled only if userspace understands
the implications.

CMMA must be enabled before vCPU creation. It can't be switched off
once enabled.  All subsequently created vCPUs will be enabled for
CMMA according to the CMMA state of the VM.
