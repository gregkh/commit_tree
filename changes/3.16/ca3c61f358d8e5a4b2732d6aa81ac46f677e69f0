drivers: uio_dmem_genirq: Fix memory leak in uio_dmem_genirq_probe()

When platform_get_irq() is failed after "priv" allocated,
it need to free "priv". But the label of bad0 doesn't try
to free about "priv". So this patch changes that lable to "bad1".
But "bad1" has pm_runtime_disable() call, this function should
be called when uio_register_device() is failed. So it is moved
into handling error for uio_register_device().
