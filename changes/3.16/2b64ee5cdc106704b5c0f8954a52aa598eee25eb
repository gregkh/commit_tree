xfs: refactor xfs_difree() inobt bits into xfs_difree_inobt() helper

Refactor xfs_difree() in preparation for the finobt. xfs_difree()
performs the validity checks against the ag and reads the agi
header. The work of physically updating the inode allocation btree
is pushed down into the new xfs_difree_inobt() helper.
