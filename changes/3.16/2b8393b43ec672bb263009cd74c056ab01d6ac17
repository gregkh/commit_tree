blk-mq: add timer in blk_mq_start_request

This way will become consistent with non-mq case, also
avoid to update rq->deadline twice for mq.

The comment said: "We do this early, to ensure we are on
the right CPU.", but no percpu stuff is used in blk_add_timer(),
so it isn't necessary. Even when inserting from plug list, there
is no such guarantee at all.
