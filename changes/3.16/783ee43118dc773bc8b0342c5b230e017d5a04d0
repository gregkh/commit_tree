efi-pstore: Fix an overflow on 32-bit builds

In generic_id the long int timestamp is multiplied by 100000 and needs
an explicit cast to u64.

Without that the id in the resulting pstore filename is wrong and
userspace may have problems parsing it, but more importantly files in
pstore can never be deleted and may fill the EFI flash (brick device?).
This happens because when generic pstore code wants to delete a file,
it passes the id to the EFI backend which reinterpretes it and a wrong
variable name is attempted to be deleted.  There's no error message but
after remounting pstore, deleted files would reappear.
