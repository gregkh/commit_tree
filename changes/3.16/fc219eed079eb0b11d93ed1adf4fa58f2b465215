wil6210: limit fw error recovery attempts

In case there is something fundamentally wrong with the firmware
(example: RF cable disconnected), FW will always crash immediately
after reset. This leads to infinite fw error recovery loop.

Count consecutive unsuccessful error recovery attempts in a short period
of time, and stop doing recovery after some reasonable count.
It is still possible to manually reset fw doing
interface down/up sequence.
