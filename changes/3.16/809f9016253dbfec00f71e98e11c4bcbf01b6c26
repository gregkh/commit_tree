Btrfs: make sure we retry if page is a retriable exception

In inode.c:btrfs_page_exists_in_range(), if the page we get from the
radix tree is an exception which should make us retry, set page to
NULL in order to really retry, because otherwise we don't get another
loop iteration executed (page != NULL makes the while loop exit).
This also was making us call page_cache_release after exiting the loop,
which isn't correct because page doesn't point to a valid page, and
possibly return true from the function when we shouldn't.
