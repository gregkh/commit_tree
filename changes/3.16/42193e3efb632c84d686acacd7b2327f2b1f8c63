can: unify identifiers to ensure unique include processing

Armin pointed me to the fact that the identifier which is used to ensure the
unique include processing in lunux/include/uapi/linux/can.h is CAN_H.
This clashed with his own source as includes from libraries and APIs should
use an underscore '_' at the identifier start.

This patch fixes the protection identifiers in all CAN relavant includes.
