perf tools: Add automatic remapping of Android libraries

This patch automatically adjusts the path of MMAP records
associated with Android system libraries.

The Android system is organized with system libraries found in
/system/lib and user libraries in /data/app-lib. On the host system
(not running Android), system libraries can be found in the downloaded
NDK directory under ${NDK_ROOT}/platforms/${APP_PLATFORM}/arch-${ARCH}/usr/lib
and the user libraries are installed under libs/${APP_ABI} within
the apk build directory. This patch makes running the reporting
tools possible on the host system using the libraries from the NDK.
