cfg80211: send events when devices are added/removed

We're currently sending NEW_WIPHY events for renames (which
is a bit odd, but now can't be changed), but also send them
for really new devices that register.

Also send DEL_WIPHY events when a device is removed, the
event ID for this was already reserved.
