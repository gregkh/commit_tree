ARM: l2c: group implementation specific code together

Back in the mists of time, someone decided that it would be a good idea
to group like functions together - so all the save functions in one
place, all the resume functions in another, all the OF parsing functions
some place else.

This makes it difficult to get an overview on what a particular
implementation is doing - grouping an implementations specific functions
together makes more sense, because you can see what it's doing without
the clutter of other implementations.

Organise it according to implementation.
