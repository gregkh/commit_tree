ahci: imx: manage only sata_ref_clk in imx_sata_enable[disable]

Doing suspend/resume on imx6q and imx53 boards with no SATA disk
attached will trigger the following warning.

The reason is that the SATA controller has no working clock at this
point, and thus ahci_enable_ahci() fails to enable the controller.  In
case that there is no SATA disk attached, the imx_sata_disable() gets
called in ahci_imx_error_handler(), and both sata_clk and sata_ref_clk
will be disabled there.  Because all the imx_sata_enable() calls
afterward will return immediately due to imxpriv->no_device check, the
SATA controller working clock sata_clk will never get any chance to be
enabled again.

This is a regression caused by commit 90870d79d4f2 (ahci-imx: Port to
library-ised ahci_platform).  Before the commit, only sata_ref_clk is
managed by the driver in enable/disable function.  But after the commit,
all the clocks are enabled/disabled in a row by ahci platform helpers
ahci_platform_enable[disable]_clks.  Since ahb_clk is a bus clock which
does not have gate at all, and i.MX low-power hardware module already
manages sata_clk across suspend/resume cycle, the only clock that needs
to be managed by software is sata_ref_clk.

So instead of using ahci_platform_enable[disable]_clks to manage all
the clocks in a row from imx_sata_enable[disable], we should manage
only sata_ref_clk in there.
