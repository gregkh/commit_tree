mac80211: improve find_chanctx() for reservations

This allows new vifs to be assigned to a chanctx
as long as chanctx's reservation chandefs (if any)
and chanctx's current chandef (implied by assigned
vifs at the time, if any) and the new vif chandef
are all compatible.

This implies it is impossible to assign a new vif
to an in-place reservation chanctx.

This gives no advantages for single-channel
hardware. It makes sense for multi-channel
hardware only.
