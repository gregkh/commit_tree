tracing: Move locking of trace_cmdline_lock into start/stop seq calls

With the conversion of the saved_cmdlines output to use seq_read, there
is now a race between accessing the values of the saved_cmdlines and
the writing to them. The trace_cmdline_lock needs to be taken at
the start and stop of the seq calls.

A new __trace_find_cmdline() call is created to allow for the look up
to happen without taking the lock.

Fixes: 42584c81c5ad tracing: Have saved_cmdlines use the seq_read infrastructure
