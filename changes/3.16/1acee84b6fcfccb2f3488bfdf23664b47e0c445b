mmc: jz4740: don't wait for PRG_DONE after stop command with R1 response

As of commit bcc3e1726d ("mmc: block: Use R1 responses for stop cmds for
read requests"), stop commands for reads do not have MMC_RSP_BUSY set.
In this case we should not wait for a PRG_DONE IRQ after sending the
stop command: it will not get raised when the busy flag is not set,
causing the request to fail with a timeout.
