tracing: Fix graph tracer with stack tracer on other archs

Running my ftrace tests on PowerPC, it failed the test that checks
if function_graph tracer is affected by the stack tracer. It was.
Looking into this, I found that the update_function_graph_func()
must be called even if the trampoline function is not changed.
This is because archs like PowerPC do not support ftrace_ops being
passed by assembly and instead uses a helper function (what the
trampoline function points to). Since this function is not changed
even when multiple ftrace_ops are added to the code, the test that
falls out before calling update_function_graph_func() will miss that
the update must still be done.

Call update_function_graph_function() for all calls to
update_ftrace_function()
