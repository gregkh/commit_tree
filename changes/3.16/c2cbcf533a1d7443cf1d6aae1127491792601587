powerpc/module: Fix TOC symbol CRC

The commit 71ec7c55ed91 introduced the magic symbol ".TOC." for ELFv2 ABI.
This symbol is built manually and has no CRC value computed. A zero value
is put in the CRC section to avoid modpost complaining about a missing CRC.
Unfortunately, this breaks the kernel module loading when the kernel is
relocated (kdump case for instance) because of the relocation applied to
the kcrctab values.

This patch compute a CRC value for the TOC symbol which will match the one
compute by the kernel when it is relocated - aka '0 - relocate_start' done in
maybe_relocated called by check_version (module.c).
