staging: comedi: adv_pci1710: absorb pci171x_ai_docmd_and_mode()

This helper function is called by the ai (*do_cmd) to setup and
start the async command based on the "mode" of operation. This
"mode" is determined by the cmd convert_src and start_src.

Move this "mode" determination and combine the functions.
