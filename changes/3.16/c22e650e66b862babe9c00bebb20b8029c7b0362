of: Make of_find_node_by_path() handle /aliases

Make of_find_node_by_path() handle aliases as prefixes. To make this
work the name search is refactored to search by path component instead
of by full string. This should be a more efficient search, and it makes
it possible to start a search at a subnode of a tree.
