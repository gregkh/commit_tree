Input: sun4i-ts - add support for temperature sensor

The sun4i resisitive touchscreen controller also comes with a built-in
temperature sensor. This commit adds support for it.

This commit also introduces a new "ts-attached" device-tree property,
when this is not set, the input part of the driver won't register. This way
the internal temperature sensor can be used to measure the SoC temperature
independent of there actually being a touchscreen attached to the controller.
