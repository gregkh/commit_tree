mm/process_vm_access: move config option into init/Kconfig

CONFIG_CROSS_MEMORY_ATTACH adds couple syscalls: process_vm_readv and
process_vm_writev, it's a kind of IPC for copying data between processes.
Currently this option is placed inside "Processor type and features".

This patch moves it into "General setup" (where all other arch-independed
syscalls and ipc features are placed) and changes prompt string to less
cryptic.
