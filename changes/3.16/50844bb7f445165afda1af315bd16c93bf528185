e1000e: Fix expand setting EEE link info to all affected parts

Previously, the update_phy_task was only calling e1000_set_eee_pchlan()
for phy.type 82579.  This patch is to cause this function to be called
for 82579 and newer phy.types.  This causes the dev_spec->eee_lp_ability
to have the correct value when going into SX states.
