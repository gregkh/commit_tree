i40evf: don't use RESETTING state during reinit

The RESETTING state means that a Catastrophic Hardware Bad Thing is
happening and the driver need to tiptoe around and not use the admin
queue or registers or anything like that.

On the other hand, a reinit is no big deal and we can use the admin
queue, and we should. So don't set the state to RESETTING here.

This fixes a Tx hang and FW crash that happens after setting the MTU on
a VF.
