tools/liblockdep: Fix comparison of a boolean value with a value of 2

Comparison of a boolean value (!__init_state) with a value of 2 (done)
as currently happens in the code is unlikely to succeed and causes
repeated initialization of the pthread function pointers.

Instead, remove boolean comparison so that we would initialize said
function pointers only once.
