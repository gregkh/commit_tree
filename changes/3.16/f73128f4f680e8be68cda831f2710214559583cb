powerpc/kvm: Remove redundant save of SIER AND MMCR2

These two registers are already saved in the block above. Aside from
being unnecessary, by the time we get down to the second save location
r8 no longer contains MMCR2, so we are clobbering the saved value with
PMC5.

MMCR2 primarily consists of counter freeze bits. So restoring the value
of PMC5 into MMCR2 will most likely have the effect of freezing
counters.
