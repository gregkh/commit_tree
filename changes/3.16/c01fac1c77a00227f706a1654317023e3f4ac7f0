ath9k: fix aggregation session lockup

If an aggregation session fails, frames still end up in the driver queue
with IEEE80211_TX_CTL_AMPDU set.
This causes tx for the affected station/tid to stall, since
ath_tx_get_tid_subframe returning packets to send.

Fix this by clearing IEEE80211_TX_CTL_AMPDU as long as no aggregation
session is running.
