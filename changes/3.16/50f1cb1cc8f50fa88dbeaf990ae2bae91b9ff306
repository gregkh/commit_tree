net: cdc_ncm: use sane defaults for rx/tx buffers

Lots of devices request much larger buffers than reasonable. This
cause real problems for users of hosts with limited resources.

Reducing the default buffer size to 16kB for such devices is
a reasonable trade-off between allowing them to aggregate traffic
and avoiding memory exhaustion on resource restrained hosts.
