locking/rwsem: Rename 'activity' to 'count'

There are two definitions of struct rw_semaphore, one in linux/rwsem.h
and one in linux/rwsem-spinlock.h.

For some reason they have different names for the initial field. This
makes it impossible to use C99 named initialization for
__RWSEM_INITIALIZER() -- or we have to duplicate that entire thing
along with the structure definitions.

The simpler patch is renaming the rwsem-spinlock variant to match the
regular rwsem.

This allows us to switch to C99 named initialization.
