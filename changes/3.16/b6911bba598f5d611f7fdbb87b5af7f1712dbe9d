MIPS: Malta: add suspend state entry code

This patch introduces code which will enter a suspend state via the
PIIX4. This can only be done when PCI support is enabled since it
requires access to PCI I/O space and the generation of a special cycle
on the PCI bus. In cases where PCI is disabled the mips_pm_suspend
function will simply always return an error.
