IB/umad: Fix error handling

Avoid leaking a kref count in ib_umad_open() if port->ib_dev == NULL
or if nonseekable_open() fails.

Avoid leaking a kref count, that sm_sem is kept down and also that the
IB_PORT_SM capability mask is not cleared in ib_umad_sm_open() if
nonseekable_open() fails.

Since container_of() never returns NULL, remove the code that tests
whether container_of() returns NULL.

Moving the kref_get() call from the start of ib_umad_*open() to the
end is safe since it is the responsibility of the caller of these
functions to ensure that the cdev pointer remains valid until at least
when these functions return.
