/proc/stat: convert to single_open_size()

These two patches are supposed to "fix" failed order-4 memory
allocations which have been observed when reading /proc/stat.  The
problem has been observed on s390 as well as on x86.

To address the problem change the seq_file memory allocations to
fallback to use vmalloc, so that allocations also work if memory is
fragmented.

This approach seems to be simpler and less intrusive than changing
/proc/stat to use an interator.  Also it "fixes" other users as well,
which use seq_file's single_open() interface.

This patch (of 2):

Use seq_file's single_open_size() to preallocate a buffer that is large
enough to hold the whole output, instead of open coding it.  Also
calculate the requested size using the number of online cpus instead of
possible cpus, since the size of the output only depends on the number
of online cpus.
