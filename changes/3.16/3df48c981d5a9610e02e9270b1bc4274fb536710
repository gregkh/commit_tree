powerpc/perf: Ensure all EBB register state is cleared on fork()

In commit 330a1eb "Core EBB support for 64-bit book3s" I messed up
clear_task_ebb(). It clears some but not all of the task's Event Based
Branch (EBB) registers when we duplicate a task struct.

That allows a child task to observe the EBBHR & EBBRR of its parent,
which it should not be able to do.

Fix it by clearing EBBHR & EBBRR.
