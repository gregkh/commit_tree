x86/vdso: Hack to keep 64-bit Go programs working

The Go runtime has a buggy vDSO parser that currently segfaults.
This writes an empty SHT_DYNSYM entry that causes Go's runtime to
malfunction by thinking that the vDSO is empty rather than
malfunctioning by running off the end and segfaulting.

This affects x86-64 only as far as we know, so we do not need this for
the i386 and x32 vdsos.
