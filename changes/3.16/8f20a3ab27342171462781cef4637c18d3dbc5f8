KVM: PPC: E500: Add dcbtls emulation

The dcbtls instruction is able to lock data inside the L1 cache.

We don't want to give the guest actual access to hardware cache locks,
as that could influence other VMs on the same system. But we can tell
the guest that its locking attempt failed.

By implementing the instruction we at least don't give the guest a
program exception which it definitely does not expect.
