nfsd4: use recall_lock for delegation hashing

This fixes a bug in the handling of the fi_delegations list.

nfs4_setlease does not hold the recall_lock when adding to it. The
client_mutex is held, which prevents against concurrent list changes,
but nfsd_break_deleg_cb does not hold while walking it. New delegations
could theoretically creep onto the list while we're walking it there.
