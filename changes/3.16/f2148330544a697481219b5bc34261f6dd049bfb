perf report: Add --percentage option

The --percentage option is for controlling overhead percentage
displayed.  It can only receive either of "relative" or "absolute".

"relative" means it's relative to filtered entries only so that the
sum of shown entries will be always 100%.  "absolute" means it retains
the original value before and after the filter is applied.

  $ perf report -s comm
  # Overhead       Command
  # ........  ............
  #
      74.19%           cc1
       7.61%           gcc
       6.11%            as
       4.35%            sh
       4.14%          make
       1.13%        fixdep
  ...

  $ perf report -s comm -c cc1,gcc --percentage absolute
  # Overhead       Command
  # ........  ............
  #
      74.19%           cc1
       7.61%           gcc

  $ perf report -s comm -c cc1,gcc --percentage relative
  # Overhead       Command
  # ........  ............
  #
      90.69%           cc1
       9.31%           gcc

Note that it has zero effect if no filter was applied.
