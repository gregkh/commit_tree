sparc32: drop tadpole specific code

tadpole.c assigned cpu_pwr_save based on the current configuration.
The rest of the tadpole.c file was only used if cpu_pwr_save was
dereferenced.
But this variable was never dereferenced - and I went back to a 2.6.12
kernel to check (from June 2005) - and not even then was it used.

Drop this code as it has not been in use for ~10 years.
