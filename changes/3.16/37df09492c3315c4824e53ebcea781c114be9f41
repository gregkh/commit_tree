Revert "ALSA: hda - drop def association and sequence from pinconf comparing"

This reverts commit c687200b9d4ef60042a50f7d942cfef120cc7bf1.

Dropping the def association and sequence from pinconf comparing is a
bit risky, It will introduce a greater risk of catching unwanted
machines.

And in addition, so far no BIOS experts give us an explicit answer
whether it makes senses to compare these two fields or not.

For safety reason, we revert this commit.
