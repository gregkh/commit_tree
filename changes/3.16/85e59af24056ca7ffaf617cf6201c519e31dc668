ASoC: fsl-ssi: make fsl,mode property optional

The simple soundcard binding has its own way for specifying the dai
format. To be able to use this binding we have to make the fsl,mode
property optional. As the property is used in existing devicetrees
keep the option around for compatibility reasons.
