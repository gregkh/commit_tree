ARM: idmap: add identity mapping usage note

Add a note about the usage of the identity mapping; we do not support
accesses outside of the identity map region and kernel image while a
CPU is using the identity map.  This is because the identity mapping
may overwrite vmalloc space, IO mappings, the vectors pages, etc.
