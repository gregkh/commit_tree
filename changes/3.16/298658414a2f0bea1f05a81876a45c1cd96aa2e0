Btrfs: set right total device count for seeding support

Seeding device support allows us to create a new filesystem
based on existed filesystem.

However newly created filesystem's @total_devices should include seed
devices. This patch fix the following problem:

 # mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
 # btrfstune -S 1 /dev/sdb
 # mount /dev/sdb /mnt
 # btrfs device add -f /dev/sdc /mnt --->fs_devices->total_devices = 1
 # umount /mnt
 # mount /dev/sdc /mnt               --->fs_devices->total_devices = 2

This is because we record right @total_devices in superblock, but
@fs_devices->total_devices is reset to be 0 in btrfs_prepare_sprout().

Fix this problem by not resetting @fs_devices->total_devices.
