arm64: topology: Add support for topology DT bindings

Add support for parsing the explicit topology bindings to discover the
topology of the system.

Since it is not currently clear how to map multi-level clusters for the
scheduler all leaf clusters are presented to the scheduler at the same
level. This should be enough to provide good support for current systems.
