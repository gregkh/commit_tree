Staging: unisys: detect s-Par firmware

This patch adds support for detection of s-Par firmware by checking for
the hypervisor bit in the CPU capabilities, and then querying the hypervisor
ID cpuid leaf.

This functionality will be used by the unisys drivers to determine if
they are being loaded on an s-Par platform and refuse to load if no
s-Par firmware is present.

This fixes a problem reported from upstream where a panic occurs if the
unisys drivers are loaded on a non s-Par system.
