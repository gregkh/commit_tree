ARM: EXYNOS: Fix core ID used by platsmp and hotplug code

When CPU topology is specified in device tree, cpu_logical_map() does
not return core ID anymore, but rather full MPIDR value. This breaks
existing calculation of PMU register offsets on Exynos SoCs.

This patch fixes the problem by adjusting the code to use only core ID
bits of the value returned by cpu_logical_map() to allow CPU topology to
be specified in device tree on Exynos SoCs.
