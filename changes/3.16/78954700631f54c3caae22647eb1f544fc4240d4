powerpc/eeh: Avoid I/O access during PE reset

We have suffered recrusive frozen PE a lot, which was caused
by IO accesses during the PE reset. Ben came up with the good
idea to keep frozen PE until recovery (BAR restore) gets done.
With that, IO accesses during PE reset are dropped by hardware
and wouldn't incur the recrusive frozen PE any more.

The patch implements the idea. We don't clear the frozen state
until PE reset is done completely. During the period, the EEH
core expects unfrozen state from backend to keep going. So we
have to reuse EEH_PE_RESET flag, which has been set during PE
reset, to return normal state from backend. The side effect is
we have to clear frozen state for towice (PE reset and clear it
explicitly), but that's harmless.

We have some limitations on pHyp. pHyp doesn't allow to enable
IO or DMA for unfrozen PE. So we don't enable them on unfrozen PE
in eeh_pci_enable(). We have to enable IO before grabbing logs on
pHyp. Otherwise, 0xFF's is always returned from PCI config space.
Also, we had wrong return value from eeh_pci_enable() for
EEH_OPT_THAW_DMA case. The patch fixes it too.
