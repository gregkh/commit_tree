USB: EHCI: avoid BIOS handover on the HASEE E200

Leandro Liptak reports that his HASEE E200 computer hangs when we ask
the BIOS to hand over control of the EHCI host controller.  This
definitely sounds like a bug in the BIOS, but at the moment there is
no way to fix it.

This patch works around the problem by avoiding the handoff whenever
the motherboard and BIOS version match those of Leandro's computer.
