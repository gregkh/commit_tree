mac80211: remove VLAIS usage from mac80211

Replaced the use of a Variable Length Array In Struct (VLAIS) with a
C99 compliant equivalent. This is the original VLAIS struct.

struct {
	struct aead_request     req;
	u8                      priv[crypto_aead_reqsize(tfm)];
} aead_req;

This patch instead allocates the appropriate amount of memory using a
char array.

The new code can be compiled with both gcc and clang.
