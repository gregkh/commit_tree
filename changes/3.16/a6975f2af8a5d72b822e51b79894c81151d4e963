ALSA: firewire-lib: Use IEC 61883-6 compliant labels for Raw Audio data

According to AM824 in IEC 61883-6:2002, 2 bits in LSB of label for Raw Audio
data means Valid Length Code (VBL). Ths value is:
- b00 for 24 bits sample (label is 0x40)
- b01 for 20 bits sample (label is 0x41)
- b10 for 16 bits sample (label is 0x42)

But current firewire-lib apply 24 bits label for both of 16/24 bits samples.

As long as developers investigate BeBoB/Fireworks/OXFW/Dice, all of them
have a behaviour to ignore the label. They can generate correct sound even
if firewire-lib gives wrong label (i.e. 0xff). On BeBoB, this is not only
for Raw Audio data channel, but also for IEC 60958 Conformant data channel.

So there is little possibility of regression.
