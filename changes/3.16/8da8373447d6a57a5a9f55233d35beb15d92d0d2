ACPI / processor: Fix STARTING/DYING action in acpi_cpu_soft_notify()

During CPU online/offline testing on a large system, one of the
processors got stuck after the message "bad: scheduling from the
idle thread!".  The problem is that acpi_cpu_soft_notify() calls
acpi_bus_get_device() for all action types.  CPU_STARTING and
CPU_DYING do not allow the notify handlers to sleep.  However,
acpi_bus_get_device() can sleep in acpi_ut_acquire_mutex().

Change acpi_cpu_soft_notify() to return immediately for CPU_STARTING
and CPU_DYING as they have no action in this handler.
