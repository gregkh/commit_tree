dmaengine: dw: convert to use SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS

The commit 4501fe61 "dma: dw: Add suspend and resume handling for PCI mode
DW_DMAC." introduces system power management callbacks. Regarding to commit
f78c4cff "PM / Sleep: Add macro to define common late/early system PM
callbacks" we have nice macro to setup dev_pm_ops structure. This patch
converts a driver to use the macro.
