xen-netback: Fix releasing header slot on error path

This patch makes this function aware that the first frag and the header might
share the same ring slot. That could happen if the first slot is bigger than
PKT_PROT_LEN. Due to this the error path might release that slot twice or never,
depending on the error scenario.
xenvif_idx_release is also removed from xenvif_idx_unmap, and called separately.
