rcu: Consolidate kfree_call_rcu() to use rcu_state pointer

kfree_call_rcu is defined two times. When defined under CONFIG_TREE_PREEMPT_RCU,
it uses rcu_preempt_state. Otherwise, it uses rcu_sched_state.
This patch uses the rcu_state_pointer to combine the two definitions into one.
The resulting function is placed after the closing of the preprocessor
conditional CONFIG_TREE_PREEMPT_RCU.
