drm: Move plane helpers into drm_kms_helper.ko

The drm core shouldn't depend upon any helpers, and we make sure this
doesn't accidentally happen by moving them into the helper-only
drm_kms_helper.ko module.

v2: Don't break the build for vmwgfx, spotted by Matt.

v3: Unbreak the depency loop around CONFIG_FB (not actually a loop
since it involves select). Reported by Chris.
