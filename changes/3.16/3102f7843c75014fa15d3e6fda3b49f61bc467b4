powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv: Use threads_per_subcore in KVM

To support split core on POWER8 we need to modify various parts of the
KVM code to use threads_per_subcore instead of threads_per_core. On
systems that do not support split core threads_per_subcore ==
threads_per_core and these changes are a nop.

We use threads_per_subcore as the value reported by KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT.
This communicates to userspace that guests can only be created with
a value of threads_per_core that is less than or equal to the current
threads_per_subcore. This ensures that guests can only be created with a
thread configuration that we are able to run given the current split
core mode.

Although threads_per_subcore can change during the life of the system,
the commit that enables that will ensure that threads_per_subcore does
not change during the life of a KVM VM.
