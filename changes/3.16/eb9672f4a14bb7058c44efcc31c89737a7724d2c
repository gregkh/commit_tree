net: filter: misc/various cleanups

This contains only some minor misc cleanpus. We can spare us the
extra variable declaration in __skb_get_pay_offset(), the cast in
__get_random_u32() is rather unnecessary and in __sk_migrate_realloc()
we can remove the memcpy() and do a direct assignment of the structs.
Latter was suggested by Fengguang Wu found with coccinelle. Also,
remaining pointer casts of long should be unsigned long instead.
