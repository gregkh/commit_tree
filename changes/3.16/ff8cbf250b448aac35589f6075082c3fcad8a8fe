xhci: clear root port wake on bits if controller isn't wake-up capable

When xHCI PCI host is suspended, if do_wakeup is false in xhci_pci_suspend,
xhci_bus_suspend needs to clear all root port wake on bits. Otherwise some Intel
platforms may get a spurious wakeup, even if PCI PME# is disabled.

This patch should be back-ported to kernels as old as 2.6.37, that
contains the commit 9777e3ce907d4cb5a513902a87ecd03b52499569
"USB: xHCI: bus power management implementation".
