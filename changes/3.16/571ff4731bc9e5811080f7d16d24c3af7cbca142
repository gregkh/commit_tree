autofs4: fix false positive compile error

On strict build environments we can see:

  fs/autofs4/inode.c: In function 'autofs4_fill_super':
  fs/autofs4/inode.c:312: error: 'pgrp' may be used uninitialized in this function
  make[2]: *** [fs/autofs4/inode.o] Error 1
  make[1]: *** [fs/autofs4] Error 2
  make: *** [fs] Error 2
  make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

This is due to the use of pgrp_set being used to indicate pgrp has has
been set rather than initializing pgrp itself.
