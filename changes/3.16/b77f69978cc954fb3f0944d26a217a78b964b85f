    drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.

we populated fake contexts on all platforms. These were identical to the
full hardware context tracking structs, except for the ctx->obj used to
store the hardware state. However, there remained one place where we
assumed that if a context existed, it would have an object associated
with it.
