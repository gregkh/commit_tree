sched, nohz: Change rq->nr_running to always use wrappers

Sometimes ->nr_running may cross 2 but interrupt is not being
sent to rq's cpu. In this case we don't reenable the timer.
Looks like this may be the reason for rare unexpected effects,
if nohz is enabled.

Patch replaces all places of direct changing of nr_running
and makes add_nr_running() caring about crossing border.
