printk: remove outdated comment

Comment about interesting interlocking between lockbuf_lock and
console_sem is outdated.

It was added in 2002 by commit a880f45a48be during conversion of
console_lock to console_sem + lockbuf_lock.

At that time release_console_sem() (today's equivalent is
console_unlock()) was indeed using lockbuf_lock to avoid races between
trylock on console_sem in printk() and unlock of console_sem.  However
these days the interlocking is gone and the races are avoided by
rechecking logbuf state after releasing console_sem.
