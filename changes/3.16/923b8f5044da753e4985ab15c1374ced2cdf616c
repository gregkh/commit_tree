arm64: mm: Make icache synchronisation logic huge page aware

The __sync_icache_dcache routine will only flush the dcache for the
first page of a compound page, potentially leading to stale icache
data residing further on in a hugetlb page.

This patch addresses this issue by taking into consideration the
order of the page when flushing the dcache.
