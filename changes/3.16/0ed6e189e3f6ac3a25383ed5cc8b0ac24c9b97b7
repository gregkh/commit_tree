target: Fix NULL pointer dereference for XCOPY in target_put_sess_cmd

This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference regression bug that was
introduced with:

commit 1e1110c43b1cda9fe77fc4a04835e460550e6b3c

    target: fix memory leak on XCOPY

Now that target_put_sess_cmd() -> kref_put_spinlock_irqsave() is
called with a valid se_cmd->cmd_kref, a NULL pointer dereference
is triggered because the XCOPY passthrough commands don't have
an associated se_session pointer.

To address this bug, go ahead and checking for a NULL se_sess pointer
within target_put_sess_cmd(), and call se_cmd->se_tfo->release_cmd()
to release the XCOPY's xcopy_pt_cmd memory.
