drm/i915: Simplify i915_gem_release_all_mmaps()

An object can only have an active gtt mapping if it is currently bound
into the global gtt. Therefore we can simply walk the list of all bound
objects and check the flag upon those for an active gtt mapping.

    drm/i915: release the GTT mmaps when going into D3

Also note that the WARN is inappropriate for this function as GPU
activity is orthogonal to GTT mmap status. Rather it is the caller that
relies upon this condition and so it should assert that the GPU is idle
itself.
