USB: sierra: fix use after free at suspend/resume

Fix use after free or NULL-pointer dereference during suspend and
resume.

The port data may never have been allocated (port probe failed)
or may already have been released by port_remove (e.g. driver is
unloaded) when suspend and resume are called.

online")
