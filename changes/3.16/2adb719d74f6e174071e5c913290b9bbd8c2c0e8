net: mvneta: Implement software TSO

Now that the TSO helper API has been introduced, this commit makes use
of it to implement the TSO in this driver.

Using iperf to test and vmstat to check the CPU usage, shows a substantial
CPU usage drop when TSO is on (~15% vs. ~25%). HTTP-based tests performed
by Willy Tarreau have shown performance improvements.
