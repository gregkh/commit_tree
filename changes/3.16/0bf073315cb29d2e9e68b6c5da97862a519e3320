mm: softdirty: make freshly remapped file pages being softdirty unconditionally

Hugh reported:

 | I noticed your soft_dirty work in install_file_pte(): which looked
 | good at first, until I realized that it's propagating the soft_dirty
 | of a pte it's about to zap completely, to the unrelated entry it's
 | about to insert in its place.  Which seems very odd to me.

Indeed this code ends up being nop in result -- pte_file_mksoft_dirty()
operates with pte_t argument and returns new pte_t which were never used
after.  After looking more I think what we need is to soft-dirtify all
newely remapped file pages because it should look like a new mapping for
memory tracker.
