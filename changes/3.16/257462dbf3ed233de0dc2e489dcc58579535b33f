pwm-backlight: switch to gpiod interface

Switch to the new gpiod interface, which allows to handle GPIO
properties such as active low transparently and removes a whole bunch of
code.

There are still a couple of users of this driver that rely on passing
the enable GPIO number through platform data, so a fallback mechanism
using a GPIO number is still available to avoid breaking them. It will
be removed once current users have switched to the GPIO lookup tables
provided by the gpiod interface.
