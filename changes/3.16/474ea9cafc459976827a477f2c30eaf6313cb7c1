net: bcmgenet: correctly pad short packets

Packets shorter than ETH_ZLEN were not padded with zeroes, hence leaking
potentially sensitive information. This bug has been present since the
driver got accepted in commit 1c1008c793fa46703a2fee469f4235e1c7984333
("net: bcmgenet: add main driver file").
