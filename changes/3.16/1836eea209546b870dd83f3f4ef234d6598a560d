lib/crc7: Shift crc7() output left 1 bit

This eliminates a 1-bit left shift in every single caller,
and makes the inner loop of the CRC computation more efficient.

Renamed crc7 to crc7_be (big-endian) since the interface changed.

Also purged #include <linux/crc7.h> from files that don't use it at all.
