ethtool: Disallow ETHTOOL_SRSSH with both indir table and hash key unchanged

This would be a no-op, so there is no reason to request it.

This also allows conversion of the current implementations of
ethtool_ops::{get,set}_rxfh_indir to ethtool_ops::{get,set}_rxfh
with no change other than their parameters.
