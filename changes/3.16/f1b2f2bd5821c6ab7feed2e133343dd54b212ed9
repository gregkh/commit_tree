ftrace: Remove FTRACE_UPDATE_MODIFY_CALL_REGS flag

As the decision to what needs to be done (converting a call to the
ftrace_caller to ftrace_caller_regs or to convert from ftrace_caller_regs
to ftrace_caller) can easily be determined from the rec->flags of
FTRACE_FL_REGS and FTRACE_FL_REGS_EN, there's no need to have the
ftrace_check_record() return either a UPDATE_MODIFY_CALL_REGS or a
UPDATE_MODIFY_CALL. Just he latter is enough. This added flag causes
more complexity than is required. Remove it.
