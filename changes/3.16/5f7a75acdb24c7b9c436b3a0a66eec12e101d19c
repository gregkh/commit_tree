mm: page_alloc: do not cache reclaim distances

pgdat->reclaim_nodes tracks if a remote node is allowed to be reclaimed
by zone_reclaim due to its distance.  As it is expected that
zone_reclaim_mode will be rarely enabled it is unreasonable for all
machines to take a penalty.  Fortunately, the zone_reclaim_mode() path
is already slow and it is the path that takes the hit.
