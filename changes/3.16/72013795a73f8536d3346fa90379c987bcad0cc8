ACPI: Add acpi_bus_attach_private_data() to attach data to ACPI handle

There is already acpi_bus_get_private_data() to get ACPI handle data
which is associated with acpi_bus_private_data_handler(). This patch
is to add acpi_bus_attach_private_data() to make a pair and facilitate
to attach and get data to/from ACPI handle.
