staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: move apci1564_do_insn_bits() to addi_apci_1564.c

This function is already compliant with the comedi API and is behaving as
comedi core expects.  This patch moves it out of
addi-data/hwdrv_apci1564.c and into the driver proper since no further
work needs to be done on it.
