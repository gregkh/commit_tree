staging/lustre: replace semaphores with mutexes

It's just optimization. The mutex subsystem is slightly faster
and has better scalability for contended workloads.

Remove the lustre_lock and it's accessor functions l_lock(),
l_unlock(), l_lock_init(), and l_has_lock() since they have
not been used by the code since Lustre 1.6.
