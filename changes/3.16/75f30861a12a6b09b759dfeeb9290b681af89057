mm, thp: avoid excessive compaction latency during fault

Synchronous memory compaction can be very expensive: it can iterate an
enormous amount of memory without aborting, constantly rescheduling,
waiting on page locks and lru_lock, etc, if a pageblock cannot be
defragmented.

Unfortunately, it's too expensive for transparent hugepage page faults and
it's much better to simply fallback to pages.  On 128GB machines, we find
that synchronous memory compaction can take O(seconds) for a single thp
fault.

Now that async compaction remembers where it left off without strictly
relying on sync compaction, this makes thp allocations best-effort without
causing egregious latency during fault.  We still need to retry async
compaction after reclaim, but this won't stall for seconds.
