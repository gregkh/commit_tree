scsi/NCR5380: adopt dprintk()

All NCR5380 drivers already include the NCR5380.h header. Better to
adopt those macros rather than have three variations on them.

Moreover, the macros in NCR5380.h are preferable because the atari_NCR5380
and sun3_NCR5380 versions are inflexible. For example, they can't accomodate
dprintk(NDEBUG_MAIN | NDEBUG_QUEUES, ...)

Replace the *_PRINTK macros from atari_NCR5380.h and sun3_NCR5380.h with
the equivalent macros from NCR5380.h.
