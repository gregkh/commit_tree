staging: r8192ee: Fix kernel WARN splat associated with rate control

The 0day kernel testing robot got the kernel warning caused by trying
to register a particular rate-control algorithm more than once. I believe
that the core already protects against a particular driver doing the
registration more than once, but an analysis of the code reveals that
the identical name is used for the rtlwifi drivers in the regular
wireless tree, and the staging drivers r8192ee and r8821ae. The fix
is to rename the algorithm used in r8192ee.
