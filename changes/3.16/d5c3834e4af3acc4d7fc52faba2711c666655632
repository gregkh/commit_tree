usb: make usb_port flags atomic, rename did_runtime_put to child_usage

We want to manipulate ->did_runtime_put in usb_port_runtime_resume(),
but we don't want that to collide with other updates.  Move usb_port
flags to new port-bitmap fields in usb_hub. "did_runtime_put" is renamed
"child_usage_bits" to reflect that it is strictly standing in for the
fact that usb_devices are not the device_model children of their parent
port.
