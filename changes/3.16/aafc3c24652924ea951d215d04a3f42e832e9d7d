xfs: support the XFS_BTNUM_FINOBT free inode btree type

Define the AGI fields for the finobt root/level and add magic
numbers. Update the btree code to add support for the new
XFS_BTNUM_FINOBT inode btree.

The finobt root block is reserved immediately following the inobt
root block in the AG. Update XFS_PREALLOC_BLOCKS() to determine the
starting AG data block based on whether finobt support is enabled.
