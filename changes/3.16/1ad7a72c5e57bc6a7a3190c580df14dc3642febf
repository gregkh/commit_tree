powerpc/eeh: Report frozen parent PE prior to child PE

When we have the corner case of frozen parent and child PE at the
same time, we have to handle the frozen parent PE prior to the
child. Without clearning the frozen state on parent PE, the child
PE can't be recovered successfully.

The patch searches the EEH PE hierarchy tree and returns the toppest
frozen PE to be handled. It ensures the frozen parent PE will be
handled prior to child PE.
