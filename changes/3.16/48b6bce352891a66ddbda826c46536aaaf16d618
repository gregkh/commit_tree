pinctrl: berlin: add the BG2CD pinctrl driver

Add the pin-controller driver for the Berlin BG2Q SoC, with definition
of its groups and functions. Pin control registers are part of chip/
system control registers, which will be represented by a single node.
Until a proper driver for the chip/system control is available,
register the corresponding regmap in pinctrl driver probe.
