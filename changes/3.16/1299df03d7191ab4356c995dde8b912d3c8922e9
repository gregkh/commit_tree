ARM: shmobile: henninger: add SDHI0/2 DT support

Define the Henninger board dependent part of the SDHI0/2 device nodes along with
the necessary voltage regulators (note that the Vcc regulators are dummy -- they
are required but don't actually exist on the board). Also, GPIOs have to be used
for the CD and WP signals due to the SDHI driver constraints...
