Btrfs: make fsync work after cloning into a file

When cloning into a file, we were correctly replacing the extent
items in the target range and removing the extent maps. However
we weren't replacing the extent maps with new ones that point to
the new extents - as a consequence, an incremental fsync (when the
inode doesn't have the full sync flag) was a NOOP, since it relies
on the existence of extent maps in the modified list of the inode's
extent map tree, which was empty. Therefore add new extent maps to
reflect the target clone range.

A test case for xfstests follows.
