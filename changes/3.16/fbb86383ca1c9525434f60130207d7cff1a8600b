sparc32: fix sparse warnings in irq_32.c

Fix following warnings:
irq_32.c:239:5: warning: symbol 'sparc_floppy_request_irq' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:294:24: warning: symbol 'fdc_status' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:297:6: warning: symbol 'pdma_vaddr' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:300:15: warning: symbol 'pdma_size' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:303:14: warning: symbol 'doing_pdma' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:306:6: warning: symbol 'pdma_base' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:309:15: warning: symbol 'pdma_areasize' was not declared. Should it be static?
irq_32.c:317:6: warning: symbol 'sparc_floppy_irq' was not declared. Should it be static?

The floppy parts were all added to iasm/setup.h - no other header files looked obvious.
floppy_32.h was not an option as this file can only be included once from the
floppy driver.
