ARM: dts: kirkwood: set default pinctrl for I2C0

There is only one valid pinctrl setting for I2C0 on Kirkwood. Now that we
have the setting in the common SoC pinctrl, move it to the I2C0 controller
node directly and remove it from the individual boards.

While at it, also fix up status = "okay" to "ok" on one board's I2C0 node.
