perf tools: Allocate thread map_groups's dynamically

Moving towards sharing map groups within a process threads.

Because of this we need the map groups to be dynamically allocated. No
other functional change is intended in here.

Based on a patch by Jiri Olsa, but this time _just_ making the
conversion from statically allocating thread->mg to turning it into a
pointer and instead of initializing it at thread's constructor,
introduce a constructor/destructor for the map_groups class and
call at thread creation time.

Later we will introduce the get/put methods when we move to sharing
those map_groups, when the get/put refcounting semantics will be needed.
