tipc: remove TIPC_NAMES_GONE node flag

Since previously what all publications pertaining to the lost node
were removed from name table was finished in tasklet context
asynchronously, we need to TIPC_NAMES_GONE flag indicating whether
the node cleanup work is finished or not. But now as the cleanup work
has been finished when node lock is released, the flag becomes
meaningless for us.
