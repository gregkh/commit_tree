ALSA: bebob: Prepare for device specific operations

This commit is for some devices which have its own operations or quirks.

Many functionality should be implemented in user land. Then this commit adds
functionality related to stream such as sampling frequency or clock source. For
help to debug, this commit adds the functionality to get metering information
if it's available.

To help these functionalities, this commit adds some AV/C commands defined in
'AV/C Audio Subunit Specification (1394TA).
