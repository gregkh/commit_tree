SMACK: Fix handling value==NULL in post setxattr

The function `smack_inode_post_setxattr` is called each
time that a setxattr is done, for any value of name.
The kernel allow to put value==NULL when size==0
to set an empty attribute value. The systematic
call to smk_import_entry was causing the dereference
of a NULL pointer hence a KERNEL PANIC!

The problem can be produced easily by issuing the
command `setfattr -n user.data file` under bash prompt
when SMACK is active.

Moving the call to smk_import_entry as proposed by this
patch is correcting the behaviour because the function
smack_inode_post_setxattr is called for the SMACK's
attributes only if the function smack_inode_setxattr validated
the value and its size (what will not be the case when size==0).

It also has a benefical effect to not fill the smack hash
with garbage values coming from any extended attribute
write.
