ACPICA: Back port of _PRP update.

This patch is the linuxize result of the following commit:
  Subject: ACPICA: Add check for _PRP/_HID dependency, with error message.
  _PRP requires that a _HID appears in the same scope.

The iASL changes are not in this patch as iASL currently is not
shipped in the kernel.
