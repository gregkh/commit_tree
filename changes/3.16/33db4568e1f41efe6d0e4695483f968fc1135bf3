perf top: Add --percentage option

The --percentage option is for controlling overhead percentage
displayed.  It can only receive either of "relative" or "absolute".
Move the parser callback function into a common location since it's
used by multiple commands now.

For more information, please see previous commit same thing done to
"perf report".
