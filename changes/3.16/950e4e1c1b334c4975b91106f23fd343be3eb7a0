crypto: testmgr - add empty and large test vectors for SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512

Patch adds large test-vectors for SHA algorithms for better code coverage in
optimized assembly implementations. Empty test-vectors are also added, as some
crypto drivers appear to have special case handling for empty input.
