ALSA: firewire-lib: Add support for AMDTP in-stream and PCM capture

For capturing PCM, this commit adds the functionality to handle in-stream.
This is also applied for dual-wire mode.

Currently, capturing 32bit samples are supported.

When the sequence of in-packet has discontinuity of dbc, in-stream isn't handled
and amdtp_streaming_error() returns true.
