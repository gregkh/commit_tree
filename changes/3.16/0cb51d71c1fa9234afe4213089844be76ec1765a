cgroup: move cgroup->serial_nr into cgroup_subsys_state

We're moving towards using cgroup_subsys_states as the fundamental
structural blocks.  All csses including the cgroup->self and actual
ones now form trees through css->children and ->sibling which follow
the same rules as what cgroup->children and ->sibling followed.  This
patch moves cgroup->serial_nr which is used to implement css iteration
into css.

Note that all csses, regardless of their types, allocate their serial
numbers from the same monotonically increasing counter.  This doesn't
affect the ordering needed by css iteration or cause any other
material behavior changes.  This will be used to update css iteration.
