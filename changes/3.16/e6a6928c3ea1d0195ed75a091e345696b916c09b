of/fdt: Convert FDT functions to use libfdt

The kernel FDT functions predate libfdt and are much more limited in
functionality. Also, the kernel functions and libfdt functions are
not compatible with each other because they have different definitions
of node offsets. To avoid this incompatibility and in preparation to
add more FDT parsing functions which will need libfdt, let's first
convert the existing code to use libfdt.

The FDT unflattening, top-level FDT scanning, and property retrieval
functions are converted to use libfdt. The scanning code should be
re-worked to be more efficient and understandable by using libfdt to
find nodes directly by path or compatible strings.
