tcp: improve fastopen icmp handling

If a fast open socket is already accepted by the user, it should
be treated like a connected socket to record the ICMP error in
sk_softerr, so the user can fetch it. Do that in both tcp_v4_err
and tcp_v6_err.

Also refactor the sequence window check to improve readability
(e.g., there were two local variables named 'req').
