arm64: defconfig: enable a few more common/useful options in defconfig

Whilst our defconfig is certainly usable, there are a few extra features
we can enable to make it considerably more useful, particularly if
people are using it for testing:

 - KVM
 - SWAP
 - Hugepages
 - ARMv8 crypto

This patch enables these options in our defconfig. Note that the ordering
has changed slightly, since this is the result of a new savedefconfig
make target.
