crypto: arm64-aes - fix encryption of unaligned data

cryptsetup fails on arm64 when using kernel encryption via AF_ALG socket.
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1122937

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of unaligned data in
arch/arm64/crypto/aes-glue.c. Cryptsetup creates a buffer that is aligned
on 8 bytes, but not on 16 bytes. It opens AF_ALG socket and uses the
socket to encrypt data in the buffer. The arm64 crypto accelerator causes
data corruption or crashes in the scatterwalk_pagedone.

This patch fixes the bug by passing the residue bytes that were not
processed as the last parameter to blkcipher_walk_done.
