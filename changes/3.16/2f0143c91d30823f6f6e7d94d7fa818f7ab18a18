powerpc/kprobes: Fix jprobes on ABI v2 (LE)

In commit 721aeaa9 "Build little endian ppc64 kernel with ABIv2", we
missed some updates required in the kprobes code to make jprobes work
when the kernel is built with ABI v2.

Firstly update arch_deref_entry_point() to do the right thing. Now that
we have added ppc_global_function_entry() we can just always use that, it
will do the right thing for 32 & 64 bit and ABI v1 & v2.

Secondly we need to update the code that sets up the register state before
calling the jprobe handler. On ABI v1 we setup r2 to hold the TOC, on ABI
v2 we need to populate r12 with the function entry point address.
