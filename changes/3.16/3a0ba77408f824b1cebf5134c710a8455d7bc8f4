MIPS: KVM: Migrate hrtimer to follow VCPU

When a VCPU is scheduled in on a different CPU, refresh the hrtimer used
for emulating count/compare so that it gets migrated to the same CPU.

This should prevent a timer interrupt occurring on a different CPU to
where the guest it relates to is running, which would cause the guest
timer interrupt not to be delivered until after the next guest exit.
