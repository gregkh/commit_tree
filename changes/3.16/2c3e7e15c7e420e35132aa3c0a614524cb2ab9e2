s390/cio: set device name as early as possible

Currently we set the device name at the time we call device_add after
we receive the interrupt for the first I/O. When something is not working
as expected during that first I/O (e.g. we don't receive an interrupt) we
print a message including the device name which has not yet been
initialized.

Set the device name after calling device_initialize (prior to starting
the first I/O) so that we have the name present if some unexpected error
occurs during that first I/O.
