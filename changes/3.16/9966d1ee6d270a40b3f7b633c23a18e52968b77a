ixgbe: separate the PTP suspend and stop actions

Since we are adding proper support for suspend of PTP, extract out of
ixgbe_ptp_stop those things relevant to suspend. Then, have
ixgbe_ptp_stop call ixgbe_ptp_suspend. The next patch in the series will
have ixgbe_ptp_suspend called from the ixgbe_suspend path.
