kernel/printk/printk.c: revert "printk: enable interrupts before calling console_trylock_for_printk()"

Revert commit 939f04bec1a4 ("printk: enable interrupts before calling
console_trylock_for_printk()").

Andreas reported:

: None of the post 3.15 kernel boot for me. They all hang at the GRUB
: screen telling me it loaded and started the kernel, but the kernel
: itself stops before it prints anything (or even replaces the GRUB
: background graphics).

939f04bec1a4 is modest latency reduction.  Revert it until we understand
the reason for these failures.
