stagaing/lustre: Improve statahead debug messages

The statahead debug messages include the pid of the current
process in their body.  This is both redudant (because all
lustre log messages contain the pid), and sometimes downright
misleading.  For instance the messages would say something like
"stopping statahead thread 3446".  One would probably think
that 3446 is the pid of the process that is being stopped,
but in fact it was the pid of the caller issuing the stop signal.

We remove all superfluous pids from the messages.

Next we have the ll_statahead_thread() and the ll_agl_thread() record
their respective pids in their respective ptlrpc_thread structures.
This allows to print the pid of the thread that we are trying to
stop (which is actually useful info) from other threads, such as those
calling ll_stop_statahead().
