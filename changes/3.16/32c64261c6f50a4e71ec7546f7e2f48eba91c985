spi: rspi: Do not call rspi_receive_init() for TX-only

Since commit 8449fd76deb9ac67a15a6fb8ead7bb4595d019d2 ("spi: rspi: Merge
rspi_send_pio() and rspi_receive_pio()"), rspi_receive_init() is called
for transmit-only transfers too, while this is not needed.
Only call rspi_receive_init() when receiving, to preserve behavior on
RSPI on SH.
