xfs: remove mp->m_dir_geo from directory logging

We don't pass the xfs_da_args or the geometry all the way down to
the directory buffer logging code, hence we have to use
mp->m_dir_geo here. Fix this to use the geometry passed via the
xfs_da_args, and convert all the directory logging functions for
consistency.
