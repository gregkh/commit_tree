hso: fix deadlock when receiving bursts of data

When the module sends bursts of data, sometimes a deadlock happens in
the hso driver when the tty buffer doesn't get the chance to be flushed
quickly enough.

Remove the endless while loop in function put_rxbuf_data() which is
called by the urb completion handler.
If there isn't enough room in the tty buffer, discards all the data
received in the URB.
