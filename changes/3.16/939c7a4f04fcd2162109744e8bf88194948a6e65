tracing: Introduce saved_cmdlines_size file

Introduce saved_cmdlines_size file for changing the number of saved pid-comms.
saved_cmdlines currently stores 128 command names using SAVED_CMDLINES, but
'no-existing processes' names are often lost in saved_cmdlines when we
read the trace data. So, by introducing saved_cmdlines_size file, we can
now change the 128 command names saved to something much larger if needed.

When we write a value to saved_cmdlines_size, the number of the value will
be stored in pid-comm list:

	# echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/saved_cmdlines_size

Here, 1024 command names can be stored. The default number is 128 and the maximum
number is PID_MAX_DEFAULT (=32768 if CONFIG_BASE_SMALL is not set). So, if we
want to avoid losing any command names, we need to set 32768 to
saved_cmdlines_size.

We can read the maximum number of the list:

	# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/saved_cmdlines_size
	128
