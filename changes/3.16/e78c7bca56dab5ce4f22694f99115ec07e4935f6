sched: Simplify return logic in sched_copy_attr()

The logic in this function is a little contorted, clean it up:

  * Rather than having chained gotos for the -EFBIG case, just
    return -EFBIG directly.

  * Now, the label 'out' is no longer needed, and 'ret' must be zero
    zero by the time we fall through to this point, so just return 0.
