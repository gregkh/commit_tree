usb: ohci: sort out dependencies for lpc32xx and omap

The dependency on the isp1301 driver is not something that
should be in the main OHCI driver but rather the SoC specific
part of it.

This moves the dependency for LPC32xx into USB_OHCI_HCD_LPC32XX,
and changes the 'select ISP1301_OMAP' to a similar 'depends on'.
Since the same dependency exists for the client driver, do the
same change there.
