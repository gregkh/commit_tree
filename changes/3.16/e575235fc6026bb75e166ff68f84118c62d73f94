net: sctp: migrate most recently used transport to ktime

Be more precise in transport path selection and use ktime
helpers instead of jiffies to compare and pick the better
primary and secondary recently used transports. This also
avoids any side-effects during a possible roll-over, and
could lead to better path decision-making.
