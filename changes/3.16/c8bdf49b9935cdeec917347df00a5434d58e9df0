ALSA: fireworks/firewire-lib: Add a quirk for the meaning of dbc

Fireworks has a quirk for the value of dbc field in transmitted packets.
For Fireworks, dbc means the end of events in current packet. This is out
of specification.

For example, AudioFire4:
CIP0        CIP1    Payload
01070092 90FFFFFF 02
0107009A 9001E17B 3A <-
010700A2 9001F6E5 3A
010700A2 90FFFFFF 02
010700AA 9001104F 3A <-
010700B2 900125B9 3A
010700BA 90013B23 3A
010700BA 90FFFFFF 02
010700C2 9001548E 3A <-
010700CA 900169F8 3A
010700CA 90FFFFFF 02
010700D2 90018362 3A <-
010700DA 900198CC 3A

According to IEC 61883-1/6, a packet following to empty packet has the same
value for its dbc. But for Fireworks, it's incremented and empty packet has
the same value as previous packet in dbc field.

This commit adds a flag for Fireworks and some codes to checking dbc continuity.
