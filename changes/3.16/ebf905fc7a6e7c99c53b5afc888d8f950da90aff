perf: Fix use after free in perf_remove_from_context()

While that mutex should guard the elements, it doesn't guard against the
use-after-free that's from list_for_each_entry_rcu().
__perf_event_exit_task() can actually free the event.

And because list addition/deletion is guarded by both ctx->mutex and
ctx->lock, holding ctx->mutex is sufficient for reading the list, so we
don't actually need the rcu list iteration.
