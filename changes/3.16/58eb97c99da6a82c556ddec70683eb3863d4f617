serial: sirf: Fix compilation failure

After 07d410e0) serial: sirf: fix spinlock deadlock issue it is no longer
possiblet to compile this driver. The rename of one of the spinlocks is
faulty. After looking at the original patch I believe this is the correct
fix.

Compile tested using ARM's multi_v7_defconfig
