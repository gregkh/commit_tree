ALSA: hda - restore BCLK M/N values when resuming HSW/BDW display controller

For Intel Haswell/Broadwell display HD-A controller, the 24MHz HD-A link BCLK
is converted from Core Display Clock (CDCLK): BCLK = CDCLK * M / N
And there are two registers EM4 and EM5 to program M, N value respectively.
The EM4/EM5 values will be lost and when the display power well is disabled.

BIOS programs CDCLK selected by OEM and EM4/EM5, but BIOS has no idea about
display power well on/off at runtime. So the M/N can be wrong if non-default
CDCLK is used when the audio controller resumes, which results in an invalid
BCLK and abnormal audio playback rate. So this patch saves and restores valid
M/N values on controller suspend/resume.

And 'struct hda_intel' is defined to contain standard HD-A 'struct azx' and
Intel specific fields, as Takashi suggested.
