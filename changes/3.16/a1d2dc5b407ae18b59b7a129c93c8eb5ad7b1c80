NFC: trf7970a: Turn RF on after hardware is configured

The NFC digital layer calls the 'switch_rf' hook to turn the RF on before
it configures the RF technology and framing. There is potential to confuse
a tag doing it this way so don't enable the RF until the RF technology and
initial framing have been configured.
