memory: mvebu-devbus: split functions

The mvebu-devbus driver currently only supports the Armada 370/XP
family, but it can also cover the Orion5x family. However, the Orion5x
family has a different organization of the registers.

Therefore, in preparation to the introduction of Orion5x support, we
separate into two functions the code that 1/ retrieves the timing
parameters from the Device Tree and 2/ applies those timings
parameters into the hardware registers.
