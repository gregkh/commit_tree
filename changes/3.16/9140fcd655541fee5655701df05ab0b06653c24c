staging: dgap: implement error handling in dgap_tty_register()

- alloc_tty_driver() is deprecated so it is changed to
tty_alloc_driver()
- Pointers which are allocated by alloc_tty_driver() and kzalloc()
can be NULL so it need to check NULL for them.
- If one of those is failed, it need to add proper handler for
avoiding memory leak.
- If both of drivers are registered normally, and
then set TRUE to dgap_major_serial{print}_registered. If one
of drivers is failed to register, leave a default value as
FALSE.
