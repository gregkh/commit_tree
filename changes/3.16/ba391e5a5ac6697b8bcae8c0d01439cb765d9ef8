HID: rmi: do not handle touchscreens through hid-rmi

Currently, hid-rmi drives every Synaptics product, but the touchscreens
on the Windows tablets should be handled through hid-multitouch.

Instead of providing a long list of PIDs, rely on the scan_report
capability to detect which should go to hid-multitouch, and which
should not go to hid-rmi.
