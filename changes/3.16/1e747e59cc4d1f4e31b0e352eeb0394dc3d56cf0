pinctrl: rockchip: base regmap supplied by a syscon

This allows the basic registers of the general register files to be supplied
by a syscon instead of being mapped locally.

The GRF registers contain a lot more than pinctrl functions like dma, usb-phy
and general soc control and status registers, intermixed with the iomux, pull
and drive-strength registers.
