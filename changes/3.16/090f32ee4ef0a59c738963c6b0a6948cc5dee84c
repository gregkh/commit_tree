ext4: get rid of EXT4_MAP_UNINIT flag

Currently EXT4_MAP_UNINIT is used in dioread_nolock case to mark the
cases where we're using dioread_nolock and we're writing into either
unallocated, or unwritten extent, because we need to make sure that
any DIO write into that inode will wait for the extent conversion.

However EXT4_MAP_UNINIT is not only entirely misleading name but also
unnecessary because we can check for EXT4_MAP_UNWRITTEN in the
dioread_nolock case instead.

This commit removes EXT4_MAP_UNINIT flag.
