PCI: Fix use of uninitialized MPS value

If "pcie_bus_config == PCIE_BUS_PERFORMANCE", we don't initialize "smpss",
so we pass a pointer to garbage into pcie_bus_configure_set(), where we
compute "mps" based on the garbage.  We then pass the garbage "mps" to
pcie_write_mps(), which ignores it in the PCIE_BUS_PERFORMANCE case.

Coverity isn't smart enough to deduce that we ignore the garbage (it's a
lot to expect from a human, too), so initialize "smpss" to a safe value in
all cases.
