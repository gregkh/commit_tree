ASoC: Intel: Simplify Baytrail stream control IPC construction

Baytrail ADSP stream IPC simplifies a little by moving IPC_IA_START_STREAM
construction and sending directly into sst_byt_stream_start() from
sst_byt_stream_operations(). This is because IPC_IA_START_STREAM is only
stream IPC with extra message data so this move saves a few code lines.

Main motivation for this is to prepare for passing stream start position
to sst_byt_stream_start() which will be needed in resume code.
