powerpc: Remove platforms/wsp and associated pieces

__attribute__ ((unused))

WSP is the last user of CONFIG_PPC_A2, so we remove that as well.

Although CONFIG_PPC_ICSWX still exists, it's no longer selectable for
any Book3E platform, so we can remove the code in mmu-book3e.h that
depended on it.
