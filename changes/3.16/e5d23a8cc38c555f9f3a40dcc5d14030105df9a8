virtio-rng: fix boot with virtio-rng device

Commit "virtio-rng: support multiple virtio-rng devices" has broken
boot with a virtio-rng device because the 'init' callback of the
virtio-rng device was left unitialized to garbage, and got called
by the hwrng infrastructure, killing the guest on boot.
