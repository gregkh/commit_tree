ASoC: dapm: Handle SND_SOC_DAPM_REG() generically

Commit commit de9ba98b6d ("ASoC: dapm: Make widget power register settings more
flexible") added generic support for on_val/off_val in the DAPM core. With this
in place there is no need anymore for having a special event callback for
SND_SOC_DAPM_REG() widgets.
