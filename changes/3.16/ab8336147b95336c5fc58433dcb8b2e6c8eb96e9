ARM: dts: kirkwood: add stdout-path property to all boards

ePAPR allows to reference the device used for console output by
stdout-path property. With node labels for Kirkwood UART0, now
reference it on all Kirkwood boards that already have ttyS0 in
their bootargs property.

While at it, fix some whitespace issues on mplcec4's chosen node
(there are more, but we only fix the chosen node now)
