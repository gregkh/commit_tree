ALSA: fireworks/bebob: Use the same type of variables as function parameters

The second argument of snd_efw_command_get_sampling_rate() means sampling
rate and its type is 'unsigned int'. But 'int' variable is passed as parameter.
It's better to apply the same type for the variable as its argument.

Similally, the type of variable for snd_efw_command_get_clock_source() and
avc_bridgeco_get_plug_type() should be the same type as each argument.
