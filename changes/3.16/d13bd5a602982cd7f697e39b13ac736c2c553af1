ACPICA: Linux headers: Add <acpi/platform/aclinuxex.h>

From ACPICA's perspective, <acpi/actypes.h> should be included after
inclusion of <acpi/platform/acenv.h>.  But currently in Linux,
<acpi/platform/aclinux.h> included by <acpi/platform/acenv.h> has
included <acpi/actypes.h> to find ACPICA types for inline functions.

This causes the following problem:
1. Redundant code in <asm/acpi.h> and <acpi/platform/aclinux.h>:
   Linux must be careful to keep conditions for <acpi/actypes.h> inclusion
   consistent with the conditions for <acpi/platform/aclinux.h> inclusion.
   Which finally leads to the issue that we have to keep many useless macro
   definitions in <acpi/platform/aclinux.h> or <asm/acpi.h>.
   Such conditions include:
     COMPILER_DEPENDENT_UINT64
     COMPILER_DEPENDENT_INT64
     ACPI_INLINE
     ACPI_SYSTEM_XFACE
     ACPI_EXTERNAL_XFACE
     ACPI_INTERNAL_XFACE
     ACPI_INTERNAL_VAR_XFACE
     ACPI_MUTEX_TYPE
     DEBUGGER_THREADING
     ACPI_ACQUIRE_GLOBAL_LOCK
     ACPI_RELEASE_GLOBAL_LOCK
     ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE
   They have default implementations in <include/acpi/platform/acenv.h>
   while Linux need to keep a copy in <asm/acpi.h> to avoid build errors.

This patch introduces <acpi/platform/aclinuxex.h> to fix this issue by
splitting conditions and declarations (most of them are inline functions)
into 2 header files so that the wrong inclusion of <acpi/actypes.h> can be
removed from <acpi/platform/aclinux.h>.

This patch also removes old ACPI_NATIVE_INTERFACE_HEADER mechanism which is
not preferred by Linux and adds the platform/acenvex.h to be the solution
to solve this issue.
