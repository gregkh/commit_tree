mtip32xx: minor performance enhancements

This patch adds the following:

1) Compiler hinting in the fast path.
2) A prefetch of port->flags to eliminate moderate cpu stalling later
in mtip_hw_submit_io().
3) Eliminate a redundant rq_data_dir().
4) Reorder members of driver_data to eliminate false cacheline sharing
between irq_workers_active and unal_qdepth.

With some workload and topology configurations, I'm seeing ~1.5%
throughput improvement in small block random read benchmarks as well
as improved latency std. dev.
