powerpc/eeh: Allow to disable EEH

The patch introduces bootarg "eeh=off" to disable EEH functinality.
Also, it creates /sys/kerenl/debug/powerpc/eeh_enable to disable
or enable EEH functionality. By default, we have the functionality
enabled.

For PowerNV platform, we will restore to have the conventional
mechanism of clearing frozen PE during PCI config access if we're
going to disable EEH functionality. Conversely, we will rely on
EEH for error recovery.

The patch also fixes the issue that we missed to cover the case
of disabled EEH functionality in function ioda_eeh_event(). Those
events driven by interrupt should be cleared to avoid endless
reporting.
