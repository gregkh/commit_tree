iio: hid-sensors: Get feature report from sensor hub after changing power state

Some sensor hubs require a get feature report call to be issued soon after
changing the power state of the sensor. Without this, the sensor remains in
the current state. This patch adds a call soon after the power state.

This is retained as a generic call across all sensor hubs since the behavior
has been noticed on more than one implementation.
