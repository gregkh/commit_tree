Revert "perf: Disable PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 support"

This reverts commit 3090ffb5a2515990182f3f55b0688a7817325488.

Re-enable the mmap2 interface as we will have a user soon.

Since things have changed since perf disabled mmap2, small tweaks
to the revert had to be done:

o commit 9d4ecc88 forced (n!=8) to become (n<7)
o a new libunwind test needed updating to use mmap2 interface
