ACPI / video: Add Dell Inspiron 5737 to the blacklist

With win8 capabiltiy, the ACPI backlight control is broken.
The system also loses backlight setting when resuming from S3.

Add this model to the the ACPI video detect blacklist to make backlight
functionality work.

Although backlight functionality works via video.use_native_backlight=1,
this approach may be safer.
