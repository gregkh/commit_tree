blk-mq: make the sysfs mq/ layout reflect current mappings

Currently blk-mq registers all the hardware queues in sysfs,
regardless of whether it uses them (e.g. they have CPU mappings)
or not. The unused hardware queues lack the cpux/ directories,
and the other sysfs entries (like active, pending, etc) are all
zeroes.

Change this so that sysfs correctly reflects the current mappings
of the hardware queues.
