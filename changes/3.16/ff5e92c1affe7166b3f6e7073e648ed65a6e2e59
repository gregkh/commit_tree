net: sctp: propagate sysctl errors from proc_do* properly

sysctl handler proc_sctp_do_hmac_alg(), proc_sctp_do_rto_min() and
proc_sctp_do_rto_max() do not properly reflect some error cases
when writing values via sysctl from internal proc functions such
as proc_dointvec() and proc_dostring().

In all these cases we pass the test for write != 0 and partially
do additional work just to notice that additional sanity checks
fail and we return with hard-coded -EINVAL while proc_do*
functions might also return different errors. So fix this up by
simply testing a successful return of proc_do* right after
calling it.

This also allows to propagate its return value onwards to the user.
While touching this, also fix up some minor style issues.
