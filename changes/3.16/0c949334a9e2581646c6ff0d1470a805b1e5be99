iov_iter_truncate()

Now It Can Be Done(tm) - we don't need to do iov_shorten() in
generic_file_direct_write() anymore, now that all ->direct_IO()
instances are converted to proper iov_iter methods and honour
iter->count and iter->iov_offset properly.

Get rid of count/ocount arguments of generic_file_direct_write(),
while we are at it.
