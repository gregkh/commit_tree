drm/exynos: Fix de-registration ordering

'exynos_drm_pdev' was not getting unregistered if platform_driver_register()
failed. Fix the ordering to allow this. This also fixes the below warning by
moving the #endif macro. While at it also fix the ordering in the exit function
so that de-registration happens in opposite order of registration.

'err_unregister_pd' defined but not used [-Wunused-label]
