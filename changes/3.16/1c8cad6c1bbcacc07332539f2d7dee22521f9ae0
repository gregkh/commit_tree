xen-blkfront: remove type check from blkfront_setup_discard

In its initial implementation a check for "type" was added, but only phy
and file are handled. This breaks advertised discard support for other
type values such as qdisk.

Fix and simplify this function: If the backend advertises discard
support it is supposed to implement it properly, so enable
feature_discard unconditionally. If the backend advertises the need for
a certain granularity and alignment then propagate both properties to
the blocklayer. The discard-secure property is a boolean, update the code
to reflect that.
