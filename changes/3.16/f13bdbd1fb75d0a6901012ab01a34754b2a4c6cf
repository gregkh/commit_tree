drm/exynos: fimd: clear channel before enabling iommu

If any fimd channel was already active, initializing iommu will result
in a PAGE FAULT (e.e. u-boot could have turned on the display and
not disabled it before the kernel starts). This patch checks if any
channel is active before initializing iommu and disables it.
