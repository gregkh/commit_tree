mmc: sdhci: clean up sdhci_update_clock()/sdhci_set_clock()

Only one caller to sdhci_set_clock() needs to check whether the
requested clock frequency was the same as the currently set frequency,
yet we work around this in several other sites via sdhci_update_clock().
Rather than doing this, move those checks out into sdhci_do_set_ios(),
which then allows sdhci_update_clock() to be eliminated.
