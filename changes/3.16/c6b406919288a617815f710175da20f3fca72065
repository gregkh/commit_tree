x86, fpu: Extend the use of static_cpu_has_safe

It may be necessary to save and restore the FPU context during EFI runtime
system services calls. However, this may happen during boot and before
alternatives have run. Thus, we need to use static_cpu_has_safe instead.

The rationale behind the use of static_cpu_has_safe is the same as in
commit 5f8c4218148822fde6ee ("x86, fpu: Use static_cpu_has_safe
before alternatives") by Borislav Petkov.
