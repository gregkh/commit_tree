perf hists: Collapse expanded callchains after filter is applied

When a filter is applied a hist entry checks whether its callchain was
folded and account it to the output stat.  But this is rather hacky
and only TUI-specific.  Simply fold the callchains for the entry looks
like a simpler and more generic solution IMHO.
