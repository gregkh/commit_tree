clk: at91: add slow clks driver

AT91 slow clk is a clk multiplexer.

In some SoCs (sam9x5, sama5, sam9g45 families) this multiplexer can
choose among 2 sources: an internal RC oscillator circuit and an oscillator
using an external crystal.

In other Socs (sam9260 family) the multiplexer source is hardcoded with
the OSCSEL signal.
