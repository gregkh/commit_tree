scripts: objdiff: change the extension of disassembly from .o to .dis

Prior to this commit, the command "scripts/objdiff record path/to/*.o"
disassembled the given object into ".tmp_objdiff/path/to/*.o" file.

The problem here is that recorded disassemblies are lost if we run
"make clean" because it removes all the *.o files.
Disassembled code should be dumped into *.dis instead of *.o files.
