ARM: l2c: fix dependencies on PL310 errata symbols

A number of configurations spit out warnings similar to:

warning: (SOC_IMX6 && SOC_VF610 && ARCH_OMAP4) selects PL310_ERRATA_588369 which has unmet direct dependencies (CACHE_L2X0)
warning: (SOC_IMX6 && SOC_VF610 && ARCH_OMAP4) selects PL310_ERRATA_727915 which has unmet direct dependencies (CACHE_L2X0)

Clean up the dependencies here:
* PL310 symbols should only be selected when CACHE_L2X0 is enabled.
* Since the cache-l2x0 code detects PL310 presence at runtime, and we will
  eventually get rid of CACHE_PL310, surround these errata options with an
  if CACHE_L2X0 conditional rather than repeating the dependency against
  each.
