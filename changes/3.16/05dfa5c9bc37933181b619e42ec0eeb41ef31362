usb: host: max3421-hcd: fix "spi_rd8" uses dynamic stack allocation warning

kmalloc the SPI rx and tx data buffers.  This appears to be the only
portable way to guarantee that the buffers are DMA-safe (e.g., in
separate DMA cache-lines).  This patch makes the spi_rdX()/spi_wrX()
non-reentrant, but that's OK because calls to them are guaranteed to
be serialized by the per-HCD SPI-thread.
