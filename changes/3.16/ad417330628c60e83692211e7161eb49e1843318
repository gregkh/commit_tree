powerpc/powernv : Disable subcore for UP configs

Build throws following errors when CONFIG_SMP=n
arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/subcore.c: In function ‘cpu_update_split_mode’:
arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/subcore.c:274:15: error: ‘setup_max_cpus’ undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/subcore.c:285:5: error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment

'setup_max_cpus' variable is relevant only on SMP, so there is no point
working around it for UP. Furthermore, subcore itself is relevant only
on SMP and hence the better solution is to exclude subcore.o and
subcore-asm.o for UP builds.
