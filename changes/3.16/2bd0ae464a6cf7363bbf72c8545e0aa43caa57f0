ALSA: compress: Cancel the optimization of compiler and fix the size of struct for all platform.

Cancel the optimization of compiler for struct snd_compr_avail
which size will be 0x1c in 32bit kernel while 0x20 in 64bit
kernel under the optimizer. That will make compaction between
32bit and 64bit. So add packed to fix the size of struct
snd_compr_avail to 0x1c for all platform.
