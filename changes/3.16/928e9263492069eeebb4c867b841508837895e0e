tty: xuartps: Initialize ports according to aliases

Register port numbers according to order in DT aliases.
If aliases are not defined, order in DT is used.
If aliases are defined, register port id based
on that.
This patch ensures proper ttyPS0/1 assignment.

[soren]: Combined integer declarations in probe(), removed warning message
if no alias is found.
