ASoC: dapm: Revert "ASoC: dapm: Fix double prefix addition"

This reverts commit bd23c5b661858446267f4d6b2fb4edd8eb710dda.

The patch claims that the patch is necessary to avoid double prefix addition
when calling snd_soc_dapm_add_route() from snd_soc_dapm_connect_dai_link_widgets().
But snd_soc_dapm_add_route() is called with the card's DAPM context, which does
not have a prefix, which means there is no prefix that could be added a second
time.
