cfg80211: Fix GO Concurrent relaxation on UNII-3

At some locations, channels 149-165 are considered a single
bundle, while at some other locations, e.g., Indonesia, channels
149-161 are considered a single bundle, while channel 165 belongs
to a different bundle. This means that:

1. A station interface connection to an AP on channel 165 allows
   the instantiation of a P2P GO on channels 149-165.
2. A station interface connection to an AP on channels 149-161
   does NOT allow the instantiation of a P2P GO on channel 165.

Fix this.
