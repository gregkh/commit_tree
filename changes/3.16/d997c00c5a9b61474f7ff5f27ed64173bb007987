powerpc: Add ppc_global_function_entry()

ABIv2 has the concept of a global and local entry point to a function.
In most cases we are interested in the local entry point, and so that is
what ppc_function_entry() returns.

However we have a case in the ftrace code where we want the global entry
point, and there may be other places we need it too. Rather than special
casing each, add an accessor.

For ABIv1 and 32-bit there is only a single entry point, so we return
that. That means it's safe for the caller to use this without also
checking the ABI version.
