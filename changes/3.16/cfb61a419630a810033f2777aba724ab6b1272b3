mfd: AXP20x: Add mfd driver for AXP20x PMIC

This patch introduces the preliminary support for PMICs X-Powers AXP202
and AXP209. The AXP209 and AXP202 are the PMUs (Power Management Unit)
used by A10, A13 and A20 SoCs and developed by X-Powers, a sister company
of Allwinner.

The core enables support for two subsystems:
- PEK (Power Enable Key)
- Regulators
