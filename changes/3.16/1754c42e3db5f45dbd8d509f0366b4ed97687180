ARM: exynos: move sysram info to exynos.c

This solves a problem with building with CONFIG_SMP=n due to missing
sysram_base_addr (or sysram_ns_base_addr) variables.

The new setup method is more awkward than I'd like for it to be, but
it can't be done in init_early() since ioremap is not yet available,
but it needs to happen before SMP.
