powerpc/powernv: Don't escalate non-existing frozen PE

Commit cb5b242c ("powerpc/eeh: Escalate error on non-existing PE")
escalates the frozen state on non-existing PE to fenced PHB. It
was to improve kdump reliability. After that, commit 361f2a2a
("powrpc/powernv: Reset PHB in kdump kernel") was introduced to
issue complete reset on all PHBs to increase the reliability of
kdump kernel.

Commit cb5b242c becomes unuseful and it would be reverted.
