ARM: tegra: tegra_defconfig updates

AT24C EEPROM:

This is used for the board ID EEPROM on Jetson TK1, as well as likely
a whole slew of other NVIDIA reference boards; we simply haven't added
enabled the EEPROM in the DT files until now.

MTD_SPI_NOR:

This defconfig contains the CONFIG_M25P80 symbol, which is now
dependent on the MTD_SPI_NOR symbol. Add CONFIG_MTD_SPI_NOR to satisfy
the new dependency.

FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_ROTATION:

Needed for devices like Tegra Note 7 and NVIDIA SHIELD to get the boot
console in the expected orientation.

CAN*, RTC_DRV_DS1307:

Toradex Colibri Evaluation Board uses the DS1307 RTC and the MCP251x CAN
controller. The NVIDIA Tegra 3 based Colibri T30 module can be used on
this carrier board.

Furthermore the NVIDIA Tegra 3 based Apalis T30 module too contains two
MCP251x CAN controllers.

INPUT_JOYDEV:

NVIDIA SHIELD embeds a USB joystick device.
