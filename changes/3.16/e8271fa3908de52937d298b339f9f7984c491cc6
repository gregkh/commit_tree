f2fs: avoid BUG_ON when mouting corrupted image having garbage blocks

If the disk has some garbage blocks, F2FS is able to face with BUG_ON when
recovering direct node blocks.
This patch detects the error case and avoids that prior to reaching BUG_ON.

Alexey Khoroshilov addressed the potential security issues as follows.
"An ability to trigger a BUG_ON assert by mounting a crafted image is
usually considered as a local denial of service [1-3]. As far as I
understand, the reason is that some kernel data may become inconsistent
that can lead to further problems.
