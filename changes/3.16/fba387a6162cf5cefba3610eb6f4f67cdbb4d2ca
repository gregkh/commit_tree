ARM: dts: DRA7: Use dra7-l3-noc instead of omap4-l3-noc

We have currently marked the DRA7 L3 as being compatible with
omap4-l3-noc This is not true considering the differences in data
involved.

Now that we have proper support for ti,dra7-l3-noc, add the clock
modules clk1 and clk3 (clk2 submodule will be handled by the driver)
and switch compatibility flag to use the proper data.
