[media] media: stk1160: Avoid stack-allocated buffer for control URBs

Currently stk1160_read_reg() uses a stack-allocated char to get the
read control value. This is wrong because usb_control_msg() requires
a kmalloc-ed buffer.

This commit fixes such issue by kmalloc'ating a 1-byte buffer to receive
the read value.

While here, let's remove the urb_buf array which was meant for a similar
purpose, but never really used.
