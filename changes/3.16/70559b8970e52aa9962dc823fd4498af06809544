net: cdc_ncm: use true max dgram count for header estimates

Many newer NCM and MBIM devices will request a maximum tx
datagram count which is much smaller than our hard-coded
absolute max. We can reduce the overhead without sacrificing
any of the simplicity for these devices, by simply using the
true negotiated count in when calculated the maximum NTH and
NDP header sizes.
