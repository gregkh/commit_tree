mm: memcontrol: remove hierarchy restrictions for swappiness and oom_control

Per-memcg swappiness and oom killing can currently not be tweaked on a
memcg that is part of a hierarchy, but not the root of that hierarchy.
Users have complained that they can't configure this when they turned on
hierarchy mode.  In fact, with hierarchy mode becoming the default, this
restriction disables the tunables entirely.

But there is no good reason for this restriction.  The settings for
swappiness and OOM killing are taken from whatever memcg whose limit
triggered reclaim and OOM invocation, regardless of its position in the
hierarchy tree.

Allow setting swappiness on any group.  The knob on the root memcg
already reads the global VM swappiness, make it writable as well.

Allow disabling the OOM killer on any non-root memcg.
