dm cache: fix race affecting dirty block count

nr_dirty is updated without locking, causing it to drift so that it is
non-zero (either a small positive integer, or a very large one when an
underflow occurs) even when there are no actual dirty blocks.  This was
due to a race between the workqueue and map function accessing nr_dirty
in parallel without proper protection.

People were seeing under runs due to a race on increment/decrement of
nr_dirty, see: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/3/648

Fix this by using an atomic_t for nr_dirty.
