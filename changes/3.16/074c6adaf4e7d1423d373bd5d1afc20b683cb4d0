drm/i915: Mark device as wedged if we fail to resume

During module load, if we fail to initialise the rings, we abort the
load reporting EIO. However during resume, even though we report EIO as
we fail to reinitialize the ringbuffers, the resume continues and the
device is restored - albeit in a non-functional state. As we cannot
execute any commands on the GPU, it is effectively wedged, mark it so.

As we now preserve the ringbuffers across resume, this should prevent
UXA from falling into the trap of repeatedly sending invalid
batchbuffers and dropping all further rendering into /dev/null.
