arm64: topology: Initialise default topology state immediately

As a legacy of the way 32 bit ARM did things the topology code uses a null
topology map by default and then overwrites it by mapping cores with no
information to a cluster by themselves later. In order to make it simpler
to reset things as part of recovering from parse failures in firmware
information directly set this configuration on init. A core will always be
its own sibling so there should be no risk of confusion with firmware
provided information.
