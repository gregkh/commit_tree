mac80211: refactor ieee80211_assign/unassign_vif_chanctx into one

Combine the functions into one, so that we can switch from one context
to the other without having to unassign and assign separately.  This
is needed by the channel reservation functionality because otherwise
we have a small period of time when the chanctx is set to NULL, which
can cause problems if someone else is trying to dereference it.
