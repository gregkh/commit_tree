perf tools: Consolidate output field handling to hpp format routines

Until now the hpp and sort functions do similar jobs different ways.
Since the sort functions converted/wrapped to hpp formats it can do
the job in a uniform way.

The perf_hpp__sort_list has a list of hpp formats to sort entries and
the perf_hpp__list has a list of hpp formats to print output result.

To have a backward compatibility, it automatically adds 'overhead'
field in front of sort list.  And then all of fields in sort list
added to the output list (if it's not already there).
