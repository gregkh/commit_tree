cfg80211: allow drivers to iterate over matching combinations

The patch splits cfg80211_check_combinations()
into an iterator function and a simple iteration
user.

This makes it possible for drivers to asses how
many channels can use given iftype setup. This in
turn can be used for future
multi-interface/multi-channel channel switching.
