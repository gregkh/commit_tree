sched/numa: Update migrate_improves/degrades_locality()

Update the migrate_improves/degrades_locality() functions with
knowledge of pseudo-interleaving.

Do not consider moving tasks around within the set of group's active
nodes as improving or degrading locality. Instead, leave the load
balancer free to balance the load between a numa_group's active nodes.

Also, switch from the group/task_weight functions to the group/task_fault
functions. The "weight" functions involve a division, but both calls use
the same divisor, so there's no point in doing that from these functions.

On a 4 node (x10 core) system, performance of SPECjbb2005 seems
unaffected, though the number of migrations with 2 8-warehouse wide
instances seems to have almost halved, due to the scheduler running
each instance on a single node.
