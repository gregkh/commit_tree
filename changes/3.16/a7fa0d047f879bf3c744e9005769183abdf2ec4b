ALSA: firewire-lib: Rename macros, variables and functions for CMP

Referring to IEC 61883-1, oMPR and iMPR, oPCR and iPCR have some fields with
the same role in the same position. This patch renames some macros, variables
and function arguments with "i" in its prefix to reuse them between oMPR and
iMPR, oPCR and iPCR.
