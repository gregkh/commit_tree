perf tools: Use tid for finding thread

I believe that passing pid (instead of tid) as the 3rd arg of the
machine__find*_thread() was to find a main thread so that it can
search proper map group for symbols.  However with the map sharing
patch applied, it now can do it in any thread.

It fixes a bug when each thread has different name, it only reports a
main thread for samples in other threads.
