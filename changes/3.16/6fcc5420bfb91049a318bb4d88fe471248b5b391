direct-io: fix uninitialized warning in do_direct_IO()

The following warnings:

  fs/direct-io.c: In function ‘__blockdev_direct_IO’:
  fs/direct-io.c:1011:12: warning: ‘to’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  fs/direct-io.c:913:16: note: ‘to’ was declared here
  fs/direct-io.c:1011:12: warning: ‘from’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  fs/direct-io.c:913:10: note: ‘from’ was declared here

are false positive because dio_get_page() either fails, or sets both
'from' and 'to'.

Maybe it's better to move initializing "to" and "from" out of
dio_get_page(). That _might_ make it easier for both the the reader and
the compiler to understand what's going on. Something like this:

The fix of moving the code definitively looks nicer, while I think
uninitialized_var is horrible wart that won't get anywhere near my code.

Boaz Harrosh: I agree with Christoph and Paul
