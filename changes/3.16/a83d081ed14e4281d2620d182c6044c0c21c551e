MIPS: BPF JIT: Fix build error.

  mips: allmodconfig fails in 3.16-rc1 with lots of undefined symbols.

  arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c: In function 'is_load_to_a':
  arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c:559:7: error: 'BPF_S_LD_W_LEN' undeclared (first use in this function)
  arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c:559:7: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
  arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c:560:7: error: 'BPF_S_LD_W_ABS' undeclared (first use in this function)
  [...]

The reason behind this is that 3480593131e0 ("net: filter: get rid of
BPF_S_* enum") was routed via net-next tree, that takes all BPF-related
changes, at a time where MIPS BPF JIT was not part of net-next, while
c6610de353da ("MIPS: net: Add BPF JIT") was routed via mips arch tree
and went into mainline within the same merge window. Thus, fix it up by
converting BPF_S_* in a similar fashion as in 3480593131e0 for MIPS.
