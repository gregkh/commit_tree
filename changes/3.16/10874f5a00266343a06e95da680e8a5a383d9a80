PCI: Remove unnecessary __ref annotations

Some PCI functions used to be marked __devinit.  When CONFIG_HOTPLUG was
not set, these functions were discarded after boot.  A few callers of these
__devinit functions were marked __ref to indicate that they could safely
call the __devinit functions even though the callers were not __devinit.

But CONFIG_HOTPLUG and __devinit are now gone, and the need for the __ref
annotations is also gone, so remove them.  Relevant historical commits:
