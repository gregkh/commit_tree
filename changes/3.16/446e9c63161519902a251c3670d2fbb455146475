ARM: tegra: initial add of Colibri T30

This patch adds the device tree to support Toradex Colibri T30, a
computer on module which can be used on different carrier boards.

The module consists of a Tegra 30 SoC, two PMIC, DDR3L RAM, eMMC,
a LM95245 temperature sensor and an AX88772B USB Ethernet
Controller. Furthermore, there is a STMPE811 and SGTL5000 audio
codec which are not yet supported. Anything that is not self
contained on the module is disabled by default.

The device tree for the Evaluation Board includes the modules
device tree and enables the supported pheripherials of the carrier
board (the Evaluation Board supports almost all of them).
