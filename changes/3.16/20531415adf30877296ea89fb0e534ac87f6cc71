ALSA: hda - Add a new quirk match based on default pin configuration

Normally, we match on pci ssid only. This works but needs new code
for every machine. To catch more machines in the same quirk, let's add
a new type of quirk, where we match on
 1) PCI Subvendor ID (i e, not device, just vendor)
 2) Codec ID
 3) Pin configuration default

If all these three match, we could be reasonably certain that the
quirk should apply to the machine even though it might not be the
exact same device.
