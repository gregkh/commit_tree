ARM: EXYNOS: Move some code inside the idle_finisher for cpuidle

Move the code around to differentiate different section of code and
prepare it to be factored out in the next patches.

The call order changed but hat doesn't have a side effect because
they are independent. The important call is cpu_do_idle() which must
be done the last.
