drm/i915: Track has_audio in the pipe config

Including state readout and cross-checking. This allows us to get rid
of crtc->eld_vld on hsw+. It also means that fastboot will be unhappy
if the BIOS hasn't set up the audio routing like we want it too.

Wrt fastboot and external screens I see a few options:
- Don't.
- Try to fix up eld, infoframes and audio settings after the fact. But
  that means some pretty extensive reworking of our code which
  currently does all this while the pipe/port is still off.

I won't bother with converting SDVO over to this because the audio
support for SDVO is very lacking:
- We don't update the eld.
- We don't update the audio state on the sdvo encoder.
- We don't check whether the platform can even feed audio to the sdvo
  encoder.

I've converted hdmi, dp & ddi all in one go since ddi needs both hdmi
and dp converted and so doing it step-by-step would have required a
few intermediate hacks.
