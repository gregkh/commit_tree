net: filter: improve filter block macros

Commit 9739eef13c92 ("net: filter: make BPF conversion more readable")
started to introduce helper macros similar to BPF_STMT()/BPF_JUMP()
macros from classic BPF.

However, quite some statements in the filter conversion functions
remained in the old style which gives a mixture of block macros and
non block macros in the code. This patch makes the block macros itself
more readable by using explicit member initialization, and converts
the remaining ones where possible to remain in a more consistent state.
