ARM: 8036/1: Enable IRQs before attempting to read user space in __und_usr

The Undef abort handler in the kernel reads the undefined instruction
from user space. If the page table was modified from another CPU, the
user access could fail and do_page_fault() will be executed with
interrupts disabled. This can potentially deadlock on ARM11MPCore or on
Cortex-A15 with erratum 798181 workaround enabled (both implying IPI for
TLB maintenance with page table lock held).

This patch enables the IRQs in __und_usr before attempting to read the
instruction from user space.
