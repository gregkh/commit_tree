powerpc/fsl-booke: Add initial T104x_QDS board support

Add support for T104x board in board file t104x_qds.c, It is common for
 both T1040 and T1042 as they share same QDS board.

 T1040QDS board Overview
 -----------------------
 - SERDES Connections, 8 lanes supporting:
      — PCI Express: supporting Gen 1 and Gen 2;
      — SGMII
      — QSGMII
      — SATA 2.0
      — Aurora debug with dedicated connectors (T1040 only)
 - DDR Controller
     - Supports rates of up to 1600 MHz data-rate
     - Supports one DDR3LP UDIMM/RDIMMs, of single-, dual- or quad-rank types.
 -IFC/Local Bus
