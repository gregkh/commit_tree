hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Use the manufacturer name properly

Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd is the vendor for
NTC (Negative Temperature coefficient) based Thermistors.
But, the driver extensively uses "NTC" as the vendor name.

This patch corrects the vendor name also updates the
compatibility strings according to the vendor-prefix.txt

Note: Drivers continue to support the previous compatible strings
but further addition of these compatible strings in device tree
is deprecated.
