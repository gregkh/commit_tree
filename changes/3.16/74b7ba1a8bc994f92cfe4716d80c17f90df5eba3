qlcnic: Add support to process commands in atomic context

o Commands from VF may sleep during PF-VF communication.
  Earlier we use to process qlcnic_sriov_vf_set_multi
  function in process context. Now individual commands
  that are called in atomic context are processed in
  process context without waiting for completion of
  command.
