block: ensure that bio_add_page() always accepts a page for an empty bio

With commit 762380ad9322 added support for chunk sizes and no merging
across them, it broke the rule of always allowing adding of a single
page to an empty bio. So relax the restriction a bit to allow for that,
similarly to what we have always done.

This fixes a crash with mkfs.xfs and 512b sector sizes on NVMe.
