uprobes/x86: Introduce uprobe_xol_ops and arch_uprobe->ops

Introduce arch_uprobe->ops pointing to the "struct uprobe_xol_ops",
move the current UPROBE_FIX_{RIP*,IP,CALL} code into the default
set of methods and change arch_uprobe_pre/post_xol() accordingly.

This way we can add the new uprobe_xol_ops's to handle the insns
which need the special processing (rip-relative jmp/call at least).
