mtip32xx: Fix ERO and NoSnoop values in PCIe upstream on AMD systems

A hardware quirk in P320h/P420m interfere with PCIe transactions on some
AMD chipsets, making P320h/P420m unusable. This workaround is to disable
ERO and NoSnoop bits in the parent and root complex for normal
functioning of these devices

NOTE: This workaround is specific to AMD chipset with a PCIe upstream
device with device id 0x5aXX
