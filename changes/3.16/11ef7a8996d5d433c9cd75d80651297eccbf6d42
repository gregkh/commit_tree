net: Performance fix for process_backlog

In process_backlog the input_pkt_queue is only checked once for new
packets and quota is artificially reduced to reflect precisely the
number of packets on the input_pkt_queue so that the loop exits
appropriately.

This patches changes the behavior to be more straightforward and
less convoluted. Packets are processed until either the quota
is met or there are no more packets to process.

This patch seems to provide a small, but noticeable performance
improvement. The performance improvement is a result of staying
in the process_backlog loop longer which can reduce number of IPI's.
