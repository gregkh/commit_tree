usb: phy: msm: Correct USB PHY Reset sequence for newer platform

On few legacy platforms, USB PHY is having dedicated reset clk.
It is used to reset USB PHY after putting USB PHY into low power
mode and for calibration of USB PHY. Putting USB PHY into low
power mode is causing ulpi read/write timeout as expected. USB PHY
reset clk is not available on newer platform.

For 28nm PHY, reset USB PHY after resetting USB LINK.
Also reset USB PHY using USB_PHY_PON bit with USB_OTG_HS_PHY_CTRL
register after programming USB PHY Override registers as suggested
with hardware programming guidelines.
