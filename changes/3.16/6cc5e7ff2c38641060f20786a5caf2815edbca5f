uprobes/x86: Emulate relative conditional "near" jmp's

Change branch_setup_xol_ops() to simply use opc1 = OPCODE2(insn) - 0x10
if OPCODE1() == 0x0f; this matches the "short" jmp which checks the same
condition.

Thanks to lib/insn.c, it does the rest correctly. branch->ilen/offs are
correct no matter if this jmp is "near" or "short".
