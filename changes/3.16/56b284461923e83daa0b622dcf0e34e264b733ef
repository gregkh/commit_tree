crypto: s5p-sss - fix multiplatform build

As we are preparing to enable multiplatform support on EXYNOS,
we can no longer include mach/*.h or plat/*.h headers from device
drivers.

The s5p-sss driver was just enabled for EXYNOS when it used to
be used only on s5pv210, and it includes two samsung platform
specific header files for historic reasons. Fortunately, it no
longer actually needs them, so we can remove the #includes and
avoid the problem
