swiotlb: don't assume PA 0 is invalid

In 2.6.29 io_tlb_orig_addr[] got converted from storing virtual addresses
to storing physical ones. While checking virtual addresses against NULL
is a legitimate thing to catch invalid entries, checking physical ones
against zero isn't: There's no guarantee that PFN 0 is reserved on a
particular platform.

Since it is unclear whether the check in swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single() is
actually needed, retain it but check against a guaranteed invalid physical
address. This requires setting up the array in a suitable fashion. And
since the original code failed to invalidate array entries when regions
get unmapped, this is being fixed at once along with adding a similar
check to swiotlb_tbl_sync_single().

Obviously the less intrusive change would be to simply drop the check in
swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single().
