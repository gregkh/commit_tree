timer_stats/doc: Fix /proc/timer_stats documentation

Documentation/timers/timer_stats.txt claims:

 "The readout of /proc/timer_stats automatically disables sampling. The sampled
  information is kept until a new sample period is started. This allows multiple
  readouts."

Some simple testing shows that reading from /proc/timer_stats
does not disable sampling. Looking back over past source code,
it appears that it never did.
