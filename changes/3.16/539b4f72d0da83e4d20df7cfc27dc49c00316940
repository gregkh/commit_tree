staging/rtl8192u: Put EXPORT_SYMBOL just after the exported function

Export of symbols statement must be placed right after the definition to meet
kernel coding style guidelines. This issue was reported by checkpatch.

A simplified version of the semantic patch that makes this change is as
follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

// <smpl>

@ r @ identifier f; @@
- EXPORT_SYMBOL(f);

@@ identifier r.f; @@
  f(...) { ... }
+ EXPORT_SYMBOL(f);

// </smpl>
