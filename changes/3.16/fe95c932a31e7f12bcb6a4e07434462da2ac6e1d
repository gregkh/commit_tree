drivers: sh: pm_runtime does not need idle callback

In the runtime_pm idle callback the code assumes that a NULL .runtime_idle
entry is the same as a .runtime_idle entry that returns 0 as a result. This
means the entry in drivers/sh/pm_runtime can be removed in favour of just
leaving the entry NULL.
