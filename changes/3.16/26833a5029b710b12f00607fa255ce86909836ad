powerpc/eeh: Make the delay for PE reset unified

Basically, we have 3 types of resets to fulfil PE reset: fundamental,
hot and PHB reset. For the later 2 cases, we need PCI bus reset hold
and settlement delay as specified by PCI spec. PowerNV and pSeries
platforms are running on top of different firmware and some of the
delays have been covered by underly firmware (PowerNV).

The patch makes the delays unified to be done in backend, instead of
EEH core.
