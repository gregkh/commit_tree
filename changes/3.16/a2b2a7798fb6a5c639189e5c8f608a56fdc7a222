ALSA: bebob: Send a cue to load firmware for M-Audio Firewire series

Just powering on, these devices below wait to download firmware.
 - Firewire Audiophile
 - Firewire 410
 - Firewire 1814
 - ProjectMix I/O

But firmware version 5058 or later, flash memory in the device stores the
firmware. So this driver can enable these devices by sending a certain cue to
load the firmware.
