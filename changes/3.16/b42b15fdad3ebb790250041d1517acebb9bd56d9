lustre: get rid of messing with iovecs

* switch to ->read_iter/->write_iter
* keep a pointer to iov_iter instead of iov/nr_segs
* do not modify iovecs; use iov_iter_truncate()/iov_iter_advance() and
a new primitive - iov_iter_reexpand() (expand previously truncated
iterator) istead.
* (racy) check for lustre VMAs intersecting with iovecs kept for now as
for_each_iov() loop.
