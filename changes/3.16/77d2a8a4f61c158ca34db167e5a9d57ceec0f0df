ALSA: firewire-lib: Add support for channel mapping

Some devices arrange the position of PCM/MIDI data channel in AMDTP packet.
This commit allows drivers to set channel mapping.

To be simple, the mapping table is an array with fixed length. Then the number
of channels for PCM is restricted by 64 channels.
