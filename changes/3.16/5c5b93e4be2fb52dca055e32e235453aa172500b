Bluetooth: Fix address in unmergeable device found events

When sending out a device found event caused by an advertising report in
the situation where we couldn't store the report as a pending one, the
code was incorrectly trying to use the address and address type from the
pending data. Since the pending data is cleared in the previous line
this causes a potentially incorrect address type and an address of
BDADDR_ANY. This patch fixes the call to use the address information
correctly from the received advertising report.
