cpufreq: Introduce macros for cpufreq_frequency_table iteration

Many cpufreq drivers need to iterate over the cpufreq_frequency_table
for various tasks.

This patch introduces two macros which can be used for iteration over
cpufreq_frequency_table keeping a common coding style across drivers:

- cpufreq_for_each_entry: iterate over each entry of the table
- cpufreq_for_each_valid_entry: iterate over each entry that contains
a valid frequency.

It should have no functional changes.
