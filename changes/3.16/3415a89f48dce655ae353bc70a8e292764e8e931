[media] vb2: add thread support

In order to implement vb2 DVB support you need to be able to start
a kernel thread that queues and dequeues buffers, calling a callback
function for every buffer. This patch adds support for that.

It's based on drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf-dvb.c, but with all the DVB
specific stuff stripped out, thus making it much more generic.
