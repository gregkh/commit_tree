dma: cppi41: handle 0-length packets

When a 0-length packet is received on the bus, desc->pd0 yields 1,
which confuses the driver's users. This information is clearly wrong
and not in accordance to the datasheet, but it's been observed on an
AM335x board, very reproducible.

Fix this by looking at bit 19 in PD2 of the completed packet. This bit
will tell us if a zero-length packet was received on a queue. If it's
set, ignore the value in PD0 and report a total length of 0 instead.
