ALSA: firewire-lib: Add some AV/C general commands

This commit adds three commands, which may be used by some firewire device
drivers. These commands are defined in 'AV/C Digital Interface Command Set
General Specification Version 4.2 (2004006, 1394TA)'.

1. PLUG INFO command (clause 10.1)
2. INPUT PLUG SIGNAL FORMAT command (clause 10.10)
3. OUTPUT PLUG SIGNAL FORMAT command (clause 10.11)

By the command 1, the drivers can get the number of plugs for AV/C unit or
subunit.
By the command 2 and 3, the drivers can get/set sampling frequency.

The 'firewire-speakers' already uses INPUT PLUG SIGNAL FORMAT command to set
sampling rate. So this commit also affects the driver.
