mtd: cfi_cmdset_0001.c: add support for Sharp LH28F640BF NOR

This family of chips was long ago supported by the pre-cfi driver.
CFI code tested on several Zaurus SL-5500 (Collie) 2x16 on 32 bit bus.

Function is_LH28F640BF() mimics is_m29ew() from cmdset_0002.c

Buffer write fixes as seen in 2007 patch c/o

[Brian: this patch is semi-urgent, because the following patch switches
  to using CFI detection for a chip which (until now) is unsupported by
  the CFI driver
