nfs: call nfs_can_coalesce_requests for every req

Call nfs_can_coalesce_requests for every request, even the first one.
This is needed for future patches to give pg_test a way to inform
add_request to reduce the size of the request.

Now @prev can be null in nfs_can_coalesce_requests and pg_test functions.
