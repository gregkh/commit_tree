drm/i915: Sprinkle intel_edp_psr_update over crtc_enable/disable

My plan here is to split up set_base into a prepare step, which does
the pinning, and a commit stage, which updates the hw state. Eventually
we should be able to move the prepare step at the beginning of any
atomic update. For now I only want to move the commit step into the
crtc_enable callbacks.

As a prep step sprinkle intel_edp_psr_update all over the place so
that we don't have to concern ourselves with that in the commit step.

v2: Rebase on top of Ville's enable/disable functions for all planes.

v3: Rebase more.
