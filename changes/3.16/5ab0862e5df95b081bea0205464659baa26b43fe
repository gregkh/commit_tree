Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: MMP audio needs sram support

Building the pxa/mmp audio driver without support for the mmp
sram driver enabled results in this link error:

sound/built-in.o: In function `mmp_pcm_free_dma_buffers':
:(.text+0x3e734): undefined reference to `sram_get_gpool'
sound/built-in.o: In function `mmp_pcm_new':
:(.text+0x3e7c0): undefined reference to `sram_get_gpool'

The sram driver is cannot be manually enabled and needs to
be turned on by selecting MMP_SRAM from each module that
needs it, which is what this patch does.

Ideally, MMP should move over to the generic SRAM support, but
for the moment, we can avoid the build error.
