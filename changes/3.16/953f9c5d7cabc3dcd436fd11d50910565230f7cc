ARM: mvebu: don't use clocks property in UART node for Netgear RN2120

The Netgear RN2120 was not using the same strategy as the other Armada
370/375/38x/XP boards: it was using a 'clocks' property and not the
'clock-frequency' property in its UART controller Device Tree node.

However, now that this clock reference is present at the SoC-level,
there is no point in duplicating it at the board-level.
