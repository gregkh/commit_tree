mtd: eLBC NAND: fix subpage write support

As subpage write is enabled by default for all drivers, nand_write_subpage_hwecc
causes a crash if the driver did not register ecc->hwctl or ecc->calculate.
This behavior was introduced in
   commit 837a6ba4f3b6d23026674e6af6b6849a4634fff9
   "mtd: nand: subpage write support for hardware based ECC schemes".

This fixes a crash by emulating subpage write support by padding sub-page data
with 0xff on either sides to make it full page compatible.
