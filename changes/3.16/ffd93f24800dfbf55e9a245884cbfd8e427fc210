    drm/i915: Catch dirt in unused execbuffer fields

Comment from Chris' review:

"To be fair, it is a sensible value if one supposes a Region style API to
cliprects. Under that API, DR[14] define the extents of the clip region,
and ((0,0), (0,0)) [DR1==DR4==0] would mean all clipped, do not draw
anything."
