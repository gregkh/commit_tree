blk-mq: fix race with timeouts and requeue events

If a requeue event races with a timeout, we can get into the
situation where we attempt to complete a request from the
timeout handler when it's not start anymore. This causes a crash.
So have the timeout handler check that REQ_ATOM_STARTED is still
set on the request - if not, we ignore the event. If this happens,
the request has now been marked as complete. As a consequence, we
need to ensure to clear REQ_ATOM_COMPLETE in blk_mq_start_request(),
as to maintain proper request state.
