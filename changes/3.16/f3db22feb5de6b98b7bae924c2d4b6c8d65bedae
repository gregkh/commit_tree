NVMe: Fix hot cpu notification dead lock

There is a potential dead lock if a cpu event occurs during nvme probe
since it registered with hot cpu notification. This fixes the race by
having the module register with notification outside of probe rather
than have each device register.

The actual work is done in a scheduled work queue instead of in the
notifier since assigning IO queues has the potential to block if the
driver creates additional queues.
