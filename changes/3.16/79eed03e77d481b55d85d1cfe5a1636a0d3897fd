USB: usb_wwan: fix urb leak at shutdown

The delayed-write queue was never emptied at shutdown (close), something
which could lead to leaked urbs if the port is closed before being
runtime resumed due to a write.

When this happens the output buffer would not drain on close
(closing_wait timeout), and after consecutive opens, writes could be
corrupted with previously buffered data, transfered with reduced
throughput or completely blocked.

Note that unbusy_queued_urb() was simply moved out of CONFIG_PM.

option driver")
