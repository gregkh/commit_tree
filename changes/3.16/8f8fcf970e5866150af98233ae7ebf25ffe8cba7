iommu/exynos: Remove prefetch buffer setting

Prefetch buffer is a cache of System MMU 3.x and caches a block of
page table entries to make effect of larger page with small pages.
However, how to control prefetch buffers and the specifications of
prefetch buffers different from minor versions of System MMU v3.
Prefetch buffers must be controled with care because there are some
restrictions in H/W design.

The interface and implementation to initiate prefetch buffers will
be prepared later.
