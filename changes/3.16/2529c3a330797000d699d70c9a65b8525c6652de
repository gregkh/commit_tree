clocksource: Add Freescale FlexTimer Module (FTM) timer support

The Freescale FlexTimer Module time reference is a 16-bit counter
that can be used as an unsigned or signed increase counter.

CNTIN defines the starting value of the count and MOD defines the
final value of the count. The value of CNTIN is loaded into the FTM
counter, and the counter increments until the value of MOD is reached,
at which point the counter is reloaded with the value of CNTIN. That's
also when an overflow interrupt will be generated.

Here using the 'evt' prefix or postfix as clock event device and
the 'src' as clock source device.
