ARM: mvebu: refine which files are build in mach-mvebu

Following the integration into mach-mvebu of the Kirkwood ARMv5
support, we need to be more careful about which files get built. For
example, the pmsu.c file now calls wfi(), which only exists on ARMv7
platforms.

Therefore, this commit changes mach-mvebu/Makefile to build the Armada
370/XP/375/38x specific files only when CONFIG_MACH_MVEBU_V7 is
enabled.
