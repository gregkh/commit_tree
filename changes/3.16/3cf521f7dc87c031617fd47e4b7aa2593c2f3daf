net/l2tp: don't fall back on UDP [get|set]sockopt

The l2tp [get|set]sockopt() code has fallen back to the UDP functions
for socket option levels != SOL_PPPOL2TP since day one, but that has
never actually worked, since the l2tp socket isn't an inet socket.

As David Miller points out:

  "If we wanted this to work, it'd have to look up the tunnel and then
   use tunnel->sk, but I wonder how useful that would be"

Since this can never have worked so nobody could possibly have depended
on that functionality, just remove the broken code and return -EINVAL.
