cgroup: remove css_parent()

cgroup in general is moving towards using cgroup_subsys_state as the
fundamental structural component and css_parent() was introduced to
convert from using cgroup->parent to css->parent.  It was quite some
time ago and we're moving forward with making css more prominent.

This patch drops the trivial wrapper css_parent() and let the users
dereference css->parent.  While at it, explicitly mark fields of css
which are public and immutable.

v2: New usage from device_cgroup.c converted.
