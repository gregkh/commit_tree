bonding: populate essential new_slave->bond/dev early

The new bond_free_slave() needs new_slave->bond to verify if additional
structures were allocated, so populate it early so that, in case of failure
in bond_enslave(), we would be able to get it.

Also populate the new_slave->dev field, as it's too one of the most needed
things to assign early.
