ixgbe: extract PTP clock device from ptp_init

In order to properly handle a suspend/resume cycle, we cannot destroy
the PTP clock device. As part of this, we should only re-create the
device on first initialization. After a resume, when ixgbe_ptp_init is
called, we won't create a new clock, and we will use the old clock
device. To that end, this patch extracts the clock creation out of
ptp_init, and only calls it if we don't already have a ptp_clock
pointer.
