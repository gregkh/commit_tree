powerpc: Fix SMP issues with ppc64le ABIv2

There is no need to put a function descriptor in
__secondary_hold_spinloop. Use ppc_function_entry to get the
instruction address and put it in __secondary_hold_spinloop instead.

Also fix an issue where we assumed cur_cpu_spec held a function
descriptor.
