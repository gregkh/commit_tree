KVM: support any-length wildcard ioeventfd

It is sometimes benefitial to ignore IO size, and only match on address.
In hindsight this would have been a better default than matching length
when KVM_IOEVENTFD_FLAG_DATAMATCH is not set, In particular, this kind
of access can be optimized on VMX: there no need to do page lookups.
This can currently be done with many ioeventfds but in a suboptimal way.

However we can't change kernel/userspace ABI without risk of breaking
some applications.
Use len = 0 to mean "ignore length for matching" in a more optimal way.
