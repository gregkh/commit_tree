net/mlx4_en: cq->irq_desc wasn't set in legacy EQ's

Fix a regression introduced by commit 35f6f45 ("net/mlx4_en: Don't use
irq_affinity_notifier to track changes in IRQ affinity map").
When core is started in legacy EQ's (number of IRQ's < rx rings), cq->irq_desc
was NULL.  This caused a kernel crash under heavy traffic - when having more
than rx NAPI budget completions.
Fixed to have it set for both EQ modes.
