drm/i915: Fix assert_plane warning during FDI link train

assert_plane_enabled() is now triggering during FDI link train because
we no longer enable planes that early.

This problem got introduced in:

    drm/i915: Disable/enable planes as the first/last thing during modeset on ILK+

Just drop the assert since we shouldn't need planes for link training.
