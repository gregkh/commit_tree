usb: usb5303: add support for reference clock specified in device tree

USB3503 chip supports 8 values of reference clock. The value is
specified by REF_SEL[1:0] pins and INT_N line. This patch add support
for getting 'refclk' clock, enabling it and setting INT_N line according
to the value of the gathered clock. If no clock has been specified,
driver defaults to the old behaviour (assuming that clock has been
specified by REF_SEL pins from primary reference clock frequencies
table).
