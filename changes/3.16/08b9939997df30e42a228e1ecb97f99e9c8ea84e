Revert "mac80211: move "bufferable MMPDU" check to fix AP mode scan"

This reverts commit 277d916fc2e959c3f106904116bb4f7b1148d47a as it was
at least breaking iwlwifi by setting the IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_PS_BUFFER
flag in all kinds of interface modes, not only for AP mode where it is
appropriate.

To avoid reintroducing the original problem, explicitly check for probe
request frames in the multicast buffering code.
