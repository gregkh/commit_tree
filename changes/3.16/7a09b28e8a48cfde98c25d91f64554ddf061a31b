ARM: l2c: omap2: avoid reading directly from the L2 registers in platform code

Avoid reading directly from the L2 registers in platform code.  The L2
code will have already saved the register values itself into the
l2x0_saved_regs structure, so platform code should just move these
values to where they're required.

This is safe because the L2x0 will have been initialised by an early
initcall, whereas the OMAP4 PM code is initialised late.
