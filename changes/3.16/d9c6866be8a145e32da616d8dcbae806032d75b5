of: kill off of_can_translate_address

of_can_translate_address only checks some conditions for address
translation, but does not check other conditions like having range
properties. The checks it does do are redundant with
__of_address_translate. The only difference is printing a message or
not. Since we only have a single caller that does the full translation
anyway, just remove of_can_translate_address and quiet the error
message.
