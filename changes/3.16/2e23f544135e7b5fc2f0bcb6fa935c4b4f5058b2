KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Expose EBB registers

POWER8 introduces a new facility called the "Event Based Branch" facility.
It contains of a few registers that indicate where a guest should branch to
when a defined event occurs and it's in PR mode.

We don't want to really enable EBB as it will create a big mess with !PR guest
mode while hardware is in PR and we don't really emulate the PMU anyway.

So instead, let's just leave it at emulation of all its registers.
