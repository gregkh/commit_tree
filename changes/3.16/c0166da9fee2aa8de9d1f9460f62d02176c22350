mac80211: compute chanctx refcount on-the-fly

It doesn't make much sense to store refcount in
the chanctx structure. One still needs to hold
chanctx_mtx to get the value safely. Besides,
refcount isn't on performance critical paths.

This will make implementing chanctx reservation
refcounting a little easier.
