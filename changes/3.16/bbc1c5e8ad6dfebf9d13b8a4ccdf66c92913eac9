drbd: fix regression 'out of mem, failed to invoke fence-peer helper'

Since linux kernel 3.13, kthread_run() internally uses
wait_for_completion_killable().  We sometimes may use kthread_run()
while we still have a signal pending, which we used to kick our threads
out of potentially blocking network functions, causing kthread_run() to
mistake that as a new fatal signal and fail.

Fix: flush_signals() before kthread_run().
