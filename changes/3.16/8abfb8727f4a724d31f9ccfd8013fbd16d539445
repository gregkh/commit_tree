tracing: Add ftrace_trace_stack into __trace_puts/__trace_bputs

Currently trace option stacktrace is not applicable for
trace_printk with constant string argument, the reason is
in __trace_puts/__trace_bputs ftrace_trace_stack is missing.

In contrast, when using trace_printk with non constant string
argument(will call into __trace_printk/__trace_bprintk), then
trace option stacktrace is workable, this inconstant result
will confuses users a lot.
