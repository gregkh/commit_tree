NFC: trf7970a: Add pm_runtime support

Add pm_runtime support by moving the code that enables the trf7970a to
the pm_runtime hook routines. The pm_runtime 'autosuspend' feature is
used so that the device isn't disabled until at least 30 seconds have
passed since trf7970a_switch_rf_off() was last called.

The result is that when trf7970a_switch_rf_on() is called, the device
will be enabled and initialized (if it isn't already).  When
trf7970a_switch_rf_off() is called, it will turn off the RF immediately
but leave the device enabled for at least 30 seconds.
If 30 seconds have passed and the pm_runtime facility decides to suspend
the driver, the device will be disabled then.
