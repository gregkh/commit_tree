KVM: nVMX: Don't advertise single context invalidation for invept

For single context invalidation, we fall through to global
invalidation in handle_invept() except for one case - when
the operand supplied by L1 is different from what we have in
vmcs12. However, typically hypervisors will only call invept
for the currently loaded eptp, so the condition will
never be true.
