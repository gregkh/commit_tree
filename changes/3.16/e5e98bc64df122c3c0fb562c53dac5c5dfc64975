xfs: remove pointless pointer increment in xfs_dir2_block_compact()

xfs_dir2_block_compact() is passed a pointer to *blp, and
advances it locally - but nobody uses the pointer (locally)
after that.

This behavior came about as part of prior refactoring,

20f7e9f xfs: factor dir2 block read operations

and looking at the code as it was before, it seems quite clear
that this change introduced a bug; the pre-refactoring code
expects blp to be modified after compaction.
And indeed it did; see this commit which fixed it:

37f1356 xfs: recalculate leaf entry pointer after compacting a dir2 block

So the bug was introduced & resolved in the 3.8 cycle.

Whoops.  Well, it's fixed now, and mystery solved; just remove
the now-pointless local increment of the blp pointer.

(I guess we should have run clang earlier!)
