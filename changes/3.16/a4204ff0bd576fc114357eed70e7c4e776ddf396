usb: cleanup setting udev->removable from port_dev->connect_type

Once usb-acpi has set the port's connect type the usb_device's
->removable attribute can be set in the standard location
set_usb_port_removable().

This also changes behavior in the case where the firmware says that the
port connect type is unknown.  In that case just use the default setting
determined from the hub descriptor.

Note, we no longer pass udev->portnum to acpi_find_child_device() in the
root hub case since:
1/ the usb-core sets this to zero
2/ acpi always expects zero
...just pass zero.
