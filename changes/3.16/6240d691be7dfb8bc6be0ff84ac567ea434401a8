pinctrl: tegra: remove fsafe from data tables

The fsafe value in the pingroup data tables is only used to implement
tegra_pinctrl_disable(). The only reason this function is called is when
dynamically switching between pinmux states, i.e. when disabling the old
state before programming the new state. It's simpler to have the new
target state define the expected value of each pin (and all current DTs
do that). This also gives more flexibility, since it allows individual
boards explicit control over the "inactive" mux function for each pin,
rather than requiring it to be an SoC-specific value. Assuming this, we
can get rid of the fsafe value from the driver completely, thus saving
some more space in the driver tables.

While re-writing the content of tegra124_pingroups[], fix the indentation
to use a TAB instead of spaces.
