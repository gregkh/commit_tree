xfs: reserve v5 superblock read-only compat. feature bit for finobt

Reserve a v5 read-only compatibility feature bit for the finobt and
create the xfs_sb_version_hasfinobt() helper to determine whether
an fs has the feature enabled.

The finobt does not change existing on-disk structures, but must
remain consistent with the ialloc btree. Modifications from older
kernels would violate that constrant. Therefore, we restrict older
kernels to read-only mounts of finobt-enabled filesystems.

Note that this does not yet enable the ability to rw mount a finobt
fs (by setting the feature bit in the XFS_SB_FEAT_RO_COMPAT_ALL
mask).
