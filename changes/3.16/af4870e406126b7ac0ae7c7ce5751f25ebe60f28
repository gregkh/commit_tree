drm/nouveau/kms/nv04-nv40: fix pageflip events via special case.

Cards with nv04 display engine can't reliably use vblank
counts and timestamps computed via drm_handle_vblank(), as
the function gets invoked after sending the pageflip events.

Fix this by defaulting to the old crtcid = -1 fallback path
on <= NV-50 cards, and only using the precise path on NV-50
and later.
