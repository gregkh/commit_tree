ath10k: prevent hif_stop being called twice

Recently there was a bug discovered that involved
hif_stop() being called twice that ended up with a
double free_irq() call but it only manifested with
multiple MSI interrupts mapping.

Catch this kind of a problem early in driver
regardless of interrupt mapping.
