mm: fold mlocked_vma_newpage() into its only call site

In previous commit(mm: use the light version __mod_zone_page_state in
mlocked_vma_newpage()) a irq-unsafe __mod_zone_page_state is used.  And as
suggested by Andrew, to reduce the risks that new call sites incorrectly
using mlocked_vma_newpage() without knowing they are adding racing, this
patch folds mlocked_vma_newpage() into its only call site,
page_add_new_anon_rmap, to make it open-cocded for people to know what is
going on.
