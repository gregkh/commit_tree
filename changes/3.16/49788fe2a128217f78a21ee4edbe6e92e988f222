arm64/crypto: AES-ECB/CBC/CTR/XTS using ARMv8 NEON and Crypto Extensions

This adds ARMv8 implementations of AES in ECB, CBC, CTR and XTS modes,
both for ARMv8 with Crypto Extensions and for plain ARMv8 NEON.

The Crypto Extensions version can only run on ARMv8 implementations that
have support for these optional extensions.

The plain NEON version is a table based yet time invariant implementation.
All S-box substitutions are performed in parallel, leveraging the wide range
of ARMv8's tbl/tbx instructions, and the huge NEON register file, which can
comfortably hold the entire S-box and still have room to spare for doing the
actual computations.

The key expansion routines were borrowed from aes_generic.
