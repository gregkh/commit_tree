drm/i915: fix freeze with blank screen booting highmem

x86_64 boots and displays fine, but booting x86_32 with CONFIG_HIGHMEM
has frozen with a blank screen throughout 3.16-rc on this ThinkPad T420s,
with i915 generation 6 graphics.

Fix 9d0a6fa6c5e6 ("drm/i915: add render state initialization"): kunmap()
takes struct page * argument, not virtual address.  Which the compiler
kindly points out, if you use the appropriate u32 *batch, instead of
silencing it with a void *.

Why did bisection lead decisively to nearby 229b0489aa75 ("drm/i915:
add null render states for gen6, gen7 and gen8")?  Because the u32
deposited at that virtual address by the previous stub failed the
PageHighMem test, and so did no harm.
