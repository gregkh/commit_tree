epoll: fix use-after-free in eventpoll_release_file

This fixes use-after-free of epi->fllink.next inside list loop macro.
This loop actually releases elements in the body.  The list is
rcu-protected but here we cannot hold rcu_read_lock because we need to
lock mutex inside.

The obvious solution is to use list_for_each_entry_safe().  RCU-ness
isn't essential because nobody can change this list under us, it's final
fput for this file.

The bug was introduced by ae10b2b4eb01 ("epoll: optimize EPOLL_CTL_DEL
using rcu")
