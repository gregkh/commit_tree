ARM: EXYNOS: Move the power sequence call in the cpu_pm notifier

The code to initiate and exit the powerdown sequence is the same in
pm.c and cpuidle.c.

Let's split the common part in the pm.c and reuse it from the cpu_pm notifier.

That is one more step forward to make the cpuidle driver arch indenpendant.
