[media] v4l: ti-vpe: Fix some params in VPE data descriptors

Some parameters of the VPE descriptors were understood incorrectly. They are now
fixed. The fixes are explained as follows:

- When adding an inbound data descriptor to the VPDMA descriptor list, we intend
  to use c_rect as the cropped region fetched by VPDMA. Therefore, c_rect->width
  shouldn't be used to calculate the line stride, the original image width
  should be used for that. We add a 'width' argument which gives the buffer
  width in memory.

- frame_width and frame_height describe the complete width and height of the
  client to which the channel is connected. If there are multiple channels
  fetching data and providing to the same client, the above 2 arguments should
  be the width and height of the region covered by all the channels. In the case
  where there is only one channel providing pixel data to the client
  (like in VPE), frame_width and frame_height should be the cropped width and
  cropped height respectively. The calculation of these params is done in the
  vpe driver now.

- start_h and start_v is also used in the case of multiple channels to describe
  where each channel should start filling pixel data. We don't use this in VPE,
  and pass 0s to the vpdma_add_in_dtd() helper.

- Some minor changes are made to the vpdma_add_out_dtd() helper. The c_rect
  param is used for specifying the 'composition' target, and 'width'  is added
  to calculate the line stride.
