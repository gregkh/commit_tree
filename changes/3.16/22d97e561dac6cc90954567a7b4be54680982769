[media] adv7604: Replace *_and_or() functions with *_clr_set()

The *_and_or() functions take an 'and' bitmask to be ANDed with the
register value before ORing it with th 'or' bitmask. As the functions
are used to mask and set bits selectively, this requires the caller to
invert the 'and' bitmask and is thus error prone. Replace those
functions with a *_clr_set() variant that takes a mask of bits to be
cleared instead of a mask of bits to be kept.
