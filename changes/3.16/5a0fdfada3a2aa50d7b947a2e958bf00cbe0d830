Revert "arm64: Introduce execute-only page access permissions"

This reverts commit bc07c2c6e9ed125d362af0214b6313dca180cb08.

While the aim is increased security for --x memory maps, it does not
protect against kernel level reads. Until SECCOMP is implemented for
arm64, revert this patch to avoid giving a false idea of execute-only
mappings.
