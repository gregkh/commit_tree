staging: comedi: remove check for CONFIG_KMOD

The comedi driver was added in v2.6.29. That's the same release that
removed the Kconfig symbol KMOD. So the code behind a test for its
macro has been hidden since it was in staging. Remove it.

Remove a useless assignment to "dev->in_request_module" too. That
variable seems pointless anyhow, but that's a different issue.
