ocfs2: do not return DLM_MIGRATE_RESPONSE_MASTERY_REF to avoid endless,loop during umount

The following case may lead to endless loop during umount.

node A         node B               node C       node D
umount volume,
migrate lockres1
to B
                                                 want to lock lockres1,
                                                 send
                                                 MASTER_REQUEST_MSG
                                                 to C
                                    init block mle
               send
               MIGRATE_REQUEST_MSG
               to C
                                    find a block
                                    mle, and then
                                    return
                                    DLM_MIGRATE_RESPONSE_MASTERY_REF
                                    to B
               set C in refmap
                                    umount successfully
               try to umount, endless
               loop occurs when migrate
               lockres1 since C is in
               refmap

So we can fix this endless loop case by only returning
DLM_MIGRATE_RESPONSE_MASTERY_REF if it has a mastery mle when receiving
MIGRATE_REQUEST_MSG.
