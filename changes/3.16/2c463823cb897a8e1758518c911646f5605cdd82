Btrfs: avoid visiting all extent items when cloning a range

When cloning a range of a file, we were visiting all the extent items in
the btree that belong to our source inode. We don't need to visit those
extent items that don't overlap the range we are cloning, as doing so only
makes us waste time and do unnecessary btree navigations (btrfs_next_leaf)
for inodes that have a large number of file extent items in the btree.
