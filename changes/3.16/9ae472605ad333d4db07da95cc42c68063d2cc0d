drbd: fix stalled resync detection in /proc/drbd

If we don't make resync or verify progress for "too long",
we want to flag it as "stalled".

Since 2010, "use rolling marks for resync speed calculation"
this "too long" was wrong by a factor of HZ.
With HZ 250, it would have been flagged as stalled
after 100 minutes.

Hardcode 3 minutes instead.
