nfs: page group syncing in write path

Operations that modify state for a whole page must be syncronized across
all requests within a page group. In the write path, this is calling
end_page_writeback and removing the head request from an inode.
Both of these operations should not be called until all requests
in a page group have reached the point where they would call them.

This patch should have no effect yet since all page groups currently
have one request, but will come into play when pg_test functions are
modified to split pages into sub-page regions.
