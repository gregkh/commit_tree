evm: replace HMAC version with attribute mask

Using HMAC version limits the posibility to arbitrarily add new
attributes such as SMACK64EXEC to the hmac calculation.

This patch replaces hmac version with attribute mask.
Desired attributes can be enabled with configuration parameter.
It allows to build kernels which works with previously labeled
filesystems.

Currently supported attribute is 'fsuuid' which is equivalent of
the former version 2.
