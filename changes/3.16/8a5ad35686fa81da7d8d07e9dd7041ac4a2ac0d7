powerpc/eeh: Cleanup EEH subsystem variables

There're 2 EEH subsystem variables: eeh_subsystem_enabled and
eeh_probe_mode. We needn't maintain 2 variables and we can just
have one variable and introduce different flags. The patch also
introduces additional flag EEH_FORCE_DISABLE, which will be used
to disable EEH subsystem via boot parameter ("eeh=off") in future.
Besides, the patch also introduces flag EEH_ENABLED, which is
changed to disable or enable EEH functionality on the fly through
debugfs entry in future.

With the patch applied, the creteria to check the enabled EEH
functionality is changed to:

!EEH_FORCE_DISABLED && EEH_ENABLED : Enabled
                       Other cases : Disabled
