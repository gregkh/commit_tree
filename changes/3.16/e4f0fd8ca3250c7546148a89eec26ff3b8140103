drm/exynos: Fix double locks at PM resume

The recent commit [3ea87855: drm/helper: lock all around force mode
restore] introduced drm_modeset_lock_all() in
drm_helper_resume_force_mode() itself, while exynos driver takes this
lock before calling it.  Move the function call outside the lock for
avoiding a deadlock.
