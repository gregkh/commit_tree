kvm/x86: implement hv EOI assist

It seems that it's easy to implement the EOI assist
on top of the PV EOI feature: simply convert the
page address to the format expected by PV EOI.

Notes:
-"No EOI required" is set only if interrupt injected
 is edge triggered; this is true because level interrupts are going
 through IOAPIC which disables PV EOI.
 In any case, if guest triggers EOI the bit will get cleared on exit.
-For migration, set of HV_X64_MSR_APIC_ASSIST_PAGE sets
 KVM_PV_EOI_EN internally, so restoring HV_X64_MSR_APIC_ASSIST_PAGE
 seems sufficient
 In any case, bit is cleared on exit so worst case it's never re-enabled
-no handling of PV EOI data is performed at HV_X64_MSR_EOI write;
 HV_X64_MSR_EOI is a separate optimization - it's an X2APIC
 replacement that lets you do EOI with an MSR and not IO.
