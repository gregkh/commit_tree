net: phy: Ensure the MDIO bus module is held

This commit adds proper module_{get,put} to prevent the MDIO bus module
from being unloaded while the phydev is connected. By doing so, we fix
a kernel panic produced when a MDIO driver is removed, but the phydev
that relies on it is attached and running.
