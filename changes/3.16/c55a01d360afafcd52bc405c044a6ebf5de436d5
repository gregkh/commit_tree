fuse: avoid scheduling while atomic

As reported by Richard Sharpe, an attempt to use fuse_notify_inval_entry()
triggers complains about scheduling while atomic:

  BUG: scheduling while atomic: fuse.hf/13976/0x10000001

This happens because fuse_notify_inval_entry() attempts to allocate memory
with GFP_KERNEL, holding "struct fuse_copy_state" mapped by kmap_atomic().

Introduced by commit 58bda1da4b3c "fuse/dev: use atomic maps"

Fix by moving the map/unmap to just cover the actual memcpy operation.
