[media] v4l: Only get module if it's different than the driver for v4l2_dev

When the sub-device is registered, increment the use count of the sub-device
owner only if it's different from the owner of the driver for the media
device. This avoids increasing the use count by the module itself and thus
making it possible to unload it when it's not in use.
