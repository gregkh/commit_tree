cnic: Don't take rcu_read_lock in cnic_rcv_netevent()

Because the called function, such as bnx2fc_indicate_netevent(), can sleep,
we cannot take rcu_lock().  To prevent the rcu protected ulp_ops from going
away, we use the cnic_lock mutex and set the ULP_F_CALL_PENDING flag.
The code already waits for ULP_F_CALL_PENDING flag to clear in
cnic_unregister_device().
