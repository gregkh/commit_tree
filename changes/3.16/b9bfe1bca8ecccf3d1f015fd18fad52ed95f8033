PCI: rcar: Use new OF interrupt mapping when possible

Use new OF interrupt mapping (of_irq_parse_and_map_pci()) when possible.
This is the recommended method of doing the IRQ mapping.  For old
devicetrees we fall back to the previous practice.

This allows interrupts to be remapped across bridges.
