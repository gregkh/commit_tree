uprobes/x86: Cleanup the usage of UPROBE_FIX_IP/UPROBE_FIX_CALL

Now that UPROBE_FIX_IP/UPROBE_FIX_CALL are mutually exclusive we can
use a single "fix_ip_or_call" enum instead of 2 fix_* booleans. This
way the logic looks more understandable and clean to me.

While at it, join "case 0xea" with other "ip is correct" ret/lret cases.
Also change default_post_xol_op() to use "else if" for the same reason.
