tracing: Have saved_cmdlines use the seq_read infrastructure

Current tracing_saved_cmdlines_read() implementation is naive; It allocates
a large buffer, constructs output data to that buffer for each read
operation, and then copies a portion of the buffer to the user space
buffer. This has several issues such as slow memory allocation, high
CPU usage, and even corruption of the output data.

The seq_read infrastructure is made to handle this type of work.
By converting it to use seq_read() the code becomes smaller, simplified,
as well as correct.
