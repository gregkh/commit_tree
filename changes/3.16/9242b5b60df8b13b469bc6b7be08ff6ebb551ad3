KVM: x86: Check for nested events if there is an injectable interrupt

With commit b6b8a1451fc40412c57d1 that introduced
vmx_check_nested_events, checks for injectable interrupts happen
at different points in time for L1 and L2 that could potentially
cause a race. The regression occurs because KVM_REQ_EVENT is always
set when nested_run_pending is set even if there's no pending interrupt.
Consequently, there could be a small window when check_nested_events
returns without exiting to L1, but an interrupt comes through soon
after and it incorrectly, gets injected to L2 by inject_pending_event
Fix this by adding a call to check for nested events too when a check
for injectable interrupt returns true
