tracing: Add __field_struct macro for TRACE_EVENT()

Currently the __field() macro in TRACE_EVENT is only good for primitive
values, such as integers and pointers, but it fails on complex data types
such as structures or unions. This is because the __field() macro
determines if the variable is signed or not with the test of:

  (((type)(-1)) < (type)1)

Unfortunately, that fails when type is a structure.

Since trace events should support structures as fields a new macro
is created for such a case called __field_struct() which acts exactly
the same as __field() does but it does not do the signed type check
and just uses a constant false for that answer.
