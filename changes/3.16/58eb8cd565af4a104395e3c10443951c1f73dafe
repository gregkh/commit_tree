ata: use CONFIG_PM_SLEEP instead of CONFIG_PM where applicable in host drivers

This patch fixes host drivers to use CONFIG_PM_SLEEP instead of CONFIG_PM
where applicable.  Benefits of this change:

* unused code is not being compiled in for CONFIG_PM=y, CONFIG_PM_SLEEP=n
  and CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y configurations

* easier transition to use struct dev_pm_ops and SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() in
  the future

* more consistent code (there are host drivers which are using the correct
  CONFIG_PM_SLEEP checks already)

The patch leaves the core libata code and ->port_[suspend,resume] support
in sata_[inic162x,nv,sil24].c alone for now.
