net: Fix save software checksum complete

Geert reported issues regarding checksum complete and UDP.
The logic introduced in commit 7e3cead5172927732f51fde
("net: Save software checksum complete") is not correct.

This patch:
1) Restores code in __skb_checksum_complete_header except for setting
   CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY. This function may be calculating checksum on
   something less than skb->len.
2) Adds saving checksum to __skb_checksum_complete. The full packet
   checksum 0..skb->len is calculated without adding in pseudo header.
   This value is saved in skb->csum and then the pseudo header is added
   to that to derive the checksum for validation.
3) In both __skb_checksum_complete_header and __skb_checksum_complete,
   set skb->csum_valid to whether checksum of zero was computed. This
   allows skb_csum_unnecessary to return true without changing to
   CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY which was done previously.
4) Copy new csum related bits in __copy_skb_header.
