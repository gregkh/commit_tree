x86-32, vdso: Fix vDSO build error due to missing align_vdso_addr()

Relying on static functions used just once to get inlined (and
subsequently have dead code paths eliminated) is wrong: Compilers are
free to decide whether they do this, regardless of optimization level.
With this not happening for vdso_addr() (observed with gcc 4.1.x), an
unresolved reference to align_vdso_addr() causes the build to fail.

[ hpa: vdso_addr() is never actually used on x86-32, as calculate_addr
  in map_vdso() is always false.  It ought to be possible to clean
  this up further, but this fixes the immediate problem. ]
