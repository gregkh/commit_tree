pwm: lpss: Fix const qualifier and sparse warnings

Fixes the following warnings reported by the 0-DAY kernel build testing
backend:

   drivers/pwm/pwm-lpss.c: In function 'pwm_lpss_probe_pci':
>> drivers/pwm/pwm-lpss.c:192:2: warning: passing argument 3 of 'pwm_lpss_probe' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [enabled by default]
     lpwm = pwm_lpss_probe(&pdev->dev, &pdev->resource[0], info);
     ^
