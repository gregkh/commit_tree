ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: re-enable SDHCI drivers

Following 5d01b7684b7e "mmc: simplify SDHCI Kconfig dependencies",
SDHCI drivers that use MMC_SDHCI_PLTFM no longer select it, but
instead depend on it. This means that multi_v7_defconfig no longer
selects it, and hence many SDHCI drivers are no longer enabled.
Explicitly enable MMC_SDHCI_PLTFM to solve this.
