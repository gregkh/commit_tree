DMA-API: Clarify physical/bus address distinction

The DMA-API documentation sometimes refers to "physical addresses" when it
really means "bus addresses."  Sometimes these are identical, but they may
be different if the bridge leading to the bus performs address translation.
Update the documentation to use "bus address" when appropriate.

Also, consistently capitalize "DMA", use parens with function names, use
dev_printk() in examples, and reword a few sections for clarity.

No functional change; documentation changes only.
