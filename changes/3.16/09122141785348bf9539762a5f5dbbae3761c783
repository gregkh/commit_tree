usb: gadget: f_fs: resurect usb_functionfs_descs_head structure

Even though usb_functionfs_descs_head structure is now deprecated,
it has been used by some user space tools.  Its removel in commit
[ac8dde1: “Add flags to descriptors block”] was an oversight
leading to build breakage for such tools.

Bring it back so that old user space tools can still be build
without problems on newer kernel versions.
