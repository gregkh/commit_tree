lz4: add overrun checks to lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize()

Jan points out that I forgot to make the needed fixes to the
lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize() function to mirror the changes done
in lz4_decompress() with regards to potential pointer overflows.

The only in-kernel user of this function is the zram code, which only
takes data from a valid compressed buffer that it made itself, so it's
not a big issue.  But due to external kernel modules using this
function, it's better to be safe here.
