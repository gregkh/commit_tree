perf report: Count number of entries separately

The hists->nr_entries is counted in multiple places so that they can
confuse readers of the code.  This is a preparation of later change
and do not intend any functional difference.

Note that report__collapse_hists() now changed to return nothing since
its return value (nr_samples) is only for checking if there's any data
in the input file and this can be acheived by checking ->nr_entries.
