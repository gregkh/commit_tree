usb: catch attempts to submit urbs with a vmalloc'd transfer buffer

Save someone else the debug cycles of figuring out why a driver's
transfer request is failing or causing undefined system behavior.
Buffers submitted for dma must come from GFP allocated / DMA-able
memory.

Return -EAGAIN matching the return value for dma_mapping_error() cases.
