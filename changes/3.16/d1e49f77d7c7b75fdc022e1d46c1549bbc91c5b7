mmc: sdhci: convert ADMA descriptors to a coherent allocation

Rather than using the streaming API, use the coherent allocator to
provide this memory, thereby eliminating cache flushing of it each
time we map and unmap it.  This results in a 7.5% increase in
transfer speed with a UHS-1 card operating in 3.3v mode at a clock
of 49.5MHz.
