watchdog: orion: Add Armada 375/380 SoC support

This commit adds support for the Armada 375 and Armada 380 SoCs.

This SoC variant has a second RSTOUT register, in addition to the already
existent, which is shared with the system-controller. To handle this RSTOUT,
we introduce a new MMIO register 'rstout_mask' to be required on
'armada-{375,380}-watchdog' new compatible string.
