ftrace: Remove boolean of hash_enable and hash_disable

Commit 4104d326b670 "ftrace: Remove global function list and call
function directly" cleaned up the global_ops filtering and made
the code simpler, but it left a variable "hash_enable" that was used
to know if the hash functions should be updated or not. It was
updated if the global_ops did not override them. As the global_ops
are now no different than any other ftrace_ops, the hash always
gets updated and there's no reason to use the hash_enable boolean.

The same goes for hash_disable used in ftrace_shutdown().
