cgroup: make css_next_child() skip missing csses

css_next_child() walks the children of the specified css.  It does
this by finding the next cgroup and then returning the requested css.
On the default unified hierarchy, a cgroup may not have a css
associated with it even if the hierarchy has the subsystem enabled.
This patch updates css_next_child() so that it skips children without
the requested css associated.
