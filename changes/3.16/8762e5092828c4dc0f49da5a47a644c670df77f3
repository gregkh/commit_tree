x86/espfix/xen: Fix allocation of pages for paravirt page tables

init_espfix_ap() is currently off by one level when informing hypervisor
that allocated pages will be used for ministacks' page tables.

The most immediate effect of this on a PV guest is that if
'stack_page = __get_free_page()' returns a non-zeroed-out page the hypervisor
will refuse to use it for a page table (which it shouldn't be anyway). This will
result in warnings by both Xen and Linux.

More importantly, a subsequent write to that page (again, by a PV guest) is
likely to result in fatal page fault.
