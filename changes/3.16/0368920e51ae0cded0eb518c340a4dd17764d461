drm/i915: Disable FBC by default also on Haswell and later

It causes black screen on bootup and is approximately 100x slower than
running with FBC disabled, so the GPU runs at a high frequency for much
longer - completely contrary to the power saving claims. It also still
has mutex deadlocks in multi-head scenarios, which can lead to a
system/X lockup. These bugs were known before FBC was enabled by default
on Haswell and still have not been fixed.
