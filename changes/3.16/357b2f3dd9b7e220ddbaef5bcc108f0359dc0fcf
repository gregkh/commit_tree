powerpc/eeh: Dump PE location code

As Ben suggested, it's meaningful to dump PE's location code
for site engineers when hitting EEH errors. The patch introduces
function eeh_pe_loc_get() to retireve the location code from
dev-tree so that we can output it when hitting EEH errors.

If primary PE bus is root bus, the PHB's dev-node would be tried
prior to root port's dev-node. Otherwise, the upstream bridge's
dev-node of the primary PE bus will be check for the location code
directly.
