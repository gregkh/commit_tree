drm/i915: Parse EDID probed modes for DRRS support

This patch and finds out the lowest refresh rate supported for the resolution
same as the fixed_mode.
It also checks the VBT fields to see if panel supports seamless DRRS or not.
Based on above data it marks whether eDP panel supports seamless DRRS or not.
This information is needed for supporting seamless DRRS switch for certain
power saving usecases. This patch is tested by enabling the DRM logs and
user should see whether Seamless DRRS is supported or not.
