FDDI: Reformat <linux/if_fddi.h> for 8-character tabs

Some of our FDDI support code has been apparently written with an
assumption that tabs are 4-character wide.  In preparation to the next
change this update reformats <linux/if_fddi.h> so that it stays within 79
columns and otherwise renders correctly with 8-character tabs.  No
functional change.
