brcmfmac: reduce log level for invalid scheduled scan request

When a regular scan does not return any networks user-space does
request a scheduled scan without any matchset or ssid. This can
not be handled by the firmware so we return -EINVAL. However, as
this request is done let us not add an error message to the log.
