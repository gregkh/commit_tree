arm64: ftrace: Add system call tracepoint

This patch allows system call entry or exit to be traced as ftrace events,
ie. sys_enter_*/sys_exit_*, if CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS is enabled.
Those events appear and can be controlled under
    ${sysfs}/tracing/events/syscalls/

Please note that we can't trace compat system calls here because
AArch32 mode does not share the same syscall table with AArch64.
Just define ARCH_TRACE_IGNORE_COMPAT_SYSCALLS in order to avoid unexpected
results (bogus syscalls reported or even hang-up).
