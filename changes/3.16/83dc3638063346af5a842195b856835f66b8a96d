rtlwifi: remove unused allow_all_destaddr functions

Unused as configure_filter takes care of setting/clearing RCR_AAP.

In commit "rtlwifi: rtl8723be: rtl8723com: Remove unused
allow_all_destaddr functions", Larry Finger removed allow_all_destaddr
from the struct. This commit removes the related function too.
