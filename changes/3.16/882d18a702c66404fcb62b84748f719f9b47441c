ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Add hotplug contexts to PCI host bridges

After relatively recent changes in the ACPI-based PCI hotplug
(ACPIPHP) code, the acpiphp_check_host_bridge() executed for PCI
host bridges via acpi_pci_root_scan_dependent() doesn't do anything
useful, because those bridges do not have hotplug contexts.  That
happens by mistake, so fix it by making acpiphp_enumerate_slots()
add hotplug contexts to PCI host bridges too and modify
acpiphp_remove_slots() to drop those contexts for host bridges
as appropriate.
