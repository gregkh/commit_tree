[media] vb2: stop_streaming should return void

The vb2 core ignores any return code from the stop_streaming op.
And there really isn't anything it can do anyway in case of an error.
So change the return type to void and update any drivers that implement it.

The int return gave drivers the idea that this operation could actually
fail, but that's really not the case.

The pwc amd sdr-msi3101 drivers both had this construction:

        if (mutex_lock_interruptible(&s->v4l2_lock))
                return -ERESTARTSYS;

This has been updated to just call mutex_lock(). The stop_streaming op
expects this to really stop streaming and I very much doubt this will
work reliably if stop_streaming just returns without really stopping the
DMA.
