memory: mvebu-devbus: use ARMADA_ prefix in defines

The mvebu-devbus driver currently only supports the Armada 370/XP
family, but it can also cover the Orion5x family. However, the Orion5x
family has a different organization of the register. Therefore, in
preparation to the introduction of Orion5x support, we rename the
Armada 370/XP specific definitions to have an ARMADA_ prefix.
