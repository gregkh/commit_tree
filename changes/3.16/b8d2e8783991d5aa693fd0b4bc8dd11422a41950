brcmfmac: Fix reconnect failure after beacon timeout

The DISASSOC command needs to be sent to firmware when a connection
loss is detected by firmware (e.g., beacon timeout). Otherwise the
next connect request fails due to a lingering LINK(down) event from
firmware. This patch resolves the issue by using brcmf_link_down()
handler, instead of the incomplete duplicated codes.
