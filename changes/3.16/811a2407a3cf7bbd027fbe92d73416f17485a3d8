ARM: 8115/1: LPAE: reduce damage caused by idmap to virtual memory layout

On LPAE, each level 1 (pgd) page table entry maps 1GiB, and the level 2
(pmd) entries map 2MiB.

When the identity mapping is created on LPAE, the pgd pointers are copied
from the swapper_pg_dir.  If we find that we need to modify the contents
of a pmd, we allocate a new empty pmd table and insert it into the
appropriate 1GB slot, before then filling it with the identity mapping.

However, if the 1GB slot covers the kernel lowmem mappings, we obliterate
those mappings.

When replacing a PMD, first copy the old PMD contents to the new PMD, so
that we preserve the existing mappings, particularly the mappings of the
kernel itself.
