i40e: Do not accept tagged packets by default

Remove the filter created by the firmware with the default MAC address it
reads out of the NVM storage and a promiscuous VLAN tag and replace it
with a filter that will not accept tagged packets by default.  The system
must request a VLAN tag packet filter to get packets with that tag.
