blk-mq: push IPI or local end_io decision to __blk_mq_complete_request()

We have callers outside of the blk-mq proper (like timeouts) that
want to call __blk_mq_complete_request(), so rename the function
and put the decision code for whether to use ->softirq_done_fn
or blk_mq_endio() into __blk_mq_complete_request().

This also makes the interface more logical again.
blk_mq_complete_request() attempts to atomically mark the request
completed, and calls __blk_mq_complete_request() if successful.
__blk_mq_complete_request() then just ends the request.
