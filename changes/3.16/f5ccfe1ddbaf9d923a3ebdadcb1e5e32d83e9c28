ext4: fix locking for O_APPEND writes

Al Viro pointed out that locking for O_APPEND writes was problematic,
since the location of the write isn't known until after we take the
i_mutex, which impacts the ext4_unaligned_aio() and s_bitmap_maxbytes
check.

For O_APPEND always assume that the write is unaligned so call
ext4_unwritten_wait().  And to solve the second problem, take the
i_mutex earlier before we start the s_bitmap_maxbytes check.
