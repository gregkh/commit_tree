iommu/exynos: Gating clocks of master H/W

This patch gates clocks of master H/W as well as clocks of System MMU
if master clocks are specified.

Some Exynos SoCs (i.e. GScalers in Exynos5250) have dependencies in
the gating clocks of master H/W and its System MMU. If a H/W is the
case, accessing control registers of System MMU is prohibited unless
both of the gating clocks of System MMU and its master H/W.
