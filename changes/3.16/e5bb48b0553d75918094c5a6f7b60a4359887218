MIPS: bpf: Drop update_on_xread and always initialize the X register

Previously, update_on_xread() only set the reset flag if SEEN_X hasn't
been set already. However, SEEN_X is used to indicate that X is used
as destination or source register so there are some cases where X
is only used as source register and we really need to make sure that it
has been initialized in time. As a result of which, drop this function and
always set X to zero if it's used in any of the opcodes.
