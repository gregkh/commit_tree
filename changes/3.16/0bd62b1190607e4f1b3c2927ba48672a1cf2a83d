slab: delete cache from list after __kmem_cache_shutdown succeeds

Currently, on kmem_cache_destroy we delete the cache from the slab_list
before __kmem_cache_shutdown, inserting it back to the list on failure.
Initially, this was done, because we could release the slab_mutex in
__kmem_cache_shutdown to delete sysfs slub entry, but since commit
41a212859a4d ("slub: use sysfs'es release mechanism for kmem_cache") we
remove sysfs entry later in kmem_cache_destroy after dropping the
slab_mutex, so that no implementation of __kmem_cache_shutdown can ever
release the lock.  Therefore we can simplify the code a bit by moving
list_del after __kmem_cache_shutdown.
