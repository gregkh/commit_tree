kernel/workqueue.c: pr_warning/pr_warn & printk/pr_info

This commit did an incorrect printk->pr_info conversion. If we were
converting to pr_info() we should lose the log_level parameter. The problem is
that this is called (indirectly) by show_regs_print_info(), which is called
with various log_levels (from _INFO clear to _EMERG). So we leave it as
a printk() call so the desired log_level is applied.

Not a full revert, as the other half of the patch is correct.
