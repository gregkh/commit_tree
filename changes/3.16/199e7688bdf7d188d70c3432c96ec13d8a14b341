ASoC: rsnd: care DMA slave channel name for DT

Renesas sound driver is supporting to use DMAEngine.
But, DMA slave channel name "tx", "rx" is not enough
in DT case.
Becuase, it has many ports and path combination.

This patch adds rsnd_dma_of_name() to find
DMA channel name, for example
memory to SSI0 is "mem_ssi0",
SSI0 to memory is "ssi0_mem",
SSI0 to SRC0   is "ssi0_src0",
SRC0 to SSI0   is "src0_ssi0",
SRC0 to DVC0   is "src0_dvc0"...

Renesas sound want to use PIO transfer mode for some reasons.
It will be PIO tranfer mode if device node doesn't have
DMA settings.
