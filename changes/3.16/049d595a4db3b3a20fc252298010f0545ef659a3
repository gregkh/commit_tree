PM / OPP: Make OPP invisible to users in Kconfig

The OPP code is an in kernel library selected by its users, there is no
no architecture code required to implement it and enabling it without a
user just increases the kernel size. Since the users select rather than
depend on it just remove the ability to directly set the option from
Kconfig.
