spi: rspi: Round up division to avoid slave overclocking

The calculation of the bit rate divider used a standard C division, which
rounds down the quotient. This may lead to a higher bitrate than requested.
Round up to avoid this.

E.g. on Koelsch, the SPI flash (configured for 30 MHz) was driven at 48.75
MHz. After this patch it's driven at a safe 24.375 MHz.
