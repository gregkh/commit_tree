xen-netback: Move grant_copy_op array back into struct xenvif.

This array was allocated separately in commit ac3d5ac2 ("xen-netback:
fix guest-receive-side array sizes") due to it being very large, and a
struct xenvif is allocated as the netdev_priv part of a struct
net_device, i.e. via kmalloc() but falling back to vmalloc() if the
initial alloc. fails.

In preparation for the multi-queue patches, where this array becomes
part of struct xenvif_queue and is always allocated through vzalloc(),
move this back into the struct xenvif.
