bus: omap_l3_noc: Add AM4372 interconnect error data

Add AM4372 information to handle L3 error.

AM4372 has two clk domains 100f and 200s. Provide flagmux and data
associated with it.

NOTE: Timeout doesn't have STDERRLOG_MAIN register. And per hardware
team, L3 timeout error cannot be cleared the normal way (by setting
bit 31 in STDERRLOG_MAIN), instead it may be required to do system
reset. L3 error handler can't help in such scenarios.

Hence indicate timeout target offset as L3_TARGET_NOT_SUPPORTED as
done for undocumented bits.
