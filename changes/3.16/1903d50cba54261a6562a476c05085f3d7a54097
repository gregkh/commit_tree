perf: Revert ("perf: Always destroy groups on exit")

Vince reported that commit 15a2d4de0eab5 ("perf: Always destroy groups
on exit") causes a regression with grouped events. In particular his
read_group_attached.c test fails.

  https://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests/blob/master/tests/bugs/read_group_attached.c

Because of the context switch optimization in
perf_event_context_sched_out() the 'original' event may end up in the
child process and when that exits the change in the patch in question
destroys the actual grouping.

Therefore revert that change and only destroy inherited groups.
