be2iscsi: Fix exposing Host in sysfs after adapter initialization is complete

 Before probe for function was completed, iSCSI Daemon had initiated login
 to target while OS was coming up. The targets which had node.startup=automatic,
 login process was initiated.Since function specific initialization was still in
 progress this lead to kernel panic.

 Fixed the issue by moving iscsi_host_add() call after adapter initialization
 is done.
