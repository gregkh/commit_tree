ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Rename VSP1_(SY|RT) clocks to VSP1_(S|R)

The r8a7790 has four VSP1 instances, two of them being named VSPS (which
stands for "VSP Standard") and VSPR (which stands for "VSP for
Resizing"). The clock section in the SoC datasheet misunderstood the
abbreviations as meaning VSP System and VSP Realtime, and named the
corresponding clocks VSP1(SY) and VSP1(RT). This mistake has been
carried over to the kernel code.

Fix this by renaming the VSP1_SY and VSP1_RT clocks to VSP1_S and VSP1_R.
