ARM: l2c: add platform independent core L2 cache OF initialisation

Add a hook into the core ARM code to perform L2 cache initialisation
in a platform independent manner.  Platforms still get to indicate
their auxiliary control register values and mask, but the
initialisation call will now be made from generic code.
