perf: Do not allow optimized switch for non-cloned events

The context check in perf_event_context_sched_out allows
non-cloned context to be part of the optimized schedule
out switch.

This could move non-cloned context into another workload
child. Once this child exits, the context is closed and
leaves all original (parent) events in closed state.

Any other new cloned event will have closed state and not
measure anything. And probably causing other odd bugs.
