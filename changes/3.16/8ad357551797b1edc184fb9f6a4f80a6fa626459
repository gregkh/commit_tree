KVM: s390: enable IBS for single running VCPUs

This patch enables the IBS facility when a single VCPU is running.
The facility is dynamically turned on/off as soon as other VCPUs
enter/leave the stopped state.

When this facility is operating, some instructions can be executed
faster for single-cpu guests.
