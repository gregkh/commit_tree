sparc: drop use of extern for prototypes in arch/sparc/include/asm

Drop extern for all prototypes and adjust alignment of parameters
as required after the removal.
In a few rare cases adjust linelength to conform to maximum 80 chars,
and likewise in a few rare cases adjust alignment of parameters
to static functions.
