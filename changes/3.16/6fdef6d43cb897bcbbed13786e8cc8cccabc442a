Btrfs: don't release invalid page in btrfs_page_exists_in_range()

In inode.c:btrfs_page_exists_in_range(), if the page we got from
the radix tree is an exception entry, which can't be retried, we
exit the loop with a non-NULL page and then call page_cache_release
against it, which is not ok since it's not a valid page. This could
also make us return true when we shouldn't.
