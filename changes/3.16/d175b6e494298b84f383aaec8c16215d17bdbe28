ARM: mvebu: add Device Tree description of AHCI interfaces on Armada 38x

The Marvell Armada 38x processors contain two AHCI compatible
interfaces. This commit adds the Device Tree description of those
interfaces at the SoC level, and also enables them on the Armada 385
DB platform, which allows access to both interfaces through SATA
ports.
