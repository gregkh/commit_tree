powerpc: Add threads_per_subcore

On POWER8 we have a new concept of a subcore. This is what happens when
you take a regular core and split it. A subcore is a grouping of two or
four SMT threads, as well as a handfull of SPRs which allows the subcore
to appear as if it were a core from the point of view of a guest.

Unlike threads_per_core which is fixed at boot, threads_per_subcore can
change while the system is running. Most code will not want to use
threads_per_subcore.
