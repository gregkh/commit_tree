virtio-rng: fixes for device registration/unregistration

There are several fixes in this patch (mostly because it's hard
splitting them up):

 - Revert the name field in struct hwrng back to 'const'. Also, don't
do an extra kmalloc for the name - just wasteful.
 - Deal with allocation failures properly.
 - Use IDA to allocate device number instead of brute forcing one.
