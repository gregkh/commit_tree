Input: atmel_mxt_ts - wait for CHG assert in mxt_check_bootloader

The driver should not immediately read bootloader status when in
Application Update Mode. The CHG line will assert when the device has made
a state transition and is ready to report a new status via i2c.

This change adds a wait for completion in mxt_check_bootloader, and changes
the mxt_interrupt handler to signal the completion.
