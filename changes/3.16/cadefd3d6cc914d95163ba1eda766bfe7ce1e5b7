sched: Make scale_rt_power() deal with backward clocks

Mike reported that, while unlikely, its entirely possible for
scale_rt_power() to see the time go backwards. This yields rather
'interesting' results.

So like all other sites that deal with clocks; make this one ignore
backward clock movement too.
