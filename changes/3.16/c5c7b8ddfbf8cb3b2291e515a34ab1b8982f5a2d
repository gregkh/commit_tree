ext4: Fix buffer double free in ext4_alloc_branch()

Error recovery in ext4_alloc_branch() calls ext4_forget() even for
buffer corresponding to indirect block it did not allocate. This leads
to brelse() being called twice for that buffer (once from ext4_forget()
and once from cleanup in ext4_ind_map_blocks()) leading to buffer use
count misaccounting. Eventually (but often much later because there
are other users of the buffer) we will see messages like:
VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer

Another manifestation of this problem is an error:
JBD2 unexpected failure: jbd2_journal_revoke: !buffer_revoked(bh);
inconsistent data on disk

The fix is easy - don't forget buffer we did not allocate. Also add an
explanatory comment because the indexing at ext4_alloc_branch() is
somewhat subtle.
