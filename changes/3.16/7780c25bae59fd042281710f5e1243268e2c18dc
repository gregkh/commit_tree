perf tools: Allow ability to map cpus to nodes easily

This patch figures out the max number of cpus and nodes that are on the
system and creates a map of cpu to node.  This allows us to provide a cpu
and quickly get the node associated with it.

It was mostly copied from builtin-kmem.c and tweaked slightly to use less memory
(use possible cpus instead of max).  It also calculates the max number of nodes.
