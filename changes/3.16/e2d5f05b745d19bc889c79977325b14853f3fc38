thermal: armada: Support Armada 375 SoC

Now that a generic infrastructure is in place, it's possible to support
the new Armada 375 SoC thermal sensor. This sensor is similar to the one
available in the already supported SoCs, with its specific temperature formula
and specific sensor initialization.

In addition, we also add support for the Z1 SoC stepping, which needs
an initialization-quirk to work properly.
