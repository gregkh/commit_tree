give ->direct_IO() a copy of iov_iter

the thing is, we want to advance what's given to ->direct_IO() as we
are forming the request; however, the callers care about the amount
of data actually transferred, not the amount we tried to transfer.
It's more convenient to allow ->direct_IO() instances do use
iov_iter_advance() on the copy of iov_iter, leaving the actual
advancing of the original to caller.
