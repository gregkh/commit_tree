be2net: support flashing new regions on Skyhawk-R

Certain new flash regions have been added to Skyhawk-R FW image. The newer
FW images specify op_types for each region. A region is flashed only
when it's CRC doesn't match that of the region on the HW flash. While
upgrading to a new FW image the driver is expected to tolerate certain
errors.

This patch re-factors code under be_flash() to support the above scheme.
