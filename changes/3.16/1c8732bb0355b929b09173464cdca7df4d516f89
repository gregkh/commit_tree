gpio: support threaded interrupts in irqchip helpers

Some off-chip GPIO expanders need to be communicated by I2C or
SPI traffic, but may still support IRQs. By the sleeping nature
of such buses, such IRQ handlers need to be threaded. Support
such handlers in the gpiochip irqchip helpers by flagging IRQs
as threaded if the .can_sleep property of the gpiochip is
true.

Helpfully deny registration of chained IRQ handlers if the
.can_sleep property is set, as such chips will invariably need
a nested handler rather than a chained handler.
