Revert "drm/i915: Don't set the 8to6 dither flag when not scaling"

This reverts commit 773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c.

It is very much needed and the lack of dithering has been reported by
a large list of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

Also, the original patch was complete non-sense since the WARNING
backtraces in the references bugzilla are about
gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits mismatch, not at all about the dither bit.
That one seems to work.
