MIPS: smp-cps: hotplug support

This patch adds support for offlining CPUs via hotplug when using the
CONFIG_MIPS_CPS SMP implementation. When a CPU is offlined one of 2
things will happen:

  - If the CPU is part of a core which implements the MT ASE and there
    is at least one other VPE online within that core then the VPE will
    be halted by settings its TCHalt bit.

  - Otherwise if supported the core will be powered down via the CPC.

  - Otherwise the CPU will hang by executing an infinite loop.

Bringing CPUs back online is then a process of either clearing the
appropriate VPEs TCHalt bit or powering up the appropriate core via the
CPC. Throughout the process the struct core_boot_config vpe_mask field
must be maintained such that mips_cps_boot_vpes will start & stop the
correct VPEs.
