GFS2: Allow caching of glocks for flock

This patch removes the GLF_NOCACHE flag from the glocks associated with
flocks. There should be no good reason not to cache glocks for flocks:
they only force the glock to be demoted before they can be reacquired,
which can slow down performance and even cause glock hangs, especially
in cases where the flocks are held in Shared (SH) mode.
