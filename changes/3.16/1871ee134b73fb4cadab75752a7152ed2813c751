libata: support the ata host which implements a queue depth less than 32

The sata on fsl mpc8315e is broken after the commit 8a4aeec8d2d6
("libata/ahci: accommodate tag ordered controllers"). The reason is
that the ata controller on this SoC only implement a queue depth of
16. When issuing the commands in tag order, all the commands in tag
16 ~ 31 are mapped to tag 0 unconditionally and then causes the sata
malfunction. It makes no senses to use a 32 queue in software while
the hardware has less queue depth. So consider the queue depth
implemented by the hardware when requesting a command tag.
