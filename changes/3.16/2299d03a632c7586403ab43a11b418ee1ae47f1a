powerpc: powernv: Framework to show the correct clock in /proc/cpuinfo

Currently, the code in setup-common.c for powerpc assumes that all
clock rates are same in a smp system. This value is cached in the
variable named ppc_proc_freq and is the value that is reported in
/proc/cpuinfo.

However on the PowerNV platform, the clock rate is same only across
the threads of the same core. Hence the value that is reported in
/proc/cpuinfo is incorrect on PowerNV platforms. We need a better way
to query and report the correct value of the processor clock in
/proc/cpuinfo.

The patch achieves this by creating a machdep_call named
get_proc_freq() which is expected to returns the frequency in Hz. The
code in show_cpuinfo() can invoke this method to display the correct
clock rate on platforms that have implemented this method. On the
other powerpc platforms it can use the value cached in ppc_proc_freq.
