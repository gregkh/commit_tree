ath10k: fix core start sequence

It was possible to call hif_stop() 2 times through
ath10k_htc_connect_init() timeout failpath which
could lead to double free_irq() kernel splat for
multiple MSI interrupt case.

Re-order init sequence to avoid this problem. The
HTC stop shouldn't stop HIF implicitly since it
doesn't implicitly start it. Since the re-ordering
required some functions to be split/removed/renamed
rename a few functions to make more sense while at
it.
