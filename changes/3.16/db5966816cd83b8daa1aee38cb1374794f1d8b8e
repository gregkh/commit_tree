Bluetooth: Return EOPNOTSUPP for HCISETRAW ioctl command

The HCISETRAW ioctl command is not really useful. To utilize raw and
direct access to the HCI controller, the HCI User Channel feature has
been introduced. Return EOPNOTSUPP to indicate missing support for
this command.

For legacy reasons hcidump used to use HCISETRAW for permission check
to return proper error codes to users. To keep backwards compability
return EPERM in case the caller does not have CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
