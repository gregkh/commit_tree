ALSA: fireworks: Add transaction and some commands

Fireworks uses own command and response. This commit adds functionality to
transact and adds some commands required for sound card instance and kernel
streaming.

There are two ways to deliver substance of this transaction:
1.AV/C vendor dependent command for command/response
2.Async transaction to specific addresses for command/response

By way 1, I confirm AudioFire12 cannot correctly response to some commands with
firmware version 5.0 or later. This is also confirmed by FFADO. So this driver
implement way 2.

The address for response gives an issue. When this driver allocate own callback
function into the address, then no one can allocate its own callback function.
This situation is not good for applications in user-land. This issue is solved
in later commit.

I note there is a command to change the address for response if the device
supports. But this driver uses default value. So users should not execute this
command as long as hoping this driver works correctly.
