NFC: trf7970a: Add 'autosuspend-delay' DTS property

The trf7970a driver currently uses a fixed autosuspend delay of 30 seconds.
To enable users to customize the delay as they see fit, add support for the
new 'autosuspend-delay' DTS property (part of the nfc node) which can
override the default 30 seconds.
