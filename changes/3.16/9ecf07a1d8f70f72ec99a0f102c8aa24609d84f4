neigh: sysctl - simplify address calculation of gc_* variables

The code in neigh_sysctl_register() relies on a specific layout of
struct neigh_table, namely that the 'gc_*' variables are directly
following the 'parms' member in a specific order. The code, though,
expresses this in the most ugly way.

Get rid of the ugly casts and use the 'tbl' pointer to get a handle to
the table. This way we can refer to the 'gc_*' variables directly.

Similarly seen in the grsecurity patch, written by Brad Spengler.
