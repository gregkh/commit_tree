ARM: mvebu: remove the address parameter for ll_set_cpu_coherent

In order to be able to deal with the MMU enabled and the MMU disabled
cases, the base address of the coherency registers was passed to the
function. The address by itself was not interesting as it can't change
for a given SoC, the only thing we need is to have a distinction
between the physical or the virtual address.

This patch add a check of the MMU bit to choose the accurate address,
then the calling function doesn't have to pass this information.
