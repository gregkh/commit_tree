powerpc/ftrace: Fix ABIv2 issues with __ftrace_make_call

__ftrace_make_call assumed ABIv1 TOC stack offsets, so it
broke on ABIv2.

While we are here, we can simplify the instruction modification
code. Since we always update one instruction there is no need to
probe_kernel_write and flush_icache_range, just use patch_branch.
