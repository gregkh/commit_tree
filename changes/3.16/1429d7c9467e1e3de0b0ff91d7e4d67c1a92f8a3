blk-mq: switch ctx pending map to the sparser blk_align_bitmap

Each hardware queue has a bitmap of software queues with pending
requests. When new IO is queued on a software queue, the bit is
set, and when IO is pruned on a hardware queue run, the bit is
cleared. This causes a lot of traffic. Switch this from the regular
BITS_PER_LONG bitmap to a sparser layout, similarly to what was
done for blk-mq tagging.

20% performance increase was observed for single threaded IO, and
about 15% performanc increase on multiple threads driving the
same device.
