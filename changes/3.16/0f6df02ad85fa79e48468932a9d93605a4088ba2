staging: rtl8723au: Fix endian abnormality in mlme_evt_hdl23a()

Every other place uses C2HEvent_Header() for events. Given the struct
is endian dependant, use it here too to retrieve data from the parm
buffer.

Note the length field is not set/read in le order - question is
whether it's simply an opaque field?
