net: fec: optimize the clock management to save power

Add below clock management to save fec power:
- After probe, disable all clocks incluing ipg, ahb, enet_out, ptp clock.
- Open ethx interface enable necessary clocks.
  Close ethx interface disable all clocks.

The patch also encapsulates the all enet clocks enable/disable to
.fec_enet_clk_enable(), which can reduce the repetitional code in
driver.
