staging: rtl8723au: pass the cmd parm buffer directly to the cmd handler

commit 0348dc74f6689825c16db40fbe0ce6ad2da5bab9 ensured that the parm
buffer passed to the cmd handlers is not being over-written. Hence
there is no need to make a copy of the parm buffer just to pass it
into the cmd handler.
