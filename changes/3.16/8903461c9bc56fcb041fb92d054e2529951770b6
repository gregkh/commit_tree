powerpc/perf: Fix MMCR2 handling for EBB

In the recent commit b50a6c584bb4 "Clear MMCR2 when enabling PMU", I
screwed up the handling of MMCR2 for tasks using EBB.

We must make sure we set MMCR2 *before* ebb_switch_in(), otherwise we
overwrite the value of MMCR2 that userspace may have written. That
potentially breaks a task that uses EBB and manually uses MMCR2 for
event freezing.
