staging: comedi: pass subdevice to __comedi_buf_write_alloc()

Local function `__comedi_buf_write_alloc()` is called by
`comedi_buf_write_alloc()` and `comedi_buf_put()`.  It currently takes a
pointer to a `struct comedi_async`.  Change it to take a pointer to a
`struct comedi_subdevice` and use the `async` member for consistency
with other comedi buffer handling functions.
