sched/deadline: Delete extraneous extern for to_ratio()

There was a prototype for it added to kernel/sched/sched.h
at the same time the extern was added, so the extern in
the C file was never really ever needed.

See commit 332ac17ef5bfcff4766dfdfd3b4cdf10b8f8f155
("sched/deadline: Add bandwidth management for SCHED_DEADLINE
tasks") for details.
