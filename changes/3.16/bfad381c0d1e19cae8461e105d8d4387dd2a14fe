x86/vdso: Improve the fake section headers

Fully stripping the vDSO has other unfortunate side effects:

 - binutils is unable to find ELF notes without a SHT_NOTE section.

 - Even elfutils has trouble: it can find ELF notes without a section
   table at all, but if a section table is present, it won't look for
   PT_NOTE.

 - gdb wants section names to match between stripped DSOs and their
   symbols; otherwise it will corrupt symbol addresses.

We're also breaking the rules: section 0 is supposed to be SHT_NULL.

Fix these problems by building a better fake section table.  While
we're at it, we might as well let buggy Go versions keep working well
by giving the SHT_DYNSYM entry the correct size.

This is a bit unfortunate: it adds quite a bit of size to the vdso
image.

If/when binutils improves and the improved versions become widespread,
it would be worth considering dropping most of this.
