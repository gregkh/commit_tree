HSI: Introduce OMAP SSI driver

Add OMAP SSI driver to the HSI subsystem.

The Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) is a legacy version
of HSI. As in the case of HSI, it is mainly used to connect
Application engines (APE) with cellular modem engines (CMT)
in cellular handsets.

It provides a multichannel, full-duplex, multi-core communication
with no reference clock. The OMAP SSI block is capable of reaching
speeds of 110 Mbit/s.
