cgroup: enable refcnting for root csses

Currently, css_get(), css_tryget() and css_tryget_online() are noops
for root csses as an optimization; however, we're planning to use css
refcnts to track of cgroup lifetime too and root cgroups also need to
be reference counted.  Since css has been converted to percpu_refcnt,
the overhead of refcnting is miniscule and this optimization isn't too
meaningful anymore.  Furthermore, controllers which optimize the root
cgroup often never even invoke these functions in their hot paths.

This patch enables refcnting for root csses too.  This makes CSS_ROOT
flag unused and removes it.
