serial: kgdb_nmi: Use container_of() to locate private data

This corrects a crash in kgdb_nmi_tty_shutdown() which occurs when
the function is called with port->tty set to NULL.

All conversions between struct tty_port and struct kgdb_nmi_tty_priv
have been switched to direct calls to container_of() to improve code
clarity and consistancy.
