sched/fair: Remove "power" from 'struct numa_stats'

It is better not to think about compute capacity as being equivalent
to "CPU power".  The upcoming "power aware" scheduler work may create
confusion with the notion of energy consumption if "power" is used too
liberally.

To make things explicit and not create more confusion with the existing
"capacity" member, let's rename things as follows:

	power    -> compute_capacity
	capacity -> task_capacity

Note: none of those fields are actually used outside update_numa_stats().
