pinctrl: dra: dt-bindings: Fix pull enable/disable

The DRA74/72 control module pins have a weak pull up and pull down.
This is configured by bit offset 17. if BIT(17) is 1, a pull up is
selected, else a pull down is selected.

However, this pull resisstor is applied based on BIT(16) -
PULLUDENABLE - if BIT(18) is *0*, then pull as defined in BIT(17) is
applied, else no weak pulls are applied. We defined this in reverse.

bits) in Technical Reference Manual Revision (DRA74x revision Q:
SPRUHI2Q Revised June 2014 and DRA72x revision F: SPRUHP2F - Revised
