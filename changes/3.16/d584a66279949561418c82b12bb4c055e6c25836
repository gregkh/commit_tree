firewire: ohci: disable MSI for VIA VT6315 again

Revert half of commit d151f9854f21:  If isochronous I/O is attempted with
packets larget than 1 kByte, VIA VT6315 rev 01 immediately stops to generate
any interrupts if MSI are used.  Fix this by going back to legacy interrupts.
[Thread "Isochronous streaming with VT6315 OHCI",
http://marc.info/?t=139049641500003]

With smaller packets, the loss of IRQs happens too but only very rarely ---
rarely eneough that it was not yet possible for me to determine whether
QUIRK_NO_MSI is an actual fix for this rare variation of this chip bug.

I am keeping QUIRK_CYCLE_TIMER off of VT6315 rev >= 1 because this has been
verified by myself with certainty.  On the other hand, I am also keeping
QUIRK_CYCLE_TIMER on for VT6315 rev 0 because I don't know at this time
whether this revision accesses Cycle Timer non-atomically like most of the
other VIA OHCIs are known to do.
