vt: Don't ignore unbind errors in vt_unbind

Otherwise the loop will never stop since we don't make any
forward progress. Noticed while breaking this accidentally
in a painful attempt to make vga_con unregistering work.

With this patch we'll bail out on the first attempt, which
at least leaves a useful enough system behind for debugging.
Livelocks on console_lock just aren't fun.
