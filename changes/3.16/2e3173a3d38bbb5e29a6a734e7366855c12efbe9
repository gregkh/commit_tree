net: mvneta: Avoid unmapping the TSO header buffers

The buffers for the TSO headers belong to a DMA coherent region which is
allocated at ndo_open() time, and released at ndo_stop() time.

Therefore, and contrary to the TSO payload descriptor buffers, the TSO header
buffers don't need to be unmapped. This commit adds a check to detect a
TSO header buffer and explicitly prevent the unmap.
