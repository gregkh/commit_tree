net: sh_eth: Fix receive packet "exceeded" condition in sh_eth_rx()

This patch fixes the packet "exceeded" condition in sh_eth_rx() when
RACT in an RX descriptor is not set and the "quota" is 0.
Otherwise, kernel panic happens because the "&n->poll_list" is deleted
twice in sh_eth_poll() which calls napi_complete() and net_rx_action().
