crypto: caam - Kill the easy targets

Fix the functions which can be obviously done right with a simple
dev_err() now. While at it, further press the on-stack allocation
of buffer for sprintf() voodoo down into the abominated functions.

This patch cleans up most of the functions and leaves just two
remaining functions, report_ccb_status() and report_deco_status()
ugly and unhappy.
