net: Save software checksum complete

In skb_checksum complete, if we need to compute the checksum for the
packet (via skb_checksum) save the result as CHECKSUM_COMPLETE.
Subsequent checksum verification can use this.

Also, added csum_complete_sw flag to distinguish between software and
hardware generated checksum complete, we should always be able to trust
the software computation.
