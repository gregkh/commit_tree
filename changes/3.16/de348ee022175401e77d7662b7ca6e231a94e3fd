Btrfs: make sure there are not any read requests before stopping workers

In close_ctree(), after we have stopped all workers,there maybe still
some read requests(for example readahead) to submit and this *maybe* trigger
an oops that user reported before:

kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:619!

By hacking codes, i can reproduce this problem with one cpu available.
We fix this potential problem by invalidating all btree inode pages before
stopping all workers.

Thanks to Miao for pointing out this problem.
