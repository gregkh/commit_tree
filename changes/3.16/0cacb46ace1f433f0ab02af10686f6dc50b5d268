[media] fix mceusb endpoint type identification/handling

Change the I/O endpoint handling of the mceusb driver to respect the endpoint
type reported by device (bulk/interrupt), rather than treating all endpoints
as type interrupt, which breaks devices using bulk endpoints when connected
to a xhci controller.  Accordingly, change the function calls to initialize
an endpoint's transfer pipe and urb handlers to use the correct function based
on the endpoint type.
