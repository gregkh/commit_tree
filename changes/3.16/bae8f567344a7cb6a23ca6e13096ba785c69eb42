s390/spinlock,rwlock: always to a load-and-test first

In case a lock is contended it is better to do a load-and-test first
before trying to get the lock with compare-and-swap. This helps to avoid
unnecessary cache invalidations of the cacheline for the lock if the
CPU has to wait for the lock. For an uncontended lock doing the
compare-and-swap directly is a bit better, if the CPU does not have the
cacheline in its cache yet the compare-and-swap will get it read-write
immediately while a load-and-test would get it read-only first.

Always to the load-and-test first to avoid the cacheline invalidations
for the contended case outweight the potential read-only to read-write
cacheline upgrade for the uncontended case.
