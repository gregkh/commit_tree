raid5: speedup sync_request processing

The raid5 sync_request() processing calls handle_stripe() within the context of
the resync-thread.  The resync-thread issues the first set of read requests
and this adds execution latency and slows down the scheduling of the next
sync_request().
The current rebuild/resync speed of raid5 is not much faster than what
rotational HDDs can sustain.
Testing the following patch on a 6-drive array, I can increase the rebuild
speed from 100 MB/s to 175 MB/s.
The sync_request() now just sets STRIPE_HANDLE and releases the stripe.  This
creates some more parallelism between the resync-thread and raid5 kernel daemon.
