KVM: MMU: properly check last spte in fast_page_fault()

Using sp->role.level instead of @level since @level is not got from the
page table hierarchy

There is no issue in current code since the fast page fault currently only
fixes the fault caused by dirty-log that is always on the last level
(level = 1)

This patch makes the code more readable and avoids potential issue in the
further development
