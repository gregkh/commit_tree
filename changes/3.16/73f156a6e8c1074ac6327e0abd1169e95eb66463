inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count

Ideally, we would need to generate IP ID using a per destination IP
generator.

linux kernels used inet_peer cache for this purpose, but this had a huge
cost on servers disabling MTU discovery.

1) each inet_peer struct consumes 192 bytes

2) inetpeer cache uses a binary tree of inet_peer structs,
   with a nominal size of ~66000 elements under load.

3) lookups in this tree are hitting a lot of cache lines, as tree depth
   is about 20.

4) If server deals with many tcp flows, we have a high probability of
   not finding the inet_peer, allocating a fresh one, inserting it in
   the tree with same initial ip_id_count, (cf secure_ip_id())

5) We garbage collect inet_peer aggressively.

IP ID generation do not have to be 'perfect'

Goal is trying to avoid duplicates in a short period of time,
so that reassembly units have a chance to complete reassembly of
fragments belonging to one message before receiving other fragments
with a recycled ID.

We simply use an array of generators, and a Jenkin hash using the dst IP
as a key.

ipv6_select_ident() is put back into net/ipv6/ip6_output.c where it
belongs (it is only used from this file)

secure_ip_id() and secure_ipv6_id() no longer are needed.

Rename ip_select_ident_more() to ip_select_ident_segs() to avoid
unnecessary decrement/increment of the number of segments.
