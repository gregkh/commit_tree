cgroup: nest kernfs active protection under cgroup_mutex

After the recent cgroup_kn_lock_live() changes, cgroup_mutex is no
longer nested below kernfs active protection.  The two don't have any
relationship now.

This patch nests kernfs active protection under cgroup_mutex.  All
cftype operations now require both cgroup_tree_mutex and cgroup_mutex,
temporary cgroup_mutex releases over kernfs operations are removed,
and cgroup_add/rm_cftypes() grab both mutexes.

This makes cgroup_tree_mutex redundant, which will be removed by the
next patch.
