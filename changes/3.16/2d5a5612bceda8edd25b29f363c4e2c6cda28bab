arm64: Limit the CMA buffer to 32-bit if ZONE_DMA

When the CMA buffer is allocated, it is too early to know whether
devices will require ZONE_DMA memory. This patch limits the CMA buffer
to (DMA_BIT_MASK(32) + 1) if CONFIG_ZONE_DMA is enabled.

In addition, it computes the dma_to_phys(DMA_BIT_MASK(32)) before the
increment (no current functional change).
