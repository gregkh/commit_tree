drm/i915: Perform primary enable/disable atomically with sprite updates

Move the primary plane enable/disable to occur atomically with the
sprite update that caused the primary plane visibility to change.

FBC and IPS enable/disable is left to happen well before or after
the primary plane change.

v2: Pass intel_crtc instead of drm_crtc (Daniel)
