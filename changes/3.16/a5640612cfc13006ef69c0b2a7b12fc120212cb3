wl1251: fix null data for IBSS

Fix the WARN below by not calling ieee80211_nullfunc_get() in IBSS mode,
but setting up empty template the same way wl12xx driver does.

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 914 at net/mac80211/tx.c:2750 ieee80211_nullfunc_get+0xc0/0xd0 [mac80211]()

Also perform join command regardless of bss_type as that seems to be
required for proper operation.
