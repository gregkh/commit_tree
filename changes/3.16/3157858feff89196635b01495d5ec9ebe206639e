arm64: split syscall_trace() into separate functions for enter/exit

As done in arm, this change makes it easy to confirm we invoke syscall
related hooks, including syscall tracepoint, audit and seccomp which would
be implemented later, in correct order. That is, undoing operations in the
opposite order on exit that they were done on entry.
