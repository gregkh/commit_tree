Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix a bug in the channel callback dispatch code

Starting with Win8, we have implemented several optimizations to improve the
scalability and performance of the VMBUS transport between the Host and the
Guest. Some of the non-performance critical services cannot leverage these
optimization since they only read and process one message at a time.
Make adjustments to the callback dispatch code to account for the way
non-performance critical drivers handle reading of the channel.
