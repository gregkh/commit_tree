nfsd4: convert 4.1 replay encoding

Limits on maxresp_sz mean that we only ever need to replay rpc's that
are contained entirely in the head.

The one exception is very small zero-copy reads.  That's an odd corner
case as clients wouldn't normally ask those to be cached.

in any case, this seems a little more robust.
