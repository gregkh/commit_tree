lockdep: Let lock_is_held_type() detect recursive read as read

lock_is_held_type(, 1) detects acquired read locks. It only recognized
locks acquired with lock_acquire_shared(). Read locks acquired with
lock_acquire_shared_recursive() are not recognized because a `2' is
stored as the read value.

Rework the check to additionally recognise lock's read value one and two
as a read held lock.
