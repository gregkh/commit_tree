ethtool: handle info/flash data copying outside rtnl_lock

We need to increase the lifetime of the data for .get_info
and .flash_update beyond their handlers inside rtnl_lock.

Allocate a union on the heap and use it instead.

Note that we now copy the ethcmd before we lookup dev,
hopefully there is no crazy user space depending on error
codes.
