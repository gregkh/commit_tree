Add 'tools/perf/libbpf/' to ignored files

Commit 6b491a86b77c ("perf build: Install libbpf headers locally when
building") installed copies of the libbpf headers into the build tree,
causing unnecessary noise from 'git status' after a perf tools build.

Add the 'libbpf/' subdirectory to the .gitignore file to silence it all
again.
