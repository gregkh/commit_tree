gpio: mc33880: Drop if with an always false condition

An spi remove callback is only called for devices that probed
successfully. In this case this implies that mc33880_probe() set a
non-NULL driver data. So the check for mc being NULL is never true and
the check can be dropped.

Also the return value ofspi remove callbacks is ignored anyway.
