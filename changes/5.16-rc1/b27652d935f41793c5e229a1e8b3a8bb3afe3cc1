mm/filemap: Add FGP_STABLE

Allow filemap_get_folio() to wait for writeback to complete (if the
filesystem wants that behaviour).  This is the folio equivalent of
grab_cache_page_write_begin(), which is moved into the folio-compat
file as a reminder to migrate all the code using it.  This paves the
way for getting rid of AOP_FLAG_NOFS once grab_cache_page_write_begin()
is removed.

Kernel grows by 11 bytes.  filemap_get_folio() grows by 33 bytes but
grab_cache_page_write_begin() shrinks by 22 bytes to make up for it.
