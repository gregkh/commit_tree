staging: r8188eu: change the type of a variable in rtw_write16()

Change the type of "data" from __le32 to __le16 in rtw_write16(). The
argument "val", which is u16, after being conditionally swapped to little
endian, is assigned to "data"; therefore, __le16 is the most suitable type
for "data". Remove the bitwise AND of "val" with 0xffff because it is
redundant. Use cpu_to_le16() because "data" is __le16.
