Input: goodix - refactor reset handling

Refactor reset handling a bit, change the main reset handler
into a new goodix_reset_no_int_sync() helper and add a
goodix_reset() wrapper which calls goodix_int_sync()
separately.

Also push the dev_err() call on reset failure into the
goodix_reset_no_int_sync() and goodix_int_sync() functions,
so that we don't need to have separate dev_err() calls in
all their callers.

This is a preparation patch for adding support for controllers
without flash, which need to have their firmware uploaded and
need some other special handling too.
