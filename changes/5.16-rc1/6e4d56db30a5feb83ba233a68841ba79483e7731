Revert "platform/x86: i2c-multi-instantiate: Don't create platform device for INT3515 ACPI nodes"

This reverts commit 9bba96275576da0cf78ede62aeb2fc975ed8a32d.

The above commit was added to prevent the tipd driver from loading
in devices which have INT3515 ACPI nodes since high CPU load was
reported in these devices due to interrupt flood. Now that the issue
of interrupt flood in the tipd driver is fixed, re-enable the creation
of platform device for INT3515 ACPI nodes.
