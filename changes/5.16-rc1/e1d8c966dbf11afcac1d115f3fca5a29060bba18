mm/page_isolation: fix potential missing call to unset_migratetype_isolate()

In start_isolate_page_range() undo path, pfn_to_online_page() just
checks the first pfn in a pageblock while __first_valid_page() will
traverse the pageblock until the first online pfn is found.  So we may
miss the call to unset_migratetype_isolate() in undo path and pages will
remain isolated unexpectedly.

Fix this by calling undo_isolate_page_range() and this will also help to
simplify the code further.  Note we shouldn't ever trigger it because
MAX_ORDER-1 aligned pfn ranges shouldn't contain memory holes now.
