btrfs: defrag: use defrag_one_cluster() to implement btrfs_defrag_file()

The function defrag_one_cluster() is able to defrag one range well
enough, we only need to do preparation for it, including:

- Clamp and align the defrag range
- Exclude invalid cases
- Proper inode locking

The old infrastructures will not be removed in this patch, as it would
be too noisy to review.
