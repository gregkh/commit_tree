KVM: x86: inhibit APICv when KVM_GUESTDBG_BLOCKIRQ active

KVM_GUESTDBG_BLOCKIRQ relies on interrupts being injected using
standard kvm's inject_pending_event, and not via APICv/AVIC.

Since this is a debug feature, just inhibit APICv/AVIC while
KVM_GUESTDBG_BLOCKIRQ is in use on at least one vCPU.
