docs: block: fix discard_max_bytes references

When discard_max_hw_bytes was introduced, in commit 0034af036554
("block: make /sys/block/<dev>/queue/discard_max_bytes writeable"),
the discard_max_bytes documentation section was renamed to
discard_max_hw_bytes, but the references it contains to
discard_max_bytes weren't updated.

This patch refers to discard_max_hw_bytes instead. It also reflows the
paragraph so that sentences end lines.
