MIPS: loongson64: Fix no screen display during boot-up

The Framebuffer CONFIG_FB needs to be explicitly selected or we
don't get any framebuffer anymore. DRM has stopped to select FB
after commit f611b1e7624ccdbd495c19e98056 ("drm: Avoid circular
dependencies for CONFIG_FB") because of circular dependency. So
we should enable it in the default config file, otherwise there
is no display before Xorg.
