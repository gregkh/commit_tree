ASoC: cs42l42: Don't claim to support 192k

The driver currently only supports configuring for sample rates <= 96k
and it isn't possible to setup a configuration that will support all
sample rates up to 192k.

For sample rates up to 96k MCLK is in the 12MHz group.
However, although 192k only requires an I2S clock in the 12MHz group,
the cs42l42 audio path is not natively 192k so the audio must be
resampled. But for 192k the SRC requires a 24MHz MCLK.

It is not possible to switch MCLK between 12MHz and 24MHz groups
on-the-fly. The 12MHz group supports all sample rates up to 96k.
