xen/x86: streamline set_pte_mfn()

In preparation for restoring xen_set_pte_init()'s original behavior of
avoiding hypercalls, make set_pte_mfn() no longer use the standard
set_pte() code path. That one is more complicated than the alternative
of simply using an available hypercall directly. This way we can avoid
introducing a fair number (2k on my test system) of cases where the
hypervisor would trap-and-emulate page table updates.
