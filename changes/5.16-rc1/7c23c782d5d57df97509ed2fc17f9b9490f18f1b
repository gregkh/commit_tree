mm/filemap: Add folio_lock()

This is like lock_page() but for use by callers who know they have a folio.
Convert __lock_page() to be __folio_lock().  This saves one call to
compound_head() per contended call to lock_page().

Saves 455 bytes of text; mostly from improved register allocation and
inlining decisions.  __folio_lock is 59 bytes while __lock_page was 79.
