signal/sparc: In setup_tsb_params convert open coded BUG into BUG

The function setup_tsb_params has exactly one caller tsb_grow.  The
function tsb_grow passes in a tsb_bytes value that is between 8192 and
1048576 inclusive, and is guaranteed to be a power of 2.  The function
setup_tsb_params verifies this property with a switch statement and
then prints an error and causes the task to exit if this is not true.

In practice that print statement can never be reached because tsb_grow
never passes in a bad tsb_size.  So if tsb_size ever gets a bad value
that is a kernel bug.

So replace the do_exit which is effectively an open coded version of
BUG() with an actuall call to BUG().  Making it clearer that this
is a case that can never, and should never happen.
