mwifiex: Use helper function for counting interface types

Use a small helper function to increment and decrement the counter of
the interface types we currently manage. This makes the code that
actually changes and sets up the interface type a bit less messy and
also helps avoiding mistakes in case someone increments/decrements a
counter wrongly.
