ACPI: PM: Check states of power resources during initialization

To avoid situations in which the actual states of certain ACPI power
resources are not known just because they have never been referenced
by any device configuration objects, check the initial states of all
power resources as soon as they are found in the ACPI namespace (and
fall back to turning them on if the state check fails).
