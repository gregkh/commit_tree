powerpc/fsl_booke: Rename fsl_booke.c to fsl_book3e.c

We have a myriad of CONFIG symbols around different variants
of BOOKEs, which would be worth tidying up one day.

But at least, make file names and CONFIG option match:

We have CONFIG_FSL_BOOKE and CONFIG_PPC_FSL_BOOK3E.

fsl_booke.c is selected by and only by CONFIG_PPC_FSL_BOOK3E.
So rename it fsl_book3e to reduce confusion.
