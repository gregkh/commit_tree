drm/i915/uncore: Associate shadow table with uncore

Store a reference to a platform's shadow table inside the uncore, the
same as we do with the forcewake table.  This will allow us to use a
single set of functions that operate on the shadow table reference
rather than generating lots of nearly-identical functions via macros
that differ only in terms of the table that they reference.
