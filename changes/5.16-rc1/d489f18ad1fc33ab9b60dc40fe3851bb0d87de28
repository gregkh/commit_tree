scsi: ufs: core: Fix synchronization between scsi_unjam_host() and ufshcd_queuecommand()

The SCSI error handler calls scsi_unjam_host() which can call the queue
function ufshcd_queuecommand() indirectly. The error handler changes the
state to UFSHCD_STATE_RESET while running, but error interrupts that
happen while the error handler is running could change the state to
UFSHCD_STATE_EH_SCHEDULED_NON_FATAL which would allow requests to go
through ufshcd_queuecommand() even though the error handler is running.
Block that hole by checking whether the error handler is in progress.
