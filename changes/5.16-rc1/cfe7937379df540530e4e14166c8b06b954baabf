staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of usb_write_port()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_write_port() and usb_write_port() and embed
their code into the caller (i.e., rtw_write_port()).

_rtw_write_port() is a mere redefinition of rtw_write_port() and it is
unneeded. usb_write_port() was the only functions assigned to the
(*_usb_write_port) pointer, so we can simply remove it and make a direct
call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
