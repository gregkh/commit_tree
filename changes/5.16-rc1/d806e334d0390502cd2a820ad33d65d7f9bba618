mmc: sdhci-omap: Fix context restore

We need to restore context in a specified order with HCTL set in two
phases. This is similar to what omap_hsmmc_context_restore() is doing.
Otherwise SDIO can stop working on resume.

And for PM runtime and SDIO cards, we need to also save SYSCTL, IE and
ISE.

This should not be a problem currently, and these patches can be applied
whenever suitable.
