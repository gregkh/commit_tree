hwmon: (mlxreg-fan) Fix out of bounds read on array fan->pwm

Array fan->pwm[] is MLXREG_FAN_MAX_PWM elements in size, however the
for-loop has a off-by-one error causing index i to be out of range
causing an out of bounds read on the array. Fix this by replacing
the <= operator with < in the for-loop.
