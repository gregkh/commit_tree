PCI/sysfs: Return -EINVAL consistently from "store" functions

Most of the "store" functions that handle userspace input via sysfs return
-EINVAL should the value fail validation and/or type conversion.  This
error code is a clear message to userspace that the value is not a valid
input.

However, some of the "show" functions return input parsing error codes
as-is, which may be either -EINVAL or -ERANGE.  The former would often be
from kstrtobool(), and the latter typically from other kstr*() functions
such as kstrtou8(), kstrtou32(), kstrtoint(), etc.

-EINVAL is commonly returned as the error code to indicate that the value
provided is invalid, but -ERANGE is not very useful in userspace.

Therefore, normalize the return error code to be -EINVAL for when the
validation and/or type conversion fails.
