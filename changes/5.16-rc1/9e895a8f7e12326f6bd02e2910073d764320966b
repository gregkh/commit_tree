btrfs: use async_chunk::async_cow to replace the confusing pending pointer

For structure async_chunk, we use a very strange member layout to grab
structure async_cow who owns this async_chunk.

At initialization, it goes like this:

		async_chunk[i].pending = &ctx->num_chunks;

Then at async_cow_free() we do a super weird freeing:

	/*
	 * Since the pointer to 'pending' is at the beginning of the array of
	 * async_chunk's, freeing it ensures the whole array has been freed.
	 */
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(async_chunk->pending))
		kvfree(async_chunk->pending);

This is absolutely an abuse of kvfree().

Replace async_chunk::pending with async_chunk::async_cow, so that we can
grab the async_cow structure directly, without this strange dancing.

And with this change, there is no requirement for any specific member
location.
