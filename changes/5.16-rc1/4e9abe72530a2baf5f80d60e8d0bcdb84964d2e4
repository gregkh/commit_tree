swim: add helper for disk cleanup

Disk cleanup can be shared between exit and bringup. Use a
helper to do the work required. The only functional change at
this point is we're being overly paraoid on exit to check for
a null disk as well now, and this should be safe.

We'll later expand on this, this change just makes subsequent
changes easier to read.
