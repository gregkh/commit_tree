sh: define __BIG_ENDIAN for math-emu

Fix this by defining both ENDIAN macros in
<asm/sfp-machine.h> so that they can be utilized in
<math-emu/soft-fp.h> according to the latter's comment:
/* Allow sfp-machine to have its own byte order definitions. */

(This is what is done in arch/nds32/include/asm/sfp-machine.h.)

This placates these build warnings:

In file included from ../arch/sh/math-emu/math.c:23:
.../include/math-emu/single.h:50:21: warning: "__BIG_ENDIAN" is not defined, evaluates to 0 [-Wundef]
   50 | #if __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN
In file included from ../arch/sh/math-emu/math.c:24:
.../include/math-emu/double.h:59:21: warning: "__BIG_ENDIAN" is not defined, evaluates to 0 [-Wundef]
   59 | #if __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN
