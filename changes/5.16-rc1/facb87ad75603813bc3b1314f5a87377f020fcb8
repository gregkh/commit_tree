clk: at91: sama7g5: remove prescaler part of master clock

On SAMA7G5 the prescaler part of master clock has been implemented as a
changeable one. Everytime the prescaler is changed the PMC_SR.MCKRDY bit
must be polled. Value 1 for PMC_SR.MCKRDY means the prescaler update is
done. Driver polls for this bit until it becomes 1. On SAMA7G5 it has
been discovered that in some conditions the PMC_SR.MCKRDY is not rising
but the rate it provides it's stable. The workaround is to add a timeout
when polling for PMC_SR.MCKRDY. At the moment, for SAMA7G5, the prescaler
will be removed from Linux clock tree as all the frequencies for CPU could
be obtained from PLL and also there will be less overhead when changing
frequency via DVFS.
