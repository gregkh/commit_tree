drm/msm/dp: Remove global g_dp_display variable

As the Qualcomm DisplayPort driver only supports a single instance of
the driver the commonly used struct dp_display is kept in a global
variable. As we introduce additional instances this obviously doesn't
work.

Replace this with a combination of existing references to adjacent
objects and drvdata.
