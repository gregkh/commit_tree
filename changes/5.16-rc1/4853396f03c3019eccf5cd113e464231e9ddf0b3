memstick: avoid out-of-range warning

clang-14 complains about a sanity check that always passes when the
page size is 64KB or larger:

drivers/memstick/core/ms_block.c:1739:21: error: result of comparison of constant 65536 with expression of type 'unsigned short' is always false [-Werror,-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]
        if (msb->page_size > PAGE_SIZE) {
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~

This is fine, it will still work on all architectures, so just shut
up that warning with a cast.
