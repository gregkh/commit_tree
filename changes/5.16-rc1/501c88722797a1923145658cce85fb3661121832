exit/rtl8723bs: Replace the macro thread_exit with a simple return 0

Every place thread_exit is called is at the end of a function started
with kthread_run.  The code in kthread_run has arranged things so a
kernel thread can just return and do_exit will be called.

So just have the threads return instead of calling complete_and_exit.
