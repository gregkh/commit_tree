libbpf: Simplify BPF program auto-attach code

Remove the need to explicitly pass bpf_sec_def for auto-attachable BPF
programs, as it is already recorded at bpf_object__open() time for all
recognized type of BPF programs. This further reduces number of explicit
calls to find_sec_def(), simplifying further refactorings.

No functional changes are done by this patch.
