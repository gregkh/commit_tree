    drm/i915/gem: Utilize rcu iteration of context engines

Note that the other use of __context_engines_await have disappeard in
the following commits:

ccbc1b97948a ("drm/i915/gem: Don't allow changing the VM on running contexts (v4)")
c7a71fc8ee04 ("drm/i915: Drop getparam support for I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_ENGINES")
4a766ae40ec8 ("drm/i915: Drop the CONTEXT_CLONE API (v2)")

None of these have any business to optimize their engine lookup with
rcu, unless extremely convincing benchmark data and a solid analysis
why we can't make that workload (whatever it is that does) faster with
a proper design fix.

Also since there's only one caller of context_apply_all left and it's
really just a loop, inline it and then inline the lopp body too. This
is how all other callers that take the engine lock loop over engines,
it's much simpler.
