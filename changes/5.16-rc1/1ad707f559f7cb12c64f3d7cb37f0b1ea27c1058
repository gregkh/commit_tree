usb: dwc2: drd: reset current session before setting the new one

If role is changed without the "none" step, A- and B- valid session could
be set at the same time. It is an issue.
This patch resets A-session if role switch sets B-session, and resets
B-session if role switch sets A-session.
Then, it is possible to change the role without the "none" step.
