arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add device tree entries to support crypto engine

The change adds description of Qualcomm crypto engine controller and
BAM associated with it. The change is inspired by commit 3e482859f1ef
("dts: qcom: sdm845: Add dt entries to support crypto engine.")

While performance of cryptographic algorithms executed on QCE is lower
than e.g. ones tinkered for ARM NEON, the offloaded execution would
make sense:

    # cryptsetup benchmark | grep aes
    aes-cbc        128b        71.0 MiB/s        71.9 MiB/s
    aes-cbc        256b        62.4 MiB/s        62.4 MiB/s
    aes-xts        256b        70.7 MiB/s        70.8 MiB/s
    aes-xts        512b        62.0 MiB/s        63.3 MiB/s
