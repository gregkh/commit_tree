hugetlb: replace the obsolete hugetlb_instantiation_mutex in the comments

After commit 8382d914ebf7 ("mm, hugetlb: improve page-fault
scalability"), the hugetlb_instantiation_mutex lock had been replaced by
hugetlb_fault_mutex_table to serializes faults on the same logical page.

Thus update the obsolete hugetlb_instantiation_mutex related comments.
