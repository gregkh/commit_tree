USB: serial: ch314: use usb_control_msg_recv()

usb_control_msg_recv() is a new wrapper function for usb_control_msg()
that has error checks for short reads. This function also accepts data
buffer on stack. Hence use this function to simplify error handling for
short reads. Short reads will now get reported as -EREMOTEIO with no
indication of how short the transfer was.
