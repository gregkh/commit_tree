mt76: mt7915: change max rx len limit of hw modules

Update max rx len of some hw modules, which aligns out vendor SDK.
In normal modes, we exchange MPDU 7991 cap with peers; however, this
won't play a part in sniffer mode.
To prevent packets which exceed the max MPDU size from entering specific
rx path in hw, we need to set a proper limit to filter them out.
