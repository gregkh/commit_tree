drm/ttm: move ttm_tt_{add, clear}_mapping into amdgpu

Now that setting page->index shouldn't be needed anymore, we are just
left with setting page->mapping, and here it looks like amdgpu is the
only user, where pointing the page->mapping at the dev_mapping is used
to verify that the pages do indeed belong to the device, if userspace
later tries to touch them.

v2(Christian):
  - Drop the functions altogether and just inline modifying
    the page->mapping
