mips, uasm: Add workaround for Loongson-2F nop CPU errata

This patch implements a workaround for the Loongson-2F nop in generated,
code, if the existing option CONFIG_CPU_NOP_WORKAROUND is set. Before,
the binutils option -mfix-loongson2f-nop was enabled, but no workaround
was done when emitting MIPS code. Now, the nop pseudo instruction is
emitted as "or ax,ax,zero" instead of the default "sll zero,zero,0". This
is consistent with the workaround implemented by binutils.
