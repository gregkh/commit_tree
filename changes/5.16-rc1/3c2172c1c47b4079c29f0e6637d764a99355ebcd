powerpc/85xx: Fix oops when mpc85xx_smp_guts_ids node cannot be found

When the field described in mpc85xx_smp_guts_ids[] is not configured in
dtb, the mpc85xx_setup_pmc() does not assign a value to the "guts"
variable. As a result, the oops is triggered when
mpc85xx_freeze_time_base() is executed.
