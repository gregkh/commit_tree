net/mlx5: Read timeout values from init segment

Replace hard coded timeouts with values stored in firmware's init
segment. Timeouts are read from init segment during driver load. If init
segment timeouts are not supported then fallback to hard coded defaults
instead. Also move pre initialization timeouts which cannot be read from
firmware to the new mechanism.
