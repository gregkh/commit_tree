scsi: lpfc: Fix I/O block after enabling managed congestion mode

If the congestion management framework dynamically enables, it may do so
while I/O is in flight. The updates of cmf info due to inflight I/O
completing may happen before values have been initialized.

Fix by ensure cmf_max_bytes_per_interval is initialized when checking
bandwidth utilization for SCSI layer blocking.
