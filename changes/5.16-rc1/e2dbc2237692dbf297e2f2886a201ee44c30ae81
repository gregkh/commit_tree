qed: Add '_GTT' suffix to the IRO RAM macros

GTT (Global translation table) is a fast-access window in the BAR into
the register space, which only maps certain register addresses.
This change helps enforce that only those addresses which are indeed
mapped by the GTT are being accessed through it.

Adding the '_GTT' suffix to the IRO FW memory (“RAM”) macros that
access GTT-able region in FW memories (“RAM”) and use GTT macros
to access RAM BAR from drivers.
