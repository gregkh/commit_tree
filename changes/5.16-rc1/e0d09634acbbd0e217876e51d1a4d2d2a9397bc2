drm/amd/display: move bpp range decision in decide dsc bw range function

[why]
Before get dsc bw range is used to compute DSC bw range
based on the given fixed bpp min/max input.
The new change will merge any specs, signal, timing specific
bpp range decision into this function. So the function needs to make
a decision with all aspects considered.
