clk: at91: clk-master: add register definition for sama7g5's master clock

SAMA7G5 has 4 master clocks (MCK1..4) which are controlled though the
register at offset 0x30 (relative to PMC). In the last/first phase of
suspend/resume procedure (which is architecture specific) the parent
of master clocks are changed (via assembly code) for more power saving
(see file arch/arm/mach-at91/pm_suspend.S, macros at91_mckx_ps_enable
and at91_mckx_ps_restore). Thus the macros corresponding to register
at offset 0x30 need to be shared b/w clk-master.c and pm_suspend.S.
commit ec03f18cc222 ("clk: at91: add register definition for sama7g5's
master clock") introduced the proper macros but didn't adapted the
clk-master.c as well. Thus, this commit adapt the clk-master.c to use
the macros introduced in commit ec03f18cc222 ("clk: at91: add register
definition for sama7g5's master clock").
