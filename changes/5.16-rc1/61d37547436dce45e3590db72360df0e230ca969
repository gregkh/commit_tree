PCI: kirin: Reorganize the PHY logic inside the driver

The pcie-kirin PCIe driver contains internally a PHY interface for
Kirin 960.

As the next patches will add support for using an external PHY driver,
reorganize the driver in a way that the PHY part will be self-contained.

This could be moved to a separate PHY driver, but a change like that would
mean a non-backward-compatible DT schema change.
