ice: allow adding advanced rules

Define dummy packet headers to allow adding advanced rules in HW. This
header is used as admin queue command parameter for adding a rule.
The firmware will extract correct fields and will use them in look ups.

Define each supported packets header and offsets to words used in recipe.
Supported headers:
- MAC + IPv4 + UDP
- MAC + VLAN + IPv4 + UDP
- MAC + IPv4 + TCP
- MAC + VLAN + IPv4 + TCP
- MAC + IPv6 + UDP
- MAC + VLAN + IPv6 + UDP
- MAC + IPv6 + TCP
- MAC + VLAN + IPv6 + TCP

Add code for creating an advanced rule. Rule needs to match defined
dummy packet, if not return error, which means that this type of rule
isn't currently supported.

The first step in adding advanced rule is searching for an advanced
recipe matching this kind of rule. If it doesn't exist new recipe is
created. Dummy packet has to be filled with the correct header field
value from the rule definition. It will be used to do look up in HW.

Support searching for existing advance rule entry. It is used in case
of adding the same rule on different VSI. In this case, instead of
creating new rule, the existing one should be updated with refreshed VSI
list.

Add initialization for prof_res_bm_init flag to zero so that
the possible resource for fv in the files can be initialized.
