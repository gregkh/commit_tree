x86/fpu: Use EX_TYPE_FAULT_MCE_SAFE for exception fixups

The macros used for restoring FPU state from a user space buffer can handle
all exceptions including #MC. They need to return the trap number in the
error case as the code which invokes them needs to distinguish the cause of
the failure. It aborts the operation for anything except #PF.

Use the new EX_TYPE_FAULT_MCE_SAFE exception table fixup type to document
the nature of the fixup.
