dt-bindings: usb: dwc3: Fix usb-phy check

The original binding was allowing any combination of usb2-phy and
usb3-phy in the phys and phy-names properties.

However, the current binding enforces that those properties must be a
list of usb2-phy and usb3-phy, with exactly one element, effectively
making usb2-phy the only value being valid.

Let's rework the properties description to allow either one or two
element picked with values either usb2-phy or usb3-phy. The rest of the
tooling makes sure that we don't get any duplicate value, so this should
be what we want.
