io_uring: add flag to not fail link after timeout

For some reason non-off IORING_OP_TIMEOUT always fails links, it's
pretty inconvenient and unnecessary limits chaining after it to hard
linking, which is far from ideal, e.g. doesn't pair well with timeout
cancellation. Add a flag forcing it to not fail links on -ETIME.
