ARM: dts: Add Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board

This adds the matching carrier for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.
Instead of xHCI USB host controller there is just a USB 2.0 interface
connected to the DWC2 controller from the BCM2711. As a result
there is a free PCIe Gen 2 socket. Also there are 2 full-size HDMI 2.0
connectors.
