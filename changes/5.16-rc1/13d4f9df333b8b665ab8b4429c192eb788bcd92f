iio: adc: aspeed: Add func to set sampling rate.

Add the function to set the sampling rate and keep the sampling period
for a driver used to wait the fresh value.
In addition, since the ADC clock is required when initializing the ADC
device, move clk_prepare_enable ahead of the initialization phase.
