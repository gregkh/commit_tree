vsprintf: Make %pGp print the hex value

All existing users of %pGp want the hex value as well as the decoded
flag names.  This looks awkward (passing the same parameter to printf
twice), so move that functionality into the core.  If we want, we
can make that optional with flag arguments to %pGp in the future.
