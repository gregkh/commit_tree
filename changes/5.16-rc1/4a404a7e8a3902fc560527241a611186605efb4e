libbpf: Deprecate bpf_object__unload() API since v0.6

BPF objects are not reloadable after unload. Users are expected to use
bpf_object__close() to unload and free up resources in one operation.
No need to expose bpf_object__unload() as a public API, deprecate it
([0]).  Add bpf_object__unload() as an alias to internal
bpf_object_unload() and replace all bpf_object__unload() uses to avoid
compilation errors.
