hamradio: defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev

There is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below

 (USE)                       |  (FREE)
ax25_sendmsg                 |
 ax25_queue_xmit             |
  dev_queue_xmit             |
   __dev_queue_xmit          |
    __dev_xmit_skb           |
     sch_direct_xmit         | ...
      xmit_one               |
       netdev_start_xmit     | tty_ldisc_kill
        __netdev_start_xmit  |  mkiss_close
         ax_xmit             |   kfree
          ax_encaps          |
                             |

Even though there are two synchronization primitives before the kfree:
1. wait_for_completion(&ax->dead). This can prevent the race with
routines from mkiss_ioctl. However, it cannot stop the routine coming
from upper layer, i.e., the ax25_sendmsg.

2. netif_stop_queue(ax->dev). It seems that this line of code aims to
halt the transmit queue but it fails to stop the routine that already
being xmit.

This patch reorder the kfree after the unregister_netdev to avoid the
possible UAF as the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized and won't
return if there is a running routine.
