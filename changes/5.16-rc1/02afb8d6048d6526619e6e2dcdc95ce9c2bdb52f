kprobe: Simplify prepare_kprobe() by dropping redundant version

The function prepare_kprobe() is called during kprobe registration and
is responsible for ensuring any architecture related preparation for
the kprobe is done before returning.

One of two versions of prepare_kprobe() is chosen depending on the
availability of KPROBE_ON_FTRACE in the kernel configuration.

Simplify the code by dropping the version when KPROBE_ON_FTRACE is not
selected - instead relying on kprobe_ftrace() to return false when
KPROBE_ON_FTRACE is not set.

No functional change.
