ice: move ice_container_type onto ice_ring_container

Currently ice_container_type is scoped only for ice_ethtool.c. Next
commit that will split the ice_ring struct onto Rx/Tx specific ring
structs is going to also modify the type of linked list of rings that is
within ice_ring_container. Therefore, the functions that are taking the
ice_ring_container as an input argument will need to be aware of a ring
type that will be looked up.

Embed ice_container_type within ice_ring_container and initialize it
properly when allocating the q_vectors.
