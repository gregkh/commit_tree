x86/fpu: Replace KVMs home brewed FPU copy from user

Copying a user space buffer to the memory buffer is already available in
the FPU core. The copy mechanism in KVM lacks sanity checks and needs to
use cpuid() to lookup the offset of each component, while the FPU core has
this information cached.

Make the FPU core variant accessible for KVM and replace the home brewed
mechanism.
