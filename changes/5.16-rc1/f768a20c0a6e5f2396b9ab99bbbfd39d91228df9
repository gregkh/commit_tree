s390/ftrace: add FTRACE_GEN_NOP_ASM macro

FTRACE_GEN_NOP_ASM(name) can be used to generate assembly functions with
the required information added to allow tracing via kprobes/ftrace. It
adds the nop instruction which will be patched by ftrace later. If the
compiler supports -mnop-mcount it will also add an entry to the
__mcount_loc section.
