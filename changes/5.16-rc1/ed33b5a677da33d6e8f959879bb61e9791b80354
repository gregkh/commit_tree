mm: remove redundant smp_wmb()

The smp_wmb() which is in the __pte_alloc() is used to ensure all ptes
setup is visible before the pte is made visible to other CPUs by being
put into page tables.  We only need this when the pte is actually
populated, so move it to pmd_install().  __pte_alloc_kernel(),
__p4d_alloc(), __pud_alloc() and __pmd_alloc() are similar to this case.

We can also defer smp_wmb() to the place where the pmd entry is really
populated by preallocated pte.  There are two kinds of user of
preallocated pte, one is filemap & finish_fault(), another is THP.  The
former does not need another smp_wmb() because the smp_wmb() has been
done by pmd_install().  Fortunately, the latter also does not need
another smp_wmb() because there is already a smp_wmb() before populating
the new pte when the THP uses a preallocated pte to split a huge pmd.
