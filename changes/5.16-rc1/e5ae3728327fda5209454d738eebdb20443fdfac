mm: make generic arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed() do what it says

Commit 7a5da02de8d6 ("locking/lockdep: check for freed initmem in
static_obj()") added arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed() which is supposed to
report whether an object is part of already freed init memory.

For the time being, the generic version of
arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed() always reports 'false', allthough
free_initmem() is generically called on all architectures.

Therefore, change the generic version of arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed()
to check whether free_initmem() has been called.  If so, then check if a
given address falls into init memory.

To ease the use of system_state, move it out of line into its only
caller which is lockdep.c
