mtd: rawnand: hynix: Add support for H27UCG8T2ETR-BC MLC NAND

Add support for the H27UCG8T2ETR-BC MLC NAND. The NAND is used widely
in the NTC CHIP, is an MLC type NAND, and is 8GB in size. Neither
JEDEC nor ONFI detection identifies it correctly, so the ID is added
to the nand_ids.c file. Additionally, per the datasheet this NAND
appears to use the same paired pages scheme as the Toshiba
TC58TEG5DCLTA00 (dist3), so add support for that to enable use in
SLC emulation mode.

Tested on a NTC CHIP the device is able to write to a ubifs formatted
partition, and then have U-Boot (with proposed patches) boot from a
kernel located on that ubifs formatted partition.
