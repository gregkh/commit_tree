rcu: Eliminate rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs() local variable rnhqp

The rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs() function's local variable rnhqp references
the ->rcu_need_heavy_qs field in the rcu_data structure referenced by
the function parameter rdp, with a rather odd method for computing
the pointer to this field.  This commit therefore simplifies things
and saves a few lines of code by replacing each instance of rnhqp with
&rdp->need_heavy_qs.
