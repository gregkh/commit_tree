xen-blkfront: add error handling support for add_disk()

We never checked for errors on device_add_disk() as this function
returned void. Now that this is fixed, use the shiny new error
handling. The function xlvbd_alloc_gendisk() typically does the
unwinding on error on allocating the disk and creating the tag,
but since all that error handling was stuffed inside
xlvbd_alloc_gendisk() we must repeat the tag free'ing as well.

We set the info->rq to NULL to ensure blkif_free() doesn't crash
on blk_mq_stop_hw_queues() on device_add_disk() error as the queue
will be long gone by then.
