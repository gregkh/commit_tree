clk: qcom: mmcc-msm8998: Remove unnecessary fallbacks to global clocks

A previous patch removes the "xo" clock from the global namespace making
it impossible to acquire by that ".name".  The device-tree for msm8998
currently does not include an mmcc node but the dt-bindings for this
compatible already require all these clocks, and the patch introducing
this node [1] also includes them.
