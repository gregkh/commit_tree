xfs: fix incorrect decoding in xchk_btree_cur_fsbno

During review of subsequent patches, Dave and I noticed that this
function doesn't work quite right -- accessing cur->bc_ino depends on
the ROOT_IN_INODE flag, not LONG_PTRS.  Fix that and the parentheses
isssue.  While we're at it, remove the piece that accesses cur->bc_ag,
because block 0 of an AG is never part of a btree.

Note: This changes the btree scrubber tracepoints behavior -- if the
cursor has no buffer for a certain level, it will always report
NULLFSBLOCK.  It is assumed that anyone tracing the online fsck code
will also be tracing xchk_start/xchk_done or otherwise be aware of what
exactly is being scrubbed.
