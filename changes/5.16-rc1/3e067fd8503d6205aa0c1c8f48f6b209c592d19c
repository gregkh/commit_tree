KVM: x86: move guest_pv_has out of user_access section

When UBSAN is enabled, the code emitted for the call to guest_pv_has
includes a call to __ubsan_handle_load_invalid_value.  objtool
complains that this call happens with UACCESS enabled; to avoid
the warning, pull the calls to user_access_begin into both arms
of the "if" statement, after the check for guest_pv_has.
