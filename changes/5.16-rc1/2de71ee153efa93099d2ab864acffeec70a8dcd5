perf/x86/intel: Fix ICL/SPR INST_RETIRED.PREC_DIST encodings

This patch fixes the encoding for INST_RETIRED.PREC_DIST as published by Intel
(download.01.org/perfmon/) for Icelake. The official encoding
is event code 0x00 umask 0x1, a change from Skylake where it was code 0xc0
umask 0x1.

With this patch applied it is possible to run:
$ perf record -a -e cpu/event=0x00,umask=0x1/pp .....

Whereas before this would fail.

To avoid problems with tools which may use the old code, we maintain the old
encoding for Icelake.
