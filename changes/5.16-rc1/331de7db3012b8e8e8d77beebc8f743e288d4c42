drm/connector: Give connector sysfs devices there own device_type

Give connector sysfs devices there own device_type, this allows us to
check if a device passed to functions dealing with generic devices is
a drm_connector or not.

A check like this is necessary in the drm_connector_acpi_bus_match()
function added in the next patch in this series.
