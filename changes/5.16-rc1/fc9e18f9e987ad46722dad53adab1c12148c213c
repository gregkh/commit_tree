mtd: rawnand: arasan: Prevent an unsupported configuration

Under the following conditions:
* after rounding up by 4 the number of bytes to transfer (this is
  related to the controller's internal constraints),
* if this (rounded) amount of data is situated beyond the end of the
  device,
* and only in NV-DDR mode,
the Arasan NAND controller timeouts.

This currently can happen in a particular helper used when picking
software ECC algorithms. Let's prevent this situation by refusing to use
the NV-DDR interface with software engines.
