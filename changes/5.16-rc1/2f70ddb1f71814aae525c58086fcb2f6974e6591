EFI: Introduce the new AMD Memory Encryption GUID.

Introduce a new AMD Memory Encryption GUID which is currently
used for defining a new UEFI environment variable which indicates
UEFI/OVMF support for the SEV live migration feature. This variable
is setup when UEFI/OVMF detects host/hypervisor support for SEV
live migration and later this variable is read by the kernel using
EFI runtime services to verify if OVMF supports the live migration
feature.
