btrfs: zoned: finish fully written block group

If we have written to the zone capacity, the device automatically
deactivates the zone. Sync up block group side (the active BG list and
zone_is_active flag) with it.

We need to do it both on data BGs and metadata BGs. On data side, we add a
hook to btrfs_finish_ordered_io(). On metadata side, we use
end_extent_buffer_writeback().

To reduce excess lookup of a block group, we mark the last extent buffer in
a block group with EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONE_FINISH flag. This cannot be done for
data (ordered_extent), because the address may change due to
REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND.
