sched: Improve wake_up_all_idle_cpus() take #2

As reported by syzbot and experienced by Pavel, using cpus_read_lock()
in wake_up_all_idle_cpus() generates lock inversion (against mmap_sem
and possibly others).

Instead, shrink the preempt disable region by iterating all CPUs and
checking the online status for each individual CPU while having
preemption disabled.
