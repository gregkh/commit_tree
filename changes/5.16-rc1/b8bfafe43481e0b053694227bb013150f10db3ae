selftests: mlxsw: Add helpers for skipping selftests

A number of mlxsw-specific selftests currently detect whether they are run
on a compatible machine, and bail out silently when not. These tests are
however done in a somewhat impenetrable manner by directly comparing PCI
IDs against a blacklist or a whitelist, and bailing out silently if the
machine is not compatible.

Instead, add a helper, mlxsw_only_on_spectrum(), which allows specifying
the supported machines in a human-readable manner. If the current machine
is incompatible, the helper emits a SKIP message and returns an error code,
based on which the caller can gracefully bail out in a suitable way. This
allows a more readable conditions such as:

	mlxsw_only_on_spectrum 2+ || return

Convert all existing open-coded guards to the new helper. Also add two new
guards to do_mark_test() and do_drop_test(), which are supported only on
Spectrum-2+, but the corresponding check was not there.
