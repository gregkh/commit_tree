hardening: Avoid harmless Clang option under CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO

Currently under Clang, CC_HAS_AUTO_VAR_INIT_ZERO requires an extra
-enable flag compared to CC_HAS_AUTO_VAR_INIT_PATTERN. GCC 12[1] will
not, and will happily ignore the Clang-specific flag. However, its
presence on the command-line is both cumbersome and confusing. Due to
GCC's tolerant behavior, though, we can continue to use a single Kconfig
cc-option test for the feature on both compilers, but then drop the
Clang-specific option in the Makefile.

In other words, this patch does not change anything other than making the
compiler command line shorter once GCC supports -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero.
