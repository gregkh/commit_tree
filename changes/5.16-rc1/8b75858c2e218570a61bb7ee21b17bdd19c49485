iwlwifi: mvm: set BT-coex high priority for 802.1X/4-way-HS

Set BT coex high priority during the 802.1X handshake to avoid
issues where BT is active enough to kill all the big negotiation
frames that we may need to send (e.g. with a large certificate),
leading to the connection not being established correctly. Give
WiFi priority over BT during this short but critical phase.
