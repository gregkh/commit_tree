nbd: don't handle response without a corresponding request message

While handling a response message from server, nbd_read_stat() will
try to get request by tag, and then complete the request. However,
this is problematic if nbd haven't sent a corresponding request
message:

t1                      t2
                        submit_bio
                         nbd_queue_rq
                          blk_mq_start_request
recv_work
 nbd_read_stat
  blk_mq_tag_to_rq
 blk_mq_complete_request
                          nbd_send_cmd

Thus add a new cmd flag 'NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT', it will be set in
nbd_send_cmd() and checked in nbd_read_stat().

Noted that this patch can't fix that blk_mq_tag_to_rq() might
return a freed request, and this will be fixed in following
patches.
