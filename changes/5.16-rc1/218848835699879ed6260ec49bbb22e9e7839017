media: s5p-jpeg: rename JPEG marker constants to prevent build warnings

The use of a macro named 'RST' conflicts with one of the same name
in arch/mips/include/asm/mach-rc32434/rb.h. This causes build
warnings on some MIPS builds.

Change the names of the JPEG marker constants to be in their own
namespace to fix these build warnings and to prevent other similar
problems in the future.

Fixes these build warnings:

Also update the kernel-doc so that the word "marker" is not
repeated.
