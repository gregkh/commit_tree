can: netlink: add can_priv::do_get_auto_tdcv() to retrieve tdcv from device

Some CAN device can measure the TDCV (Transmission Delay Compensation
Value) automatically for each transmitted CAN frames.

A callback function do_get_auto_tdcv() is added to retrieve that
value. This function is used only if CAN_CTRLMODE_TDC_AUTO is enabled
(if CAN_CTRLMODE_TDC_MANUAL is selected, the TDCV value is provided by
the user).

If the device does not support reporting of TDCV, do_get_auto_tdcv()
should be set to NULL and TDCV will not be reported by the netlink
interface.

On success, do_get_auto_tdcv() shall return 0. If the value can not be
measured by the device, for example because network is down or because
no frames were transmitted yet, can_priv::do_get_auto_tdcv() shall
return a negative error code (e.g. -EINVAL) to signify that the value
is not yet available. In such cases, TDCV is not reported by the
netlink interface.
