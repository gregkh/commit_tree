bpf: Do not invoke the XDP dispatcher for PROG_RUN with single repeat

We have a unit test that invokes an XDP program with 1m different
inputs, aka 1m BPF_PROG_RUN syscalls. We run this test concurrently
with slight variations in how we generated the input.

Since commit f23c4b3924d2 ("bpf: Start using the BPF dispatcher in BPF_TEST_RUN")
the unit test has slowed down significantly. Digging deeper reveals that
the concurrent tests are serialised in the kernel on the XDP dispatcher.
This is a global resource that is protected by a mutex, on which we contend.

Fix this by not calling into the XDP dispatcher if we only want to perform
a single run of the BPF program.
