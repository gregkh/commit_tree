selftests/bpf: Stop using bpf_program__load

bpf_program__load is not supposed to be used directly. Replace it with
bpf_object__ APIs for the reference_tracking prog_test, which is the
last offender in bpf selftests.

Some additional complexity is added for this test, namely the use of one
bpf_object to iterate through progs, while a second bpf_object is
created and opened/closed to test actual loading of progs. This is
because the test was doing bpf_program__load then __unload to test
loading of individual progs and same semantics with
bpf_object__load/__unload result in failure to load an __unload-ed obj.
