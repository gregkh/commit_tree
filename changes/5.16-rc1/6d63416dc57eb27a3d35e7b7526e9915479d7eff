io_uring: optimise plugging

Plugging is only needed with requests that also need a file, so hide
plugging under a ->needs_file check. Also, place ->needs_file and ->plug
bits into the same byte of io_op_defs, it may matter for compilers, e.g.
only with the change a tested one decided to optimise two memory testb
into a more with two register testb.
