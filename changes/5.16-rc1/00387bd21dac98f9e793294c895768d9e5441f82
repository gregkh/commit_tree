bcache: use bvec_kmap_local in bch_data_verify

Using local kmaps slightly reduces the chances to stray writes, and
the bvec interface cleans up the code a little bit.

Also switch from page_address to bvec_kmap_local for cbv to be on the
safe side and to avoid pointlessly poking into bvec internals.
