btrfs: use num_device to check for the last surviving seed device

For both sprout and seed fsids,
 btrfs_fs_devices::num_devices provides device count including missing
 btrfs_fs_devices::open_devices provides device count excluding missing

We create a dummy struct btrfs_device for the missing device, so
num_devices != open_devices when there is a missing device.

In btrfs_rm_devices() we wrongly check for %cur_devices->open_devices
before freeing the seed fs_devices. Instead we should check for
%cur_devices->num_devices.
