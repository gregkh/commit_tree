drm/amd/pm: Correct DPMS disable IP version check

Previously there was a check based on chip # for chips that aligned to
>=CHIP_NAVI10 to have RLC stopped as part of DPMS check.  This was because
of gfxclk being controlled by RLC in the newer designs.

As part of IP version checking though, this got changed to match IP
version for SMU.  Because Renoir designs also include smu11 that meant
that even GFX9 started to stop RLC earlier.

Adjust to match GFX IP version instead of SMU IP version to restore the
previous behavior.
