mm/filemap.c: remove bogus VM_BUG_ON

It is not safe to check page->index without holding the page lock.  It
can be changed if the page is moved between the swap cache and the page
cache for a shmem file, for example.  There is a VM_BUG_ON below which
checks page->index is correct after taking the page lock.
