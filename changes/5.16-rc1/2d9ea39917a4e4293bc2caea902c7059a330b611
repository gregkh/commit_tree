ALSA: memalloc: Convert x86 SG-buffer handling with non-contiguous type

We've had an x86-specific SG-buffer handling code, but now it can be
merged gracefully with the standard non-contiguous DMA pages.

After the migration, SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DMA_SG becomes identical with
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_NONCONTIG on x86, while others still fall back to
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV.

The remaining problem is about the SG-buffer with WC pages: the DMA
core stuff on x86 doesn't treat it well, so we still need some special
handling to manipulate the page attribute manually.  The mmap handler
for SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_SG_WC still returns -ENOENT intentionally for
the fallback to the default handler.
