stacktrace: move filter_irq_stacks() to kernel/stacktrace.c

filter_irq_stacks() has little to do with the stackdepot implementation,
except that it is usually used by users (such as KASAN) of stackdepot to
reduce the stack trace.

However, filter_irq_stacks() itself is not useful without a stack trace
as obtained by stack_trace_save() and friends.

Therefore, move filter_irq_stacks() to kernel/stacktrace.c, so that new
users of filter_irq_stacks() do not have to start depending on
STACKDEPOT only for filter_irq_stacks().
