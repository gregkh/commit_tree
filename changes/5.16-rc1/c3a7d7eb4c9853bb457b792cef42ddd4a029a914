ath11k: add 6 GHz params in peer assoc command

Currently A-MPDU aggregation parameters are not being configured
during peer association for 6 GHz band. Hence, extract these
parameters from station's capabilities received in association
request and send to firmware. Without this, A-MPDU aggregation
is not happening in 6 GHz band.
