mm/memory_hotplug: handle memblock_add_node() failures in add_memory_resource()

Patch series "mm/memory_hotplug: full support for add_memory_driver_managed() with CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK", v2.

Architectures that require CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK=y, such as arm64,
don't cleanly support add_memory_driver_managed() yet.  Most
prominently, kexec_file can still end up placing kexec images on such
driver-managed memory, resulting in undesired behavior, for example,
having kexec images located on memory not part of the firmware-provided
memory map.

Teaching kexec to not place images on driver-managed memory is
especially relevant for virtio-mem.  Details can be found in commit
7b7b27214bba ("mm/memory_hotplug: introduce
add_memory_driver_managed()").

Extend memblock with a new flag and set it from memory hotplug code when
applicable.  This is required to fully support virtio-mem on arm64,
making also kexec_file behave like on x86-64.

This patch (of 2):

If memblock_add_node() fails, we're most probably running out of memory.
While this is unlikely to happen, it can happen and having memory added
without a memblock can be problematic for architectures that use
memblock to detect valid memory.  Let's fail in a nice way instead of
silently ignoring the error.
