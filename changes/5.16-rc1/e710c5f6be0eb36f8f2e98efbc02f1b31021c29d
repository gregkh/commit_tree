KVM: x86/mmu: Pass the memslot around via struct kvm_page_fault

The memslot for the faulting gfn is used throughout the page fault
handling code, so capture it in kvm_page_fault as soon as we know the
gfn and use it in the page fault handling code that has direct access
to the kvm_page_fault struct.  Replace various tests using is_noslot_pfn
with more direct tests on fault->slot being NULL.

This, in combination with the subsequent patch, improves "Populate
memory time" in dirty_log_perf_test by 5% when using the legacy MMU.
There is no discerable improvement to the performance of the TDP MMU.

No functional change intended.
