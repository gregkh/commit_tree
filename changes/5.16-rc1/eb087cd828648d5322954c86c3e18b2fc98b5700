ice: propagate xdp_ring onto rx_ring

With rings being split, it is now convenient to introduce a pointer to
XDP ring within the Rx ring. For XDP_TX workloads this means that
xdp_rings array access will be skipped, which was executed per each
processed frame.

Also, read the XDP prog once per NAPI and if prog is present, set up the
local xdp_ring pointer. Reading prog a single time was discussed in [1]
with some concern raised by Toke around dispatcher handling and having
the need for going through the RCU grace period in the ndo_bpf driver
callback, but ice currently is torning down NAPI instances regardless of
the prog presence on VSI.

Although the pointer to XDP ring introduced to Rx ring makes things a
lot slimmer/simpler, I still feel that single prog read per NAPI
lifetime is beneficial.

Further patch that will introduce the fallback path will also get a
profit from that as xdp_ring pointer will be set during the XDP rings
setup.
