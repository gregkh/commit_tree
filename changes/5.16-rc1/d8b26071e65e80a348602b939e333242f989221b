NFSD: simplify struct nfsfh

Most of the fields in 'struct knfsd_fh' are 2 levels deep (a union and a
struct) and are accessed using macros like:

 #define fh_FOO fh_base.fh_new.fb_FOO

This patch makes the union and struct anonymous, so that "fh_FOO" can be
a name directly within 'struct knfsd_fh' and the #defines aren't needed.

The file handle as a whole is sometimes accessed as "fh_base" or
"fh_base.fh_pad", neither of which are particularly helpful names.
As the struct holding the filehandle is now anonymous, we
cannot use the name of that, so we union it with 'fh_raw' and use that
where the raw filehandle is needed.  fh_raw also ensure the structure is
large enough for the largest possible filehandle.

fh_raw is a 'char' array, removing any need to cast it for memcpy etc.

SVCFH_fmt() is simplified using the "%ph" printk format.  This
changes the appearance of filehandles in dprintk() debugging, making
them a little more precise.
