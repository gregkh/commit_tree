x86/extable: Remove EX_TYPE_FAULT from MCE safe fixups

Now that the MC safe copy and FPU have been converted to use the MCE safe
fixup types remove EX_TYPE_FAULT from the list of types which MCE considers
to be safe to be recovered in kernel.

This removes the SGX exception handling of ENCLS from the #MC safe
handling, but according to the SGX wizards the current SGX implementations
cannot survive #MC on ENCLS:

The code relies on the trap number being stored if ENCLS raised an
exception. That's still working, but it does no longer trick the MCE code
into assuming that #MC is handled correctly for ENCLS.
