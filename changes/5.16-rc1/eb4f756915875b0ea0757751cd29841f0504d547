ARM: 9120/1: Revert "amba: make use of -1 IRQs warn"

After commit 77a7300abad7 ("of/irq: Get rid of NO_IRQ usage"),
no irq case has been removed, irq_of_parse_and_map() will return
0 in all cases when get error from parse and map an interrupt into
linux virq space.

amba_device_register() is only used on no-DT initialization, see
  s3c64xx_pl080_init()		arch/arm/mach-s3c/pl080.c
  ep93xx_init_devices()		arch/arm/mach-ep93xx/core.c

They won't set -1 to irq[0], so no need the warn.

This reverts commit 2eac58d5026e4ec8b17ff8b62877fea9e1d2f1b3.
