block: add a struct io_comp_batch argument to fops->iopoll()

struct io_comp_batch contains a list head and a completion handler, which
will allow completions to more effciently completed batches of IO.

For now, no functional changes in this patch, we just define the
io_comp_batch structure and add the argument to the file_operations iopoll
handler.
