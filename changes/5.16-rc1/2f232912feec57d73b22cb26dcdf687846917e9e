RDMA/rtrs: Use sysfs_emit instead of s*printf function for sysfs show

sysfs_emit function was added to be aware of the PAGE_SIZE maximum of the
temporary buffer used for outputting sysfs content, so there is no
possible overruns. So replace the uses of any s*printf functions for the
sysfs show functions with sysfs_emit.
