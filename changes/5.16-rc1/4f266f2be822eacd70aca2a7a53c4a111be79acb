block: skip elevator fields init for non-elv queue

Don't init rq->hash and rq->rb_node in blk_mq_rq_ctx_init() if there is
no elevator. Also, move some other initialisers that imply barriers to
the end, so the compiler is free to rearrange and optimise other the
rest of them.

note: fold in a change from Jens leaving queue_list unconditional, as
it might lead to problems otherwise.
