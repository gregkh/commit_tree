auxdisplay: ht16k33: Add LED support

Instantiate a single LED based on the "led" subnode in DT.
This allows the user to control display brightness and blinking (backed
by hardware support) through the LED class API and triggers, and exposes
the display color.  The LED will be named
"auxdisplay:<color>:<function>".

When running in dot-matrix mode and if no "led" subnode is found, the
driver falls back to the traditional backlight mode, to preserve
backwards compatibility.
