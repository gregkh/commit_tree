selftests/bpf: Refactor btf_write selftest to reuse BTF generation logic

Next patch will need to reuse BTF generation logic, which tests every
supported BTF kind, for testing btf__add_btf() APIs. So restructure
existing selftests and make it as a single subtest that uses bulk
VALIDATE_RAW_BTF() macro for raw BTF dump checking.
