scsi: ufs: core: Remove three superfluous casts

Casting an int explicitly to u16 when passed as an argument to a function
is not necessary.

Since prd_table and ucd_prdt_ptr both have type struct ufshcd_sg_entry *,
remove the casts from assignments of these two to each other.

This patch does not change any functionality.
