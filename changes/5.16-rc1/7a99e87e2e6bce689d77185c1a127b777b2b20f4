dt-bindings: soc: smem: Make indirection optional

In the olden days the Qualcomm shared memory (SMEM) region consisted of
multiple chunks of memory, so SMEM was described as a standalone node
with references to its various memory regions.

But practically all modern Qualcomm platforms has a single reserved memory
region used for SMEM. So rather than having to use two nodes to describe
the one SMEM region, update the binding to allow the reserved-memory
region alone to describe SMEM.

The olden format is preserved as valid, as this is widely used already.
