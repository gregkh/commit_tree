ASoC: cs42l42: free_irq() before powering-down on probe() fail

Relying on devm to free the irq handler on probe failure leaves a
small window of opportunity for an interrupt to become pending and
then the handler to run after the chip has been reset and powered
off.

For safety cs42l42_probe() should free the irq in the error path.
As the irq is now disabled by the driver in probe() and remove()
there is no point allocating it as a devres-managed item, so
convert to plain non-devres.
