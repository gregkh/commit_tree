PCI: Export pci_dev_lock()

Commit e3a9b1212b9d ("PCI: Export pci_dev_trylock() and pci_dev_unlock()")
already exported pci_dev_trylock()/pci_dev_unlock() however in some
circumstances such as during error recovery it makes sense to block
waiting to get full access to the device so also export pci_dev_lock().
