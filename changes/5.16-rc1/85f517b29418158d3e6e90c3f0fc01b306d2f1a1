KVM: s390: Fix handle_sske page fault handling

If handle_sske cannot set the storage key, because there is no
page table entry or no present large page entry, it calls
fixup_user_fault.
However, currently, if the call succeeds, handle_sske returns
-EAGAIN, without having set the storage key.
Instead, retry by continue'ing the loop without incrementing the
address.
The same issue in handle_pfmf was fixed by
a11bdb1a6b78 ("KVM: s390: Fix pfmf and conditional skey emulation").
