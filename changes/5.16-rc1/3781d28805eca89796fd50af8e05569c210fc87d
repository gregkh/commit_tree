mmc: sdhci-omap: Parse legacy ti,non-removable property

We need to support the legacy ti,non-removable property too. Let's warn
about the legacy property and mark the device as non-removable.

Naturally all the mainline kernel devicetree files will get updated to use
the standard non-removable property with the sdhci-omap conversion. But we
also have folks updating their kernels with custom devicetree files that
we need to consider.
