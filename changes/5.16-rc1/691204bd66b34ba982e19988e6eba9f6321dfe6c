can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_irq(): add missing can_rx_offload_threaded_irq_finish() in case of bus off

The function can_rx_offload_threaded_irq_finish() is needed to trigger
the NAPI thread to deliver read CAN frames to the networking stack.

This patch adds the missing call to can_rx_offload_threaded_irq_finish()
in case of a bus off, before leaving the interrupt handler to avoid
packet starvation.
