mm/workingset: Convert workingset_activation to take a folio

This function already assumed it was being passed a head page.  No real
change here, except that thp_nr_pages() compiles away on kernels with
THP compiled out while folio_nr_pages() is always present.  Also convert
page_memcg_rcu() to folio_memcg_rcu().
