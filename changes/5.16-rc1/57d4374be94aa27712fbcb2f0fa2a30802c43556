audit: rename struct node to struct audit_node to prevent future name collisions

Future work in the powerpc code results in a name collision with the
identified "node" as struct node defined in kernel/audit_tree.c
conflicts with struct node defined in include/linux/node.h (below).
This patch takes the proactive route and renames the audit code's
struct node to audit_node.
