mfd: ti_am335x_tscadc: Use driver data

So far every sub-cell parameter in this driver was hardcoded: cell name,
cell compatible, specific clock name and desired clock frequency.

As we are about to introduce support for ADC1/magnetic reader, we need a
bit of flexibility. Let's add a driver data structure which will contain
these information.
