cpufreq: Introducing CPUFREQ_RELATION_E

This newly introduced flag can be applied by a governor to a CPUFreq
relation, when looking for a frequency within the policy table. The
resolution would then only walk through efficient frequencies.

Even with the flag set, the policy max limit will still be honoured. If no
efficient frequencies can be found within the limits of the policy, an
inefficient one would be returned.
