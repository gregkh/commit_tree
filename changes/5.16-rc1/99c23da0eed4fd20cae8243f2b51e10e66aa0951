Bluetooth: sco: Fix lock_sock() blockage by memcpy_from_msg()

The sco_send_frame() also takes lock_sock() during memcpy_from_msg()
call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.

Just like the similar fix for hci_sock_sendmsg() in commit
92c685dc5de0 ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
the  memcpy_from_msg() out of lock_sock() for addressing the hang.

This should be the last piece for fixing CVE-2021-3640 after a few
already queued fixes.
