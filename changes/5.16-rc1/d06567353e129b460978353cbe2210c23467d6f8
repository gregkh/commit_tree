KVM: VMX: Drop explicit zeroing of MSR guest values at vCPU creation

Don't zero out user return and nested MSRs during vCPU creation, and
instead rely on vcpu_vmx being zero-allocated.  Explicitly zeroing MSRs
is not wrong, and is in fact necessary if KVM ever emulates vCPU RESET
outside of vCPU creation, but zeroing only a subset of MSRs is confusing.

Poking directly into KVM's backing is also undesirable in that it doesn't
scale and is error prone.  Ideally KVM would have a common RESET path for
all MSRs, e.g. by expanding kvm_set_msr(), which would obviate the need
for this out-of-bad code (to support standalone RESET).

No functional change intended.
