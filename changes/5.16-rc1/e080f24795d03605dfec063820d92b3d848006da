ABI: sysfs-driver-ufs: Add another What for platform drivers

The current what expressions:
	What:          /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ufshcd/*/...

Doesn't actually match what (some?) platform drivers actually
export. For instance, drivers/scsi/ufs/ufs-hisi.c actually
creates the sysfs struct for ufshcd inside this directory:

	/sys/devices/platform/soc/ff3c0000.ufs

Which has those aliases:

	/sys/devices/virtual/devlink/platform:fff35000.crg_ctrl--platform:ff3c0000.ufs/consumer/
	/sys/bus/platform/drivers/ufshcd-hisi/ff3c0000.ufs/
	/sys/bus/platform/devices/soc/ff3c0000.ufs/
	/sys/bus/platform/devices/ff3c0000.ufs/

So, add another What: for such files that will match the
device ufs entries, e. g.:

	What:          /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.ufs/
