gpio: Allow per-parent interrupt data

The core gpiolib code is able to deal with multiple interrupt parents
for a single gpio irqchip. It however only allows a single piece
of data to be conveyed to all flow handlers (either the gpio_chip
or some other, driver-specific data).

This means that drivers have to go through some interesting dance
to find the correct context, something that isn't great in interrupt
context (see aebdc8abc9db86e2bd33070fc2f961012fff74b4 for a prime
example).

Instead, offer an optional way for a pinctrl/gpio driver to provide
an array of pointers which gets used to provide the correct context
to the flow handler.
