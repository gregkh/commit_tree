powercap/drivers/dtpm: Use container_of instead of a private data field

The dtpm framework provides an API to allocate a dtpm node. However
when a backend dtpm driver needs to allocate a dtpm node it must
define its own structure and store the pointer of this structure in
the private field of the dtpm structure.

It is more elegant to use the container_of macro and add the dtpm
structure inside the dtpm backend specific structure. The code will be
able to deal properly with the dtpm structure as a generic entity,
making all this even more self-encapsulated.

The dtpm_alloc() function does no longer make sense as the dtpm
structure will be allocated when allocating the device specific dtpm
structure. The dtpm_init() is provided instead.
