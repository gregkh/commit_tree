fsnotify: clarify contract for create event hooks

Clarify argument names and contract for fsnotify_create() and
fsnotify_mkdir() to reflect the anomaly of kernfs, which leaves dentries
negavite after mkdir/create.

Remove the WARN_ON(!inode) in audit code that were added by the Fixes
commit under the wrong assumption that dentries cannot be negative after
mkdir/create.

Fixes: aa93bdc5500c ("fsnotify: use helpers to access data by data_type")
