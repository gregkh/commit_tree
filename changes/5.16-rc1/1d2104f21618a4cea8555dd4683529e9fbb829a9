regulator: dt-bindings: maxim,max8997: convert to dtschema

Convert the Maxim MAX8997 PMIC bindings to DT schema format.  Extend the
examples with additional one copied from kernel's exynos4210-origen.dts.
Also the binding descriptions are copied from old file, so license
entire work under GPL-2.0.

This also adds previously undocumented 32 kHz clock output modelled as
regulators.
