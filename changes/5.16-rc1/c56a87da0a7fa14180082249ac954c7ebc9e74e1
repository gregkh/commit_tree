KVM: arm64: vgic-v2: Check cpu interface region is not above the VM IPA size

Verify that the GICv2 CPU interface does not extend beyond the
VM-specified IPA range (phys_size).

  base + size > phys_size AND base < phys_size

Add the missing check into kvm_vgic_addr() which is called when setting
the region. This patch also enables some superfluous checks for the
distributor (vgic_check_ioaddr was enough as alignment == size for the
distributors).
