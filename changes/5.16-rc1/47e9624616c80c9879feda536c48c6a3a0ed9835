block: remove support for cryptoloop and the xor transfer

Support for cyrptoloop has been officially marked broken and deprecated
in favor of dm-crypt (which supports the same broken algorithms if
needed) in Linux 2.6.4 (released in March 2004), and support for it has
been entirely removed from losetup in util-linux 2.23 (released in April
2013).  The XOR transfer has never been more than a toy to demonstrate
the transfer in the bad old times of crypto export restrictions.
Remove them as they have some nasty interactions with loop device life
times due to the iteration over all loop devices in
loop_unregister_transfer.
