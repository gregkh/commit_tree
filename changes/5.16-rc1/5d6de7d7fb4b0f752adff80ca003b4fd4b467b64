kprobes: Use helper to parse boolean input from userspace

The "enabled" file provides a debugfs interface to arm / disarm
kprobes in the kernel. In order to parse the buffer containing the
values written from userspace, the callback manually parses the user
input to convert it to a boolean value.

As taking a string value from userspace and converting it to boolean
is a common operation, a helper kstrtobool_from_user() is already
available in the kernel. Update the callback to use the common helper
to parse the write buffer from userspace.
