mm/rmap: Add folio_mkclean()

Transform page_mkclean() into folio_mkclean() and add a page_mkclean()
wrapper around folio_mkclean().

folio_mkclean is 15 bytes smaller than page_mkclean, but the kernel
is enlarged by 33 bytes due to inlining page_folio() into each caller.
This will go away once the callers are converted to use folio_mkclean().
