mm/filemap: Add folio_lock_killable()

This is like lock_page_killable() but for use by callers who
know they have a folio.  Convert __lock_page_killable() to be
__folio_lock_killable().  This saves one call to compound_head() per
contended call to lock_page_killable().

__folio_lock_killable() is 19 bytes smaller than __lock_page_killable()
was.  filemap_fault() shrinks by 74 bytes and __lock_page_or_retry()
shrinks by 71 bytes.  That's a total of 164 bytes of text saved.
