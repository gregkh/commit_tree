rtc: class: don't call cdev_device_del() when cdev_device_add() failed

I got a null-ptr-deref report when doing fault injection test:

general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000022: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000110-0x0000000000000117]
RIP: 0010:device_del+0x132/0xdc0
Call Trace:
 cdev_device_del+0x1a/0x80
 devm_rtc_unregister_device+0x37/0x80
 release_nodes+0xc3/0x3b0

If cdev_device_add() fails, 'dev->p' is not set, it causes
null-ptr-deref when calling cdev_device_del(). Registering
character device is optional, we don't return error code
here, so introduce a new flag 'RTC_NO_CDEV' to indicate
if it has character device, cdev_device_del() is called
when this bit is not set.
