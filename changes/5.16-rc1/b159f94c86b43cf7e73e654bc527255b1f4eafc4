s390/gmap: don't unconditionally call pte_unmap_unlock() in __gmap_zap()

... otherwise we will try unlocking a spinlock that was never locked via a
garbage pointer.

At the time we reach this code path, we usually successfully looked up
a PGSTE already; however, evil user space could have manipulated the VMA
layout in the meantime and triggered removal of the page table.
