drm/virtio: implement context init: handle VIRTGPU_CONTEXT_PARAM_POLL_RINGS_MASK

For the Sommelier guest Wayland proxy, it's desirable for the
DRM fd to be pollable in response to an host compositor event.
This can also be used by the 3D driver to poll events on a CPU
timeline.

This enables the DRM fd associated with a particular 3D context
to be polled independent of KMS events.  The parameter
VIRTGPU_CONTEXT_PARAM_POLL_RINGS_MASK specifies the pollable
rings.
