erofs: introduce the secondary compression head

Previously, for each HEAD lcluster, it can be either HEAD or PLAIN
lcluster to indicate whether the whole pcluster is compressed or not.

In this patch, a new HEAD2 head type is introduced to specify another
compression algorithm other than the primary algorithm for each
compressed file, which can be used for upcoming LZMA compression and
LZ4 range dictionary compression for various data patterns.

It has been stayed in the EROFS roadmap for years. Complete it now!
