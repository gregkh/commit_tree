iwlwifi: mvm: d3: use internal data representation

Trying to convert from one firmware data representation to the
next version is getting tedious and error-prone, and doesn't
lend itself well to new APIs being added. Additionally, the
version 11 of the API as defined in the driver doesn't even
exist in the firmware.

Instead of converting to a newer firmware version of the data,
convert to an internal representation. This takes a bit more
space because the TKIP/AES counters etc. must be kept twice,
their representation is different and we don't know which of
the ones it is until later, but this is just a temporary use
of memory, and the code is clearer this way.
