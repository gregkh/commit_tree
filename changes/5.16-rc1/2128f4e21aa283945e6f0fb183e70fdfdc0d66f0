virtio-mem: disallow mapping virtio-mem memory via /dev/mem

We don't want user space to be able to map virtio-mem device memory
directly (e.g., via /dev/mem) in order to have guarantees that in a sane
setup we'll never accidentially access unplugged memory within the
device-managed region of a virtio-mem device, just as required by the
virtio-spec.

As soon as the virtio-mem driver is loaded, the device region is visible
in /proc/iomem via the parent device region.  From that point on user
space is aware of the device region and we want to disallow mapping
anything inside that region (where we will dynamically (un)plug memory)
until the driver has been unloaded cleanly and e.g., another driver might
take over.

By creating our parent IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM resource with
IORESOURCE_EXCLUSIVE, we will disallow any /dev/mem access to our device
region until the driver was unloaded cleanly and removed the parent
region.  This will work even though only some memory blocks are actually
currently added to Linux and appear as busy in the resource tree.

So access to the region from user space is only possible
a) if we don't load the virtio-mem driver.
b) after unloading the virtio-mem driver cleanly.

Don't build virtio-mem if access to /dev/mem cannot be restricticted -- if
we have CONFIG_DEVMEM=y but CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM is not set.
