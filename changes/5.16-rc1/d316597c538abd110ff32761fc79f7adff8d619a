ASoC: nau8824: Fix NAU8824_JACK_LOGIC define

The NAU8824_JACK_LOGIC define was wrong, for active high jack-detect
to work bit 1 needs to be set, rather then bit 0.

The correct bit was found in the Android kernel source dump for
a Cyberbook T116 tablet; and this was also tested on that same tablet.
