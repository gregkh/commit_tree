arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Fix Secondary MI2S bit clock

At the moment, playing audio on Secondary MI2S will just end up getting
stuck, without actually playing any audio. This happens because the wrong
bit clock is configured when playing audio on Secondary MI2S.

The PRI_I2S_CLK (better name: SPKR_I2S_CLK) is used by the SPKR audio mux
block that provides both Primary and Secondary MI2S.

The SEC_I2S_CLK (better name: MIC_I2S_CLK) is used by the MIC audio mux
block that provides Tertiary MI2S. Quaternary MI2S is also part of the
MIC audio mux but has its own clock (AUX_I2S_CLK).

This means that (quite confusingly) the SEC_I2S_CLK is not actually
used for Secondary MI2S as the name would suggest. Secondary MI2S
needs to have the same clock as Primary MI2S configured.

Fix the clock list for the lpass node in the device tree and add
a comment to clarify this confusing naming. With these changes,
audio can be played correctly on Secondary MI2S.
