x86/fpu: Do not inherit FPU context for kernel and IO worker threads

There is no reason why kernel and IO worker threads need a full clone of
the parent's FPU state. Both are kernel threads which are not supposed to
use FPU. So copying a large state or doing XSAVE() is pointless. Just clean
out the minimally required state for those tasks.
