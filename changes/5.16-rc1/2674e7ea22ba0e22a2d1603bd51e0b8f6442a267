net: usb: don't write directly to netdev->dev_addr

Commit 406f42fa0d3c ("net-next: When a bond have a massive amount
of VLANs...") introduced a rbtree for faster Ethernet address look
up. To maintain netdev->dev_addr in this tree we need to make all
the writes to it got through appropriate helpers.

Manually fix all net/usb drivers without separate maintainers.

v2: catc does DMA to the buffer, leave the conversion to Oliver
