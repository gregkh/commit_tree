x86/fpu: Provide struct fpu_config

Provide a struct to store information about the maximum supported and the
default feature set and buffer sizes for both user and kernel space.

This allows quick retrieval of this information for the upcoming support
for dynamically enabled features.

 [ bp: Add vertical spacing between the struct members. ]
