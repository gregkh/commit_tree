mptcp: increase default max additional subflows to 2

The current default does not allowing additional subflows, mostly
as a safety restriction to avoid uncontrolled resource consumption
on busy servers.

Still the system admin and/or the application have to opt-in to
MPTCP explicitly. After that, they need to change (increase) the
default maximum number of additional subflows.

Let set that to reasonable default, and make end-users life easier.

Additionally we need to update some self-tests accordingly.
