Revert "ext4: enforce buffer head state assertion in ext4_da_map_blocks"

This reverts commit 948ca5f30e1df0c11eb5b0f410b9ceb97fa77ad9.

Two crash reports from users running variations on 5.15-rc4 kernels
suggest that it is premature to enforce the state assertion in the
original commit.  Both crashes were triggered by BUG calls in that
code, indicating that under some rare circumstance the buffer head
state did not match a delayed allocated block at the time the
block was written out.  No reproducer is available.  Resolving this
problem will require more time than remains in the current release
cycle, so reverting the original patch for the time being is necessary
to avoid any instability it may cause.
