staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of usb_write_port_cancel()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_write_port_cancel() and usb_write_port_cancel()
and embed their code into the caller (i.e., rtw_write_port_cancel()).

_rtw_write_port_cancel() is a mere redefinition of rtw_write_port_cancel()
and it is unneeded. usb_write_port_cancel() was the only functions
assigned to the (*_usb_write_port_cancel) pointer, so we can simply remove
it and make a direct call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
