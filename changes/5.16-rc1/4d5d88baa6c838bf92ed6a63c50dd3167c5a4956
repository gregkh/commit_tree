coresight: tmc: Configure AXI write burst size

The current driver sets the write burst size initiated by TMC-ETR on
AXI bus to a fixed value of 16. Make this configurable by reading the
value specified in fwnode. If not specified, then default to 16.

Introduced a "max_burst_size" variable in tmc_drvdata structure to
facilitate this change.
