staging: r8188eu: remove rtw_hal_disable_interrupt function

Remove rtw_hal_disable_interrupt from hal/hal_intf.c, and remove its
declaration from include/hal_intf.h as well. This is just a wrapper
function that calls the function pointer disable_interrupt in struct
hal_ops if it is set, which it never is. In addition, this wrapper
function is unused anyway.
