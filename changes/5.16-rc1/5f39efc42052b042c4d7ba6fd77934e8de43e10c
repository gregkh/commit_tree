KVM: arm64: Handle protected guests at 32 bits

Protected KVM does not support protected AArch32 guests. However,
it is possible for the guest to force run AArch32, potentially
causing problems. Add an extra check so that if the hypervisor
catches the guest doing that, it can prevent the guest from
running again by resetting vcpu->arch.target and returning
ARM_EXCEPTION_IL.

If this were to happen, The VMM can try and fix it by re-
initializing the vcpu with KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT, however, this is
likely not possible for protected VMs.

AArch32 systems")
