arm64: tegra: Extend APE audio support on Jetson platforms

Extend APE audio support by adding more audio components such as SFC,
MVC, AMX, ADX and Mixer. These components can be plugged into an audio
path and required processing can be done. ASoC audio-graph based sound
driver is used to facilitate this and thus extend sound bindings as
well.

The components in the path may require different PCM parameters (such
as sample rate, channels or sample size). Depending on the pre-defined
audio paths, these can be statically configured with "convert-xxx" DT
properties in endpoint subnode. The support for the rate and channel
conversion is already available in generic audio-graph driver. Sample
size conversion support can be added based on the need in future.

The support is extended for following platforms:
 * Jertson TX1
 * Jetson Nano
 * Jetson TX2
 * Jetson AGX Xavier
 * Jetson Xavier NX
