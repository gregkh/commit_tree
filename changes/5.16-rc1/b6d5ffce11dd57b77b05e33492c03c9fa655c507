drm/panel-simple: Non-eDP panels don't need "HPD" handling

All of the "HPD" handling added to panel-simple recently was for eDP
panels. Remove it from panel-simple now that panel-edp handles eDP
panels. The "prepare_to_enable" delay only makes sense in the context
of HPD, so remove it too. No non-eDP panels used it anyway.
