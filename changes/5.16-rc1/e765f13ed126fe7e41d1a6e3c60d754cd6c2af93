nvdimm/pmem: move dax_attribute_group from dax to pmem

dax_attribute_group is only used by the pmem driver, and can avoid the
completely pointless lookup by the disk name if moved there.  This
leaves just a single caller of dax_get_by_host, so move dax_get_by_host
into the same ifdef block as that caller.
