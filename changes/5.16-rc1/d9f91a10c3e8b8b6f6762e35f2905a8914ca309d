drm/edid: Allow querying/working with the panel ID from the EDID

EDIDs have 32-bits worth of data which is intended to be used to
uniquely identify the make/model of a panel. This has historically
been used only internally in the EDID processing code to identify
quirks with panels.

We'd like to use this panel ID in panel drivers to identify which
panel is hooked up and from that information figure out power sequence
timings. Let's expose this information from the EDID code and also
allow it to be accessed early, before a connector has been created.

To make matching in the panel drivers code easier, we'll return the
panel ID as a 32-bit value. We'll provide some functions for
converting this value back and forth to something more human readable.
