ath11k: add support for setting fixed HE rate/gi/ltf

Support setting fixed HE rate/gi/ltf values that we are now able to send
to the kernel using nl80211. The added code is reusing parts of the
existing code path already used for HT/VHT. The new helpers are
symmetric to how we do it for HT/VHT.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.5.0.1-00235-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
