samples: bpf: Suppress readelf stderr when probing for BTF support

When compiling bpf samples, the following warning appears:

readelf: Error: Missing knowledge of 32-bit reloc types used in DWARF
sections of machine number 247
readelf: Warning: unable to apply unsupported reloc type 10 to section
.debug_info
readelf: Warning: unable to apply unsupported reloc type 1 to section
.debug_info
readelf: Warning: unable to apply unsupported reloc type 10 to section
.debug_info

Same problem was mentioned in commit 2f0921262ba9 ("selftests/bpf:
suppress readelf stderr when probing for BTF support"), let's use
readelf that supports btf.
