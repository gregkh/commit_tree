arm64: kexec: flush image and lists during kexec load time

Currently, during kexec load we are copying relocation function and
flushing it. However, we can also flush kexec relocation buffers and
if new kernel image is already in place (i.e. crash kernel), we can
also flush the new kernel image itself.
