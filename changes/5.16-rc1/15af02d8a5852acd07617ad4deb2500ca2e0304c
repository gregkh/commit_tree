scsi: lpfc: Allow PLOGI retry if previous PLOGI was aborted

A remote nport can stop responding to PLOGI beyond the ELS I/O timeout
under some fault conditions.  When this happens, the non-response triggers
a dev_loss_tmo event from the transport which causes the driver to abort
the PLOGI and stop any retries. This was due to a policy in the ELS
completion handler whenever an ELS was terminated due to driver request.

Revise the ELS completion path to detect PLOGIs that were aborted and
allow retries.
