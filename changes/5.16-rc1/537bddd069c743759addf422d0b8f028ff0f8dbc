EDAC/sb_edac: Fix top-of-high-memory value for Broadwell/Haswell

The computation of TOHM is off by one bit. This missed bit results in
too low a value for TOHM, which can cause errors in regular memory to
incorrectly report:

  EDAC MC0: 1 CE Error at MMIOH area, on addr 0x000000207fffa680 on any memory
