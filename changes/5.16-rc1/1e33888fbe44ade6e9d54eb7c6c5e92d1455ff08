PCI: apple: Add initial hardware bring-up

Add a minimal driver to bring up the PCIe bus on Apple system-on-chips,
particularly the Apple M1. This driver exposes the internal bus used for
the USB type-A ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Bringing up the
radios requires additional drivers beyond what's necessary for PCIe itself.
