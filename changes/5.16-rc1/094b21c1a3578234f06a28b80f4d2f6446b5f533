drm/amd/display: Fix USB4 hot plug crash issue

[Why]
Notify data from outbox corrupt, the notify type should be 2 (HPD) instead of 0
(No data). We copied the address instead of the value. The memory might be
freed in the end of outbox IRQ

[How]
We should allocate the memory of notify and copy the whole content from outbox to
hpd handle function
