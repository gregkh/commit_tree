arm64: vdso32: drop the test for dmb ishld

Binutils added support for this instruction in commit
e797f7e0b2bedc9328d4a9a0ebc63ca7a2dbbebc which shipped in 2.24 (just
missing the 2.23 release) but was cherry-picked into 2.23 in commit
27a50d6755bae906bc73b4ec1a8b448467f0bea1. Thanks to Christian and Simon
for helping me with the patch archaeology.

According to Documentation/process/changes.rst, the minimum supported
version of binutils is 2.23. Since all supported versions of GAS support
this instruction, drop the assembler invocation, preprocessor
flags/guards, and the cross assembler macro that's now unused.

This also avoids a recursive self reference in a follow up cleanup
patch.
