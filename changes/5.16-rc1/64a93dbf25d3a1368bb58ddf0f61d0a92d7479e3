NFS: Fix deadlocks in nfs_scan_commit_list()

Partially revert commit 2ce209c42c01 ("NFS: Wait for requests that are
locked on the commit list"), since it can lead to deadlocks between
commit requests and nfs_join_page_group().
For now we should assume that any locked requests on the commit list are
either about to be removed and committed by another task, or the writes
they describe are about to be retransmitted. In either case, we should
not need to worry.
