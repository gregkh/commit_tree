ath11k: Identify DFS channel when sending scan channel list command

WMI_CHAN_INFO_DFS flag should be set when configuring a DFS channel
included in scan channel list. Without it, firmware will not send a
probe request frame which is needed in connection to an AP configured
with hidden SSID/network_id. So fix this to allow probe request frames
to be sent in cases where a beacon frame has been seen on the channel
first.
