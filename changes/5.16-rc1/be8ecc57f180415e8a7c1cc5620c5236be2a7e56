perf srcline: Use long-running addr2line per DSO

Invoking addr2line in a separate subprocess, one for each required
lookup, takes a terribly long time.

This patch introduces a long-running addr2line process for each DSO,
*DRAMATICALLY* speeding up runs of perf.

What used to take tens of minutes now takes tens of seconds.
