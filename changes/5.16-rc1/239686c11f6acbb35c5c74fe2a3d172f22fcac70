s390/lcs: remove incorrect kernel doc indicators

Many comments above functions start with a kernel doc indicator, but
the comments are not using kernel doc style. Get rid of the warnings
by simply removing the indicator.

E.g.:

drivers/s390/net/lcs.c:2355: warning:
 This comment starts with '/**', but isn't a kernel-doc comment.
