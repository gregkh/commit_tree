arm64/sve: Explicitly load vector length when restoring SVE state

Currently when restoring the SVE state we supply the SVE vector length
as an argument to sve_load_state() and the underlying macros. This becomes
inconvenient with the addition of SME since we may need to restore any
combination of SVE and SME vector lengths, and we already separately
restore the vector length in the KVM code. We don't need to know the vector
length during the actual register load since the SME load instructions can
index into the data array for us.

Refactor the interface so we explicitly set the vector length separately
to restoring the SVE registers in preparation for adding SME support, no
functional change should be involved.
