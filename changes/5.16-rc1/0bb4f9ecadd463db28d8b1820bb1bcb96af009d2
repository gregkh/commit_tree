ice: unify xdp_rings accesses

There has been a long lasting issue of improper xdp_rings indexing for
XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT actions. Given that currently rx_ring->q_index
is mixed with smp_processor_id(), there could be a situation where Tx
descriptors are produced onto XDP Tx ring, but tail is never bumped -
for example pin a particular queue id to non-matching IRQ line.

Address this problem by ignoring the user ring count setting and always
initialize the xdp_rings array to be of num_possible_cpus() size. Then,
always use the smp_processor_id() as an index to xdp_rings array. This
provides serialization as at given time only a single softirq can run on
a particular CPU.
