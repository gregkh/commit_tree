parisc: Move thread_info into task struct

This implements the CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK option.

With this change:
- before thread_info was part of the stack and located at the beginning of the stack
- now the thread_info struct is moved and located inside the task_struct structure
- the stack is allocated and handled like the major other platforms
- drop the cpu field of thread_info and use instead the one in task_struct
