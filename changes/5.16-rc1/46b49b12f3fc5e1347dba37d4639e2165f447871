arch/cc: Introduce a function to check for confidential computing features

In preparation for other confidential computing technologies, introduce
a generic helper function, cc_platform_has(), that can be used to
check for specific active confidential computing attributes, like
memory encryption. This is intended to eliminate having to add multiple
technology-specific checks to the code (e.g. if (sev_active() ||
tdx_active() || ... ).
