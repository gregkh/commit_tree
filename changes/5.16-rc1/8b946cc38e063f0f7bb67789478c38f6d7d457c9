objtool: Introduce CFI hash

Andi reported that objtool on vmlinux.o consumes more memory than his
system has, leading to horrific performance.

This is in part because we keep a struct instruction for every
instruction in the file in-memory. Shrink struct instruction by
removing the CFI state (which includes full register state) from it
and demand allocating it.

Given most instructions don't actually change CFI state, there's lots
of repetition there, so add a hash table to find previous CFI
instances.

Reduces memory consumption (and runtime) for processing an
x86_64-allyesconfig:

  post: 2:14.61 real,   108.58 user,    25.04 sys,      16396184 mem
