mm: Add folio_raw_mapping()

Convert __page_rmapping to folio_raw_mapping and move it to mm/internal.h.
It's only a couple of instructions (load and mask), so it's definitely
going to be cheaper to inline it than call it.  Leave page_rmapping
out of line.  Change page_anon_vma() to not call folio_raw_mapping() --
it's more efficient to do the subtraction than the mask.
