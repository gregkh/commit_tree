smb3: do not setup the fscache_super_cookie until fsinfo initialized

We were calling cifs_fscache_get_super_cookie after tcon but before
we queried the info (QFS_Info) we need to initialize the cookie
properly.  Also includes an additional check suggested by Paulo
to make sure we don't initialize super cookie twice.
