HID: nintendo: add support for charging grip

This patch adds support for the joy-con charging grip. The peripheral
essentially behaves the same as a pro controller, but with two joy-cons
attached to the grip. However the grip exposes the two joy-cons as
separate hid devices, so extra handling is required. The joy-con is
queried to check if it is a right or left joy-con (since the product ID
is identical between left/right when using the grip).

Since controller model detection is now more complicated, the various
checks for hid product values have been replaced with helper macros to
reduce code duplication.
