dt-bindings: soc: qcom: aoss: Drop the load state power-domain

The power-domains exposed by AOSS QMP node are used to notify the Always
on Subsystem (AOSS) that a particular co-processor is up/down. These
co-processors enter low-power modes independent to that of the application
processor and their states are expected to remain unaltered across system
suspend/resume cycles. To achieve this behavior let's drop the load
power-domain and replace them with generic qmp_send interface instead.
