arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: fix display port phy reg property

Existing display port phy reg property is derived from usb phy which
map display port phy pcs to wrong address which cause aux init
with wrong address and prevent both dpcd read and write from working.
Fix this problem by assigning correct pcs address to display port
phy reg property.
