ASoC: tegra: Add Tegra210 based SFC driver

The Sampling Frequency Converter (SFC) converts the sampling frequency
of the input signal from one frequency to another. It supports sampling
frequency conversions of streams of up to two channels (stereo).

This patch registers SFC driver with ASoC framework. The component driver
exposes DAPM widgets, routes and kcontrols for the device. The DAI driver
exposes SFC interfaces, which can be used to connect different components
in the ASoC layer. Makefile and Kconfig support is added to allow build
the driver. It can be enabled in the DT via "nvidia,tegra210-sfc"
compatible binding.
