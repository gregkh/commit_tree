iio: gyro: remove dead config dependencies on INPUT_MPU3050

Commit b1fe0cf06f92 ("Input: delete MPU3050 driver") deletes the superseded
MPU3050 driver and its corresponding config INPUT_MPU3050.

The dependencies on the superseding driver in ./drivers/iio/gyro/Kconfig
to ensure that the two drivers are not built into the same kernel is a dead
dependency and not required anymore.

So, remove those config dependencies on INPUT_MPU3050 for MPU3050_I2C.

This issue was detected with ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py.
