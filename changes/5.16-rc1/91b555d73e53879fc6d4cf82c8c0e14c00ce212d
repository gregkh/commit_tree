libbpf: Schedule open_opts.attach_prog_fd deprecation since v0.7

bpf_object_open_opts.attach_prog_fd makes a pretty strong assumption
that bpf_object contains either only single freplace BPF program or all
of BPF programs in BPF object are freplaces intended to replace
different subprograms of the same target BPF program. This seems both
a bit confusing, too assuming, and limiting.

We've had bpf_program__set_attach_target() API which allows more
fine-grained control over this, on a per-program level. As such, mark
open_opts.attach_prog_fd as deprecated starting from v0.7, so that we
have one more universal way of setting freplace targets. With previous
change to allow NULL attach_func_name argument, and especially combined
with BPF skeleton, arguable bpf_program__set_attach_target() is a more
convenient and explicit API as well.
