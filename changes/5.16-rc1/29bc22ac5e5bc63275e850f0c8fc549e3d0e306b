binder: use euid from cred instead of using task

Save the 'struct cred' associated with a binder process
at initial open to avoid potential race conditions
when converting to an euid.

Set a transaction's sender_euid from the 'struct cred'
saved at binder_open() instead of looking up the euid
from the binder proc's 'struct task'. This ensures
the euid is associated with the security context that
of the task that opened binder.
