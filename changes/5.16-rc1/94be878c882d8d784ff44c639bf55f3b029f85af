iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: Avoid potential array overflow in st_lsm6dsx_set_odr()

The length of hw->settings->odr_table is 2 and ref_sensor->id is an enum
variable whose value is between 0 and 5.
However, the value ST_LSM6DSX_ID_MAX (i.e. 5) is not caught properly in
 switch (sensor->id) {

If ref_sensor->id is ST_LSM6DSX_ID_MAX, an array overflow will ocurrs in
function st_lsm6dsx_check_odr():
  odr_table = &sensor->hw->settings->odr_table[sensor->id];

and in function st_lsm6dsx_set_odr():
  reg = &hw->settings->odr_table[ref_sensor->id].reg;

To avoid this array overflow, handle ST_LSM6DSX_ID_GYRO explicitly and
return -EINVAL for the default case.

The enum value ST_LSM6DSX_ID_MAX is only present as an easy way to check
the limit and as such is never used, however this is not locally obvious.
