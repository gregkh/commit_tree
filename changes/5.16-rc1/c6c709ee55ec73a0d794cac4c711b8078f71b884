media: vivid: add signal-free time for cec message xfer

Currently, the vivid emulation of cec message transmission does not force
adapters to wait until the cec bus has been signal-free for a certain
number of bit periods before transmitting or re-transmitting a message.
Without enforcing the signal-free time requirements, adapters do not share
the bus very well and some messages are sent too quickly while other
messages are lost. By emulating a signal-free time and forcing adapters
to wait their turn to transmit, the vivid emulation of cec transmission
is much more reliable.
