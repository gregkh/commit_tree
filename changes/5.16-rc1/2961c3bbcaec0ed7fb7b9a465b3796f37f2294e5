bcache: add error handling support for add_disk()

We never checked for errors on add_disk() as this function
returned void. Now that this is fixed, use the shiny new
error handling.

This driver doesn't do any unwinding with blk_cleanup_disk()
even on errors after add_disk() and so we follow that
tradition.
