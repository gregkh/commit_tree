habanalabs: refactor reset log message

Reset to the device is not necessarily due to an error, so print it
as info instead of error.

In addition, print the type of reset we are doing:
- reset of the entire device (aka hard reset)
- reset of the device after user have released it (less than hard reset)
- lighter reset of an inference device (aka soft reset)
