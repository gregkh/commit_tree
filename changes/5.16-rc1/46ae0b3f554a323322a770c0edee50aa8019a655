ASoC: nau8821: clarify out-of-bounds check

cppcheck reports a false positive

sound/soc/codecs/nau8821.c:390:17: error: Array 'dmic_speed_sel[4]'
accessed at index 4, which is out of bounds. [arrayIndexOutOfBounds]

  dmic_speed_sel[i].param, dmic_speed_sel[i].val);
                ^
sound/soc/codecs/nau8821.c:378:2: note: After for loop, i has value 4
 for (i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++)
 ^
sound/soc/codecs/nau8821.c:390:17: note: Array index out of bounds
  dmic_speed_sel[i].param, dmic_speed_sel[i].val);
                ^

While the code is not incorrect, we can deal with the out-of-bounds
check in a clearer way that makes static analysis happy.
