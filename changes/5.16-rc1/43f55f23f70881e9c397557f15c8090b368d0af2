mctp: Add refcounts to mctp_dev

Currently, we tie the struct mctp_dev lifetime to the underlying struct
net_device, and hold/put that device as a proxy for a separate mctp_dev
refcount. This works because we're not holding any references to the
mctp_dev that are different from the netdev lifetime.

In a future change we'll break that assumption though, as we'll need to
hold mctp_dev references in a workqueue, which might live past the
netdev unregister notification.

In order to support that, this change introduces a refcount on the
mctp_dev, currently taken by the net_device->mctp_ptr reference, and
released on netdev unregister events. We can then use this for future
references that might outlast the net device.
