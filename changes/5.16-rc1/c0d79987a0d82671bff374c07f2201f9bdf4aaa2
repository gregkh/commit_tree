hwmon: (dell-smm) Speed up setting of fan speed

When setting the fan speed, i8k_set_fan() calls i8k_get_fan_status(),
causing an unnecessary SMM call since from the two users of this
function, only i8k_ioctl_unlocked() needs to know the new fan status
while dell_smm_write() ignores the new fan status.
Since SMM calls can be very slow while also making error reporting
difficult for dell_smm_write(), remove the function call from
i8k_set_fan() and call it separately in i8k_ioctl_unlocked().

Tested on a Dell Inspiron 3505.
