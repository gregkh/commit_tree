i2c: virtio: Add support for zero-length requests

The virtio specification received a new mandatory feature
(VIRTIO_I2C_F_ZERO_LENGTH_REQUEST) for zero length requests. Fail if the
feature isn't offered by the device.

For each read-request, set the VIRTIO_I2C_FLAGS_M_RD flag, as required
by the VIRTIO_I2C_F_ZERO_LENGTH_REQUEST feature.

This allows us to support zero length requests, like SMBUS Quick, where
the buffer need not be sent anymore.
