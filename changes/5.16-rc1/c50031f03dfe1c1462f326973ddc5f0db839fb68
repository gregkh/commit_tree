firmware: qcom: scm: Don't break compile test on non-ARM platforms

The introduction of __qcom_scm_set_boot_addr_mc() relies on
cpu_logical_map() and MPIDR_AFFINITY_LEVEL() from smp_plat.h, but only
ARM and ARM64 has this include file, so the introduction of this
dependency broke compile testing on e.g. x86_64.

Make the inclusion of smp_plat.h and the affected function depend on
ARM || ARM64 to allow the code to still be compiled.
