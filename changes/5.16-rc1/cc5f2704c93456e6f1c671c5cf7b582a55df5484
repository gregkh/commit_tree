proc/vmcore: convert oldmem_pfn_is_ram callback to more generic vmcore callbacks

Let's support multiple registered callbacks, making sure that
registering vmcore callbacks cannot fail.  Make the callback return a
bool instead of an int, handling how to deal with errors internally.
Drop unused HAVE_OLDMEM_PFN_IS_RAM.

We soon want to make use of this infrastructure from other drivers:
virtio-mem, registering one callback for each virtio-mem device, to
prevent reading unplugged virtio-mem memory.

Handle it via a generic vmcore_cb structure, prepared for future
extensions: for example, once we support virtio-mem on s390x where the
vmcore is completely constructed in the second kernel, we want to detect
and add plugged virtio-mem memory ranges to the vmcore in order for them
to get dumped properly.

Handle corner cases that are unexpected and shouldn't happen in sane
setups: registering a callback after the vmcore has already been opened
(warn only) and unregistering a callback after the vmcore has already been
opened (warn and essentially read only zeroes from that point on).
