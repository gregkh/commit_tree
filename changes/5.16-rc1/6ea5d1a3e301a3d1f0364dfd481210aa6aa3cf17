perf script: Support instruction latency

The instruction latency information can be recorded on
some platforms, e.g., the Intel Sapphire Rapids server. With both memory
latency (weight) and the new instruction latency information, users can
easily locate the expensive load instructions, and also understand the time
spent in different stages. The users can optimize their applications in
different pipeline stages.

Add a new field "ins_lat" to filter the instruction latency information,
which is available with sample type PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT.
