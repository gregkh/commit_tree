mtd: core: don't remove debugfs directory if device is in use

Previously, if del_mtd_device() failed with -EBUSY due to a non-zero
usecount, a subsequent call to attempt the deletion again would try to
remove a debugfs directory that had already been removed and panic.
With this change the second call can instead proceed safely.
