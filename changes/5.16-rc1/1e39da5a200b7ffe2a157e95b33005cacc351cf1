drm/i915: Enable TPS3/4 on all platforms that support them

Stop using HBR2/3 support as a proxy for TPS3/4 support.
The two are no longer 1:1 in the hardware, arguably they
never were due to HSW ULX which does support TPS3 while
being limited to HBR1.

In more recent times GLK gained support for TPS4 while
being limited to HBR2. And on CNL+ some ports support
HBR3 while others are limited to HBR2, but all ports
support TPS4.
