netdevsim: move max vf config to dev

max_vfs is a strange little beast because the file
hangs off of nsim's debugfs, but it configures a field
in the bus device. Move it to dev.c, let's look at it
as if the device driver was imposing VF limit based
on FW info (like pci_sriov_set_totalvfs()).

Again, when moving refactor the function not to hold
the vfs lock pointlessly while parsing the input.
Wrap the access from the read side in READ_ONCE()
to appease concurrency checkers. Do not check if
return value from snprintf() is negative...
