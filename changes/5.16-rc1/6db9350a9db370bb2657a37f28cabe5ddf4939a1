devlink: Delete not-used devlink APIs

Devlink core exported generously the functions calls that were used
by netdevsim tests or not used at all.

Delete such APIs with one exception - devlink_alloc_ns(). That function
should be spared from deleting because it is a special form of devlink_alloc()
needed for the netdevsim.
