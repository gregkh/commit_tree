drm/i915/guc: Move and improve error message for missed CTB reply

If we timeout waiting for a CT reply we print very simple error
message. Improve that and by moving error reporting to the caller
we can use CT_ERROR instead of DRM_ERROR and report just fence
as error code will be reported later anyway.
