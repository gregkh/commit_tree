mtd: Remove obsolete macros only used by the old nand_ecclayout struct

All uses of MTD_MAX_{OOBFREE,ECCPOS}_ENTRIES_LARGE have been removed as
commit ef5eeea6e911 ("mtd: nand: brcm: switch to mtd_ooblayout_ops") and
commit aab616e31d1c ("mtd: kill the nand_ecclayout struct") replaced
struct nand_ecclayout by the new mtd_ooblayout_ops interface. Remove
these two macros therefore.
