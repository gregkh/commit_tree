staging: vchiq_core: fix quoted strings split across lines

Quoted strings should not be split across lines. As put it in [1]:
"never break user-visible strings such as printk messages because that
breaks the ability to grep for them."

While at it, fix the alignment of the arguments in the sentence.

Note: this introduce a checkpatch CHECK: line length of 123 exceeds 100
columns, as the line now is:

 vchiq_loud_error("%d: service %d (%c%c%c%c) version mismatch - local (%d, min %d) vs. remote (%d, min %d)",

But now the string is grep-able and the whole function call more
clear.
