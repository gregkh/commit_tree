ALSA: usb-audio: Restrict rates for the shared clocks

When a single clock source is shared among several endpoints, we have
to keep the same rate on all active endpoints as long as the clock is
being used.  For dealing with such a case, this patch adds one more
check in the hw params constraint for the rate to take the shared
clocks into account.  The current rate is evaluated from the endpoint
list that applies the same clock source.
