s390/kexec_file: move kernel image size check

In preparation of adding support for command lines with variable
sizes on s390, the check whether the new kernel image is at least HEAD_END
bytes long isn't correct. Move the check to kexec_file_add_components()
so we can get the size of the parm area and check the size there.

The '.org HEAD_END' directive can now also be removed from head.S. This
was used in the past to reserve space for the early sccb buffer, but with
commit 9a5131b87cac1 ("s390/boot: move sclp early buffer from fixed address
in asm to C") this is no longer required.
