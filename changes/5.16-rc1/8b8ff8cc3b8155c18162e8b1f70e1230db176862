perf/x86: Add new event for AUX output counter index

PEBS-via-PT records contain a mask of applicable counters. To identify
which event belongs to which counter, a side-band event is needed. Until
now, there has been no side-band event, and consequently users were limited
to using a single event.

Add such a side-band event. Note the event is optimised to output only
when the counter index changes for an event. That works only so long as
all PEBS-via-PT events are scheduled together, which they are for a
recording session because they are in a single group.

Also no attribute bit is used to select the new event, so a new
kernel is not compatible with older perf tools.  The assumption
being that PEBS-via-PT is sufficiently esoteric that users will not
be troubled by this.
