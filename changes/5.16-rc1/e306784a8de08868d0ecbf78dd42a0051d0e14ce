cfg80211: AP mode driver offload for FILS association crypto

Add a driver FILS crypto offload extended capability flag to indicate
that the driver running in AP mode is capable of handling encryption
and decryption of (Re)Association request and response frames.
Add a command to set FILS AAD data to driver.

This feature is supported on drivers running in AP mode only.
This extended capability is exchanged with hostapd during cfg80211
init. If the driver indicates this capability, then before sending the
Authentication response frame, hostapd sets FILS AAD data to the
driver. This allows the driver to decrypt (Re)Association Request
frame and encrypt (Re)Association Response frame. FILS Key derivation
will still be done in hostapd.
