RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix FRMR issue with single page MR allocation

When the FRMR is allocated with single page, driver is attempting to
create a level 0 HWQ and not allocating any page because the nopte field
is set. This causes the crash during post_send as the pbl is not
populated.

To avoid this crash, check for the nopte bit during HWQ creation with
single page and create a level 1 page table and populate the pbl address
correctly.
