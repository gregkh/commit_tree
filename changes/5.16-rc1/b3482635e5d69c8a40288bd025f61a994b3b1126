crypto: arm64/aes-ccm - remove non-SIMD fallback path

AES/CCM on arm64 is implemented as a synchronous AEAD, and so it is
guaranteed by the API that it is only invoked in task or softirq
context. Since softirqs are now only handled when the SIMD is not
being used in the task context that was interrupted to service the
softirq, we no longer need a fallback path. Let's remove it.
