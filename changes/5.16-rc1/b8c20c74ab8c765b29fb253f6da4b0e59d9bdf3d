drm/amd/amdkfd: Don't sent command to HWS on kfd reset

When kfd need to be reset, sent command to HWS might cause hang and get unnecessary timeout.
This change try not to touch HW in pre_reset and keep queues to be in the evicted state
when the reset is done, so they are not put back on the runlist. These queues will be destroied
on process termination.
