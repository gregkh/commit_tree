crypto: qat - extract send and wait from adf_vf2pf_request_version()

In the function adf_vf2pf_request_version(), the VF sends a request to
the PF and waits for a response before parsing and handling it.

Since this pattern will be used by other requests, define a new
function, adf_send_vf2pf_req(), that only deals with sending a VF2PF
request and waiting for a response.
