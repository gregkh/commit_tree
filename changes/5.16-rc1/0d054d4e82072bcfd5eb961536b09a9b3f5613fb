x86/boot: Allow a "silent" kaslr random byte fetch

Under earlyprintk, each RNG call produces a debug report line. To support
the future FGKASLR feature, which will fetch random bytes during function
shuffling, this is not useful information (each line is identical and
tells us nothing new), needlessly spamming the console. Instead, allow
for a NULL "purpose" to suppress the debug reporting.
