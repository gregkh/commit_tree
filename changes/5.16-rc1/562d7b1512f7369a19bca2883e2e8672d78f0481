btrfs: handle device lookup with btrfs_dev_lookup_args

We have a lot of device lookup functions that all do something slightly
different.  Clean this up by adding a struct to hold the different
lookup criteria, and then pass this around to btrfs_find_device() so it
can do the proper matching based on the lookup criteria.
