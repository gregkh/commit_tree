signal: Implement force_fatal_sig

Add a simple helper force_fatal_sig that causes a signal to be
delivered to a process as if the signal handler was set to SIG_DFL.

Reimplement force_sigsegv based upon this new helper.  This fixes
force_sigsegv so that when it forces the default signal handler
to be used the code now forces the signal to be unblocked as well.

Reusing the tested logic in force_sig_info_to_task that was built for
force_sig_seccomp this makes the implementation trivial.

This is interesting both because it makes force_sigsegv simpler and
because there are a couple of buggy places in the kernel that call
do_exit(SIGILL) or do_exit(SIGSYS) because there is no straight
forward way today for those places to simply force the exit of a
process with the chosen signal.  Creating force_fatal_sig allows
those places to be implemented with normal signal exits.
