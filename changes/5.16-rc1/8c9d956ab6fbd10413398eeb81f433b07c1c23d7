ionic: allow adminq requests to override default error message

The AdminQ handler has an error handler that automatically prints
an error message when the request has failed.  However, there are
situations where the caller can expect that it might fail and has
an alternative strategy, thus may not want the error message sent
to the log, such as hitting -ENOSPC when adding a new vlan id.

We add a new interface to the AdminQ API to allow for override of
the default behavior, and an interface to the use standard error
message formatting.
