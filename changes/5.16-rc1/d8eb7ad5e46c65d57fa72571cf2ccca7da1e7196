ice: update dim usage and moderation

The driver was having trouble with unreliable latency when doing single
threaded ping-pong tests. This was root caused to the DIM algorithm
landing on a too slow interrupt value, which caused high latency, and it
was especially present when queues were being switched frequently by the
scheduler as happens on default setups today.

In attempting to improve this, we allow the upper rate limit for
interrupts to move to rate limit of 4 microseconds as a max, which means
that no vector can generate more than 250,000 interrupts per second. The
old config was up to 100,000. The driver previously tried to program the
rate limit too frequently and if the receive and transmit side were both
active on the same vector, the INTRL would be set incorrectly, and this
change fixes that issue as a side effect of the redesign.

This driver will operate from now on with a slightly changed DIM table
with more emphasis towards latency sensitivity by having more table
entries with lower latency than with high latency (high being >= 64
microseconds).

The driver also resets the DIM algorithm state with a new stats set when
there is no work done and the data becomes stale (older than 1 second),
for the respective receive or transmit portion of the interrupt.

Add a new helper for setting rate limit, which will be used more
in a followup patch.
