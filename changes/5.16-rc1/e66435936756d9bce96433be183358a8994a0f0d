mm: fix mismerge of folio page flag manipulators

I had missed a semantic conflict between commit d389a4a81155 ("mm: Add
folio flag manipulation functions") from the folio tree, and commit
eac96c3efdb5 ("mm: filemap: check if THP has hwpoisoned subpage for PMD
page fault") that added a new set of page flags.

My build tests had too many options enabled, which hid this issue.  But
if you didn't have MEMORY_FAILURE or TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE enabled, you'd
end up with build errors like this:

  include/linux/page-flags.h:806:29: error: macro "PAGEFLAG_FALSE" requires 2 arguments, but only 1 given
    806 | PAGEFLAG_FALSE(HasHWPoisoned)
        |                             ^

due to the missing lowercase name used for folio function naming.
