ASoC: cs42l42: Prevent NULL pointer deref in interrupt handler

The interrupt handling code was getting the struct device* from a
struct snd_soc_component* stored in struct cs42l42_private. If the
interrupt was asserted before ASoC calls component_probe() the
snd_soc_component* will be NULL.

The stored snd_soc_component* is not actually used for anything other
than indirectly getting the struct device*. Remove it, and store the
struct device* in struct cs42l42_private.
