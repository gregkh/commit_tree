iwlwifi: pcie: simplify iwl_pci_find_dev_info()

We currently match the list of devices from the start to
the end, but then find the *last* match, so we need to
look at each and every entry. We don't want to change the
semantics ("most generic entry must come first"), so just
change the order of matching to be back-to-front, then we
can break out once we find a match.
