mm: Introduce struct folio

A struct folio is a new abstraction to replace the venerable struct page.
A function which takes a struct folio argument declares that it will
operate on the entire (possibly compound) page, not just PAGE_SIZE bytes.
In return, the caller guarantees that the pointer it is passing does
not point to a tail page.  No change to generated code.
