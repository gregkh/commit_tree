ALSA: oxfw: fix functional regression for Mackie Onyx 1640i in v5.14 or later

A user reports functional regression for Mackie Onyx 1640i that the device
generates slow sound with ALSA oxfw driver which supports media clock
recovery. Although the device is based on OXFW971 ASIC, it does not
transfer isochronous packet with own event frequency as expected. The
device seems to adjust event frequency according to events in received
isochronous packets in the beginning of packet streaming. This is
unknown quirk.

This commit fixes the regression to turn the recovery off in driver
side. As a result, nominal frequency is used in duplex packet streaming
between device and driver. For stability of sampling rate in events of
transferred isochronous packet, 4,000 isochronous packets are skipped
in the beginning of packet streaming.
