io_uring: warning about unused-but-set parameter

When enabling -Wunused warnings by building with W=1, I get an
instance of the -Wunused-but-set-parameter warning in the io_uring code:

fs/io_uring.c: In function 'io_queue_async_work':
fs/io_uring.c:1445:61: error: parameter 'locked' set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-parameter]
 1445 | static void io_queue_async_work(struct io_kiocb *req, bool *locked)
      |                                                       ~~~~~~^~~~~~

There are very few warnings of this type, so it would be nice to enable
this by default and fix all the existing instances. As the assignment
serves no purpose by itself other than to prevent developers from using
the variable, an easy workaround is to remove the assignment and just
rename the argument to "dont_use".
