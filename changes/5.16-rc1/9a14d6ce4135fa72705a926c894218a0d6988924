block: remove debugfs blk_mq_ctx dispatched/merged/completed attributes

These were added as part of early days debugging for blk-mq, and they
are not really useful anymore. Rather than spend cycles updating them,
just get rid of them.

As a bonus, this shrinks the per-cpu software queue size from 256b
to 192b. That's a whole cacheline less.
