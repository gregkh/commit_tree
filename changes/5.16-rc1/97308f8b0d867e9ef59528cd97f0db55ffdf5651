iomap: Support partial direct I/O on user copy failures

In iomap_dio_rw, when iomap_apply returns an -EFAULT error and the
IOMAP_DIO_PARTIAL flag is set, complete the request synchronously and
return a partial result.  This allows the caller to deal with the page
fault and retry the remainder of the request.
