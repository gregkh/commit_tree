ASoC: amd: Add common framework to support I2S on ACP SOC

We are using legacy way of exposing dais and DMA configuration that
requires separate driver modules for various ACP SOC with almost
similar hw configuration. Moreover the legacy approach requires
separate I2S and DMA module platform devices registration and need
machine specific quirk to control various I2S endpoints. Add generic
dai driver and platform driver for I2S controller on ACP hw block.
This common framework can be used by various ACP platform devices
that shares common specs.
