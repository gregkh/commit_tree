platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Update timeout value in comment

The comment decribing the IPC timeout hadn't been updated when the
actual timeout was changed from 3 to 5 seconds in
commit a7d53dbbc70a ("platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Increase virtual
timeout from 3 to 5 seconds") .

Since the value is anyway updated to 10s now, take this opportunity to
update the value in the comment too.
