x86/fpu/amx: Enable the AMX feature in 64-bit mode

Add the AMX state components in XFEATURE_MASK_USER_SUPPORTED and the
TILE_DATA component to the dynamic states and update the permission check
table accordingly.

This is only effective on 64 bit kernels as for 32bit kernels
XFEATURE_MASK_TILE is defined as 0.

TILE_DATA is caller-saved state and the only dynamic state. Add build time
sanity check to ensure the assumption that every dynamic feature is caller-
saved.

Make AMX state depend on XFD as it is dynamic feature.
