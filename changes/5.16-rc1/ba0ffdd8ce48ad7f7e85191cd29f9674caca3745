block: bump max plugged deferred size from 16 to 32

Particularly for NVMe with efficient deferred submission for many
requests, there are nice benefits to be seen by bumping the default max
plug count from 16 to 32. This is especially true for virtualized setups,
where the submit part is more expensive. But can be noticed even on
native hardware.

Reduce the multiple queue factor from 4 to 2, since we're changing the
default size.

While changing it, move the defines into the block layer private header.
These aren't values that anyone outside of the block layer uses, or
should use.
