media: mtk-vcodec: vdec: handle firmware version field

Firmwares for decoders newer than MT8173 will include an ABI version
number in their initialization ack message. Add the capacity to manage
it and make initialization fail if the firmware ABI is of a version that
we don't support.

For MT8173, this ABI version field does not exist ; thus ignore it on
this chip. There should only be one firmware version available for it
anyway.
