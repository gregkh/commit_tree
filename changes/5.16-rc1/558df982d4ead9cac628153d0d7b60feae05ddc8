iio: dac: ad5446: Fix ad5622_write() return value

On success i2c_master_send() returns the number of bytes written. The
call from iio_write_channel_info(), however, expects the return value to
be zero on success.

This bug causes incorrect consumption of the sysfs buffer in
iio_write_channel_info(). When writing more than two characters to
out_voltage0_raw, the ad5446 write handler is called multiple times
causing unexpected behavior.
