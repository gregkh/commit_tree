drm/i915/hdcp: update cp_irq_count_cached in intel_dp_hdcp2_read_msg()

Update cp_irq_count_cached when reading messages rather than when
writing a message to make sure the value is up to date and not
stale from a previously handled CP_IRQ.

AKE flow  doesn't always respond to a read with a ACK write msg.
E.g. AKE_Send_Pairing_Info will "timeout" because we received
a CP_IRQ for reading AKE_Send_H_Prime but no write occurred between that
and reading AKE_Send_Pairing_Info so cp_irq_count_cached is stale
causing the wait to return right away rather than waiting for a new
CP_IRQ.
