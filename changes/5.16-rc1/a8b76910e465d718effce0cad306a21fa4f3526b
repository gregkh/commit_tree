preempt: Restore preemption model selection configs

Commit c597bfddc9e9 ("sched: Provide Kconfig support for default dynamic
preempt mode") changed the selectable config names for the preemption
model. This means a config file must now select

  CONFIG_PREEMPT_BEHAVIOUR=y

rather than

  CONFIG_PREEMPT=y

to get a preemptible kernel. This means all arch config files would need to
be updated - right now they'll all end up with the default
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE_BEHAVIOUR.

Rather than touch a good hundred of config files, restore usage of
CONFIG_PREEMPT{_NONE, _VOLUNTARY}. Make them configure:
o The build-time preemption model when !PREEMPT_DYNAMIC
o The default boot-time preemption model when PREEMPT_DYNAMIC

Add siblings of those configs with the _BUILD suffix to unconditionally
designate the build-time preemption model (PREEMPT_DYNAMIC is built with
the "highest" preemption model it supports, aka PREEMPT). Downstream
configs should by now all be depending / selected by CONFIG_PREEMPTION
rather than CONFIG_PREEMPT, so only a few sites need patching up.
