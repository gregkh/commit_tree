ASoC: amd: acp: declare and add prefix to 'bt_uart_enable' symbol

Sparse reports the following warning:

sound/soc/amd/acp-pcm-dma.c:39:6: error: symbol 'bt_uart_enable' was
not declared. Should it be static?

It's not very good practice to export such symbols that can easily
conflict, add the acp_ prefix and add declaration in header file.
