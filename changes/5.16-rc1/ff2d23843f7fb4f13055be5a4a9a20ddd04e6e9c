dma-buf/poll: Get a file reference for outstanding fence callbacks

This makes sure we don't hit the

	BUG_ON(dmabuf->cb_in.active || dmabuf->cb_out.active);

in dma_buf_release, which could be triggered by user space closing the
dma-buf file description while there are outstanding fence callbacks
from dma_buf_poll.
