ASoC: audio-graph-card2-custom-sample.dtsi: add Sample DT for Normal (Single)

Audio Graph Card2 settings is a little bit difficult for beginner,
and Customizing it also difficult/confusable too.
So, this patch adds sample for it.

You can easily use it by adding below line on your DT file,
and select CONFIGs to your .config.

	#include "../../../../../sound/soc/generic/audio-graph-card2-custom-sample.dtsi"

	CONFIG_SND_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD2
	CONFIG_SND_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD2_CUSTOM_SAMPLE
	CONFIG_SND_TEST_COMPONENT

This patch uses audio-graph-card2 base custom sample driver.
You can directly use audio-graph-card2 instead of custom sample driver
by modifing compatible.

	- compatible = "audio-graph-card2-custom-sample";
	+ compatible = "audio-graph-card2";

Sample custom driver will indicate customized print.

It is using Test-Component driver for CPU/Codec.
It can indicate more detail print of each behavior if user want to.
In such case, you need to update compatible to "xxx-nv" or "xxx-vv".

	- compatible = "test-cpu";
	+ compatible = "test-cpu-verbose";
