btrfs: defrag: introduce helper to defrag one cluster

This new helper, defrag_one_cluster(), will defrag one cluster (at most
256K):

- Collect all initial targets

- Kick in readahead when possible

- Call defrag_one_range() on each initial target
  With some extra range clamping.

- Update @sectors_defragged parameter

This involves one behavior change, the defragged sectors accounting is
no longer as accurate as old behavior, as the initial targets are not
consistent.

We can have new holes punched inside the initial target, and we will
skip such holes later.
But the defragged sectors accounting doesn't need to be that accurate
anyway, thus I don't want to pass those extra accounting burden into
defrag_one_range().
