arm64: defconfig: Enable Qualcomm prima/pronto drivers

The Qualcomm prima/pronto drivers consists of a remoteproc driver boot
the combined WiFi and Bluetooth firmware on the related co-processor, a
control driver to load calibration and settings firmware, the wcn36xx
WiFi driver and the SMD based Bluetooth driver.

Enable these in the defconfig to provide Bluetooth and WiFi on devices
such as the Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c.
