KVM: arm64: selftests: Add test for legacy GICv3 REDIST base partially above IPA range

Add a new test into vgic_init which checks that the first vcpu fails to
run if there is not sufficient REDIST space below the addressable IPA
range.  This only applies to the KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST legacy API
as the required REDIST space is not know when setting the DIST region.

Note that using the REDIST_REGION API results in a different check at
first vcpu run: that the number of redist regions is enough for all
vcpus. And there is already a test for that case in, the first step of
test_v3_new_redist_regions.
