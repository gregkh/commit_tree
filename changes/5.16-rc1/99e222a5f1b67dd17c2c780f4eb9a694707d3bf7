cxl/pci: Make 'struct cxl_mem' device type generic

In preparation for adding a unit test provider of a cxl_memdev, convert
the 'struct cxl_mem' driver context to carry a generic device rather
than a pci device.

Note, some dev_dbg() lines needed extra reformatting per clang-format.

This conversion also allows the cxl_mem_create() and
devm_cxl_add_memdev() calling conventions to be simplified. The "host"
for a cxl_memdev, must be the same device for the driver that allocated
@cxlm.
