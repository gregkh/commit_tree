drm/amdgpu: check tiling flags when creating FB on GFX8-

On GFX9+, format modifiers are always enabled and ensure the
frame-buffers can be scanned out at ADDFB2 time.

On GFX8-, format modifiers are not supported and no other check
is performed. This means ADDFB2 IOCTLs will succeed even if the
tiling isn't supported for scan-out, and will result in garbage
displayed on screen [1].

Fix this by adding a check for tiling flags for GFX8 and older.
The check is taken from radeonsi in Mesa (see how is_displayable
is populated in gfx6_compute_surface).

Changes in v2: use drm_WARN_ONCE instead of drm_WARN (Michel)
