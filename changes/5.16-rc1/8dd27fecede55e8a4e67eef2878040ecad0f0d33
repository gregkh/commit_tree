ext4: check for out-of-order index extents in ext4_valid_extent_entries()

After commit 5946d089379a ("ext4: check for overlapping extents in
ext4_valid_extent_entries()"), we can check out the overlapping extent
entry in leaf extent blocks. But the out-of-order extent entry in index
extent blocks could also trigger bad things if the filesystem is
inconsistent. So this patch add a check to figure out the out-of-order
index extents and return error.
