libbpf: Introduce legacy kprobe events support

Allow kprobe tracepoint events creation through legacy interface, as the
kprobe dynamic PMUs support, used by default, was only created in v4.17.

Store legacy kprobe name in struct bpf_perf_link, instead of creating
a new "subclass" off of bpf_perf_link. This is ok as it's just two new
fields, which are also going to be reused for legacy uprobe support in
follow up patches.
