net: sched: Use _bstats_update/set() instead of raw writes

The Qdisc::running sequence counter, used to protect Qdisc::bstats reads
from parallel writes, is in the process of being removed. Qdisc::bstats
read/writes will synchronize using an internal u64_stats sync point
instead.

Modify all bstats writes to use _bstats_update(). This ensures that
the internal u64_stats sync point is always acquired and released as
appropriate.
