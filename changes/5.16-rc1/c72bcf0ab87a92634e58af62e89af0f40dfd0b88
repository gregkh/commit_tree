cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix cpu->pstate.turbo_freq initialization

Fix a problem in active mode that cpu->pstate.turbo_freq is initialized
only if HWP-to-frequency scaling factor is refined.

In passive mode, this problem is not exposed, because
cpu->pstate.turbo_freq is set again, later in
intel_cpufreq_cpu_init()->intel_pstate_get_hwp_cap().
