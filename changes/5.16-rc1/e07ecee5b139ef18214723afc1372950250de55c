ARM: config: multi v7: Clean up enabled by default options

A number of options in the defconfig are enabled by other options;
either through selects or defaults.

SECCOMP is on by default as of commit 282a181b1a0d ("seccomp: Move config
option SECCOMP to arch/Kconfig").

NET_SWITCHDEV is enabled by NET_DSA. I think this is a result of commit
227d72063fcc ("dsa: simplify Kconfig symbols and dependencies").

SIMPLE_PM_BUS is selected ARCH_OMAP2PLUS as of commit 2a39af3870e9 ("ARM:
OMAP2+: Fix booting for am335x after moving to simple-pm-bus").

MICREL_PHY is selected by the ks8851 ethernet driver as of f0791b92d2b6 ("net:
ks8851: Select PHYLIB and MICREL_PHY in Kconfig").

SMSC_PHY is selected by USB_NET_SMSC95XX as of commit 05b35e7eb9a1 ("smsc95xx:
add phylib support").

STMPE_I2C is default y. It was explicitly added to the defconfig in commit
d8f0ddc83877 ("ARM: defconfig: add STMPE ADC driver for P4 Note") but it's not
required.

CLK_ACTIONS and CLK_OWL_S500 was explicitly added in commit 26ba4a474aec ("ARM:
multi_v7_defconfig: Enable Actions Semi platform and drivers"), but it defaults
on when ARCH_ACTIONS is enabled. Drop them.

CROS_EC_CHARDEV defaults to MFD_CROS_EC_DEV, which defaults to CROS_EC since
commit 2fa2b980e3fe ("mfd / platform: cros_ec: Rename config to a better name").

TEGRA20_APB_DMA is selected by SOC_TEGRA_FUSE if ARCH_TEGRA_2x_SOC since commit
19d41e5e9c68 ("soc/tegra: fuse: Add APB DMA dependency for Tegra20").

USB_CHIPIDEA_TEGRA is enabled when USB_CHIPIDEA is enabled. It falls out
of the defconfig but is enabled, as intended by d50229cee69b ("ARM:
multi_v7_defconfig: Stop using deprecated USB_EHCI_TEGRA").

SERIAL_OWL_CONSOLE defaults to on when SERIAL_OWL=y, and has since it
was introduced.

Commit c6774ee035dc ("media: Kconfig: make filtering devices optional")
made MEDIA_PLATFORM_SUPPORT, MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT and MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT
default y if MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER is disabled, so they fall out of the
defconfig.

MEDIA_CONTROLLER is selected by a number of drivers in the config, and
additionally defaults to MEDIA_PLATFORM_SUPPORT which is enabled.
