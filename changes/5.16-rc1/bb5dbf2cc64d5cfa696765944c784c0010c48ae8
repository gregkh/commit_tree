net: marvell: prestera: add firmware v4.0 support

Add firmware (FW) version 4.0 support for Marvell Prestera
driver.

Major changes have been made to new v4.0 FW ABI to add support
of new features, introduce the stability of the FW ABI and ensure
better forward compatibility for the future driver vesrions.

Current v4.0 FW feature set support does not expect any changes
to ABI, as it was defined and tested through long period of time.
The ABI may be extended in case of new features, but it will not
break the backward compatibility.

ABI major changes done in v4.0:
- L1 ABI, where MAC and PHY API configuration are split.
- ACL has been split to low-level TCAM and Counters ABI
  to provide more HW ACL capabilities for future driver
  versions.

To support backward support, the addition compatibility layer is
required in the driver which will have two different codebase under
"if FW-VER elif FW-VER else" conditions that will be removed
in the future anyway, So, the idea was to break backward support
and focus on more stable FW instead of supporting old version
with very minimal and limited set of features/capabilities.

Improve FW msg validation:
 * Use __le64, __le32, __le16 types in msg to/from FW to
   catch endian mismatch by sparse.
 * Use BUILD_BUG_ON for structures sent/recv to/from FW.
