Documentation/kcov: include types.h in the example

Patch series "kcov: PREEMPT_RT fixup + misc", v2.

The last patch in series is follow-up to address the PREEMPT_RT issue
within in kcov reported by Clark [1].  Patches 1-3 are smaller things that
I noticed while staring at it.  Patch 4 is small change which makes
replacement in #5 simpler / more obvious.

This patch (of 5):

The first example code has includes at the top, the following two
example share that part. The last example (remote coverage collection)
requires the linux/types.h header file due its __aligned_u64 usage.

Add the linux/types.h to the top most example and a comment that the
header files from above are required as it is done in the second
example.
