scsi: pm80xx: Fix lockup in outbound queue management

Commit 1f02beff224e ("scsi: pm80xx: Remove global lock from outbound queue
processing") introduced a lock per outbound queue. Prior to that change the
driver was using a global lock for all outbound queues.

While processing the I/O responses and events the driver takes the outbound
queue spinlock and is supposed to release it in pm8001_ccb_task_free_done()
before calling command done(). Since the older code was using a global
lock, pm8001_ccb_task_free_done() was releasing the global spin lock. The
change that split the lock per outbound queue did not consider this and
pm8001_ccb_task_free_done() was still releasing the global lock.
