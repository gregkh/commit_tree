drm/i915/gt: Register the migrate contexts with their engines

Pinned contexts, like the migrate contexts need reset after resume
since their context image may have been lost. Also the GuC needs to
register pinned contexts.

Add a list to struct intel_engine_cs where we add all pinned contexts on
creation, and traverse that list at resume time to reset the pinned
contexts.

This fixes the kms_pipe_crc_basic@suspend-read-crc-pipe-a selftest for now,
but proper LMEM backup / restore is needed for full suspend functionality.
However, note that even with full LMEM backup / restore it may be
desirable to keep the reset since backing up the migrate context images
must happen using memcpy() after the migrate context has become inactive,
and for performance- and other reasons we want to avoid memcpy() from
LMEM.

Also traverse the list at guc_init_lrc_mapping() calling
guc_kernel_context_pin() for the pinned contexts, like is already done
for the kernel context.

v2:
- Don't reset the contexts on each __engine_unpark() but rather at
  resume time (Chris Wilson).
v3:
- Reset contexts in the engine sanitize callback. (Chris Wilson)
