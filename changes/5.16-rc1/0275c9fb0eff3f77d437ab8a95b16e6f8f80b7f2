thermal/core: Make the userspace governor deprecated

The userspace governor is sending temperature when polling is active
and trip point crossed events. Nothing else.

AFAICT, this governor is used with custom kernels making the userspace
governor co-existing with another governor on the same thermal zone
because there was no notification mechanism, implying a hack in the
framework to support this configuration.

The new netlink thermal notification is able to provide more
information than the userspace governor and give the opportunity to
the users of this governor to replace it by a dedicated notification
framework.

The userspace governor will be removed as its usage is no longer
needed.

Add a warning message to tell the userspace governor is deprecated.
