MIPS: loongson64: Drop call to irq_cpu_offline()

Also loongson64 calls irq_cpu_offline(), none of its interrupt
controllers implement the .irq_cpu_offline callback.

It is thus obvious that this call only serves the dubious purpose
of wasting precious CPU cycles by iterating over all interrupts.

Get rid of the call altogether.
