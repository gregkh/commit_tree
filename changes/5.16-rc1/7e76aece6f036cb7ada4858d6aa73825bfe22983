auxdisplay: Extract character line display core support

Extract the character line display core support from the simple ASCII
LCD driver for the MIPS Boston, Malta & SEAD3 development boards into
its own subdriver, so it can be reused for other displays.

As this moves the "message" device attribute in sysfs in a "linedisp.N"
subdirectory, a symlink is added to preserve backwards compatibility.
