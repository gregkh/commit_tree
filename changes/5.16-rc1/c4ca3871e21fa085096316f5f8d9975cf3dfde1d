ALSA: hda: Use position buffer for SKL+ again

The commit f87e7f25893d ("ALSA: hda - Improved position reporting on
SKL+") changed the PCM position report for SKL+ chips to use DPIB, but
according to Pierre, DPIB is no best choice for the accurate position
reports and it often reports too early.  The recommended method is
rather the classical position buffer.

This patch makes the PCM position reporting on SKL+ back to the
position buffer again.
