drm/i915/gtt: add some flushing for the 64K GTT path

If we need to mark the PDE as operating in 64K GTT mode, we should be
paranoid and flush the extra writes, like we already do for the PTEs. On
some platforms the clflush can apparently add the just the right amount
of magical delay to force the GPU to see the updated entry.
