drm: msm: hdmi: Constify static structs

The only usage of hdmi_8996_pll_ops is to assign its address to the ops
field in the clk_init_data struct, and the only usage of pll_init is to
assign its address to the init field in the clk_hw struct, both which
are pointers to const. Make them const to allow the compiler to put them
in read-only memory.
