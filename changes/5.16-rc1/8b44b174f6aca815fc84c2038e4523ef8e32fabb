KVM: x86: Add helper to consolidate core logic of SET_CPUID{2} flows

Move the core logic of SET_CPUID and SET_CPUID2 to a common helper, the
only difference between the two ioctls() is the format of the userspace
struct.  A future fix will add yet more code to the core logic.

No functional change intended.
