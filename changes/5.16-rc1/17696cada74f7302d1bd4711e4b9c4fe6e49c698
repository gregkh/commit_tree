qed: fix ll2 establishment during load of RDMA driver

If stats ID of a LL2 (light l2) queue exceeds than the total amount
of statistics counters, it may cause system crash upon enabling
RDMA on all PFs.

This patch makes sure that the stats ID of the LL2 queue doesn't exceed
the max allowed value.
