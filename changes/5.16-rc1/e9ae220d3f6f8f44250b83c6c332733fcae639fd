drm/panfrost: Use upper/lower_32_bits helpers

Use upper_32_bits/lower_32_bits helpers instead of open-coding them.
This is easier to scan quickly compared to bitwise manipulation, and it
is pleasingly symmetric. I noticed this when debugging lock_region,
which had a particularly "creative" way of writing upper_32_bits.

v2: Use helpers for one more call site and add review tag (Steven).
