KVM: MMU: pass kvm_mmu_page struct to make_spte

The level and A/D bit support of the new SPTE can be found in the role,
which is stored in the kvm_mmu_page struct.  This merges two arguments
into one.

For the TDP MMU, the kvm_mmu_page was not used (kvm_tdp_mmu_map does
not use it if the SPTE is already present) so we fetch it just before
calling make_spte.
