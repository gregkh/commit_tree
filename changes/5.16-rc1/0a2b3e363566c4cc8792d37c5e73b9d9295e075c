bcache: reserve never used bits from bkey.high

There sre 3 bits in member high of struct bkey are never used, and no
plan to support them in future,
- HEADER_SIZE, start at bit 58, length 2 bits
- KEY_PINNED,  start at bit 55, length 1 bit

No any kernel code, or user space tool references or accesses the three
bits. Therefore it is possible and feasible to reserve the valuable bits
from bkey.high. They can be used in future for other purpose.
