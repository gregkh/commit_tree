fuse: add cache_mask

If writeback_cache is enabled, then the size, mtime and ctime attributes of
regular files are always valid in the kernel's cache.  They are retrieved
from userspace only when the inode is freshly looked up.

Add a more generic "cache_mask", that indicates which attributes are
currently valid in cache.

This patch doesn't change behavior.
