kprobes: convert tests to kunit

This converts the kprobes testcases to use the kunit framework.
It adds a dependency on CONFIG_KUNIT, and the output will change
to TAP:

TAP version 14
1..1
    # Subtest: kprobes_test
    1..4
random: crng init done
    ok 1 - test_kprobe
    ok 2 - test_kprobes
    ok 3 - test_kretprobe
    ok 4 - test_kretprobes
ok 1 - kprobes_test

Note that the kprobes testcases are no longer run immediately after
kprobes initialization, but as a late initcall when kunit is
initialized. kprobes itself is initialized with an early initcall,
so the order is still correct.
