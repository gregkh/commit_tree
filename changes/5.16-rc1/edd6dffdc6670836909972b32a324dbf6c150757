ASoC: cs42l42: Use two thresholds and increased wait time for manual type detection

Some headsets require very different comparator thresholds for type detection,
as well as longer settling times. In order to detect a larger number of headsets,
use 2 thresholds to give maximum coverage (1.25V and 1.75V), as well as a longer
settling time of 100ms. This will not affect default audotodetect mode
and applies to manual mode type detection only.
