PCI: aardvark: Set PCI Bridge Class Code to PCI Bridge

Aardvark controller has something like config space of a Root Port
available at offset 0x0 of internal registers - these registers are used
for implementation of the emulated bridge.

The default value of Class Code of this bridge corresponds to a RAID Mass
storage controller, though. (This is probably intended for when the
controller is used as Endpoint.)

Change the Class Code to correspond to a PCI Bridge.

Add comment explaining this change.
