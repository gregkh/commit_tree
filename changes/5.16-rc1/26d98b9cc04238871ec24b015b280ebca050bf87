ABI: sysfs-platform-dell-privacy-wmi: correct ABI entries

As described at Documentation/ABI/README doesn't contain an
Attribute: field.

The way sysfs ABI is supposed to work is that each different
attribute would have a separate file. So, the right way to
map this would be like:

	/sys/.../dell_privacy_supported_type/mic_mute
	/sys/.../dell_privacy_supported_type/camera_shutter

	/sys/.../dell_privacy_current_state/mic_mute
	/sys/.../dell_privacy_current_state/camera_shutter

However, it seems to late to fix that, as this was merged already on
Kernel 5.13, and a change right now would be a regression.

So, instead, let's at least fix the entry to match the expected
format.

While here, fix the format of the contact, which is not a valid
e-mail URL.

This should also fix the current warnings produced when building the
docs:

	Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform-dell-privacy-wmi:35: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
	Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform-dell-privacy-wmi:2: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
