power: supply: bq25890: Fix race causing oops at boot

Before this commit the driver was registering its interrupt handler before
it registered the power_supply, causing bq->charger to potentially be NULL
when the interrupt handler runs, triggering a NULL pointer exception in
the interrupt handler:

Fix this by moving the power_supply_register() call to above the
request_threaded_irq() call.

Note this fix includes making the following 2 (necessary) changes:

1. Switch to the devm version of power_supply_register() to avoid the
need to make the error-handling in probe() more complicated.

2. Rename the "irq_fail" label to "err_unregister_usb_notifier" since
the old name no longer makes sense after this fix.
