memstick: mspro_block: Add error handling support for add_disk()

We never checked for errors on add_disk() as this function returned void.
Now that this is fixed, use the shiny new error handling.

Contrary to the typical removal which delays the put_disk() until later,
since we are failing on a probe we immediately put the disk on failure from
add_disk by using blk_cleanup_disk().
