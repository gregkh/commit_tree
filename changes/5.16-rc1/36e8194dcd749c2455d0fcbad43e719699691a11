KVM: x86: SVM: don't set VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts on vCPU reset

Commit adc2a23734ac ("KVM: nSVM: improve SYSENTER emulation on AMD"),
made init_vmcb set vmload/vmsave intercepts unconditionally,
and relied on svm_vcpu_after_set_cpuid to clear them when possible.

However init_vmcb is also called when the vCPU is reset, and it is
not followed by another call to svm_vcpu_after_set_cpuid because
the CPUID is already set.  This mistake makes the VMSAVE/VMLOAD intercept
to be set when it is not needed, and harms performance of the nested
guest.

Extract the relevant parts of svm_vcpu_after_set_cpuid so that they
can be called again on reset.
