perf tools: Allow controlling synthesizing PERF_RECORD_ metadata events during record

Depending on the use case, it might require some kind of synthesizing
and some not.  Make it controllable to turn off heavy operations like
MMAP for all tasks.

Currently all users are converted to enable all the synthesis by
default.  It'll be updated in the later patch.
