mmc: sdhci-omap: Check MMCHS_HL_HWINFO register for ADMA

ADMA is only available on controller instances that are connected to the
L3 interconnect and are bus mastering capable.

As the MMCHS_HL_HWINFO is in the module registers before omap registers
and sdhci registers, and the omap registers and sdhci registers can be
at different offsets depending on the SoC, let's read MMCHS_HL_HWINFO
directly.

Let's also switch to using device_property_present() while at it.
