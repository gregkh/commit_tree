bpftool: Switch to libbpf's hashmap for programs/maps in BTF listing

In order to show BPF programs and maps using BTF objects when the latter
are being listed, bpftool creates hash maps to store all relevant items.
This commit is part of a set that transitions from the kernel's hash map
implementation to the one coming with libbpf.

The motivation is to make bpftool less dependent of kernel headers, to
ease the path to a potential out-of-tree mirror, like libbpf has.

This commit focuses on the two hash maps used by bpftool when listing
BTF objects to store references to programs and maps, and convert them
to the libbpf's implementation.
