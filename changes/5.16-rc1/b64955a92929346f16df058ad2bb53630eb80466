cxl/mbox: Introduce the mbox_send operation

In preparation for implementing a unit test backend transport for ioctl
operations, and making the mailbox available to the cxl/pmem
infrastructure, move the existing PCI specific portion of mailbox handling
to an "mbox_send" operation.

With this split all the PCI-specific transport details are comprehended
by a single operation and the rest of the mailbox infrastructure is
'struct cxl_mem' and 'struct cxl_memdev' generic.
