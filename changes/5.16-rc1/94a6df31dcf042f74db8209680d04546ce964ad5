ath11k: Add wmi peer create conf event in wmi_tlv_event_id

When the driver sends a peer create cmd, the firmware responds with
WMI_PEER_CREATE_CONF_EVENTID to confirm the firmware received
WMI_PEER_CREATE_CMDID. Since the peer create conf event is not handled
in ath11k_wmi_tlv_op_rx, we are getting unknown event id warning prints
during peer creation.

Add WMI_PEER_CREATE_CONF_EVENTID in wmi_tlv_event_id and handle
the same as unsupported event id under wmi logs.

warning prints:
[ 4382.230817] ath11k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unknown eventid: 0x601a
