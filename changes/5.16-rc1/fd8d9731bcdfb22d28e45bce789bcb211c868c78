net: phylink: avoid mvneta warning when setting pause parameters

mvneta does not support asymetric pause modes, and it flags this by the
lack of AsymPause in the supported field. When setting pause modes, we
check that pause->rx_pause == pause->tx_pause, but only when pause
autoneg is enabled. When pause autoneg is disabled, we still allow
pause->rx_pause != pause->tx_pause, which is incorrect when the MAC
does not support asymetric pause, and causes mvneta to issue a warning.

Fix this by removing the test for pause->autoneg, so we always check
that pause->rx_pause == pause->tx_pause for network devices that do not
support AsymPause.
