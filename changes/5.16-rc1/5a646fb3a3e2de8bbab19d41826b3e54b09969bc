coda: avoid doing bad things on inode type changes during revalidation

When Coda discovers an inconsistent object, it turns it into a symlink.
However we can't just follow this change in the kernel on an existing file
or directory inode that may still have references.

This patch removes the inconsistent inode from the inode hash and
allocates a new inode for the symlink object.
