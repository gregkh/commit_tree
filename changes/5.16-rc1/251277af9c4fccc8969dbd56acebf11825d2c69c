atmel: use eth_hw_addr_set()

Commit 406f42fa0d3c ("net-next: When a bond have a massive amount
of VLANs...") introduced a rbtree for faster Ethernet address look
up. To maintain netdev->dev_addr in this tree we need to make all
the writes to it got through appropriate helpers.

Use a buffer on the stack. Note that atmel_get_mib() is a wrapper
around atmel_copy_to_host(). For the to device direction we just
need to make sure functions respect argument being cost.
