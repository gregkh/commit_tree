NFS: Default change_attr_type to NFS4_CHANGE_TYPE_IS_UNDEFINED

Both NFSv3 and NFSv2 generate their change attribute from the ctime
value that was supplied by the server. However the problem is that there
are plenty of servers out there with ctime resolutions of 1ms or worse.
In a modern performance system, this is insufficient when trying to
decide which is the most recent set of attributes when, for instance, a
READ or GETATTR call races with a WRITE or SETATTR.

For this reason, let's revert to labelling the NFSv2/v3 change
attributes as NFS4_CHANGE_TYPE_IS_UNDEFINED. This will ensure we protect
against such races.
