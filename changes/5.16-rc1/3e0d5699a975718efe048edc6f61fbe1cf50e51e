net: stmmac: fix gcc-10 -Wrestrict warning

gcc-10 and later warn about a theoretical array overrun when
accessing priv->int_name_rx_irq[i] with an out of bounds value
of 'i':

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c: In function 'stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi':
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:3528:17: error: 'snprintf' argument 4 may overlap destination object 'dev' [-Werror=restrict]
 3528 |                 snprintf(int_name, int_name_len, "%s:%s-%d", dev->name, "tx", i);
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:3404:60: note: destination object referenced by 'restrict'-qualified argument 1 was declared here
 3404 | static int stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi(struct net_device *dev)
      |                                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~

The warning is a bit strange since it's not actually about the array
bounds but rather about possible string operations with overlapping
arguments, but it's not technically wrong.

Avoid the warning by adding an extra bounds check.
