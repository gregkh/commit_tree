media: mceusb: return without resubmitting URB in case of -EPROTO error.

Syzkaller reported a warning called "rcu detected stall in dummy_timer".

The error seems to be an error in mceusb_dev_recv(). In the case of
-EPROTO error, the routine immediately resubmits the URB. Instead it
should return without resubmitting URB.
