scsi: sd: Add error handling support for add_disk()

We never checked for errors on add_disk() as this function returned
void. Now that this is fixed, use the shiny new error handling.

As with the error handling for device_add() we follow the same logic and
just put the device so that cleanup is done via the scsi_disk_release().
