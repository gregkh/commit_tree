xfs: fix maxlevels comparisons in the btree staging code

The btree geometry computation function has an off-by-one error in that
it does not allow maximally tall btrees (nlevels == XFS_BTREE_MAXLEVELS).
This can result in repairs failing unnecessarily on very fragmented
filesystems.  Subsequent patches to remove MAXLEVELS usage in favor of
the per-btree type computations will make this a much more likely
occurrence.
