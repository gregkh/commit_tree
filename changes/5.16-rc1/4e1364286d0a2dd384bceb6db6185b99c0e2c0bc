mm/filemap: Add folio_unlock()

Convert unlock_page() to call folio_unlock().  By using a folio we
avoid a call to compound_head().  This shortens the function from 39
bytes to 25 and removes 4 instructions on x86-64.  Because we still
have unlock_page(), it's a net increase of 16 bytes of text for the
kernel as a whole, but any path that uses folio_unlock() will execute
4 fewer instructions.
