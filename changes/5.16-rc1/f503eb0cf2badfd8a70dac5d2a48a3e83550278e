drm/i915/selftests: fixup igt_shrink_thp

Since the object might still be active here, the shrink_all will simply
ignore it, which blows up in the test, since the pages will still be
there. Currently THP is disabled which should result in the test being
skipped, but if we ever re-enable THP we might start seeing the failure.
Fix this by forcing I915_SHRINK_ACTIVE.

v2: Some machine in the shard runs doesn't seem to have any available
swap when running this test. Try to handle this.
