xfs: don't allocate scrub contexts on the stack

Convert the on-stack scrub context, btree scrub context, and da btree
scrub context into a heap allocation so that we reduce stack usage and
gain the ability to handle tall btrees without issue.

Specifically, this saves us ~208 bytes for the dabtree scrub, ~464 bytes
for the btree scrub, and ~200 bytes for the main scrub context.
