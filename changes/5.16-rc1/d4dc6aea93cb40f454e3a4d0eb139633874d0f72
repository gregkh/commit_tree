scsi: smartpqi: Fix duplicate device nodes for tape changers

Stop the OS from re-discovering multiple LUNs for tape drive and medium
changer.

Duplicate device nodes for Ultrium tape drive and medium changer are being
created.

The Ultrium tape drive is a multi-LUN SCSI target.  It presents a LUN for
the tape drive and a 2nd LUN for the medium changer.  Our controller FW
lists both LUNs in the RPL results.

As a result, the smartpqi driver exposes both devices to the OS. Then the
OS does its normal device discovery via the SCSI REPORT LUNS command, which
causes it to re-discover both devices a 2nd time, which results in the
duplicate device nodes.
