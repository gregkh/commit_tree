USB: serial: kl5kusb105: use usb_control_msg_recv() and usb_control_msg_send()

The wrappers usb_control_msg_send/recv eliminate the need of manually
allocating DMA buffers for USB messages. They also treat short reads as
an error. Hence use the wrappers and remove DMA allocations.

Note that short reads are now logged as -EREMOTEIO instead of the amount
of data read.
