ABI: sysfs-bus-rapidio: use wildcards on What definitions

While humans may be able to understand that something like:

	/sys/bus/rapidio/devices/nn:d:iiii

could actually mean:

	/sys/bus/rapidio/devices/00:e:0000

This is something that computers can't easily identify. As
get_abi.pl needs to convert it into a regex, change What: lines
to:

	/sys/bus/rapidio/devices/<nn>:<d>:<iiii>

Which is the commonly-used pattern on ABI files for wildcards.
