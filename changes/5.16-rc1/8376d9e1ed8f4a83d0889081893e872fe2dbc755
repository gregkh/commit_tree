btrfs: zoned: finish superblock zone once no space left for new SB

If there is no more space left for a new superblock in a superblock zone,
then it is better to ZONE_FINISH the zone and frees up the active zone
count.

Since btrfs_advance_sb_log() can now issue REQ_OP_ZONE_FINISH, we also need
to convert it to return int for the error case.
