tty: n_gsm: Modify gsmtty driver register method when config requester

As requester,because n_gsm has no uevent report for application,the
application can't know dlci connect or disconnect.

The application will control every dlcl dev by uevent,when application
receive gsmtty0 dev remove uevent,it will close mux function,and change to
normal mode.

Example:

Before modify:

gsmld receive DLC0 DISC,no event report to application
gsmld receive DLC1 SABM,no event report to application
gsmld receive DLC1 DISC,no event report to application

After modify:

Receive DLC0 DISC,report "/devices/virtual/tty/gsmtty0" remove uevent

Receive DLC1 SABM,report "/devices/virtual/tty/gsmtty1" add uevent
Receive DLC1 DISC,report "/devices/virtual/tty/gsmtty1" remove uevent
