crypto: qat - simplify adf_enable_aer()

A struct pci_driver is shared across all device instances, so assigning
pci_driver.err_handler once per device isn't really sensible.

Set adf_driver.err_handler statically instead of in adf_enable_aer().
This removes a use of pci_dev->driver, which is a step toward removing
pci_dev->driver altogether.

Since adf_enable_aer() returns zero unconditionally, make it a void
function.
