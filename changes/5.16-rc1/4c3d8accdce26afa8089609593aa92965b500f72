usb: remove res2 argument from gadget code completions

The USB gadget code is the only code that every tried to utilize the
2nd argument of the aio completions, but there are strong suspicions
that it was never actually used by anything on the userspace side.

Out of the 3 cases that touch it, two of them just pass in the same
as res, and the last one passes in error/transfer in res like any
other normal use case.

Remove the 2nd argument, pass 0 like the rest of the in-kernel users
of kiocb based IO.
