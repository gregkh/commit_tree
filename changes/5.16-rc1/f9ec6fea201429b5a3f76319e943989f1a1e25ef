sched/topology: Remove unused numa_distance in cpu_attach_domain()

numa_distance in cpu_attach_domain() is introduced in
commit b5b217346de8 ("sched/topology: Warn when NUMA diameter > 2")
to warn user when NUMA diameter > 2 as we'll misrepresent
the scheduler topology structures at that time. This is
fixed by Barry in commit 585b6d2723dc ("sched/topology: fix the issue
groups don't span domain->span for NUMA diameter > 2") and
numa_distance is unused now. So remove it.
