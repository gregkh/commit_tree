lkdtm/bugs: Check that a per-task stack canary exists

Introduce REPORT_STACK_CANARY to check for differing stack canaries
between two processes (i.e. that an architecture is correctly implementing
per-task stack canaries), using the task_struct canary as the hint to
locate in the stack. Requires that one of the processes being tested
not be pid 1.
