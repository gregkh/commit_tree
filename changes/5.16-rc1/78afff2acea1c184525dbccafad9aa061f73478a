drm/bochs: add Bochs PCI ID for Simics model

Current (and older) Simics models for the Bochs VGA used the wrong PCI
vendor ID (0x4321 instead of 0x1234).  Although this can hopefully be
fixed in the future, it is a problem for users of the current version,
not the least because to update the device ID the BIOS has to be
rebuilt in order to see BIOS output.

Add support for the 4321:1111 device number in addition to the
1234:1111 one.
