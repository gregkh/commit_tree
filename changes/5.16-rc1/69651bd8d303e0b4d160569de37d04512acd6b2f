soc: fsl: dpio: add Net DIM integration

Use the generic dynamic interrupt moderation (dim) framework to
implement adaptive interrupt coalescing on Rx. With the per-packet
interrupt scheme, a high interrupt rate has been noted for moderate
traffic flows leading to high CPU utilization.

The dpio driver exports new functions to enable/disable adaptive IRQ
coalescing on a DPIO object, to query the state or to update Net DIM
with a new set of bytes and frames dequeued.
