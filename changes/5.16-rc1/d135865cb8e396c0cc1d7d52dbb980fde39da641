drm/i915/guc: Copy whole golden context, set engine state size of subset

When the GuC does a media reset, it copies a golden context state back
into the corrupted context's state. The address of the golden context
and the size of the engine state restore are passed in via the GuC ADS.
The i915 had a bug where it passed in the whole size of the golden
context, not the size of the engine state to restore resulting in a
memory corruption.

Also copy the entire golden context on init rather than just the engine
state that is restored.

v2 (Daniele): use defines to avoid duplicated const variables (John).
