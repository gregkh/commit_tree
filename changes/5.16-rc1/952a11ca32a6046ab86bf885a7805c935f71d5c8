hwmon: cleanup non-bool "valid" data fields

We have bool so use it consistently in all the drivers.

The following Coccinelle script was used:

@@
identifier T;
type t = { char, int };
@@
struct T {
...
-	t valid;
+	bool valid;
...
}

@@
identifier v;
@@
(
- v->valid = 0
+ v->valid = false
|
- v->valid = 1
+ v->valid = true
)

followed by sed to fixup the comments:
sed '/bool valid;/{s/!=0/true/;s/zero/false/}'

Few whitespace changes were fixed manually. All modified drivers were
compile-tested.
