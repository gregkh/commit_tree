net: udp: correct the document for udp_mem

udp_mem is a vector of 3 INTEGERs, which is used to limit the number of
pages allowed for queueing by all UDP sockets.

However, sk_has_memory_pressure() in __sk_mem_raise_allocated() always
return false for udp, as memory pressure is not supported by udp, which
means that __sk_mem_raise_allocated() will fail once pages allocated
for udp socket exceeds udp_mem[0].

Therefor, udp_mem[0] is the only one that limit the number of pages.
However, the document of udp_mem just express that udp_mem[2] is the
limitation. So, just fix it.
