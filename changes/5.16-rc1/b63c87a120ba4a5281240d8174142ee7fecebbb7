dt-bindings: bus: ti-sysc: Update to use yaml binding

Update the binding for ti-sysc interconnect target module driver to yaml
format.

Note that the old binding was never updated for the need to always specify
also the generic compatible "ti,sysc". This is needed for the auxdata
for platform clockdomain autoidle related functions.
