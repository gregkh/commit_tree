fanotify: Split fsid check from other fid mode checks

FAN_FS_ERROR will require fsid, but not necessarily require the
filesystem to expose a file handle.  Split those checks into different
functions, so they can be used separately when setting up an event.

While there, update a comment about tmpfs having 0 fsid, which is no
longer true.
