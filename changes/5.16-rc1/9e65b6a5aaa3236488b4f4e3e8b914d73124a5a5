mptcp: remove tx_pending_data

The update on recovery is not correct.

msk->tx_pending_data += msk->snd_nxt - rtx_head->data_seq;

will update tx_pending_data multiple times when a subflow is declared
stale while earlier recovery is still in progress.
This means that tx_pending_data will still be positive even after
all data as has been transmitted.

Rather than fix it, remove this field: there are no consumers.
The outstanding data byte count can be computed either via

 "msk->write_seq - rtx_head->data_seq" or
 "msk->write_seq - msk->snd_una".

The latter is more recent/accurate estimate as rtx_head adjustment
is deferred until mptcp lock can be acquired.
