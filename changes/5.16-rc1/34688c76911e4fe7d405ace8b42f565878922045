arm64: vdso: remove -nostdlib compiler flag

The -nostdlib option requests the compiler to not use the standard
system startup files or libraries when linking. It is effective only
when $(CC) is used as a linker driver.

Since commit 691efbedc60d ("arm64: vdso: use $(LD) instead of $(CC)
to link VDSO"), $(LD) is directly used, hence -nostdlib is unneeded.
