locking: Remove spin_lock_flags() etc

parisc, ia64 and powerpc32 are the only remaining architectures that
provide custom arch_{spin,read,write}_lock_flags() functions, which are
meant to re-enable interrupts while waiting for a spinlock.

However, none of these can actually run into this codepath, because
it is only called on architectures without CONFIG_GENERIC_LOCKBREAK,
or when CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is set without CONFIG_LOCKDEP, and none
of those combinations are possible on the three architectures.

Going back in the git history, it appears that arch/mn10300 may have
been able to run into this code path, but there is a good chance that
it never worked. On the architectures that still exist, it was
already impossible to hit back in 2008 after the introduction of
CONFIG_GENERIC_LOCKBREAK, and possibly earlier.

As this is all dead code, just remove it and the helper functions built
around it. For arch/ia64, the inline asm could be cleaned up, but
it seems safer to leave it untouched.
