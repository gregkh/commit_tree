smackfs: use __GFP_NOFAIL for smk_cipso_doi()

syzbot is reporting kernel panic at smk_cipso_doi() due to memory
allocation fault injection [1]. The reason for need to use panic() was
not explained. But since no fix was proposed for 18 months, for now
let's use __GFP_NOFAIL for utilizing syzbot resource on other bugs.
