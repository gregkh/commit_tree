dt-bindings: Remove Netlogic bindings

Support for Netlogic was removed in commit 95b8a5e0111a ("MIPS: Remove
NETLOGIC support"). Remove the now unused bindings.

The GPIO binding also includes "brcm,vulcan-gpio", but it appears to be
unused as well as Broadcom Vulkan became Cavium ThunderX2 which is ACPI
based.
