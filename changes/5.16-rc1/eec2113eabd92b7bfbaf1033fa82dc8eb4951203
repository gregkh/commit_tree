x86/fpu/amx: Define AMX state components and have it used for boot-time checks

The XSTATE initialization uses check_xstate_against_struct() to sanity
check the size of XSTATE-enabled features. AMX is a XSAVE-enabled feature,
and its size is not hard-coded but discoverable at run-time via CPUID.

The AMX state is composed of state components 17 and 18, which are all user
state components. The first component is the XTILECFG state of a 64-byte
tile-related control register. The state component 18, called XTILEDATA,
contains the actual tile data, and the state size varies on
implementations. The architectural maximum, as defined in the CPUID(0x1d,
1): EAX[15:0], is a byte less than 64KB. The first implementation supports
8KB.

Check the XTILEDATA state size dynamically. The feature introduces the new
tile register, TMM. Define one register struct only and read the number of
registers from CPUID. Cross-check the overall size with CPUID again.
