watchdog: f71808e_wdt: refactor to platform device/driver pair

Driver so far wasn't ported to the driver model and registered
the watchdog device out of the init after probing the I/O ports
for a watchdog with correct vendor and device revision.

Keep the device detection part at init time, but move watchdog
registration to a platform driver probe function.
