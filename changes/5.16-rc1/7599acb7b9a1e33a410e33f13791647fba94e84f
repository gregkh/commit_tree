Revert "ALSA: memalloc: Convert x86 SG-buffer handling with non-contiguous type"

This reverts commit 2d9ea39917a4e4293bc2caea902c7059a330b611.

We've got a regression report showing that the audio got broken the
device over AMD IOMMU.  The conversion assumed the wrong pointer /
page mapping for the indirect mapping case, and we need to correct
this urgently, so let's revert it for now.
