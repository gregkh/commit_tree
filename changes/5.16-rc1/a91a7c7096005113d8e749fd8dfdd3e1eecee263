KVM: X86: Don't reset mmu context when toggling X86_CR4_PGE

X86_CR4_PGE doesn't participate in kvm_mmu_role, so the mmu context
doesn't need to be reset.  It is only required to flush all the guest
tlb.

It is also inconsistent that X86_CR4_PGE is in KVM_MMU_CR4_ROLE_BITS
while kvm_mmu_role doesn't use X86_CR4_PGE.  So X86_CR4_PGE is also
removed from KVM_MMU_CR4_ROLE_BITS.
