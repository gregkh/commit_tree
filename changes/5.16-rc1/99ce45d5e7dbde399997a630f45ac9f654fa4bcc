mctp: Implement extended addressing

This change allows an extended address struct - struct sockaddr_mctp_ext
- to be passed to sendmsg/recvmsg. This allows userspace to specify
output ifindex and physical address information (for sendmsg) or receive
the input ifindex/physaddr for incoming messages (for recvmsg). This is
typically used by userspace for MCTP address discovery and assignment
operations.

The extended addressing facility is conditional on a new sockopt:
MCTP_OPT_ADDR_EXT; userspace must explicitly enable addressing before
the kernel will consume/populate the extended address data.

Includes a fix for an uninitialised var:
