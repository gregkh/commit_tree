scsi: ufs: Revert "Retry aborted SCSI commands instead of completing these successfully"

Commit 73dc3c4ac703 ("scsi: ufs: Retry aborted SCSI commands instead of
completing these successfully") is not necessary. If a SCSI command is
aborted successfully the UFS controller has not modified the command status
and the command status still has the value assigned by
ufshcd_prepare_req_desc_hdr(), namely OCS_INVALID_COMMAND_STATUS. The
function ufshcd_transfer_rsp_status() requeues commands that have an
invalid command status. Hence revert commit 73dc3c4ac703.
