arm64: dts: rockchip: Disable CDN DP on Pinebook Pro

The CDN DP needs a PHY and a extcon to work correctly. But no extcon is
provided by the device-tree, which leads to an error:
cdn-dp fec00000.dp: [drm:cdn_dp_probe [rockchipdrm]] *ERROR* missing extcon or phy
cdn-dp: probe of fec00000.dp failed with error -22

Disable the CDN DP to make graphic work on the Pinebook Pro.
