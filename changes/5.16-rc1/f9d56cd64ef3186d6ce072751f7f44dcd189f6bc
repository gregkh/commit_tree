drm/i915: Make shadow tables range-based

Rather than defining our shadow tables as a list of individual
registers, provide them as a list of register ranges; we'll have some
ranges of multiple registers being added soon (and we already have a
couple adjacent registers that we can squash into a single range now).

This change also defines the table with hex literal values rather than
symbolic register names; since that's how the tables are defined in the
bspec, this change will make it easier to review the tables overall.

v2:
 - Force signed comparison on range overlap sanity check
