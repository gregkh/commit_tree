ASoC: es8316: Use IRQF_NO_AUTOEN when requesting the IRQ

Use the new IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag when requesting the IRQ, rather then
disabling it immediately after requesting it.

This fixes a possible race where the IRQ might trigger between requesting
and disabling it; and this also leads to a small code cleanup.
