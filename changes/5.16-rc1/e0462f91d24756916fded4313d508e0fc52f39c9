inotify: Don't force FS_IN_IGNORED

According to Amir:

"FS_IN_IGNORED is completely internal to inotify and there is no need
to set it in i_fsnotify_mask at all, so if we remove the bit from the
output of inotify_arg_to_mask() no functionality will change and we will
be able to overload the event bit for FS_ERROR."

This is done in preparation to overload FS_ERROR with the notification
mechanism in fanotify.
