vfio: remove the iommudata check in vfio_noiommu_attach_group

vfio_noiommu_attach_group has two callers:

 1) __vfio_container_attach_groups is called by vfio_ioctl_set_iommu,
    which just called vfio_iommu_driver_allowed
 2) vfio_group_set_container requires already checks ->noiommu on the
    vfio_group, which is propagated from the iommudata in
    vfio_create_group

so this check is entirely superflous and can be removed.
