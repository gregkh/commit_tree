cxl/pmem: Translate NVDIMM label commands to CXL label commands

The LIBNVDIMM IOCTL UAPI calls back to the nvdimm-bus-provider to
translate the Linux command payload to the device native command format.
The LIBNVDIMM commands get-config-size, get-config-data, and
set-config-data, map to the CXL memory device commands device-identify,
get-lsa, and set-lsa. Recall that the label-storage-area (LSA) on an
NVDIMM device arranges for the provisioning of namespaces. Additionally
for CXL the LSA is used for provisioning regions as well.

The data from device-identify is already cached in the 'struct cxl_mem'
instance associated with @cxl_nvd, so that payload return is simply
crafted and no CXL command is issued. The conversion for get-lsa is
straightforward, but the conversion for set-lsa requires an allocation
to append the set-lsa header in front of the payload.
