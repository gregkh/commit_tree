RISC-V: KVM: Add timer functionality

The RISC-V hypervisor specification doesn't have any virtual timer
feature.

Due to this, the guest VCPU timer will be programmed via SBI calls.
The host will use a separate hrtimer event for each guest VCPU to
provide timer functionality. We inject a virtual timer interrupt to
the guest VCPU whenever the guest VCPU hrtimer event expires.

This patch adds guest VCPU timer implementation along with ONE_REG
interface to access VCPU timer state from user space.
