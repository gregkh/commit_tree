PCI: qcom-ep: Add Qualcomm PCIe Endpoint controller driver

Add driver for Qualcomm PCIe Endpoint controller based on the DesignWare
core with added Qualcomm-specific wrapper around the core. The driver
support is very basic such that it supports only enumeration, PCIe
read/write, and MSI. There is no ASPM and PM support for now but these will
be added later.

The driver is capable of using the PERST# and WAKE# side-band GPIOs for
operation and written on top of the DWC PCI framework.
