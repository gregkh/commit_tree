at24: Support probing while in non-zero ACPI D state

In certain use cases (where the chip is part of a camera module, and the
camera module is wired together with a camera privacy LED), powering on
the device during probe is undesirable. Add support for the at24 to
execute probe while being in ACPI D state other than 0 (which means fully
powered on).
