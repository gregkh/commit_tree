gve: Implement packet continuation for RX.

This enables the driver to receive RX packets spread across multiple
buffers:

For a given multi-fragment packet the "packet continuation" bit is set
on all descriptors except the last one. These descriptors' payloads are
combined into a single SKB before the SKB is handed to the
networking stack.

This change adds a "packet buffer size" notion for RX queues. The
CreateRxQueue AdminQueue command sent to the device now includes the
packet_buffer_size.

We opt for a packet_buffer_size of PAGE_SIZE / 2 to give the
driver the opportunity to flip pages where we can instead of copying.
