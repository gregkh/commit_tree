PCI/MSI: Destroy sysfs before freeing entries

free_msi_irqs() frees the MSI entries before destroying the sysfs entries
which are exposing them. Nothing prevents a concurrent free while a sysfs
file is read and accesses the possibly freed entry.

Move the sysfs release ahead of freeing the entries.
