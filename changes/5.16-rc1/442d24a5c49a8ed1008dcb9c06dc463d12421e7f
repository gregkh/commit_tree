cpufreq: Add an interface to mark inefficient frequencies

Some SoCs such as the sd855 have OPPs within the same policy whose cost is
higher than others with a higher frequency. Those OPPs are inefficients
and it might be interesting for a governor to not use them.

cpufreq_table_set_inefficient() allows the caller to identify a specified
frequency as being inefficient. Inefficient frequencies are only supported
on sorted tables.
