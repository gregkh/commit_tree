ALSA: usb-audio: Disable low-latency mode for implicit feedback sync

When a playback stream runs in the implicit feedback mode, its
operation is passive and won't start unless the capture packet is
received.  This behavior contradicts with the low-latency playback
mode, and we should turn off lowlatency_playback flag accordingly.

In theory, we may take the low-latency mode when the playback-first
quirk is set, but it still conflicts with the later operation with the
fixed packet numbers, so it's disabled all together for now.
