usb:gadget: f_uac1: fixed sync playback

The u_audio param fb_max was not set to its default value in f_uac1.c.
As a result the maximum value of Playback Pitch ctl was kept at 1000000,
not allowing to set faster playback pitch for UAC1.

The setting required moving the default constant UAC2_DEF_FB_MAX from
u_uac2.h to FBACK_FAST_MAX in u_audio.h as that header is common for
f_uac1.c and f_uac2.c.
