kfence: always use static branches to guard kfence_alloc()

Regardless of KFENCE mode (CONFIG_KFENCE_STATIC_KEYS: either using
static keys to gate allocations, or using a simple dynamic branch),
always use a static branch to avoid the dynamic branch in kfence_alloc()
if KFENCE was disabled at boot.

For CONFIG_KFENCE_STATIC_KEYS=n, this now avoids the dynamic branch if
KFENCE was disabled at boot.

To simplify, also unifies the location where kfence_allocation_gate is
read-checked to just be inline in kfence_alloc().
