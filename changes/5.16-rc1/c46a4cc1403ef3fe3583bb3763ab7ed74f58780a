drm/panel-edp: hpd_reliable shouldn't be subtraced from hpd_absent

Now that the delays are named / described with eDP-centric names, it
becomes clear that we should really specify the "hpd_reliable" and
"hpd_absent" separately without taking the other into account. Let's
fix it.

This should be a no-op change and just adjust how we specify
things. The actual delays should be the same before and after for the
one panel that currently species both "hpd_reliable" and "hpd_absent".
