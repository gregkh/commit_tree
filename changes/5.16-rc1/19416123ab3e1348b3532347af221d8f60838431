block: define 'struct bvec_iter' as packed

'struct bvec_iter' is embedded into 'struct bio', define it as packed
so that we can get one extra 4bytes for other uses without expanding
bio.

'struct bvec_iter' is often allocated on stack, so making it packed
doesn't affect performance. Also I have run io_uring on both
nvme/null_blk, and not observe performance effect in this way.
