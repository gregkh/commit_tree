drm/i915/dg2: use existing mechanisms for SNPS PHY translations

We use encoder->get_buf_trans() in many places, for example
intel_ddi_dp_voltage_max(), and the hook was set to some old platform's
function for DG2 SNPS PHY. Convert SNPS PHY to use the same translation
mechanisms as everything else.
