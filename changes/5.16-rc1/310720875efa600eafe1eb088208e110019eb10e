ARM: configs: Everyone who had PANEL_SIMPLE now gets PANEL_EDP

In the patch ("drm/panel-simple-edp: Split eDP panels out of
panel-simple") we will split the PANEL_SIMPLE driver in two. By
default let's give everyone who had the old driver enabled the new
driver too. If folks want to opt-out of one or the other they always
can later.
