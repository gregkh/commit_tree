btrfs: rename btrfs_bio to btrfs_io_context

The structure btrfs_bio is used by two different sites:

- bio->bi_private for mirror based profiles
  For those profiles (SINGLE/DUP/RAID1*/RAID10), this structures records
  how many mirrors are still pending, and save the original endio
  function of the bio.

- RAID56 code
  In that case, RAID56 only utilize the stripes info, and no long uses
  that to trace the pending mirrors.

So btrfs_bio is not always bind to a bio, and contains more info for IO
context, thus renaming it will make the naming less confusing.
