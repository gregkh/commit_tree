blk-crypto: rename keyslot-manager files to blk-crypto-profile

In preparation for renaming struct blk_keyslot_manager to struct
blk_crypto_profile, rename the keyslot-manager.h and keyslot-manager.c
source files.  Renaming these files separately before making a lot of
changes to their contents makes it easier for git to understand that
they were renamed.
