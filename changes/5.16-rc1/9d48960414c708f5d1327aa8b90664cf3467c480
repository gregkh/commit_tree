x86/microcode: Use the firmware_loader built-in API

The microcode loader has been looping through __start_builtin_fw down to
__end_builtin_fw to look for possibly built-in firmware for microcode
updates.

Now that the firmware loader code has exported an API for looping
through the kernel's built-in firmware section, use it and drop the x86
implementation in favor.
