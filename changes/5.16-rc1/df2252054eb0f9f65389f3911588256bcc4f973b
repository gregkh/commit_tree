perf test: Make each test/suite its own struct.

By switching to an array of pointers to tests (later to be suites)
the definition of the tests can be moved to the file containing the
tests.

Committer notes:

It's "&vectors_page", not "&vectors_pages", noticed when cross building
to 32-bit ARM.

Also the DEFINE_SUITE(vectors_page) should be done where its function is
implemented, in tools/perf/arch/arm/tests/vectors-page.c, so that we can
make it static, as we don't have anymore its declaration in tests.h.
