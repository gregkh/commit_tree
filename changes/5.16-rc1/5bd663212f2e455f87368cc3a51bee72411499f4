net: bareudp: fix duplicate checks of data[] expressions

Both !data[IFLA_BAREUDP_PORT] and !data[IFLA_BAREUDP_ETHERTYPE] are
checked.  We should remove the checks of data[IFLA_BAREUDP_PORT] and
data[IFLA_BAREUDP_ETHERTYPE] that follow since they are always true.

Put both statements together in group and balance the space on both
sides of '=' sign.
