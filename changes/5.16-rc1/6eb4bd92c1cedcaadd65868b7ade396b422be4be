kallsyms: strip LTO suffixes from static functions

Similar to:
commit 8b8e6b5d3b01 ("kallsyms: strip ThinLTO hashes from static
functions")

It's very common for compilers to modify the symbol name for static
functions as part of optimizing transformations. That makes hooking
static functions (that weren't inlined or DCE'd) with kprobes difficult.

LLVM has yet another name mangling scheme used by thin LTO.

Combine handling of the various schemes by truncating after the first
'.'.  Strip off these suffixes so that we can continue to hook such
static functions.  Clang releases prior to clang-13 would use '$'
instead of '.'
