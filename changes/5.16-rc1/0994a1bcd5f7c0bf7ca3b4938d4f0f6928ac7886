RDMA/rxe: Bump up default maximum values used via uverbs

In our internal testing we have found that default maximum values are too
small.  Ideally there should be no limits, but since maximum values are
reported via ibv_query_device, we have to return some value. So, the
default maximums have been changed to large values.
