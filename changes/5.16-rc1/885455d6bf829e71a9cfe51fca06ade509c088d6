drm/msm: Change dpu_crtc_get_vblank_counter to use vsync count.

[why]
vsync_cnt atomic counter increments for every hw vsync. On the other
hand, frame count is a register that increments when the frame gets
actually pushed out. We cannnot read this register whenever the timing
engine is off, but vblank counter should still return a valid number.
This behavior also matches the downstream driver.

[How]
Read the encoder vsync count instead of the dpu_encoder_phys frame
count.
