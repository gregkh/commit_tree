habanalabs: define uAPI to export FD for DMA-BUF

User process might want to share the device memory with another
driver/device, and to allow it to access it over PCIe (P2P).

To enable this, we utilize the dma-buf mechanism and add a dma-buf
exporter support, so the other driver can import the device memory and
access it.

The device memory is allocated using our existing allocation uAPI,
where the user will get a handle that represents the allocation.

The user will then need to call the new
uAPI (HL_MEM_OP_EXPORT_DMABUF_FD) and give the handle as a parameter.

The driver will return a FD that represents the DMA-BUF object that
was created to match that allocation.
