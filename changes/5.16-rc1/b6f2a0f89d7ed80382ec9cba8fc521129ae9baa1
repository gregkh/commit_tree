cifs: for compound requests, use open handle if possible

For smb2_compound_op, it is possible to pass a ref to
an already open file. We should be passing it whenever possible.
i.e. if a matching handle is already kept open.

If we don't do that, we will end up breaking leases for files
kept open on the same client.
