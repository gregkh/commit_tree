arm64: dts: qcom: pm660: Add reboot mode support

It turns out that the pm660 PON is a GEN2 device.  Update the compatible
to "qcom,pm8998-pon" and add reboot mode support, so that devices can be
rebooted into bootloader and recovery mode.  Tested on Xiaomi Redmi Note
7 phone.

While at it, drop the unnecessary newline between 'compatible' and 'reg'
property.
