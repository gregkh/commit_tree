io_uring: dump sqe contents if issue fails

I recently had to look at a production problem where a request ended
up getting the dreaded -EINVAL error on submit. The most used and
hence useless of error codes, as it just tells you that something
was wrong with your request, but not more than that.

Let's dump the full sqe contents if we run into an issue failure,
that'll allow easier diagnosing of a wide variety of issues.
