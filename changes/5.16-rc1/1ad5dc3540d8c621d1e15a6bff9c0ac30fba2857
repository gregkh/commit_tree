i2c: i801: Fix incorrect and needless software PEC disabling

Commit a6b8bb6a813a ("i2c: i801: Fix handling SMBHSTCNT_PEC_EN")
attempts to disable software PEC by clearing the SMBHSTCNT_PEC_EN (bit 7)
in the SMBus Host Control register (I/O SMBHSTCNT) but incorrectly
clears it in the PCI Host Configuration register (PCI SMBHSTCFG).

This clearing is actually needless since after above commit the
SMBHSTCNT_PEC_EN is never set and the register is initialized with known
values.
