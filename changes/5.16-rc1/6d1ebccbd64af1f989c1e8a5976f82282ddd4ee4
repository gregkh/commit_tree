IB/hfi1: Add ring consumer and producers traces

These traces are used to debugging ring issues.

The ipoib_txreq needed to be moved to a header file to allow access from
the trace header file.

The trace changes include:
- new producer/consumer traces
- new allocation deallocation traces
- additional fidelity for SDMA engine prints
