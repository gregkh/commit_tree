ASoC: wm_adsp: Separate generic cs_dsp_coeff_ctl handling

This is preparation for moving the generic DSP support out of ASoC. The
majority of the handling of firmware controls is generic and this change
separates the generic and ASoC specific details into separate structures
and functions and renames the generic code named wm_* to cs_*.
