btrfs: change handle_fs_error in recover_log_trees to aborts

During inspection of the return path for replay I noticed that we don't
actually abort the transaction if we get a failure during replay.  This
isn't a problem necessarily, as we properly return the error and will
fail to mount.  However we still leave this dangling transaction that
could conceivably be committed without thinking there was an error.

We were using btrfs_handle_fs_error() here, but that pre-dates the
transaction abort code.  Simply replace the btrfs_handle_fs_error()
calls with transaction aborts, so we still know where exactly things
went wrong, and add a few in some other un-handled error cases.
