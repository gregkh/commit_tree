libbpf: Resolve invalid weak kfunc calls with imm = 0, off = 0

Preserve these calls as it allows verifier to succeed in loading the
program if they are determined to be unreachable after dead code
elimination during program load. If not, the verifier will fail at
runtime. This is done for ext->is_weak symbols similar to the case for
variable ksyms.
