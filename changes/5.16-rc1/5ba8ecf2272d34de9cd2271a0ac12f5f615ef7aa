ASoC: rockchip: Use generic dmaengine code

This reverts commit 75b31192fe6ad20b42276b20ee3bdf1493216d63.

The original purpose of customized pcm was to config prealloc buffer size
flexibly. but, we can do the same thing by soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.

And the generic one can generated the better config by querying DMA
capabilities from dmaengine driver rather than the Hard-Coded one.

e.g.

the customized one:

  static const struct snd_pcm_hardware snd_rockchip_hardware = {
         .info                   = SNDRV_PCM_INFO_MMAP |
                                   SNDRV_PCM_INFO_MMAP_VALID |
                                   SNDRV_PCM_INFO_PAUSE |
                                   SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME |
                                   SNDRV_PCM_INFO_INTERLEAVED,
  ...

the generic one:

  ret = dma_get_slave_caps(chan, &dma_caps);
  if (ret == 0) {
          if (dma_caps.cmd_pause && dma_caps.cmd_resume)
                  hw.info |= SNDRV_PCM_INFO_PAUSE | SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME;
          if (dma_caps.residue_granularity <= DMA_RESIDUE_GRANULARITY_SEGMENT)
                  hw.info |= SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH;
  ...

So, let's revert back to use the generic dmaengine pcm.
