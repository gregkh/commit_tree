platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Add platform support for Ideapad 5 Pro 16ACH6-82L5

Adding support specifically for Ideapad 5 Pro 16ACH6-82L5 by adding a
allow list that can validate notebooks for which dytc_version
is less than 5, and seem to work fine at dytc_version 4. This code has
been tested to work properly on the specified system.
