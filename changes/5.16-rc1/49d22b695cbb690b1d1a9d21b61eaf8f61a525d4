drivers: iio: chemical: Add support for Sensirion SCD4x CO2 sensor

This is a driver for the SCD4x CO2 sensor from Sensirion. The sensor is
able to measure CO2 concentration, temperature and relative humdity.
The sensor uses a photoacoustic principle for measuring CO2 concentration.
An I2C interface is supported by this driver in order to communicate with
the sensor.
