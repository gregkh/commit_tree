ASoC: nau8824: Add DMI quirk mechanism for active-high jack-detect

Add a quirk mechanism to allow specifying that active-high jack-detection
should be used on platforms where this info is not available in devicetree.

And add an entry for the Cyberbook T116 tablet to the DMI table, so that
jack-detection will work properly on this tablet.
