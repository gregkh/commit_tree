devlink: Remove extra device_lock assert checks

PCI core code in the pci_call_probe() has a path that doesn't hold
device_lock. It happens because the ->probe() is called through the
workqueue mechanism.

   349 static int pci_call_probe(struct pci_driver *drv, struct pci_dev *dev,
   350                           const struct pci_device_id *id)
   351 {
   352
....
   377         if (cpu < nr_cpu_ids)
   378                 error = work_on_cpu(cpu, local_pci_probe, &ddi);

Luckily enough, the core still ensures that only single flow is executed,
so it safe to remove the assert checks that anyway were added for annotations
purposes.
