tty: serial: samsung: Improve naming for common macro

Having "_USI" suffix in EXYNOS_COMMON_SERIAL_DRV_DATA_USI() macro is
confusing. Rename it to just EXYNOS_COMMON_SERIAL_DRV_DATA() and provide
USI registers availability for all Exynos variants instead. While at it,
also convert .has_usi field type to bool, so its usage is more obvious.
