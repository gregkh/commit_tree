xfs: use separate btree cursor cache for each btree type

Now that we have the infrastructure to track the max possible height of
each btree type, we can create a separate slab cache for cursors of each
type of btree.  For smaller indices like the free space btrees, this
means that we can pack more cursors into a slab page, improving slab
utilization.
