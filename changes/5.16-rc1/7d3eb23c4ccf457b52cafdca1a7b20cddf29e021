tools/testing/cxl: Introduce a mock memory device + driver

Introduce an emulated device-set plus driver to register CXL memory
devices, 'struct cxl_memdev' instances, in the mock cxl_test topology.
This enables the development of HDM Decoder (Host-managed Device Memory
Decoder) programming flow (region provisioning) in an environment that
can be updated alongside the kernel as it gains more functionality.

Whereas the cxl_pci module looks for CXL memory expanders on the 'pci'
bus, the cxl_mock_mem module attaches to CXL expanders on the platform
bus emitted by cxl_test.
