f2fs: fix wrong condition to trigger background checkpoint correctly

In f2fs_balance_fs_bg(), it needs to check both NAT_ENTRIES and INO_ENTRIES
memory usage to decide whether we should skip background checkpoint, otherwise
we may always skip checking INO_ENTRIES memory usage, so that INO_ENTRIES may
potentially cause high memory footprint.
