block: inherit request start time from bio for BLK_CGROUP

Doing high IOPS testing with blk-cgroups enabled spends ~15-20% of the
time just doing ktime_get_ns() -> readtsc. We essentially read and
set the start time twice, one for the bio and then again when that bio
is mapped to a request.

Given that the time between the two is very short, inherit the bio
start time instead of reading it again. This cuts 1/3rd of the overhead
of the time keeping.
