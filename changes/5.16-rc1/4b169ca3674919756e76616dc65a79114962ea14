drm/amd/display: Add workaround flag for EDID read on certain docks

[Why]
Certain docks appear to NAK I2C writes to the segment pointer with the
MOT (middle of transaction) bit clear. This behaviour can cause EDID
reads from higher segments to fail.

[How]
Add workaround flag for links which connect to docks exhibiting this
issue.
