mctp: Add flow extension to skb

This change adds a new skb extension for MCTP, to represent a
request/response flow.

The intention is to use this in a later change to allow i2c controllers
to correctly configure a multiplexer over a flow.

Since we have a cleanup function in the core path (if an extension is
present), we'll need to make CONFIG_MCTP a bool, rather than a tristate.

Includes a fix for a build warning with clang:
