ABI: sysfs-devices-power: document some RPM statistics

Changeset 8d4b9d1bfef1 ("PM / Runtime: Add runtime PM statistics (v3)")
added runtime_active_time and runtime_suspended_time, in order
to allow powertop to identify the amount of time a device is
active/suspended.

Add an ABI description for those.
