drm/mediatek: mtk_dsi: Reset the dsi0 hardware

Reset dsi0 HW to default when power on. This prevents to have different
settingis between the bootloader and the kernel.

As not all Mediatek boards have the reset consumer configured in their
board description, also is not needed on all of them, the reset is optional,
so the change is compatible with all boards.
