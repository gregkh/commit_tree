arm64: dts: qcom: Add sc7180-trogdor-homestar

Homestar is a trogdor variant. The DT bits are essentially the same as
in the downstream tree, except for:

- skip -rev0 and rev1 which were early builds and have their issues,
  it's not very useful to support them upstream
- don't include the .dtsi for the MIPI cameras, which doesn't exist
  upstream
