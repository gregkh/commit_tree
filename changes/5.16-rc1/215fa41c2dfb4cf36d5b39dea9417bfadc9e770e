mxser: don't read from UART_FCR

The UART_FCR register is write-only. When reading it, one gets contents
of (read-only) UART_IIR instead as they are shared. This mistake was
performed in mxser_flush_buffer() to clear FIFOs.

Actually FCR handling throughout the driver is completely broken. On
many places, it respects neither mu860 settings, nor FIFO (16450 vs
16550) setting. This patch doesn't help to fix this, it actually does
the same. We will introduce a mxser_port::FCR in the next patch to fix
this issue.
