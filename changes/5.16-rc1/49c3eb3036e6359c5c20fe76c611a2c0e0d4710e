brcmfmac: Add DMI nvram filename quirk for Cyberbook T116 tablet

The Cyberbook T116 tablet contains quite generic names in the sys_vendor
and product_name DMI strings, without this patch brcmfmac will try to load:
"brcmfmac43455-sdio.Default string-Default string.txt" as nvram file which
is way too generic.

The nvram file shipped on the factory Android image contains the exact
same settings as those used on the AcePC T8 mini PC, so point the new
DMI nvram filename quirk to the acepc-t8 nvram file.
