crypto: caam - disable pkc for non-E SoCs

On newer CAAM versions, not all accelerators are disabled if the SoC is
a non-E variant. While the driver checks most of the modules for
availability, there is one - PKHA - which sticks out. On non-E variants
it is still reported as available, that is the number of instances is
non-zero, but it has limited functionality. In particular it doesn't
support encryption and decryption, but just signing and verifying. This
is indicated by a bit in the PKHA_MISC field. Take this bit into account
if we are checking for availability.

This will the following error:
[    8.167817] caam_jr 8020000.jr: 20000b0f: CCB: desc idx 11: : Invalid CHA selected.

Tested on an NXP LS1028A (non-E) SoC.
