clk: renesas: rzg2l: Add support to handle coupled clocks

The AXI and CHI clocks use the same register bit for controlling clock
output. Add a new clock type for coupled clocks, which sets the
CPG_CLKON_ETH.CLK[01]_ON bit when at least one clock is enabled, and
clears the bit only when both clocks are disabled.
