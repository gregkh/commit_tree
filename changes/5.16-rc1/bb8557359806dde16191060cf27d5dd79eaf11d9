clk: meson: meson8b: Add the HDMI PLL M/N parameters

The 3.10 vendor kernel uses only specific HDMI PLL M/N parameter
combinations. The PLL won't lock for values smaller than 50 if the
internal doubling (which is yet unknown how to use it) is disabled.
However, when this doubling is enabled then the values smaller than 50
will lock just fine. The only restriction for values greater than 50 is
that the resulting frequency must not exceed the 3.0GHz limit.

These values are taken from the endlessm 3.10 kernel which includes
additional M/N combinations for some VESA and 75Hz display modes.
