kunit: tool: misc fixes (unused vars, imports, leaked files)

Drop some variables in unit tests that were unused and/or add assertions
based on them.

For ExitStack, it was imported, but the `es` variable wasn't used so it
didn't do anything, and we were leaking the file objects.
Refactor it to just use nested `with` statements to properly close them.

And drop the direct use of .close() on file objects in the kunit tool
unit test, as these can be leaked if test assertions fail.
