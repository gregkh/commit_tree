firmware: arm_ffa: Handle compatibility with different firmware versions

The driver currently just support v1.0 of Arm FFA specification. It also
expects the firmware implementation to match the same and bail out if it
doesn't match. This is causing issue when running with higher version of
firmware implementation(e.g. v1.1 which will released soon).

In order to support compatibility with different firmware versions, let
us add additional checks and find the compatible version the driver can
work with.
