staging: r8188eu: remove dead code from rtl8188e_rf6052.c

In this driver DynamicTxHighPowerLvl is set to TxHighPwrLevel_Normal
and never changed. In the file rtl8188e_rf6052.c there are some if
statements that check DynamicTxHighPowerLvl for other values than
TxHighPwrLevel_Normal. The code in the if blocks is never executed.
Remove the dead code.
