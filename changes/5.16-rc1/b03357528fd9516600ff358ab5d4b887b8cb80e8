misc_cgroup: remove error log to avoid log flood

In scenarios where containers are frequently created and deleted,
a large number of error logs maybe generated. The logs only show
which node is about to go over the max limit, not the node which
resource request failed. As misc.events has provided relevant
information, maybe we can remove this log.
