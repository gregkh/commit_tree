mctp: locking, lifetime and validity changes for sk_keys

We will want to invalidate sk_keys in a future change, which will
require a boolean flag to mark invalidated items in the socket & net
namespace lists. We'll also need to take a reference to keys, held over
non-atomic contexts, so we need a refcount on keys also.

This change adds a validity flag (currently always true) and refcount to
struct mctp_sk_key.  With a refcount on the keys, using RCU no longer
makes much sense; we have exact indications on the lifetime of keys. So,
we also change the RCU list traversal to a locked implementation.
