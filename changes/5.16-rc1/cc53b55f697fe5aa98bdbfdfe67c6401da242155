fsnotify: Don't insert unmergeable events in hashtable

Some events, like the overflow event, are not mergeable, so they are not
hashed.  But, when failing inside fsnotify_add_event for lack of space,
fsnotify_add_event() still calls the insert hook, which adds the
overflow event to the merge list.  Add a check to prevent any kind of
unmergeable event to be inserted in the hashtable.
