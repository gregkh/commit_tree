KVM: MMU: mark page dirty in make_spte

This simplifies set_spte, which we want to remove, and unifies code
between the shadow MMU and the TDP MMU.  The warning will be added
back later to make_spte as well.

There is a small disadvantage in the TDP MMU; it may unnecessarily mark
a page as dirty twice if two vCPUs end up mapping the same page twice.
However, this is a very small cost for a case that is already rare.
