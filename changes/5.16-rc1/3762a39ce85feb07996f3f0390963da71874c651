selftests/bpf: Split out bpf_verif_scale selftests into multiple tests

Instead of using subtests in bpf_verif_scale selftest, turn each scale
sub-test into its own test. Each subtest is compltely independent and
just reuses a bit of common test running logic, so the conversion is
trivial. For convenience, keep all of BPF verifier scale tests in one
file.

This conversion shaves off a significant amount of time when running
test_progs in parallel mode. E.g., just running scale tests (-t verif_scale):

BEFORE
======
Summary: 24/0 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

real    0m22.894s
user    0m0.012s
sys     0m22.797s

AFTER
=====
Summary: 24/0 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

real    0m12.044s
user    0m0.024s
sys     0m27.869s

Ten second saving right there. test_progs -j is not yet ready to be
turned on by default, unfortunately, and some tests fail almost every
time, but this is a good improvement nevertheless. Ignoring few
failures, here is sequential vs parallel run times when running all
tests now:

SEQUENTIAL
==========
Summary: 206/953 PASSED, 4 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

real    1m5.625s
user    0m4.211s
sys     0m31.650s

PARALLEL
========
Summary: 204/952 PASSED, 4 SKIPPED, 2 FAILED

real    0m35.550s
user    0m4.998s
sys     0m39.890s
