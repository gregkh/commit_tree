memory: mtk-smi: Use clk_bulk clock ops

Use clk_bulk interface instead of the orginal one to simplify the code.

For SMI larbs: Require apb/smi clocks while gals is optional.
For SMI common: Require apb/smi/gals0/gal1 in has_gals case. Otherwise,
                also only require apb/smi, No optional clk here.

About the "has_gals" flag, for smi larbs, the gals clock also may be
optional even this platform support it. thus it always use
*_bulk_get_optional, then the flag has_gals is unnecessary. Remove it.
The smi_common's has_gals still keep it.

Also remove clk fail logs since bulk interface already output fail log.
