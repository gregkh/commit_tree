arm64: kasan: mte: move GCR_EL1 switch to task switch when KASAN disabled

It is not necessary to write to GCR_EL1 on every kernel entry and
exit when HW tag-based KASAN is disabled because the kernel will not
execute any IRG instructions in that mode. Since accessing GCR_EL1
can be expensive on some microarchitectures, avoid doing so by moving
the access to task switch when HW tag-based KASAN is disabled.
