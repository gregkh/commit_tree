ptp: ocp: Avoid operator precedence warning in ptp_ocp_summary_show()

Clang warns twice:

drivers/ptp/ptp_ocp.c:2065:16: error: operator '?:' has lower precedence
than '&'; '&' will be evaluated first
[-Werror,-Wbitwise-conditional-parentheses]
                           on & map ? " ON" : "OFF", src);
                           ~~~~~~~~ ^
drivers/ptp/ptp_ocp.c:2065:16: note: place parentheses around the '&'
expression to silence this warning
                           on & map ? " ON" : "OFF", src);
                                    ^
                           (       )
drivers/ptp/ptp_ocp.c:2065:16: note: place parentheses around the '?:'
expression to evaluate it first
                           on & map ? " ON" : "OFF", src);
                                    ^

on and map are both booleans so this should be a logical AND, which
clears up the operator precedence issue.
