drm: Remove unused code to load the non-existing fbcon.ko

Commit 6104c37094e7 ("fbcon: Make fbcon a built-time depency for fbdev")
changed the FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE Kconfig symbol from tristate to bool.

But the drm_kms_helper_init() function still attempts to load the fbcon
module, even when this is always built-in since the mentioned change.
