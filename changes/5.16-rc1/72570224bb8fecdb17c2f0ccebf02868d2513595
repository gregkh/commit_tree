mips, bpf: Add JIT workarounds for CPU errata

This patch adds workarounds for the following CPU errata to the MIPS
eBPF JIT, if enabled in the kernel configuration.

  - R10000 ll/sc weak ordering
  - Loongson-3 ll/sc weak ordering
  - Loongson-2F jump hang

The Loongson-2F nop errata is implemented in uasm, which the JIT uses,
so no additional mitigations are needed for that.
