KVM: X86: Don't flush current tlb on shadow page modification

After any shadow page modification, flushing tlb only on current VCPU
is weird due to other VCPU's tlb might still be stale.

In other words, if there is any mandatory tlb-flushing after shadow page
modification, SET_SPTE_NEED_REMOTE_TLB_FLUSH or remote_flush should be
set and the tlbs of all VCPUs should be flushed.  There is not point to
only flush current tlb except when the request is from vCPU's or pCPU's
activities.

If there was any bug that mandatory tlb-flushing is required and
SET_SPTE_NEED_REMOTE_TLB_FLUSH/remote_flush is failed to set, this patch
would expose the bug in a more destructive way.  The related code paths
are checked and no missing SET_SPTE_NEED_REMOTE_TLB_FLUSH is found yet.

Currently, there is no optional tlb-flushing after sync page related code
is changed to flush tlb timely.  So we can just remove these local flushing
code.
