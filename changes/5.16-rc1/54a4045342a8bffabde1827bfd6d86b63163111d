scsi: ufs: core: Do not exit ufshcd_reset_and_restore() unless operational or dead

Callers of ufshcd_reset_and_restore() expect it to return in an operational
state. However, the code only checks direct errors and so the ufshcd_state
may not be UFSHCD_STATE_OPERATIONAL due to error interrupts.

Fix by also checking ufshcd_state, still allowing non-fatal errors which
are left for the error handler to deal with.
