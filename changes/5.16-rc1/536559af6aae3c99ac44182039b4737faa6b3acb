clk: imx: Remove unused helpers

Remove all the helpers that are not referenced anywhere
anymore. Most of them are not clk_hw based. The rest are
passing the device as an argument and were intented for
BLK_CTL driver usage, but that is not the case anymore since
the BLK_CTL is (or will be) implemented outside of CCF.
