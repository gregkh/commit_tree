ASoC: soc-pcm: Don't reconnect an already active BE

In some cases, multiple FE components have the same BE component in their
respective DPCM paths. One such example would be a mixer component, which
can receive two or more inputs and sends a mixed output. In such cases,
to avoid reconfiguration of already active DAI (mixer output DAI in this
case), check the BE stream state to filter out the redundancy.

In summary, allow connection of BE if the respective current stream state
is either NEW or CLOSED.
