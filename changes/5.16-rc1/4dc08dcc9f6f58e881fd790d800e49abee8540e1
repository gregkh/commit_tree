net: phy: dp83867: introduce critical chip default init for non-of platform

PHY driver dp83867 has rich supports for OF-platform to fine-tune the PHY
chip during phy configuration. However, for non-OF platform, certain PHY
tunable parameters such as IO impedance and RX & TX internal delays are
critical and should be initialized to its default during PHY driver probe.
