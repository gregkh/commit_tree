drm/i915/display: Renaming DRRS functions to intel_drrs_*()

We had a mix of intel_edp_drrs_*(), intel_dp_drrs_*() and
intel_dp_set_drrs_state(), so properly renaming all functions to
keep the same pattern.

While at it, also dropping intel_dp_set_drrs_state from the
documentation as it is a static function.

v3:
- dropping documentation style comment in static function
(intel_drrs_set_state)
