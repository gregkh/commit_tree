mm: list_lru: remove holding lru lock

Since commit e5bc3af7734f ("rcu: Consolidate PREEMPT and !PREEMPT
synchronize_rcu()"), the critical section of spin lock can serve as an
RCU read-side critical section which already allows readers that hold
nlru->lock to avoid taking rcu lock.  So just remove holding lock.
