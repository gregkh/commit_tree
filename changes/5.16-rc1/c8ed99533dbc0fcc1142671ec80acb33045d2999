PM: EM: Mark inefficient states

Some SoCs, such as the sd855 have OPPs within the same performance domain,
whose cost is higher than others with a higher frequency. Even though
those OPPs are interesting from a cooling perspective, it makes no sense
to use them when the device can run at full capacity. Those OPPs handicap
the performance domain, when choosing the most energy-efficient CPU and
are wasting energy. They are inefficient.

Hence, add support for such OPPs to the Energy Model. The table can now
be read skipping inefficient performance states (and by extension,
inefficient OPPs).
