coresight: etm-pmu: Ensure the AUX handle is valid

The ETM perf infrastructure closes out a handle during event_stop
or on an error in starting the event. In either case, it is possible
for a "sink" to update/close the handle, under certain circumstances.
(e.g no space in ring buffer.). So, ensure that we handle this
gracefully in the PMU driver by verifying the handle is still valid.
