mm: Add folio flag manipulation functions

These new functions are the folio analogues of the various PageFlags
functions.  If CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGFLAGS is enabled, we check the folio
is not a tail page at every invocation.  This will also catch the
PagePoisoned case as a poisoned page has every bit set, which would
include PageTail.

This saves 1684 bytes of text with the distro-derived config that
I'm testing due to removing a double call to compound_head() in
PageSwapCache().
