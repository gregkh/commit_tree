ABI: evm: place a second what at the next line

Originally, get_abi.pl was using spaces to separate What: parameters,
but there are several references that declare things like:

	/sys/class/powercap/.../<power zone>/enabled

So, the logic was changes in order to properly address it.
That broke the second What added by
Changeset 18e49b304633 ("ABI: security: fix location for evm and ima_policy").

As the only file that defines multiple What: at the same line is
this file, let's move the second What: to a separate line.

Fixes: 18e49b304633 ("ABI: security: fix location for evm and ima_policy")
Fixes: ab9c14805b37 ("scripts: get_abi.pl: Better handle multiple What parameters")
