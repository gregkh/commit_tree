perf metric: Don't compute unused events

For a metric like:

  EVENT1 if #smt_on else EVENT2

currently EVENT1 and EVENT2 will be measured and then when the metric is
reported EVENT1 or EVENT2 will be printed depending on the value from
smt_on() during the expr parsing. Computing both events is unnecessary and
can lead to multiplexing as discussed in this thread:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201110100346.2527031-1-irogers@google.com/

If the input is constant to certain operators like:

 IDS1 if CONST else IDS2

then the result will be either IDS1 or IDS2 depending on CONST (which
may be evaluated from an entire expression), and so IDS1 or IDS2 may
be discarded avoiding events from being programmed.
