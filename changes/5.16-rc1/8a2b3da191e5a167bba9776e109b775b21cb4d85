btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode

Move the call to btrfs_truncate_inode_items(), and the surrounding retry
loop, into a local helper function. This avoids some repetition and avoids
making the next change a bit awkward due to a bit of too much indentation.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 6/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.
