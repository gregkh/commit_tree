ASoC: cs42l42: Remove unused runtime_suspend/runtime_resume callbacks

The driver has runtime_suspend and runtime_resume callbacks, but
pm_runtime is never enabled so these functions won't be called. They
could not be used anyway because the runtime_suspend would cause jack
detect to stop working.

These functions are unused - delete them.
