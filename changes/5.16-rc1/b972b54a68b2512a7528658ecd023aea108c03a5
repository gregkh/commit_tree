net: bcmgenet: Patch PHY interface for dedicated PHY driver

When we are using a dedicated PHY driver (not the Generic PHY driver)
chances are that it is going to configure RGMII delays and do that in a
way that is incompatible with our incorrect interpretation of the
phy_interface value.

Add a quirk in order to reverse the PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to the
value of PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID such that the MAC continues to be
configured the way it used to be, but the PHY driver can account for
adding delays. Conversely when PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID is
specified, return PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_RXID to the PHY since we will
have enabled a TXC MAC delay (id_mode_dis=0, meaning there is a delay
inserted).

This is not considered a bug fix at this point since it only affects
Broadcom STB platforms shipping with a Device Tree blob that is not
updatable in the field (quite a few devices out there) and which was
generated using the scripted Device Tree environment shipped with those
platforms' SDK.
