drm/i915: Don't back up pinned LMEM context images and rings during suspend

Pinned context images are now reset during resume. Don't back them up,
and assuming that rings can be assumed empty at suspend, don't back them
up either.

Introduce a new object flag, I915_BO_ALLOC_PM_VOLATILE meaning that an
object is allowed to lose its content on suspend.

- Slight documentation clarification (Matthew Auld)
