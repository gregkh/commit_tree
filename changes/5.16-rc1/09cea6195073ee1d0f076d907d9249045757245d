arm64: support page mapping percpu first chunk allocator

Percpu embedded first chunk allocator is the firstly option, but it
could fails on ARM64, eg,

  percpu: max_distance=0x5fcfdc640000 too large for vmalloc space 0x781fefff0000
  percpu: max_distance=0x600000540000 too large for vmalloc space 0x7dffb7ff0000
  percpu: max_distance=0x5fff9adb0000 too large for vmalloc space 0x5dffb7ff0000

then we could get

  WARNING: CPU: 15 PID: 461 at vmalloc.c:3087 pcpu_get_vm_areas+0x488/0x838

and the system could not boot successfully.

Let's implement page mapping percpu first chunk allocator as a fallback
to the embedding allocator to increase the robustness of the system.
