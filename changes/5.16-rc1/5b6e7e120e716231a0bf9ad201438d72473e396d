erofs: remove the fast path of per-CPU buffer decompression

As Xiang mentioned, such path has no real impact to our current
decompression strategy, remove it directly. Also, update the return
value of z_erofs_lz4_decompress() to 0 if success to keep consistent
with LZMA which will return 0 as well for that case.
