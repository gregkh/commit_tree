crypto: qat - remove unneeded packed attribute

Remove packed attribute from structures that do not need to be packed.
These are just used internally and not shared with firmware.

This also fixes a series of warning when compiling the driver with the
flag -Waddress-of-packed-member, similar to the following:

    drivers/crypto/qat/qat_c62xvf/adf_c62xvf_hw_data.c:102:28: warning: taking address of packed member 'csr_ops' of class or structure 'adf_hw_device_data' may result in an unaligned pointer value
