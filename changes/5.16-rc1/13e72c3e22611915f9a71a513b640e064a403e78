soc: qcom: spm: Implement support for SAWv4.1, SDM630/660 L2 AVS

Implement the support for SAW v4.1, used in at least MSM8998,
SDM630, SDM660 and APQ variants and, while at it, also add the
configuration for the SDM630/660 Silver and Gold cluster L2
Adaptive Voltage Scaler: this is also one of the prerequisites
to allow the OSM controller to perform DCVS.

Please note that despite there are various "versions" of these
values downstream, these are the only ones that are perfectly
stable on the entire set of tested devices.
