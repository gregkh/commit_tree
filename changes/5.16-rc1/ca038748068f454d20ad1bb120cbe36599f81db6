gpio: tegra186: Force one interrupt per bank

Newer chips support up to 8 interrupts per bank, which can be useful to
balance the load and decrease latency. However, it also required a very
complicated interrupt routing to be set up. To keep things simple for
now, ensure that a single interrupt per bank is enforced, even if all
possible interrupts are described in device tree.
