smackfs: Fix use-after-free in netlbl_catmap_walk()

Syzkaller reported use-after-free bug as described in [1]. The bug is
triggered when smk_set_cipso() tries to free stale category bitmaps
while there are concurrent reader(s) using the same bitmaps.

Wait for RCU grace period to finish before freeing the category bitmaps
in smk_set_cipso(). This makes sure that there are no more readers using
the stale bitmaps and freeing them should be safe.
