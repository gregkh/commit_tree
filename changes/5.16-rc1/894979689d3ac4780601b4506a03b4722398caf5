s390/ftrace: provide separate ftrace_caller/ftrace_regs_caller implementations

ftrace_regs_caller is an alias to ftrace_caller - making ftrace_caller
quite heavyweight. Split the function and provide an ftrace_caller
implementation which comes with fewer instructions. Especially getting
rid of 'stosm' on each function entry should help here, e.g. to
have less performance impact on live patched functions.
