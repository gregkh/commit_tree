staging: r8188eu: remove rtw_hal_c2h_id_filter_ccx function

Remove rtw_hal_c2h_id_filter_ccx from hal/hal_intf.c and its one caller
from core/rtw_cmd.c. This function is a wrapper function which returns
the c2h_id_filter_ccx function pointer of struct hal_ops unconditionally.
As this function pointer is never set, and the function call's return
value is subsequently called inside an if condition, this could lead to
an attempt to deference a NULL pointer, which would crash the driver.
