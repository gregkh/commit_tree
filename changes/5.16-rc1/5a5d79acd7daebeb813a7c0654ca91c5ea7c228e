RISC-V: KVM: Handle WFI exits for VCPU

We get illegal instruction trap whenever Guest/VM executes WFI
instruction.

This patch handles WFI trap by blocking the trapped VCPU using
kvm_vcpu_block() API. The blocked VCPU will be automatically
resumed whenever a VCPU interrupt is injected from user-space
or from in-kernel IRQCHIP emulation.
