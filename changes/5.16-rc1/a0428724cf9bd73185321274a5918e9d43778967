auxdisplay: ht16k33: Add support for segment displays

The Holtek HT16K33 LED controller is not only used for driving
dot-matrix displays, but also for driving segment displays.

Add support for 4-digit 7-segment and quad 14-segment alphanumeric
displays, like the Adafruit 7-segment and 14-segment display backpack
and FeatherWing expansion boards.  Use the character line display core
support to display a message, which will be scrolled if it doesn't fit.
