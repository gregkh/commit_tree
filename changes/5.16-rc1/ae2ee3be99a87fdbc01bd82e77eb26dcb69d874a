net/mlx5: CT: Remove warning of ignore_flow_level support for VFs

ignore_flow_level isn't supported for VFs, and so it causes
post_act and ct to warn about it.

Instead of disabling CT for VFs, and a driver update will be need
to enable CT again once firmware support this, remove this warning
specifically for VFs. This way, it could be automatically enabled on
future firmwares where VFs support ignore_flow_level capability.
