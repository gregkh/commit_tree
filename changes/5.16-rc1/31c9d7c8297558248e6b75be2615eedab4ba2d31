Documentation/process: Add tip tree handbook

Add a document to the subsystem/maintainer handbook section, which explains
what the tip tree is, how it operates and what rules and expectations it
has.

  [ bp:

   - Add a SPDX identifier, work in most comments from the thread.
   - 9bf19b78a203 ("Documentation/submitting-patches: Document the SoB
     chain") is also in the main Documentation but I'm leaving the
     paragraph here because it has the proper structure - text talks about
     SoBs and referencing somewhere else would interrupt the flow.
   - Move backtraces in changelogs to main submitting-patches.rst.
   - "Patch version information" is explained to a great detail in
     submitting-patches.rst too.
   - Hyperlink resend reminders section.
