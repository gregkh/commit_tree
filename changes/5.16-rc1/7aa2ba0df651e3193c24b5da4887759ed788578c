counter: 104-quad-8: Add IRQ support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8

The LSI/CSI LS7266R1 chip provides programmable output via the FLG pins.
When interrupts are enabled on the ACCES 104-QUAD-8, they occur whenever
FLG1 is active. Four functions are available for the FLG1 signal: Carry,
Compare, Carry-Borrow, and Index.

	Carry:
		Interrupt generated on active low Carry signal. Carry
		signal toggles every time the respective channel's
		counter overflows.

	Compare:
		Interrupt generated on active low Compare signal.
		Compare signal toggles every time respective channel's
		preset register is equal to the respective channel's
		counter.

	Carry-Borrow:
		Interrupt generated on active low Carry signal and
		active low Borrow signal. Carry signal toggles every
		time the respective channel's counter overflows. Borrow
		signal toggles every time the respective channel's
		counter underflows.

	Index:
		Interrupt generated on active high Index signal.

These four functions correspond respectivefly to the following four
Counter event types: COUNTER_EVENT_OVERFLOW, COUNTER_EVENT_THRESHOLD,
COUNTER_EVENT_OVERFLOW_UNDERFLOW, and COUNTER_EVENT_INDEX. Interrupts
push Counter events to event channel X, where 'X' is the respective
channel whose FLG1 activated.

This patch adds IRQ support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8. The interrupt line
numbers for the devices may be configured via the irq array module
parameter.
