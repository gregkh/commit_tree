drm/amdkfd: Add an optional argument into update queue operation(v2)

Currently, queue is updated with data in queue_properties.
And all allocated resource in queue_properties will not
be freed until the queue is destroyed.

But some properties(e.g., cu mask) bring some memory
management headaches(e.g., memory leak) and make code
complex. Actually they have been copied to mqd and
don't have to persist in queue_properties.

Add an argument into update queue to pass such properties,
then we can remove them from queue_properties.

v2: Don't use void *.
