irq: nds32: avoid CONFIG_HANDLE_DOMAIN_IRQ

In preparation for removing HANDLE_DOMAIN_IRQ, have arch/nds32 perform
all the necessary IRQ entry accounting in its entry code.

Currently arch/nds32 is tightly coupled with the ativic32 irqchip, and
while the entry code should logically live under arch/nds32/, moving the
entry logic there makes things more convoluted. So for now, place the
entry logic in the ativic32 irqchip, but separated into a separate
function to make the split of responsibility clear.

In future this should probably use GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER to cleanly
decouple this.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
