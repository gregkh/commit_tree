drivers/perf: hisi: Fix PA PMU counter offset

The PA PMU counter offset was correct in [1] and the driver has
already been verified. We want to keep the register offset using
lower case character in later version that is consistent with
the existed driver. Since there was no functional change, we
didn't do more test. However there is typo when modified the PA
PMU counter offset by mistake, so fix this bad mistake.
