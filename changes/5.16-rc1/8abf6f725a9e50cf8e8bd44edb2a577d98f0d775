selftests: xsk: Allow for invalid packets

Allow for invalid packets to be sent. These are verified by the Rx
thread not to be received. Or put in another way, if they are
received, the test will fail. This feature will be used to eliminate
an if statement for a stats test and will also be used by other tests
in later patches. The previous code could only deal with valid
packets.
