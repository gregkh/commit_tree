fuse: move reverting attributes to fuse_change_attributes()

In case of writeback_cache fuse_fillattr() would revert the queried
attributes to the cached version.

Move this to fuse_change_attributes() in order to manage the writeback
logic in a central helper.  This will be necessary for patches that follow.

Only fuse_do_getattr() -> fuse_fillattr() uses the attributes after calling
fuse_change_attributes(), so this should not change behavior.
