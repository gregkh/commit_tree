thermal: int340x: fix build on 32-bit targets

Commit aeb58c860dc5 ("thermal/drivers/int340x: processor_thermal: Suppot
64 bit RFIM responses") started using 'readq()' to read 64-bit status
responses from the int340x hardware.

That's all fine and good, but on 32-bit targets a 64-bit 'readq()' is
ambiguous, since it's no longer an atomic access.  Some hardware might
require 64-bit accesses, and other hardware might want low word first or
high word first.

It's quite likely that the driver isn't relevant in a 32-bit environment
any more, and there's a patch floating around to just make it depend on
X86_64, but let's make it buildable on x86-32 anyway.

The driver previously just read the low 32 bits, so the hardware
certainly is ok with 32-bit reads, and in a little-endian environment
the low word first model is the natural one.

So just add the include for the 'io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h' version.
