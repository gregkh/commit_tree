x86/sev: Replace occurrences of sev_es_active() with cc_platform_has()

Replace uses of sev_es_active() with the more generic cc_platform_has()
using CC_ATTR_GUEST_STATE_ENCRYPT. If future support is added for other
memory encyrption techonologies, the use of CC_ATTR_GUEST_STATE_ENCRYPT
can be updated, as required.
