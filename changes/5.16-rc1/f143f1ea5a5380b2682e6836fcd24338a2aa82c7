mm/writeback: Add folio_start_writeback()

Rename set_page_writeback() to folio_start_writeback() to match
folio_end_writeback().  Do not bother with wrappers that return void;
callers are perfectly capable of ignoring return values.

Add wrappers for set_page_writeback(), set_page_writeback_keepwrite() and
test_set_page_writeback() for compatibililty with existing filesystems.
The main advantage of this patch is getting the statistics right,
although it does eliminate a couple of calls to compound_head().
