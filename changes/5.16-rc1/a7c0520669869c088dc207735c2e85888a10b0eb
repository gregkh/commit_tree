scsi: core: Remove include <scsi/scsi_host.h> from scsi_cmnd.h

There are no dependencies in <scsi/scsi_cmnd.h> on the <scsi/scsi_host.h>
header file. Hence remove the scsi_host.h include directive from
scsi_cmnd.h. This include directive was introduced in February 2021 by
commit af1830956dc3 ("scsi: core: Add mq_poll support to SCSI layer").
