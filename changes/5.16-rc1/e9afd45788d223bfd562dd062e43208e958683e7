drm/msm/dpu: Remove commit and its uses in dpu_crtc_set_crc_source()

Clang warns:

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_crtc.c:162:6: error: variable 'commit' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
        if (commit)
            ^~~~~~
drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_crtc.c:106:32: note: initialize the variable 'commit' to silence this warning
        struct drm_crtc_commit *commit;
                                      ^
                                       = NULL
1 error generated.

The assignment and use of commit in the main body of
dpu_crtc_set_crc_source() were removed from v1 to v2 but the call to
drm_crtc_commit_put() at the end was not. Do that now so there is no
more warning.
