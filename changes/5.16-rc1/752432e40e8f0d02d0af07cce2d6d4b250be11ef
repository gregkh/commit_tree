arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Use maximum drive strength values for eMMC

The current drive strength values are not sufficient on non discrete
boards and this leads to CRC errors during switching to HS400 enhanced
strobe mode.

Hardware simulation results on non discrete boards shows up that use the
maximum drive strength values for data and command lines could helps
in avoiding these CRC errors.

So, update data and command line drive strength values to maximum.
