PCI/ACPI: Check for _OSC support in acpi_pci_osc_control_set()

Get rid of acpi_pci_osc_support() and check for _OSC supported features
directly in acpi_pci_osc_control_set(). There is no point in doing an
unconditional _OSC query with control=0 even when the kernel later wants to
take control over more features.

This saves one _OSC query and simplifies the code by getting rid of the
acpi_pci_osc_support() function. As a side effect, the !control checks in
acpi_pci_query_osc() can also be removed.
