bpf: Clarify data_len param in bpf_snprintf and bpf_seq_printf comments

Since the data_len in these two functions is a byte len of the preceding
u64 *data array, it must always be a multiple of 8. If this isn't the
case both helpers error out, so let's make the requirement explicit so
users don't need to infer it.
