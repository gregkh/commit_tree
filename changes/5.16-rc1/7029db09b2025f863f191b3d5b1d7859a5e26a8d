clk: at91: clk-master: add notifier for divider

SAMA7G5 supports DVFS by changing cpuck. On SAMA7G5 mck0 shares the same
parent with cpuck as seen in the following clock tree:

                       +----------> cpuck
                       |
FRAC PLL ---> DIV PLL -+-> DIV ---> mck0

mck0 could go b/w 32KHz and 200MHz on SAMA7G5. To avoid mck0 overclocking
while changing FRAC PLL or DIV PLL the commit implements a notifier for
mck0 which applies a safe divider to register (maximum value of the divider
which is 5) on PRE_RATE_CHANGE events (such that changes on PLL to not
overclock mck0) and sets the maximum allowed rate on POST_RATE_CHANGE
events.
