staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of rtw_read32()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_readr32() and usb_read32() and embed their
code into the caller (i.e., rtw_read32()).

_rtw_read32() is a mere redefinition of rtw_read32() and it is unneeded.
usb_read32() was the only functions assigned to the (*_usb_read32) pointer,
so we can simply remove it and make a direct call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
