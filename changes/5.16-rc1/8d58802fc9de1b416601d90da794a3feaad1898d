mm/writeback: throttle based on page writeback instead of congestion

do_writepages throttles on congestion if the writepages() fails due to a
lack of memory but congestion_wait() is partially broken as the
congestion state is not updated for all BDIs.

This patch stalls waiting for a number of pages to complete writeback
that located on the local node.  The main weakness is that there is no
correlation between the location of the inode's pages and locality but
that is still better than congestion_wait.
