mm: don't read i_size of inode unless we need it

We always go through i_size_read(), and we rarely end up needing it.
Push the read to down where we need to check it, which avoids it for
most cases.

It looks like we can even remove this check entirely, which might be
worth pursuing.  But at least this takes it out of the hot path.
