clk: versatile: hide clock drivers from non-ARM users

Commit 419b3ab6987f ("clk: versatile: remove dependency on ARCH_*")
made the whole menu of ARM reference clock drivers visible on all
architectures. I can't see how this is an improvement for non-ARM
users. Unless build-testing, there is no point on presenting
ARM-only clock drivers on other architectures.
