mm/writeback: Add folio_wait_writeback()

wait_on_page_writeback_killable() only has one caller, so convert it to
call folio_wait_writeback_killable().  For the wait_on_page_writeback()
callers, add a compatibility wrapper around folio_wait_writeback().

Turning PageWriteback() into folio_test_writeback() eliminates a call
to compound_head() which saves 8 bytes and 15 bytes in the two
functions.  Unfortunately, that is more than offset by adding the
wait_on_page_writeback compatibility wrapper for a net increase in text
of 7 bytes.
