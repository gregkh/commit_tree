mm: disable NUMA_BALANCING_DEFAULT_ENABLED and TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE on PREEMPT_RT

TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE:
  There are potential non-deterministic delays to an RT thread if a
  critical memory region is not THP-aligned and a non-RT buffer is
  located in the same hugepage-aligned region. It's also possible for an
  unrelated thread to migrate pages belonging to an RT task incurring
  unexpected page faults due to memory defragmentation even if
  khugepaged is disabled.

Regular HUGEPAGEs are not affected by this can be used.

NUMA_BALANCING:
  There is a non-deterministic delay to mark PTEs PROT_NONE to gather
  NUMA fault samples, increased page faults of regions even if mlocked
  and non-deterministic delays when migrating pages.
