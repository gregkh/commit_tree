net/mlx5: Publish and unpublish all devlink parameters at once

The devlink parameters were published in two steps despite being static
and known in advance.

First step was to use devlink_params_publish() which iterated over all
known up to that point parameters and sent notification messages.
In second step, the call was devlink_param_publish() that looped over
same parameters list and sent notification for new parameters.

In order to simplify the API, move devlink_params_publish() to be called
when all parameters were already added and save the need to iterate over
parameters list again.

As a side effect, this change fixes the error unwind flow in which
parameters were not marked as unpublished.
