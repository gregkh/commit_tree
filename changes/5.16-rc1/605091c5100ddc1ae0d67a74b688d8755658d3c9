selftests: xsk: Introduce replacing the default packet stream

Introduce the concept of a default packet stream that is the set of
packets sent by most tests. Then add the ability to replace it for a
test that would like to send or receive something else through the use
of the function pkt_stream_replace() and then restored with
pkt_stream_restore_default(). These are then used to convert the
STAT_TEST_TX_INVALID to use these new APIs.
