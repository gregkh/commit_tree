net: hns3: device specifications add number of mac statistics

Currently, driver queries number of mac statistics before querying mac
statistics. As the number of mac statistics is a fixed value in firmware,
it is redundant to query this number everytime before querying mac
statistics, it can just be queried once in initialization process and
saved in device specifications.
