mwifiex: Properly initialize private structure on interface type changes

When creating a new virtual interface in mwifiex_add_virtual_intf(), we
update our internal driver states like bss_type, bss_priority, bss_role
and bss_mode to reflect the mode the firmware will be set to.

When switching virtual interface mode using
mwifiex_init_new_priv_params() though, we currently only update bss_mode
and bss_role. In order for the interface mode switch to actually work,
we also need to update bss_type to its proper value, so do that.

This fixes a crash of the firmware (because the driver tries to execute
commands that are invalid in AP mode) when switching from station mode
to AP mode.
