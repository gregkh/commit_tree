bpf/tests: Add more tests for ALU and ATOMIC register clobbering

This patch expands the register-clobbering-during-function-call tests
to cover more all ALU32/64 MUL, DIV and MOD operations and all ATOMIC
operations. In short, if a JIT implements a complex operation with
a call to an external function, it must make sure to save and restore
all its caller-saved registers that may be clobbered by the call.
