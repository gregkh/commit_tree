ABI: sysfs-bus-pci: add a alternative What fields

There are some PCI ABI that aren't shown under:

	/sys/bus/pci/drivers/.../

Because they're registered with a different class. That's
the case of, for instance:

	/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC/unbind

This one is not present under /sys/bus/pci:

	$ find /sys/bus/pci -name 'CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC'

Although clearly this is provided by a PCI driver:

	/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/i2c-4/subsystem/drivers/CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC/unbind

So, add an altertate What location in order to match bind/unbind
to such devices.
