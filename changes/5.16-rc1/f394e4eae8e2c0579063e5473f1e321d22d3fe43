ath11k: Update pdev tx and rx firmware stats

Update the fields of pdev tx and tx firmware stats structure.
Missing fields resulted in wrong fw stats to be displayed as below.

root@OpenWrt:/# cat /sys/kernel/debug/ath11k/
		ipq8074\ hw2.0/mac0/fw_stats/pdev_stats | grep Illegal
Illegal rate phy errors   36839112

Note that this struct was missing its members from initial driver
support and this change doesn't introduce/modify the structure for
firmware changes.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.4.0.1-01734-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1 v2
