cgroup: bpf: Move wrapper for __cgroup_bpf_*() to kernel/bpf/cgroup.c

In commit 324bda9e6c5a("bpf: multi program support for cgroup+bpf")
cgroup_bpf_*() called from kernel/bpf/syscall.c, but now they are only
used in kernel/bpf/cgroup.c, so move these function to
kernel/bpf/cgroup.c, like cgroup_bpf_replace().
