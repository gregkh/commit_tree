ARM: 9145/1: patch: fix BE32 compilation

On BE32 kernels, the __opcode_to_mem_thumb32() interface is intentionally
not defined, but it is referenced whenever runtime patching is enabled
for the kernel, which may be for ftrace, jump label, kprobes or kgdb:

arch/arm/kernel/patch.c: In function '__patch_text_real':
arch/arm/kernel/patch.c:94:32: error: implicit declaration of function '__opcode_to_mem_thumb32' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
   94 |                         insn = __opcode_to_mem_thumb32(insn);
      |                                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since BE32 kernels never run Thumb2 code, we never end up using the
result of this call, so providing an extern declaration without
a definition makes it build correctly.
