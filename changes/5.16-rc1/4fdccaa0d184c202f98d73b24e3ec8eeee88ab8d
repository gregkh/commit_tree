iomap: Add done_before argument to iomap_dio_rw

Add a done_before argument to iomap_dio_rw that indicates how much of
the request has already been transferred.  When the request succeeds, we
report that done_before additional bytes were tranferred.  This is
useful for finishing a request asynchronously when part of the request
has already been completed synchronously.

We'll use that to allow iomap_dio_rw to be used with page faults
disabled: when a page fault occurs while submitting a request, we
synchronously complete the part of the request that has already been
submitted.  The caller can then take care of the page fault and call
iomap_dio_rw again for the rest of the request, passing in the number of
bytes already tranferred.
