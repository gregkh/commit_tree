libbpf: Ignore STT_SECTION symbols in 'maps' section

When parsing legacy map definitions, libbpf would error out when
encountering an STT_SECTION symbol. This becomes a problem because some
versions of binutils will produce SECTION symbols for every section when
processing an ELF file, so BPF files run through 'strip' will end up with
such symbols, making libbpf refuse to load them.

There's not really any reason why erroring out is strictly necessary, so
change libbpf to just ignore SECTION symbols when parsing the ELF.
