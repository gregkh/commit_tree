libbpf: Fix the use of aligned attribute

Building libbpf sources out of kernel tree (in Github repo) we run into
compilation error due to unknown __aligned attribute. It must be coming
from some kernel header, which is not available to Github sources. Use
explicit __attribute__((aligned(16))) instead.
