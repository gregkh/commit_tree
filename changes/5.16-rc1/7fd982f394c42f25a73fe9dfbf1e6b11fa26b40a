module: change to print useful messages from elf_validity_check()

elf_validity_check() checks ELF headers for errors and ELF Spec.
compliance and if any of them fail it returns -ENOEXEC from all of
these error paths. Almost all of them don't print any messages.

When elf_validity_check() returns an error, load_module() prints an
error message without error code. It is hard to determine why the
module ELF structure is invalid, even if load_module() prints the
error code which is -ENOEXEC in all of these cases.

Change to print useful error messages from elf_validity_check() to
clearly say what went wrong and why the ELF validity checks failed.

Remove the load_module() error message which is no longer needed.
This patch includes changes to fix build warns on 32-bit platforms:

warning: format '%llu' expects argument of type 'long long unsigned int',
but argument 3 has type 'Elf32_Off' {aka 'unsigned int'}
