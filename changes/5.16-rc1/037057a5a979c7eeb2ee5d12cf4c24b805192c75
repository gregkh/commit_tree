block: remove inaccurate requeue check

This check is meant to catch cases where a requeue is attempted on a
request that is still inserted. It's never really been useful to catch any
misuse, and now it's actively wrong. Outside of that, this should not be a
BUG_ON() to begin with.

Remove the check as it's now causing active harm, as requeue off the plug
path will trigger it even though the request state is just fine.
