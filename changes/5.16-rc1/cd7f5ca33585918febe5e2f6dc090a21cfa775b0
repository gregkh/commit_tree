drm/virtio: implement context init: add virtio_gpu_fence_event

Similar to DRM_VMW_EVENT_FENCE_SIGNALED.  Sends a pollable event
to the DRM file descriptor when a fence on a specific ring is
signaled.

One difference is the event is not exposed via the UAPI -- this is
because host responses are on a shared memory buffer of type
BLOB_MEM_GUEST [this is the common way to receive responses with
virtgpu].  As such, there is no context specific read(..)
implementation either -- just a poll(..) implementation.
