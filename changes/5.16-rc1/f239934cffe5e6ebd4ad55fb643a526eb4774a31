net: dsa: b53: serialize access to the ARL table

The b53 driver performs non-atomic transactions to the ARL table when
adding, deleting and reading FDB and MDB entries.

Traditionally these were all serialized by the rtnl_lock(), but now it
is possible that DSA calls ->port_fdb_add and ->port_fdb_del without
holding that lock.

So the driver must have its own serialization logic. Add a mutex and
hold it from all entry points (->port_fdb_{add,del,dump},
->port_mdb_{add,del}).
