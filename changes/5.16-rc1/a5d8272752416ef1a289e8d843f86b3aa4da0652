bpf: Be conservative while processing invalid kfunc calls

This patch also modifies the BPF verifier to only return error for
invalid kfunc calls specially marked by userspace (with insn->imm == 0,
insn->off == 0) after the verifier has eliminated dead instructions.
This can be handled in the fixup stage, and skip processing during add
and check stages.

If such an invalid call is dropped, the fixup stage will not encounter
insn->imm as 0, otherwise it bails out and returns an error.

This will be exposed as weak ksym support in libbpf in later patches.
