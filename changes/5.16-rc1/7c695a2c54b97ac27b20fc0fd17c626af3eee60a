drm/amdkfd: Remove cu mask from struct queue_properties(v2)

Actually, cu_mask has been copied to mqd memory and
does't have to persist in queue_properties. Remove it
from queue_properties.

And use struct mqd_update_info to store such properties,
then pass it to update queue operation.

v2:
* Rename pqm_update_queue to pqm_update_queue_properties.
* Rename struct queue_update_info to struct mqd_update_info.
* Rename pqm_set_cu_mask to pqm_update_mqd.
