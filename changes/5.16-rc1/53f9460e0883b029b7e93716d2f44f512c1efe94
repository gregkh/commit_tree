mmc: sdhci-omap: Restore sysconfig after reset

The sysconfig register is managed in a generic way by PM runtime for us by
the interconnect target module layer code. SDHCI_RESET_ALL also resets the
target module configuration, so we need to restore sysconfig after reset.

Note that there is no need to save and restore sysconfig during PM runtime,
the PM runtime layer will do that for us.

Not sure if this issue is a problem with the current configurations, I
noticed the issue while adding support for older TI SoCs and testing with
wlcore SDIO wlan device.
