staging: r8188eu: change the type of a variable in rtw_read16()

Change the type of "data" from __le32 to __le16. The size of the data
that usbctrl_vendorreq() will read is two bytes in little endian order,
so the most suitable type is __le16.

With the old code, since the two most significant bytes of data are not
initialized, KMSan can likely detect the reading of uninitialized data,
so this change can prevent the checker from complaining.
