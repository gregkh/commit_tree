block/ataflop: provide a helper for cleanup up an atari disk

Instead of using two separate code paths for cleaning up an atari disk,
use one. We take the more careful approach to check for *all* disk
types, as is done on exit. The init path didn't have that check as
the alternative disk types are only probed for later, they are not
initialized by default.

Yes, there is a shared tag for all disks.
