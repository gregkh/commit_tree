ASoC: dt-bindings: move LPASS clocks related bindings out of q6afe

q6afe (Audio Front End) is one of the DSP service that handles both
LPASS (Low Power Audio SubSystem) Audio ports and LPASS clocks.
As LPASS is a hardwware IP and commonly used by Qualcomm Audio DSP.
In order to allow  multiple DSP frameworks to use these bindings
its best to move it out from the dsp specific bindings.

For compatibility reasons and not breaking which is already working
we still maintain same compatible string "qcom,q6afe-clocks"

Also as part of this change convert these LPASS clocks related bindings
into yaml format.
