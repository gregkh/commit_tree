arm64: Add CNT{P,V}CTSS_EL0 alternatives to cnt{p,v}ct_el0

CNTPCTSS_EL0 and CNTVCTSS_EL0 are alternatives to the usual
CNTPCT_EL0 and CNTVCT_EL0 that do not require a previous ISB
to be synchronised (SS stands for Self-Synchronising).

Use the ARM64_HAS_ECV capability to control alternative sequences
that switch to these low(er)-cost primitives. Note that the
counter access in the VDSO is for now left alone until we decide
whether we want to allow this.
