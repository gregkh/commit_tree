ASoC: SOF: Don't set up widgets during topology parsing

In preparation for supporting dynamic pipelines, move the
widget setup, DAI config IPCs to the complete callback
during topology loading. For current topology where all
the pipelines are static, all the pipelines will be set up
during complete. For topologies with dynamic and static pipelines,
this will enable setting up only the static ones  during
topology loading. Reuse the sof_restore_pipelines() function for
this purpose and rename it to sof_set_up_pipelines().
