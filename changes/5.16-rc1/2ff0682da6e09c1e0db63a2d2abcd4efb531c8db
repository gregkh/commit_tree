block: store elevator state in request

Add an rq private RQF_ELV flag, which tells the block layer that this
request was initialized on a queue that has an IO scheduler attached.
This allows for faster checking in the fast path, rather than having to
deference rq->q later on.

Elevator switching does full quiesce of the queue before detaching an
IO scheduler, so it's safe to cache this in the request itself.
