cgroup: reduce dependency on cgroup_mutex

Currently cgroup_get_from_path() and cgroup_get_from_id() grab
cgroup_mutex before traversing the default hierarchy to find the
kernfs_node corresponding to the path/id and then extract the linked
cgroup. Since cgroup_mutex is still held, it is guaranteed that the
cgroup will be alive and the reference can be taken on it.

However similar guarantee can be provided without depending on the
cgroup_mutex and potentially reducing avenues of cgroup_mutex contentions.
The kernfs_node's priv pointer is RCU protected pointer and with just
rcu read lock we can grab the reference on the cgroup without
cgroup_mutex. So, remove cgroup_mutex from them.
