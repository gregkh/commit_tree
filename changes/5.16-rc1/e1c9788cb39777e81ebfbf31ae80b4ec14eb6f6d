ceph: don't rely on error_string to validate blocklisted session.

The "error_string" in the metadata of MClientSession is being
parsed by kclient to validate whether the session is blocklisted.
The "error_string" is for humans and shouldn't be relied on it.
Hence added the flag to MClientsession to indicate the session
is blocklisted.
