media: mt9p031: Fix corrupted frame after restarting stream

To prevent corrupted frames after starting and stopping the sensor its
datasheet specifies a specific pause sequence to follow:

Stopping:
	Set Pause_Restart Bit -> Set Restart Bit -> Set Chip_Enable Off

Restarting:
	Set Chip_Enable On -> Clear Pause_Restart Bit

The Restart Bit is cleared automatically and must not be cleared
manually as this would cause undefined behavior.
