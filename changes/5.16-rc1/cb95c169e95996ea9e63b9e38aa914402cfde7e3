clk: mediatek: Fix corner case of tuner_en_reg

On MT8195, tuner_en_reg is moved to register offest 0x0.
If we only judge by tuner_en_reg, it may lead to wrong address.
Add tuner_en_bit to the check condition. And it has been confirmed,
on all the MediaTek SoCs, bit0 of offset 0x0 is always occupied by
clock square control.
