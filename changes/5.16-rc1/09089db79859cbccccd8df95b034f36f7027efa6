irq_work: Also rcuwait for !IRQ_WORK_HARD_IRQ on PREEMPT_RT

On PREEMPT_RT most items are processed as LAZY via softirq context.
Avoid to spin-wait for them because irq_work_sync() could have higher
priority and not allow the irq-work to be completed.

Wait additionally for !IRQ_WORK_HARD_IRQ irq_work items on PREEMPT_RT.
