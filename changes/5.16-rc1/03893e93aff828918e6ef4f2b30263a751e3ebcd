mwifiex: Don't log error on suspend if wake-on-wlan is disabled

It's not an error if someone chooses to put their computer to sleep, not
wanting it to wake up because the person next door has just discovered
what a magic packet is. So change the loglevel of this annoying message
from ERROR to INFO.
