selinux: fix all of the W=1 build warnings

There were a number of places in the code where the function
definition did not match the associated comment block as well
at least one file where the appropriate header files were not
included (missing function declaration/prototype); this patch
fixes all of these issue such that building the SELinux code
with "W=1" is now warning free.
