staging: r8188eu: hal: remove goto statement and local variable

Remove the goto statement from FillH2CCmd_88E(). In this function goto
can be replace by return statement. As on goto label exit, function
only return it is not performing any cleanup. Avoiding goto will
improve the function readability. After replacing the goto statement
local variable ret is also not needed. So remove the ret local variable.
