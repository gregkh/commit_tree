clk: samsung: clk-pll: Implement pll0831x PLL type

pll0831x PLL is used in Exynos850 SoC for top-level fractional PLLs. The
code was derived from very similar pll36xx type, with next differences:

1. Lock time for pll0831x is 500*P_DIV, when for pll36xx it's 3000*P_DIV
2. It's not suggested in Exynos850 TRM that S_DIV change doesn't require
   performing PLL lock procedure (which is done in pll36xx
   implementation)
3. The offset from PMS-values register to K-value register is 0x8 for
   pll0831x, when for pll36xx it's 0x4

When defining pll0831x type, CON3 register offset should be provided as
a "con" parameter of PLL() macro, like this:

    PLL(pll_0831x, 0, "fout_mmc_pll", "oscclk",
        PLL_LOCKTIME_PLL_MMC, PLL_CON3_PLL_MMC, pll0831x_26mhz_tbl),

To define PLL rates table, one can use PLL_36XX_RATE() macro, e.g.:

    PLL_36XX_RATE(26 * MHZ, 799999877, 31, 1, 0, -15124)

as it's completely appropriate for pl0831x type and there is no sense in
duplicating that.

If bit #1 (MANUAL_PLL_CTRL) is not set in CON1 register, it won't be
possible to set new rate, with next error showing in kernel log:

    Could not lock PLL fout_mmc_pll

That can happen for example if bootloader clears that bit beforehand.
PLL driver doesn't account for that, so if MANUAL_PLL_CTRL bit was
cleared, it's assumed it was done for a reason and it shouldn't be
possible to change that PLL's rate at all.
