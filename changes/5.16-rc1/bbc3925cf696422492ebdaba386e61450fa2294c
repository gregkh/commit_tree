cdrom: Remove redundant variable and its assignment

Variable is not used in functions, and its assignment is redundant too.
So it should be deleted. Also the inner-most set of parentheses is no
longer needed.

The clang_analyzer complains as follows:

drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:877: warning:

Although the value stored to 'ret' is used in the enclosing expression,
the value is never actually read from 'ret'.
