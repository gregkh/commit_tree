scsi: core: Remove the 'done' argument from SCSI queuecommand_lck functions

The DEF_SCSI_QCMD() macro passes the addresses of the SCSI host lock and
also that of the scsi_done function to the queuecommand_lck() function
implementations. Remove the 'scsi_done' argument since its address is
now a constant and instead call 'scsi_done' directly from inside the
queuecommand_lck() functions.
