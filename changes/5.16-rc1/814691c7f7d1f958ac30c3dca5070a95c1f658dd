rtc: sun6i: Allow probing without an early clock provider

Some SoCs have an RTC supported by this RTC driver, but do not have an
early clock provider declared here. Currently, this prevents the RTC
driver from probing, because it expects a global struct to already be
allocated. Fix probing the driver by copying the missing pieces from the
clock provider setup function, replacing them with the devm variants.
