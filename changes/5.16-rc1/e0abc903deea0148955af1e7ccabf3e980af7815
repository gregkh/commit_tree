serial: stm32: rework RX dma initialization and release

The RX DMA channel is kept active forever (from the probe). That prevents
going to low power mode when it is used. This change moves the
DMA configuration and enabling procedures to startup routine to allow
transition to low power mode.
The DMA disabling procedure is implemented in stop_rx routine as this
ops has to stop characters reception, and DMA transation in shutdown.
Clean useless dma_async_tx_descriptor initialization to NULL value.
