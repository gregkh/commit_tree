io_uring: remove ctx referencing from complete_post

Now completions are done from task context, that means that it's either
the task itself, task_work or io-wq worker. In all those cases the ctx
will be staying alive by mutexing, explicit referencing or req references
by iowq. Remove extra ctx pinning from io_req_complete_post().
