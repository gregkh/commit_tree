PCI: Use unsigned to match sscanf("%x") in pci_dev_str_match_path()

Cppcheck warns that pci_dev_str_match_path() passes pointers to signed ints
to sscanf("%x"), which expects pointers to *unsigned* ints:

  invalidScanfArgType_int drivers/pci/pci.c:312 %x in format string (no. 2) requires 'unsigned int *' but the argument type is 'signed int *'.

Declare the variables as unsigned to avoid this issue.
