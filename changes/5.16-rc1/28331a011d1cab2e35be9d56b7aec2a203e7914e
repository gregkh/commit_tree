scripts: get_abi.pl: show progress

As parsing the sysfs entries can take a long time, add
progress information.

The progress logic will update the stats on every second,
or on 1% steps of the progress.

When STDERR is a console, it will use a single line, using
a VT-100 command to erase the line before rewriting it.
Otherwise, it will put one message on a separate line.
That would help to identify what parts of sysfs checking
that it is taking more time to process.
