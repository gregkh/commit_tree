dt-bindings: phy: qcom,qmp: IPQ6018 and IPQ8074 PCIe PHY require no supply

The qmp-phy driver suggests that 'vdda-phy-supply' and 'vdda-pll-supply'
are not required for IPQ6018 and IPQ8074 QMP PCIe PHY.  Update the
bindings to reflect it.

While at it, also correct the clock properties for IPQ8074 QMP PCIe PHY.
And as the result, 'qcom,ipq8074-qmp-pcie-phy' and
'qcom,ipq6018-qmp-pcie-phy' share the same clock, reset and supply
bindings.
