ice: rebuild switchdev when resetting all VFs

As resetting all VFs behaves mostly like creating new VFs also
eswitch infrastructure has to be recreated. The easiest way to
do that is to rebuild eswitch after resetting VFs.

Implement helper functions to start and stop all representors
queues. This is used to disable traffic on port representors.

In rebuild path:
- NAPI has to be disabled
- eswitch environment has to be set up
- new port representors have to be created, because the old
one had pointer to not existing VFs
- new control plane VSI ring should be remapped
- NAPI hast to be enabled
- rxdid has to be set to FLEX_NIC_2, because this descriptor id
support source_vsi, which is needed on control plane VSI queues
- port representors queues have to be started
