dt-bindings: leds: register-bit-led: Use 'reg' instead of 'offset'

'reg' is the standard property for defining register banks/addresses. Add
it to use for the register address and deprecate 'offset'. This also
allows for using standard node names with unit-addresses. However, since
it is quite possible to have multiple nodes at the same register
address, allow for the unit-address to optionally have the bit
offset. The unit-address format is '@<reg address>[,<bit offset>]'. This
matches the format recently added for nvmem binding which has the same
issue.
