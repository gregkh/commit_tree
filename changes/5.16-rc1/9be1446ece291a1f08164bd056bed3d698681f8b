mtd: rawnand: fsmc: Fix use of SM ORDER

The introduction of the generic ECC engine API lead to a number of
changes in various drivers which broke some of them. Here is a typical
example: I expected the SM_ORDER option to be handled by the Hamming ECC
engine internals. Problem: the fsmc driver does not instantiate (yet) a
real ECC engine object so we had to use a 'bare' ECC helper instead of
the shiny rawnand functions. However, when not intializing this engine
properly and using the bare helpers, we do not get the SM ORDER feature
handled automatically. It looks like this was lost in the process so
let's ensure we use the right SM ORDER now.
