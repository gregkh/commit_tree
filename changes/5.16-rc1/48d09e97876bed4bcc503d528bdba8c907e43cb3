firmware_loader: formalize built-in firmware API

Formalize the built-in firmware with a proper API. This can later
be used by other callers where all they need is built-in firmware.

We export the firmware_request_builtin() call for now only
under the TEST_FIRMWARE symbol namespace as there are no
direct modular users for it. If they pop up they are free
to export it generally. Built-in code always gets access to
the callers and we'll demonstrate a hidden user which has been
lurking in the kernel for a while and the reason why using a
proper API was better long term.
