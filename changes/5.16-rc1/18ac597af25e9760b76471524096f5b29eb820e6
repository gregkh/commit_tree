net: ndisc: introduce ndisc_evict_nocarrier sysctl parameter

In most situations the neighbor discovery cache should be cleared on a
NOCARRIER event which is currently done unconditionally. But for wireless
roams the neighbor discovery cache can and should remain intact since
the underlying network has not changed.

This patch introduces a sysctl option ndisc_evict_nocarrier which can
be disabled by a wireless supplicant during a roam. This allows packets
to be sent after a roam immediately without having to wait for
neighbor discovery.

A user reported roughly a 1 second delay after a roam before packets
could be sent out (note, on IPv4). This delay was due to the ARP
cache being cleared. During testing of this same scenario using IPv6
no delay was noticed, but regardless there is no reason to clear
the ndisc cache for wireless roams.
