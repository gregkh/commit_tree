drm/msm/dp: Allow sub-regions to be specified in DT

Not all platforms has P0 at an offset of 0x1000 from the base address,
so add support for specifying each sub-region in DT. The code falls back
to the predefined offsets in the case that only a single reg is
specified, in order to support existing DT.
