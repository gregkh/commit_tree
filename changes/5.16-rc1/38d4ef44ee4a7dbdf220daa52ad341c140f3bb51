mm/memcg: remove obsolete memcg_free_kmem()

Since commit d648bcc7fe65 ("mm: kmem: make memcg_kmem_enabled()
irreversible"), the only thing memcg_free_kmem() does is to call
memcg_offline_kmem() when the memcg is still online which can happen
when online_css() fails due to -ENOMEM.

However, the name memcg_free_kmem() is confusing and it is more clear
and straight forward to call memcg_offline_kmem() directly from
mem_cgroup_css_free().
