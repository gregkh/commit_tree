ethernet: remove random_ether_addr()

random_ether_addr() was the original name of the helper which
was kept for backward compatibility (?) after the rename in
commit 0a4dd594982a ("etherdevice: Rename random_ether_addr
to eth_random_addr").

We have a single random_ether_addr() caller left in tree
while there are 70 callers of eth_random_addr().
Time to drop this define.
