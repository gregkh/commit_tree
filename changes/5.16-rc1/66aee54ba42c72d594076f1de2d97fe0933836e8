perf beauty: Add socket level scnprintf that handles ARCH specific SOL_SOCKET

SOL_SOCKET has a different value according to the architecture, some
have it as 0xffff while all the others have it as 1, so a simple string
array isn't usable, add a scnprintf routine that treats it as a special
case, using the array for other values.
