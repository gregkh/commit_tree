libbpf: Support uniform BTF-defined key/value specification across all BPF maps

A bunch of BPF maps do not support specifying BTF types for key and value.
This is non-uniform and inconvenient[0]. Currently, libbpf uses a retry
logic which removes BTF type IDs when BPF map creation failed. Instead
of retrying, this commit recognizes those specialized maps and removes
BTF type IDs when creating BPF map.
