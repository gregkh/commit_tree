drm/i915/guc: put all guc objects in lmem when available

The firmware binary has to be loaded from lmem and the recommendation is
to put all other objects in there as well. Note that we don't fall back
to system memory if the allocation in lmem fails because all objects are
allocated during driver load and if we have issues with lmem at that point
something is seriously wrong with the system, so no point in trying to
handle it.
