RISC-V: KVM: Implement KVM_GET_ONE_REG/KVM_SET_ONE_REG ioctls

For KVM RISC-V, we use KVM_GET_ONE_REG/KVM_SET_ONE_REG ioctls to access
VCPU config and registers from user-space.

We have three types of VCPU registers:
1. CONFIG - these are VCPU config and capabilities
2. CORE   - these are VCPU general purpose registers
3. CSR    - these are VCPU control and status registers

The CONFIG register available to user-space is ISA. The ISA register is
a read and write register where user-space can only write the desired
VCPU ISA capabilities before running the VCPU.

The CORE registers available to user-space are PC, RA, SP, GP, TP, A0-A7,
T0-T6, S0-S11 and MODE. Most of these are RISC-V general registers except
PC and MODE. The PC register represents program counter whereas the MODE
register represent VCPU privilege mode (i.e. S/U-mode).

The CSRs available to user-space are SSTATUS, SIE, STVEC, SSCRATCH, SEPC,
SCAUSE, STVAL, SIP, and SATP. All of these are read/write registers.

In future, more VCPU register types will be added (such as FP) for the
KVM_GET_ONE_REG/KVM_SET_ONE_REG ioctls.
