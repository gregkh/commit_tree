usb: typec: ucsi: Better fix for missing unplug events issue

The commit 217504a05532 ("usb: typec: ucsi: Work around PPM
losing change information") had solved this issue
previously, but in a really complex manner. The core issue
is that on some platforms the EC firmware does not interrupt
the driver on unplug event in some cases, mainly when the
cable is unplugged immediately after the plug-in.

From now on handling that problem by simply re-checking new
connections.
