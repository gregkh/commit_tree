crypto: sm4 - Do not change section of ck and sbox

When building with clang and GNU as, there is a warning about ignored
changed section attributes:

/tmp/sm4-c916c8.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/sm4-c916c8.s:677: Warning: ignoring changed section attributes for
.data..cacheline_aligned

"static const" places the data in .rodata but __cacheline_aligned has
the section attribute to place it in .data..cacheline_aligned, in
addition to the aligned attribute.

To keep the alignment but avoid attempting to change sections, use the
____cacheline_aligned attribute, which is just the aligned attribute.
