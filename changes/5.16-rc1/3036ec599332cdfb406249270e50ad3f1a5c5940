arm64: kexec: Use dcache ops macros instead of open-coding

kexec does dcache maintenance when it re-writes all memory. Our
dcache_by_line_op macro depends on reading the sanitized DminLine
from memory. Kexec may have overwritten this, so open-codes the
sequence.

dcache_by_line_op is a whole set of macros, it uses dcache_line_size
which uses read_ctr for the sanitsed DminLine. Reading the DminLine
is the first thing the dcache_by_line_op does.

Rename dcache_by_line_op dcache_by_myline_op and take DminLine as
an argument. Kexec can now use the slightly smaller macro.

This makes up-coming changes to the dcache maintenance easier on
the eye.

Code generated by the existing callers is unchanged.
