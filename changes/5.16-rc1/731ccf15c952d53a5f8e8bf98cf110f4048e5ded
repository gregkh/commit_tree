btrfs: make sure btrfs_io_context::fs_info is always initialized

Currently btrfs_io_context::fs_info is only initialized in
btrfs_map_bio, but there are call sites like btrfs_map_sblock() which
calls __btrfs_map_block() directly, leaving bioc::fs_info uninitialized
(NULL).

Currently this is fine, but later cleanup will rely on bioc::fs_info to
grab fs_info, and this can be a hidden problem for such usage.

This patch will remove such hidden uninitialized member by always
assigning bioc::fs_info at alloc_btrfs_io_context().
