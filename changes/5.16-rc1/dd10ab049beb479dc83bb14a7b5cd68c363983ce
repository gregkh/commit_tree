mm: Add folio_mapped()

This function is the equivalent of page_mapped().  It is slightly
shorter as we do not need to handle the PageTail() case.  Reimplement
page_mapped() as a wrapper around folio_mapped().  folio_mapped()
is 13 bytes smaller than page_mapped(), but the page_mapped() wrapper
is 30 bytes, for a net increase of 17 bytes of text.
