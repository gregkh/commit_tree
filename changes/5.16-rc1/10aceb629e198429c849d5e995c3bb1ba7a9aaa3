bpf: Add bpf_trace_vprintk helper

This helper is meant to be "bpf_trace_printk, but with proper vararg
support". Follow bpf_snprintf's example and take a u64 pseudo-vararg
array. Write to /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe using the same
mechanism as bpf_trace_printk. The functionality of this helper was
requested in the libbpf issue tracker [0].
