iio: st_sensors: remove st_sensors_power_disable() function

This change converts the st_sensors_power_enable() function to use
devm_add_action_or_reset() handlers to register regulator_disable hooks for
when the drivers get unloaded.

The parent device of the IIO device object is used. This is based on the
assumption that all other devm_ calls in the ST sensors use this reference.

This makes the st_sensors_power_disable() un-needed.
Removing this also changes unload order a bit, as all ST drivers would call
st_sensors_power_disable() first and iio_device_unregister() after that.
