powerpc/eeh: Use dev_driver_string() instead of struct pci_dev->driver->name

Replace pdev->driver->name by dev_driver_string() for the corresponding
struct device.  This is a step toward removing pci_dev->driver.

Move the function nearer its only user and instead of the ?: operator use a
normal "if" which is more readable.
