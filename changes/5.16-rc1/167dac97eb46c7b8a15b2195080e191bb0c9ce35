drm/msm/dp: Modify prototype of encoder based API

Functions in the DisplayPort code that relates to individual instances
(encoders) are passed both the struct msm_dp and the struct drm_encoder.
But in a situation where multiple DP instances would exist this means
that the caller need to resolve which struct msm_dp relates to the
struct drm_encoder at hand.

Store a reference to the struct msm_dp associated with each
dpu_encoder_virt to allow the particular instance to be associate with
the encoder in the following patch.
