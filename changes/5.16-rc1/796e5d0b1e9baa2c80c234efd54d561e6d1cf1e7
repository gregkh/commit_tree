iio: adc: stm32-adc: use generic binding for sample-time

Add st,min-sample-time-nsecs to channel generic binding.
Sample time can be defined par channel node. If a channel
is configured as differential, the same sample time applies
for both inputs.
Keep support of legacy st,min-sample-time-nsecs property
for backward compatibility.
