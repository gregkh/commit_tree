block: cache bdev in struct file for raw bdev IO

bdev = &BDEV_I(file->f_mapping->host)->bdev

Getting struct block_device from a file requires 2 memory dereferences
as illustrated above, that takes a toll on performance, so cache it in
yet unused file->private_data. That gives a noticeable peak performance
improvement.
