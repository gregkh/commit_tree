nbd: don't start request if nbd_queue_rq() failed

commit 6a468d5990ec ("nbd: don't start req until after the dead
connection logic") move blk_mq_start_request() from nbd_queue_rq()
to nbd_handle_cmd() to skip starting request if the connection is
dead. However, request is still started in other error paths.

Currently, blk_mq_end_request() will be called immediately if
nbd_queue_rq() failed, thus start request in such situation is
useless. So remove blk_mq_start_request() from error paths in
nbd_handle_cmd().
