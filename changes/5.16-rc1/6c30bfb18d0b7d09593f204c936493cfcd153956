KVM: arm64: Add handlers for protected VM System Registers

Add system register handlers for protected VMs. These cover Sys64
registers (including feature id registers), and debug.

No functional change intended as these are not hooked in yet to
the guest exit handlers introduced earlier. So when trapping is
triggered, the exit handlers let the host handle it, as before.
