ASoC: intel: sof_rt5682: support jsl_rt5682s_mx98360a board

This patch adds driver data for two MAX98360A speaker amplifiers on SSP1
and one ALC5682I-VS headphone codec on SSP0 for JSL platform.

Topology is leveraged from jsl_rt5682_mx98360a since the capability of
two ALC5682 variants is the same.
