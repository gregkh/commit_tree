coresight: trbe: Drop duplicate TRUNCATE flags

We mark the buffer as TRUNCATED when there is no space left
in the buffer. But we do it at different points.
    __trbe_normal_offset()
and also, at all the callers of the above function via
compute_trbe_buffer_limit(), when the limit == base (i.e
offset = 0 as returned by the __trbe_normal_offset()).

So, given that the callers already mark the buffer as TRUNCATED
drop the caller inside the __trbe_normal_offset().

This is in preparation to moving the handling of TRUNCATED
into a central place.
