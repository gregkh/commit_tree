RDMA/mlx5: Replace struct mlx5_core_mkey by u32 key

In mlx5_core and vdpa there is no use of mlx5_core_mkey members except
for the key itself.

As preparation for moving mlx5_core_mkey to mlx5_ib, the occurrences of
struct mlx5_core_mkey in all modules except for mlx5_ib are replaced by
a u32 key.
