mfd: arizona: Split of_match table into I2C and SPI versions

The Arizona driver has both some devices which only have an I2C
interface and some which only have a SPI interface. Currently both of
these share an of_match table, but this means inapproriate compatibles
are available for each interface. Tidy this up by creating a table for
each interface listing only the appropriate compatibles.
