ASoC: SOF: probe: Merge and clean up the probe and compress files

The probe debug functionality is implemented via compress support and it
was spread across two set of files:
probe.c/h
compress.c/h

Merge the two files into sof-probes.s/h and clean them up by removing
unused struct definitions, functions. We can also move most of the
functions static as they are only used internally.
