devlink: Delete reload enable/disable interface

Commit a0c76345e3d3 ("devlink: disallow reload operation during device
cleanup") added devlink_reload_{enable,disable}() APIs to prevent reload
operation from racing with device probe/dismantle.

After recent changes to move devlink_register() to the end of device
probe and devlink_unregister() to the beginning of device dismantle,
these races can no longer happen. Reload operations will be denied if
the devlink instance is unregistered and devlink_unregister() will block
until all in-flight operations are done.

Therefore, remove these devlink_reload_{enable,disable}() APIs.
