perf evsel: Add bitfield_swap() to handle branch_stack endian issue

The branch_stack struct has bit field definition which produces
different bit ordering for big/little endian.

Because of this, when branch_stack sample is collected in a BE system
and viewed/reported in a LE system, bit fields of the branch stack are
not presented properly.

To address this issue, a evsel__bitfield_swap_branch_stack() is defined
and introduced in evsel__parse_sample.
