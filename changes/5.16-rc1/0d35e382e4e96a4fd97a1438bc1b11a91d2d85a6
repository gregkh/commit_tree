cifs: Create a new shared file holding smb2 pdu definitions

This file will contain all the definitions we need for SMB2 packets
and will follow the naming convention of MS-SMB2.PDF as closely
as possible to make it easier to cross-reference beween the definitions
and the standard.

The content of this file will mostly consist of migration of existing
definitions in the cifs/smb2.pdu.h and ksmbd/smb2pdu.h files
with some additional tweaks as the two files have diverged.

This patch introduces the new smbfs_common/smb2pdu.h file
and migrates the SMB2 header as well as TREE_CONNECT and TREE_DISCONNECT
to the shared file.
