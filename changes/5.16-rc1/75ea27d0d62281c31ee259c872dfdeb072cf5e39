net: introduce a function to check if a netdev name is in use

__dev_get_by_name is currently used to either retrieve a net device
reference using its name or to check if a name is already used by a
registered net device (per ns). In the later case there is no need to
return a reference to a net device.

Introduce a new helper, netdev_name_in_use, to check if a name is
currently used by a registered net device without leaking a reference
the corresponding net device. This helper uses netdev_name_node_lookup
instead of __dev_get_by_name as we don't need the extra logic retrieving
a reference to the corresponding net device.
