lib: zstd: Add kernel-specific API

This patch:
- Moves `include/linux/zstd.h` -> `include/linux/zstd_lib.h`
- Updates modified zstd headers to yearless copyright
- Adds a new API in `include/linux/zstd.h` that is functionally
  equivalent to the in-use subset of the current API. Functions are
  renamed to avoid symbol collisions with zstd, to make it clear it is
  not the upstream zstd API, and to follow the kernel style guide.
- Updates all callers to use the new API.

There are no functional changes in this patch. Since there are no
functional change, I felt it was okay to update all the callers in a
single patch. Once the API is approved, the callers are mechanically
changed.

This patch is preparing for the 3rd patch in this series, which updates
zstd to version 1.4.10. Since the upstream zstd API is no longer exposed
to callers, the update can happen transparently.
