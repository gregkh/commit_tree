ACPICA: Avoid evaluating methods too early during system resume

ACPICA commit 0762982923f95eb652cf7ded27356b247c9774de

During wakeup from system-wide sleep states, acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
is called and it tries to get memory from the slab allocator in order
to evaluate a control method, but if KFENCE is enabled in the kernel,
the memory allocation attempt causes an IRQ work to be queued and a
self-IPI to be sent to the CPU running the code which requires the
memory controller to be ready, so if that happens too early in the
wakeup path, it doesn't work.

Prevent that from taking place by calling acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
for S0 upfront, when preparing to enter a given sleep state, and
saving the data obtained by it for later use during system wakeup.
