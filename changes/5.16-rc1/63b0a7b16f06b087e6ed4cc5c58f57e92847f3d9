ACPI: Drop ACPI_USE_BUILTIN_STDARG ifdef from acgcc.h

The ACPI_USE_BUILTIN_STDARG symbol is never set in the kernel build,
so stop checking it in include/acpi/platform/acgcc.h and drop all of
the macros depending on it (which appear to duplicate the analogous
macros from linux/stdarg.h, but in fact are never used).
