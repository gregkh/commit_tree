crypto: hisilicon/qm - support the userspace task resetting

Allocate an extra memory page for qp in the qp memory initialization.
Set a qp error flag in the extra page addr when device resetting.
This error flag can be seen in the userspace. This flag can helps
users to stop tasks when device resetting. After resetting, this error
flag will be reset when this qp is created again. So app should release
the old qp and request a new one, and do the task on the new queue
again.
