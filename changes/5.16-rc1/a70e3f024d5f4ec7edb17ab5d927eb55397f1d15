devlink: report maximum number of snapshots with regions

Each region has an independently configurable number of maximum
snapshots. This information is not reported to userspace, making it not
very discoverable. Fix this by adding a new
DEVLINK_ATTR_REGION_MAX_SNAPSHOST attribute which is used to report this
maximum.

Ex:

  $devlink region
  pci/0000:af:00.0/nvm-flash: size 10485760 snapshot [] max 1
  pci/0000:af:00.0/device-caps: size 4096 snapshot [] max 10
  pci/0000:af:00.1/nvm-flash: size 10485760 snapshot [] max 1
  pci/0000:af:00.1/device-caps: size 4096 snapshot [] max 10

This information enables users to understand why a new region command
may fail due to having too many existing snapshots.
