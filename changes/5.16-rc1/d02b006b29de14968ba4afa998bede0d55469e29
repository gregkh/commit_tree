Revert "serial: 8250: Fix reporting real baudrate value in c_ospeed field"

This reverts commit 32262e2e429cdb31f9e957e997d53458762931b7.

The commit in question claims to determine the inverse of
serial8250_get_divisor() but failed to notice that some drivers override
the default implementation using a get_divisor() callback.

This means that the computed line-speed values can be completely wrong
and results in regular TCSETS requests failing (the incorrect values
would also be passed to any overridden set_divisor() callback).

Similarly, it also failed to honour the old (deprecated) ASYNC_SPD_FLAGS
and would break applications relying on those when re-encoding the
actual line speed.

There are also at least two quirks, UART_BUG_QUOT and an OMAP1510
workaround, which were happily ignored and that are now broken.

Finally, even if the offending commit were to be implemented correctly,
this is a new feature and not something which should be backported to
stable.
