signal/x86: In emulate_vsyscall force a signal instead of calling do_exit

Directly calling do_exit with a signal number has the problem that
all of the side effects of the signal don't happen, such as
killing all of the threads of a process instead of just the
calling thread.

So replace do_exit(SIGSYS) with force_fatal_sig(SIGSYS) which
causes the signal handling to take it's normal path and work
as expected.
