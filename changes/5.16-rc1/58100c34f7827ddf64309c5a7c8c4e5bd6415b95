clocksource/drivers/arc_timer: Eliminate redefined macro error

In drivers/clocksource/, 3 drivers use "TIMER_CTRL_IE" with 3 different
values.  Two of them (mps2-timer.c and timer-sp804.c/timer-sp.h) are
localized and left unmodifed.

One of them uses a shared header file (<soc/arc/timers.h>), which is
what is causing the "redefined" warnings, so change the macro name in
that driver only. Also change the TIMER_CTRL_NH macro name.
Both macro names are prefixed with "ARC_" to reduce the likelihood
of future name collisions.

In file included from ../drivers/clocksource/timer-sp804.c:24:
../drivers/clocksource/timer-sp.h:25: error: "TIMER_CTRL_IE" redefined [-Werror]
   25 | #define TIMER_CTRL_IE           (1 << 5)        /*   VR */
../include/soc/arc/timers.h:20: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   20 | #define TIMER_CTRL_IE           (1 << 0) /* Interrupt when Count reaches limit */
