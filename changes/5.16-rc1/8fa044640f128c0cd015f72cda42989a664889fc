blk-mq: Relocate shared sbitmap resize in blk_mq_update_nr_requests()

For shared sbitmap, if the call to blk_mq_tag_update_depth() was
successful for any hctx when hctx->sched_tags is not set, then it would be
successful for all (due to nature in which blk_mq_tag_update_depth()
fails).

As such, there is no need to call blk_mq_tag_resize_shared_sbitmap() for
each hctx. So relocate the call until after the hctx iteration under the
!q->elevator check, which is equivalent (to !hctx->sched_tags).
