virt: acrn: Introduce interfaces for MMIO device passthrough

MMIO device passthrough enables an OS in a virtual machine to directly
access a MMIO device in the host. It promises almost the native
performance, which is required in performance-critical scenarios of
ACRN.

HSM provides the following ioctls:
  - Assign - ACRN_IOCTL_ASSIGN_MMIODEV
    Pass data struct acrn_mmiodev from userspace to the hypervisor, and
    inform the hypervisor to assign a MMIO device to a User VM.

  - De-assign - ACRN_IOCTL_DEASSIGN_PCIDEV
    Pass data struct acrn_mmiodev from userspace to the hypervisor, and
    inform the hypervisor to de-assign a MMIO device from a User VM.

These new APIs will be used by user space code vm_assign_mmiodev and
vm_deassign_mmiodev in
