selftest/bpf: Switch recursion test to use htab_map_delete_elem

Currently the recursion test is hooking __htab_map_lookup_elem
function, which is invoked both from bpf_prog and bpf syscall.

But in our kernel build, the __htab_map_lookup_elem gets inlined
within the htab_map_lookup_elem, so it's not trigered and the
test fails.

Fixing this by using htab_map_delete_elem, which is not inlined
for bpf_prog calls (like htab_map_lookup_elem is) and is used
directly as pointer for map_delete_elem, so it won't disappear
by inlining.
