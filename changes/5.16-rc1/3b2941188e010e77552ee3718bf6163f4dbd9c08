scripts/gdb: handle split debug for vmlinux

This is related to two previous changes.  Commit dfe4529ee4d3
("scripts/gdb: find vmlinux where it was before") and commit da036ae14762
("scripts/gdb: handle split debug").

Although Chrome OS has been using the debug suffix for modules for a
while, it has just recently started using it for vmlinux as well.  That
means we've now got to improve the detection of "vmlinux" to also handle
that it might end with ".debug".
