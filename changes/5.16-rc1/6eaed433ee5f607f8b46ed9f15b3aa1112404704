net: hns3: add update ethtool advertised link modes for FIBRE port when autoneg off

Currently, the ethtool advertised link modes of FIBRE port is cleared to
zero when autoneg is off, so user can not get the advertised link modes
info directly from "ethtool <dev>" command.

In order to ameliorate this situation, update data of speeds, fec and pause
of advertised link modes when autoneg is off.
