ASoC: fix unmet dependency on GPIOLIB

When SND_SOC_SC7180 or SND_SOC_STORM is selected,
and GPIOLIB is not selected, Kbuild gives the following
warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_MAX98357A
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && GPIOLIB [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_STORM [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_QCOM [=y]
  - SND_SOC_SC7180 [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_QCOM [=y] && I2C [=y]

This is because SND_SOC_MAX98357A is selected
by SND_SOC_STORM and SND_SOC_SC7180, but
these config options do not select or depend on
GPIOLIB, despite SND_SOC_MAX98357A depending on
GPIOLIB.

These unmet dependency bugs were detected by Kismet,
a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise if this
is not the appropriate solution.
