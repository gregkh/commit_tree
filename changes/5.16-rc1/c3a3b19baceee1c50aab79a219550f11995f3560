btrfs: rename struct btrfs_io_bio to btrfs_bio

Previously we had "struct btrfs_bio", which records IO context for
mirrored IO and RAID56, and "strcut btrfs_io_bio", which records extra
btrfs specific info for logical bytenr bio.

With "btrfs_bio" renamed to "btrfs_io_context", we are safe to rename
"btrfs_io_bio" to "btrfs_bio" which is a more suitable name now.

The struct btrfs_bio changes meaning by this commit. There was a
suggested name like btrfs_logical_bio but it's a bit long and we'd
prefer to use a shorter name.

This could be a concern for backports to older kernels where the
different meaning could possibly cause confusion or bugs. Comparing the
new and old structures, there's no overlap among the struct members so a
build would break in case of incorrect backport.

We haven't had many backports to bio code anyway so this is more of a
theoretical cause of bugs and a matter of precaution but we'll need to
keep the semantic change in mind.
