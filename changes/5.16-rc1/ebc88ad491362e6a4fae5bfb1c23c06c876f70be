rcu: Comment rcu_gp_init() code waiting for CPU-hotplug operations

Near the beginning of rcu_gp_init() is a per-rcu_node loop that waits
for CPU-hotplug operations that might have started before the new
grace period did.  This commit adds a comment explaining that this
wait does not exclude CPU-hotplug operations.
