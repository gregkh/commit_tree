ASoC: tegra: Add Tegra210 based MVC driver

The Master Volume Control (MVC) provides gain or attenuation to a digital
signal path. It can be used in input or output signal path for per-stream
volume control or it can be used as master volume control. The MVC block
has one input and one output. The input digital stream can be mono or
multi-channel (up to 7.1 channels) stream. An independent mute control is
also included in the MVC block.

This patch registers MVC driver with ASoC framework. The component driver
exposes DAPM widgets, routes and kcontrols for the device. The DAI driver
exposes MVC interfaces, which can be used to connect different components
in the ASoC layer. Makefile and Kconfig support is added to allow build
the driver. It can be enabled in the DT via "nvidia,tegra210-mvc"
compatible binding.
