watchdog: da9062: da9063: prevent pings ahead of machine reset

Proper machine resets via da9062/da9063 PMICs are very tricky as they
require special i2c atomic transfers when interrupts are not available
anymore. This is also a reason why both PMIC's restart handlers do not
use regmap but instead opt for i2c_smbus_write_byte_data() which does
i2c transfer in atomic manner. Under the hood, this function tries to
obtain i2c bus lock with call to i2c_adapter_trylock_bus() which will
return -EAGAIN (-11) if lock is not available.

Since commit 982bb70517aef ("watchdog: reset last_hw_keepalive time at
start") occasional restart handler failures with "Failed to shutdown
(err = -11)" error messages were observed, indicating that some
process is holding the i2c bus lock. Investigation into the matter
uncovered that sometimes during reboot sequence watchdog ping is issued
late into poweroff/reboot phase which did not happen before mentioned
commit (usually the watchdog ping happened immediately as commit message
suggests). As of now, when watchdog ping usually happens late into
poweroff/reboot stage when interrupts are not available anymore, i2c bus
lock cannot be released anymore and pending restart handler in turn
fails.

Thus, to prevent such late watchdog pings from happening ahead of
pending machine restart and consequently locking up the i2c bus, check
for system_state in watchdog ping handler and consequently do not send
pings anymore in case system_state > SYSTEM_RUNNING.
