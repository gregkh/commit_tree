sched/rt: Annotate the RT balancing logic irqwork as IRQ_WORK_HARD_IRQ

The push-IPI logic for RT tasks expects to be invoked from hardirq
context. One reason is that a RT task on the remote CPU would block the
softirq processing on PREEMPT_RT and so avoid pulling / balancing the RT
tasks as intended.

Annotate root_domain::rto_push_work as IRQ_WORK_HARD_IRQ.
