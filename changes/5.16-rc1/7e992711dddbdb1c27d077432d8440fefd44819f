parisc: Don't disable interrupts in cmpxchg and futex operations

I no longer think interrupts can be disabled in the futex and cmpxchg
operations because of COW breaks.  This not ideal but I suspect it's the
best we can do.

For the cmpxchg operations in syscall.S, we rely on the code to not
schedule off the gateway page.  For the futex, I added code to disable
preemption.

So far, I haven't seen the warnings with the attached change but the
change is only lightly tested.
