ARM: dts: renesas: Fix SMSC Ethernet compatible values

According to schematics, and confirmed by ID_REV register contents, the
Ethernet controllers on various development board are not SMSC LAN9220,
but different variants:
  - KZM-A9-Dual and KZM-A9-GT: LAN9221,
  - Bock-W and Marzen: LAN89218AQ.

Update the compatible values accordingly.
