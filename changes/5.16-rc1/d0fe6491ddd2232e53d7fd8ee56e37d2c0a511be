dt-bindings: sram: Document qcom,rpm-msg-ram

The Qualcomm SMEM binding always depended on a reference to a SRAM node
of compatible "qcom,rpm-msg-ram", document this as part of the SRAM
binding.

The SRAM is consumed as a whole and not split up using subnodes, so
properties related to this are not required.
