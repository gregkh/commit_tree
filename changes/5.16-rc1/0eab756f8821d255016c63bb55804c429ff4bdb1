mmc: moxart: Fix null pointer dereference on pointer host

There are several error return paths that dereference the null pointer
host because the pointer has not yet been set to a valid value.
Fix this by adding a new out_mmc label and exiting via this label
to avoid the host clean up and hence the null pointer dereference.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Explicit null dereference")
