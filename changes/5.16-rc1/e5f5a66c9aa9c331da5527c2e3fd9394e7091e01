cpuidle: Fix kobject memory leaks in error paths

Commit c343bf1ba5ef ("cpuidle: Fix three reference count leaks")
fixes the cleanup of kobjects; however, it removes kfree() calls
altogether, leading to memory leaks.

Fix those and also defer the initialization of dev->kobj_dev until
after the error check, so that we do not end up with a dangling
pointer.
