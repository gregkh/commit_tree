staging: r8188eu: remove MSG_88E calls from hal/usb_halinit.c

Remove both MSG_88E calls from hal/usb_halinit.c, as these calls serve
no purpose other than to print the name of the function they are in
(_ReadAdapterInfo8188EU) on entry and on exit, with a timing of the
function, which is better accomplished by other means. Also remove
the jiffies assignment at the start of the function, as it is no
longer used.
