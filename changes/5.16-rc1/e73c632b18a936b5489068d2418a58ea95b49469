dt-bindings: remoteproc: qcom: pas: Add QMP property

The load state power-domain, used by the co-processors to notify the
Always on Subsystem (AOSS) that a particular co-processor is up/down,
suffers from the side-effect of changing states during suspend/resume.
However the co-processors enter low-power modes independent to that of
the application processor and their states are expected to remain
unaltered across system suspend/resume cycles. To achieve this behavior
let's drop the load state power-domain and replace them with the qmp
property for all SoCs supporting low power mode signalling.

Due to the current broken load state implementation, we can afford the
binding breakage that ensues and the remoteproc functionality will remain
the same when using newer kernels with older dtbs.
