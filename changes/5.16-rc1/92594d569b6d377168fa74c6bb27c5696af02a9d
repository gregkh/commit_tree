kbuild: store the objtool command in *.cmd files

objtool_dep includes include/config/{ORC_UNWINDER,STACK_VALIDATION}
so that all the objects are rebuilt when CONFIG_ORC_UNWINDER or
CONFIG_STACK_VALIDATION is toggled.

BTW, the correct option name is not CONFIG_ORC_UNWINDER, but
CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC. Commit 11af847446ed ("x86/unwind: Rename
unwinder config options to 'CONFIG_UNWINDER_*'") missed to
adjust this part. So, this dependency has been broken for a
long time.

As you can see in 'objtool_args', there are more CONFIG options
that affect the objtool command line.

Adding more and more include/config/* is ugly and unmaintainable.

Another issue is that non-standard objects are needlessly rebuilt.
Objects specified as OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD is not processed by
objtool, but they are rebuilt anyway when CONFIG_STACK_VALIDATION
is toggled. This is not a big deal, but better to fix.

A cleaner and more precise fix is to include the objtool command in
*.cmd files so any command change is naturally detected by if_change.
