drm/i915: Only access SFC_DONE when media domain is not fused off

The SFC_DONE register lives within the corresponding VD0/VD2/VD4/VD6
forcewake domain and is not accessible if the vdbox in that domain is
fused off and the forcewake is not initialized.

This mistake went unnoticed because until recently we were using the
wrong register offset for the SFC_DONE register; once the register
offset was corrected, we started hitting errors like

  <4> [544.989065] i915 0000:cc:00.0: Uninitialized forcewake domain(s) 0x80 accessed at 0x1ce000

on parts with fused-off vdbox engines.
