crypto: qat - remove duplicated logic across GEN2 drivers

QAT GEN2 devices share most of the behavior which means a number of
device specific functions can be shared too and some differences
abstracted away by simple parameters.

The functions adf_enable_error_correction(), get_num_accels(),
get_num_aes() and get_pf2vf_offset() for c3xxx, c62x and dh895xx have
been reworked and moved to the GEN2 file, adf_gen2_hw_data.c.
The definitions of tx_rx_gap and tx_rings_mask have been moved to
adf_gen2_hw_data.h.
