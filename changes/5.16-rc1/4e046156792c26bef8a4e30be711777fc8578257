proc: Use task_is_running() for wchan in /proc/$pid/stat

The implementations of get_wchan() can be expensive. The only information
imparted here is whether or not a process is currently blocked in the
scheduler (and even this doesn't need to be exact). Avoid doing the
heavy lifting of stack walking and just report that information by using
task_is_running().
