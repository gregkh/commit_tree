platform/x86: mlx-platform: Add BIOS attributes for CoffeeLake COMEx based systems

Extend systems of class VMOD0010 equipped with CoffeeLake COMEx module
with BIOS related attributes to represent various BIOS statuses.
These attributes "bios_active_image", "bios_auth_fail",
"bios_upgrade_fail", "bios_safe_mode" has been already added to modular
system. This all of them are already documented.
- "bios_active_image" - location of current active BIOS image (0: Top,
  1: Bottom. The reported value should correspond to value expected by
  OS in case of BIOS safe mode is 0. This bit is related to Intel
  top-swap feature of DualBios on the same flash.
- "bios_auth_fail": BIOS upgrade is failed because provided BIOS image
  is not signed correctly.
- "bios_upgrade_fail" BIOS upgrade is failed by some reason not related
  to authentication. For example, due to physical SPI flash problem.
- "bios_safe_mod": - 0 : if BIOS is booted from a supposed active image;
  1 : BIOS safe mechanism was enforced by hardware (CPLD).
