nvme: add support for batched completion of polled IO

Take advantage of struct io_comp_batch, if passed in to the nvme poll
handler. If it's set, rather than complete each request individually
inline, store them in the io_comp_batch list. We only do so for requests
that will complete successfully, anything else will be completed inline as
before.
