iwlwifi: mvm: Support new TX_RSP and COMPRESSED_BA_RES versions

As part of the new rate_n_flags, a new version of this
structures was added in the FW. Add support for this new
version and for the new rate_n_flags in this API.
Both these APIs were updated in one patch since they are
using the same functions.
