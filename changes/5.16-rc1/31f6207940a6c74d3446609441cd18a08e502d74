drm/bridge: lvds-codec: Add support for LVDS data mapping select

Decoder input LVDS format is a property of the decoder chip or even
its strapping. Handle data-mapping the same way lvds-panel does. In
case data-mapping is not present, do nothing, since there are still
legacy bindings which do not specify this property.
