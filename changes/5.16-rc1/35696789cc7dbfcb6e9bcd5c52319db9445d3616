dmaengine: tegra210-adma: Re-order 'has_outstanding_reqs' member

The 'has_outstanding_reqs' member description order in structure
'tegra_adma_chip_data' does not match with the corresponding member
declaration. The same is true for member assignment in chip data
structures declared for Tegra210 and Tegra186.

This is a trivial fix to re-order the mentioned member for a better
readability.
