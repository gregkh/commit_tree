nvme: loop: clear NVME_CTRL_ADMIN_Q_STOPPED after admin queue is reallocated

The nvme-loop's admin queue may be freed and reallocated, and we have to
reset the flag of NVME_CTRL_ADMIN_Q_STOPPED so that the flag can match
with the quiesce state of the admin queue.

nvme-loop is the only driver to reallocate request queue, and not see
such usage in other nvme drivers.
