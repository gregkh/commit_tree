staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of rtw_read16()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_read16() and usb_read16() and embed their
code into the caller (i.e., rtw_read16()).

_rtw_read16() is a mere redefinition of rtw_read16() and it is unneeded.
usb_read16() was the only functions assigned to the (*_usb_read16) pointer,
so we can simply remove it and make a direct call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
