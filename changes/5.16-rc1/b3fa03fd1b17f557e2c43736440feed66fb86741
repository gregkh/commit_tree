io_uring: convert iopoll_completed to store_release

Convert explicit barrier around iopoll_completed to smp_load_acquire()
and smp_store_release(). Similar on the callback side, but replaces a
single smp_rmb() with per-request smp_load_acquire(), neither imply any
extra CPU ordering for x86. Use READ_ONCE as usual where it doesn't
matter.

Use it to move filling CQEs by iopoll earlier, that will be necessary
to avoid traversing the list one extra time in the future.
