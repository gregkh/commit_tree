media: atomisp: Fix error handling in probe

There were several issues with handling errors in lm3554_probe():
- Probe did not set the error code when v4l2_ctrl_handler_init() failed.
- It intermixed gotos for handling errors of v4l2_ctrl_handler_init()
  and media_entity_pads_init().
- It did not set the error code for failures of v4l2_ctrl_new_custom().
- Probe did not free resources in case of failures of
  atomisp_register_i2c_module().

The patch fixes all these issues.
