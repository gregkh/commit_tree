sched: Disable TTWU_QUEUE on RT

The queued remote wakeup mechanism has turned out to be suboptimal for RT
enabled kernels. The maximum latencies go up by a factor of > 5x in certain
scenarious.

This is caused by either long wake lists or by a large number of TTWU IPIs
which are processed back to back.

Disable it for RT.
