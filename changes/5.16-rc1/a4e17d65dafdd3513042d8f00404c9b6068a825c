PCI: aardvark: Fix PCIe Max Payload Size setting

Change PCIe Max Payload Size setting in PCIe Device Control register to 512
bytes to align with PCIe Link Initialization sequence as defined in Marvell
Armada 3700 Functional Specification. According to the specification,
maximal Max Payload Size supported by this device is 512 bytes.

Without this kernel prints suspicious line:

    pci 0000:01:00.0: Upstream bridge's Max Payload Size set to 256 (was 16384, max 512)

With this change it changes to:

    pci 0000:01:00.0: Upstream bridge's Max Payload Size set to 256 (was 512, max 512)
