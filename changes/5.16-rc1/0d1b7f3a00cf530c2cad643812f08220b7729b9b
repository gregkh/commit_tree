selftests: xsk: Add tests for invalid xsk descriptors

Add tests for invalid xsk descriptors in the Tx ring. A number of
handcrafted nasty invalid descriptors are created and submitted to the
tx ring to check that they are validated correctly. Corner case valid
ones are also sent. The tests are run for both aligned and unaligned
mode.

pkt_stream_set() is introduced to be able to create a hand-crafted
packet stream where every single packet is specified in detail.
