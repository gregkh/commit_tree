usb: gadget: avoid unusual inline assembly

clang does not understand the "mrc%?" syntax:

drivers/usb/gadget/udc/pxa25x_udc.c:2330:11: error: invalid % escape in inline assembly string

I don't understand it either, but removing the %? here gets it to build.
This is probably wrong and someone else should do a proper patch.

Any suggestions?
