audit: add filtering for io_uring records

This patch adds basic audit io_uring filtering, using as much of the
existing audit filtering infrastructure as possible.  In order to do
this we reuse the audit filter rule's syscall mask for the io_uring
operation and we create a new filter for io_uring operations as
AUDIT_FILTER_URING_EXIT/audit_filter_list[7].

Thanks to Richard Guy Briggs for his review, feedback, and work on
the corresponding audit userspace changes.
