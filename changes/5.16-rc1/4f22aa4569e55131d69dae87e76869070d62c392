qcom: spm: allow compile-testing

ARM_QCOM_SPM_CPUIDLE can be selected when compile-testing on
other architectures, but this causes a Kconfig warning
for QCOM_SPM:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for QCOM_SPM
  Depends on [n]: ARCH_QCOM [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - ARM_QCOM_SPM_CPUIDLE [=y] && CPU_IDLE [=y] && (ARM [=y] || ARM64) && (ARCH_QCOM [=n] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && !ARM64 && MMU [=y]

Make it possible to also compile-test this one, which can
be done now that v5.15-rc5 lets you select QCOM_SCM everywhere.
