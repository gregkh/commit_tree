staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of usb_writeN()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_writeN() and usb_writeN() and embed their
code into the caller (i.e., rtw_writeN()).

_rtw_writeN() is a mere redefinition of rtw_writeN() and it is unneeded.
usb_writeN() was the only functions assigned to the (*_usb_writeN) pointer,
so we can simply remove it and make a direct call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
