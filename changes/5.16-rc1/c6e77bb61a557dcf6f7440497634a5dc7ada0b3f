ARM: 9143/1: add CONFIG_PHYS_OFFSET default values

For platforms that are not yet converted to ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM,
we can disable CONFIG_ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT, which in turn requires
setting a correct address here.

As we actualy know what all the values are supposed to be based
on the old mach/memory.h header file contents (from git history),
we can just add them here.

This also solves a problem in Kconfig where 'make randconfig'
fails to continue if no number is selected for a 'hex' option.
Users can still override the number at configuration time, e.g.
when the memory visible to the kernel starts at a nonstandard
address on some machine, but it should no longer be required
now.

I originally posted this back in 2016, but the problem still
persists. The patch has gotten much simpler though, as almost
all platforms rely on ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT now.
