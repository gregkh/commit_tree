KVM: x86/mmu: Extract zapping of rmaps for gfn range to separate helper

Extract the zapping of rmaps, a.k.a. legacy MMU, for a gfn range to a
separate helper to clean up the unholy mess that kvm_zap_gfn_range() has
become.  In addition to deep nesting, the rmaps zapping spreads out the
declaration of several variables and is generally a mess.  Clean up the
mess now so that future work to improve the memslots implementation
doesn't need to deal with it.
