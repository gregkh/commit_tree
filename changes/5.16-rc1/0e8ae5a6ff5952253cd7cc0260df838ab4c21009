PCI/portdrv: Do not setup up IRQs if there are no users

Avoid registering service IRQs if there is no service that offers them
or no driver to register a handler against them. This saves IRQ vectors
when they are limited (e.g. on x86) and also avoids that spurious events
could hit a missing handler. Such spurious events need to be generated
by the Jailhouse hypervisor for active MSI vectors when enabling or
disabling itself.
