mm/migrate.c: remove MIGRATE_PFN_LOCKED

MIGRATE_PFN_LOCKED is used to indicate to migrate_vma_prepare() that a
source page was already locked during migrate_vma_collect().  If it
wasn't then the a second attempt is made to lock the page.  However if
the first attempt failed it's unlikely a second attempt will succeed,
and the retry adds complexity.  So clean this up by removing the retry
and MIGRATE_PFN_LOCKED flag.

Destination pages are also meant to have the MIGRATE_PFN_LOCKED flag
set, but nothing actually checks that.
