crypto: ecc - Export additional helper functions

Export the following additional ECC helper functions:
- ecc_alloc_point()
- ecc_free_point()
- vli_num_bits()
- ecc_point_is_zero()

This is done to allow future ECC device drivers to re-use existing code,
thus simplifying their implementation.

Functions are exported using EXPORT_SYMBOL() (instead of
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()) to be consistent with the functions already
exported by crypto/ecc.c.

Exported functions are documented in include/crypto/internal/ecc.h.
