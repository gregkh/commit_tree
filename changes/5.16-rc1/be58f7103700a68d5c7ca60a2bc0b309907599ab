fortify: Add compile-time FORTIFY_SOURCE tests

While the run-time testing of FORTIFY_SOURCE is already present in
LKDTM, there is no testing of the expected compile-time detections. In
preparation for correctly supporting FORTIFY_SOURCE under Clang, adding
additional FORTIFY_SOURCE defenses, and making sure FORTIFY_SOURCE
doesn't silently regress with GCC, introduce a build-time test suite that
checks each expected compile-time failure condition.

As this is relatively backwards from standard build rules in the
sense that a successful test is actually a compile _failure_, create
a wrapper script to check for the correct errors, and wire it up as
a dummy dependency to lib/string.o, collecting the results into a log
file artifact.
