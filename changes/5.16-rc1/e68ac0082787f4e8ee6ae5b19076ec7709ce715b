libbpf: Fix skel_internal.h to set errno on loader retval < 0

When the loader indicates an internal error (result of a checked bpf
system call), it returns the result in attr.test.retval. However, tests
that rely on ASSERT_OK_PTR on NULL (returned from light skeleton) may
miss that NULL denotes an error if errno is set to 0. This would result
in skel pointer being NULL, while ASSERT_OK_PTR returning 1, leading to
a SEGV on dereference of skel, because libbpf_get_error relies on the
assumption that errno is always set in case of error for ptr == NULL.

In particular, this was observed for the ksyms_module test. When
executed using `./test_progs -t ksyms`, prior tests manipulated errno
and the test didn't crash when it failed at ksyms_module load, while
using `./test_progs -t ksyms_module` crashed due to errno being
untouched.
