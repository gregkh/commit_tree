clk: sunxi-ng: Add machine dependency to A83T CCU

The CCUs for all other 32-bit SoCs have a dependency on a specific
MACH_SUNxI symbol. This effectively hides these drivers when building
an ARCH=arm64 kernel. However, the A83T CCU still shows up because it
is missing this dependency. Let's add it for consistency.
