power: supply: bq27xxx: Fix kernel crash on IRQ handler register error

When registering the IRQ handler fails, do not just return the error code,
this will free the devm_kzalloc()-ed data struct while leaving the queued
work queued and the registered power_supply registered with both of them
now pointing to free-ed memory, resulting in various kernel crashes
soon afterwards.

Instead properly tear-down things on IRQ handler register errors.
