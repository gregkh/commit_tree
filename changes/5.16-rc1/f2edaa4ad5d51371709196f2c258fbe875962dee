net: virtio: use eth_hw_addr_set()

Commit 406f42fa0d3c ("net-next: When a bond have a massive amount
of VLANs...") introduced a rbtree for faster Ethernet address look
up. To maintain netdev->dev_addr in this tree we need to make all
the writes to it go through appropriate helpers.

Even though the current code uses dev->addr_len the we can switch
to eth_hw_addr_set() instead of dev_addr_set(). The netdev is
always allocated by alloc_etherdev_mq() and there are at least two
places which assume Ethernet address:
 - the line below calling eth_hw_addr_random()
 - virtnet_set_mac_address() -> eth_commit_mac_addr_change()
