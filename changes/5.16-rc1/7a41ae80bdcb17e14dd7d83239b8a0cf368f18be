PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Fix emulation of W1C bits

The pci_bridge_emul_conf_write() function correctly clears W1C bits in
cfgspace cache, but it does not inform the underlying implementation
about the clear request: the .write_op() method is given the value with
these bits cleared.

This is wrong if the .write_op() needs to know which bits were requested
to be cleared.

Fix the value to be passed into the .write_op() method to have requested
W1C bits set, so that it can clear them.

Both pci-bridge-emul users (mvebu and aardvark) are compatible with this
change.
