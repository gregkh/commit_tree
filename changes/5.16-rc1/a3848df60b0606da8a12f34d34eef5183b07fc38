drm/amd/amdgpu: Do irq_fini_hw after ip_fini_early

[Why]
drm_irq_uninstall is called in irq_fini_hw so that irq is disabled in sw
stage. SMU (and maybe other IP blocks) fini_hw will call irq_put for
cleanup and the whole cleanup process will be skipped because of
drm->irq_enable = false.

[How]
Move ip_fini_early before irq_fini_hw.
