KVM: nVMX: Clean up x2APIC MSR handling for L2

Clean up the x2APIC MSR bitmap intereption code for L2, which is the last
holdout of open coded bitmap manipulations.  Freshen up the SDM/PRM
comment, rename the function to make it abundantly clear the funky
behavior is x2APIC specific, and explain _why_ vmcs01's bitmap is ignored
(the previous comment was flat out wrong for x2APIC behavior).

No functional change intended.
