io_uring: utilize the io batching infrastructure for more efficient polled IO

Wire up using an io_comp_batch for f_op->iopoll(). If the lower stack
supports it, we can handle high rates of polled IO more efficiently.

This raises the single core efficiency on my system from ~6.1M IOPS to
~6.6M IOPS running a random read workload at depth 128 on two gen2
Optane drives.
