net: bcmgenet: remove netif_carrier_off from adjust_link

The bcmgenet_mii_setup() function is registered as the adjust_link
callback from the phylib for the GENET driver.

The phylib always sets the netif_carrier according to phydev->link
prior to invoking the adjust_link callback, so there is no need to
repeat that in the link down case within the network driver.
