kasan: Extend KASAN mode kernel parameter

Architectures supported by KASAN_HW_TAGS can provide an asymmetric mode
of execution. On an MTE enabled arm64 hw for example this can be
identified with the asymmetric tagging mode of execution. In particular,
when such a mode is present, the CPU triggers a fault on a tag mismatch
during a load operation and asynchronously updates a register when a tag
mismatch is detected during a store operation.

Extend the KASAN HW execution mode kernel command line parameter to
support asymmetric mode.
