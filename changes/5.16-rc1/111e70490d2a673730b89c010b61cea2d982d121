exit/kthread: Have kernel threads return instead of calling do_exit

In 2009 Oleg reworked[1] the kernel threads so that it is not
necessary to call do_exit if you are not using kthread_stop().  Remove
the explicit calls of do_exit and complete_and_exit (with a NULL
completion) that were previously necessary.
