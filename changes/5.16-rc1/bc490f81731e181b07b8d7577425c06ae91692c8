block: change plugging to use a singly linked list

Use a singly linked list for the blk_plug. This saves 8 bytes in the
blk_plug struct, and makes for faster list manipulations than doubly
linked lists. As we don't use the doubly linked lists for anything,
singly linked is just fine.

This yields a bump in default (merging enabled) performance from 7.0
to 7.1M IOPS, and ~7.5M IOPS with merging disabled.
