scsi: core: Fix early registration of sysfs attributes for scsi_device

v4.17 commit 86b87cde0b55 ("scsi: core: host template attribute groups")
introduced explicit sysfs_create_groups() in scsi_sysfs_add_sdev()
and sysfs_remove_groups() in __scsi_remove_device(), both for sdev_gendev,
based on a new field const struct attribute_group **sdev_groups
of struct scsi_host_template.

Commit 92c4b58b15c5 ("scsi: core: Register sysfs attributes earlier")
removed above explicit (de)registration of scsi_device attribute groups.
It also converted all scsi_device attributes and attribute_groups to
end up in a new field const struct attribute_group *gendev_attr_groups[6]
of struct scsi_device. However, that new field was not used anywhere.

Surprisingly, this only caused missing LLDD specific scsi_device sysfs
attributes. Whereas, scsi core attributes from scsi_sdev_attr_groups
did continue to exist because of scsi_dev_type.groups.

We separate scsi core attibutes from LLDD specific attributes.
Hence, we keep the initializing assignment scsi_dev_type =
{ .groups = scsi_sdev_attr_groups, } as this takes care of core
attributes. Without the separation, it would cause attribute double
registration due to scsi_dev_type.groups and sdev_gendev.groups.

Julian suggested to assign the sdev_groups pointer of the
scsi_host_template directly to the groups pointer of sdev_gendev.
This way we can delete the container scsi_device.gendev_attr_groups
and the loop copying each entry from hostt->sdev_groups to
sdev->gendev_attr_groups.

Alternative approaches ruled out:
Assigning gendev_attr_groups to sdev_dev has no visible effect.
Assigning sdev->gendev_attr_groups to scsi_dev_type.groups
caused scsi_device of all scsi host types to get LLDD specific
attributes of the LLDD for which the last sdev alloc happened to occur,
as that overwrote scsi_dev_type.groups,
e.g. scsi_debug had zfcp-specific scsi_device attributes.
