tracing: Place trace_pid_list logic into abstract functions

Instead of having the logic that does trace_pid_list open coded, wrap it in
abstract functions. This will allow a rewrite of the logic that implements
the trace_pid_list without affecting the users.

Note, this causes a change in behavior. Every time a pid is written into
the set_*_pid file, it creates a new list and uses RCU to update it. If
pid_max is lowered, but there was a pid currently in the list that was
higher than pid_max, those pids will now be removed on updating the list.
The old behavior kept that from happening.

The rewrite of the pid_list logic will no longer depend on pid_max,
and will return the old behavior.
