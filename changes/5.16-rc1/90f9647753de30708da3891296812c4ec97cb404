iio: adc: aspeed: Fix the calculate error of clock.

The ADC clock formula is
ast2400/2500:
ADC clock period = PCLK * 2 * (ADC0C[31:17] + 1) * (ADC0C[9:0] + 1)
ast2600:
ADC clock period = PCLK * 2 * (ADC0C[15:0] + 1)
They all have one fixed divided 2 and the legacy driver didn't handle it.
This patch register the fixed factory clock device as the parent of ADC
clock scaler to fix this issue.
