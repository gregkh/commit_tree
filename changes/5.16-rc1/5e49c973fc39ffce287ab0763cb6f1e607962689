io_uring: clean up io_import_iovec

Make io_import_iovec taking struct io_rw_state instead of an iter
pointer. First it takes care of initialising iovec pointer, which can be
forgotten. Even more, we can not init it if not needed, e.g. in case of
IORING_OP_READ_FIXED or IORING_OP_READ. Also hide saving iter_state
inside of it by splitting out an inline function of it to avoid extra
ifs.
