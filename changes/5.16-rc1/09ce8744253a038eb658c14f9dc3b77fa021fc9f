block: use flags instead of bit fields for blkdev_dio

This generates a lot better code for me, and bumps performance from
7650K IOPS to 7750K IOPS. Looking at profiles for the run and running
perf diff, it confirms that we're now sending a lot less time there:

     6.38%     -2.80%  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] blkdev_direct_IO

Taking it from the 2nd most cycle consumer to only the 9th most at
3.35% of the CPU time.
