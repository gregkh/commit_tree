xfs: rename m_ag_maxlevels to m_allocbt_maxlevels

Years ago when XFS was thought to be much more simple, we introduced
m_ag_maxlevels to specify the maximum btree height of per-AG btrees for
a given filesystem mount.  Then we observed that inode btrees don't
actually have the same height and split that off; and now we have rmap
and refcount btrees with much different geometries and separate
maxlevels variables.

The 'ag' part of the name doesn't make much sense anymore, so rename
this to m_alloc_maxlevels to reinforce that this is the maximum height
of the *free space* btrees.  This sets us up for the next patch, which
will add a variable to track the maximum height of all AG btrees.

(Also take the opportunity to improve adjacent comments and fix minor
style problems.)
