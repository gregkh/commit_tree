bpftool: Switch to libbpf's hashmap for pinned paths of BPF objects

In order to show pinned paths for BPF programs, maps, or links when
listing them with the "-f" option, bpftool creates hash maps to store
all relevant paths under the bpffs. So far, it would rely on the
kernel implementation (from tools/include/linux/hashtable.h).

We can make bpftool rely on libbpf's implementation instead. The
motivation is to make bpftool less dependent of kernel headers, to ease
the path to a potential out-of-tree mirror, like libbpf has.

This commit is the first step of the conversion: the hash maps for
pinned paths for programs, maps, and links are converted to libbpf's
hashmap.{c,h}. Other hash maps used for the PIDs of process holding
references to BPF objects are left unchanged for now. On the build side,
this requires adding a dependency to a second header internal to libbpf,
and making it a dependency for the bootstrap bpftool version as well.
The rest of the changes are a rather straightforward conversion.
