staging: rtl8723bs: ignore unused wiphy_wowlan object warnings

The wake-on-wlan stub is unused when the device power management
functionality is disabled in the kernel, creating a warning when
building the driver.

drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/os_dep/ioctl_cfg80211.c:50:42: warning: ‘wowlan_stub’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]

Add the __maybe_unused annotation to silence this warning.
