drm/amdkfd: unregistered svm range not overlap with TTM range

When creating unregistered new svm range to recover retry fault, avoid
new svm range to overlap with ranges or userptr ranges managed by TTM,
otherwise svm migration will trigger TTM or userptr eviction, to evict
user queues unexpectedly.

Change helper amdgpu_ttm_tt_affect_userptr to return userptr which is
inside the range. Add helper svm_range_check_vm_userptr to scan all
userptr of the vm, and return overlap userptr bo start, last.
