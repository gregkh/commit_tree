btrfs: make btrfs_ref::real_root optional

Now that real_root is only used in ref-verify core gate it behind
CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_REF_VERIFY ifdef. This shrinks the size of pending
delayed refs by 8 bytes per ref, of which we can have many at any one
time depending on intensity of the workload. Also change the comment
about the member as it no longer deals with qgroups.
