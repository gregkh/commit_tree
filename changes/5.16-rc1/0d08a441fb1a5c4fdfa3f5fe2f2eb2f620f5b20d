ice: ndo_setup_tc implementation for PF

Implement ndo_setup_tc net device callback for TC HW offload on PF device.

ndo_setup_tc provides support for HW offloading various TC filters.
Add support for configuring the following filter with tc-flower:
- default L2 filters (src/dst mac addresses, ethertype, VLAN)
- variations of L3, L3+L4, L2+L3+L4 filters using advanced filters
(including ipv4 and ipv6 addresses).

Allow for adding/removing TC flows when PF device is configured in
eswitch switchdev mode. Two types of actions are supported at the
moment: FLOW_ACTION_DROP and FLOW_ACTION_REDIRECT.
