extcon: extcon-axp288: Use P-Unit semaphore lock for register accesses

use low level P-Unit semaphore lock for axp288 register
accesses directly and for more than one access a time,
to reduce the number of times this semaphore is locked
and released which is an expensive operation.

i2c-bus to the XPower is shared between the kernel and the
SoCs P-Unit. The P-Unit has a semaphore wich the kernel must
lock for axp288 register accesses. When the P-Unit semaphore
is locked CPU and GPU power states cannot change or the system
will freeze.

The P-Unit semaphore lock is already managed inside the regmap
access logic, but for each access the semaphore is locked and
released. So use directly iosf_mbi_(un)block_punit_i2c_access(),
we are safe in doing so because nested calls to the same
semaphore are turned to nops.
