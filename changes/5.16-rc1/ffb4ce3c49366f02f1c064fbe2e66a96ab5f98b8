KVM: selftests: Make memslot_perf_test arch independent

memslot_perf_test uses ucalls for synchronization between guest and
host. Ucalls API is architecture independent: tests do not need to know
details like what kind of exit they generate on a specific arch.  More
specifically, there is no need to check whether an exit is KVM_EXIT_IO
in x86 for the host to know that the exit is ucall related, as
get_ucall() already makes that check.

Change memslot_perf_test to not require specifying what exit does a
ucall generate. Also add a missing ucall_init.
