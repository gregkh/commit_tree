drm/amd/display: Update VCP X.Y logging to improve usefulness

[Why]
Recently debugging efforts have involved setting/checking the
X.Y value used during payload allocation. Current output for
Y was calculated with incorrect bitshift. Y value is also not
human readable.

[How]
Refactor logging into separate function. Fix Y calculation error
and format output to be human readable.
