io_uring: remove drain_active check from hot path

req->ctx->active_drain is a bit too expensive, partially because of two
dereferences. Do a trick, if we see it set in io_init_req(), set
REQ_F_FORCE_ASYNC and it automatically goes through a slower path where
we can catch it. It's nearly free to do in io_init_req() because there
is already ->restricted check and it's in the same byte of a bitmask.
