x86/smp: Remove unnecessary assignment to local var freq_scale

Coverity warns of an unused value in arch_scale_freq_tick():

  CID 100778 (#1 of 1): Unused value (UNUSED_VALUE)
  assigned_value: Assigning value 1024ULL to freq_scale here, but that stored
  value is overwritten before it can be used.

It was introduced by commit:

  e2b0d619b400a ("x86, sched: check for counters overflow in frequency invariant accounting")

Remove the variable initializer.
