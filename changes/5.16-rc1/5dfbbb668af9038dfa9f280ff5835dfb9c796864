KVM: PPC: Replace zero-length array with flexible array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use "flexible array members" [1] for these cases. The
older style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be
used[2].

Also, make use of the struct_size() helper in kzalloc().
