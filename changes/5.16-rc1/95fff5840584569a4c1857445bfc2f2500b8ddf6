ARM: config: multi v7: Add renamed symbols

These options were renamed in recent times. Add the new name so the
driver is built again, and drop the old name.

POWER_AVS was renamed POWER_AVS_OMAP in commit bca815d62054 ("PM: AVS:
smartreflex Move driver to soc specific drivers"). Add the new symbol.

QCOM_PM became ARM_QCOM_SPM_CPUIDLE in commit a871be6b8eee ("cpuidle: Convert
Qualcomm SPM driver to a generic CPUidle driver").

SND_MMP_SOC became CONFIG_SND_MMP_SOC_SSPA in commit a97e384ba78f ("ASoC:
mmp-sspa: Add Device Tree support"). Enable that instead.
