scsi: csiostor: Uninitialized data in csio_ln_vnp_read_cbfn()

This variable is just a temporary variable, used to do an endian
conversion.  The problem is that the last byte is not initialized.  After
the conversion is completely done, the last byte is discarded so it doesn't
cause a problem.  But static checkers and the KMSan runtime checker can
detect the uninitialized read and will complain about it.
