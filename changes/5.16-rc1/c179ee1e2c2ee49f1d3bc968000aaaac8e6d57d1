arm64: dts: imx8mq: fix the schema check errors

No functional changes, but the ranges should be grouped by region.
Otherwise, schema dtbs_check would report the following errors.

"/linux-imx/arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mq-evk.dt.yaml: pcie@33800000: ranges: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:

Refer to commit 281f1f99cf3a ("PCI: dwc: Detect number of iATU windows").
The num-viewport is not required anymore, remove them totally.
