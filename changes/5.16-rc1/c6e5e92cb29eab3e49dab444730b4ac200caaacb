regulator: dummy: Use devm_regulator_register()

debugfs code complained at boot time that

  debugfs: Directory 'reg-dummy-regulator-dummy' with parent 'regulator'
  already present!

if we compile kernel with DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE. The problem is that we
don't provide .remove() method for dummy_regulator_driver, which should
invoke regulator_unregister() on device teardown to properly free things.

Though it's harmless as dummy_pdev never gets unbound in practice, let's
use devm_regulator_register() to get rid of the inconsistency.
