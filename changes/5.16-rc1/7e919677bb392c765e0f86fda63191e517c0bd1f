PCI: dwc: Perform host_init() before registering msi

On the Qualcomm sc8180x platform the bootloader does something related
to PCI that leaves a pending "msi" interrupt, which with the current
ordering often fires before init has a chance to enable the clocks that
are necessary for the interrupt handler to access the hardware.

Move the host_init() call before the registration of the "msi" interrupt
handler to ensure the host driver has a chance to enable the clocks.

The assignment of the bridge's ops and child_ops is moved along, because
at least the TI Keystone driver overwrites these in its host_init
callback.
