RDMA/hns: Modify the value of MAX_LP_MSG_LEN to meet hardware compatibility

The upper limit of MAX_LP_MSG_LEN on HIP08 is 64K, and the upper limit on
HIP09 is 16K. Regardless of whether it is HIP08 or HIP09, only 16K will be
used. In order to ensure compatibility, it is unified to 16K.

Setting MAX_LP_MSG_LEN to 16K will not cause performance loss on HIP08.
