soc: qcom: smp2p: Add wakeup capability to SMP2P IRQ

Remote susbsystems notify fatal crash through smp2p interrupt.
When remoteproc crashes it can cause soc to come out of low power
state and may not allow again to enter in low power state until
crash is handled.

Mark smp2p interrupt wakeup capable so that interrupt handler is
executed and remoteproc crash can be handled in system  resume path.
This patch marks interrupt wakeup capable but keeps wakeup disabled
by default. User space can enable it based on its requirement for
wakeup from suspend.
