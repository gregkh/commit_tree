zram: introduce an aged idle interface

This change introduces an aged idle interface to the existing idle sysfs
file for zram.

When CONFIG_ZRAM_MEMORY_TRACKING is enabled the idle file now also
accepts an integer argument.  This integer is the age (in seconds) of
pages to mark as idle.  The idle file still supports 'all' as it always
has.  This new approach allows for much more control over which pages
get marked as idle.
