btrfs: subpage: make extent_write_locked_range() compatible

There are two sites are not subpage compatible yet for
extent_write_locked_range():

- How @nr_pages are calculated
  For subpage we can have the following range with 64K page size:

  0   32K  64K   96K 128K
  |   |////|/////|   |

  In that case, although 96K - 32K == 64K, thus it looks like one page
  is enough, but the range spans two pages, not one.

  Fix it by doing proper round_up() and round_down() to calculate
  @nr_pages.

  Also add some extra ASSERT()s to ensure the range passed in is already
  aligned.

- How the page end is calculated
  Currently we just use cur + PAGE_SIZE - 1 to calculate the page end.

  Which can't handle the above range layout, and will trigger ASSERT()
  in btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered(), as the range is no longer
  covered by the page range.

  Fix it by taking page end into consideration.
