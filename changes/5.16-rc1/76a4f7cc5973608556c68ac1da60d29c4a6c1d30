scsi: mpi3mr: Clean up mpi3mr_print_ioc_info()

This function is more complicated than necessary.

If we change from scnprintf() to snprintf() that lets us remove the if
bytes_wrote < sizeof(protocol) checks.  Also, we can use bytes_wrote ? ","
: "" to print the comma and remove the separate if statement and the
"is_string_nonempty" variable.

[mkp: a few formatting cleanups and s/wrote/written/]
