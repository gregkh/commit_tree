clk: qcom: gpucc-msm8998: Remove unnecessary fallbacks to global clocks

A previous patch removes the "xo" clock from the global namespace making
it impossible to acquire by that ".name".  The device-tree for msm8998
already provides the "xo" and "gpll0" clock since the addition of the
gpucc node making it unnecessary to have this fallback at all.
