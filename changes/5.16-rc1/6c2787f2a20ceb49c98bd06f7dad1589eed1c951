locking: Remove rcu_read_{,un}lock() for preempt_{dis,en}able()

preempt_disable/enable() is equal to RCU read-side crital section, and
the spinning codes in mutex and rwsem could ensure that the preemption
is disabled. So let's remove the unnecessary rcu_read_lock/unlock for
saving some cycles in hot codes.
