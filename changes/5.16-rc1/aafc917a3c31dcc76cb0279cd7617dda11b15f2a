sched/fair: Carve out logic to mark a group for asymmetric packing

Create a separate function, sched_asym(). A subsequent changeset will
introduce logic to deal with SMT in conjunction with asmymmetric
packing. Such logic will need the statistics of the scheduling
group provided as argument. Update them before calling sched_asym().
