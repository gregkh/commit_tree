octeontx2-pf: Enable promisc/allmulti match MCAM entries.

Whenever the interface is brought up/down then set_rx_mode
function is called by the stack which enables promisc/allmulti
MCAM entries. But there are cases when driver brings
interface down and then up such as while changing number
of channels. In these cases promisc/allmulti MCAM entries
are left disabled as set_rx_mode callback is not called.
This patch enables these MCAM entries in all such cases.
