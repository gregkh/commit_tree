memory: fsl_ifc: fix leak of irq and nand_irq in fsl_ifc_ctrl_probe

The error handling code of fsl_ifc_ctrl_probe is problematic. When
fsl_ifc_ctrl_init fails or request_irq of fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev->irq fails,
it forgets to free the irq and nand_irq. Meanwhile, if request_irq of
fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev->nand_irq fails, it will still free nand_irq even if
the request_irq is not successful.

Fix this by refactoring the error handling code.
