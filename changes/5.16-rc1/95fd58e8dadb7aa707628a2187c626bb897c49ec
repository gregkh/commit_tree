sched/dl: Support sched_stat_runtime tracepoint for deadline sched class

The runtime of a DL task has already been there, so we only need to
add a tracepoint.

One difference between fair task and DL task is that there is no vruntime
in dl task. To reuse the sched_stat_runtime tracepoint, '0' is passed as
vruntime for DL task.

The output of this tracepoint for DL task as follows,
             top-36462   [047] d.h.  6083.452103: sched_stat_runtime: comm=top pid=36462 runtime=409898 [ns] vruntime=0 [ns]
