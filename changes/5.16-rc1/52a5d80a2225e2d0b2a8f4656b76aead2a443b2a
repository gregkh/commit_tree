kunit: tool: fix typecheck errors about loading qemu configs

Currently, we have these errors:
$ mypy ./tools/testing/kunit/*.py
tools/testing/kunit/kunit_kernel.py:213: error: Item "_Loader" of "Optional[_Loader]" has no attribute "exec_module"
tools/testing/kunit/kunit_kernel.py:213: error: Item "None" of "Optional[_Loader]" has no attribute "exec_module"
tools/testing/kunit/kunit_kernel.py:214: error: Module has no attribute "QEMU_ARCH"
tools/testing/kunit/kunit_kernel.py:215: error: Module has no attribute "QEMU_ARCH"

exec_module
===========

pytype currently reports no errors, but that's because there's a comment
disabling it on 213.

This is due to https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/2626.
The fix is to assert the loaded module implements the ABC
(abstract base class) we want which has exec_module support.

QEMU_ARCH
=========

pytype is fine with this, but mypy is not:
https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5059

Add a check that the loaded module does indeed have QEMU_ARCH.
Note: this is not enough to appease mypy, so we also add a comment to
squash the warning.
