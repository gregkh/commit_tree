drm/nouveau: Add a dedicated mutex for the clients list

Rather than protecting the nouveau_drm clients list with the lock within
the "client" nouveau_cli, add a dedicated lock to serialize access to
the list. This is both clearer and necessary to avoid lockdep being
upset with us when we need to iterate through all the clients in the
list and potentially lock their mutex, which is the same class as the
lock protecting the entire list.
