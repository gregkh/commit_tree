wilc1000: configure registers to handle chip wakeup sequence

Use the correct sequence to configure clockless registers for chip wake-up.
The following sequence is expected from WILC chip for wakeup:
 - set wakeup bit in wakeup_reg register
 - after setting the wakeup bit, read back the clock status bit for wakeup
   complete.

For SDIO/SPI modules, the wakeup sequence is the same except uses different
register values so refactored the code to use common function for both
SDIO/SPI bus.
