bpf/tests: Expand branch conversion JIT test

This patch expands the branch conversion test introduced by 66e5eb84
("bpf, tests: Add branch conversion JIT test"). The test now includes
a JMP with maximum eBPF offset. This triggers branch conversion for the
64-bit MIPS JIT. Additional variants are also added for cases when the
branch is taken or not taken.
