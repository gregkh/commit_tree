selftests/vm: make MADV_POPULATE_(READ|WRITE) use in-tree headers

The madv_populate selftest currently builds with a warning when the
local installed headers (via the distribution) don't include
MADV_POPULATE_READ and MADV_POPULATE_WRITE.  The warning is correct,
because the test cannot locate the necessary header.

The reason is that the in-tree installed headers (usr/include) have a
"linux" instead of a "sys" subdirectory.

Including "linux/mman.h" instead of "sys/mman.h" doesn't work (e.g.,
mmap() and madvise() are not defined that way).  The only thing that
seems to work is including "linux/mman.h" in addition to "sys/mman.h".

We can get rid of our availability check and simplify.
