drm/i915: Ensure wa_init_finish() is called for ctx workaround list

A recent restructuring of our context workaround list initialization
added an early return for non-render engines; this caused us to
potentially miss the wa_init_finish() call at the end of the function.
The mistake is pretty harmless --- the only impact is that non-render
engines on graphics version 12.50+ platforms we don't trim down the
workaround list to reclaim some memory, and we don't print the usual
"Initialized 1 context workaround" message in dmesg.  Let's change the
early return to a jump down to the wa_init_finish() call at the bottom
of the function.
