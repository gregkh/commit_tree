media: rcar-vin: Remove explicit device availability check

The fwnode is retrieved using fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id() without
the FWNODE_GRAPH_DEVICE_DISABLED flag set. So there is no need to
explicitly check if the fwnode is available as it always will be when
the check is performed, remove it.
