drm/amdgpu:  Get atomicOps info from Host for sriov setup

The AtomicOp Requester Enable bit is reserved in VFs and the PF value applies to all
associated VFs. so guest driver can not directly enable the atomicOps for VF, it
depends on PF to enable it. In current design, amdgpu driver  will get the enabled
atomicOps bits through private pf2vf data
