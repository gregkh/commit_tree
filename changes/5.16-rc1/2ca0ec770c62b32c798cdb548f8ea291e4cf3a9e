btrfs: zoned: use greedy gc for auto reclaim

Currently auto reclaim of unusable zones reclaims the block-groups in
the order they have been added to the reclaim list.

Change this to a greedy algorithm by sorting the list so we have the
block-groups with the least amount of valid bytes reclaimed first.

Note: we can't splice the block groups from reclaim_bgs to let the sort
happen outside of the lock. The block groups can be still in use by
other parts eg. via bg_list and we must hold unused_bgs_lock while
processing them.
