gfs2: Move the inode glock locking to gfs2_file_buffered_write

So far, for buffered writes, we were taking the inode glock in
gfs2_iomap_begin and dropping it in gfs2_iomap_end with the intention of
not holding the inode glock while iomap_write_actor faults in user
pages.  It turns out that iomap_write_actor is called inside iomap_begin
... iomap_end, so the user pages were still faulted in while holding the
inode glock and the locking code in iomap_begin / iomap_end was
completely pointless.

Move the locking into gfs2_file_buffered_write instead.  We'll take care
of the potential deadlocks due to faulting in user pages while holding a
glock in a subsequent patch.
