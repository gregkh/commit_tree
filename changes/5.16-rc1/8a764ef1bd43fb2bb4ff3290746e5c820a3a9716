selinux: enable genfscon labeling for securityfs

Add support for genfscon per-file labeling of securityfs files.
This allows for separate labels and thereby access control for
different files. For example a genfscon statement

    genfscon securityfs /integrity/ima/policy \
	system_u:object_r:ima_policy_t:s0

will set a private label to the IMA policy file and thus allow to
control the ability to set the IMA policy. Setting labels directly
with setxattr(2), e.g. by chcon(1) or setfiles(8), is still not
supported.
