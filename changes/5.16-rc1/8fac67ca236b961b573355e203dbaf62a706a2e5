arm64: mm: update max_pfn after memory hotplug

After new memory blocks have been hotplugged, max_pfn and max_low_pfn
needs updating to reflect on new PFNs being hot added to system.
Without this patch, debug-related functions that use max_pfn such as
get_max_dump_pfn() or read_page_owner() will not work with any page in
memory that is hot-added after boot.
