rpmsg: glink: Remove channel decouple from rpdev release

If a channel is being rapidly restarting and the kobj release worker is
busy, there is a chance the rpdev_release function will run after the
channel struct itself has been released.

There should not be a need to decouple the channel from rpdev in the
rpdev release since that should only happen from the close commands.
