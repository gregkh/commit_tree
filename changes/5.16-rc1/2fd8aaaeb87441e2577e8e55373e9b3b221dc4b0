iwlwifi: pcie: try to grab NIC access early

Sometimes some NICs may fail to initialize, but if we have
such a scenario we may only see an alive timeout (i.e. the
firmware doesn't send us the alive message), and that will
only cause us to fail the interface up.

Try to once grab NIC access during device probe to ensure
we can properly talk to the hardware at all, and to do all
the potential workarounds in that function.

Since we now finish NIC init here, we can remove it from
the later potential read of the RF ID.
