KVM: x86: Add vendor name to kvm_x86_ops, use it for error messages

Paul pointed out the error messages when KVM fails to load are unhelpful
in understanding exactly what went wrong if userspace probes the "wrong"
module.

Add a mandatory kvm_x86_ops field to track vendor module names, kvm_intel
and kvm_amd, and use the name for relevant error message when KVM fails
to load so that the user knows which module failed to load.

Opportunistically tweak the "disabled by bios" error message to clarify
that _support_ was disabled, not that the module itself was magically
disabled by BIOS.
