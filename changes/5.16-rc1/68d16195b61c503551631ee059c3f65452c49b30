of: Support using 'mask' in making device bus id

Commit 25b892b583cc ("ARM: dts: arm: Update register-bit-led nodes
'reg' and node names") added a 'reg' property to nodes. This change has
the side effect of changing how the kernel generates the device name.
The assumption was a translatable 'reg' address is unique. However, in
the case of the register-bit-led binding (and a few others) that is not
the case. The 'mask' property must also be used in this case to make a
unique device name.
