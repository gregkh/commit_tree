mctp: handle the struct sockaddr_mctp padding fields

In order to have the padding fields actually usable in the future,
there have to be checks that user space doesn't supply non-zero garbage
there.  It is also worth setting these padding fields to zero, unless
it is known that they have been already zeroed.
