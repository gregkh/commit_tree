net, neigh: Add build-time assertion to avoid neigh->flags overflow

Currently, NDA_FLAGS_EXT flags allow a maximum of 24 bits to be used for
extended neighbor flags. These are eventually fed into neigh->flags by
shifting with NTF_EXT_SHIFT as per commit 2c611ad97a82 ("net, neigh:
Extend neigh->flags to 32 bit to allow for extensions").

If really ever needed in future, the full 32 bits from NDA_FLAGS_EXT can
be used, it would only require to move neigh->flags from u32 to u64 inside
the kernel.

Add a build-time assertion such that when extending the NTF_EXT_MASK with
new bits, we'll trigger an error once we surpass the 24th bit. This assumes
that no bit holes in new NTF_EXT_* flags will slip in from UAPI, but I
think this is reasonable to assume.
