virtio_blk: correct types for status handling

virtblk_setup_cmd returns blk_status_t in an int, callers then assign it
back to a blk_status_t variable. blk_status_t is either u32 or (more
typically) u8 so it works, but is inelegant and causes sparse warnings.

Pass the status in blk_status_t in a consistent way.
