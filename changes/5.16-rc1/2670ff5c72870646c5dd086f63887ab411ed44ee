drm/i915/fbc: Polish the skl+ FBC stride override handling

Polish the FBC stride override stuff:
- just call it override_cfb_stride since it'll be used on
  more gens later
- Use REG_BIT() & co. for the registers and give everything
  CHICKEN_ prefix since glk+ will have a different register
  for this
- Use intel_de_rmw() for the RMW
