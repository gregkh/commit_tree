btrfs: remove btrfs_bio::logical member

The member btrfs_bio::logical is only initialized by two call sites:

- btrfs_repair_one_sector()
  No corresponding site to utilize it.

- btrfs_submit_direct()
  The corresponding site to utilize it is btrfs_check_read_dio_bio().

However for btrfs_check_read_dio_bio(), we can grab the file_offset from
btrfs_dio_private::file_offset directly.

Thus it turns out we don't really need that btrfs_bio::logical member at
all.

For btrfs_bio, the logical bytenr can be fetched from its
bio->bi_iter.bi_sector directly.

So let's just remove the member to save 8 bytes for structure btrfs_bio.
