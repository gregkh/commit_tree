net/mlx4_en: avoid one cache line miss to ring doorbell

This patch caches doorbell address directly in struct mlx4_en_tx_ring.

This removes the need to bring in cpu caches whole struct mlx4_uar
in fast path.

Note that mlx4_uar is not guaranteed to be on a local node,
because mlx4_bf_alloc() uses a single free list (priv->bf_list)
regardless of its node parameter.

This kind of change does matter in presence of light/moderate traffic.
In high stress, this read-only line would be kept hot in caches.
