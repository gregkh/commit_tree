s390: support command lines longer than 896 bytes

Currently s390 supports a fixed maximum command line length of 896
bytes. This isn't enough as some installers are trying to pass all
configuration data via kernel command line, and even with zfcp alone
it is easy to generate really long command lines. Therefore extend
the command line to 4 kbytes.

In the parm area where the command line is stored there is no indication
of the maximum allowed length, so a new field which contains the maximum
length is added.

The parm area has always been initialized to zero, so with old kernels
this field would read zero. This is important because tools like zipl
could read this field. If it contains a number larger than zero zipl
knows the maximum length that can be stored in the parm area, otherwise
it must assume that it is booting a legacy kernel and only 896 bytes are
available.

The removing of trailing whitespace in head.S is also removed because
code to do this is already present in setup_boot_command_line().
