tcp: tracking packets with CE marks in BW rate sample

In order to track CE marks per rate sample (one round trip), TCP needs a
per-skb header field to record the tp->delivered_ce count when the skb
was sent. To make space, we replace the "last_in_flight" field which is
used exclusively for NV congestion control. The stat needed by NV can be
alternatively approximated by existing stats tcp_sock delivered and
mss_cache.

This patch counts the number of packets delivered which have CE marks in
the rate sample, using similar approach of delivery accounting.
