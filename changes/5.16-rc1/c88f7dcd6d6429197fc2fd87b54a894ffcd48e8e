cifs: support nested dfs links over reconnect

Mounting a dfs link that has nested links was already supported at
mount(2), so make it work over reconnect as well.

Make the following case work:

* mount //root/dfs/link /mnt -o ...
  - final share: /server/share

* in server settings
  - change target folder of /root/dfs/link3 to /server/share2
  - change target folder of /root/dfs/link2 to /root/dfs/link3
  - change target folder of /root/dfs/link to /root/dfs/link2

* mount -o remount,... /mnt
 - refresh all dfs referrals
 - mark current connection for failover
 - cifs_reconnect() reconnects to root server
 - tree_connect()
   * checks that /root/dfs/link2 is a link, then chase it
   * checks that root/dfs/link3 is a link, then chase it
   * finally tree connect to /server/share2

If the mounted share is no longer accessible and a reconnect had been
triggered, the client will retry it from both last referral
path (/root/dfs/link3) and original referral path (/root/dfs/link).

Any new referral paths found while chasing dfs links over reconnect,
it will be updated to TCP_Server_Info::leaf_fullpath, accordingly.
