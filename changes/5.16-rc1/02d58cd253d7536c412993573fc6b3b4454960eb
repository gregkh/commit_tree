f2fs: compress: disallow disabling compress on non-empty compressed file

Compresse file and normal file has differ in i_addr addressing,
specifically addrs per inode/block. So, we will face data loss, if we
disable the compression flag on non-empty files. Therefore we should
disallow not only enabling but disabling the compression flag on
non-empty files.
