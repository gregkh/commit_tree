PCI: kirin: Support PERST# GPIOs for HiKey970 external PEX 8606 bridge

On HiKey970, there's a PEX 8606 PCI bridge on its PHY with 6 lanes. Only 4
lanes are connected:

  lane 0 - connected to Kirin 970 (upstream)
  lane 4 - M.2 slot
  lane 5 - mini PCIe slot
  lane 6 - on-board Ethernet controller

Each lane has its own PERST# GPIO pin and needs a clock request.

Add support to parse a DT schema containing the above data.

HiKey 970 requires a little more waiting time for the PCI bridge - which is
outside the SoC - to finish the PERST# reset, and then initialize the eye
diagram.

Increase the waiting time for the PERST# signals accordingly.
