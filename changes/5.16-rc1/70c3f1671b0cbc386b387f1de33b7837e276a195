x86/fpu/xstate: Prepare XSAVE feature table for gaps in state component numbers

The kernel checks at boot time which features are available by walking a
XSAVE feature table which contains the CPUID feature bit numbers which need
to be checked whether a feature is available on a CPU or not. So far the
feature numbers have been linear, but AMX will create a gap which the
current code cannot handle.

Make the table entries explicitly indexed and adjust the loop code
accordingly to prepare for that.

No functional change.
