KVM: arm64: vgic: Add memcg accounting to vgic allocations

Inspired by commit 254272ce6505 ("kvm: x86: Add memcg accounting to KVM
allocations"), it would be better to make arm64 vgic consistent with
common kvm codes.

The memory allocations of VM scope should be charged into VM process
cgroup, hence change GFP_KERNEL to GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT.

There remain a few cases since these allocations are global, not in VM
scope.
