clk: qcom: gcc-msm8996: Drop (again) gcc_aggre1_pnoc_ahb_clk

The gcc_aggre1_pnoc_ahb_clk is crucial for the proper MSM8996/APQ8096
functioning. If it gets disabled, several subsytems will stop working
(including eMMC/SDCC and USB). There are no in-kernel users of this
clock, so it is much simpler to remove from the kernel.

The clock was first removed in the commit 9e60de1cf270 ("clk: qcom:
Remove gcc_aggre1_pnoc_ahb_clk from msm8996") by Stephen Boyd, but got
added back in the commit b567752144e3 ("clk: qcom: Add some missing gcc
clks for msm8996") by Rajendra Nayak.

Let's remove it again in hope that nobody adds it back.
