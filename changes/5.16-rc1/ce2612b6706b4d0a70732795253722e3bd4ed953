x86/smp: Factor out parts of native_smp_prepare_cpus()

Commit 66558b730f25 ("sched: Add cluster scheduler level for x86")
introduced cpu_l2c_shared_map mask which is expected to be initialized
by smp_op.smp_prepare_cpus(). That commit only updated
native_smp_prepare_cpus() version but not xen_pv_smp_prepare_cpus().
As result Xen PV guests crash in set_cpu_sibling_map().

While the new mask can be allocated in xen_pv_smp_prepare_cpus() one can
see that both versions of smp_prepare_cpus ops share a number of common
operations that can be factored out. So do that instead.
