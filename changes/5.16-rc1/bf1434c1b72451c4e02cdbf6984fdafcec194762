mxser: simplify FCR computation in mxser_change_speed()

Provided FIFO is always enabled for MUST chips, move its FCR setting out
of PORT_8250/PORT_16450 special case in mxser_change_speed(). Now, we
can pre-set fcr to zero and invert the condition of the 'if'.

This makes the code more readable (no functional change intended).
