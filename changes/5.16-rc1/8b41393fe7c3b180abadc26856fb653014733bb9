btrfs: do not call close_fs_devices in btrfs_rm_device

There's a subtle case where if we're removing the seed device from a
file system we need to free its private copy of the fs_devices.  However
we do not need to call close_fs_devices(), because at this point there
are no devices left to close as we've closed the last one.  The only
thing that close_fs_devices() does is decrement ->opened, which should
be 1.  We want to avoid calling close_fs_devices() here because it has a
lockdep_assert_held(&uuid_mutex), and we are going to stop holding the
uuid_mutex in this path.

So simply decrement the  ->opened counter like we should, and then clean
up like normal.  Also add a comment explaining what we're doing here as
I initially removed this code erroneously.
