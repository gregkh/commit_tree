memory: mtk-smi: Rename smi_gen to smi_type

Prepare for adding smi sub common. Only rename from smi_gen to smi_type.
No functional change.

About the current "smi_gen", we have gen1/gen2 that stand for the
generation number for HW. I plan to add a new type(sub_common), then the
name "gen" is not proper.
