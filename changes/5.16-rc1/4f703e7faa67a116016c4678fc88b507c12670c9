powerpc/s64: Clarify that radix lacks DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

The page_alloc.c code will call into __kernel_map_pages() when
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is configured and enabled.

As the implementation assumes hash, this should crash spectacularly if
not for a bit of luck in __kernel_map_pages(). In this function
linear_map_hash_count is always zero, the for loop exits without doing
any damage.

There are no other platforms that determine if they support
debug_pagealloc at runtime. Instead of adding code to mm/page_alloc.c to
do that, this change turns the map/unmap into a noop when in radix
mode and prints a warning once.
