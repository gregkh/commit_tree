mm: memcontrol: remove kmemcg_id reparenting

Since slab objects and kmem pages are charged to object cgroup instead
of memory cgroup, memcg_reparent_objcgs() will reparent this cgroup and
all its descendants to its parent cgroup.  This already makes further
list_lru_add()'s add elements to the parent's list.  So it is
unnecessary to change kmemcg_id of an offline cgroup to its parent's id.
It just wastes CPU cycles.  Just remove the redundant code.
