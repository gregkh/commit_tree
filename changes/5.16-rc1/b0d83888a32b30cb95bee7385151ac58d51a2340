drm/i915/guc: Release submit fence from an irq_work

A subsequent patch will flip the locking hierarchy from
ce->guc_state.lock -> sched_engine->lock to sched_engine->lock ->
ce->guc_state.lock. As such we need to release the submit fence for a
request from an IRQ to break a lock inversion - i.e. the fence must be
release went holding ce->guc_state.lock and the releasing of the can
acquire sched_engine->lock.

v2:
 (Daniele)
  - Delete request from list before calling irq_work_queue
