staging: r8188eu: remove two checks that are always false

Commit aefb1fc5c185 ("staging: r8188eu: odm BoardType is never set")
clarified that the odm board type is always 0.

The CheckCondition functions extract the board type from the hex
parameter and stores it in _board. For _board == 0,
(_board == cond) && cond != 0x00 is always false. Remove the checks.
