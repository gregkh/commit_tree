btrfs: add comments for device counts in struct btrfs_fs_devices

A bug was was checking a wrong device count before we delete the struct
btrfs_fs_devices in btrfs_rm_device(). To avoid future confusion and
easy reference add a comment about the various device counts that we have
in the struct btrfs_fs_devices.
