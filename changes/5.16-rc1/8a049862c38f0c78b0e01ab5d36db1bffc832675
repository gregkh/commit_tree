KVM: arm64: Fix early exit ptrauth handling

The previous rework of the early exit code to provide an EC-based
decoding tree missed the fact that we have two trap paths for
ptrauth: the instructions (EC_PAC) and the sysregs (EC_SYS64).

Rework the handlers to call the ptrauth handling code on both
paths.
