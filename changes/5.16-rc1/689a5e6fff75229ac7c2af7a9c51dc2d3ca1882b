ath11k: monitor mode clean up to use separate APIs

If monitor interface is enabled in co-exist mode, only local traffic are
captured. It's caused by missing monitor vdev in co-exist mode. So,
monitor mode clean up is done with separate Monitor APIs. For this,
introduce flags monitor_started and monitor_vdev_created.
