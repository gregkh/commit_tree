dmaengine: idxd: move out percpu_ref_exit() to ensure it's outside submission

percpu_ref_tryget_live() is safe to call as long as ref is between init and
exit according to the function comment. Move percpu_ref_exit() so it is
called after the dma channel is no longer valid to ensure this holds true.
