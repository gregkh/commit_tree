scftorture: Shut down if nonsensical arguments given

If (say) a 10-hour scftorture run is started, but the module parameters
are so nonsensical that the run doesn't even start, then scftorture will
wait the full ten hours when run built into a guest OS.  This commit
therefore shuts down the system in this case so that the error is reported
immediately instead of ten hours hence.
