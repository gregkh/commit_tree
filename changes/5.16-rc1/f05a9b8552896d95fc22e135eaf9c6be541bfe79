ASoC: rt1011: Fix 'I2S Reference' enum control

There are several things the patch adding the support for 'I2S Reference'
got wrong:
- "None" selection is in fact equals to last selected reference
- The custom put overrides RX/TX len, TDM slot sizes, etc
- the enum is useless in most part for the reference tracking
- there is no need for EXT control as there is a single bit in
  RT1011_TDM1_SET_1 register (bit 7) which selects the reference
- it was using ucontrol->value.integer.value[0] in the put/get callbacks
  which causesed access to 'I2S Reference' enum with alsamixer to fail
