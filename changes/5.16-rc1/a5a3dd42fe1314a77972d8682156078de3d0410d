drm/ttm: add some kernel-doc for TTM_TT_FLAG_*

Move it to inline kernel-doc, otherwise we can't add empty lines it
seems. Also drop the kernel-doc for pages_list, which doesn't seem to
exist.

v2(Christian):
  - Add a note that FLAG_SWAPPED shouldn't need to be touched by drivers.
  - Mention what FLAG_POPULATED does.
