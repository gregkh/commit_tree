- CQE match and flush fields are used to determine if to build new skb
  using the new received packet,
  or to add the received packet data to the existing RQ.hw_gro_skb,
  also this fields are used to determine when to flush the skb.
- in the end of the function mlx5e_poll_rx_cq the RQ.hw_gro_skb is flushed.
