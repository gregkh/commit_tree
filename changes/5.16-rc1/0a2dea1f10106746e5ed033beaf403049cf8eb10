ASoC: SOF: Add new fields to snd_sof_route

Add two new fields to save the source widget and sink widget
pointers in struct snd_sof_route to make it easier to look up
routes by source/sink widget. Also, add a flag to indicate
if the route has been set up in the DSP. These will be used
when the dynamic pipeline feature is implemented and routes
will have to be set up at run time.

Also, add a new sof_tear_down_pipelines() callback, that will
used to reset the set up status for all routes during suspend.
