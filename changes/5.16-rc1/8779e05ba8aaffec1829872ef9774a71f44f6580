parisc: Fix ptrace check on syscall return

The TIF_XXX flags are stored in the flags field in the thread_info
struct (TI_FLAGS), not in the flags field of the task_struct structure
(TASK_FLAGS).

It seems this bug didn't generate any important side-effects, otherwise it
wouldn't have went unnoticed for 12 years (since v2.6.32).
