virt: acrn: Introduce interfaces for virtual device creating/destroying

The ACRN hypervisor can emulate a virtual device within hypervisor for a
Guest VM. The emulated virtual device can work without the ACRN
userspace after creation. The hypervisor do the emulation of that device.

To support the virtual device creating/destroying, HSM provides the
following ioctls:
  - ACRN_IOCTL_CREATE_VDEV
    Pass data struct acrn_vdev from userspace to the hypervisor, and inform
    the hypervisor to create a virtual device for a User VM.
  - ACRN_IOCTL_DESTROY_VDEV
    Pass data struct acrn_vdev from userspace to the hypervisor, and inform
    the hypervisor to destroy a virtual device of a User VM.

These new APIs will be used by user space code vm_add_hv_vdev and
vm_remove_hv_vdev in
