net/mlx5e: Add handle SHAMPO cqe support

This patch adds the new CQE SHAMPO fields:
- flush: indicates that we must close the current session and pass the SKB
         to the network stack.

- match: indicates that the current packet matches the oppened session,
         the packet will be merge into the current SKB.

- header_size: the size of the packet headers that written into the headers
               buffer.

- header_entry_index: the entry index in the headers buffer.

- data_offset: packets data offset in the WQE.

Also new cqe handler is added to handle SHAMPO packets:
- The new handler uses CQE SHAMPO fields to build the SKB.
  CQE's Flush and match fields are not used in this patch, packets are not
  merged in this patch.
