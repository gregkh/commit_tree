s390: make command line configurable

Allow to configure the command line to an arbitrary length, with a
default of 4096 bytes. Also remove COMMAND_LINE_SIZE from
include/uapi/asm/setup.h as this is dynamic now and doesn't tell
anything about the command line size limitations of a new kernel
that might be loaded.
