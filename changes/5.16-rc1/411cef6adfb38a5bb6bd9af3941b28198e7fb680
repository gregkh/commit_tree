ALSA: mixer: oss: Fix racy access to slots

The OSS mixer can reassign the mapping slots dynamically via proc
file.  Although the addition and deletion of those slots are protected
by mixer->reg_mutex, the access to slots aren't, hence this may cause
UAF when the slots in use are deleted concurrently.

This patch applies the mixer->reg_mutex in all appropriate code paths
(i.e. the ioctl functions) that may access slots.
