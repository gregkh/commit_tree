drm/edid: Fix EDID quirk compile error on older compilers

Apparently some compilers [1] cannot handle doing math on dereferenced
string constants at compile time. This has led to reports [2] of
compile errors like:

  In file included from drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid.c:42:0:
  ./include/drm/drm_edid.h:525:2: error: initializer element is not constant
    ((((u32)((vend)[0]) - '@') & 0x1f) << 26 | \

Go back to the syntax I used in v4 of the patch series [3] that added
this code instead of what landed (v5). This syntax is slightly uglier
but should be much more compatible with varied compilers.
