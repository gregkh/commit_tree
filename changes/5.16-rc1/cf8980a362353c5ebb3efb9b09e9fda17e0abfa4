samples: bpf: Convert ARP table network order fields into readable format

The ARP table that is dumped when the xdp_router_ipv4 process is launched
has the IP address & MAC address in non-readable network byte order format,
also the alignment is off when printing the table.

Address HwAddress
160000e0                1600005e0001
ff96a8c0                ffffffffffff
faffffef                faff7f5e0001
196a8c0		9607871293ea
fb0000e0                fb00005e0001
0               0
196a8c0		9607871293ea
ffff11ac                ffffffffffff
faffffef                faff7f5e0001
fb0000e0                fb00005e0001
160000e0                1600005e0001
160000e0                1600005e0001
faffffef                faff7f5e0001
fb0000e0                fb00005e0001
40011ac         40011ac4202

Fix this by converting the "Address" field from network byte order Hex into
dotted decimal notation IPv4 format and "HwAddress" field from network byte
order Hex into Colon separated Hex format. Also fix the aligntment of the
fields in the ARP table.
