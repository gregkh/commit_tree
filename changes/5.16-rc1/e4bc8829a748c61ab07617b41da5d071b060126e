coresight: trbe: Allow driver to choose a different alignment

The TRBE hardware mandates a minimum alignment for the TRBPTR_EL1,
advertised via the TRBIDR_EL1. This is used by the driver to
align the buffer write head. This patch allows the driver to
choose a different alignment from that of the hardware, by
decoupling the alignment tracking. This will be useful for
working around errata.
