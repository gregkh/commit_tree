drm/i915/guc: Assign contexts in parent-child relationship consecutive guc_ids

Assign contexts in parent-child relationship consecutive guc_ids. This
is accomplished by partitioning guc_id space between ones that need to
be consecutive (1/16 available guc_ids) and ones that do not (15/16 of
available guc_ids). The consecutive search is implemented via the bitmap
API.

This is a precursor to the full GuC multi-lrc implementation but aligns
to how GuC mutli-lrc interface is defined - guc_ids must be consecutive
when using the GuC multi-lrc interface.

v2:
 (Daniel Vetter)
  - Explicitly state why we assign consecutive guc_ids
v3:
 (John Harrison)
  - Bring back in spin lock
