optee: add FF-A support

Adds support for using FF-A [1] as transport to the OP-TEE driver.

Introduces struct optee_msg_param_fmem which carries all information
needed when OP-TEE is calling FFA_MEM_RETRIEVE_REQ to get the shared
memory reference mapped by the hypervisor in S-EL2. Register usage is
also updated to include the information needed.

The FF-A part of this driver is enabled if CONFIG_ARM_FFA_TRANSPORT is
enabled.
