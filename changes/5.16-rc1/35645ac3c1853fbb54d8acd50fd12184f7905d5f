io_uring: combine REQ_F_NOWAIT_{READ,WRITE} flags

Merge REQ_F_NOWAIT_READ and REQ_F_NOWAIT_WRITE into one flag, i.e.
REQ_F_SUPPORT_NOWAIT. First it gets rid of dependence on CONFIG_64BIT
but also simplifies the code.

One thing to consider is when we don't have ->{read,write}_iter and go
through loop_rw_iter(). Just fail it with -EAGAIN if we expect nowait
behaviour but not sure whether it supports it.
