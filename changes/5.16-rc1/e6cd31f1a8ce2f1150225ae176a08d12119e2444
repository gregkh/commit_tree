kvm: x86: Convert return type of *is_valid_rdpmc_ecx() to bool

These function names sound like predicates, and they have siblings,
*is_valid_msr(), which _are_ predicates. Moreover, there are comments
that essentially warn that these functions behave unexpectedly.

Flip the polarity of the return values, so that they become
predicates, and convert the boolean result to a success/failure code
at the outer call site.
