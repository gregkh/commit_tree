drm/amdgpu: rework context priority handling

To get a hardware queue priority for a context, we are currently
mapping AMDGPU_CTX_PRIORITY_* to DRM_SCHED_PRIORITY_* and then
to hardware queue priority, which is not the right way to do that
as DRM_SCHED_PRIORITY_* is software scheduler's priority and it is
independent from a hardware queue priority.

Use userspace provided context priority, AMDGPU_CTX_PRIORITY_* to
map a context to proper hardware queue priority.
