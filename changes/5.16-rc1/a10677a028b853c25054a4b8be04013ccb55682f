crash_dump: remove duplicate include in crash_dump.h

In crash_dump.h, header file <linux/pgtable.h> is included twice.  This
duplication was introduced in commit 65fddcfca8ad("mm: reorder includes
after introduction of linux/pgtable.h") where the order of the header
files is adjusted, while the old one was not removed.

Clean it up here.
