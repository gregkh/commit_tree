habanalabs: define soft-reset as inference op

Soft-reset is the procedure where we reset only the compute/DMA engines
of the device, without requiring the current user-space process to
release the device.

This type of reset can happen if TDR event occurred (a workload got
stuck) or by a root request through sysfs.

This is only relevant for inference ASICs, as there is no real-world
use-case to do that in training, because training runs on multiple
devices.

In addition, we also do (in certain ASICs) a reset upon device release.
That reset uses the same code as the soft-reset.

Therefore, to better differentiate between the two resets, it is better
to rename the soft-reset support as "inference soft-reset", to make
the code more self-explanatory.
