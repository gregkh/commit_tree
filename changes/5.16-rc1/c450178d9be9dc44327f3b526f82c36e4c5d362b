io_uring: dedup CQE flushing non-empty checks

We don't do io_submit_flush_completions() when there is no requests
enqueued, and every single caller checks for it. Hide that check into
the function not forgetting about inlining. That will make it much
easier for changing the empty check condition in the future.
