net: phy: micrel: ksz9131 led errata workaround

Micrel KSZ9131 PHY LED behavior is not correct when configured in
Individual Mode, LED1 (Activity LED) is in the ON state when there is
no-link.

Workaround this by setting bit 9 of register 0x1e after verifying that
the LED configuration is Individual Mode.

This issue is described in KSZ9131RNX Silicon Errata DS80000693B [*]
and according to that it will not be corrected in a future silicon
revision.
