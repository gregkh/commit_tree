kernel-doc: support DECLARE_PHY_INTERFACE_MASK()

Support the DECLARE_PHY_INTERFACE_MASK() macro that is used to declare
a bitmap by converting the macro to DECLARE_BITMAP(), as has been done
for the __ETHTOOL_DECLARE_LINK_MODE_MASK() macro.

This fixes a 'make htmldocs' warning:

include/linux/phylink.h:82: warning: Function parameter or member 'DECLARE_PHY_INTERFACE_MASK(supported_interfaces' not described in 'phylink_config'

that was introduced by commit
  38c310eb46f5 ("net: phylink: add MAC phy_interface_t bitmap")
