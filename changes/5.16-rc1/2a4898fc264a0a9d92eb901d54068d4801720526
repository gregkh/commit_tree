perf tools: Add more weak libbpf functions

We hit the window where perf uses libbpf functions, that did not make it
to the official libbpf release yet and it's breaking perf build with
dynamicly linked libbpf.

Fixing this by providing the new interface as weak functions which calls
the original libbpf functions. Fortunatelly the changes were just
renames.
