selftests/bpf: Remove SEC("version") from test progs

Since commit 6c4fc209fcf9d ("bpf: remove useless version check for prog
load") these "version" sections, which result in bpf_attr.kern_version
being set, have been unnecessary.

Remove them so that it's obvious to folks using selftests as a guide that
"modern" BPF progs don't need this section.
