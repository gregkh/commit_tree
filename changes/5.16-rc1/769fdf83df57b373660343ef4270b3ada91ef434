sched: Fix DEBUG && !SCHEDSTATS warn

When !SCHEDSTATS schedstat_enabled() is an unconditional 0 and the
whole block doesn't exist, however GCC figures the scoped variable
'stats' is unused and complains about it.

Upgrade the warning from -Wunused-variable to -Wunused-but-set-variable
by writing it in two statements. This fixes the build because the new
warning is in W=1.

Given that whole if(0) {} thing, I don't feel motivated to change
things overly much and quite strongly feel this is the compiler being
daft.
