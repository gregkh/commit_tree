staging: r8188eu: remove rtw_hal_reset_security_engine function

Remove rtw_hal_reset_security_engine and its one caller from
hal/hal_intf.c, and remove its declaration from include/hal_intf.h as
well. This is just a wrapper function that calls the function pointer
hal_reset_security_engine in struct hal_ops if it is set, which it never
is.
