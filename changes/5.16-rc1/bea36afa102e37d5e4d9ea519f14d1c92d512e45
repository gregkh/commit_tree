ALSA: firewire-motu: add message parser to gather meter information in register DSP model

Some of MOTU models allows software to configure their DSP parameters by
accessing to their registers. The models multiplex messages for status of
DSP into isochronous packet as well as PCM frames. The message includes
information of hardware metering, MIDI message, current parameters of DSP.
For my convenience, I call them as 'register DSP' model.

This patch adds message parser for them to gather hardware meter
information.
