of: net: add a helper for loading netdev->dev_addr

Commit 406f42fa0d3c ("net-next: When a bond have a massive amount
of VLANs...") introduced a rbtree for faster Ethernet address look
up. To maintain netdev->dev_addr in this tree we need to make all
the writes to it got through appropriate helpers.

There are roughly 40 places where netdev->dev_addr is passed
as the destination to a of_get_mac_address() call. Add a helper
which takes a dev pointer instead, so it can call an appropriate
helper.

Note that of_get_mac_address() already assumes the address is
6 bytes long (ETH_ALEN) so use eth_hw_addr_set().
