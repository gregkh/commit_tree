dm: don't stop request queue after the dm device is suspended

For fixing queue quiesce race between driver and block layer(elevator
switch, update nr_requests, ...), we need to support concurrent quiesce
and unquiesce, which requires the two call to be balanced.

__bind() is only called from dm_swap_table() in which dm device has been
suspended already, so not necessary to stop queue again. With this way,
request queue quiesce and unquiesce can be balanced.
