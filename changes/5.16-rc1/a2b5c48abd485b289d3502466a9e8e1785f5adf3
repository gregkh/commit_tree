ASoC: dt-bindings: mediatek: rename reset controller headers in DT example

Commit f07c776f6d7e ("arm64: dts: mediatek: Move reset controller
constants into common location") moves the reset controller headers.
However, it forgot to rename the DT example in mt8192-afe-pcm.yaml.

Renames the DT example to pass dt_binding_check.
