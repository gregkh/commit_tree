clk: at91: clk-sam9x60-pll: add notifier for div part of PLL

SAM9X60's PLL which is also part of SAMA7G5 is composed of 2 parts:
one fractional part and one divider. On SAMA7G5 the CPU PLL could be
changed at run-time to implement DVFS. The hardware clock tree on
SAMA7G5 for CPU PLL is as follows:

                       +---- div1 ----------------> cpuck
                       |
FRAC PLL ---> DIV PLL -+-> prescaler ---> div0 ---> mck0

The div1 block is not implemented in Linux; on prescaler block it has
been discovered a bug on some scenarios and will be removed from Linux
in next commits. Thus, the final clock tree that will be used in Linux
will be as follows:

                       +-----------> cpuck
                       |
FRAC PLL ---> DIV PLL -+-> div0 ---> mck0

It has been proposed in [1] to not introduce a new CPUFreq driver but
to overload the proper clock drivers with proper operation such that
cpufreq-dt to be used. To accomplish this DIV PLL and div0 implement
clock notifiers which applies safe dividers before FRAC PLL is changed.
The current commit treats only the DIV PLL by adding a notifier that
sets a safe divider on PRE_RATE_CHANGE events. The safe divider is
provided by initialization clock code (sama7g5.c). The div0 is treated
in next commits (to keep the changes as clean as possible).
