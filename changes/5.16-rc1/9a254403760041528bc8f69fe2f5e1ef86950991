ovl: fix use after free in struct ovl_aio_req

Example for triggering use after free in a overlay on ext4 setup:

aio_read
  ovl_read_iter
    vfs_iter_read
      ext4_file_read_iter
        ext4_dio_read_iter
          iomap_dio_rw -> -EIOCBQUEUED
          /*
	   * Here IO is completed in a separate thread,
	   * ovl_aio_cleanup_handler() frees aio_req which has iocb embedded
	   */
          file_accessed(iocb->ki_filp); /**BOOM**/

Fix by introducing a refcount in ovl_aio_req similarly to aio_kiocb.  This
guarantees that iocb is only freed after vfs_read/write_iter() returns on
underlying fs.
