mptcp: use batch snmp operations in mptcp_seq_show()

Using snmp_get_cpu_field_batch() allows for better cpu cache
utilization, especially on hosts with large number of cpus.

Also remove special handling when mptcp mibs where not yet
allocated.

I chose to use temporary storage on the stack to keep this patch simple.
We might in the future use the storage allocated in netstat_seq_show().

Combined with prior patch (inlining snmp_get_cpu_field)
time to fetch and output mptcp counters on a 256 cpu host [1]
goes from 75 usec to 16 usec.

[1] L1 cache size is 32KB, it is not big enough to hold all dataset.
