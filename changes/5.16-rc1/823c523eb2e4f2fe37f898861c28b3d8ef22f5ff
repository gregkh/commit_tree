bcma: simplify reference to driver name

When bcma_host_pci_probe() is called, the PCI driver core has already
assigned the device's driver in local_pci_probe(). So dev->driver is always
true, and here it points to bcma_pci_bridge_driver, which has .name set to
"bcma-pci-bridge". Simplify accordingly.
