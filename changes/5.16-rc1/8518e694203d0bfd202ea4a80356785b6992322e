sh: pgtable-3level: Fix cast to pointer from integer of different size

If X2TLB=y (CPU_SHX2=y or CPU_SHX3=y, e.g. migor_defconfig), pgd_t.pgd
is "unsigned long long", causing:

    In file included from arch/sh/include/asm/pgtable.h:13,
		     from include/linux/pgtable.h:6,
		     from include/linux/mm.h:33,
		     from arch/sh/kernel/asm-offsets.c:14:
    arch/sh/include/asm/pgtable-3level.h: In function ‘pud_pgtable’:
    arch/sh/include/asm/pgtable-3level.h:37:9: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
       37 |  return (pmd_t *)pud_val(pud);
	  |         ^

Fix this by adding an intermediate cast to "unsigned long", which is
basically what the old code did before.
