ASoC: SOF: ipc: Remove redundant error check from sof_ipc_tx_message_unlocked

If the snd_sof_dsp_send_msg() failed then we have already returned from
sof_ipc_tx_message_unlocked() with the error message.

There is no need to check if ret is really 0 after this and we can return
directly the return value from tx_wait_done()

At the same time make the remaining checks for error (ret) to match.
