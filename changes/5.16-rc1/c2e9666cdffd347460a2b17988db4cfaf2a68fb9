mwifiex: Run SET_BSS_MODE when changing from P2P to STATION vif-type

We currently handle changing from the P2P to the STATION virtual
interface type slightly different than changing from P2P to ADHOC: When
changing to STATION, we don't send the SET_BSS_MODE command. We do send
that command on all other type-changes though, and it probably makes
sense to send the command since after all we just changed our BSS_MODE.
Looking at prior changes to this part of the code, it seems that this is
simply a leftover from old refactorings.

Since sending the SET_BSS_MODE command is the only difference between
mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() and the current code, we can now use
mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() for both switching to ADHOC and
STATION interface type.

This does not fix any particular bug and just "looked right", so there's
a small chance it might be a regression.
