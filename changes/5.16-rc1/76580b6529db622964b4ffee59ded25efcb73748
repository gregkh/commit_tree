mm/swap: Add folio_mark_accessed()

Convert mark_page_accessed() to folio_mark_accessed().  It already
operated on the entire compound page, but now we can avoid calling
compound_head quite so many times.  Shrinks the function from 424 bytes
to 295 bytes (shrinking by 129 bytes).  The compatibility wrapper is 30
bytes, plus the 8 bytes for the exported symbol means the kernel shrinks
by 91 bytes.
