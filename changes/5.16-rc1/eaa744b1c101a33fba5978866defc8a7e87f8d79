arm64: dts: qcom: add 'chassis-type' property

A new 'chassis-type' root node property has recently been approved for
the device-tree specification, in order to provide a simple way for
userspace to detect the device form factor and adjust their behavior
accordingly.

This patch fills in this property for end-user devices (such as laptops,
smartphones and tablets) based on Qualcomm ARM64 processors.
