drm/edid: parse the DisplayID v2.0 VESA vendor block for MSO

The VESA Organization Vendor-Specific Data Block, defined in VESA
DisplayID Standard v2.0, specifies the eDP Multi-SST Operation (MSO)
stream count and segment pixel overlap.

DisplayID v1.3 has Appendix B: DisplayID as an EDID Extension,
describing how DisplayID sections may be embedded in EDID extension
blocks. DisplayID v2.0 does not have such a section, perhaps implying
that DisplayID v2.0 data should not be included in EDID extensions, but
rather in a "pure" DisplayID structure at its own DDC address pair
A4h/A5h, as described in VESA E-DDC Standard v1.3 chapter 3.

However, in practice, displays out in the field have embedded DisplayID
v2.0 data blocks in EDID extensions, including, in particular, some eDP
MSO displays, where a pure DisplayID structure is not available at all.

Parse the MSO data from the DisplayID data block. Do it as part of
drm_add_display_info(), extending it to parse also DisplayID data to
avoid requiring extra calls to update the information.
