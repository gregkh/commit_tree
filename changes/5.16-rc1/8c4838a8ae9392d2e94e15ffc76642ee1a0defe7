dt-bindings: touchscreen: ti,am3359-tsc: New yaml description

This touchscreen controller is already described in a text file:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/touchscreen/ti-tsc-adc.txt

After introducing a proper description of the MFD, this is the second
step. The file cannot be removed yet as it also contains an ADC
description.
