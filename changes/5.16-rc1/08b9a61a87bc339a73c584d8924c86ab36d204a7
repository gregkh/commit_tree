HID: multitouch: disable sticky fingers for UPERFECT Y

When a finger is on the screen, the UPERFECT Y portable touchscreen
monitor reports a contact in the first place. However, after this
initial report, contacts are not reported at the refresh rate of the
screen as required by the Windows 8 specs.

This behaviour triggers the release_timer, removing the fingers even
though they are still present.

To avoid it, add a new class, similar to MT_CLS_WIN_8 but without the
MT_QUIRK_STICKY_FINGERS quirk for this device.
