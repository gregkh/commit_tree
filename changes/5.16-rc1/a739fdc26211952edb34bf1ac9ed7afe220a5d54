ASoC: soc-component: Convert the mark_module to void*

The mark_module of the snd_soc_component is strict snd_pcm_substream type
which prevents it to be used by compressed streams.

Change the type to void* along with the snd_soc_component_module_get()
and snd_soc_component_module_put() to allow the same mark to be used by
compressed when it's module_get_upon_open is set to 1.
