bpftool: Only probe trace_vprintk feature in 'full' mode

Since commit 368cb0e7cdb5e ("bpftool: Make probes which emit dmesg
warnings optional"), some helpers aren't probed by bpftool unless
`full` arg is added to `bpftool feature probe`.

bpf_trace_vprintk can emit dmesg warnings when probed, so include it.
