kprobes: treewide: Use 'kprobe_opcode_t *' for the code address in get_optimized_kprobe()

Since get_optimized_kprobe() is only used inside kprobes,
it doesn't need to use 'unsigned long' type for 'addr' parameter.
Make it use 'kprobe_opcode_t *' for the 'addr' parameter and
subsequent call of arch_within_optimized_kprobe() also should use
'kprobe_opcode_t *'.

Note that MAX_OPTIMIZED_LENGTH and RELATIVEJUMP_SIZE are defined
by byte-size, but the size of 'kprobe_opcode_t' depends on the
architecture. Therefore, we must be careful when calculating
addresses using those macros.
