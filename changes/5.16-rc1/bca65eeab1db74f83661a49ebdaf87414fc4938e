mm/filemap: Convert mapping_get_entry to return a folio

The pagecache only contains folios, so indicate that this is definitely
not a tail page.  Shrinks mapping_get_entry() by 56 bytes, but grows
pagecache_get_page() by 21 bytes as gcc makes slightly different hot/cold
code decisions.  A net reduction of 35 bytes of text.
