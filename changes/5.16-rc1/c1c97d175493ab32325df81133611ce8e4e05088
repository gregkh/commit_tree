x86/copy_mc: Use EX_TYPE_DEFAULT_MCE_SAFE for exception fixups

Nothing in that code uses the trap number which was stored by the exception
fixup which is instantiated via _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT().

Use _ASM_EXTABLE(... EX_TYPE_DEFAULT_MCE_SAFE) instead which just handles
the IP fixup and the type indicates to the #MC handler that the call site
can handle the abort caused by #MC correctly.
