rtw88: 8821c: correct 2.4G tx power for type 2/4 NIC

NIC card saves calibrated TX power index in the efuse(ROM).
Driver loads TX power idex when interface is up.

The problem is type2/4 NICs loads 2.4G TX power index
from wrong position. This patch corrects the offsets.
So, driver loads real 2.4G TX power index for type 2/4 NICs.

2.4G performance increased when using correct TX power index.
