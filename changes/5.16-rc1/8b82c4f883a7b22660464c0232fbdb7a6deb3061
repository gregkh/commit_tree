clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Move MMIO timer programming over to CVAL

Similarily to the sysreg-based timer, move the MMIO over to using
the CVAL registers instead of TVAL. Note that there is no warranty
that the 64bit MMIO access will be atomic, but the timer is always
disabled at the point where we program CVAL.
