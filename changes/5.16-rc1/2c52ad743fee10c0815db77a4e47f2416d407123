Revert "usb: misc: ehset: Workaround for "special" hubs"

This reverts commit ce3e90d5a0cdbcb2ddebbf9e4363e59fa779ad3a.

The commit in question added list of quirky hubs, but the match
implementation clearly hasn't been tested at all.

First, hub_udev->dev.parent does not represent a USB interface so using
to_usb_interface() makes no sense and we'd be passing a random pointer
to usb_match_id().

Second, if hub_udev is a root hub it doesn't even even represent a USB
device.
