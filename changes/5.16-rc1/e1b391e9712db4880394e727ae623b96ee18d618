soc: qcom: smp2p: Add of_node_put() before goto

Fix following coccicheck warning:
./drivers/soc/qcom/smp2p.c:501:1-33: WARNING: Function
for_each_available_child_of_node should have of_node_put() before goto

Early exits from for_each_available_child_of_node should decrement the
node reference counter.
