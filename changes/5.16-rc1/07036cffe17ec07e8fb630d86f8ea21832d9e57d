KVM: arm64: Prevent re-finalisation of pKVM for a given CPU

__pkvm_prot_finalize() completes the deprivilege of the host when pKVM
is in use by installing a stage-2 translation table for the calling CPU.

Issuing the hypercall multiple times for a given CPU makes little sense,
but in such a case just return early with -EPERM rather than go through
the whole page-table dance again.
