mfd: qcom-spmi-pmic: Document ten more PMICs in the binding

Update the binding with eight more SPMI PMIC compatibles found in the
PMIC info list in the Qualcomm socinfo driver and add the two PM660
related PMICs supported by the SPMI PMIC driver but are missing from the
document.

Then remove the duplicate entry for pma8084.
