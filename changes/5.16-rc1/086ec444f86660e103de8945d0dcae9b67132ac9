signal/sparc32: In setup_rt_frame and setup_fram use force_fatal_sig

Modify the 32bit version of setup_rt_frame and setup_frame to act
similar to the 64bit version of setup_rt_frame and fail with a signal
instead of calling do_exit.

Replacing do_exit(SIGILL) with force_fatal_signal(SIGILL) ensures that
the process will be terminated cleanly when the stack frame is
invalid, instead of just killing off a single thread and leaving the
process is a weird state.
