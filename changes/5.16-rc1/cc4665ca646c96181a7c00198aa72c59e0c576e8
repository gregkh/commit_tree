sctp: subtract sctphdr len in sctp_transport_pl_hlen

sctp_transport_pl_hlen() is called to calculate the outer header length
for PL. However, as the Figure in rfc8899#section-4.4:

   Any additional
     headers         .--- MPS -----.
            |        |             |
            v        v             v
     +------------------------------+
     | IP | ** | PL | protocol data |
     +------------------------------+

                <----- PLPMTU ----->
     <---------- PMTU -------------->

Outer header are IP + Any additional headers, which doesn't include
Packetization Layer itself header, namely sctphdr, whereas sctphdr
is counted by __sctp_mtu_payload().

The incorrect calculation caused the link pathmtu to be set larger
than expected by t->pl.pmtu + sctp_transport_pl_hlen(). This patch
is to fix it by subtracting sctphdr len in sctp_transport_pl_hlen().
