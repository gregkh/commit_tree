scsi: smartpqi: Update LUN reset handler

Enhance check for commands queued to the controller.  Add new function
pqi_nonempty_inbound_queue_count() that will wait for all I/O queued for
submission to controller across all queue groups to drain.  Add helper
functions to obtain queue command counts for each queue group.  These
queues should drain quickly as they are already staged to be submitted down
to the controller's IB queue.

Enhance check for outstanding command completion.  Update the count of
outstanding commands while waiting.  This value was not re-obtained and was
potentially causing infinite wait for all completions.
