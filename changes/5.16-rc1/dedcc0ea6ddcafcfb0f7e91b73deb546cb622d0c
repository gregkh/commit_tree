perf intel-pt: Add support for PERF_RECORD_AUX_OUTPUT_HW_ID

Originally, software only supported redirecting at most one PEBS event to
Intel PT (PEBS-via-PT) because it was not able to differentiate one event
from another. To overcome that, add support for the
PERF_RECORD_AUX_OUTPUT_HW_ID side-band event.

Committer notes:

Cast the pointer arg to for_each_set_bit() to (unsigned long *), to fix
the build on 32-bit systems.
