drm/amd/display: Handle I2C-over-AUX write channel status update

[Why]
When writing long AUX commands some sinks will respond will write status
update requiring source to read status.

[How]
When a write request is replied with data (AUX_ACK_M), retry a read of
write status to determine when the write is completed.
