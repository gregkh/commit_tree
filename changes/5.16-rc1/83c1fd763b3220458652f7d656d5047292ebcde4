mm,hugetlb: remove mlock ulimit for SHM_HUGETLB

Commit 21a3c273f88c ("mm, hugetlb: add thread name and pid to
SHM_HUGETLB mlock rlimit warning") marked this as deprecated in 2012,
but it is not deleted yet.

Mike says he still sees that message in log files on occasion, so maybe we
should preserve this warning.

Also remove hugetlbfs related user_shm_unlock in ipc/shm.c and remove the
user_shm_unlock after out.
