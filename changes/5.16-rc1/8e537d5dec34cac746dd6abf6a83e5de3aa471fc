ALSA: PCM: Fix NULL dereference at mmap checks

The recent refactoring of mmap handling caused Oops on some devices
that don't use the standard memory allocations.  This patch addresses
it by allowing snd_dma_buffer_mmap() helper to receive the NULL
pointer dmab argument (and return an error appropriately).
