mm: hwpoison: refactor refcount check handling

Memory failure will report failure if the page still has extra pinned
refcount other than from hwpoison after the handler is done.  Actually
the check is not necessary for all handlers, so move the check into
specific handlers.  This would make the following keeping shmem page in
page cache patch easier.

There may be expected extra pin for some cases, for example, when the
page is dirty and in swapcache.
