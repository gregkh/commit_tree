dt-bindings: thermal: allow more resets for tsadc node in rockchip-thermal.yaml

The tsadc node in rk356x.dtsi has more resets defined then currently
allowed by rockchip-thermal.yaml, so fix that in the documentation.
The driver now uses the devm_reset_control_array_get() function,
so reset-names is no longer required, but keep it for legacy reasons.
