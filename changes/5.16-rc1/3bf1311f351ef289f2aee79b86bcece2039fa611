vfio/ccw: Convert to use vfio_register_emulated_iommu_dev()

This is a more complicated conversion because vfio_ccw is sharing the
vfio_device between both the mdev_device, its vfio_device and the
css_driver.

The mdev is a singleton, and the reason for this sharing is so the extra
css_driver function callbacks to be delivered to the vfio_device
implementation.

This keeps things as they are, with the css_driver allocating the
singleton, not the mdev_driver.

Embed the vfio_device in the vfio_ccw_private and instantiate it as a
vfio_device when the mdev probes. The drvdata of both the css_device and
the mdev_device point at the private, and container_of is used to get it
back from the vfio_device.
