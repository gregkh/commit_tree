usb-storage: Add compatibility quirk flags for iODD 2531/2541

These drive enclosures have firmware bugs that make it impossible to mount
a new virtual ISO image after Linux ejects the old one if the device is
locked by Linux. Windows bypasses this problem by the fact that they do
not lock the device. Add a quirk to disable device locking for these
drive enclosures.
