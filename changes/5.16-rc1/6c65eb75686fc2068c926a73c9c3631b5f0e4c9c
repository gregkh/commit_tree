kcsan: Start stack trace with explicit location if provided

If an explicit access address is set, as is done for scoped accesses,
always start the stack trace from that location. get_stack_skipnr() is
changed into sanitize_stack_entries(), which if given an address, scans
the stack trace for a matching function and then replaces that entry
with the explicitly provided address.

The previous reports for scoped accesses were all over the place, which
could be quite confusing. We now always point at the start of the scope.
