Input: axp20x-pek - Use new soc_intel_is_cht() helper

Use the new soc_intel_is_cht() helper to find out if we are running
on a CHT device rather then checking the ACPI _HRV field.

This is more reliable (some CHT devices have been found where the _HRV
for the PMIC is 2 rather then 3) and leads to a nice cleanup.
