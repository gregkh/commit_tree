irq: mips: simplify bcm6345_l1_irq_handle()

As bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() only needs to know /whether/ an IRQ was
resolved, and doesn't need to know the specific IRQ, it's simpler for it
to call generic_handle_domain_irq() directly and check the return code,
so let's do that.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
