mfd: ti_am335x_tscadc: Add TSC prefix in certain macros

While the register list (and names) between ADC0 and ADC1 are pretty
close, the bits inside changed a little bit. To avoid any future
confusion, let's add the TSC prefix when some bits are in a register
that is common to both revisions of the ADC, but are specific to the
am33xx hardware.
