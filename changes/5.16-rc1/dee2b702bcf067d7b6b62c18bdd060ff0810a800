kconfig: Add support for -Wimplicit-fallthrough

Add Kconfig support for -Wimplicit-fallthrough for both GCC and Clang.

The compiler option is under configuration CC_IMPLICIT_FALLTHROUGH,
which is enabled by default.

Special thanks to Nathan Chancellor who fixed the Clang bug[1][2]. This
bugfix only appears in Clang 14.0.0, so older versions still contain
the bug and -Wimplicit-fallthrough won't be enabled for them, for now.

This concludes a long journey and now we are finally getting rid
of the unintentional fallthrough bug-class in the kernel, entirely. :)
