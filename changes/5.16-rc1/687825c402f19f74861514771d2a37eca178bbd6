dt-bindings: msm/dp: Change reg definition

reg was defined as one region covering the entire DP block, but the
memory map is actually split in 4 regions and obviously the size of
these regions differs between platforms.

Switch the reg to require that all four regions are specified instead.
It is expected that the implementation will handle existing DTBs, even
though the schema defines the new layout.
