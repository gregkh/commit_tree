coresight: etm4x: Use Trace Filtering controls dynamically

The Trace Filtering support (FEAT_TRF) ensures that the ETM
can be prohibited from generating any trace for a given EL.
This is much stricter knob, than the TRCVICTLR exception level
masks, which doesn't prevent the ETM from generating Context
packets for an "excluded" EL. At the moment, we do a onetime
enable trace at user and kernel and leave it untouched for the
kernel life time. This implies that the ETM could potentially
generate trace packets containing the kernel addresses, and
thus leaking the kernel virtual address in the trace.

This patch makes the switch dynamic, by honoring the filters
set by the user and enforcing them in the TRFCR controls.
We also rename the cpu_enable_tracing() appropriately to
cpu_detect_trace_filtering() and the drvdata member
trfc => trfcr to indicate the "value" of the TRFCR_EL1.
