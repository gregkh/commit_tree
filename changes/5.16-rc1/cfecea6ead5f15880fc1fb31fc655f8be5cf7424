lib/string: Move helper functions out of string.c

The core functions of string.c are those that may be implemented by
per-architecture functions, or overloaded by FORTIFY_SOURCE. As a
result, it needs to be built with __NO_FORTIFY. Without this, macros
will collide with function declarations. This was accidentally working
due to -ffreestanding (on some architectures). Make this deterministic
by explicitly setting __NO_FORTIFY and move all the helper functions
into string_helpers.c so that they gain the fortification coverage they
had been missing.
