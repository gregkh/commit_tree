drm/i915/guc: Workaround reset G2H is received after schedule done G2H

If the context is reset as a result of the request cancellation the
context reset G2H is received after schedule disable done G2H which is
the wrong order. The schedule disable done G2H release the waiting
request cancellation code which resubmits the context. This races
with the context reset G2H which also wants to resubmit the context but
in this case it really should be a NOP as request cancellation code owns
the resubmit. Use some clever tricks of checking the context state to
seal this race until the GuC firmware is fixed.
