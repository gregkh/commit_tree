KVM: x86: Subsume nested GPA read helper into load_pdptrs()

Open code the call to mmu->translate_gpa() when loading nested PDPTRs and
kill off the existing helper, kvm_read_guest_page_mmu(), to discourage
incorrect use.  Reading guest memory straight from an L2 GPA is extremely
rare (as evidenced by the lack of users), as very few constructs in x86
specify physical addresses, even fewer are virtualized by KVM, and even
fewer yet require emulation of L2 by L0 KVM.

No functional change intended.
