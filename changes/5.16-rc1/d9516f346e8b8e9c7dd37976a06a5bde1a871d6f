audit: return early if the filter rule has a lower priority

It is not necessary for audit_filter_rules() functions to check
audit fileds of the rule with a lower priority, and if we did,
there might be some unintended effects, such as the ctx->ppid
may be changed unexpectedly, so return early if the rule has
a lower priority.
