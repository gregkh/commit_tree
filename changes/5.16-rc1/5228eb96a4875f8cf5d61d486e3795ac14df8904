KVM: x86: nSVM: implement nested TSC scaling

This was tested by booting a nested guest with TSC=1Ghz,
observing the clocks, and doing about 100 cycles of migration.

Note that qemu patch is needed to support migration because
of a new MSR that needs to be placed in the migration state.

The patch will be sent to the qemu mailing list soon.
