RISC-V: KVM: Implement VCPU interrupts and requests handling

This patch implements VCPU interrupts and requests which are both
asynchronous events.

The VCPU interrupts can be set/unset using KVM_INTERRUPT ioctl from
user-space. In future, the in-kernel IRQCHIP emulation will use
kvm_riscv_vcpu_set_interrupt() and kvm_riscv_vcpu_unset_interrupt()
functions to set/unset VCPU interrupts.

Important VCPU requests implemented by this patch are:
KVM_REQ_SLEEP       - set whenever VCPU itself goes to sleep state
KVM_REQ_VCPU_RESET  - set whenever VCPU reset is requested

The WFI trap-n-emulate (added later) will use KVM_REQ_SLEEP request
and kvm_riscv_vcpu_has_interrupt() function.

The KVM_REQ_VCPU_RESET request will be used by SBI emulation (added
later) to power-up a VCPU in power-off state. The user-space can use
the GET_MPSTATE/SET_MPSTATE ioctls to get/set power state of a VCPU.
