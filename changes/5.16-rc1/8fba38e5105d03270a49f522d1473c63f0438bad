staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of usb_write8()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_write8() and usb_write8() and embed their
code into the caller (i.e., rtw_write8()).

_rtw_write8() is a mere redefinition of rtw_write8() and it is unneeded.
usb_write8() was the only functions assigned to the (*_usb_write8) pointer,
so we can simply remove it and make a direct call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
