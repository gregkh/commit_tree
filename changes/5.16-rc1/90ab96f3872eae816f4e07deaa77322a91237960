drm/i915/fb: Fix rounding error in subsampled plane size calculation

For NV12 FBs with odd main surface tile-row height the CCS surface
height was incorrectly calculated 1 less than the actual value. Fix this
by rounding up the result of divison. For consistency do the same for
the CCS surface width calculation.
