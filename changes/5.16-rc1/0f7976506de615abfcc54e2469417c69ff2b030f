drm/i915/guc: Rework and simplify locking

Rework and simplify the locking with GuC subission. Drop
sched_state_no_lock and move all fields under the guc_state.sched_state
and protect all these fields with guc_state.lock . This requires
changing the locking hierarchy from guc_state.lock -> sched_engine.lock
to sched_engine.lock -> guc_state.lock.

v2:
 (Daniele)
  - Don't check fields outside of lock during sched disable, check less
    fields within lock as some of the outside are no longer needed
