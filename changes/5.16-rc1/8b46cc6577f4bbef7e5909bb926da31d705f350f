drm/i915: Tweaked Wa_14010685332 for all PCHs

dispcnlunit1_cp_xosc_clkreq clock observed to be active on TGL-H platform
despite Wa_14010685332 original sequence,
thus blocks entry to deeper s0ix state.

The Tweaked Wa_14010685332 sequence fixes this issue, therefore use tweaked
Wa_14010685332 sequence for every PCH since PCH_CNP.

v2:
- removed RKL from comment and simplified condition. [Rodrigo]
