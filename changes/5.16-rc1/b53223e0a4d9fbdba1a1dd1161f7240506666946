arm64/sve: Remove sve_load_from_fpsimd_state()

Following optimisations of the SVE register handling we no longer load the
SVE state from a saved copy of the FPSIMD registers, we convert directly
in registers or from one saved state to another. Remove the function so we
don't need to update it during further refactoring.
