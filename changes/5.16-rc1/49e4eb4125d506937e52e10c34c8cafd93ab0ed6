x86/fpu/xstate: Use fpstate for copy_uabi_to_xstate()

Prepare for dynamically enabled states per task. The function needs to
retrieve the features and sizes which are valid in a fpstate
context. Retrieve them from fpstate.

Move the function declarations to the core header as they are not
required anywhere else.
