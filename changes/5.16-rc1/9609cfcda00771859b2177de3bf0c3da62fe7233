ASoC: soc-pcm: restore mixer functionality

Recent changes in soc-pcm completely broke basic support for mixers on
Intel systems: the filters on BE states prevent the connection of a
second mixer input while the back-end is already active.

Rather than reverting the changes, which would be problematic for
Tegra systems, this patch suggests an additional filter which will
only apply to Tegra systems. This is a temporary solution which will
have to be revisited - additional issues have been reported with DPCM.
