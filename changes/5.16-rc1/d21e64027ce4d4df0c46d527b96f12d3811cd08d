irq: simplify handle_domain_{irq,nmi}()

There's no need for handle_domain_{irq,nmi}() to open-code the NULL
check performed by handle_irq_desc(), nor the resolution of the desc
performed by generic_handle_domain_irq().

Use generic_handle_domain_irq() directly, as this is functioanlly
equivalent and clearer. At the same time, delete the stale comments,
which are no longer helpful.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
