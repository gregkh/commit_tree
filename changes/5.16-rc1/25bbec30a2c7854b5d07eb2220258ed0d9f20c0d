mwifiex: Allow switching interface type from P2P_CLIENT to P2P_GO

It's possible to change virtual interface type between P2P_CLIENT and
P2P_GO, the card supports that just fine, and it happens for example
when using miracast with the miraclecast software.

So allow type changes between P2P_CLIENT and P2P_GO and simply call into
mwifiex_change_vif_to_p2p(), which handles this just fine. We have to
call mwifiex_cfg80211_deinit_p2p() before though to make sure the old
p2p mode is properly uninitialized.
