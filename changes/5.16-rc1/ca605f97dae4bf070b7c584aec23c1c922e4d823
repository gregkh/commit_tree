crypto: qat - power up 4xxx device

After reset or boot, QAT 4xxx devices are inactive and require to be
explicitly activated.
This is done by writing the DRV_ACTIVE bit in the PM_INTERRUPT register
and polling the PM_INIT_STATE to make sure that the transaction has
completed properly.

If this is not done, the driver will fail the initialization sequence
reporting the following message:
    [   22.081193] 4xxx 0000:f7:00.0: enabling device (0140 -> 0142)
    [   22.720285] QAT: AE0 is inactive!!
    [   22.720287] QAT: failed to get device out of reset
    [   22.720288] 4xxx 0000:f7:00.0: qat_hal_clr_reset error
    [   22.720290] 4xxx 0000:f7:00.0: Failed to init the AEs
    [   22.720290] 4xxx 0000:f7:00.0: Failed to initialise Acceleration Engine
    [   22.720789] 4xxx 0000:f7:00.0: Resetting device qat_dev0
    [   22.825099] 4xxx: probe of 0000:f7:00.0 failed with error -14

The patch also temporarily disables the power management source of
interrupt, to avoid possible spurious interrupts as the power management
feature is not fully supported.

The device init function has been added to adf_dev_init(), and not in the
probe of 4xxx to make sure that the device is re-enabled in case of
reset.

Note that the error code reported by hw_data->init_device() in
adf_dev_init() has been shadowed for consistency with the other calls
in the same function.
