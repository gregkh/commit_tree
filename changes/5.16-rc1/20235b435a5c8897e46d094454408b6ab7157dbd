fuse: cleanup code conditional on fc->writeback_cache

It's safe to call file_update_time() if writeback cache is not enabled,
since S_NOCMTIME is set in this case.  This part is purely a cleanup.

__fuse_copy_file_range() also calls fuse_write_update_attr() only in the
writeback cache case.  This is inconsistent with other callers, where it's
called unconditionally.
