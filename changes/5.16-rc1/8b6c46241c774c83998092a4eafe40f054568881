bpftool: Remove Makefile dep. on $(LIBBPF) for $(LIBBPF_INTERNAL_HDRS)

The dependency is only useful to make sure that the $(LIBBPF_HDRS_DIR)
directory is created before we try to install locally the required
libbpf internal header. Let's create this directory properly instead.

This is in preparation of making $(LIBBPF_INTERNAL_HDRS) a dependency to
the bootstrap bpftool version, in which case we want no dependency on
$(LIBBPF).
