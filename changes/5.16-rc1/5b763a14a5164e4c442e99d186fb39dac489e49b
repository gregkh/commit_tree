sched/numa: Remove the redundant member numa_group::fault_cpus

numa_group::fault_cpus is actually a pointer to the region
in numa_group::faults[] where NUMA_CPU stats are located.

Remove this redundant member and use numa_group::faults[NUMA_CPU]
directly like it is done for similar per-process numa fault stats.

There is no functionality change due to this commit.
