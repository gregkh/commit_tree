i2c: Allow an ACPI driver to manage the device's power state during probe

Enable drivers to tell ACPI that there's no need to power on a device for
probe. Drivers should still perform this by themselves if there's a need
to. In some cases powering on the device during probe is undesirable, and
this change enables a driver to choose what fits best for it.

Add a field called "flags" into struct i2c_driver for driver flags, and a
flag I2C_DRV_ACPI_WAIVE_D0_PROBE to tell a driver supports probe in ACPI D
states other than 0.
