mm/page_alloc.c: do not acquire zone lock in is_free_buddy_page()

Grabbing zone lock in is_free_buddy_page() gives a wrong sense of
safety, and has potential performance implications when zone is
experiencing lock contention.

In any case, if a caller needs a stable result, it should grab zone lock
before calling this function.
