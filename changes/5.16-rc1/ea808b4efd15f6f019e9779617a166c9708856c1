mm/page_alloc.c: remove meaningless VM_BUG_ON() in pindex_to_order()

Patch series "Cleanups and fixup for page_alloc", v2.

This series contains cleanups to remove meaningless VM_BUG_ON(), use
helpers to simplify the code and remove obsolete comment.  Also we avoid
allocating highmem pages via alloc_pages_exact[_nid].  More details can be
found in the respective changelogs.

This patch (of 5):

It's meaningless to VM_BUG_ON() order != pageblock_order just after
setting order to pageblock_order.  Remove it.
