cifs: nosharesock should not share socket with future sessions

Today, when a new mount is done with nosharesock, we ensure
that we don't select an existing matching session. However,
we don't mark the connection as nosharesock, which means that
those could be shared with future sessions.

Fixed it with this commit. Also printing this info in DebugData.
