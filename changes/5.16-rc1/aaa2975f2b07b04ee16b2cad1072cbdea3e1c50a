lib/xz: Add MicroLZMA decoder

MicroLZMA is a yet another header format variant where the first
byte of a raw LZMA stream (without the end of stream marker) has
been replaced with a bitwise-negation of the lc/lp/pb properties
byte. MicroLZMA was created to be used in EROFS but can be used
by other things too where wasting minimal amount of space for
headers is important.

This is implemented using most of the LZMA2 code as is so the
amount of new code is small. The API has a few extra features
compared to the XZ decoder. On the other hand, the API lacks
XZ_BUF_ERROR support which is important to take into account
when using this API.

MicroLZMA doesn't support BCJ filters. In theory they could be
added later as there are many unused/reserved values for the
first byte of the compressed stream but in practice it is
somewhat unlikely to happen due to a few implementation reasons.
