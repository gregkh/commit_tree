USB: gadget: udc: Remove some dead code

The 'drd_wq' workqueue_struct has never been used.
It is only destroyed, but never created.

It was introduced in commit 1b9f35adb0ff ("usb: gadget: udc: Add Synopsys
UDC Platform driver")

Remove the corresponding dead code and save some space from the 'udc'
structure.
