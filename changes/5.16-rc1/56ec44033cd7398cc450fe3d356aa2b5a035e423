ptp: ocp: Skip resources with out of range irqs

The TimeCard exposes different resources, which may have their
own irqs.  Space for the irqs is allocated through a MSI or MSI-X
interrupt vector.  On some platforms, the interrupt allocation
fails.

Rather than making this fatal, just skip exposing those resources.

The main timecard functionality (that of a PTP clock) will work
without the additional resources.
