arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-sk: Add DDR carveout memory nodes

Two carveout reserved memory nodes each have been added for each of the
other remote processors devices within the MAIN domain on the TI J721E
SK boards. These nodes are assigned to the respective rproc device nodes
as well. The first region will be used as the DMA pool for the rproc
devices, and the second region will furnish the static carveout regions
for the firmware memory.

An additional reserved memory node is also added to reserve a portion of
the DDR memory to be used for performing inter-processor communication
between all the remote processors running RTOS or baremetal firmwares.
8 MB of memory is reserved for this purpose, and this accounts for all
the vrings and vring buffers between all the possible pairs of remote
processors.

The current carveout addresses and sizes are defined statically for each
rproc device. The R5F processors do not have an MMU, and as such require
the exact memory used by the firmwares to be set-aside. The C71x DSP
processor does support a MMU called CMMU, but is not currently supported
and as such requires the exact memory used by the firmware to be
set-aside. The firmware images do not require any RSC_CARVEOUT entries
in their resource tables to allocate the memory for firmware memory
segments
