net/mlx5: Add support to create match definer

Introduce new APIs to create and destroy flow matcher
for given format id.

Flow match definer object is used for defining the fields and
mask used for the hash calculation. User should mask the desired
fields like done in the match criteria.

This object is assigned to flow group of type hash. In this flow
group type, packets lookup is done based on the hash result.

This patch also adds the required bits to create such flow group.
