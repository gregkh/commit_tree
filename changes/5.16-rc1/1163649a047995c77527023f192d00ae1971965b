drm/i915/display/adlp: Optimize PSR2 power-savings in corner cases

The Wa_14014971508 is required to fix scanout when a feature that i915
do not support is enabled and this feature is not planned to be enabled
for adlp.

Keeping this workaround enabled can badly hurt power-savings when
a full frame fetch is required(see psr2_sel_fetch_plane_state_supported()
and psr2_sel_fetch_pipe_state_supported()).

Here a example that could badly hurt power-savings, userspace does
a page flip to a rotated plane, so CONTINUOS_FULL_FRAME set.
But then for a whole 30 seconds nothing in the screen requires updates
but because CONTINUOS_FULL_FRAME is set, it will not go into DC5/DC6.

Reverting Wa_14014971508 fixes that, as only a single frame will be
sent and then display can go to DC5/DC6 for those 30 seconds of
idleness.
