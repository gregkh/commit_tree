x86/hyperv: Add Write/Read MSR registers via ghcb page

Hyperv provides GHCB protocol to write Synthetic Interrupt
Controller MSR registers in Isolation VM with AMD SEV SNP
and these registers are emulated by hypervisor directly.
Hyperv requires to write SINTx MSR registers twice. First
writes MSR via GHCB page to communicate with hypervisor
and then writes wrmsr instruction to talk with paravisor
which runs in VMPL0. Guest OS ID MSR also needs to be set
via GHCB page.
