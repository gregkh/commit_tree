memblock: add MEMBLOCK_DRIVER_MANAGED to mimic IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED

Let's add a flag that corresponds to IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED,
indicating that we're dealing with a memory region that is never
indicated in the firmware-provided memory map, but always detected and
added by a driver.

Similar to MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG, most infrastructure has to treat such
memory regions like ordinary MEMBLOCK_NONE memory regions -- for
example, when selecting memory regions to add to the vmcore for dumping
in the crashkernel via for_each_mem_range().

However, especially kexec_file is not supposed to select such memblocks
via for_each_free_mem_range() / for_each_free_mem_range_reverse() to
place kexec images, similar to how we handle
IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED without CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK.

We'll make sure that memory hotplug code sets the flag where applicable
(IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED) next.  This prepares architectures
that need CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK, such as arm64, for virtio-mem
support.

Note that kexec *must not* indicate this memory to the second kernel and
*must not* place kexec-images on this memory.  Let's add a comment to
kexec_walk_memblock(), documenting how we handle MEMBLOCK_DRIVER_MANAGED
now just like using IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED in
locate_mem_hole_callback() for kexec_walk_resources().

Also note that MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG cannot be reused due to different
semantics:
	MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG: memory is indicated as "System RAM" in the
	firmware-provided memory map and added to the system early during
	boot; kexec *has to* indicate this memory to the second kernel and
	can place kexec-images on this memory. After memory hotunplug,
	kexec has to be re-armed. We mostly ignore this flag when
	"movable_node" is not set on the kernel command line, because
	then we're told to not care about hotunpluggability of such
	memory regions.

	MEMBLOCK_DRIVER_MANAGED: memory is not indicated as "System RAM" in
	the firmware-provided memory map; this memory is always detected
	and added to the system by a driver; memory might not actually be
	physically hotunpluggable. kexec *must not* indicate this memory to
	the second kernel and *must not* place kexec-images on this memory.
