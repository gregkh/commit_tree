mm/writeback: Add folio_account_cleaned()

Get the statistics right; compound pages were being accounted as a
single page.  This didn't matter before now as no filesystem which
supported compound pages did writeback.  Also move the declaration
to pagemap.h since this is part of the page cache.  Add a wrapper for
account_page_cleaned().
