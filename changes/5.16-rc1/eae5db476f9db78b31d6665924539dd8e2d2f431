xfs: dynamically allocate btree scrub context structure

Reorganize struct xchk_btree so that we can dynamically size the context
structure to fit the type of btree cursor that we have.  This will
enable us to use memory more efficiently once we start adding very tall
btree types.  Right-size the lastkey array to match the number of *node*
levels in the tree so that we stop wasting space.
