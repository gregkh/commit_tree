drm/i915/gem: Implement a function to process all gem objects of a region

An upcoming common pattern is to traverse the region object list and
perform certain actions on all objects in a region. It's a little tricky
to get the list locking right, in particular since a gem object may
change region unless it's pinned or the object lock is held.

Define a function that does this for us and that takes an argument that
defines the action to be performed on each object.
