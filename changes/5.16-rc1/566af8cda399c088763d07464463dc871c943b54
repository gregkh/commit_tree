powerpc/audit: Convert powerpc to AUDIT_ARCH_COMPAT_GENERIC

Commit e65e1fc2d24b ("[PATCH] syscall class hookup for all normal
targets") added generic support for AUDIT but that didn't include
support for bi-arch like powerpc.

Commit 4b58841149dc ("audit: Add generic compat syscall support")
added generic support for bi-arch.

Convert powerpc to that bi-arch generic audit support.
