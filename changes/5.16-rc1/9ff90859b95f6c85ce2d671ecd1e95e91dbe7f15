ASoC: SOF: Print the dbg_dump and ipc_dump once to reduce kernel log noise

Do not print the dump more than once to keep the kernel log cleaner in case
of a firmware failure.

When the DSP is rebooted due to suspend or runtime_suspend reset the flags
to re-enable the dump prints.

Add also a debug flag to print all dumps to get more coverage if needed.
