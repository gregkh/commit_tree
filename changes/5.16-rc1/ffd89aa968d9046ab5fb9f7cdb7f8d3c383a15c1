drm/amd/display: Add support for USB4 on C20 PHY for DCN3.1

[Why]
Created new fields that matches new B0 structs On DCN31 the mapping of
DIO output to PHY differs from A0 to B0 boards with new PHY C20 & this
new mapping needed to be handled.

[How]
Mapped new structure based on new structs Added logic for mapping over
A0 and B0 boards Hooked all new structs together.
