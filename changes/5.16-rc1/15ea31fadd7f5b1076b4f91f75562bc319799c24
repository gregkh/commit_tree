libbpf: Refactor ELF section handler definitions

Refactor ELF section handler definitions table to use a set of flags and
unified SEC_DEF() macro. This allows for more succinct and table-like
set of definitions, and allows to more easily extend the logic without
adding more verbosity (this is utilized in later patches in the series).

This approach is also making libbpf-internal program pre-load callback
not rely on bpf_sec_def definition, which demonstrates that future
pluggable ELF section handlers will be able to achieve similar level of
integration without libbpf having to expose extra types and APIs.

For starters, update SEC_DEF() definitions and make them more succinct.
Also convert BPF_PROG_SEC() and BPF_APROG_COMPAT() definitions to
a common SEC_DEF() use.
