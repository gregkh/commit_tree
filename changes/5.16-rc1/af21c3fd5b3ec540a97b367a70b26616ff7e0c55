scsi: ufs: core: Retry START_STOP on UNIT_ATTENTION

Commit 57d104c153d3 ("ufs: add UFS power management support") made the UFS
driver submit a REQUEST SENSE command before submitting a power management
command to a WLUN to clear the POWER ON unit attention. Instead of
submitting a REQUEST SENSE command before submitting a power management
command, retry the power management command until it succeeds.

This is the preparation to get rid of all UNIT ATTENTION code which should
be handled by users.
