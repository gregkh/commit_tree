arm64: dts: rockchip: Re-add interrupt-names for RK3399's vpu

Commit 53a05c8f6e8e ("arm64: dts: rockchip: remove interrupt-names from iommu nodes")
intended to remove the interrupt-names property for mmu nodes, but it
also removed it for the vpu node in rk3399.dtsi. That makes the driver
fail probing currently.
Fix this by re-adding the property for this node.
