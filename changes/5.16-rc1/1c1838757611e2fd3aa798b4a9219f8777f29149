ARM: 9123/1: scoop: Drop if with an always false condition

The remove callback is only called after probe completed successfully.
In this case platform_set_drvdata() was called with a non-NULL argument
and so !sdev is never true.

The motivation for this change is to get rid of non-zero return values
for remove callbacks as their only effect is to trigger a runtime
warning. See commit e5e1c2097881 ("driver core: platform: Emit a warning
if a remove callback returned non-zero") for further details.
