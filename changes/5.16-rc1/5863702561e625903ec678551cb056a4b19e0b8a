perf/x86/vlbr: Add c->flags to vlbr event constraints

Just like what we do in the x86_get_event_constraints(), the
PERF_X86_EVENT_LBR_SELECT flag should also be propagated
to event->hw.flags so that the host lbr driver can save/restore
MSR_LBR_SELECT for the special vlbr event created by KVM or BPF.

Fixes: 097e4311cda9 ("perf/x86: Add constraint to create guest LBR event without hw counter")
