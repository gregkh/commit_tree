platform/x86: wmi: simplify error handling logic

The current code carries out the following ACPI status
mapping:

  AE_NOT_FOUND -> AE_OK
  AE_OK        -> AE_OK
  AE_$X        -> AE_$X

That is, everything is mapped to itself, except AE_NOT_FOUND.
The current code does not do it in the most straighforward way.
Simplify the logic.
