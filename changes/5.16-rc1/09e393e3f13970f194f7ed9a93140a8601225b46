spi: cadence-quadspi: Add OSPI support for Xilinx Versal SoC

Add OSPI support for Xilinx Versal SoCs.
Disable the Direct Access Controller for Xilinx Versal OSPI.
On Xilinx Versal platform, AXI interface need to be selected as Linear
mode (driven from interconnect rather than external DMA) to use
Software triggered 'indirect' mode of operation. This will be achieved
by calling Xilinx firmware API.
