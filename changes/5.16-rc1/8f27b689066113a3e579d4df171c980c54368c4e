ALSA: usb-audio: Line6 HX-Stomp XL USB_ID for 48k-fixed quirk

Adding the Line6 HX-Stomp XL USB_ID as it needs this fixed frequency
quirk as well.

The device is basically just the HX-Stomp with some more buttons on
the face.  I've done some recording with it after adding it, and it
seems to function properly with this fix.  The Midi features appear to
be working as well.
