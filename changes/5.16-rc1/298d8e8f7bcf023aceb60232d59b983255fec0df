media: rkvdec: Do not override sizeimage for output format

The rkvdec H.264 decoder currently overrides sizeimage for the output
format. This causes issues when userspace requires and requests a larger
buffer, but ends up with one of insufficient size.

Instead, only provide a default size if none was requested. This fixes
the video_decode_accelerator_tests from Chromium failing on the first
frame due to insufficient buffer space. It also aligns the behavior
of the rkvdec driver with the Hantro and Cedrus drivers.
