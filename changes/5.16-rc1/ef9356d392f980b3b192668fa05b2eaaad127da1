bpftool: Improve skeleton generation for data maps without DATASEC type

It can happen that some data sections (e.g., .rodata.cst16, containing
compiler populated string constants) won't have a corresponding BTF
DATASEC type. Now that libbpf supports .rodata.* and .data.* sections,
situation like that will cause invalid BPF skeleton to be generated that
won't compile successfully, as some parts of skeleton would assume
memory-mapped struct definitions for each special data section.

Fix this by generating empty struct definitions for such data sections.
