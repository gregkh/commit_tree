mm: Add folio_put()

If we know we have a folio, we can call folio_put() instead of put_page()
and save the overhead of calling compound_head().  Also skips the
devmap checks.

This commit looks like it should be a no-op, but actually saves 684 bytes
of text with the distro-derived config that I'm testing.  Some functions
grow a little while others shrink.  I presume the compiler is making
different inlining decisions.
