iwlwifi: BZ Family SW reset support

Previously added BZ reset wasn't taking into account the
call to iwl_trans_pcie_sw_reset which used a pre-BZ logic
to reset the device - enabling iwl_trans_pcie_sw_reset to
support BZ family made this reset redundant.

MAC_ACCESS clear shouldn't be called here but only when calling
_iwl_trans_pcie_stop_device which now support also BZ family.
