fanotify: Fold event size calculation to its own function

Every time this function is invoked, it is immediately added to
FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN, since there is no need to just calculate the
length of info records. This minor clean up folds the rest of the
calculation into the function, which now operates in terms of events,
returning the size of the entire event, including metadata.
