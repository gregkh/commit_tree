btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()

Since setup_items_for_insert() is not used anymore outside of ctree.c,
make it static and remove its prototype from ctree.h. This also requires
to move the definition of setup_item_for_insert() from ctree.h to ctree.c
and move down btrfs_duplicate_item() so that it's defined after
setup_items_for_insert().

Further, since setup_item_for_insert() is used outside ctree.c, rename it
to btrfs_setup_item_for_insert().

This patch is part of a small patchset that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: loop only once over data sizes array when inserting an item batch
  btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()
  btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging directories

This is patch 2/3 and performance results, and the specific tests, are
included in the changelog of patch 3/3.
