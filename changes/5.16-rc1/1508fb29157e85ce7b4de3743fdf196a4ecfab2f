hwmon: (nct6775) add Pro WS X570-ACE

ASUS Pro WS X570-ACE board has got an nct6775 chip, but by default
there's no use of it because of resource conflict:

```
ACPI Warning: SystemIO range 0x0000000000000295-0x0000000000000296 conflicts with OpRegion 0x0000000000000290-0x0000000000000299 (\AMW0.SHWM) (20210604/utaddress-204
)
ACPI: OSL: Resource conflict; ACPI support missing from driver?
ACPI: OSL: Resource conflict: System may be unstable or behave erratically
```

A workaround is to use `acpi_enforce_resources=lax`, but a proper
support needs to be added instead.

This commit adds Pro WS X570-ACE to the list of boards that can be monitored
using ASUS WMI.

Tested by me on this hardware:
