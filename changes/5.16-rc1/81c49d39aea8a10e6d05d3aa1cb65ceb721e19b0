cgroup: Fix rootcg cpu.stat guest double counting

In account_guest_time in kernel/sched/cputime.c guest time is
attributed to both CPUTIME_NICE and CPUTIME_USER in addition to
CPUTIME_GUEST_NICE and CPUTIME_GUEST respectively. Therefore, adding
both to calculate usage results in double counting any guest time at
the rootcg.
