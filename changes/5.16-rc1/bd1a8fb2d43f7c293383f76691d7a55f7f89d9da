mm/vmalloc: don't allow VM_NO_GUARD on vmap()

The vmalloc guard pages are added on top of each allocation, thereby
isolating any two allocations from one another.  The top guard of the
lower allocation is the bottom guard guard of the higher allocation etc.

Therefore VM_NO_GUARD is dangerous; it breaks the basic premise of
isolating separate allocations.

There are only two in-tree users of this flag, neither of which use it
through the exported interface.  Ensure it stays this way.
