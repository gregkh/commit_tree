tty: Fix extra "not" in TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW description

TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW flag (which is always set for e.g. serial ports)
documentation says that driver must always set special character
handling flags in certain conditions.

However, as the following sentence makes clear, what is actually
intended is the opposite.

Fix that by removing the unintended double negation.
