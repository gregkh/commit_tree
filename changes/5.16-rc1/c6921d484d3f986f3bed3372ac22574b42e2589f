drm/i915: Prepare link training for per-lane drive settings

Adjust the link training code to accommodate per-lane drive settings,
if supported by the platform. Actually enabling this will involve
some changes to each platform's .set_signal_level() implementation,
so for the moment all supported platforms will keep using the current
codepath that just uses the same drive settings for all the lanes.

v2: Fix min() vs. max() fumble
v3: Compact the debug print to a single line
