scsi: pm80xx: Fix incorrect port value when registering a device

During phyup event, the firmware provides the phy_id and port_id and driver
is supposed to use these during device handle registration. Previously the
driver was using the port id value from libsas during device handle
registration. Since id can be different from the one assigned by firmware,
this can lead to wrong device registration and drives not showing up.

Use firmware assigned port id during device registration.
