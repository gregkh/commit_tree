PCI/MSI: Deal with devices lying about their MSI mask capability

It appears that some devices are lying about their mask capability,
pretending that they don't have it, while they actually do.
The net result is that now that we don't enable MSIs on such
endpoint.

Add a new per-device flag to deal with this. Further patches will
make use of it, sadly.
