blk-mq: don't grab ->q_usage_counter in blk_mq_sched_bio_merge

blk_mq_sched_bio_merge is only called from blk-mq.c:blk_attempt_bio_merge(),
which is called when queue usage counter is grabbed already:

1) blk_mq_get_new_requests()

2) blk_mq_get_request()
- cached request in current plug owns one queue usage counter

So don't grab ->q_usage_counter in blk_mq_sched_bio_merge(), and more
importantly this nest way causes hang in blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait().
