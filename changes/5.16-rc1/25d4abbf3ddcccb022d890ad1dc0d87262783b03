iio: ltc2983: fail probe if no channels are given

If there are no channels defined in the devicetree, there's no point in
probing the device. We were actually requesting a zero sized 'kmalloc'
array but since we were not touching the ZERO_SIZE_PTR afterwards,
nothing bad was actually happening. Hence this is not really a fix but
rather an improvement.
