irqchip: Fix compile-testing without CONFIG_OF

Drivers using the new IRQCHIP_PLATFORM_DRIVER_BEGIN helper
fail to link when compile-testing without CONFIG_OF,
as that means CONFIG_IRQCHIP is disabled as well:

ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: platform_irqchip_probe
>>> referenced by irq-meson-gpio.c
>>>               irqchip/irq-meson-gpio.o:(meson_gpio_intc_driver) in archive drivers/built-in.a
>>> referenced by irq-mchp-eic.c
>>>               irqchip/irq-mchp-eic.o:(mchp_eic_driver) in archive drivers/built-in.a

As the drivers are not actually used in this case, just
making the reference to this symbol conditional helps
avoid the link failure.
