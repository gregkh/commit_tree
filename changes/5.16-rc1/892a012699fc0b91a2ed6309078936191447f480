ACPI: resources: Add DMI-based legacy IRQ override quirk

After the commit 0ec4e55e9f57 ("ACPI: resources: Add checks for ACPI
IRQ override") is reverted, the keyboard on Medion laptops can't
work again.

To fix the keyboard issue, add a DMI-based override check that will
not affect other machines along the lines of prt_quirks[] in
drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c.

If similar issues are seen on other platforms, the quirk table could
be expanded in the future.
