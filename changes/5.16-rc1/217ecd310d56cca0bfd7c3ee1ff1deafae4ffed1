drm/i915/guc: Verify result from CTB (de)register action

In commit b839a869dfc9 ("drm/i915/guc: Add support for data
reporting in GuC responses") we missed the hypothetical case
that GuC might return positive non-zero value as success data.

While that would be lucky treated as error case, and at the
end will result in reporting valid -EIO, in the meantime this
value will be passed to ERR_PTR that could be misleading.

v2: rebased
