irqchip/csky-mpintc: Fixup mask/unmask implementation

The mask/unmask must be implemented, and enable/disable supplement
them if the HW requires something different at startup time. When
irq source is disabled by mask, mpintc could complete irq normally.

So drop enable/disable if favour of mask/unmask.
