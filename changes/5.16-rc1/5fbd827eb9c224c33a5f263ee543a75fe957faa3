platform/x86: dell-wmi: Recognise or support new switches

Adds support for:

- Dell Inspiron 2in1 tablet mode switch notifications. These are
  delivered by a type 0x0011 message with code 0xe070, followed by a
  flag (1 for laptop mode, 0 for tablet mode).

- Recognising (but not otherwise processing) the Dell Ultra Performance
  mode request switch. This is delivered by a type 0x0012 message with
  code 0x000d, followed by a parameter that is either 1 or 2. It is
  not clear what (if anything) should be done with this notification, so
  it is ignored.
