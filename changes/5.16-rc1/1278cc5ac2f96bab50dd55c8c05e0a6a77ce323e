ALSA: hda/realtek: Headset fixup for Clevo NH77HJQ

On Clevo NH77HJ, NH77HP, and their 15" variants, there is a headset
microphone input attached to 0x19 that does not have a jack detect. In
order to get it working, the pin configuration needs to be set
correctly, and a new ALC256_FIXUP_SYSTEM76_MIC_NO_PRESENCE fixup is
applied. This is similar to the existing System76 quirk for ALC293, but
for ALC256.
