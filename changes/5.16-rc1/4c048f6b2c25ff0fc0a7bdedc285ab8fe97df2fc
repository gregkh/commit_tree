HID: nintendo: improve rumble performance and stability

This patch alters the method that the rumble data is sent to the
controller. Rather than using the enable rumble subcommand for this
purpose, the driver now employs the RUMBLE_ONLY output report. This has
the advantage of not needing to receive a subcommand reply (to the major
benefit of reducing IMU latency) and also seems to make the rumble
vibrations more continuous. Perhaps most importantly it reduces
disconnects during times of heavy rumble.
