ARM: dts: aspeed: everest: Add IBM Operation Panel I2C device

Set I2C bus 14 to multi-master mode and add the panel device that will
register the I2C controller as a slave device.
In addition, in early Everest systems, the panel device was behind an
I2C switch, which doesn't work for slave mode. Get it working (albeit
unreliably, since a master transaction might switch the switch at any
moment) by defaulting the switch channel to the one with the panel.
