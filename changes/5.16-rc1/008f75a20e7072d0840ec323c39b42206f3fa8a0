block: cleanup the flush plug helpers

Consolidate the various helpers into a single blk_flush_plug helper that
takes a plk_plug and the from_scheduler bool and switch all callsites to
call it directly.  Checks that the plug is non-NULL must be performed by
the caller, something that most already do anyway.
