scsi: ufs: Add quirk to handle broken UIC command

Samsung ExynosAuto v9 SoC has two types of host controller interface to
support the virtualization of UFS Device.  One is the physical host (PH)
that is the same as conventional UFSHCI, and the other is the virtual host
(VH) that supports data transfer function only.

In this configuration the virtual host does not support UIC commands. Add a
quirk to return 0 when the UIC command send function is called.
