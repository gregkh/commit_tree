ksmbd: Fix buffer length check in fsctl_validate_negotiate_info()

The validate_negotiate_info_req struct definition includes an extra
field to access the data coming after the header. This causes the check
in fsctl_validate_negotiate_info() to count the first element of the
array twice. This in turn makes some valid requests fail, depending on
whether they include padding or not.
