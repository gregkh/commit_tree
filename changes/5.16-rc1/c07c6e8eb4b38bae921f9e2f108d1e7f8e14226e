net: dsa: populate supported_interfaces member

Add a new DSA switch operation, phylink_get_interfaces, which should
fill in which PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_* are supported by given port.

Use this before phylink_create() to fill phylinks supported_interfaces
member, allowing phylink to determine which PHY_INTERFACE_MODEs are
supported.
