tracing/histogram: Covert expr to const if both operands are constants

If both operands of a hist trigger expression are constants, convert the
expression to a constant. This optimization avoids having to perform the
same calculation multiple times and also saves on memory since the
merged constants are represented by a single struct hist_field instead
or multiple.
