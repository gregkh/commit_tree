x86/extable: Provide EX_TYPE_DEFAULT_MCE_SAFE and EX_TYPE_FAULT_MCE_SAFE

Provide exception fixup types which can be used to identify fixups which
allow in kernel #MC recovery and make them invoke the existing handlers.

These will be used at places where #MC recovery is handled correctly by the
caller.
