ASoC: dt-bindings: mediatek: mt8192: re-add audio afe document

The document was merged as commit 1afc60e00de3 ("dt-bindings:
mediatek: mt8192: add audio afe document").

However, [1] revealed that the commit 1afc60e00de3 breaks
dt_binding_check due to dt-bindings/clock/mt8192-clk.h doesn't
exist.

As a temporary fix, commit 7d94ca3c8acd ("ASoC: mt8192: revert
add audio afe document") reverted commit 1afc60e00de3.

dt-bindings/clock/mt8192-clk.h is in mainline per commit
f35f1a23e0e1 ("clk: mediatek: Add dt-bindings of MT8192 clocks").
Re-adds the document back.
