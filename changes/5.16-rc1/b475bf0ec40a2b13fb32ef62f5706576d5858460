phy: qcom-snps: Correct the FSEL_MASK

The FSEL_MASK which selects the refclock is defined incorrectly.
It should be [4:6] not [5:7]. Due to this incorrect definition, the BIT(7)
in USB2_PHY_USB_PHY_HS_PHY_CTRL_COMMON0 is reset which keeps PHY analog
blocks ON during suspend.
Fix this issue by correctly defining the FSEL_MASK.
