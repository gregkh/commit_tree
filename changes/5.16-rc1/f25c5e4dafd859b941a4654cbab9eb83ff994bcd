kvm: arm64: vgic: Introduce vgic_check_iorange

Add the new vgic_check_iorange helper that checks that an iorange is
sane: the start address and size have valid alignments, the range is
within the addressable PA range, start+size doesn't overflow, and the
start wasn't already defined.

No functional change.
