selftests: xsk: Eliminate test specific if-statement in test runner

Eliminate a test specific if-statement for the RX_FILL_EMTPY stats
test that is present in the test runner. We can do this as we now have
the use_addr_for_fill option. Just create and empty Rx packet stream
and indicated that the test runner should use the addresses in that to
populate the fill ring. As there are no packets in the stream, the
fill ring will be empty and we will get the error stats that we want
to test.
