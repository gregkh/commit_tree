staging: r8188eu: Remove redundant 'if' statement

Remove the redundant first 'if' statement of two identical ones.

In rtw_cmd_thread() there are two identical 'if' statement, one
immediately after the other. They check whether or not the device is
removed or the driver is stopped and, if true, they break a 'while'
loop.

The only noteworthy context difference is that the second statement is
within a block labelled "_next". The code has a 'goto' to the "_next"
label so that the checking is performed each time the above directive
is encountered. Instead, the first 'if' is before the "_next" label.

One of the two must be removed and that it must be the one before the
label because "bSurpriseRemoved" as well as "bDriverStopped" may be
changed asynchronously by other code of the driver and so they should be
checked at each jump to "_next".

Tested with "ASUSTek Computer, Inc. Realtek 8188EUS [USB-N10 Nano]".
