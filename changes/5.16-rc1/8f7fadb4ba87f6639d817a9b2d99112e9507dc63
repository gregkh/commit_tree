powerpc/machdep: Remove stale functions from ppc_md structure

ppc_md.iommu_save() is not set anymore by any platform after
commit c40785ad305b ("powerpc/dart: Use a cachable DART").
So iommu_save() has become a nop and can be removed.

ppc_md.show_percpuinfo() is not set anymore by any platform after
commit 4350147a816b ("[PATCH] ppc64: SMU based macs cpufreq support").

Last users of ppc_md.rtc_read_val() and ppc_md.rtc_write_val() were
removed by commit 0f03a43b8f0f ("[POWERPC] Remove todc code from
ARCH=powerpc")

Last user of kgdb_map_scc() was removed by commit 17ce452f7ea3 ("kgdb,
powerpc: arch specific powerpc kgdb support").

ppc.machine_kexec_prepare() has not been used since
commit 8ee3e0d69623 ("powerpc: Remove the main legacy iSerie platform
code"). This allows the removal of machine_kexec_prepare() and the
rename of default_machine_kexec_prepare() into machine_kexec_prepare()
