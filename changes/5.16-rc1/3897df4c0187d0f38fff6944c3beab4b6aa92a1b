drm/i915/guc: Introduce context parent-child relationship

Introduce context parent-child relationship. Once this relationship is
created all pinning / unpinning operations are directed to the parent
context. The parent context is responsible for pinning all of its
children and itself.

This is a precursor to the full GuC multi-lrc implementation but aligns
to how GuC mutli-lrc interface is defined - a single H2G is used
register / deregister all of the contexts simultaneously.

Subsequent patches in the series will implement the pinning / unpinning
operations for parent / child contexts.

v2:
 (Daniel Vetter)
  - Add kernel doc, add wrapper to access parent to ensure safety
v3:
 (John Harrison)
  - Fix comment explaing GEM_BUG_ON in to_parent()
  - Make variable names generic (non-GuC specific)
v4:
 (John Harrison)
  - s/its'/its/g
