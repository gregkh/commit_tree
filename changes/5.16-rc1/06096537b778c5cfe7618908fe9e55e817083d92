ASoC: rt5682s: Fix hp pop produced immediately after resuming

When the system plays a sound immediately after resuming from S3,
it could hear a little pop from headphones.
It is due to the HP was unmuted before the completion of
jack re-detection finished in parallel.

This patch adds a lock to make sure the HP unmute after jack detect handler,
and adds a few depop changes.
