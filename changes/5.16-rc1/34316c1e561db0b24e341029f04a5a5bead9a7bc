drm/amd/display: Optimize bandwidth on following fast update

[Why]
The current call to optimize_bandwidth never occurs because flip is
always pending from the FULL and FAST updates.

[How]
Optimize on the following flip when it's a FAST update and we know we
aren't going to be modifying the clocks again.
