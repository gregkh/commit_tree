KVM: arm64: Replace get_raz_id_reg() with get_raz_reg()

Reading a RAZ ID register isn't different from reading any other RAZ
register, so get rid of get_raz_id_reg() and replace it with get_raz_reg(),
which does the same thing, but does it without going through two layers of
indirection.

No functional change.
