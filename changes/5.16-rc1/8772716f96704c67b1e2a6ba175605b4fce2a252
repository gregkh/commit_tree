mm: debug_vm_pgtable: don't use __P000 directly

The __Pxxx/__Sxxx macros are only for protection_map[] init.  All usage
of them in linux should come from protection_map array.

Because a lot of architectures would re-initilize protection_map[]
array, eg: x86-mem_encrypt, m68k-motorola, mips, arm, sparc.

Using __P000 is not rigorous.
