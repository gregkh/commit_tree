KVM: X86: Don't check unsync if the original spte is writible

If the original spte is writable, the target gfn should not be the
gfn of synchronized shadowpage and can continue to be writable.

When !can_unsync, speculative must be false.  So when the check of
"!can_unsync" is removed, we need to move the label of "out" up.
