ice: Fix VF true promiscuous mode

When a VF requests promiscuous mode and it's trusted and true promiscuous
mode is enabled the PF driver attempts to enable unicast and/or
multicast promiscuous mode filters based on the request. This is fine,
but there are a couple issues with the current code.

[1] The define to configure the unicast promiscuous mode mask also
    includes bits to configure the multicast promiscuous mode mask, which
    causes multicast to be set/cleared unintentionally.
[2] All 4 cases for enable/disable unicast/multicast mode are not
    handled in the promiscuous mode message handler, which causes
    unexpected results regarding the current promiscuous mode settings.

To fix [1] make sure any promiscuous mask defines include the correct
bits for each of the promiscuous modes.

To fix [2] make sure that all 4 cases are handled since there are 2 bits
(FLAG_VF_UNICAST_PROMISC and FLAG_VF_MULTICAST_PROMISC) that can be
either set or cleared. Also, since either unicast and/or multicast
promiscuous configuration can fail, introduce two separate error values
to handle each of these cases.
