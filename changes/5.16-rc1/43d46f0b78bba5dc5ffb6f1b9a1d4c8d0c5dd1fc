drm/ttm: s/FLAG_SG/FLAG_EXTERNAL/

It covers more than just ttm_bo_type_sg usage, like with say dma-buf,
since one other user is userptr in amdgpu, and in the future we might
have some more. Hence EXTERNAL is likely a more suitable name.

v2(Christian):
  - Rename these to TTM_TT_FLAGS_*
  - Fix up all the holes in the flag values
