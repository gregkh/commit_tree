counter: Add character device interface

This patch introduces a character device interface for the Counter
subsystem. Device data is exposed through standard character device read
operations. Device data is gathered when a Counter event is pushed by
the respective Counter device driver. Configuration is handled via ioctl
operations on the respective Counter character device node.
