KVM: x86: Remove defunct setting of CR0.ET for guests during vCPU create

Drop code to set CR0.ET for the guest during initialization of the guest
FPU.  The code was added as a misguided bug fix by commit 380102c8e431
("KVM Set the ET flag in CR0 after initializing FX") to resolve an issue
where vcpu->cr0 (now vcpu->arch.cr0) was not correctly initialized on SVM
systems.  While init_vmcb() did set CR0.ET, it only did so in the VMCB,
and subtly did not update vcpu->cr0.  Stuffing CR0.ET worked around the
immediate problem, but did not fix the real bug of vcpu->cr0 and the VMCB
being out of sync.  That underlying bug was eventually remedied by commit
18fa000ae453 ("KVM: SVM: Reset cr0 properly on vcpu reset").

No functional change intended.
