net: of: fix stub of_net helpers for CONFIG_NET=n

Moving the of_net code from drivers/of/ to net/core means we
no longer stub out the helpers when networking is disabled,
which leads to a randconfig build failure with at least one
ARM platform that calls this from non-networking code:

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: arch/arm/mach-mvebu/kirkwood.o: in function `kirkwood_dt_eth_fixup':
kirkwood.c:(.init.text+0x54): undefined reference to `of_get_mac_address'

Restore the way this worked before by changing that #ifdef
check back to testing for both CONFIG_OF and CONFIG_NET.
