Bluetooth: hci_h5: Fix (runtime)suspend issues on RTL8723BS HCIs

The recently added H5_WAKEUP_DISABLE h5->flags flag gets checked in
h5_btrtl_open(), but it gets set in h5_serdev_probe() *after*
calling  hci_uart_register_device() and thus after h5_btrtl_open()
is called, set this flag earlier.

Also on devices where suspend/resume involves fully re-probing the HCI,
runtime-pm suspend should not be used, make the runtime-pm setup
conditional on the H5_WAKEUP_DISABLE flag too.

This fixes the HCI being removed and then re-added every 10 seconds
because it was being reprobed as soon as it was runtime-suspended.
