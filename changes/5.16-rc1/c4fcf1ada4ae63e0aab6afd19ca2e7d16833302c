thermal/drivers/int340x: Improve the tcc offset saving for suspend/resume

When the driver resumes, the tcc offset is set back to its previous
value. But this only works if the value was user defined as otherwise
the offset isn't saved. This asymmetric logic is harder to maintain and
introduced some issues.

Improve the logic by saving the tcc offset in a suspend op, so the right
value is always restored after a resume.
