ASoC: rt5682s: Fix HP noise caused by SAR mode switch when the system resumes

When the system resumes from S3, if the system plays a beep,
there is continuous "Zizi.." noise from HP that could be heard.
It is caused by the SAR mode switch during the combo jack
re-detection which be executed parallelly in a workqueue
after the system resumes.

This patch changes the behavior of SAR mode switch to
avoid this issue.
