gre/sit: Don't generate link-local addr if addr_gen_mode is IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE

When addr_gen_mode is set to IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE, the link-local addr
should not be generated. But it isn't the case for GRE (as well as GRE6)
and SIT tunnels. Make it so that tunnels consider the addr_gen_mode,
especially for IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE.

Do this in add_v4_addrs() to cover both GRE and SIT only if the addr
scope is link.
