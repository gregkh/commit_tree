ice: allow process VF opcodes in different ways

In switchdev driver shouldn't add MAC, VLAN and promisc
filters on iavf demand but should return success to not
break normal iavf flow.

Achieve that by creating table of functions pointer with
default functions used to parse iavf command. While parse
iavf command, call correct function from table instead of
calling function direct.

When port representors are being created change functions
in table to new one that behaves correctly for switchdev
puprose (ignoring new filters).

Change back to default ops when representors are being
removed.
