libbpf: Fix endianness detection in BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD_PROBED()

__BYTE_ORDER is supposed to be defined by a libc, and __BYTE_ORDER__ -
by a compiler. bpf_core_read.h checks __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN,
which is true if neither are defined, leading to incorrect behavior on
big-endian hosts if libc headers are not included, which is often the
case.
