drm/i915/guc: Handle errors in multi-lrc requests

If an error occurs in the front end when multi-lrc requests are getting
generated we need to skip these in the backend but we still need to
emit the breadcrumbs seqno. An issues arises because with multi-lrc
breadcrumbs there is a handshake between the parent and children to make
forward progress. If all the requests are not present this handshake
doesn't work. To work around this, if multi-lrc request has an error we
skip the handshake but still emit the breadcrumbs seqno.

v3:
