scsi: core: Remove two host template members that are no longer used

All SCSI drivers have been converted to use shost_groups and sdev_groups
instead of shost_attrs or sdev_attrs. Hence remove shost_attrs and
sdev_attrs. Additionally, remove the 'lld_attr_group' members and also
the scsi_convert_dev_attrs() function.
