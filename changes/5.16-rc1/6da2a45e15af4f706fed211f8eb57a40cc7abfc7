perf beauty: Update copy of linux/socket.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  99ce45d5e7dbde39 ("mctp: Implement extended addressing")
  55c42fa7fa331f98 ("mptcp: add MPTCP_INFO getsockopt")

That don't result in any changes in the tables generated from that
header.

A table generator for setsockopt is needed, probably will be done in the
5.16 cycle.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/perf/trace/beauty/include/linux/socket.h' differs from latest version at 'include/linux/socket.h'
  diff -u tools/perf/trace/beauty/include/linux/socket.h include/linux/socket.h
