arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916-samsung-serranove: Add rt5033 battery

Like the Samsung Galaxy A3/A5, the S4 Mini VE uses a Richtek RT5033 PMIC
as battery fuel gauge, charger, flash LED and for some regulators.
For now, only add the fuel gauge/battery device to the device tree,
so we can check the remaining battery percentage.

The other RT5033 drivers need some more work first before
they can be used properly.
