irqchip: Provide stronger type checking for IRQCHIP_MATCH/IRQCHIP_DECLARE

Both IRQCHIP_DECLARE() and IRQCHIP_MATCH() use an underlying of_device_id()
structure to encode the matching property and the init callback.
However, this callback is stored in as a void * pointer, which obviously
defeat any attempt at stronger type checking.

Work around this by providing a new macro that builds on top of the
__typecheck() primitive, and that can be used to warn when there is
a discrepency between the drivers and core code.
