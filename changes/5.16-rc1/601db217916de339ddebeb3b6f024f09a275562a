dt-bindings: watchdog: sunxi: Add compatibles for D1

D1 keeps the same register layout and clock sources as the R329, but it
adds a key field which must be set to update the watchdog's "CFG" and
"MODE" registers. Therefore it is not backward-compatible.

Similarly to the R329, the D1 has three watchdog instances, and only one
of them has the "soft reset" registers. So that instance needs an extra
compatible string.
