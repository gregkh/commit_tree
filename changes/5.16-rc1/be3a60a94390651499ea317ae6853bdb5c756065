ARM: dts: ux500: Switch battery nodes to standard

This force-converts the per-device battery node into the standard
properties using "simple-battery" for the HREF machines and the
corresponding Samsung battery for the mobile phones.

This is fine to do since the battery data in the DTS files has never
been deployed or used. In commit a1149ae97554
"ARM: ux500: Disable Power Supply and Battery Management by default"
it was turned off and has not been switched back on since. In
the meantime standardized bindings for batteries have appeared
making the old AB8500 battery bindings obsolete.

The battery node which is now in the middle of an included file
is obviously a per-device piece of information so push this down
to each board. The HREF machines all have the same battery and can
share a single node in the HREF dtsi file.
