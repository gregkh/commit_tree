blk-mq: Add blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs()

Add a function to combine allocating tags and the associated requests,
and factor out common patterns to use this new function.

Some function only call blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs() now, but more
functionality will be added later.

Also make blk_mq_alloc_rq_map() and blk_mq_alloc_rqs() static since they
are only used in blk-mq.c, and finally rename some functions for
conciseness and consistency with other function names:
- __blk_mq_alloc_map_and_{request -> rqs}()
- blk_mq_alloc_{map_and_requests -> set_map_and_rqs}()
