drm/i915/pxp: set KCR reg init

The setting is required by hardware to allow us doing further protection
operation such as sending commands to GPU or TEE. The register needs to
be re-programmed on resume, so for simplicitly we bundle the programming
with the component binding, which is automatically called on resume.

Further HW set-up operations will be added in the same location in
follow-up patches, so get ready for them by using a couple of
init/fini_hw wrappers instead of calling the KCR funcs directly.

v3: move programming to component binding function, rework commit msg
