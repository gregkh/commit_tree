ASoC: SOF: sof-audio: add helpers for widgets, kcontrols and dai config set up

Refactor the existing code to use helper functions to
set up/free widgets, send dai config and set up kcontrols for
widgets. These will be reused later on for setting up widgets in
the connected DAPM widgets list for a particular PCM when the
dynamic pipeline feature is implemented.
