KVM: selftests: Fix kvm_vm_free() in cr4_cpuid_sync and vmx_tsc_adjust tests

The kvm_vm_free() statement here is currently dead code, since the loop
in front of it can only be left with the "goto done" that jumps right
after the kvm_vm_free(). Fix it by swapping the locations of the "done"
label and the kvm_vm_free().
