/dev/mem: nowait zero/null ops

Make read_iter_zero() to honor IOCB_NOWAIT, so /dev/zero can be
advertised as FMODE_NOWAIT. It's useful for io_uring, which needs it to
apply certain optimisations when doing I/O against the device.

Set FMODE_NOWAIT for /dev/null as well, it never waits and therefore
trivially meets the criteria.
