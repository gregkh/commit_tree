folio: Add a function to get the host inode for a folio

Add a convenience function, folio_inode() that will get the host inode from
a folio's mapping.

Changes:
 ver #3:
  - Fix mistake in function description[2].
 ver #2:
  - Fix contradiction between doc and implementation by disallowing use
    with swap caches[1].
