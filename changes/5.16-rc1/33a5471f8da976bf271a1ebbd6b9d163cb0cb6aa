video: backlight: Drop maximum brightness override for brightness zero

The note in c2adda27d202f ("video: backlight: Add of_find_backlight helper
in backlight.c") says that gpio-backlight uses brightness as power state.
This has been fixed since in ec665b756e6f7 ("backlight: gpio-backlight:
Correct initial power state handling") and other backlight drivers do not
require this workaround. Drop the workaround.

This fixes the case where e.g. pwm-backlight can perfectly well be set to
brightness 0 on boot in DT, which without this patch leads to the display
brightness to be max instead of off.
