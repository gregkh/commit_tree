net: amd-xgbe: Toggle PLL settings during rate change

For each rate change command submission, the FW has to do a phy
power off sequence internally. For this to happen correctly, the
PLL re-initialization control setting has to be turned off before
sending mailbox commands and re-enabled once the command submission
is complete.

Without the PLL control setting, the link up takes longer time in a
fixed phy configuration.
