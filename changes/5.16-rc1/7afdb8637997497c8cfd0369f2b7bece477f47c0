scsi: aacraid: Call scsi_done() directly

The aacraid driver invokes scmd->scsi_done(scmd) for two types of SCSI
commands:

 - SCSI commands initialized by the SCSI mid-layer.

 - SCSI commands initialized by aac_probe_container().

The processing sequence for SCSI commands allocated by
aac_probe_container() is as follows:

aac_probe_container()
-> _aac_probe_container(scmd, aac_probe_container_callback1)
  -> scmd->SCp.ptr = aac_probe_container_callback1
  -> aac_fib_send(..., _aac_probe_container1, scmd)
    -> fibptr->callback = _aac_probe_container1
    -> fibptr->callback_data = scmd

fibptr->callback(scmd)
-> _aac_probe_container1(scmd, fibptr)
   [ ... ]
   -> _aac_probe_container2(scmd, fibptr)
     -> Call scmd->SCp.ptr == aac_probe_container_callback1
       -> scmd->device = NULL;

The processing sequence for SCSI commands allocated by the SCSI mid-layer
if _aac_probe_container() is called is as follows:

aac_queuecommand()
-> aac_scsi_cmd()
  -> _aac_probe_container(scmd, aac_probe_container_callback2)
    -> scmd->SCp.ptr = aac_probe_container_callback2
    -> aac_fib_send(..., _aac_probe_container1, scmd)

fibptr->callback(scmd)
-> _aac_probe_container1(scmd, fibptr)
   [ ... ]
   -> _aac_probe_container2(scmd, fibptr)
     -> Call scmd->SCp.ptr == aac_probe_container_callback2

Preserve the existing call sequences by calling scsi_done() for commands
submitted by the mid-layer or aac_probe_container_scsi_done() for commands
submitted by aac_probe_container().
