kprobes: Make arch_check_ftrace_location static

arch_check_ftrace_location() was introduced as a weak function in
commit f7f242ff004499 ("kprobes: introduce weak
arch_check_ftrace_location() helper function") to allow architectures
to handle kprobes call site on their own.

Recently, the only architecture (csky) to implement
arch_check_ftrace_location() was migrated to using the common
version.

As a result, further cleanup the code to drop the weak attribute and
rename the function to remove the architecture specific
implementation.
