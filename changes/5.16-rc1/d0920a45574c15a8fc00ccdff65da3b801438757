drm/i915: Pass the lane to intel_ddi_level()

In order to have per-lane drive settings we need intel_ddi_level()
to accept the lane as a parameter. That is, the eventual goal is to
call intel_ddi_level() once for each lane. For now we just pass in
a hardcoded 0 and use the same settings for every lane. Ie. no
change in behaviour yet.
