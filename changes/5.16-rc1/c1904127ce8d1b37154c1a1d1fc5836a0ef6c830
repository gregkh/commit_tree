habanalabs: prevent race between fd close/open

The driver allows only a single process to open a device's FD at any
single time. This is done by checking "hdev->compute_ctx" under mutex.

Therefore, to prevent a race between the moment a user closes it's FD
and when another user tries to open the device, we need to make sure
that clearing this variable is the very last thing that is done in the
code of the FD's release.

I'm moving the idle check before clearing this variable and the
"reset on device release". btw, if the reset happens it will prevent
any other user from opening the device until the reset is finished.

An important thing to note is that we need to remove the user process
that is closing the device from the process list BEFORE calling the
reset function. That is to prevent a case where the reset code will
try to kill that user process and it is unnecessary as the process
doesn't hold any device/driver resources anymore.
