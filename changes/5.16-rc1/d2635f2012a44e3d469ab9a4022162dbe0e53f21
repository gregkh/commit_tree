mm: create a new system state and fix core_kernel_text()

core_kernel_text() considers that until system_state in at least
SYSTEM_RUNNING, init memory is valid.

But init memory is freed a few lines before setting SYSTEM_RUNNING, so
we have a small period of time when core_kernel_text() is wrong.

Create an intermediate system state called SYSTEM_FREEING_INIT that is
set before starting freeing init memory, and use it in
core_kernel_text() to report init memory invalid earlier.
