ASoC: qdsp6: q6afe-dai: move lpass audio ports to common file

Various Q6DSP frameworks will use LPASS Audio IP, so move all the hardware
specific details to a common file so that they could be reused across
multiple Q6DSP frameworks.

In this case all the audio ports definitions can be moved to a common file
to be able to reuse across multiple Q6DSP frameworks.
