nfs4: take a reference on the nfs_client when running FREE_STATEID

During umount, the session slot tables are freed.  If there are
outstanding FREE_STATEID tasks, a use-after-free and slab corruption can
occur when rpc_exit_task calls rpc_call_done -> nfs41_sequence_done ->
nfs4_sequence_process/nfs41_sequence_free_slot.

Prevent that from happening by taking a reference on the nfs_client in
nfs41_free_stateid and putting it in nfs41_free_stateid_release.
