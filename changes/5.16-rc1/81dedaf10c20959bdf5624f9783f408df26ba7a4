fs: reiserfs: remove useless new_opts in reiserfs_remount

Since the commit c3d98ea08291 ("VFS: Don't use save/replace_mount_options
if not using generic_show_options") eliminates replace_mount_options
in reiserfs_remount, but does not handle the allocated new_opts,
it will cause memory leak in the reiserfs_remount.

Because new_opts is useless in reiserfs_mount, so we fix this bug by
removing the useless new_opts in reiserfs_remount.

Fixes: c3d98ea08291 ("VFS: Don't use save/replace_mount_options if not using generic_show_options")
