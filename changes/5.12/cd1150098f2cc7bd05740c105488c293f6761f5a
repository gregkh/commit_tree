net: ipa: avoid field overflow

It's possible that the length passed to ipa_header_size_encoded()
is larger than what can be represented by the HDR_LEN field alone
(starting with IPA v4.5).  If we attempted that, u32_encode_bits()
would trigger a build-time error.

Avoid this problem by masking off high-order bits of the value
encoded as the lower portion of the header length.

The same sort of problem exists in ipa_metadata_offset_encoded(),
so implement the same fix there.
