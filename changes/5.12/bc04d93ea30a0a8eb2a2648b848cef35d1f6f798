vdpa/mlx5: Fix suspend/resume index restoration

When we suspend the VM, the VDPA interface will be reset. When the VM is
resumed again, clear_virtqueues() will clear the available and used
indices resulting in hardware virqtqueue objects becoming out of sync.
We can avoid this function alltogether since qemu will clear them if
required, e.g. when the VM went through a reboot.

Moreover, since the hw available and used indices should always be
identical on query and should be restored to the same value same value
for virtqueues that complete in order, we set the single value provided
by set_vq_state(). In get_vq_state() we return the value of hardware
used index.
