net/mlx5: Fix setting of devlink traps in switchdev mode

Prevent setting of devlink traps on the uplink while in switchdev mode.
In this mode, it is the SW switch responsibility to handle both packets
with a mismatch in destination MAC or VLAN ID. Therefore, there are no
flow steering tables to trap undesirable packets and driver crashes upon
setting a trap.
