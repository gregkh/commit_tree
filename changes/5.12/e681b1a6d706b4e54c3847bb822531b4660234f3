ASoC: qcom: Fix typo error in HDMI regmap config callbacks

Had a typo in lpass platform driver that resulted in crash
during suspend/resume with an HDMI dongle connected.

The regmap read/write/volatile regesters validation callbacks in lpass-cpu
were using MI2S rdma_channels count instead of hdmi_rdma_channels.

This typo error causing to read registers from the regmap beyond the length
of the mapping created by ioremap().

This fix avoids the need for reducing number hdmi_rdma_channels,
which is done in
commit 7dfe20ee92f6 ("ASoC: qcom: Fix number of HDMI RDMA channels on sc7180").
So reverting the same.

Fixes: 7cb37b7bd0d3c ("ASoC: qcom: Add support for lpass hdmi driver")
