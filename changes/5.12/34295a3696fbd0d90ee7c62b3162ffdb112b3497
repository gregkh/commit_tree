ice: implement new LLDP filter command

There is an issue with some NVMs where an already existent LLDP
filter is blocking the creation of a filter to allow LLDP packets
to be redirected to the default VSI for the interface.  This is
blocking all LLDP functionality based in the kernel when the FW
LLDP agent is disabled (e.g. software based DCBx).

Implement the new AQ command to allow adding VSI destinations to
existent filters on NVM versions that support the new command.

The new lldp_fltr_ctrl AQ command supports Rx filters only, so the
code flow for adding filters to disable Tx of control frames will
remain intact.
