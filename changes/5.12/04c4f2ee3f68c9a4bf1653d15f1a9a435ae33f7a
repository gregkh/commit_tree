KVM: VMX: Don't use vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an array index

__vmx_handle_exit() uses vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an index for
an array access.  Since vcpu->run is (can be) mapped to a user address
space with a writer permission, the 'ndata' could be updated by the
user process at anytime (the user process can set it to outside the
bounds of the array).
So, it is not safe that __vmx_handle_exit() uses the 'ndata' that way.
