usbip: add sysfs_lock to synchronize sysfs code paths

Fuzzing uncovered race condition between sysfs code paths in usbip
drivers. Device connect/disconnect code paths initiated through
sysfs interface are prone to races if disconnect happens during
connect and vice versa.

This problem is common to all drivers while it can be reproduced easily
in vhci_hcd. Add a sysfs_lock to usbip_device struct to protect the paths.

Use this in vhci_hcd to protect sysfs paths. For a complete fix, usip_host
and usip-vudc drivers and the event handler will have to use this lock to
protect the paths. These changes will be done in subsequent patches.
