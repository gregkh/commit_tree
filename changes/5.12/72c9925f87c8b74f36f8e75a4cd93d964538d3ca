btrfs: fix extent buffer leak on failure to copy root

At btrfs_copy_root(), if the call to btrfs_inc_ref() fails we end up
returning without unlocking and releasing our reference on the extent
buffer named "cow" we previously allocated with btrfs_alloc_tree_block().

So fix that by unlocking the extent buffer and dropping our reference on
it before returning.
