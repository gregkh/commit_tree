perf stat: Support L2 Topdown events

The TMA method level 2 metrics is supported from the Intel Sapphire
Rapids server, which expose four L2 Topdown metrics events to user
space. There are eight L2 events in total. The other four L2 Topdown
metrics events are calculated from the corresponding L1 and the exposed
L2 events.

Now, the --topdown prints the complete top-down metrics that supported
by the CPU. For the Intel Sapphire Rapids server, there are 4 L1 events
and 8 L2 events displyed in one line.

Add a new option, --td-level, to display the top-down statistics that
equal to or lower than the input level.

The L2 event is marked only when both its L1 parent event and itself
crosse the threshold.

Here is an example:

  $ perf stat --topdown --td-level=2 --no-metric-only sleep 1
  Topdown accuracy may decrease when measuring long periods.
  Please print the result regularly, e.g. -I1000
