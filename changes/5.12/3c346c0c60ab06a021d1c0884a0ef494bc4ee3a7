KVM: SVM: ensure that EFER.SVME is set when running nested guest or on nested vmexit

Fixing nested_vmcb_check_save to avoid all TOC/TOU races
is a bit harder in released kernels, so do the bare minimum
by avoiding that EFER.SVME is cleared.  This is problematic
because svm_set_efer frees the data structures for nested
virtualization if EFER.SVME is cleared.

Also check that EFER.SVME remains set after a nested vmexit;
clearing it could happen if the bit is zero in the save area
that is passed to KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE (the save area of the
nested state corresponds to the nested hypervisor's state
and is restored on the next nested vmexit).
