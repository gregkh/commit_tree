xhci: move and rename xhci_cleanup_halted_endpoint()

Halted endpoints can be discoverd both when handling transfer events and
command completion events. Move code that handles halted endpoints before
both of those event handlers.

Rename the function to xhci_handle_halted_ep() to better describe
what it does. Try to reserve "cleanup" word in function names for last
stage cleanup activities.

No functional changes
