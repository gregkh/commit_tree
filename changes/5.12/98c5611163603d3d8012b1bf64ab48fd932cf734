octeontx2-af: cn10k: Add mbox support for CN10K platform

Firmware allocates memory regions for PFs and VFs in DRAM.
The PFs memory region is used for AF-PF and PF-VF mailbox.
This mbox facilitates communication between AF-PF and PF-VF.

On CN10K platform:
The DRAM region allocated to PF is enumerated as PF BAR4 memory.
PF BAR4 contains AF-PF mbox region followed by its VFs mbox region.
AF-PF mbox region base address is configured at RVU_AF_PFX_BAR4_ADDR
PF-VF mailbox base address is configured at
RVU_PF(x)_VF_MBOX_ADDR = RVU_AF_PF()_BAR4_ADDR+64KB. PF access its
mbox region via BAR4, whereas VF accesses PF-VF DRAM mailboxes via
BAR2 indirect access.

On CN9XX platform:
Mailbox region in DRAM is divided into two parts AF-PF mbox region and
PF-VF mbox region i.e all PFs mbox region is contiguous similarly all
VFs.
The base address of the AF-PF mbox region is configured at
RVU_AF_PF_BAR4_ADDR.
AF-PF1 mbox address can be calculated as RVU_AF_PF_BAR4_ADDR * mbox
size.
The base address of PF-VF mbox region for each PF is configure at
RVU_AF_PF(0..15)_VF_BAR4_ADDR.PF access its mbox region via BAR4 and its
VF mbox regions from RVU_PF_VF_BAR4_ADDR register, whereas VF access its
mbox region via BAR4.

This patch changes mbox initialization to support both CN9XX and CN10K
platform.

This patch also adds CN10K PTP subsystem and device IDs to ptp
driver id table.
