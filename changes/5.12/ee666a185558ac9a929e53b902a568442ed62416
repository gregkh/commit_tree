tracing: Skip selftests if tracing is disabled

If tracing is disabled for some reason (traceoff_on_warning, command line,
etc), the ftrace selftests are guaranteed to fail, as their results are
defined by trace data in the ring buffers. If the ring buffers are turned
off, the tests will fail, due to lack of data.

Because tracing being disabled is for a specific reason (warning, user
decided to, etc), it does not make sense to enable tracing to run the self
tests, as the test output may corrupt the reason for the tracing to be
disabled.

Instead, simply skip the self tests and report that they are being skipped
due to tracing being disabled.
