ARM: dts: sunxi: Rename nmi_intc to r_intc

The R_INTC block controls more than just the NMI, and it is a different
hardware block than the NMI INTC found in some other Allwinner SoCs, so
the label "nmi_intc" is inaccurate. Name it "r_intc" to match the
compatible and to match the few references in the vendor documentation.
