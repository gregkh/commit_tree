fs-verity: don't pass whole descriptor to fsverity_verify_signature()

Now that fsverity_get_descriptor() validates the sig_size field,
fsverity_verify_signature() doesn't need to do it.

Just change the prototype of fsverity_verify_signature() to take the
signature directly rather than take a fsverity_descriptor.
