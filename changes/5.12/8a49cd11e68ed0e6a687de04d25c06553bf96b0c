ASoC: SOF: ACPI: avoid reverse module dependency

The SOF-ACPI driver is backwards from the normal Linux model, it has a
generic driver that knows about all the specific drivers, as opposed to
having hardware specific drivers that link against a common framework.

This requires ugly Kconfig magic and leads to missed dependencies as
seen in this link error:

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: sound/soc/sof/sof-pci-dev.o: in function `sof_acpi_probe':
sof-pci-dev.c:(.text+0x1c): undefined reference to `snd_intel_dsp_driver_probe'

Change it to use the normal probe order of starting with a specific
device in a driver, turning the sof-acpi-dev.c driver into a
library (exported symbols are name-spaced to avoid symbol pollution).

For backwards-compatibility with previous Kconfigs, the default values
for platform drivers uses the top-level ACPI configurations. The
modules were also renamed to allow for gradual transitions in test
scripts.
