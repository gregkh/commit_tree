regulator: bd9571mwv: Fix AVS and DVFS voltage range

According to Table 30 ("DVFS_MoniVDAC [6:0] Setting Table") in the
BD9571MWV-M Datasheet Rev. 002, the valid voltage range is 600..1100 mV
(settings 0x3c..0x6e).  While the lower limit is taken into account (by
setting regulator_desc.linear_min_sel to 0x3c), the upper limit is not.

Fix this by reducing regulator_desc.n_voltages from 0x80 to 0x6f.
