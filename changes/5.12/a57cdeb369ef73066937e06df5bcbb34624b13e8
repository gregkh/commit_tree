sparc: sparc64_defconfig: add necessary configs for qemu

The sparc64 qemu machines uses sunhme network hardware by default, so for
simple NFS boot testing using qemu, having CONFIG_HAPPYMEAL is useful.
And so we need also IP_PNP_DHCP for NFS boot.
For the same reason we need to enable its storage which is a PATA_CMD64.
And finally, we need CONFIG_DEVTMPFS for handling recent udev/systemd.

All those options will permit to enable boot testing in both kernelCI
and gentoo's kernelCI.
