mhi: pci_generic: Add health-check

If the modem crashes for any reason, we may not be able to detect
it at MHI level (MHI registers not reachable anymore).

This patch implements a health-check mechanism to check regularly
that device is alive (MHI layer can communicate with). If device
is not alive (because a crash or unexpected reset), the recovery
procedure is triggered.

Tested successfully with Telit FN980m module.
