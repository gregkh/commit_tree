gpio: pca953x: Set IRQ type when handle Intel Galileo Gen 2

The commit 0ea683931adb ("gpio: dwapb: Convert driver to using the
GPIO-lib-based IRQ-chip") indeliberately made a regression on how
IRQ line from GPIO IÂ²C expander is handled. I.e. it reveals that
the quirk for Intel Galileo Gen 2 misses the part of setting IRQ type
which previously was predefined by gpio-dwapb driver. Now, we have to
reorganize the approach to call necessary parts, which can be done via
ACPI_GPIO_QUIRK_ABSOLUTE_NUMBER quirk.

Without this fix and with above mentioned change the kernel hangs
on the first IRQ event with:

    gpio gpiochip3: Persistence not supported for GPIO 1
    irq 32, desc: 62f8fb50, depth: 0, count: 0, unhandled: 0
    ->handle_irq():  41c7b0ab, handle_bad_irq+0x0/0x40
    ->irq_data.chip(): e03f1e72, 0xc2539218
    ->action(): 0ecc7e6f
    ->action->handler(): 8a3db21e, irq_default_primary_handler+0x0/0x10
       IRQ_NOPROBE set
    unexpected IRQ trap at vector 20
