arm64: dts: zynqmp: Add missing mio-bank properties to sdhcis

Add missing xlnx,mio-bank property to sdhci nodes. Also add properties with
0 value to have it listed in case that files are copied to different
projects where default case doesn't need to be handled in the same way.
That's why explicitly list them too.
