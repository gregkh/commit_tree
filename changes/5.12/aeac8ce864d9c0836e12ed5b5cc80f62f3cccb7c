ice: Recognize 860 as iSCSI port in CEE mode

iSCSI can use both TCP ports 860 and 3260. However, in our current
implementation, the ice_aqc_opc_get_cee_dcb_cfg (0x0A07) AQ command
doesn't provide a way to communicate the protocol port number to the
AQ's caller. Thus, we assume that 3260 is the iSCSI port number at the
AQ's caller layer.

Rely on the dcbx-willing mode, desired QoS and remote QoS configuration to
determine which port number that iSCSI will use.
