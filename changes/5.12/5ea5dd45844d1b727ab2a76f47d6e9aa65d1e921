io_uring: inline io_read()'s iovec freeing

io_read() has not the simpliest control flow with a lot of jumps and
it's hard to read. One of those is a out_free: label, which frees iovec.
However, from the middle of io_read() iovec is NULL'ed and so
kfree(iovec) is no-op, it leaves us with two place where we can inline
it and further clean up the code.
