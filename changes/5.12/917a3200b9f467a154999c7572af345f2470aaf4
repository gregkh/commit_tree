dmaengine: tegra20: Fix runtime PM imbalance on error

pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the runtime PM counter
even it returns an error. Thus a pairing decrement is needed
to prevent refcount leak. Fix this by replacing this API with
pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), which will not change the runtime
PM counter on error.
