gfs2: Add trusted xattr support

Add support for an additional filesystem version (sb_fs_format = 1802).
When a filesystem with the new version is mounted, the filesystem
supports "trusted.*" xattrs.

In addition, version 1802 filesystems implement a form of forward
compatibility for xattrs: when xattrs with an unknown prefix (ea_type)
are found on a version 1802 filesystem, those attributes are not shown
by listxattr, and they are not accessible by getxattr, setxattr, or
removexattr.

This mechanism might turn out to be what we need in the future, but if
not, we can always bump the filesystem version and break compatibility
instead.
