mm/highmem.c: fix zero_user_segments() with start > end

zero_user_segments() is used from __block_write_begin_int(), for example
like the following

	zero_user_segments(page, 4096, 1024, 512, 918)

But new the zero_user_segments() implementation for for HIGHMEM +
TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE doesn't handle "start > end" case correctly, and hits
BUG_ON().  (we can fix __block_write_begin_int() instead though, it is the
old and multiple usage)

Also it calls kmap_atomic() unnecessarily while start == end == 0.
