RDMA/mlx5: Fail QP creation if the device can not support the CQE TS

In ConnectX6Dx device, HW can work in real time timestamp mode according
to the device capabilities per RQ/SQ/QP.

When the flag IB_UVERBS_CQ_FLAGS_TIMESTAMP_COMPLETION is set, the user
expect to get TS on the CQEs in free running format, so we need to fail
the QP creation if the current mode of the device doesn't support it.
