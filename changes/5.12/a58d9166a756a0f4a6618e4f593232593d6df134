KVM: SVM: load control fields from VMCB12 before checking them

Avoid races between check and use of the nested VMCB controls.  This
for example ensures that the VMRUN intercept is always reflected to the
nested hypervisor, instead of being processed by the host.  Without this
patch, it is possible to end up with svm->nested.hsave pointing to
the MSR permission bitmap for nested guests.

This bug is CVE-2021-29657.
