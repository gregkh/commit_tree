mm/gfp: add kernel-doc for gfp_t

The generated html will link to the definition of the gfp_t automatically
once we define it.  Move the one-paragraph overview of GFP flags from the
documentation directory into gfp.h and pull gfp.h into the documentation.

This generates warnings with clang
(https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210219195509.GA59987@24bbad8f3778), so
use a #if 0 to hide it from the compiler for now.
