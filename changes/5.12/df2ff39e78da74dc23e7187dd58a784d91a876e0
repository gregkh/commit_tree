mm: cma: allocate cma areas bottom-up

Currently cma areas without a fixed base are allocated close to the end of
the node.  This placement is sub-optimal because of compaction: it brings
pages into the cma area.  In particular, it can bring in hot executable
pages, even if there is a plenty of free memory on the machine.  This
results in cma allocation failures.

Instead let's place cma areas close to the beginning of a node.  In this
case the compaction will help to free cma areas, resulting in better cma
allocation success rates.

If there is enough memory let's try to allocate bottom-up starting with
4GB to exclude any possible interference with DMA32.  On smaller machines
or in a case of a failure, stick with the old behavior.

16GB vm, 2GB cma area:
