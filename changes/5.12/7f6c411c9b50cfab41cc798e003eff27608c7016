hostfs: fix memory handling in follow_link()

1) argument should not be freed in any case - the caller already has
it as ->s_fs_info (and uses it a lot afterwards)
2) allocate readlink buffer with kmalloc() - the caller has no way
to tell if it's got that (on absolute symlink) or a result of
kasprintf().  Sure, for SLAB and SLUB kfree() works on results of
kmem_cache_alloc(), but that's not documented anywhere, might change
in the future *and* is already not true for SLOB.
