mm: memcontrol: optimize per-lruvec stats counter memory usage

The vmstat threshold is 32 (MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH), Actually the threshold
can be as big as MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH * PAGE_SIZE.  It still fits into s32.
So introduce struct batched_lruvec_stat to optimize memory usage.

The size of struct lruvec_stat is 304 bytes on 64 bit systems.  As it is a
per-cpu structure.  So with this patch, we can save 304 / 2 * ncpu bytes
per-memcg per-node where ncpu is the number of the possible CPU.  If there
are c memory cgroup (include dying cgroup) and n NUMA node in the system.
Finally, we can save (152 * ncpu * c * n) bytes.
