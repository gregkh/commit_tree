ia64: tools: remove duplicate definition of ia64_mf() on ia64

The ia64_mf() macro defined in tools/arch/ia64/include/asm/barrier.h is
already defined in <asm/gcc_intrin.h> on ia64 which causes libbpf
failing to build:

        |
  cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

Thus, remove the definition from tools/arch/ia64/include/asm/barrier.h.
