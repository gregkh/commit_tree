staging/mt7621-dma: mtk-hsdma.c->hsdma-mt7621.c

Also use KBUILD_MODNAME for module name.

This driver is only used by RALINK MIPS MT7621 SoCs. Tested by building
against that target using OpenWrt with Linux 5.10.10.

Fixes the following error:
error: the following would cause module name conflict:
  drivers/dma/mediatek/mtk-hsdma.ko
  drivers/staging/mt7621-dma/mtk-hsdma.ko
