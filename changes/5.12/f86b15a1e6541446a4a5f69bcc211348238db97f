ACPI: thermal: Clean up printing messages

Replace the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() instances in thermal.c with
acpi_handle_debug() calls and modify the ACPI_THERMAL_TRIPS_EXCEPTION()
macro in there to use acpi_handle_info() internally,  which among other
things causes the excessive log level of the messages printed by it to
be increased.

Drop the _COMPONENT and ACPI_MODULE_NAME() definitions that are not
used any more from thermal.c, drop the no longer needed
ACPI_THERMAL_COMPONENT definition from the headers and update the
documentation accordingly.

While at it, add a pr_fmt() definition to thermal.c, drop the PREFIX
definition from there and replace some pr_warn() calls with pr_info()
or acpi_handle_info() to reduce the excessive log level and (in the
latter case) facilitate easier identification of the message source.
