thermal/core: Add NULL pointer check before using cooling device stats

There is a possible chance that some cooling device stats buffer
allocation fails due to very high cooling device max state value.
Later cooling device update sysfs can try to access stats data
for the same cooling device. It will lead to NULL pointer
dereference issue.

Add a NULL pointer check before accessing thermal cooling device
stats data. It fixes the following bug
