Input: s6sy761 - fix coordinate read bit shift

The touch coordinate register contains the following:

        byte 3             byte 2             byte 1
+--------+--------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
|        |        | |                 | |                 |
| X[3:0] | Y[3:0] | |     Y[11:4]     | |     X[11:4]     |
|        |        | |                 | |                 |
+--------+--------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+

Bytes 2 and 1 need to be shifted left by 4 bits, the least significant
nibble of each is stored in byte 3. Currently they are only
being shifted by 3 causing the reported coordinates to be incorrect.

This matches downstream examples, and has been confirmed on my
device (OnePlus 7 Pro).
