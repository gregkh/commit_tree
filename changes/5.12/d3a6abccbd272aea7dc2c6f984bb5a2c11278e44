ibmvnic: remove duplicate napi_schedule call in do_reset function

During adapter reset, do_reset/do_hard_reset calls ibmvnic_open(),
which will calls napi_schedule if previous state is VNIC_CLOSED
(i.e, the reset case, and "ifconfig down" case). So there is no need
for do_reset to call napi_schedule again at the end of the function
though napi_schedule will neglect the request if napi is already
scheduled.
