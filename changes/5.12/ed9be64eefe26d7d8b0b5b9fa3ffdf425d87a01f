HID: make arrays usage and value to be the same

The HID subsystem allows an "HID report field" to have a different
number of "values" and "usages" when it is allocated. When a field
struct is created, the size of the usage array is guaranteed to be at
least as large as the values array, but it may be larger. This leads to
a potential out-of-bounds write in
__hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() and an out-of-bounds read in
hidinput_count_leds().

To fix this, let's make sure that both the usage and value arrays are
the same size.
