media: cedrus: Remove checking for required controls

According to v4l2 request api specifications, it's allowed to skip
control if its content isn't changed for performance reasons. Cedrus
driver predates that, so it has implemented mechanism to check if all
required controls are included in one request.

Conform to specifications with removing that mechanism.

Note that this mechanism with static required flag isn't very good
anyway because need for control is usually signaled in other controls.
