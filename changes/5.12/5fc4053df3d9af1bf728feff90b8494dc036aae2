mlxsw: ethtool: Remove max lanes filtering

Currently, when a speed can be supported by different number of lanes,
the supported link modes bitmask contains only link modes with a single
number of lanes.

This was done in order to prevent auto negotiation on number of
lanes after 50G-1-lane and 100G-2-lanes link modes were introduced.

For example, if a port's max width is 4, only link modes with 4 lanes
will be presented as supported by that port, so 100G is always achieved by
4 lanes of 25G.

After the previous patches that allow selection of the number of lanes,
auto negotiation on number of lanes becomes practical.

Remove that filtering of the maximum number of lanes supported link modes,
so indeed all the supported and advertised link modes will be shown.
