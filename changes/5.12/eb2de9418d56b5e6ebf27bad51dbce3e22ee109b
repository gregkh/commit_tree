io-wq: fix race around io_worker grabbing

There's a small window between lookup dropping the reference to the
worker and calling wake_up_process() on the worker task, where the worker
itself could have exited. We ensure that the worker struct itself is
valid, but worker->task may very well be gone by the time we issue the
wakeup.

Fix the race by using a completion triggered by the reference going to
zero, and having exit wait for that completion before proceeding.
