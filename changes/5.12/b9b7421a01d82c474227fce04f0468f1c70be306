octeontx2-af: Support ESP/AH RSS hashing

Support SPI and sequence number fields of
ESP/AH header to be hashed for RSS. By default
ESP/AH fields are not considered for RSS and
needs to be set explicitly as below:
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash esp4 sdfn
or
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash ah4 sdfn
or
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash esp6 sdfn
or
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash ah6 sdfn

To disable hashing of ESP fields:
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash esp4 sd
or
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash ah4 sd
or
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash esp6 sd
or
ethtool -U eth0 rx-flow-hash ah6 sd
