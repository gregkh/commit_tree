pwm: rockchip: Enable clock before calling clk_get_rate()

The documentation for clk_get_rate() in include/linux/clk.h states the
function's result is valid only for a clock source that has been
enabled. However, the Rockchip PWM driver uses this function in two places
to query the rate of a clock without first ensuring it is enabled.

Fix this by modifying rockchip_pwm_get_state() and rockchip_pwm_apply() so
they enable a device's PWM clock before querying its rate (in the latter
case, the querying is actually done in rockchip_pwm_config()) and disable
the clock again before returning.
