arm64: Provide an 'upgrade to VHE' stub hypercall

As we are about to change the way a VHE system boots, let's
provide the core helper, in the form of a stub hypercall that
enables VHE and replicates the full EL1 context at EL2, thanks
to EL1 and VHE-EL2 being extremely similar.

On exception return, the kernel carries on at EL2. Fancy!

Nothing calls this new hypercall yet, so no functional change.
