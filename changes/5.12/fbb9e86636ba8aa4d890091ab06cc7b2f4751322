arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: Switch to macros for RSB clock/reset indices

The macros for the clock and reset indices for the RSB hardware block
were replaced with raw numbers when the RSB controller node was added.
This was done to avoid cross-tree dependencies.

Now that both the clk and DT changes have been merged, we can switch
back to using the macros.
