scsi: qla1280: Fix printk regression

Since Linus Torvalds reinstated KERN_CONT in commit 4bcc595ccd80 ("printk:
reinstate KERN_CONT for printing continuation lines") in 2015, the qla1280
SCSI driver printed a rather ugly and screen real estate wasting multi-line
per device status glibberish during boot. Fix this by adding KERN_CONT as
needed.
