xfs: pass flags and return gc errors from xfs_blockgc_free_quota

Change the signature of xfs_blockgc_free_quota in preparation for the
next few patches.  Callers can now pass EOF_FLAGS into the function to
control scan parameters; and the function will now pass back any
corruption errors seen while scanning, though for our retry loops we'll
just try again unconditionally.
