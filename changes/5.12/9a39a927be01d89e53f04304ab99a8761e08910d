Bluetooth: btqcomsmd: Fix a resource leak in error handling paths in the probe function

Some resource should be released in the error handling path of the probe
function, as already done in the remove function.

The remove function was fixed in commit 5052de8deff5 ("soc: qcom: smd:
Transition client drivers from smd to rpmsg")

Fixes: 1511cc750c3d ("Bluetooth: Introduce Qualcomm WCNSS SMD based HCI driver")
