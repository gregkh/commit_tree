media: uvcvideo: Implement UVC_EXT_GPIO_UNIT

Some devices can implement a physical switch to disable the input of the
camera on demand. Think of it like an elegant privacy sticker.

The system can read the status of the privacy switch via a GPIO.

It is important to know the status of the switch, e.g. to notify the
user when the camera will produce black frames and a videochat
application is used.

In some systems, the GPIO is connected to the main SoC instead of the
camera controller, with the connection reported by the system firmware
(ACPI or DT). In that case, the UVC device isn't aware of the GPIO. We
need to implement a virtual entity to handle the GPIO fully on the
driver side.

For example, for ACPI-based systems, the GPIO is reported in the USB
device object:

  Scope (\_SB.PCI0.XHCI.RHUB.HS07)
  {

	  /.../

    Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
    {
        GpioIo (Exclusive, PullDefault, 0x0000, 0x0000, IoRestrictionOutputOnly,
            "\\_SB.PCI0.GPIO", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
            )
            {   // Pin list
                0x0064
            }
    })
    Name (_DSD, Package (0x02)  // _DSD: Device-Specific Data
    {
        ToUUID ("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301") /* Device Properties for _DSD */,
        Package (0x01)
        {
            Package (0x02)
            {
                "privacy-gpio",
                Package (0x04)
                {
                    \_SB.PCI0.XHCI.RHUB.HS07,
                    Zero,
                    Zero,
                    One
                }
            }
        }
    })
  }
