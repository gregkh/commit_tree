drm/i915: Fix invalid access to ACPI _DSM objects

intel_dsm_platform_mux_info() tries to parse the ACPI package data
from _DSM for the debug information, but it assumes the fixed format
without checking what values are stored in the elements actually.
When an unexpected value is returned from BIOS, it may lead to GPF or
NULL dereference, as reported recently.

Add the checks of the contents in the returned values and skip the
values for invalid cases.

v1->v2: Check the info contents before dereferencing, too
