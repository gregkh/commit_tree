platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Disable DYTC CQL mode around switching to balanced mode

Testing has shown that setting /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile to
"balanced" when /sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/dytc_lapmode
reports 1, causes dytc_lapmode to get reset to 0 and then it becomes
stuck at 0 for aprox. 30 minutes even if the laptop is used on a lap.

Disabling CQL (when enabled) before issuing the DYTC_CMD_RESET to get
back to balanced mode and re-enabling it afterwards again, like the
code already does when switching to low-power / performance mode fixes
this.
