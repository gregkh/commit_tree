rcu: Make RCU_BOOST default on CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, RCU callbacks are deferred to the `rcuc' kthread.
This can stall RCU grace periods due to lengthy preemption not only of RCU
readers but also of 'rcuc' kthreads, either of which prevent grace periods
from completing, which can in turn result in OOM.  Because PREEMPT_RT
kernels have more kthreads that can block grace periods, it is more
important for such kernels to enable RCU_BOOST.

This commit therefore makes RCU_BOOST the default on PREEMPT_RT.
RCU_BOOST can still be manually disabled if need be.
