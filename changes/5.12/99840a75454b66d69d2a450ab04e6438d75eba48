KVM: SVM: Connect 'npt' module param to KVM's internal 'npt_enabled'

Directly connect the 'npt' param to the 'npt_enabled' variable so that
runtime adjustments to npt_enabled are reflected in sysfs.  Move the
!PAE restriction to a runtime check to ensure NPT is forced off if the
host is using 2-level paging, and add a comment explicitly stating why
NPT requires a 64-bit kernel or a kernel with PAE enabled.

Opportunistically switch the param to octal permissions.
