scsi: Revert "qla2xxx: Make sure that aborted commands are freed"

Calling vha->hw->tgt.tgt_ops->free_cmd() from qlt_xmit_response() is wrong
since the command for which a response is sent must remain valid until the
SCSI target core calls .release_cmd(). It has been observed that the
following scenario triggers a kernel crash:

 - qlt_xmit_response() calls qlt_check_reserve_free_req()

 - qlt_check_reserve_free_req() returns -EAGAIN

 - qlt_xmit_response() calls vha->hw->tgt.tgt_ops->free_cmd(cmd)

 - transport_handle_queue_full() tries to retransmit the response

Fix this crash by reverting the patch that introduced it.
