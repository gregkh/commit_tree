i2c: i2c-mux-gpio: Enable this driver in ACPI land

Enable i2c-mux-gpio devices to be defined via ACPI. The idle-state
property translates directly to a fwnode_property_*() call. The child
reg property translates naturally into _ADR in ACPI.

The i2c-parent binding is a relic from the days when the bindings
dictated that all direct children of an I2C controller had to be I2C
devices. These days that's no longer required. The i2c-mux can sit as a
direct child of its parent controller, which is where it makes the most
sense from a hardware description perspective. For the ACPI
implementation we'll assume that's always how the i2c-mux-gpio is
instantiated.
