drm/tegra: Fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync() fails

The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on return in
these Tegra functions.

However, pm_runtime_get_sync() will increment the PM reference count
even on failure. Forgetting to put the reference again will result in
a leak.

Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to keep the usage counter
balanced.
