sch_htb: Stats for offloaded HTB

This commit adds support for statistics of offloaded HTB. Bytes and
packets counters for leaf and inner nodes are supported, the values are
taken from per-queue qdiscs, and the numbers that the user sees should
have the same behavior as the software (non-offloaded) HTB.
