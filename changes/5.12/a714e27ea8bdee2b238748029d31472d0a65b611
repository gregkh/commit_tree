net: macb: fix the restore of cmp registers

Commit a14d273ba159 ("net: macb: restore cmp registers on resume path")
introduces the restore of CMP registers on resume path. In case the IP
doesn't support type 2 screeners (zero on DCFG8 register) the
struct macb::rx_fs_list::list is not initialized and thus the
list_for_each_entry(item, &bp->rx_fs_list.list, list) loop introduced in
commit a14d273ba159 ("net: macb: restore cmp registers on resume path")
will access an uninitialized list leading to crash. Thus, initialize
the struct macb::rx_fs_list::list without taking into account if the
IP supports type 2 screeners or not.
