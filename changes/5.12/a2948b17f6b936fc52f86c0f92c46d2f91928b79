libnvdimm/region: Fix nvdimm_has_flush() to handle ND_REGION_ASYNC

In case a platform doesn't provide explicit flush-hints but provides an
explicit flush callback via ND_REGION_ASYNC region flag, then
nvdimm_has_flush() still returns '0' indicating that writes do not
require flushing. This happens on PPC64 with patch at [1] applied, where
'deep_flush' of a region was denied even though an explicit flush
function was provided.

Fix this by adding a condition to nvdimm_has_flush() to test for the
ND_REGION_ASYNC flag on the region and see if a 'region->flush' callback
is assigned.
