net: dsa: sja1105: fix ucast/bcast flooding always remaining enabled

In the blamed patch I managed to introduce a bug while moving code
around: the same logic is applied to the ucast_egress_floods and
bcast_egress_floods variables both on the "if" and the "else" branches.

This is clearly an unintended change compared to how the code used to be
prior to that bugfix, so restore it.
