ARM: 9069/1: NOMMU: Fix conversion for_each_membock() to for_each_mem_range()

for_each_mem_range() uses a loop variable, yet looking into code it is
not just iteration counter but more complex entity which encodes
information about memblock. Thus condition i == 0 looks fragile.
Indeed, it broke boot of R-class platforms since it never took i == 0
path (due to i was set to 1). Fix that with restoring original flag
check.
