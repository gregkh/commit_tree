net: phy: icplus: call phy_restore_page() when phy_select_page() fails

The comments to phy_select_page() say that "phy_restore_page() must
always be called after this, irrespective of success or failure of this
call."  If we don't call phy_restore_page() then we are still holding
the phy_lock_mdio_bus() so it eventually leads to a dead lock.
