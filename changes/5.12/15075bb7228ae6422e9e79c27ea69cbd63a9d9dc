selftests/bpf: Fix a compiler warning in local_storage test

Some compilers trigger a warning when tmp_dir_path is allocated
with a fixed size of 64-bytes and used in the following snprintf:

  snprintf(tmp_exec_path, sizeof(tmp_exec_path), "%s/copy_of_rm",
	   tmp_dir_path);

  warning: ‘/copy_of_rm’ directive output may be truncated writing 11
  bytes into a region of size between 1 and 64 [-Wformat-truncation=]

This is because it assumes that tmp_dir_path can be a maximum of 64
bytes long and, therefore, the end-result can get truncated. Fix it by
not using a fixed size in the initialization of tmp_dir_path which
allows the compiler to track actual size of the array better.
