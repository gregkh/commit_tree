regulator: bd9571mwv: Fix regulator name printed on registration failure

If a regulator fails to register, the driver prints an error message
like:

    bd9571mwv-regulator bd9571mwv-regulator.6.auto: failed to register bd9571mwv-regulator regulator

However, the platform device's name is already printed as part of
dev_err(), and does not allow the user to distinguish among the various
regulators that are part of the PMIC.

Fix this by printing regulator_desc.name instead, to change the message
like:

    bd9571mwv-regulator bd9571mwv-regulator.6.auto: failed to register DVFS regulator
