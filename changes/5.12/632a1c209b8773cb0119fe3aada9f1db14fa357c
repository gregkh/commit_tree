x86/traps: Correct exc_general_protection() and math_error() return paths

Commit

  334872a09198 ("x86/traps: Attempt to fixup exceptions in vDSO before signaling")

added return statements which bypass calling cond_local_irq_disable().

According to

  ca4c6a9858c2 ("x86/traps: Make interrupt enable/disable symmetric in C code"),

cond_local_irq_disable() is needed because the asm return code no longer
disables interrupts. Follow the existing code as an example to use "goto
exit" instead of "return" statement.
