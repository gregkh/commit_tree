KVM: x86/mmu: Set SPTE_AD_WRPROT_ONLY_MASK if and only if PML is enabled

Check that PML is actually enabled before setting the mask to force a
SPTE to be write-protected.  The bits used for the !AD_ENABLED case are
in the upper half of the SPTE.  With 64-bit paging and EPT, these bits
are ignored, but with 32-bit PAE paging they are reserved.  Setting them
for L2 SPTEs without checking PML breaks NPT on 32-bit KVM.
