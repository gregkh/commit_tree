net: hns3: cleanup for endian issue for VF RSS

Currently the RSS commands of VF are using host byte order.
According to the user manual, it should use little endian in
the command to firmware. For the host and firmware are both
using little endian, so it can work well in this case.

Do cleanup to make it more explicitly.
