perf daemon: Force waipid for all session on SIGCHLD delivery

If we don't process SIGCHLD before another comes, we will see just one
SIGCHLD as a result. In this case current code will miss exit
notification for a session and wait forever.

Adding extra waitpid check for all sessions when SIGCHLD is received, to
make sure we don't miss any session exit.

Also fix close condition for signal_fd.
