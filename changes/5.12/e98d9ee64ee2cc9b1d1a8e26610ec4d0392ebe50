can: m_can: m_can_rx_peripheral(): fix RX being blocked by errors

For M_CAN peripherals, m_can_rx_handler() was called with quota = 1,
which caused any error handling to block RX from taking place until
the next time the IRQ handler is called. This had been observed to
cause RX to be blocked indefinitely in some cases.

This is fixed by calling m_can_rx_handler with a sensibly high quota.
