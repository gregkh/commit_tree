dmaengine: xilinx: dpdma: Fix descriptor issuing on video group

When multiple channels are part of a video group, the transfer is
triggered only when all channels in the group are ready. The logic to do
so is incorrect, as it causes the descriptors for all channels but the
last one in a group to not being pushed to the hardware. Fix it.
