EDAC/amd64: Do not load on family 0x15, model 0x13

Those were only laptops and are very very unlikely to have ECC memory.
Currently, when the driver attempts to load, it issues:

  EDAC amd64: Error: F1 not found: device 0x1601 (broken BIOS?)

because the PCI device is the wrong one (it uses the F15h default one).

So do not load the driver on them as that is pointless.
