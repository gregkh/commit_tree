net/mlx5e: E-Switch, Offload all chain 0 priorities when modify header and forward action is not supported

Miss path handling of tc multi chain filters (i.e. filters that are
defined on chain > 0) requires the hardware to communicate to the
driver the last chain that was processed. This is possible only when
the hardware is capable of performing the combination of modify header
and forward to table actions. Currently, if the hardware is missing
this capability then the driver only offloads rules that are defined
on tc chain 0 prio 1. However, this restriction can be relaxed because
packets that miss from chain 0 are processed through all the
priorities by tc software.

Allow the offload of all the supported priorities for chain 0 even
when the hardware is not capable to perform modify header and goto
table actions.
