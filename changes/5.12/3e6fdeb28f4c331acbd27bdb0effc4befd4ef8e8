net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: Let GSWIP automatically set the xMII clock

The xMII interface clock depends on the PHY interface (MII, RMII, RGMII)
as well as the current link speed. Explicitly configure the GSWIP to
automatically select the appropriate xMII interface clock.

This fixes an issue seen by some users where ports using an external
RMII or RGMII PHY were deaf (no RX or TX traffic could be seen). Most
likely this is due to an "invalid" xMII clock being selected either by
the bootloader or hardware-defaults.
