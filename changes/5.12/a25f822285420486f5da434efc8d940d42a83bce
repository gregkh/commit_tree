flow_dissector: fix byteorder of dissected ICMP ID

flow_dissector_key_icmp::id is of type u16 (CPU byteorder),
ICMP header has its ID field in network byteorder obviously.
Sparse says:

net/core/flow_dissector.c:178:43: warning: restricted __be16 degrades to integer

Convert ID value to CPU byteorder when storing it into
flow_dissector_key_icmp.
