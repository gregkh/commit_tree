bpf: bpf_fib_lookup return MTU value as output when looked up

The BPF-helpers for FIB lookup (bpf_xdp_fib_lookup and bpf_skb_fib_lookup)
can perform MTU check and return BPF_FIB_LKUP_RET_FRAG_NEEDED. The BPF-prog
don't know the MTU value that caused this rejection.

If the BPF-prog wants to implement PMTU (Path MTU Discovery) (rfc1191) it
need to know this MTU value for the ICMP packet.

Patch change lookup and result struct bpf_fib_lookup, to contain this MTU
value as output via a union with 'tot_len' as this is the value used for
the MTU lookup.

V5:
 - Fixed uninit value spotted by Dan Carpenter.
 - Name struct output member mtu_result
