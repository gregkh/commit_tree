RDMA/umem: Support importing dma-buf as user memory region

Dma-buf is a standard cross-driver buffer sharing mechanism that can be
used to support peer-to-peer access from RDMA devices.

Device memory exported via dma-buf is associated with a file descriptor.
This is passed to the user space as a property associated with the buffer
allocation. When the buffer is registered as a memory region, the file
descriptor is passed to the RDMA driver along with other parameters.

Implement the common code for importing dma-buf object and mapping dma-buf
pages.
