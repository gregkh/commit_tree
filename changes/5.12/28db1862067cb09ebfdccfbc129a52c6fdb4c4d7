iwlwifi: mvm: assign SAR table revision to the command later

The call to iwl_sar_geo_init() was moved to the end of the
iwl_mvm_sar_geo_init() function, after the table revision is assigned
to the FW command.  But the revision is only known after
iwl_sar_geo_init() is called, so we were always assigning zero to it.

Fix that by moving the assignment code after the iwl_sar_geo_init()
function is called.
