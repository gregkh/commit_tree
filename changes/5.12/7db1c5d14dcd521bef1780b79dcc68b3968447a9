btrfs: zoned: support dev-replace in zoned filesystems

This is 4/4 patch to implement device-replace on zoned filesystems.

Even after the copying is done, the write pointers of the source device
and the destination device may not be synchronized. For example, when
the last allocated extent is freed before device-replace process, the
extent is not copied, leaving a hole there.

Synchronize the write pointers by writing zeroes to the destination
device.
