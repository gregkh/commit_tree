uio: uio_pci_generic: don't fail probe if pdev->irq equals to IRQ_NOTCONNECTED

Some devices use 255 as default value of Interrupt Line register, and this
maybe causes pdev->irq is set as IRQ_NOTCONNECTED in some scenarios. For
example, NVMe controller connects to Intel Volume Management Device (VMD).
In this situation, IRQ_NOTCONNECTED means INTx line is not connected, not
fault. If bind uio_pci_generic to these devices, uio frame will return
-ENOTCONN through request_irq.

This patch allows binding uio_pci_generic to device with dev->irq of
IRQ_NOTCONNECTED.
