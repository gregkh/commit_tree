rcu: Record kvfree_call_rcu() call stack for KASAN

This commit adds a call to kasan_record_aux_stack() in kvfree_call_rcu()
in order to record the call stack of the code that caused the object
to be freed.  Please note that this function does not update the
allocated/freed state, which is important because RCU readers might
still be referencing this object.
