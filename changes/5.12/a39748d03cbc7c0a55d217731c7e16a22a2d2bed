ASoC: soc-pcm: cleanup soc_pcm_apply_symmetry()

soc_pcm_apply_symmetry() want to call snd_pcm_hw_constraint_single()
for rate/channel/sample_bits, but, it needs many condition check.
These are very similar but different, thus, it needs to have very
verbose code.
This patch use macro for it and make code more simple.
