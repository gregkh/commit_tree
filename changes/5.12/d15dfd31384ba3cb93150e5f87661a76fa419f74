arm64: mte: Map hotplugged memory as Normal Tagged

In a system supporting MTE, the linear map must allow reading/writing
allocation tags by setting the memory type as Normal Tagged. Currently,
this is only handled for memory present at boot. Hotplugged memory uses
Normal non-Tagged memory.

Introduce pgprot_mhp() for hotplugged memory and use it in
add_memory_resource(). The arm64 code maps pgprot_mhp() to
pgprot_tagged().

Note that ZONE_DEVICE memory should not be mapped as Tagged and
therefore setting the memory type in arch_add_memory() is not feasible.
