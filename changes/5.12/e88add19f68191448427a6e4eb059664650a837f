net: xfrm: Localize sequence counter per network namespace

A sequence counter write section must be serialized or its internal
state can get corrupted. The "xfrm_state_hash_generation" seqcount is
global, but its write serialization lock (net->xfrm.xfrm_state_lock) is
instantiated per network namespace. The write protection is thus
insufficient.

To provide full protection, localize the sequence counter per network
namespace instead. This should be safe as both the seqcount read and
write sections access data exclusively within the network namespace. It
also lays the foundation for transforming "xfrm_state_hash_generation"
data type from seqcount_t to seqcount_LOCKNAME_t in further commits.
