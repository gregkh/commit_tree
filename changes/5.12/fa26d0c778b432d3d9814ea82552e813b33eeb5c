ACPI: processor: Fix build when CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=m

Commit 8cdddd182bd7 ("ACPI: processor: Fix CPU0 wakeup in
acpi_idle_play_dead()") tried to fix CPU0 hotplug breakage by copying
wakeup_cpu0() + start_cpu0() logic from hlt_play_dead()//mwait_play_dead()
into acpi_idle_play_dead(). The problem is that these functions are not
exported to modules so when CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=m build fails.

The issue could've been fixed by exporting both wakeup_cpu0()/start_cpu0()
(the later from assembly) but it seems putting the whole pattern into a
new function and exporting it instead is better.
