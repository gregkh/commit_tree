drm: Set vm_ops to GEM object's values during mmap

The GEM mmap code relies on the GEM object's mmap callback to set the
VMA's vm_ops field. This is easily forgotten and already led to a memory
leak in the CMA helpers. Instead set the vm_ops field in the DRM core
code to the GEM object's value. Drivers with different needs can override
this in their mmap callback.

v2:
	* support (vm_ops == NULL) if mmap is given; required by VRAM
	  helpers
