drm/amd/pm: modify the fine grain tuning function for Renoir

This patch is to modify the fine grain tuning function for Renoir.
The fine grain tuning function uses the sysfs node -- pp_od_clk_voltage
to config gfxclk. Meanwhile, another sysfs
node -- power_dpm_force_perfomance_level also affects the gfx clk.
It will cause confusion when these two sysfs nodes works
together.
It is risky to add two new flags to common smu struct, so
this patch uses the existing flag to make these two sysfs nodes works
separately. Only when power_dpm_force_perfomance_level is changed
to "manual" mode, the fine grain function will be started.
In other profile modes, including "auto", "high", "low", "profile_peak",
"profile_standard", "profile_min_sclk", "profile_min_mclk",
the fine grain tuning function will be shut down and the frequency range
of gfx will be restored the default value.
