kgdb: Remove kgdb_schedule_breakpoint()

To the very best of my knowledge there has never been any in-tree
code that calls this function. It exists largely to support an
out-of-tree driver that provides kgdb-over-ethernet using the
netpoll API.

kgdboe has been out-of-tree for more than 10 years and I don't
recall any serious attempt to upstream it at any point in the last
five. At this stage it looks better to stop carrying this code in
the kernel and integrate the code into the out-of-tree driver
instead.

The long term trajectory for the kernel looks likely to include
effort to remove or reduce the use of tasklets (something that has
also been true for the last 10 years). Thus the main real reason
for this patch is to make explicit that the in-tree kgdb features
do not require tasklets.
