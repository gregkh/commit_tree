cxl/mem: Do not rely on device_add() side effects for dev_set_name() failures

While device_add() will happen to catch dev_set_name() failures it is a
broken pattern to follow given that the core may try to fall back to a
different name.

Add explicit checking for dev_set_name() failures to be cleaned up by
put_device(). Skip cdev_device_add() and proceed directly to
put_device() if the name set fails.

This type of bug is easier to see if 'alloc' is split from 'add'
operations that require put_device() on failure. So cxl_memdev_alloc()
is split out as a result.
