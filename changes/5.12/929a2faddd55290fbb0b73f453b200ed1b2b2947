net/mlx5e: Consider geneve_opts for encap contexts

Current algorithm for encap keys is legacy from initial vxlan
implementation and doesn't take into account all possible fields of a
tunnel. For example, for a Geneve tunnel, which may have additional TLV
options, they are ignored when comparing encap keys and a rule can be
attached to an incorrect encap entry.

Fix that by introducing encap_info_equal() operation in
struct mlx5e_tc_tunnel. Geneve tunnel type uses custom implementation,
which extends generic algorithm and considers options if they are set.
