mm: eliminate "expecting prototype" kernel-doc warnings

Fix stray kernel-doc warnings in mm/ due to mis-typed or missing function

Quietens these kernel-doc warnings:

  mm/mmu_gather.c:264: warning: expecting prototype for tlb_gather_mmu(). Prototype was for __tlb_gather_mmu() instead
  mm/oom_kill.c:180: warning: expecting prototype for Check whether unreclaimable slab amount is greater than(). Prototype was for should_dump_unreclaim_slab() instead
  mm/shuffle.c:155: warning: expecting prototype for shuffle_free_memory(). Prototype was for __shuffle_free_memory() instead
