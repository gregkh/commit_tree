octeontx2-af: cn10k: Update NIX/NPA context structure

NIX hardware context structure got changed to accommodate new
features like bandwidth steering, L3/L4 outer/inner checksum
enable/disable etc., on CN10K platform.
This patch defines new mbox message NIX_CN10K_AQ_INST for new
NIX context initialization.

This patch also updates the NPA context structures to accommodate
bit field changes made for CN10K platform.

This patch also removes Big endian bit fields from existing
structures as its support got deprecated in current and upcoming silicons.
