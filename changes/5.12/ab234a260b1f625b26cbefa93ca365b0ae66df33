x86/pv: Rework arch_local_irq_restore() to not use popf

POPF is a rather expensive operation, so don't use it for restoring
irq flags. Instead, test whether interrupts are enabled in the flags
parameter and enable interrupts via STI in that case.

This results in the restore_fl paravirt op to be no longer needed.
