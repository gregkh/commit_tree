io_uring: don't leak creds on SQO attach error

Attaching to already dead/dying SQPOLL task is disallowed in
io_sq_offload_create(), but cleanup is hand coded by calling
io_put_sq_data()/etc., that miss to put ctx->sq_creds.

Defer everything to error-path io_sq_thread_finish(), adding
ctx->sqd_list in the error case as well as finish will handle it.
