srcu: Make Tiny SRCU use multi-bit grace-period counter

There is a need for a polling interface for SRCU grace periods.  This
polling needs to distinguish between an SRCU instance being idle on the
one hand or in the middle of a grace period on the other.  This commit
therefore converts the Tiny SRCU srcu_struct structure's srcu_idx from
a defacto boolean to a free-running counter, using the bottom bit to
indicate that a grace period is in progress.  The second-from-bottom
bit is thus used as the index returned by srcu_read_lock().
