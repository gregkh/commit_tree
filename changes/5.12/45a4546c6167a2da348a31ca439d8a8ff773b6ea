cifs: Adjust key sizes and key generation routines for AES256 encryption

For AES256 encryption (GCM and CCM), we need to adjust the size of a few
fields to 32 bytes instead of 16 to accommodate the larger keys.

Also, the L value supplied to the key generator needs to be changed from
to 256 when these algorithms are used.

Keeping the ioctl struct for dumping keys of the same size for now.
Will send out a different patch for that one.
