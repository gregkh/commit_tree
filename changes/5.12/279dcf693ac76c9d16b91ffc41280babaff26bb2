virt: acrn: Introduce an interface for Service VM to control vCPU

ACRN supports partition mode to achieve real-time requirements. In
partition mode, a CPU core can be dedicated to a vCPU of User VM. The
local APIC of the dedicated CPU core can be passthrough to the User VM.
The Service VM controls the assignment of the CPU cores.

Introduce an interface for the Service VM to remove the control of CPU
core from hypervisor perspective so that the CPU core can be a dedicated
CPU core of User VM.
