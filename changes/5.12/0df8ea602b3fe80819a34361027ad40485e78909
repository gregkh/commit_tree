io_uring: remove useless ->startup completion

We always do complete(&sqd->startup) almost right after sqd->thread
creation, either in the success path or in io_sq_thread_finish(). It's
specifically created not started for us to be able to set some stuff
like sqd->thread and io_uring_alloc_task_context() before following
right after wake_up_new_task().
