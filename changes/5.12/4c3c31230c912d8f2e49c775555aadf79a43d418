arm64: kexec: move relocation function setup

Currently, kernel relocation function is configured in machine_kexec()
at the time of kexec reboot by using control_code_page.

This operation, however, is more logical to be done during kexec_load,
and thus remove from reboot time. Move, setup of this function to
newly added machine_kexec_post_load().

Because once MMU is enabled, kexec control page will contain more than
relocation kernel, but also vector table, add pointer to the actual
function within this page arch.kern_reloc. Currently, it equals to the
beginning of page, we will add offsets later, when vector table is
added.
