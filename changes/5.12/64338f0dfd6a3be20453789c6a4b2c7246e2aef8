rtlwifi: rtl8188ee: fix bool comparison in expressions

There are certain conditional expressions in rtl8188ee, where a boolean
variable is compared with true/false, in forms such as (foo == true) or
(false != bar), which does not comply with checkpatch.pl (CHECK:
BOOL_COMPARISON), according to which boolean variables should be
themselves used in the condition, rather than comparing with true/false

E.g., in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8188ee/dm.c,
"if (mac->act_scanning == true)" can be replaced with
"if (mac->act_scanning)"

Replace all such expressions with the bool variables appropriately
