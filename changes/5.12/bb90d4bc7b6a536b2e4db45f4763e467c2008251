mm/highmem: Lift memcpy_[to|from]_page to core

Working through a conversion to a call kmap_local_page() instead of
kmap() revealed many places where the pattern kmap/memcpy/kunmap
occurred.

Eric Biggers, Matthew Wilcox, Christoph Hellwig, Dan Williams, and Al
Viro all suggested putting this code into helper functions.  Al Viro
further pointed out that these functions already existed in the iov_iter
code.[1]

Various locations for the lifted functions were considered.

Headers like mm.h or string.h seem ok but don't really portray the
functionality well.  pagemap.h made some sense but is for page cache
functionality.[2]

Another alternative would be to create a new header for the promoted
memcpy functions, but it masks the fact that these are designed to copy
to/from pages using the kernel direct mappings and complicates matters
with a new header.

Placing these functions in 'highmem.h' is suboptimal especially with the
changes being proposed in the functionality of kmap.  From a caller
perspective including/using 'highmem.h' implies that the functions
defined in that header are only required when highmem is in use which is
increasingly not the case with modern processors.  However, highmem.h is
where all the current functions like this reside (zero_user(),
clear_highpage(), clear_user_highpage(), copy_user_highpage(), and
copy_highpage()).  So it makes the most sense even though it is
distasteful for some.[3]

Lift memcpy_to_page() and memcpy_from_page() to pagemap.h.
