bpf: Take module reference for trampoline in module

Currently module can be unloaded even if there's a trampoline
register in it. It's easily reproduced by running in parallel:

  # while :; do ./test_progs -t module_attach; done
  # while :; do rmmod bpf_testmod; sleep 0.5; done

Taking the module reference in case the trampoline's ip is
within the module code. Releasing it when the trampoline's
ip is unregistered.
