perf inject: Fix repipe usage

Since commit 14d3d54052539a1e ("perf session: Try to read pipe data from
file") 'perf inject' has started printing "PERFILE2h" when not processing
pipes.

The commit exposed perf to the possiblity that the input is not a pipe
but the 'repipe' parameter gets used. That causes the printing because
perf inject sets 'repipe' to true always.

The 'repipe' parameter of perf_session__new() is used by 2 functions:

	- perf_file_header__read_pipe()
	- trace_report()

In both cases, the functions copy data to STDOUT_FILENO when 'repipe' is
true.

Fix by setting 'repipe' to true only if the output is a pipe.
