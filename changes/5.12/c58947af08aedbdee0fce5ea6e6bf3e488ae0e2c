ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirk for the Acer One S1002 tablet

The Acer One S1002 tablet is using an analog mic on IN1 and has
its jack-detect connected to JD2_IN4N, instead of using the default
IN3 for its internal mic and JD1_IN4P for jack-detect.

Note it is also using AIF2 instead of AIF1 which is somewhat unusual,
this is correctly advertised in the ACPI CHAN package, so the speakers
do work without the quirk.

Add a quirk for the mic and jack-detect settings.
