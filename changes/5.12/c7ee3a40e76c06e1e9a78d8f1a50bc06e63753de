dt-bindings: net: convert Broadcom Starfighter 2 binding to the json-schema

This helps validating DTS files. Only the current (not deprecated one)
binding was converted.

Minor changes:
1. Dropped dsa/dsa.txt references
2. Updated node name to match dsa.yaml requirement
3. Fixed 2 typos in examples

The new binding was validated using the dt_binding_check.
