ASoC: rt5670: Remove ADC vol-ctrl mute bits poking from Sto1 ADC mixer settings

The SND_SOC_DAPM_MIXER declaration for "Sto1 ADC MIXL" and "Sto1 ADC MIXR"
was using the mute bits from the RT5670_STO1_ADC_DIG_VOL control as mixer
master mute bits.

But these bits are already exposed to userspace as controls as part of the
"ADC Capture Volume" / "ADC Capture Switch" control pair:

        SOC_DOUBLE("ADC Capture Switch", RT5670_STO1_ADC_DIG_VOL,
                RT5670_L_MUTE_SFT, RT5670_R_MUTE_SFT, 1, 1),
        SOC_DOUBLE_TLV("ADC Capture Volume", RT5670_STO1_ADC_DIG_VOL,
                        RT5670_L_VOL_SFT, RT5670_R_VOL_SFT,
                        127, 0, adc_vol_tlv),

Both the fact that the mute bits belong to the same reg as the vol-ctrl
and the "Digital Mixer Path" diagram in the datasheet clearly shows that
these mute bits are not part of the mixer and having 2 separate controls
poking at the same bits is a bad idea.

Remove the master-mute bits settings from the  "Sto1 ADC MIXL" and
"Sto1 ADC MIXR" DAPM widget declarations, avoiding these bits getting
poked from 2 different places.

This should not cause any issues for userspace. AFAICT the rt567x codecs
are only used on x86/ACPI devices and the UCM profiles used there already
set the "ADC Capture Switch" as needed.
