net: dsa: Fix type was not set for devlink port

If PHY is not available on DSA port (described at devicetree but absent or
failed to detect) then kernel prints warning after 3700 secs:

[ 3707.948771] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[ 3707.948784] Type was not set for devlink port.
[ 3707.948894] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 17 at net/core/devlink.c:8097 0xc083f9d8

We should unregister the devlink port as a user port and
re-register it as an unused port before executing "continue" in case of
dsa_port_setup error.
