x86/sgx: Drop racy follow_pfn() check

PTE insertion is fundamentally racy, and this check doesn't do anything
useful. Quoting Sean:

  "Yeah, it can be whacked. The original, never-upstreamed code asserted
  that the resolved PFN matched the PFN being installed by the fault
  handler as a sanity check on the SGX driver's EPC management. The
  WARN assertion got dropped for whatever reason, leaving that useless
  chunk."

Jason stumbled over this as a new user of follow_pfn(), and I'm trying
to get rid of unsafe callers of that function so it can be locked down
further.

This is independent prep work for the referenced patch series:
