Input: applespi - don't wait for responses to commands indefinitely.

The response to a command may never arrive or it may be corrupted (and
hence dropped) for some reason. While exceedingly rare, when it did
happen it blocked all further commands. One way to fix this was to
do a suspend/resume. However, recovering automatically seems like a
nicer option. Hence this puts a time limit (1 sec) on how long we're
willing to wait for a response, after which we assume it got lost.
