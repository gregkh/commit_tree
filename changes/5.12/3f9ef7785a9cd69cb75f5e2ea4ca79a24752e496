MIPS: ralink: manage low reset lines

Reset lines with indices smaller than 8 are currently considered invalid
by the rt2880-reset reset controller.

The MT7621 SoC uses a number of these low reset lines. The DTS defines
reset lines "hsdma", "fe", and "mcm" with respective values 5, 6, and 2.
As a result of the above restriction, these resets cannot be asserted or
de-asserted by the reset controller. In cases where the bootloader does
not de-assert these lines, this results in e.g. the MT7621's internal
switch staying in reset.

Change the reset controller to only ignore the system reset, so all
reset lines with index greater than 0 are considered valid.
