ACPI: CPPC: remove __iomem annotation for cpc_reg's address

The cpc_reg address does not represent either an I/O virtual address,
nor a field located in iomem. This address is used as an address offset
which eventually is given as physical address argument to ioremap or PCC
space offset to GET_PCC_VADDR. Therefore, having the __iomem annotation
does not make sense.

Fix the following sparse warnings by removing the __iomem annotation
for cpc_reg's address.
