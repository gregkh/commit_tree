drm/omap: dsi: Reverse direction of the DSS device enable/disable operations

Complete the direction reversal of the DSS device enable/disable
operations started by commit 19b4200d8f4b ("drm/omap: Reverse direction
of the DSS device enable/disable operations").

This effectively drops the requirement of calling DSS specific
code from the DSI panel driver moving it a bit further to a
standard drm_panel driver.
