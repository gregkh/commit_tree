staging: vt665x: fix alignment constraints

Removing 2 instances of alignment warnings

drivers/staging/vt6655/rxtx.h:153:1: warning: alignment 1 of ‘struct vnt_cts’ is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]
drivers/staging/vt6655/rxtx.h:163:1: warning: alignment 1 of ‘struct vnt_cts_fb’ is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

The root cause seems to be that _because_ struct ieee80211_cts is marked as __aligned(2),
this requires any encapsulating struct to also have an alignment of 2.
