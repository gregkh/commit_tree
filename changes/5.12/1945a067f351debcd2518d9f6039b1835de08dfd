arm64: Make kvm-arm.mode={nvhe, protected} an alias of id_aa64mmfr1.vh=0

Admitedly, passing id_aa64mmfr1.vh=0 on the command-line isn't
that easy to understand, and it is likely that users would much
prefer write "kvm-arm.mode=nvhe", or "...=protected".

So here you go. This has the added advantage that we can now
always honor the "kvm-arm.mode=protected" option, even when
booting on a VHE system.
