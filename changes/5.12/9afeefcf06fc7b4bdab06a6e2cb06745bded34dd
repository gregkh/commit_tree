remoteproc: pru: Fix firmware loading crashes on K3 SoCs

The K3 PRUs are 32-bit processors and in general have some limitations
in using the standard ARMv8 memcpy function for loading firmware segments,
so the driver already uses a custom memcpy implementation. This added
logic however is limited to only IRAMs at the moment, but the loading
into Data RAMs is not completely ok either and does generate a kernel
crash for unaligned accesses.

Fix these crashes by removing the existing IRAM logic limitation and
extending the custom memcpy usage to Data RAMs as well for all K3 SoCs.
