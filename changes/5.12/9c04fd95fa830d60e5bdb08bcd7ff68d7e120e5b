iwlwifi: fw: fix notification wait locking

Since we now call iwl_notification_wait_notify() from the
NAPI poll in soft-IRQ, we get a (valid) lockdep complaint
that we could get a deadlock by taking the spinlock from
sleeping context and then getting the soft-IRQ that also
tries to take it (in NAPI polling).

Fix this by disabling soft-IRQs for this lock.
