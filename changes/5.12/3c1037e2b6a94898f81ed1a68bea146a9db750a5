USB: usbtmc: Fix reading stale status byte

The ioctl USBTMC488_IOCTL_READ_STB either returns a cached status byte
(STB) sent by the device due to a service request (SRQ) condition or
the STB obtained from a query to the device with a READ_STATUS_BYTE
control message.

When the query is interrupted by an SRQ message on the interrupt pipe,
the ioctl still returns the requested STB while the STB of the
out-of-band SRQ message is cached for the next call of this
ioctl. However the cached SRQ STB represents a state that was previous
to the last returned STB.  Furthermore the cached SRQ STB can be stale
and not reflect the current state of the device.

The fixed ioctl now always reads the STB from the device and if the
associated file descriptor has the srq_asserted bit set it ors in the
RQS bit to the returned STB and clears the srq_asserted bit conformant
to subclass USB488 devices.
