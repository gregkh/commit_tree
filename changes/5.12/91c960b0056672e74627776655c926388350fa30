bpf: Rename BPF_XADD and prepare to encode other atomics in .imm

A subsequent patch will add additional atomic operations. These new
operations will use the same opcode field as the existing XADD, with
the immediate discriminating different operations.

In preparation, rename the instruction mode BPF_ATOMIC and start
calling the zero immediate BPF_ADD.

This is possible (doesn't break existing valid BPF progs) because the
immediate field is currently reserved MBZ and BPF_ADD is zero.

All uses are removed from the tree but the BPF_XADD definition is
kept around to avoid breaking builds for people including kernel
headers.
