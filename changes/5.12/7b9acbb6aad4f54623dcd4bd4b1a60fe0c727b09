xtensa: fix uaccess-related livelock in do_page_fault

If a uaccess (e.g. get_user()) triggers a fault and there's a
fault signal pending, the handler will return to the uaccess without
having performed a uaccess fault fixup, and so the CPU will immediately
execute the uaccess instruction again, whereupon it will livelock
bouncing between that instruction and the fault handler.
