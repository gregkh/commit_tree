x86/fault: Fix AMD erratum #91 errata fixup for user code

The recent rework of probe_kernel_address() and its conversion to
get_kernel_nofault() inadvertently broke is_prefetch(). Before this
change, probe_kernel_address() was used as a sloppy "read user or
kernel memory" helper, but it doesn't do that any more. The new
get_kernel_nofault() reads *kernel* memory only, which completely broke
is_prefetch() for user access.

Adjust the code to the correct accessor based on access mode. The
manual address bounds check is no longer necessary, since the accessor
helpers (get_user() / get_kernel_nofault()) do the right thing all by
themselves. As a bonus, by using the correct accessor, the open-coded
address bounds check is not needed anymore.
