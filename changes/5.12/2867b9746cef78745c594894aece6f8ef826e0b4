clk: socfpga: fix iomem pointer cast on 64-bit

Pointers should be cast with uintptr_t instead of integer.  This fixes
warning when compile testing on ARM64:

  drivers/clk/socfpga/clk-gate.c: In function ‘socfpga_clk_recalc_rate’:
  drivers/clk/socfpga/clk-gate.c:102:7: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
