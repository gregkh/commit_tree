arm64: fix inline asm in load_unaligned_zeropad()

The inline asm's addr operand is marked as input-only, however in
the case where an exception is taken it may be modified by the BIC
instruction on the exception path. Fix the problem by using a temporary
register as the destination register for the BIC instruction.
