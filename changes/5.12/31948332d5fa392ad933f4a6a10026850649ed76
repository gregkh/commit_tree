KVM: arm64: Avoid corrupting vCPU context register in guest exit

Commit 7db21530479f ("KVM: arm64: Restore hyp when panicking in guest
context") tracks the currently running vCPU, clearing the pointer to
NULL on exit from a guest.

Unfortunately, the use of 'set_loaded_vcpu' clobbers x1 to point at the
kvm_hyp_ctxt instead of the vCPU context, causing the subsequent RAS
code to go off into the weeds when it saves the DISR assuming that the
CPU context is embedded in a struct vCPU.

Leave x1 alone and use x3 as a temporary register instead when clearing
the vCPU on the guest exit path.
