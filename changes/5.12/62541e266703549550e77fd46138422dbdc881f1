iwlwifi: pcie: fix iwl_so_trans_cfg link error when CONFIG_IWLMVM is disabled

Randy reported an error on his randconfig builds:

ERROR: modpost: "iwl_so_trans_cfg" [drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.ko] undefined!

The problem was that when CONFIG_IWLMVM was disabled we were still accessing
iwl_so_trans_cfg. Fix it by moving IS_ENABLED() check before the access.
