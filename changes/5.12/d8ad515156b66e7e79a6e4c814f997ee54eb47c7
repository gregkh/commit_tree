virt: acrn: Introduce ioeventfd

ioeventfd is a mechanism to register PIO/MMIO regions to trigger an
eventfd signal when written to by a User VM. ACRN userspace can register
any arbitrary I/O address with a corresponding eventfd and then pass the
eventfd to a specific end-point of interest for handling.

Vhost is a kernel-level virtio server which uses eventfd for signalling.
To support vhost on ACRN, ioeventfd is introduced in HSM.

A new I/O client dedicated to ioeventfd is associated with a User VM
during VM creation. HSM provides ioctls to associate an I/O region with
a eventfd. The I/O client signals a eventfd once its corresponding I/O
region is matched with an I/O request.
