arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: beelink-gs1: Remove ext. 32 kHz osc reference

Although every Beelink GS1 seems to have external 32768 Hz oscillator,
it works only on one from four tested. There are more reports of RTC
issues elsewhere, like Armbian forum.

One Beelink GS1 owner read RTC osc status register on Android which
shipped with the box. Reported value indicated problems with external
oscillator.

In order to fix RTC and related issues (HDMI-CEC and suspend/resume with
Crust) on all boards, switch to internal oscillator.
