mm/memory_hotplug: rename all existing 'memhp' into 'mhp'

This renames all 'memhp' instances to 'mhp' except for memhp_default_state
for being a kernel command line option.  This is just a clean up and
should not cause a functional change.  Let's make it consistent rater than
mixing the two prefixes.  In preparation for more users of the 'mhp'
terminology.
