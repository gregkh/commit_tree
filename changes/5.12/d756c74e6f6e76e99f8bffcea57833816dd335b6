doc: Update RCU requirements RCU_INIT_POINTER() description

Back in the day, RCU_INIT_POINTER() was the only way to avoid
memory-barrier instructions while storing NULL to an RCU-protected
pointer.  Fortunately, in 2016, rcu_assign_pointer() started checking for
compile-time NULL pointers and omitting the memory-barrier instructions in
that case.  Unfortunately, RCU's Requirements.rst document was not updated
accordingly.  This commit therefore at long last carries out that update.
