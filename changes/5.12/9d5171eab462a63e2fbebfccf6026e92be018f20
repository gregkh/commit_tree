KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal

The original patch 8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal
and unseal operations") was correct on the mailing list:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/

But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in
tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the
TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.

This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()
