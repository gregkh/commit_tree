net: dsa: Fix off by one in dsa_loop_port_vlan_add()

The > comparison is intended to be >= to prevent reading beyond the
end of the ps->vlans[] array.  It doesn't affect run time though because
the ps->vlans[] array has VLAN_N_VID (4096) elements and the vlan->vid
cannot be > 4094 because it is checked earlier.
