bus: fsl-mc: add fsl-mc userspace support

Adding userspace support for the MC (Management Complex) means exporting
an ioctl capable device file representing the root resource container.

This new functionality in the fsl-mc bus driver intends to provide
userspace applications an interface to interact with the MC firmware.

Commands that are composed in userspace are sent to the MC firmware
through the FSL_MC_SEND_MC_COMMAND ioctl.  By default the implicit MC
I/O portal is used for this operation, but if the implicit one is busy,
a dynamic portal is allocated and then freed upon execution.

The command received through the ioctl interface is checked against a
known whitelist of accepted MC commands. Commands that attempt a change
in hardware configuration will need CAP_NET_ADMIN, while commands used
in debugging do not need it.
