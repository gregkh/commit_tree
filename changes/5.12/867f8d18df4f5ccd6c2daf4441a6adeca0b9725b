ASoC: rt5682: fix getting the wrong device id when the suspend_stress_test

This patch will be the workaround to fix getting the wrong device ID on the rare chance.
It seems like something unstable when the system resumes. e.g. the bus clock
This patch tries to read the device ID to check several times.
After the test, the driver will get the correct device ID the second time.
