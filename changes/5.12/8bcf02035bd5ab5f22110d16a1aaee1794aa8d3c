net: igb: use skb_csum_is_sctp instead of protocol check

Using skb_csum_is_sctp is a easier way to validate it's a SCTP
CRC checksum offload packet, and there is no need to parse the
packet to check its proto field, especially when it's a UDP or
GRE encapped packet.

So this patch also makes igb support SCTP CRC checksum offload
for UDP and GRE encapped packets.
