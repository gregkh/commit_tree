kallsyms: refactor {,module_}kallsyms_on_each_symbol

Require an explicit call to module_kallsyms_on_each_symbol to look
for symbols in modules instead of the call from kallsyms_on_each_symbol,
and acquire module_mutex inside of module_kallsyms_on_each_symbol instead
of leaving that up to the caller.  Note that this slightly changes the
behavior for the livepatch code in that the symbols from vmlinux are not
iterated anymore if objname is set, but that actually is the desired
behavior in this case.
