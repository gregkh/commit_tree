crypto: keembay-ocs-hcu - Add HMAC support

Add HMAC support to the Keem Bay OCS HCU driver, thus making it provide
the following additional transformations:
- hmac(sha256)
- hmac(sha384)
- hmac(sha512)
- hmac(sm3)

The Keem Bay OCS HCU hardware does not allow "context-switch" for HMAC
operations, i.e., it does not support computing a partial HMAC, save its
state and then continue it later. Therefore, full hardware acceleration
is provided only when possible (e.g., when crypto_ahash_digest() is
called); in all other cases hardware acceleration is only partial (OPAD
and IPAD calculation is done in software, while hashing is hardware
accelerated).
