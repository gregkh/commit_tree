RDMA/rtrs-srv: Do not pass a valid pointer to PTR_ERR()

smatch gives the warning:

  drivers/infiniband/ulp/rtrs/rtrs-srv.c:1805 rtrs_rdma_connect() warn: passing zero to 'PTR_ERR'

Which is trying to say smatch has shown that srv is not an error pointer
and thus cannot be passed to PTR_ERR.

The solution is to move the list_add() down after full initilization of
rtrs_srv. To avoid holding the srv_mutex too long, only hold it during the
list operation as suggested by Leon.
