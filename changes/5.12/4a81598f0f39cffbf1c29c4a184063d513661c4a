iwlwifi: pnvm: set the PNVM again if it was already loaded

When the interface goes up, we have already loaded the PNVM during
init, so we don't load it anymore.  But we still need to set the PNVM
values in the context so that the FW can load it again.

Call set_pnvm when the PNVM is already loaded and change the
trans_pcie implementation to accept a second call to set_pnvm when we
have already allocated and, in this case, only set the values without
allocating again.
