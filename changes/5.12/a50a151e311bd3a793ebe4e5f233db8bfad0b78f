net: ipconfig: ic_dev can be NULL in ic_close_devs

ic_close_dev contains a generalization of the logic to not close a
network interface if it's the host port for a DSA switch. This logic is
disguised behind an iteration through the lowers of ic_dev in
ic_close_dev.

When no interface for ipconfig can be found, ic_dev is NULL, and
ic_close_dev:
- dereferences a NULL pointer when assigning selected_dev
- would attempt to search through the lower interfaces of a NULL
  net_device pointer

So we should protect against that case.

The "lower_dev" iterator variable was shortened to "lower" in order to
keep the 80 character limit.
