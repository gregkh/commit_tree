Revert "gcov: clang: fix clang-11+ build"

This reverts commit 04c53de57cb6435738961dace8b1b71d3ecd3c39.

Nathan Chancellor points out that it should not have been merged into
mainline by itself. It was a fix for "gcov: use kvmalloc()", which is
still in -mm/-next. Merging it alone has broken the build.
