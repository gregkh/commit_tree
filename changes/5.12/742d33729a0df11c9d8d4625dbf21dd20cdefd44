mm: Move immutable fields of 'struct vm_fault' into anonymous struct

'struct vm_fault' contains both information about the fault being
serviced alongside mutable fields contributing to the state of the
fault-handling logic. Unfortunately, the distinction between the two is
not clear-cut, and a number of callers end up manipulating the structure
temporarily before restoring it when returning.

Try to clean this up by moving the immutable fault information into an
anonymous struct, which will later be marked as 'const'. Ideally, the
'flags' field would be part of the new structure too, but it seems as
though the ->page_mkwrite() path is not ready for this yet.
