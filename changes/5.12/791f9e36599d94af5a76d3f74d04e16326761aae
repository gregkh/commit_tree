powerpc/vdso: Make sure vdso_wrapper.o is rebuilt everytime vdso.so is rebuilt

Commit bce74491c300 ("powerpc/vdso: fix unnecessary rebuilds of
vgettimeofday.o") moved vdso32_wrapper.o and vdso64_wrapper.o out
of arch/powerpc/kernel/vdso[32/64]/ and removed the dependencies in
the Makefile. This leads to the wrappers not being re-build hence the
kernel embedding the old vdso library.

Add back missing dependencies to ensure vdso32_wrapper.o and vdso64_wrapper.o
are rebuilt when vdso32.so.dbg and vdso64.so.dbg are changed.
