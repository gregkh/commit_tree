iio:common:ms_sensors:ms_sensors_i2c: add support for alternative PROM layout

Currently, only the 112bit PROM with 7 words is supported. However the ms58xx
family also have devices with a 128bit PROM on 8 words. See AN520:
C-CODE EXAMPLE FOR MS56XX, MS57XX (EXCEPT ANALOG SENSOR), AND MS58XX SERIES
PRESSURE SENSORS and the various device datasheets.

The difference is that the CRC is the 4 LSBs of word7 instead of being the
4 MSBs of word0.
