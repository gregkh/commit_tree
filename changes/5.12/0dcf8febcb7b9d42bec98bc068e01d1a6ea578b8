scsi: iscsi: Fix iSCSI cls conn state

In commit 9e67600ed6b8 ("scsi: iscsi: Fix race condition between login and
sync thread") I missed that libiscsi was now setting the iSCSI class state,
and that patch ended up resetting the state during conn stoppage and using
the wrong state value during ep_disconnect. This patch moves the setting of
the class state to the class module and then fixes the two issues above.
