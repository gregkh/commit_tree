RAS/CEC: Correct ce_add_elem()'s returned values

ce_add_elem() uses different return values to signal a result from
adding an element to the collector. Commit in Fixes: broke the case
where the element being added is not found in the array. Correct that.

 [ bp: Rewrite commit message, add kernel-doc comments. ]
