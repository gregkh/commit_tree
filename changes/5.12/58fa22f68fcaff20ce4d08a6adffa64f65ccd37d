mtd: spi-nor: core: Add erase size check for erase command initialization

Even if erase type is same as previous region, erase size can be different
if the previous region is overlaid region. Since 'region->size' is assigned
to 'cmd->size' for overlaid region, comparing 'erase->size' and 'cmd->size'
can detect previous overlaid region.
