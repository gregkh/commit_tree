tools/cgroup/slabinfo.py: updated to work on current kernel

slabinfo.py script does not work with actual kernel version.

First, it was unable to recognise SLUB susbsytem, and when I specified
it manually it failed again with

  AttributeError: 'struct page' has no member 'obj_cgroups'

.. and then again with

  File "tools/cgroup/memcg_slabinfo.py", line 221, in main
    memcg.kmem_caches.address_of_(),
  AttributeError: 'struct mem_cgroup' has no member 'kmem_caches'
