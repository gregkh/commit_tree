block: don't create too many partitions

Commit a33df75c6328 ("block: use an xarray for disk->part_tbl") drops the
check on max supported number of partitionsr, and allows partition with
bigger partition numbers to be added. However, ->bd_partno is defined as
u8, so partition index of xarray table may not match with ->bd_partno.
Then delete_partition() may delete one unmatched partition, and caused
use-after-free.
