media: dt-bindings: Remove old ov5647.yaml file, update ovti,ov5647.yaml

Recently ov5647.yaml got renamed as ovti,ov5647.yaml. As part of the
video-interfaces DT schema conversion that was unintentionally brought
back. Fix this by applying the schema changes to the new file and removing
the old one.
