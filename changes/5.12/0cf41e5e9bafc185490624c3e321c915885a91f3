block/psi: remove PSI annotations from direct IO

Direct IO does not operate on the current working set of pages managed
by the kernel, so it should not be accounted as memory stall to PSI
infrastructure.

The block layer and iomap direct IO use bio_iov_iter_get_pages()
to build bios, and they are the only users of it, so to avoid PSI
tracking for them clear out BIO_WORKINGSET flag. Do same for
dio_bio_submit() because fs/direct_io constructs bios by hand directly
calling bio_add_page().
