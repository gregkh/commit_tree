RDMA/hns: Fix bug during CMDQ initialization

When reloading driver, the head/tail pointer of CMDQ may be not at
position 0. Then during initialization of CMDQ, if head is reset first,
the firmware will start to handle CMDQ because the head is not equal to
the tail. The driver can reset tail first since the firmware will be
triggerred only by head. This bug is introduced by changing macros of
head/tail register without changing the order of initialization.
