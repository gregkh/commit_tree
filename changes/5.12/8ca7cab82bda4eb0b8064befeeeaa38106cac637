dm verity fec: fix misaligned RS roots IO

commit df7b59ba9245 ("dm verity: fix FEC for RS roots unaligned to
block size") introduced the possibility for misaligned roots IO
relative to the underlying device's logical block size. E.g. Android's
default RS roots=2 results in dm_bufio->block_size=1024, which causes
the following EIO if the logical block size of the device is 4096,
given v->data_dev_block_bits=12:

E sd 0    : 0:0:0: [sda] tag#30 request not aligned to the logical block size
E blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 10368424 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 0
E device-mapper: verity-fec: 254:8: FEC 9244672: parity read failed (block 18056): -5

Fix this by onlu using f->roots for dm_bufio blocksize IFF it is
aligned to v->data_dev_block_bits.
