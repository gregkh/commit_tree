ARM: omap2plus_defconfig: Update for dropped options

Update omap2plus_defconfig for the following options that got dropped:

- We have now default y for MEMCG_SWAP and SECCOMP with the options
  already in omap2plus_defconfig

- The ZBOOT_ROM values now default to 0

- ARM_TI_CPUFREQ no longer exists and we're using the generic driver
  now that selects DT_IDLE_STATES

- POWER_AVS option no longer exists

- The MEDIA and VIDEO related options are now selected when we have
  CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER not set

- CEC_PLATFORM_DRIVERS no longer exists

- MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT is not selected by default
