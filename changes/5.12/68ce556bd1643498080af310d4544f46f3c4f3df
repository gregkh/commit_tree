drm/vmwgfx: Fix the lockdep breakage

Thomas has noticed that the lockdep was broken in vmwgfx. It
was broken during the pci initialization rework. This fixes
the breakage by making sure we initialize the locking code
before doing anything else. This was independently spotted
and fixed by Tetsuo Handa as well.
