net/sctp: fix race condition in sctp_destroy_sock

If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed
from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking.

This can happen in the following functions:
1. In sctp_accept, if sctp_sock_migrate fails.
2. In inet_create or inet6_create, if there is a bpf program
   attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE which denies
   creation of the sctp socket.

The bug is fixed by acquiring addr_wq_lock in sctp_destroy_sock
instead of sctp_close.

This addresses CVE-2021-23133.
