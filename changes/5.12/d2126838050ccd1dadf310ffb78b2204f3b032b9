flow_dissector: fix TTL and TOS dissection on IPv4 fragments

the following command:

 # tc filter add dev $h2 ingress protocol ip pref 1 handle 101 flower \
   $tcflags dst_ip 192.0.2.2 ip_ttl 63 action drop

doesn't drop all IPv4 packets that match the configured TTL / destination
address. In particular, if "fragment offset" or "more fragments" have non
zero value in the IPv4 header, setting of FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_IP is simply
ignored. Fix this dissecting IPv4 TTL and TOS before fragment info; while
at it, add a selftest for tc flower's match on 'ip_ttl' that verifies the
correct behavior.
