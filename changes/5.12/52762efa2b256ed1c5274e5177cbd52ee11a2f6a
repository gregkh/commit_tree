gpu/xen: Fix a use after free in xen_drm_drv_init

In function displback_changed, has the call chain
displback_connect(front_info)->xen_drm_drv_init(front_info).
We can see that drm_info is assigned to front_info->drm_info
and drm_info is freed in fail branch in xen_drm_drv_init().

Later displback_disconnect(front_info) is called and it calls
xen_drm_drv_fini(front_info) cause a use after free by
drm_info = front_info->drm_info statement.

My patch has done two things. First fixes the fail label which
drm_info = kzalloc() failed and still free the drm_info.
Second sets front_info->drm_info to NULL to avoid uaf.
