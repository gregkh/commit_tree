mm/memcg: remove rcu locking for lock_page_lruvec function series

lock_page_lruvec() and its variants used rcu_read_lock() with the
intention of safeguarding against the mem_cgroup being destroyed
concurrently; but so long as they are called under the specified
conditions (as they are), there is no way for the page's mem_cgroup to be
destroyed.  Delete the unnecessary rcu_read_lock() and _unlock().

Hugh Dickins polished the commit log.  Thanks a lot!
