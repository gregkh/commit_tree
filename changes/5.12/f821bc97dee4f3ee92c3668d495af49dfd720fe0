powerpc/64s: move context tracking exit to interrupt exit path

The interrupt handler wrapper functions are not the ideal place to
maintain context tracking because after they return, the low level exit
code must then determine if there are interrupts to replay, or if the
task should be preempted, etc. Those paths (e.g., schedule_user) include
their own exception_enter/exit pairs to fix this up but it's a bit hacky
(see schedule_user() comments).

Ideally context tracking will go to user mode only when there are no
more interrupts or context switches or other exit processing work to
handle.

64e can not do this because it does not use the C interrupt exit code.
