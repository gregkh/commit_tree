driver core: clear deferred probe reason on probe retry

When retrying a deferred probe, any old defer reason string should be
discarded. Otherwise, if the probe is deferred again at a different spot,
but without setting a message, the now incorrect probe reason will remain.

This was observed with the i.MX I2C driver, which ultimately failed
to probe due to lack of the GPIO driver. The probe defer for GPIO
doesn't record a message, but a previous probe defer to clock_get did.
This had the effect that /sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred listed
a misleading probe deferral reason.
