cifs: fix credit accounting for extra channel

With multichannel, operations like the queries
from "ls -lR" can cause all credits to be used and
errors to be returned since max_credits was not
being set correctly on the secondary channels and
thus the client was requesting 0 credits incorrectly
in some cases (which can lead to not having
enough credits to perform any operation on that
channel).
