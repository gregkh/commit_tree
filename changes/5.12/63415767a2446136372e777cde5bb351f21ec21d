ethernet: myri10ge: Fix a use after free in myri10ge_sw_tso

In myri10ge_sw_tso, the skb_list_walk_safe macro will set
(curr) = (segs) and (next) = (curr)->next. If status!=0 is true,
the memory pointed by curr and segs will be free by dev_kfree_skb_any(curr).
But later, the segs is used by segs = segs->next and causes a uaf.

As (next) = (curr)->next, my patch replaces seg->next to next.
