btrfs: zoned: advance allocation pointer after tree log node

Since the allocation info of a tree log node is not recorded in the extent
tree, calculate_alloc_pointer() cannot detect this node, so the pointer
can be over a tree node.

Replaying the log calls btrfs_remove_free_space() for each node in the
log tree.

So, advance the pointer after the node to not allocate over it.
