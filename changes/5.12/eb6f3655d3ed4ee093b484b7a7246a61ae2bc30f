arm64: dts: ti: k3-j7200: Add R5F cluster nodes

The J7200 SoCs have 2 dual-core Arm Cortex-R5F processor (R5FSS)
subsystems/clusters. One R5F cluster is present within the MCU
domain (MCU_R5FSS0), and the other one is present within the MAIN
domain (MAIN_R5FSS0). Each of these can be configured at boot time
to be either run in a LockStep mode or in an Asymmetric Multi
Processing (AMP) fashion in Split-mode. These subsystems have 64 KB
each Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM) internal memories for each core
split between two banks - ATCM and BTCM (further interleaved into
two banks). The TCMs of both Cores are combined in LockStep-mode
to provide a larger 128 KB of memory, but otherwise are functionally
similar to those on J721E SoCs.

Add the DT nodes for both the MCU and MAIN domain R5F cluster/subsystems,
the two R5F cores are added as child nodes to each of the R5F cluster
nodes. The clusters are configured to run in LockStep mode by default,
with the ATCMs enabled to allow the R5 cores to execute code from DDR
with boot-strapping code from ATCM. The inter-processor communication
between the main A72 cores and these processors is achieved through
shared memory and Mailboxes.

The following firmware names are used by default for these cores, and
can be overridden in a board dts file if desired:
   MCU R5FSS0 Core0: j7200-mcu-r5f0_0-fw (both in LockStep and Split modes)
   MCU R5FSS0 Core1: j7200-mcu-r5f0_1-fw (needed only in Split mode)
   MAIN R5FSS0 Core0: j7200-main-r5f0_0-fw (both in LockStep & Split modes)
   MAIN R5FSS0 Core1: j7200-main-r5f0_1-fw (needed only in Split mode)
