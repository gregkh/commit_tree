net/ncsi: Avoid channel_monitor hrtimer deadlock

Calling ncsi_stop_channel_monitor from channel_monitor is a guaranteed
deadlock on SMP because stop calls del_timer_sync on the timer that
invoked channel_monitor as its timer function.

Recognise the inherent race of marking the monitor disabled before
deleting the timer by just returning if enable was cleared.  After
a timeout (the default case -- reset to START when response received)
just mark the monitor.enabled false.

If the channel has an entry on the channel_queue list, or if the
state is not ACTIVE or INACTIVE, then warn and mark the timer stopped
and don't restart, as the locking is broken somehow.
