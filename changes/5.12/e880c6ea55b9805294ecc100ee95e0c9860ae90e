KVM: x86: hyper-v: Prevent using not-yet-updated TSC page by secondary CPUs

When KVM_REQ_MASTERCLOCK_UPDATE request is issued (e.g. after migration)
we need to make sure no vCPU sees stale values in PV clock structures and
thus all vCPUs are kicked with KVM_REQ_CLOCK_UPDATE. Hyper-V TSC page
clocksource is global and kvm_guest_time_update() only updates in on vCPU0
but this is not entirely correct: nothing blocks some other vCPU from
entering the guest before we finish the update on CPU0 and it can read
stale values from the page.

Invalidate TSC page in kvm_gen_update_masterclock() to switch all vCPUs
to using MSR based clocksource (HV_X64_MSR_TIME_REF_COUNT).
