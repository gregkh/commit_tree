perf/x86/kvm: Fix Broadwell Xeon stepping in isolation_ucodes[]

The only stepping of Broadwell Xeon parts is stepping 1. Fix the
relevant isolation_ucodes[] entry, which previously enumerated
stepping 2.

Although the original commit was characterized as an optimization, it
is also a workaround for a correctness issue.

If a PMI arrives between kvm's call to perf_guest_get_msrs() and the
subsequent VM-entry, a stale value for the IA32_PEBS_ENABLE MSR may be
restored at the next VM-exit. This is because, unbeknownst to kvm, PMI
throttling may clear bits in the IA32_PEBS_ENABLE MSR. CPUs with "PEBS
isolation" don't suffer from this issue, because perf_guest_get_msrs()
doesn't report the IA32_PEBS_ENABLE value.
