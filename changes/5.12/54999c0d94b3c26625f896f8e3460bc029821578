staging: comedi: dmm32at: Fix endian problem for AI command data

The analog input subdevice supports Comedi asynchronous commands that
use Comedi's 16-bit sample format.  However, the call to
`comedi_buf_write_samples()` is passing the address of a 32-bit integer
variable.  On bigendian machines, this will copy 2 bytes from the wrong
end of the 32-bit value.  Fix it by changing the type of the variable
holding the sample value to `unsigned short`.

[Note: the bug was introduced in commit 1700529b24cc ("staging: comedi:
dmm32at: use comedi_buf_write_samples()") but the patch applies better
to the later (but in the same kernel release) commit 0c0eadadcbe6e
("staging: comedi: dmm32at: introduce dmm32_ai_get_sample()").]
