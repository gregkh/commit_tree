objtool: Assume only ELF functions do sibling calls

There's an inconsistency in how sibling calls are detected in
non-function asm code, depending on the scope of the object.  If the
target code is external to the object, objtool considers it a sibling
call.  If the target code is internal but not a function, objtool
*doesn't* consider it a sibling call.

This can cause some inconsistencies between per-object and vmlinux.o
validation.

Instead, assume only ELF functions can do sibling calls.  This generally
matches existing reality, and makes sibling call validation consistent
between vmlinux.o and per-object.
