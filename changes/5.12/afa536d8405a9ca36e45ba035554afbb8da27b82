net/sched: cls_flower: fix only mask bit check in the validate_ct_state

The ct_state validate should not only check the mask bit and also
check mask_bit & key_bit..
For the +new+est case example, The 'new' and 'est' bits should be
set in both state_mask and state flags. Or the -new-est case also
will be reject by kernel.
When Openvswitch with two flows
ct_state=+trk+new,action=commit,forward
ct_state=+trk+est,action=forward

A packet go through the kernel  and the contrack state is invalid,
The ct_state will be +trk-inv. Upcall to the ovs-vswitchd, the
finally dp action will be drop with -new-est+trk.
