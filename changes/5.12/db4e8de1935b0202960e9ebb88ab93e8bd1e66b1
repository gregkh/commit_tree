mhi: Fix double dma free

mhi_deinit_chan_ctxt functionthat takes care of unitializing channel
resources, including unmapping coherent MHI areas, can be called
from different path in case of controller unregistering/removal:
 - From a client driver remove callback, via mhi_unprepare_channel
 - From mhi_driver_remove that unitialize all channels

mhi_driver_remove()
|-> driver->remove()
|    |-> mhi_unprepare_channel()
|        |-> mhi_deinit_chan_ctxt()
|...
|-> mhi_deinit_chan_ctxt()

This leads to double dma freeing...

Fix that by preventing deinit for already uninitialized channel.
