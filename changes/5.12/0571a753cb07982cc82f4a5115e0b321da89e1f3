net: pxa168_eth: Fix a potential data race in pxa168_eth_remove

pxa168_eth_remove() firstly calls unregister_netdev(),
then cancels a timeout work. unregister_netdev() shuts down a device
interface and removes it from the kernel tables. If the timeout occurs
in parallel, the timeout work (pxa168_eth_tx_timeout_task) performs stop
and open of the device. It may lead to an inconsistent state and memory
leaks.
