gro: ensure frag0 meets IP header alignment

After commit 0f6925b3e8da ("virtio_net: Do not pull payload in skb->head")
Guenter Roeck reported one failure in his tests using sh architecture.

After much debugging, we have been able to spot silent unaligned accesses
in inet_gro_receive()

The issue at hand is that upper networking stacks assume their header
is word-aligned. Low level drivers are supposed to reserve NET_IP_ALIGN
bytes before the Ethernet header to make that happen.

This patch hardens skb_gro_reset_offset() to not allow frag0 fast-path
if the fragment is not properly aligned.

Some arches like x86, arm64 and powerpc do not care and define NET_IP_ALIGN
as 0, this extra check will be a NOP for them.

Note that if frag0 is not used, GRO will call pskb_may_pull()
as many times as needed to pull network and transport headers.
