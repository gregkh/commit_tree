bio: don't copy bvec for direct IO

The block layer spends quite a while in blkdev_direct_IO() to copy and
initialise bio's bvec. However, if we've already got a bvec in the input
iterator it might be reused in some cases, i.e. when new
ITER_BVEC_FLAG_FIXED flag is set. Simple tests show considerable
performance boost, and it also reduces memory footprint.
