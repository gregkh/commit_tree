objtool,x86: Fix uaccess PUSHF/POPF validation

Commit ab234a260b1f ("x86/pv: Rework arch_local_irq_restore() to not
use popf") replaced "push %reg; popf" with something like: "test
$0x200, %reg; jz 1f; sti; 1:", which breaks the pushf/popf symmetry
that commit ea24213d8088 ("objtool: Add UACCESS validation") relies
on.

The result is:

  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/si.o: warning: objtool: si_common_hw_init()+0xf36: PUSHF stack exhausted

Meanwhile, commit c9c324dc22aa ("objtool: Support stack layout changes
in alternatives") makes that we can actually use stack-ops in
alternatives, which means we can revert 1ff865e343c2 ("x86,smap: Fix
smap_{save,restore}() alternatives").

That in turn means we can limit the PUSHF/POPF handling of
ea24213d8088 to those instructions that are in alternatives.
