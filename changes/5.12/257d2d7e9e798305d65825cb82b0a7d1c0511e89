ALSA: usb-audio: Don't avoid stopping the stream at disconnection

In the later patch, we're going to issue the PCM sync_stop calls at
disconnection.  But currently the USB-audio driver can't handle it
because it has a check of shutdown flag for stopping the URBs.  This
is basically superfluous (the stopping URBs are safe at disconnection
state), so let's drop the check.
