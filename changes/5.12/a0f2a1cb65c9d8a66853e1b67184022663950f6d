dmaengine: ti: k3-psil: optimize struct psil_endpoint_config for size

Optimize struct psil_endpoint_config for size by
- reordering fields
- grouping bitfields
- change mapped_channel_id type to s16 (32K channel is enough)
- default_flow_id type to s16 as it's assigned to -1

text            data     bss    dec	        hex	filename
