isdn: capi: fix mismatched prototypes

gcc-11 complains about a prototype declaration that is different
from the function definition:

drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c:724:44: error: argument 2 of type ‘u8 *’ {aka ‘unsigned char *’} declared as a pointer [-Werror=array-parameter=]

Change the definition to make them match.
