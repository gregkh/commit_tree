libbpf: Clarify kernel type use with USER variants of CORE reading macros

Add comments clarifying that USER variants of CO-RE reading macro are still
only going to work with kernel types, defined in kernel or kernel module BTF.
This should help preventing invalid use of those macro to read user-defined
types (which doesn't work with CO-RE).
