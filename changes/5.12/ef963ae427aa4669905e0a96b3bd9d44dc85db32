ice: Fix potential infinite loop when using u8 loop counter

A for-loop is using a u8 loop counter that is being compared to
a u32 cmp_dcbcfg->numapp to check for the end of the loop. If
cmp_dcbcfg->numapp is larger than 255 then the counter j will wrap
around to zero and hence an infinite loop occurs. Fix this by making
counter j the same type as cmp_dcbcfg->numapp.
