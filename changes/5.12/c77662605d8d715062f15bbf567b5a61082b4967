cteontx2-pf: cn10k: Prevent harmless double shift bugs

These defines are used with set_bit() and test_bit() which take a bit
number.  In other words, the code is doing:

	if (BIT(BIT(1)) & pf->hw.cap_flag) {

This was done consistently so it did not cause a problem at runtime but
it's still worth fixing.
