ice: prevent ice_open and ice_stop during reset

There is a possibility of race between ice_open or ice_stop calls
performed by OS and reset handling routine both trying to modify VSI
resources. Observed scenarios:
- reset handler deallocates memory in ice_vsi_free_arrays and ice_open
  tries to access it in ice_vsi_cfg_txq leading to driver crash
- reset handler deallocates memory in ice_vsi_free_arrays and ice_close
  tries to access it in ice_down leading to driver crash
- reset handler clears port scheduler topology and sets port state to
  ICE_SCHED_PORT_STATE_INIT leading to ice_ena_vsi_txq fail in ice_open

To prevent this additional checks in ice_open and ice_stop are
introduced to make sure that OS is not allowed to alter VSI config while
reset is in progress.
