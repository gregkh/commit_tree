io_uring: fix EIOCBQUEUED iter revert

iov_iter_revert() is done in completion handlers that happensf before
read/write returns -EIOCBQUEUED, no need to repeat reverting afterwards.
Moreover, even though it may appear being just a no-op, it's actually
races with 1) user forging a new iovec of a different size 2) reissue,
that is done via io-wq continues completely asynchronously.
