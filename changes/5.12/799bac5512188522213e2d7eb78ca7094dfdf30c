Revert "net/rds: Avoid potential use after free in rds_send_remove_from_sock"

This reverts commit 0c85a7e87465f2d4cbc768e245f4f45b2f299b05.

The games with 'rm' are on (two separate instances) of a local variable,
and make no difference.

Quoting Aditya Pakki:
 "I was the author of the patch and it was the cause of the giant UMN
  revert.

  The patch is garbage and I was unaware of the steps involved in
  retracting it. I *believed* the maintainers would pull it, given it
  was already under Greg's list. The patch does not introduce any bugs
  but is pointless and is stupid. I accept my incompetence and for not
  requesting a revert earlier."
