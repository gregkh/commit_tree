dma-mapping: remove the {alloc,free}_noncoherent methods

It turns out allowing non-contigous allocations here was a rather bad
idea, as we'll now need to define ways to get the pages for mmaping
or dma_buf sharing.  Revert this change and stick to the original
concept.  A different API for the use case of non-contigous allocations
will be added back later.
