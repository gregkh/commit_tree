ASoC: intel: atom: Stop advertising non working S24LE support

The SST firmware's media and deep-buffer inputs are hardcoded to
S16LE, the corresponding DAIs don't have a hw_params callback and
their prepare callback also does not take the format into account.

So far the advertising of non working S24LE support has not caused
issues because pulseaudio defaults to S16LE, but changing pulse-audio's
config to use S24LE will result in broken sound.

Pipewire is replacing pulse now and pipewire prefers S24LE over S16LE
when available, causing the problem of the broken S24LE support to
come to the surface now.
