drm/mediatek: mtk_dpi: Create connector for bridges

Similar to commit a9d9fea74be2
("drm/mediatek: mtk_dsi: Create connector for bridges"):

Use the drm_bridge_connector helper to create a connector for pipelines
that use drm_bridge. This allows splitting connector operations across
multiple bridges when necessary, instead of having the last bridge in
the chain creating the connector and handling all connector operations
internally.
