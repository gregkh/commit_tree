mm: move pfn_to_online_page() out of line

Patch series "mm: Fix pfn_to_online_page() with respect to ZONE_DEVICE", v4.

A pfn-walker that uses pfn_to_online_page() may inadvertently translate a
pfn as online and in the page allocator, when it is offline managed by a
ZONE_DEVICE mapping (details in Patch 3: ("mm: Teach pfn_to_online_page()
about ZONE_DEVICE section collisions")).

The 2 proposals under consideration are teach pfn_to_online_page() to be
precise in the presence of mixed-zone sections, or teach the memory-add
code to drop the System RAM associated with ZONE_DEVICE collisions.  In
order to not regress memory capacity by a few 10s to 100s of MiB the
approach taken in this set is to add precision to pfn_to_online_page().

In the course of validating pfn_to_online_page() a couple other fixes
fell out:

1/ soft_offline_page() fails to drop the reference taken in the
   madvise(..., MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE) case.

2/ memory_failure() uses get_dev_pagemap() to lookup ZONE_DEVICE pages,
   however that mapping may contain data pages and metadata raw pfns.
   Introduce pgmap_pfn_valid() to delineate the 2 types and fail the
   handling of raw metadata pfns.

This patch (of 4);

pfn_to_online_page() is already too large to be a macro or an inline
function.  In anticipation of further logic changes / growth, move it out
of line.

No functional change, just code movement.
