ice: move headroom initialization to ice_setup_rx_ctx

ice_rx_offset(), that is supposed to initialize the Rx buffer headroom,
relies on ICE_RX_FLAGS_RING_BUILD_SKB flag as well as XDP prog presence.

Currently, the callsite of mentioned function is placed incorrectly
within ice_setup_rx_ring() where Rx ring's build skb flag is not
set yet. This causes the XDP_REDIRECT to be partially broken due to
inability to create xdp_frame in the headroom space, as the headroom is
0.

Fix this by moving ice_rx_offset() to ice_setup_rx_ctx() after the flag
setting.
