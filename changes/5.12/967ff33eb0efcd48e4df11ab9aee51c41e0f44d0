Revert "arm64: dts: marvell: armada-cp110: Switch to per-port SATA interrupts"

The driver part of this support was not merged which leads to break
AHCI on all Marvell Armada 7k8k / CN913x platforms as it was reported
by Marcin Wojtas.

So for now let's remove it in order to fix the issue waiting for the
driver part really be merged.

This reverts commit 53e950d597e3578da84238b86424bfcc9e101d87.
