selinux: fall back to SECURITY_FS_USE_GENFS if no xattr support

When a superblock is assigned the SECURITY_FS_USE_XATTR behavior by the
policy yet it lacks xattr support, try to fall back to genfs rather than
rejecting the mount. If a genfscon rule is found for the filesystem,
then change the behavior to SECURITY_FS_USE_GENFS, otherwise reject the
mount as before. A similar fallback is already done in security_fs_use()
if no behavior specification is found for the given filesystem.

This is needed e.g. for virtiofs, which may or may not support xattrs
depending on the backing host filesystem.

Example:
    # seinfo --genfs | grep ' ramfs'
       genfscon ramfs /  system_u:object_r:ramfs_t:s0
    # echo '(fsuse xattr ramfs (system_u object_r fs_t ((s0) (s0))))' >ramfs_xattr.cil
    # semodule -i ramfs_xattr.cil
    # mount -t ramfs none /mnt

Before:
    mount: /mnt: mount(2) system call failed: Operation not supported.

After:
    (mount succeeds)
    # ls -Zd /mnt
    system_u:object_r:ramfs_t:s0 /mnt
