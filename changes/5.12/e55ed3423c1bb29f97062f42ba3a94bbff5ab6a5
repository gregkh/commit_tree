perf arm-spe: Synthesize memory event

The memory event can deliver two benefits:

- The first benefit is the memory event can give out global view for
  memory accessing, rather than organizing events with scatter mode
  (e.g. uses separate event for L1 cache, last level cache, etc) which
  which can only display a event for single memory type, memory events
  include all memory accessing so it can display the data accessing
  cross memory levels in the same view;

- The second benefit is the sample generation might introduce a big
  overhead and need to wait for long time for Perf reporting, we can
  specify itrace option '--itrace=M' to filter out other events and only
  output memory events, this can significantly reduce the overhead
  caused by generating samples.

This patch is to enable memory event for Arm SPE.
