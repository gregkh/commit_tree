HID: wacom: set EV_KEY and EV_ABS only for non-HID_GENERIC type of devices

Valid HID_GENERIC type of devices set EV_KEY and EV_ABS by wacom_map_usage.
When *_input_capabilities are reached, those devices should already have
their proper EV_* set. EV_KEY and EV_ABS only need to be set for
non-HID_GENERIC type of devices in *_input_capabilities.

Devices that don't support HID descitoprs will pass back to hid-input for
registration without being accidentally rejected by the introduction of
patch: "Input: refuse to register absolute devices without absinfo"
