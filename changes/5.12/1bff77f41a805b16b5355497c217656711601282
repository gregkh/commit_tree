Input: st1232 - fix NORMAL vs. IDLE state handling

NORMAL (0x0) and IDLE (0x4) are really two different states.  Hence you
cannot check for both using a bitmask, as that checks for IDLE only,
breaking operation for devices that are in NORMAL state.

Fix the wait function to report either state as ready.
