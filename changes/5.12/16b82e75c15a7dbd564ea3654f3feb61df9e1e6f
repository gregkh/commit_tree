ASoC: wm8960: Fix wrong bclk and lrclk with pll enabled for some chips

The input MCLK is 12.288MHz, the desired output sysclk is 11.2896MHz
and sample rate is 44100Hz, with the configuration pllprescale=2,
postscale=sysclkdiv=1, some chip may have wrong bclk
and lrclk output with pll enabled in master mode, but with the
configuration pllprescale=1, postscale=2, the output clock is correct.

>From Datasheet, the PLL performs best when f2 is between
90MHz and 100MHz when the desired sysclk output is 11.2896MHz
or 12.288MHz, so sysclkdiv = 2 (f2/8) is the best choice.

So search available sysclk_divs from 2 to 1 other than from 1 to 2.
