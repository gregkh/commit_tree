kernel: don't call do_exit() for PF_IO_WORKER threads

Right now we're never calling get_signal() from PF_IO_WORKER threads, but
in preparation for doing so, don't handle a fatal signal for them. The
workers have state they need to cleanup when exiting, so just return
instead of calling do_exit() on their behalf. The threads themselves will
detect a fatal signal and do proper shutdown.
