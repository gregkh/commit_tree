x86/crash: Fix crash_setup_memmap_entries() out-of-bounds access

Commit in Fixes: added support for kexec-ing a kernel on panic using a
new system call. As part of it, it does prepare a memory map for the new
kernel.

However, while doing so, it wrongly accesses memory it has not
allocated: it accesses the first element of the cmem->ranges[] array in
memmap_exclude_ranges() but it has not allocated the memory for it in
crash_setup_memmap_entries(). As KASAN reports:

  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in crash_setup_memmap_entries+0x17e/0x3a0
  Write of size 8 at addr ffffc90000426008 by task kexec/1187

  (gdb) list *crash_setup_memmap_entries+0x17e
  0xffffffff8107cafe is in crash_setup_memmap_entries (arch/x86/kernel/crash.c:322).

  318     {
  319             unsigned long start, end;
  320
  321             cmem->ranges[0].start = mstart;
  322             cmem->ranges[0].end = mend;
  323             cmem->nr_ranges = 1;
  324
  325             /* Exclude elf header region */
  326             start = image->arch.elf_load_addr;
  (gdb)

Make sure the ranges array becomes a single element allocated.
