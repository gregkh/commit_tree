io_uring: ensure SQPOLL startup is triggered before error shutdown

syzbot reports the following hang:

INFO: task syz-executor.0:12538 can't die for more than 143 seconds.
task:syz-executor.0  state:D stack:28352 pid:12538 ppid:  8423 flags:0x00004004

which is due to exiting after the SQPOLL thread has been created, but
hasn't been started yet. Ensure that we always complete the startup
side when waiting for it to exit.
