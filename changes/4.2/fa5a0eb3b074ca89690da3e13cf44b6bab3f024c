ocfs2: remove OCFS2_IOCB_SEM lock type in direct io

In ocfs2 direct read/write, OCFS2_IOCB_SEM lock type is used to protect
inode->i_alloc_sem rw semaphore lock in the earlier kernel version.
However, in the latest kernel, inode->i_alloc_sem rw semaphore lock is not
used at all, so OCFS2_IOCB_SEM lock type needs to be removed.
