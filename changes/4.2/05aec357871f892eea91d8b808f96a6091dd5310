spi: Add SPI driver for Mikrotik RB4xx series boards

This driver mediates access between the connected CPLD and other devices
on the bus.

The m25p80-compatible boot flash and (some models) MMC use regular SPI,
bitbanged as required by the SoC. However the SPI-connected CPLD has
a two-wire mode, in which two bits are transferred per SPI clock
cycle. The second bit is transmitted with the SoC's CS2 pin.
