there are some serious issues at the audio hook implementation.

They're not following what's specified at the DocBook:
	http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-g-tuner.html#tuner-audmode

Basically, it was assuming that the audmode (V4L2_TUNER_MODE_foo)
is a variable with a bit maskk. However, it isn't.

The bitmask only applies to rxsubchans field (V4L2_TUNER_SUB_foo).

As the code is also too complex, and not all hooks were returning
both audmode and rxsubchans to a VIDIOC_G_TUNER, rewrite the
functions, in order to fix both for get and set tuner ioctls.
