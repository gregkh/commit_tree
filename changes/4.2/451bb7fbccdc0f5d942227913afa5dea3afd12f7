EDAC, xgene: Fix cpuid abuse

The new x-gene EDAC driver incorrectly tried to figure out the version
of one of its IP blocks by looking at the version of the CPU core, which
is only vagely related.

This removes the incorrect code and instead uses the version of the IP
block in the compatible string where it belongs.

Found using build testing on x86, which does not provide the arm64
cpuid interface.
