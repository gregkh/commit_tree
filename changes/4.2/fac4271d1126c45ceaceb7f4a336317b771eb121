xhci: prevent bus_suspend if SS port resuming in phase 1

When the link is just waken, it's in Resume state, and driver sets PLS to
U0. This refers to Phase 1. Phase 2 refers to when the link has completed
the transition from Resume state to U0.

With the fix of xhci: report U3 when link is in resume state, it also
exposes an issue that usb3 roothub and controller can suspend right
after phase 1, and this causes a hard hang in controller.

To fix the issue, we need to prevent usb3 bus suspend if any port is
resuming in phase 1.
