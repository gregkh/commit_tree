bpf: allow BPF programs access skb->skb_iif and skb->dev->ifindex fields

classic BPF already exposes skb->dev->ifindex via SKF_AD_IFINDEX extension.
Allow eBPF program to access it as well. Note that classic aborts execution
of the program if 'skb->dev == NULL' (which is inconvenient for program
writers), whereas eBPF returns zero in such case.
Also expose the 'skb_iif' field, since programs triggered by redirected
packet need to known the original interface index.
Summary:
__skb->ifindex         -> skb->dev->ifindex
__skb->ingress_ifindex -> skb->skb_iif
