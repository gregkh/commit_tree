packet: rollover only to socket with headroom

Only migrate flows to sockets that have sufficient headroom, where
sufficient is defined as having at least 25% empty space.

The kernel has three different buffer types: a regular socket, a ring
with frames (TPACKET_V[12]) or a ring with blocks (TPACKET_V3). The
latter two do not expose a read pointer to the kernel, so headroom is
not computed easily. All three needs a different implementation to
estimate free space.

Tested:
  Ran bench_rollover for 10 sec with 1.5 Mpps of single flow input.

  bench_rollover has as many sockets as there are NIC receive queues
  in the system. Each socket is owned by a process that is pinned to
  one of the receive cpus. RFS is disabled. RPS is enabled with an
  identity mapping (cpu x -> cpu x), to count drops with softnettop.

    lpbb5:/export/hda3/willemb# ./bench_rollover -r -l 1000 -s
    Press [Enter] to exit
