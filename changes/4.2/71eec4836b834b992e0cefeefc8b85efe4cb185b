drivers: PL011: allow avoiding UART enabling/disabling

The SBSA UART should not be enabled or disabled (it is always on),
and consequently the spec lacks the UART_CR register.
Add a vendor specific property to skip disabling or enabling of the
UART. This will be used later by the SBSA UART support.
