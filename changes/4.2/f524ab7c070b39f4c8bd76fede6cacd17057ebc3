drm: omapdrm: add lock for fb pinning

Before atomic modesetting omap_framebuffer_pin() and
omap_framebuffer_unpin() were always called with modesetting locks
taken. With atomic modesetting support this is no longer the case, and
we need locking to protect the pin_count and the paddr, as multiple
threads may pin the same fb concurrently.

This patch adds a mutex to struct omap_framebuffer, and uses it in
omap_framebuffer_pin() and omap_framebuffer_unpin().
