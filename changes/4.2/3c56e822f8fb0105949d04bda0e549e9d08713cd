vfio: powerpc/spapr: Disable DMA mappings on disabled container

At the moment DMA map/unmap requests are handled irrespective to
the container's state. This allows the user space to pin memory which
it might not be allowed to pin.

This adds checks to MAP/UNMAP that the container is enabled, otherwise
-EPERM is returned.
