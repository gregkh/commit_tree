  Subject: ACPI: EC: Merge IRQ and POLL modes
The irqs_disabled() check introduced in it tries to fall into busy polling
mode when the context of ec_poll() cannot sleep.

Actually ec_poll() is ensured to be invoked in the contexts that can sleep
(from a sysfs /sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io access, or from
acpi_evaluate_object(), or from acpi_ec_gpe_poller()). Without the MSI
quirk, we never saw the udelay() logic invoked. Thus this check is useless
and can be removed.
