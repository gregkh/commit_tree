ixgbe: add array of MAC type dependent values

Some of the register addresses and format where unfortunately changed
between MAC types. To get around this we add a const u32 *mvals pointer
to the ixgbe_hw struct to point to an array of mac-type-dependent
values.  These can include register offsets, masks, whatever can be in
a u32. When the ixgbe_hw struct is initialized, a pointer to the
appropriate array must be set.
