powerpc: Show utsname->machine in boot-up banner

Currently we print "Starting Linux PPC64" at boot. But we don't mention
anywhere whether the kernel is big or little endian.

If we print the utsname->machine value instead we get either "ppc64" or
"ppc64le" which is much more informative, eg:

  Starting Linux ppc64le #1 SMP Wed Apr 15 12:12:20 AEST 2015
