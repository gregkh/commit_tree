ASoC: wm_adsp: Add basic support for rev 1 firmware file format

Revision one of the file format includes new algorithm and coefficient
blocks which provide additional information about the controls exported
by the firmware. This patch updates the processing to handle this
version of the file format. Note that whilst this version of the format
adds support for specifying a name for the control through the firmware
file this has not been used and to keep compatibility with existing
deployments no changes to the firmware control naming are made by this
patch.
