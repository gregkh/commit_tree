i2c: davinci: Optimize SCL generation

There are several cases where current clock configuration algorithm produces
not optimal results:
- truncation in "clk" calculation leads to the fact that actual BUS frequency
  will be always higher than spec except two exact module frequences 8MHz and
  12MHz in the whole 7-12MHz range of permitted frequences
- driver configures SCL HIGH to LOW ratio always 1 to 1 and this doesn't work
  well in 400kHz case, namely minimum time of LOW state (according to I2C Spec
  2.1) 1.3us will not be fulfilled. HIGH to LOW ratio 1 to 2 would be more
  approriate here.
