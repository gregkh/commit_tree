bpf: allow networking programs to use bpf_trace_printk() for debugging

bpf_trace_printk() is a helper function used to debug eBPF programs.
Let socket and TC programs use it as well.
Note, it's DEBUG ONLY helper. If it's used in the program,
the kernel will print warning banner to make sure users don't use
it in production.
