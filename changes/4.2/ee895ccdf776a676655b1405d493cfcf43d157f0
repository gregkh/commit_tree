misc: sram: fix enabled clock leak on error path

If devm_gen_pool_create() fails, the previously enabled sram->clk is
not disabled on probe() exit.

Because reserved block logic relies only on information from device tree,
there is no need to get and enable device clock in advance, especially
because not provided clock is not considered as an error, so it is
safe to place devm_clk_get() at the end of probe(). No functional
change.
