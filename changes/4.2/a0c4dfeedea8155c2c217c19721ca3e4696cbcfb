drivers/clk: include <module.h> for clk-max77xxx modular code

These files are built off of the tristate COMMON_CLK_MAX77686 and
COMMON_CLK_MAX77802 respectively.  They also contains modular function
calls so they should explicitly include module.h to avoid compile
breakage during header shuffles done in the future.
