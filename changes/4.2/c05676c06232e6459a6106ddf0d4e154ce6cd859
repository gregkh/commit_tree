perf report: Fix sort__sym_cmp to also compare end of symbol

When using a map file from a JIT, due to memory reuse, we can obtain
multiple symbols with the same start address but a different length.

The symbols__find does check for the end so not doing it in
sort__sym_cmp was causing the hist_entry in the annotate part of a
report to match to the wrong entry, causing a fatal error.
