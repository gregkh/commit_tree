thermal: intel Quark SoC X1000 DTS thermal driver

In Intel Quark SoC X1000, there is one on-die digital temperature sensor(DTS).
The DTS offers both hot & critical trip points.

However, in current distribution of UEFI BIOS for Quark platform, only
critical trip point is configured to be 105 degree Celsius (based on Quark
SW ver1.0.1 and hot trip point is not used due to lack of IRQ.

There is no active cooling device for Quark SoC, so Quark SoC thermal
management logic expects Linux distro to orderly power-off when temperature
of the DTS exceeds the configured critical trip point.

Kernel param "polling_delay" in milliseconds is used to control the frequency
the DTS temperature is read by thermal framework. It defaults to 2-second.
To change it, use kernel boot param "intel_quark_dts_thermal.polling_delay=X".

User interacts with Quark SoC DTS thermal driver through sysfs via:
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/

For example:
 - to read DTS temperature
   $ cat temp
 - to read critical trip point
   $ cat trip_point_0_temp
 - to read trip point type
   $ cat trip_point_0_type
 - to emulate temperature raise to test orderly shutdown by Linux distro
   $ echo 105 > emul_temp
