ARM: dts: rockchip: relicense rk3066a.dtsi under GPLv2/X11

GPLv2-only devicetrees make reuse difficult for software components licensed
under a different license.

The consensus is that a GPL/X11 dual-license should allow all necessary uses,
so relicense the rk3066a.dtsi to this combination.

CCs were aquired by git shortlog -sne so it should've hopefully catched
every contributor.
