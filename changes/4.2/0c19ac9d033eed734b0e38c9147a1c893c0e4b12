drm: omapdrm: Fix page flip race with CRTC disable

We can't rely on crtc->primary->fb in the page flip worker, as a racing
CRTC disable (due for instance to an explicit framebuffer deletion from
userspace) would set that field to NULL before the worker gets a change
to run. Store the framebuffer queued for page flip in a new field of
omap_crtc instead, and hold a reference to it.
