IB/mad cleanup: Generalize processing of MAD data

ib_find_send_mad only needs access to the MAD header not the full IB MAD.
Change the local variable to ib_mad_hdr and change the corresponding cast.

This allows for clean usage of this function with both IB and OPA MADs because
OPA MADs carry the same header as IB MADs.
