ASoC: Intel: Remove invalid kfree of devm allocated data

kbuild robot reports following warning:
"sound/soc/intel/haswell/sst-haswell-ipc.c:2204:1-6:
 WARNING: invalid free of devm_ allocated data"

As julia explains to me, the memory allocated with devm_kalloc
is freed automatically on failure of a probe function. So this
kfree should be removed otherwise the double free will be got in
error handler path.
