libceph: store timeouts in jiffies, verify user input

There are currently three libceph-level timeouts that the user can
specify on mount: mount_timeout, osd_idle_ttl and osdkeepalive.  All of
these are in seconds and no checking is done on user input: negative
values are accepted, we multiply them all by HZ which may or may not
overflow, arbitrarily large jiffies then get added together, etc.

There is also a bug in the way mount_timeout=0 is handled.  It's
supposed to mean "infinite timeout", but that's not how wait.h APIs
treat it and so __ceph_open_session() for example will busy loop
without much chance of being interrupted if none of ceph-mons are
there.

Fix all this by verifying user input, storing timeouts capped by
msecs_to_jiffies() in jiffies and using the new ceph_timeout_jiffies()
helper for all user-specified waits to handle infinite timeouts
correctly.
