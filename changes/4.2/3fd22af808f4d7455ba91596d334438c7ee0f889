sock_diag: specify info_size per inet protocol

Previously, there was no clear distinction between the inet protocols
that used struct tcp_info to report information and those that didn't.
This change adds a specific size attribute to the inet_diag_handler
struct which defines these interfaces.  This will make dispatching
sock_diag get_info requests identical for all inet protocols in a
following patch.
