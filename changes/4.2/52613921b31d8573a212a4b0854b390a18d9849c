Revert "drm/i915: Allocate context objects from stolen"

Stolen gets trashed during hibernation, so storing contexts there
is not a very good idea. On my IVB machines this leads to a totally
dead GPU on resume. A reboot is required to resurrect it. So let's
not store contexts where they will get trampled.

This reverts commit 149c86e74fe44dcbac5e9f8d145c5fbc5dc21261.
