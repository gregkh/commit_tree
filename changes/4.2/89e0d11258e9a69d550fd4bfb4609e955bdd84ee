xprtrdma: Use ib_device pointer safely

The connect worker can replace ri_id, but prevents ri_id->device
from changing during the lifetime of a transport instance. The old
ID is kept around until a new ID is created and the ->device is
confirmed to be the same.

Cache a copy of ri_id->device in rpcrdma_ia and in rpcrdma_rep.
The cached copy can be used safely in code that does not serialize
with the connect worker.

Other code can use it to save an extra address generation (one
pointer dereference instead of two).
