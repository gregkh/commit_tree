arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Do not save GICH_HCR / ICH_HCR_EL2

The GIC Hypervisor Configuration Register is used to enable
the delivery of virtual interupts to a guest, as well as to
define in which conditions maintenance interrupts are delivered
to the host.

This register doesn't contain any information that we need to
read back (the EOIcount is utterly useless for us).

So let's save ourselves some cycles, and not save it before
writing zero to it.
