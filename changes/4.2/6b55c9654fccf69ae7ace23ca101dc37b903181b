sched/debug: Move print_cfs_rq() declaration to kernel/sched/sched.h

Currently print_cfs_rq() is declared in include/linux/sched.h.
However it's not used outside kernel/sched. Hence move the
declaration to kernel/sched/sched.h

Also some functions are only available for CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y.
Hence move the declarations to within the #ifdef.
