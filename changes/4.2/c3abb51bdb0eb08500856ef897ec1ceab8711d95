IB/mlx4: Add RoCE/IB dedicated counters

This is an infrastructure step to attach all the QPs opened from the
IB driver to a counter in order to collect VF stats from the PF using
those counters.

If the port's type is Ethernet, the counter policy demands two counters
per port (one for RoCE and one for Ethernet). The port default counter
(allocated in mlx4_core) is used for the Ethernet netdev QPs and we
allocate another counter for RoCE.

If the port's traffic is Infiniband, the counter policy demands
one counter per port, so it can use the port's default counter.

Also, Add 'allocated' flag for each counter in order to clean it at
unload.
