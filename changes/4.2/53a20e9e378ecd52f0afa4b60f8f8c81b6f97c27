staging: wilc1000: disable driver due to build warnings

The wilc1000 has just too many build warnings to be able to enable it
for the 4.2 release.  Given that there have not been any patches
submitted to properly fix these obvious errors, I'm going to disable it
for now.  I will enable it back when the build warning fixes are
submitted, or, if that never happens, I will remove it from the tree.
