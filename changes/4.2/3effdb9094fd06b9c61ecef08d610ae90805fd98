target: simplify backend attribute implementation

Consolidate the implementation of the backend attributes in a single file
and single function per attribute show/store function instead of splitting
it into multiple functions in multiple files.

Also use the proper strto* helpers for exposed data types, add macros to
implement the store methods for the most common data types and share the
show methods between the two different attribute implementations.

(Fix bogus store_pi_prot_format flag=0 return value - nab)
