usb-storage: Add ignore-device quirk for gm12u320 based usb mini projectors

Grain-media GM12U320 based devices are mini video projectors using USB for
both power and video data transport.

Their usb-storage interface is a virtual windows driver CD.

The gm12u320 kms driver needs these interfaces to talk to the device and
export it as framebuffer & kms dri device nodes, so make sure that the
usb-storage driver does not bind to it.
