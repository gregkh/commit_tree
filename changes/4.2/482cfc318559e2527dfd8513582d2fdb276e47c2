netfilter: xtables: avoid percpu ruleset duplication

We store the rule blob per (possible) cpu.  Unfortunately this means we can
waste lot of memory on big smp machines. ipt_entry structure ('rule head')
is 112 byte, so e.g. with maxcpu=64 one single rule eats
close to 8k RAM.

Since previous patch made counters percpu it appears there is nothing
left in the rule blob that needs to be percpu.

On my test system (144 possible cpus, 400k dummy rules) this
change saves close to 9 Gigabyte of RAM.
