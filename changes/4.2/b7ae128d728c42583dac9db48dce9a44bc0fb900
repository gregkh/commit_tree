ahci: Add support for Cavium's ThunderX host controller

This patch adds support for Cavium's ThunderX host controller. The
controller resides on the SoC and is a AHCI compatible SATA controller
with one port, compliant with Serial ATA 3.1 and AHCI Revision 1.31.
There can exists multiple SATA controllers on the SoC.

The controller depends on MSI-X support since the PCI ECAM controller
on the SoC does not implement MSI nor lagacy intx interrupt support.
Thus, during device initialization, if MSI fails MSI-X will be used to
enable the device's interrupts.

The controller uses non-standard BAR0 for its register range. The
already existing device lookup (vendor and device id) that is already
implemented for other host controllers is used to change the PCI BAR.
