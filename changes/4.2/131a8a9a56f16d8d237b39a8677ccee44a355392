HID: sony: Prevent the freeing of an unitialized ida value

sony_allocate_output_report() was being called before sony_set_device_id()
which meant that an unallocated ida value was was freed if the output
report allocation failed and the probe function jumped to err_stop.

Do the device ID allocation before the output report allocation to avoid
freeing an unallocated value in case of a failure.
