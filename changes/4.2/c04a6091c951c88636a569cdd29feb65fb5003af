iscsi-target: remove support for obsolete markers

Support for markers is currently broken because of a bug in
iscsi_enforce_integrity_rules(): the "IFMarkInt_Reject" and
"OFMarkInt_Reject" variables are always equal to 1 in
iscsi_enforce_integrity_rules().

Moreover, fixed interval markers keys (IFMarker, OFMarker, IFMarkInt
and OFMarkInt) are obsolete according to iSCSI RFC 7143:

>From http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7143#section-13.25:

   13.25.  Obsoleted Keys

   This document obsoletes the following keys defined in [RFC3720]:
   IFMarker, OFMarker, OFMarkInt, and IFMarkInt.  However, iSCSI
   implementations compliant to this document may still receive these
   obsoleted keys -- i.e., in a responder role -- in a text negotiation.

   When an IFMarker or OFMarker key is received, a compliant iSCSI
   implementation SHOULD respond with the constant "Reject" value.  The
   implementation MAY alternatively respond with a "No" value.

   However, the implementation MUST NOT respond with a "NotUnderstood"
   value for either of these keys.

   When an IFMarkInt or OFMarkInt key is received, a compliant iSCSI
   implementation MUST respond with the constant "Reject" value.  The
   implementation MUST NOT respond with a "NotUnderstood" value for
   either of these keys.

This patch disables markers by turning the corresponding parameters to
read-only. The default value of IFMarker and OFMarker remains "No" but
the user cannot change it to "Yes" anymore. The new value of IFMarkInt
and OFMarkInt is "Reject".
