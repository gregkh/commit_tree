xfs: handle sparse inode chunks in icreate log recovery

Recovery of icreate transactions assumes hardcoded values for the inode
count and chunk length.

Sparse inode chunks are allocated in units of m_ialloc_min_blks. Update
the icreate validity checks to allow for appropriately sized inode
chunks and verify the inode count matches what is expected based on the
extent length rather than assuming a hardcoded count.
