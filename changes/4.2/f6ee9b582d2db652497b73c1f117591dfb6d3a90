spi: imx: Fix small DMA transfers

DMA transfers must be greater than the watermark level size. spi_imx->rx_wml
and spi_imx->tx_wml contain the watermark level in 32bit words whereas struct
spi_transfer contains the transfer len in bytes. Fix the check if DMA is
possible for a transfer accordingly. This fixes transfers with sizes between
33 and 128 bytes for which previously was claimed that DMA is possible.
