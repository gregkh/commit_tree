crypto: aead - Convert top level interface to new style

This patch converts the top-level aead interface to the new style.
All user-level AEAD interface code have been moved into crypto/aead.h.

The allocation/free functions have switched over to the new way of
allocating tfms.

This patch also removes the double indrection on setkey so the
indirection now exists only at the alg level.

Apart from these there are no user-visible changes.
