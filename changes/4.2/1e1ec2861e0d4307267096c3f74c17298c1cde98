iio: Require strict scan mask matching in hardware mode

In hardware mode we can not use the software demuxer, this means that the
selected scan mask needs to match one of the available scan masks exactly.

It also means that all attached buffers need to use the same scan mask.
Given that when operating in hardware mode there is typically only a single
buffer attached to the device this not an issue. Add a sanity check to make
sure that only a single buffer is attached in hardware mode nevertheless.
