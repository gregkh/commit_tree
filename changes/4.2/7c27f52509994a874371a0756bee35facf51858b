    drm/i915: Restrict GPU boost to the RCS engine

The premise that media/blitter workloads are not affected by boosting is
patently false with a trip through igt. The question that remains is
what exactly is going wrong with the media workload that prompted this?
Hopefully that would be fixed by the missing agressive downclocking, in
addition to the extra restrictions imposed on how frequent a process is
allowed to boost.
