x86: perf_event_intel_pt.c: use arch_initcall to hook in enabling

This was using module_init, but the current Kconfig situation is
as follows:

In arch/x86/kernel/cpu/Makefile:

  obj-$(CONFIG_CPU_SUP_INTEL)    += perf_event_intel_pt.o perf_event_intel_bts.o

and in arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu:

  config CPU_SUP_INTEL
        default y
        bool "Support Intel processors" if PROCESSOR_SELECT

So currently, the end user can not build this code into a module.
If in the future, there is desire for this to be modular, then
it can be changed to include <linux/module.h> and use module_init.

But currently, in the non-modular case, a module_init becomes a
device_initcall.  But this really isn't a device, so we should
choose a more appropriate initcall bucket to put it in.

The obvious choice here seems to be arch_initcall, but that does
make it earlier than it was currently through device_initcall.
As long as perf_pmu_register() is functional, we should be OK.
