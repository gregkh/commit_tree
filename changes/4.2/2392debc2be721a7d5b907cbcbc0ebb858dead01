ipv4: consider TOS in fib_select_default

fib_select_default considers alternative routes only when
res->fi is for the first alias in res->fa_head. In the
common case this can happen only when the initial lookup
matches the first alias with highest TOS value. This
prevents the alternative routes to require specific TOS.

This patch solves the problem as follows:

- routes that require specific TOS should be returned by
fib_select_default only when TOS matches, as already done
in fib_table_lookup. This rule implies that depending on the
TOS we can have many different lists of alternative gateways
and we have to keep the last used gateway (fa_default) in first
alias for the TOS instead of using single tb_default value.

- as the aliases are ordered by many keys (TOS desc,
fib_priority asc), we restrict the possible results to
routes with matching TOS and lowest metric (fib_priority)
and routes that match any TOS, again with lowest metric.

For example, packet with TOS 8 can not use gw3 (not lowest
metric), gw4 (different TOS) and gw6 (not lowest metric),
all other gateways can be used:

tos 8 via gw1 metric 2 <--- res->fa_head and res->fi
tos 8 via gw2 metric 2
tos 8 via gw3 metric 3
tos 4 via gw4
tos 0 via gw5
tos 0 via gw6 metric 1
