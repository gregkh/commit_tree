gpio: sysfs: clean up chip class-device handling

Clean gpio-chip class device registration and deregistration.

The class device is registered when a gpio-chip is added (or from
gpiolib_sysfs_init post-core init call), and deregistered when the chip
is removed.

Store the class device in struct gpio_chip directly rather than do a
class-device lookup on deregistration. This also removes the need for
the exported flag.
