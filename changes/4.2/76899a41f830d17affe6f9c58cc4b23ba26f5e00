crypto: drbg - replace spinlock with mutex

The creation of a shadow copy is intended to only hold a short term
lock. But the drawback is that parallel users have a very similar DRBG
state which only differs by a high-resolution time stamp.

The DRBG will now hold a long term lock. Therefore, the lock is changed
to a mutex which implies that the DRBG can only be used in process
context.

The lock now guards the instantiation as well as the entire DRBG
generation operation. Therefore, multiple callers are fully serialized
when generating a random number.

As the locking is changed to use a long-term lock to avoid such similar
DRBG states, the entire creation and maintenance of a shadow copy can be
removed.
