ASoC: topology: Add Kconfig option for topology

Allow the topology code to be compiled out so that users who don't need
topology don't need to havve the code compiled in, saving them some
memory.

Some more configuration could be added to remove some of the hooks into
the core data structures but that is probably best done with some
refactoring to use functions to do the updates of the data structures
rather than ifdefing in the code as we'd need to do at the minute.
