libnvdimm: control character device and nvdimm_bus sysfs attributes

The control device for a nvdimm_bus is registered as an "nd" class
device.  The expectation is that there will usually only be one "nd" bus
registered under /sys/class/nd.  However, we allow for the possibility
of multiple buses and they will listed in discovery order as
ndctl0...ndctlN.  This character device hosts the ioctl for passing
control messages.  The initial command set has a 1:1 correlation with
the commands listed in the by the "NFIT DSM Example" document [1], but
this scheme is extensible to future command sets.

Note, nd_ioctl() and the backing ->ndctl() implementation are defined in
a subsequent patch.  This is simply the initial registrations and sysfs
attributes.
