api: fix compatibility of linux/in.h with netinet/in.h

This fixes breakage to iproute2 build with recent kernel headers
caused by:

   netfilter: don't pull include/linux/netfilter.h from netns headers

The issue is that definitions in linux/in.h overlap with those
in netinet/in.h. This patch solves this by introducing the same
mechanism as was used to solve the same problem with linux/in6.h
