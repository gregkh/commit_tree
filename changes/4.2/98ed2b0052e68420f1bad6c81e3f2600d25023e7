mm/memory-failure: give up error handling for non-tail-refcounted thp

"non anonymous thp" case is still racy with freeing thp, which causes
panic due to put_page() for refcount-0 page.  It seems that closing up
this race might be hard (and/or not worth doing,) so let's give up the
error handling for this case.
