i2c: core: Reduce stack size of acpi_i2c_space_handler()

sizeof(struct i2c_client) is 1088 bytes on a CONFIG_X86_64=y build and
produces following warning when CONFIG_FRAME_WARN is set to 1024:

drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c: In function ‘acpi_i2c_space_handler’:
drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:367:1: warning: the frame size of 1152 bytes is
larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

This is not critical given that kernel stack is 16 kB on x86_64 but lets
reduce the stack usage by allocating the struct i2c_client from the heap.
