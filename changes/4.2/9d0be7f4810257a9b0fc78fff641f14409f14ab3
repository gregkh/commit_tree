thermal: support slope and offset coefficients

It is common to have a linear extrapolation from
the current sensor readings and the actual temperature
value. This is specially the case when the sensor
is in use to extrapolate hotspots.

This patch adds slope and offset constants for
single sensor linear extrapolation equation. Because
the same sensor can be use in different locations,
from board to board, these constants are added
as part of thermal_zone_params.

The constants are available through sysfs.

It is up to the device driver to determine
the usage of these values.
