lpfc: The lpfc driver does not issue RFF_ID and RFT_ID in the correct sequence

The order (it's a shall, but hard to dictate after the fact) is given in
FC-SCM - kind of.  SCM indicates what shall be implemented, lists it as (a),
(b), (c), but actually doesn't say it has to be in that order.  The only hard
requirement, called out in FCP-4, is that you must register your FC-4 Type
(via RFT_ID) before registering FC-4 Type Features (via RFF_ID), which makes
sense. We obviously violated this and there were some switches (or newer fw in
them) that enforced it.  The other rule of thumbs are: register your data with
the switch first, then register for SCRs, then do queries about the fabric,
with the SCRs telling you of changes post the queries.
