PCI: Make pci_msi_setup_pci_dev() non-static for use by arch code

Commit 1851617cd2da ("PCI/MSI: Disable MSI at enumeration even if kernel
doesn't support MSI") changed the location of the code that initialises
dev->msi_cap/msix_cap and then disables MSI/MSI-X interrupts at PCI
probe time in devices that have this flag set. It moved the code from
pci_msi_init_pci_dev() to a new function named pci_msi_setup_pci_dev(),
called by pci_setup_device().

The pseries PCI probing code does not call pci_setup_device(), so since
the aforementioned commit the function pci_msi_setup_pci_dev() is not
called and MSI/MSI-X interrupts are left enabled. Additionally because
dev->msi_cap/msix_cap are not initialised no driver can ever enable
MSI/MSI-X.

To fix this, the pseries PCI probe should manually call
pci_msi_setup_pci_dev(), so this patch makes it non-static.
