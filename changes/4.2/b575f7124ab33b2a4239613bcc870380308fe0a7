char: misc: restore MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR on device_create() failure

On attempt to register a dynamic minor misc device its minor number is
updated to a virtual minor number prior to device_create() call,
however on error path misc->minor == MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR is not
restored.

Following the rule of thumb that a function returning an error must
not change the state of the caller, assign MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR back.

The problem is met in a sutuation, when subsys_initcall(misc_init) is
not yet called and misc_class is not created, but misc_register()
modifies statically defined ".minor = MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR", therefore
implicitly changing the client's logic on next attempt (e.g. retrying
from deferred list) to register a misc device, whose minor number is
converted from dynamic to some unknown static one.
