target: Merge sbc_verify_dif_read|write

Instead of providing DIF verify routines for read/write
that are almost identical and conditionally copy protection
information, just let the caller do the right thing.

Have a single sbc_dif_verify that handles an sgl (that
does NOT copy any data) and a protection information copy
routine used by rd_mcp and fileio backend.

In the WRITE case, call sbc_dif_verify with cmd->t_prot_sg
and then do the copy from it to local sgl (assuming the verify
succeeded of course). In the READ case, call sbc_dif_verify
with the local sgl and if it succeeds, copy it to t_prot_sg (or
not if we are stripping it).

(Fix apply breakage from commit c836777 - nab)
