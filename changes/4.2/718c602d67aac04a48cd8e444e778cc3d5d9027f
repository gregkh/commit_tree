perf evlist: Add support for mmapping an AUX area buffer

This patch supports the addition to the kernel of AUX area buffers that
can be mmapped separately from the perf-events buffer.

The AUX buffer can be configured to contain hardware-produced trace
information. The first implementation will support Intel BTS and Intel
PT.

One auxtrace buffer is mmapped per perf-events buffer.  If the requested
auxtrace buffer size is zero, which it will be until further support is
added, then no auxtrace mmapping is attempted.
