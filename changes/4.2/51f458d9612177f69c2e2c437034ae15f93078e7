mac80211: fix locking in update_vlan_tailroom_need_count()

Unfortunately, Michal's change to fix AP_VLAN crypto tailroom
caused a locking issue that was reported by lockdep, but only
in a few cases - the issue was a classic ABBA deadlock caused
by taking the mtx after the key_mtx, where normally they're
taken the other way around.

As the key mutex protects the field in question (I'm adding a
few annotations to make that clear) only the iteration needs
to be protected, but we can also iterate the interface list
with just RCU protection while holding the key mutex.
