ebpf: allow bpf_ktime_get_ns_proto also for networking

As this is already exported from tracing side via commit d9847d310ab4
("tracing: Allow BPF programs to call bpf_ktime_get_ns()"), we might
as well want to move it to the core, so also networking users can make
use of it, e.g. to measure diffs for certain flows from ingress/egress.
