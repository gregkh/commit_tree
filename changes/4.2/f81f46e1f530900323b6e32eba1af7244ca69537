usb: dwc2: implement hibernation during bus suspend/resume

Allow controller to enter in hibernation during usb bus suspend and
inform both phy and gadget about the suspended state.
While in hibernation, the controller can't detect the resume condition.
An external mechanism must call usb_phy_set_suspend on resume.
Exit hibernation when controller gets the resume interrupt and inform
only gadget driver about it.
