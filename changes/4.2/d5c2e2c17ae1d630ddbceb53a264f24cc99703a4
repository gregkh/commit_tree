perf probe ppc64le: Prefer symbol table lookup over DWARF

Use symbol table lookups by default if DWARF is not necessary, since
powerpc ABIv2 encodes local entry points in the symbol table and the
function entry address in DWARF may not be appropriate for kprobes, as
described here:

https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17638

"The DWARF address ranges deliberately include the *whole* function,
both global and local entry points."
...
"If you want to set probes on a local entry point, you should look up
the symbol in the main symbol table (not DWARF), and check the st_other
bits; they will indicate whether the function has a local entry point,
and what its offset from the global entry point is.  Note that GDB does
the same when setting a breakpoint on a function entry."
