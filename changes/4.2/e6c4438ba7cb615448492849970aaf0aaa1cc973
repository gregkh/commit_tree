blk-mq: fix plugging in blk_sq_make_request

The following appears in blk_sq_make_request:

	/*
	 * If we have multiple hardware queues, just go directly to
	 * one of those for sync IO.
	 */

We clearly don't have multiple hardware queues, here!  This comment was
introduced with this commit 07068d5b8e (blk-mq: split make request
handler for multi and single queue):

    We want slightly different behavior from them:

    - On single queue devices, we currently use the per-process plug
      for deferred IO and for merging.

    - On multi queue devices, we don't use the per-process plug, but
      we want to go straight to hardware for SYNC IO.

The old code had this:

        use_plug = !is_flush_fua && ((q->nr_hw_queues == 1) || !is_sync);

and that was converted to:

	use_plug = !is_flush_fua && !is_sync;

which is not equivalent.  For the single queue case, that second half of
the && expression is always true.  So, what I think was actually inteded
follows (and this more closely matches what is done in blk_queue_bio).

V2: delete the 'likely', which should not be a big deal
