sysfs: Add support for permanently empty directories to serve as mount points.

Add two functions sysfs_create_mount_point and
sysfs_remove_mount_point that hang a permanently empty directory off
of a kobject or remove a permanently emptpy directory hanging from a
kobject.  Export these new functions so modular filesystems can use
them.
