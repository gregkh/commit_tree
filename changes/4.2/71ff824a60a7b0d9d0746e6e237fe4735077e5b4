perf tools: Fix dso__data_read_offset() file opening

When dso__data_read_offset/addr() is called without prior dso__data_fd()
(or other functions which call it internally), it failed to open dso in
data_file_size() since its binary type was not identified.

However calling dso__data_fd() in dso__data_read_offset() will hurt
performance as it grabs a global lock everytime.  So factor out the loop
on the binary type in dso__data_fd(), and call it from both.
