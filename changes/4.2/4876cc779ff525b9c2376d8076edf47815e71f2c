SUNRPC: Ensure we release the TCP socket once it has been closed

This fixes a regression introduced by commit caf4ccd4e88cf2 ("SUNRPC:
Make xs_tcp_close() do a socket shutdown rather than a sock_release").
Prior to that commit, the autoclose feature would ensure that an
idle connection would result in the socket being both disconnected and
released, whereas now only gets disconnected.

While the current behaviour is harmless, it does leave the port bound
until either RPC traffic resumes or the RPC client is shut down.
