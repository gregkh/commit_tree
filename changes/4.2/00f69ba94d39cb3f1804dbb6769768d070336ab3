ARM: dts: sun5i: Add A10s and A13 SRAM and SRAM controller

The A10s and A13 have a few SRAM that can be mapped either to a device or
to the CPU, with the mapping being controlled by a SRAM controller.

Add the SRAM controller, the SRAM that it drives and the section that can
be used by the various devices.
