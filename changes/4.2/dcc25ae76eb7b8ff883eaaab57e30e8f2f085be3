writeback: move global_dirty_limit into wb_domain

This patch is a part of the series to define wb_domain which
represents a domain that wb's (bdi_writeback's) belong to and are
measured against each other in.  This will enable IO backpressure
propagation for cgroup writeback.

global_dirty_limit exists to regulate the global dirty threshold which
is a property of the wb_domain.  This patch moves hard_dirty_limit,
dirty_lock, and update_time into wb_domain.

This is pure reorganization and doesn't introduce any behavioral
changes.
