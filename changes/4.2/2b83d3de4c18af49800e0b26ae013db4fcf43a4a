NFSv4/pnfs: Ensure we don't miss a file extension

pNFS writes don't return attributes, however that doesn't mean that we
should ignore the fact that they may be extending the file. This patch
ensures that if a write is seen to extend the file, then we always set
an attribute barrier, and update the cached file size.
