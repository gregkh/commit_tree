pcmcia: Fix resource leaks in yenta_probe() and _close()

There are some resource leaks in yenta_probe() and _close(). I fixed
the following issues with some code cleanups. Thanks to Dominik's
suggestions.

On the error path in yenta_probe():
- a requested irq is not released
- yenta_free_resources() and pci_set_drvdata(dev, NULL) are not called

In yenta_close():
- kfree(sock) is not called
- sock->base is always set to non-NULL when yenta_close() is called,
  therefore the check in yenta_close() is not necessary.
