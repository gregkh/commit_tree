of: constify drv arg of of_driver_match_device stub

With this change the stub has the same signature as the actual function,
preventing this compiler warning when building without CONFIG_OF:

   drivers/base/property.c: In function 'fwnode_driver_match_device':
>> drivers/base/property.c:608:38: warning: passing argument 2 of 'of_driver_match_device' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type
      return of_driver_match_device(dev, drv);
                                         ^
