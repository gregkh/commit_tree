KVM: nSVM: Check for NRIPS support before updating control field

If hardware doesn't support DecodeAssist - a feature that provides
more information about the intercept in the VMCB, KVM decodes the
instruction and then updates the next_rip vmcb control field.
However, NRIP support itself depends on cpuid Fn8000_000A_EDX[NRIPS].
Since skip_emulated_instruction() doesn't verify nrip support
before accepting control.next_rip as valid, avoid writing this
field if support isn't present.
