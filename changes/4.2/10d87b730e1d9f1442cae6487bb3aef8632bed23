crypto: nx - Fixing SHA update bug

Bug happens when a data size less than SHA block size is passed.
Since first attempt will be saved in buffer, second round attempt
get into two step to calculate op.inlen and op.outlen. The issue
resides in this step. A  wrong value of op.inlen and outlen was being
calculated.

This patch fix this eliminate the nx_sha_build_sg_list, that is
useless in SHA's algorithm context. Instead we call nx_build_sg_list
directly and pass a previous calculated max_sg_len to it.
