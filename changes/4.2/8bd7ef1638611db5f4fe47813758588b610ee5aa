drm/i915: Add a partial GGTT view type

Partial view type allows manipulating parts of huge BOs through the GGTT,
which was not previously possible due to constraint that whole object had
to be mapped for any access to it through GGTT.

v2:
- Retain error value from sg_alloc_table (Tvrtko Ursulin)
- Do not zero already zeroed variable (Tvrtko Ursulin)
- Use more common variable types for page size/offset (Tvrtko Ursulin)
v3:
- Only compare additional view parameters when need to (Tvrtko Ursulin)
v4:
- Do zero out the variable that needs to be (bug introduced in v2).
