suspend-to-idle: Prevent RCU from complaining about tick_freeze()

Put tick_freeze() under RCU_NONIDLE() to prevent RCU from complaining
about suspicious RCU usage in idle by trace_suspend_resume() called
from there.

While at it, fix a comment related to another usage of RCU_NONIDLE()
in enter_freeze_proper().
