seqcount: Rename write_seqcount_barrier()

I'll shortly be introducing another seqcount primitive that's useful
to provide ordering semantics and would like to use the
write_seqcount_barrier() name for that.

Seeing how there's only one user of the current primitive, lets rename
it to invalidate, as that appears what its doing.

While there, employ lockdep_assert_held() instead of
assert_spin_locked() to not generate debug code for regular kernels.
