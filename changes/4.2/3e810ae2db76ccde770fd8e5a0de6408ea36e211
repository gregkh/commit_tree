mm/slub: allow merging when SLAB_DEBUG_FREE is set

This patch fixes creation of new kmem-caches after enabling
sanity_checks for existing mergeable kmem-caches in runtime: before that
patch creation fails because unique name in sysfs already taken by
existing kmem-cache.

Unlike other debug options this doesn't change object layout and could
be enabled and disabled at any time.
