fm10k: re-map all possible VF queues after a VFLR

During initialization, the VF counts its rings by walking the TQDLOC
registers. This works only if the TQMAP/RQMAP registers are set to map
all of the out-of-bound rings back to the first one. This allows the VF
to cleanly detect when it has run out of queues. Update the PF code so
that it resets the empty TQMAP/RQMAP registers post-VFLR to prevent
innocent VF drivers from triggering malicious driver events.
