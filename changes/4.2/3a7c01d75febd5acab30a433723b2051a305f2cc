ARM: dts: Add Odroid XU3 Lite support

The Odroid XU3 Lite is almost the same as XU3, except:
1. Lower CPU frequencies (1.8 GHz for A15 and 1.3 GHz for A7, instead of
   2.0 GHz and 1.4 GHz).
2. No DisplayPort.
3. No TI INA231 energy measurement sensors.

This patch moves common nodes (which is almost everything) to a common
DTSI file and adds a new XU3 Lite DTS.

Currently in comparison to XU3, only the INA231 sensors are disabled to
remove the warning:
ina2xx 0-0040: error configuring the device: -6
