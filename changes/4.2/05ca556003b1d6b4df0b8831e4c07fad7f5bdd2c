device property: Introduces device_dma_is_coherent()

Currently, device drivers, which support both OF and ACPI,
need to call two separate APIs, of_dma_is_coherent() and
acpi_dma_is_coherent()) to determine device coherency attribute.

This patch simplifies this process by introducing a new device
property API, device_dma_is_coherent(), which calls the appropriate
interface based on the booting architecture.
