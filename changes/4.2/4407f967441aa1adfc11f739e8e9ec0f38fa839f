perf tools: Copy rbtree.h from the kernel

We were using the include/linux/rbtree.h directly from the kernel,
which broke the build as soon as it started using rcupdate.h, to
avoid dragging the rcu header files into tools/, for which there is
no use so far, grab a copy of rbtree.h.

This is the minimal fix, later patches will copy as well lib/rbtree.c
and move rbtree.h into tools/include/, etc.
