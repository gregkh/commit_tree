ASoC: rsnd: don't care under/over run error when PIO

PIO is used only for checking data path / codec settings. And underrun
is very normal when PIO mode. Let's don't care about under/over run
error when PIO case. Otherwise, 1) too many HW restart happens, 2) some
sounds which need much data transfer can't play since it falls into
error detection method which was created for DMA transfer
