ARM: imx6: gpc: always enable PU domain if CONFIG_PM is not set

If CONFIG_PM is not set the PU power domain needs to be enabled always,
otherwise there are two failure scenarios which will hang the system if
one of the devices in the PU domain is accessed.

1. New DTs (4.1+) drop the "always-on" property from the PU regulator, so
if it isn't properly enabled by the GPC code it will be disabled at the
end of boot.

2. If the bootloader already disabled the PU domain the GPC explicitly
needs to enable it again, even if the kernel doesn't do any power
management. This is a bit hypothetical, as it requires to boot a
mainline kernel on a downstream bootloader, as no mainline bootloader
disables the PM domains.
