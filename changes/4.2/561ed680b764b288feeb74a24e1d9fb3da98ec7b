ASoC: dapm: Add support for autodisable mux controls

Commit 57295073b6ac ("ASoC: dapm: Implement mixer input auto-disable")
added support for autodisable controls, controls whose values are only
written to the hardware when their respective widgets are powered up.
But it only added support for controls based on the mixer abstraction.

This patch add support for mux controls (DAPM controls based on the
enum abstraction) to be auto-disabled as well. As each mux can only have
a single control, there is no need to tie the autodisable widget to the
inputs (as is done for the mixer controls) it can be tided directly to
the mux widget itself.

Note that it is assumed that the first entry in a autodisable mux
control will always represent the off state for the mux and is what the
mux will be set to whilst it is disabled.
