powerpc/powernv: Do not set "read" flag if direction==DMA_NONE

Normally a bitmap from the iommu_table is used to track what TCE entry
is in use. Since we are going to use iommu_table without its locks and
do xchg() instead, it becomes essential not to put bits which are not
implied in the direction flag as the old TCE value (more precisely -
the permission bits) will be used to decide whether to put the page or not.

This adds iommu_direction_to_tce_perm() (its counterpart is there already)
and uses it for powernv's pnv_tce_build().
