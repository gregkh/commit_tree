ALSA: fireworks/firewire-lib: add support for recent firmware quirk

Fireworks uses TSB43CB43(IceLynx-Micro) as its IEC 61883-1/6 interface.
This chip includes ARM7 core, and loads and runs program. The firmware
is stored in on-board memory and loaded every powering-on from it.

Echo Audio ships several versions of firmwares for each model. These
firmwares have each quirk and the quirk changes a sequence of packets.

As long as I investigated, AudioFire2/AudioFire4/AudioFirePre8 have a
quirk to transfer a first packet with 0x02 in its dbc field. This causes
ALSA Fireworks driver to detect discontinuity. In this case, firmware
version 5.7.0, 5.7.3 and 5.8.0 are used.

snd-fireworks fw1.0: Detect discontinuity of CIP: 00 02

These models, AudioFire8 (since Jul 2009 ) and Gibson Robot Interface
Pack series uses the same ARM binary as their firmware. Thus, this
quirk may be observed among them.

This commit adds a new member for AMDTP structure. This member represents
the value of dbc field in a first AMDTP packet. Drivers can set it with
a preferred value according to model's quirk.
