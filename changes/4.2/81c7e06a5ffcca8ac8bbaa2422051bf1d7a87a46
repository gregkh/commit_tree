scsi: ufs-qcom: don't enable interrupt aggregation

Current versions of UFS host controllers on QUALCOMM Technologies
have interrupt aggregation logic broken.
Interrupt aggregation may not work if both threshold count and timeout
is enabled. Hence disable interrupt aggregation by enabling
UFSHCD_QUIRK_BROKEN_INTR_AGGR quirk until its fixed in the newer
UFS host controller revisions.
