target: simplify backend driver registration

Rewrite the backend driver registration based on what we did to the fabric
drivers:  introduce a read-only struct target_bakckend_ops that the driver
registers, which is then instanciate as a struct target_backend by the
core.  This allows the ops vector to be smaller and allows us to mark it
const.  At the same time the registration function can set up the
configfs attributes, avoiding the need to add additional boilerplate code
for that to the drivers.
