jbd2: revert must-not-fail allocation loops back to GFP_NOFAIL

This basically reverts 47def82672b3 (jbd2: Remove __GFP_NOFAIL from jbd2
layer). The deprecation of __GFP_NOFAIL was a bad choice because it led
to open coding the endless loop around the allocator rather than
removing the dependency on the non failing allocation. So the
deprecation was a clear failure and the reality tells us that
__GFP_NOFAIL is not even close to go away.

It is still true that __GFP_NOFAIL allocations are generally discouraged
and new uses should be evaluated and an alternative (pre-allocations or
reservations) should be considered but it doesn't make any sense to lie
the allocator about the requirements. Allocator can take steps to help
making a progress if it knows the requirements.
