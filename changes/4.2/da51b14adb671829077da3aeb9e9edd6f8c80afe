mm: oom_kill: remove unnecessary locking in exit_oom_victim()

Disabling the OOM killer needs to exclude allocators from entering, not
existing victims from exiting.

Right now the only waiter is suspend code, which achieves quiescence by
disabling the OOM killer.  But later on we want to add waits that hold
the lock instead to stop new victims from showing up.
