USB: ehci-platform: support EHCIs with transaction translator

Some EHCI controllers have a Transaction Translator built into
the root hub. Support this feature in device tree when using
the ehci-platform driver by adding a feature flag for it.

This is needed to get USB working on NXP LPC18xx/43xx platforms.
