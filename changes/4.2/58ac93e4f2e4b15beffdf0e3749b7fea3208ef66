sched: Fix function declaration return type mismatch

static code checking was unhappy with:

  ./kernel/sched/fair.c:162 WARNING: return of wrong type
                int != unsigned int

get_update_sysctl_factor() is declared to return int but is
currently  returning an unsigned int. The first few preprocessed
lines are:

 static int get_update_sysctl_factor(void)
 {
 unsigned int cpus = ({ int __min1 = (cpumask_weight(cpu_online_mask));
 int __min2 = (8); __min1 < __min2 ? __min1: __min2; });
 unsigned int factor;

The type used by min_t() should be 'unsigned int' and the return type
of get_update_sysctl_factor() should also be 'unsigned int' as its
call-site update_sysctl() is expecting 'unsigned int' and the values
utilizing:

  'factor'
  'sysctl_sched_min_granularity'
  'sched_nr_latency'
  'sysctl_sched_wakeup_granularity'

... are also all 'unsigned int', plus cpumask_weight() is also
returning 'unsigned int'.

So the natural type to use around here is 'unsigned int'.

( Patch was compile tested with x86_64_defconfig +
  CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y and the changed sections in
  kernel/sched/fair.i were reviewed. )
