xen/netback: Wake dealloc thread after completing zerocopy work

Waking the dealloc thread before decrementing inflight_packets is racy
because it means the thread may go to sleep before inflight_packets is
decremented. If kthread_stop() has already been called, the dealloc
thread may wait forever with nothing to wake it. Instead, wake the
thread only after decrementing inflight_packets.
