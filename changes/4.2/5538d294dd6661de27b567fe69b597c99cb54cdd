treewide: Add missing vmalloc.h inclusion.

All of these files were only building on non-x86 because of
the indirect of inclusion of vmalloc.h by, of all things,
"net/inet_hashtables.h"

None of this got caught during build testing, because on x86
there is an implicit vmalloc.h include via on of the arch asm/
headers.

This fixes all of these
