ASoC: wm_adsp: Split out adsp1 & 2 setup algorithms

The vast majority of the wm_adsp_setup_algs function is case statements
for ADSP1 or ADSP2, this patch splits this out into two separate
functions wm_adsp1_setup_algs and wm_adsp2_setup_algs. The small amount
of shared code between them is factored out into an extra helper
function. This makes the code a lot cleaner.
