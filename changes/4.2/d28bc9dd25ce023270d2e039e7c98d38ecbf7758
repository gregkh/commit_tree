KVM: x86: INIT and reset sequences are different

x86 architecture defines differences between the reset and INIT sequences.
INIT does not initialize the FPU (including MMX, XMM, YMM, etc.), TSC, PMU,
MSRs (in general), MTRRs machine-check, APIC ID, APIC arbitration ID and BSP.

References (from Intel SDM):

"If the MP protocol has completed and a BSP is chosen, subsequent INITs (either
to a specific processor or system wide) do not cause the MP protocol to be
repeated." [8.4.2: MP Initialization Protocol Requirements and Restrictions]

[Table 9-1. IA-32 Processor States Following Power-up, Reset, or INIT]

"If the processor is reset by asserting the INIT# pin, the x87 FPU state is not
changed." [9.2: X87 FPU INITIALIZATION]

"The state of the local APIC following an INIT reset is the same as it is after
a power-up or hardware reset, except that the APIC ID and arbitration ID
registers are not affected." [10.4.7.3: Local APIC State After an INIT Reset
("Wait-for-SIPI" State)]
