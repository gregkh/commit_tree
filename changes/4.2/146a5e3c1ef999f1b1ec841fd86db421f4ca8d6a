With this patch, ALSA BeBoB driver can start packet streaming to/from
this model, while as a default, internal multiplexer of this model is
not initialized and generates no sound even if the driver transfers
any packets with PCM samples. To hear any sounds from this model,
userspace applications should be developed to set parameters to the
internal multiplexer. You can see raw information in FFADO website:
