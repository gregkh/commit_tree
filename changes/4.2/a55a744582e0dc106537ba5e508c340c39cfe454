ARM: OMAP3: Fix crypto support for HS devices

Register crypto hwmod links only if they are not disabled in DT.
If DT information is missing, enable them only for GP devices.

Before this patch crypto hwmod links were always disabled for all HS
devices and it was not possible to use omap-aes and omap-sham linux
drivers.
