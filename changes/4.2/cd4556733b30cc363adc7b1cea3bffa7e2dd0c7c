ARM: dts: dra7: Fix broken pbias device creation

commit <d919501feffa> ("ARM: dts: dra7: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support") moved pbias_regulator dt node
from being a child node of ocp to be the child node of
scm_conf. After this device for pbias_regulator is
not created.

Fix it by adding "simple-bus" compatible property to
scm_conf dt node.

layout with control module support")
