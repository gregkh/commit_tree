iwlwifi: mvm: revert order of SSIDs for sched scans

The firmware inverts the order of the SSIDs sent out in probe requests
(for some reason).  For regular scans, we've been passing the SSIDs in
the opposite order so they go out in the order we want.  With
scheduled scans, we were not doing that, so they were sent out in
reverse order of priority.  Fix that by using the reverse order when
populating the SSIDs array for scheduled scans as well.
