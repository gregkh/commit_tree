Input: usbtouchscreen - avoid unresponsive TSC-30 touch screen

This patch fixes a problem in the usbtouchscreen driver for DMC TSC-30
touch screen.  Due to a missing delay between the RESET and SET_RATE
commands, the touch screen may become unresponsive during system startup or
driver loading.

According to the DMC documentation, a delay is needed after the RESET
command to allow the chip to complete its internal initialization. As this
delay is not guaranteed, we had a system where the touch screen
occasionally did not send any touch data. There was no other indication of
the problem.

The patch fixes the problem by adding a 150ms delay between the RESET and
SET_RATE commands.
