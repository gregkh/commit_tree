mm/page_owner: set correct gfp_mask on page_owner

Currently, we set wrong gfp_mask to page_owner info in case of isolated
freepage by compaction and split page.  It causes incorrect mixed
pageblock report that we can get from '/proc/pagetypeinfo'.  This metric
is really useful to measure fragmentation effect so should be accurate.
This patch fixes it by setting correct information.

Without this patch, after kernel build workload is finished, number of
mixed pageblock is 112 among roughly 210 movable pageblocks.

But, with this fix, output shows that mixed pageblock is just 57.
