ixgbe: Allow flow director to use entire queue space

Flow director is exported to user space using the ethtool ntuple
support. However, currently it only supports steering traffic to a
subset of the queues in use by the hardware. This change allows
flow director to specify queues that have been assigned to virtual
functions by partitioning the ring_cookie into a 8bit VF specifier
followed by 32bit queue index. At the moment we don't have any
ethernet drivers with more than 2^32 queues on a single function
as best I can tell and nor do I expect this to happen anytime
soon. This way the ring_cookie's normal use for specifying a queue
on a specific PCI function continues to work as expected.
