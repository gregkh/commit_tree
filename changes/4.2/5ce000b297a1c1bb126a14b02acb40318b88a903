ALSA: hda - Add pin quirk for the headset mic jack detection on Dell laptop

The new Dell laptop with codec 256 can't detect headset mic when
headset was inserted on the machine. From alsa-info, we check
init_pin_configs and need to define the new register value for pin
0x1d & 0x1e because the original macro ALC256_STANDARD_PINS can't
match pin definition. Also, the macro ALC256_STANDARD_PINS is
simplified by removing them. This makes headset mic works on laptop.

Codec: Realtek ALC256
