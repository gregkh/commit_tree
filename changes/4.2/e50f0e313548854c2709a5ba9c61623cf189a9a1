MIPS: hazards: Add hazard macros for tlb read

Add hazard macros to <asm/hazards.h> for the following hazards around
tlbr (TLB read) instructions, which are used in TLB dumping code and
some KVM TLB management code:

- mtc0_tlbr_hazard
  Between mtc0 (Index) and tlbr. This is copied from mtc0_tlbw_hazard in
  all cases on the assumption that tlbr always has similar data user
  timings to tlbw.

- tlb_read_hazard
  Between tlbr and mfc0 (various TLB registers). This is copied from
  tlbw_use_hazard in all cases on the assumption that tlbr has similar
  data writer characteristics to tlbw, and mfc0 has similar data user
  characteristics to loads and stores.
