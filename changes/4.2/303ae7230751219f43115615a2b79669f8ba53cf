cpufreq: Clear policy->cpus even for the last CPU

We clear policy->cpus mask while CPUs are hotplugged out. We do it for all CPUs
except the last CPU of the policy. I don't remember what the rationale behind
that was, but I couldn't think of anything that will break if we remove this
conditional clearing and always clear policy->cpus.

The benefit we get out of it is, we can know if a policy is active or not by
checking if this field is empty or not. That will be used by later commits.
