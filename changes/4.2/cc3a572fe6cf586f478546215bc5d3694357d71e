netlink: rename private flags and states

These flags and states have the same prefix (NETLINK_) that netlink socket
options. To avoid confusion and to be able to name a flag like a socket
option, let's use an other prefix: NETLINK_[S|F]_.

Note: a comment has been fixed, it was talking about
NETLINK_RECV_NO_ENOBUFS socket option instead of NETLINK_NO_ENOBUFS.
