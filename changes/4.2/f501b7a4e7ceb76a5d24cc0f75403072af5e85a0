ASoC: rsnd: add common interrupt handler for SSI/SRC/DMA

Each Renesas sound mod (= SSI/SRC/DVC) might be called from many paths
if it supports MIXer. In such case, mod <-> io is no longer 1:1
relationship. Then, interrupt handler can't use rsnd_mod_to_io().
This patch adds SSI/SRC/DMA common interrupt handler frame
