parisc: mm: Fix a memory leak related to pmd not attached to the pgd

Commit 0e0da48dee8d ("parisc: mm: don't count preallocated pmds")
introduced a memory leak.

After this commit, the 'return' statement in pmd_free is executed in all
cases. Even for pmd that are not attached to the pgd.  So 'free_pages'
can never be called anymore, leading to a memory leak.
