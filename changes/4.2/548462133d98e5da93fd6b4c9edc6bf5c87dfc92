ath10k: fix interrupt storm

Promiscuous mode is enabled when wlan interface is added to
bridge. ath10k creates a monitor mode when promiscuous mode
is enabled. When monitor vdev is running along with other
vdev(s) there is a huge number of interrupts generated
especially in noisy condition. Fix this by not enabling
promiscuous(monitor) mode when already a vdev is running.
As disabling promiscuous mode may have issues with 4-address
bridging in STA mode, the change is done specific to non-sta/ibss
mode types. This does not change the support of virtual interface of
type monitor along with other vdevs of any type.

This could fix management frame drop in fw due to unavailable
buffers because in monitor mode device receives everything seen
on the air. In noisy condition, disabling monitor mode helps assoc
go through without any issue.
