vfs, writeback: replace FS_CGROUP_WRITEBACK with SB_I_CGROUPWB

FS_CGROUP_WRITEBACK indicates whether a file_system_type supports
cgroup writeback; however, different super_blocks of the same
file_system_type may or may not support cgroup writeback depending on
filesystem options.  This patch replaces FS_CGROUP_WRITEBACK with a
per-super_block flag.

super_block->s_flags carries some internal flags in the high bits but
it's exposd to userland through uapi header and running out of space
anyway.  This patch adds a new field super_block->s_iflags to carry
kernel-internal flags.  It is currently only used by the new
SB_I_CGROUPWB flag whose concatenated and abbreviated name is for
consistency with other super_block flags.

ext2_fill_super() is updated to set SB_I_CGROUPWB.

v2: Added super_block->s_iflags instead of stealing another high bit
    from sb->s_flags as suggested by Christoph and Jan.
