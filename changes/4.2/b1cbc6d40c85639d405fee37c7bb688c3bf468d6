writeback: make __wb_calc_thresh() take dirty_throttle_control

wb_calc_thresh() calculates wb_thresh by scaling thresh according to
the wb's portion in the system-wide write bandwidth.  cgroup writeback
support would need to calculate wb_thresh against memcg domain too.
This patch renames wb_calc_thresh() to __wb_calc_thresh() and makes it
take dirty_throttle_control so that the function can later be updated
to calculate against different domains according to
dirty_throttle_control.

wb_calc_thresh() is now a thin wrapper around __wb_calc_thresh().

v2: The original version was incorrectly scaling dtc->dirty instead of
    dtc->thresh.  This was due to the extremely confusing function and
    variable names.  Added a rename patch and fixed this one.
