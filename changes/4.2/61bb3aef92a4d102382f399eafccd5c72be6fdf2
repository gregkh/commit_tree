sh-pfc: fix sparse GPIOs for R-Car SoCs

The PFC driver causes the kernel to hang on the R-Car gen2 SoC based  boards
when the CPU_ALL_PORT() macro is fixed to reflect the reality, i.e. when the
GPIO space becomes actually sparse.  This happens because the _GP_GPIO() macro
includes  an indexed initializer which causes the "holes" (array entries filled
with all 0s) between the groups  of the existing GPIOs; and the driver can't
cope with that.  There seems to  be no reason to use the indexed initializer,
so we can remove the index specifier and so avoid the "holes".
