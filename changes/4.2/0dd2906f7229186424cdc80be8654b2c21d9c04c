Btrfs: sysfs: let default_attrs be separate from the kset

As of now btrfs_attrs are provided using the default_attrs through
the kset. Separate them and create the default_attrs using the
sysfs_create_files instead. By doing this we will have the
flexibility that device discovery thread could create fsid
kobject.
