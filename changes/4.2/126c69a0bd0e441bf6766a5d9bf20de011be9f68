arm64: KVM: Fix host crash when injecting a fault into a 32bit guest

When injecting a fault into a misbehaving 32bit guest, it seems
rather idiotic to also inject a 64bit fault that is only going
to corrupt the guest state. This leads to a situation where we
perform an illegal exception return at EL2 causing the host
to crash instead of killing the guest.

Just fix the stupid bug that has been there from day 1.
