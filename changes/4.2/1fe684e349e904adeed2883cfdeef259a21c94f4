perf/x86/intel: Remove pointless tests

Both intel_commit_scheduling() and intel_get_excl_contraints() test
for cntr < 0.

The only way that can happen (aside from a bug) is through
validate_event(), however that is already captured by the
cpuc->is_fake test.

So remove these test and simplify the code.
