powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Add TCE invalidation for all attached groups

The iommu_table struct keeps a list of IOMMU groups it is used for.
At the moment there is just a single group attached but further
patches will add TCE table sharing. When sharing is enabled, TCE cache
in each PE needs to be invalidated so does the patch.

This does not change pnv_pci_ioda1_tce_invalidate() as there is no plan
to enable TCE table sharing on PHBs older than IODA2.
