x86/mpx: Add temporary variable to reduce masking

When we allocate a bounds table, we call mmap(), then add a
"valid" bit to the value before storing it in to the bounds
directory.

If we fail along the way, we go and mask that valid bit
_back_ out.  That seems a little silly, and this makes it
much more clear when we have a plain address versus an
actual table _entry_.
