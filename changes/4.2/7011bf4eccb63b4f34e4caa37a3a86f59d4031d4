ACPICA: Linuxize: Replace __FUNCTION__ with __func__

ACPICA commit cb3d1c79f862cd368d749c9b8d9dced40111b0d0

__FUNCTION__ is MSVC only, in Linux, it is __func__. Lv Zheng.

As noted by Christoph Hellwig: "__func__ is in C99 and never.
__FUNCTION__ is an old extension supported by various compilers."

In ACPICA, this is achieved by string replacement in release script and
this patch contains the source code difference between the Linux upstream
and ACPICA that is caused by the back porting.
