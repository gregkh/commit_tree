fbdev: select versatile helpers for the integrator

Commit 11c32d7b6274cb0f554943d65bd4a126c4a86dcd
"video: move Versatile CLCD helpers" missed the fact
that the Integrator/CP is also using the helper, and
as a result the platform got only stubs and no graphics.
Add this as a default selection to Kconfig so we have
graphics again.
