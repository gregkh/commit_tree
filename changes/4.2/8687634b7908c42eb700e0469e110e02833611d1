tty/serial: at91: RS485 mode: 0 is valid for delay_rts_after_send

In RS485 mode, we may want to set the delay_rts_after_send value to 0.
In the datasheet, the 0 value is said to "disable" the Transmitter Timeguard but
this is exactly the expected behavior if we want no delay...

Moreover, if the value was set to non-zero value by device-tree or earlier
ioctl command, it was impossible to change it back to zero.
