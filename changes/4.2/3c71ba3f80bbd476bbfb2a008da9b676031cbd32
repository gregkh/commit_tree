perf tools: Really allow to specify custom CC, AR or LD

Commit 5ef7bbb09f7b ("perf tools: Allow to specify custom linker
command") was meant to enable usage non $(CROSS_COMPILE)ld linker during
perf building.

But implementation didn't take into account the fact that LD is a
pre-defined variable in GNU Make. I.e. it is always defined.

Which means there's no point to check "LD ?= ..." because it will never
succeed.

And so LD will be either that explicitly passed to make like this:

 ------->8-------
 make LD=path_to_my_ld ...
 ------->8-------
 or default value, which is host's "ld".

Latter leads to failure of cross-linkage because instead of cross linker
"$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld" host's "ld" is used.

Fortunately there's a way to do correct substitution of $(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
with user defined LD on command-line.

As a reference was used implementation in "tools/lib/traceevent/Makefile".

Build tested for x86_64 and ARC.

Thanks Jiri for this hint.
