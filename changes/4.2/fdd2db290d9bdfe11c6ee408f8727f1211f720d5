snsc: pass timeout as HZ independent value

schedule_timeout takes a timeout in jiffies but the code currently is
passing in a constant SCDRV_TIMEOUT which makes this timeout HZ
dependent, so pass it through msecs_to_jiffies() to fix this up.

patch was compile tested with generic_defconfig (implies CONFIG_SGI_SNSC=y)

Patch is against 4.0-rc5 (localversion-next is -next-20150527)
