brcmfmac: fix invalid access to struct acpi_device fields

The fields of struct acpi_device are only known when CONFIG_ACPI is
defined. Fix this by using a helper function. This will resolve the
issue found in linux-next:

 ../brcmfmac/bcmsdh.c: In function 'brcmf_ops_sdio_probe':
 ../brcmfmac/bcmsdh.c:1139:7: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
   adev->flags.power_manageable = 0;
       ^

Fixes: f0992ace680c ("brcmfmac: prohibit ACPI power management ...")
