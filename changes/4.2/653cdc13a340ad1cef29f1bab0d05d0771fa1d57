USB: qcserial/option: make AT URCs work for Sierra Wireless MC7305/MC7355

Tests with a Sierra Wireless MC7355 have shown that 1199:9041 devices
also require the option_send_setup() code to be used on the USB
interface for the AT port to make unsolicited response codes work
correctly. Move these devices from the qcserial driver to the option
driver like it has been done for the 1199:68c0 devices in commit
d80c0d14183516f184a5ac88e11008ee4c7d2a2e ("USB: qcserial/option: make
AT URCs work for Sierra Wireless MC73xx").
