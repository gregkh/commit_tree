x86/mm/mtrr: Clean up mtrr_type_lookup()

MTRRs contain fixed and variable entries. mtrr_type_lookup() may
repeatedly call __mtrr_type_lookup() to handle a request that
overlaps with variable entries.

However, __mtrr_type_lookup() also handles the fixed entries,
which do not have to be repeated. Therefore, this patch creates
separate functions, mtrr_type_lookup_fixed() and
mtrr_type_lookup_variable(), to handle the fixed and variable
ranges respectively.

The patch also updates the function headers to clarify the
return values and output argument. It updates comments to
clarify that the repeating is necessary to handle overlaps with
the default type, since overlaps with multiple entries alone can
be handled without such repeating.

There is no functional change in this patch.
