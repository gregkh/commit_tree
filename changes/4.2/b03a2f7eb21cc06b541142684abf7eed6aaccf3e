ext4: improve warning directory handling messages

Several ext4_warning() messages in the directory handling code do not
report the inode number of the (potentially corrupt) directory where a
problem is seen, and others report this in an ad-hoc manner.  Add an
ext4_warning_inode() helper to print the inode number and command name
consistent with ext4_error_inode().

Consolidate the place in ext4.h that these macros are defined.

Clean up some other directory error and warning messages to print the
calling function name.

Minor code style fixes in nearby lines.
