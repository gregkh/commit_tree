w1: Add support for DS28EA00 sequence to w1-therm

This patch provides support for the DS28EA00 digital thermometer.

The DS28EA00 provides an additional two pins for implementing a sequence
detection algorithm.  This feature allows you to determine the physical
location of the chip in the 1-wire bus without needing pre-existing
knowledge of the bus ordering.  Support is provided through the sysfs
w1_seq file.  The file will contain a single line with an integer value
representing the device index in the bus starting at 0.
