btrfs: add 'cold' compiler annotations to all error handling functions

The annotated functios will be placed into .text.unlikely section. The
annotation also hints compiler to move the code out of the hot paths,
and may implicitly mark if-statement leading to that block as unlikely.

This is a heuristic, the impact on the generated code is not
significant.
