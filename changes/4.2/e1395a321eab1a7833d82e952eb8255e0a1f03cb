drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c: fix misleading indentation in uli526x_timer

This code in drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c
function "uli526x_timer":

  1086          } else
  1087                  if ((tmp_cr12 & 0x3) && db->link_failed) {
  [...snip...]
  1109                  }
  1110                  else if(!(tmp_cr12 & 0x3) && db->link_failed)
  1111                  {
  [...snip...]
  1117                  }
  1118                  db->init=0;

is misleadingly indented: the
  db->init=0
is indented as if part of the else clause at line 1086, but it is
independent of it (no braces before the "if" at line 1087).

This patch fixes the indentation to reflect the actual meaning of the code,
though is it actually meant to be part of the "else" clause?  (I'm a
compiler developer, not a kernel person).  It also adds spaces around
the assignment, to placate checkpatch.pl.

Seen via an experimental new gcc warning I'm working on for gcc 6,
-Wmisleading-indentation, using gcc r223098 adding
-Werror=misleading-indentation to KBUILD_CFLAGS in Makefile.
The experimental GCC emits this warning (as an error), rightly IMHO:

drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c: In function ‘uli526x_timer’:
drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c:1118:3: error: statement is
indented as if it were guarded by... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
   db->init=0;
    ^
drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c:1086:4: note: ...this ‘else’
clause, but it is not
  } else
     ^

Hope this is helpful
