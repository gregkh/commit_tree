ARM: exynos_defconfig: savedefconfig

This patch does 'savedefconfig' for exynos_defconfig to remove useless
configs and check its dependencies. Sometimes some configs could be
ignored because of the dependencies even they are enabled in defconfig
file manually. So checking the dependencies would be better.
