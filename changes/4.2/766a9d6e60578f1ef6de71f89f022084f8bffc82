writeback: implement backing_dev_info->tot_write_bandwidth

cgroup writeback support needs to keep track of the sum of
avg_write_bandwidth of all wb's (bdi_writeback's) with dirty inodes to
distribute write workload.  This patch adds bdi->tot_write_bandwidth
and updates inode_wb_list_move_locked(), inode_wb_list_del_locked()
and wb_update_write_bandwidth() to adjust it as wb's gain and lose
dirty inodes and its avg_write_bandwidth gets updated.

As the update events are not synchronized with each other,
bdi->tot_write_bandwidth is an atomic_long_t.
