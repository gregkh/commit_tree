xfs: xfs_alloc_fix_freelist() can use incore perag structures

At the moment, xfs_alloc_fix_freelist() uses a mix of per-ag based
access and agf buffer  based access to freelist and space usage
information. However, once the AGF buffer is locked inside this
function, it is guaranteed that both the in-memory and on-disk
values are identical. xfs_alloc_fix_freelist() doesn't modify the
values in the structures directly, so it is a read-only user of the
infomration, and hence can use the per-ag structure exclusively for
determining what it should do.

This opens up an avenue for cleaning up a lot of duplicated logic
whose only difference is the structure it gets the data from, and in
doing so removes a lot of needless byte swapping overhead when
fixing up the free list.
