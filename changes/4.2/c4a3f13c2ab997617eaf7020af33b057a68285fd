mtd: blktrans: use better error code for unimplemented ioctl()

In commit 50183936254b ("mtd: blktrans: change blktrans_getgeo return
value") we fixed the problem that ioctl(HDIO_GETGEO) might return 0
(success) for mtdblock devices which did not implement the feature and
would leave a blank (zero) result.

But now, let's get the error code right. Other code paths on this ioctl
tend to use -ENOTTY to notify the user that the ioctl() is not supported
for the device, so let's use that instead of -EOPNOTSUPP.
