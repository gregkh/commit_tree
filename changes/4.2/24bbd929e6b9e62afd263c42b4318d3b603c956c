of/fdt: split off FDT self reservation from memreserve processing

This splits off the reservation of the memory occupied by the FDT
binary itself from the processing of the memory reservations it
contains. This is necessary because the physical address of the FDT,
which is needed to perform the reservation, may not be known to the
FDT driver core, i.e., it may be mapped outside the linear direct
mapping, in which case __pa() returns a bogus value.
