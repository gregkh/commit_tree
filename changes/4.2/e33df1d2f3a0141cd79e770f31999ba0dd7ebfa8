thermal: let governors have private data for each thermal zone

A governor may need to store its current state between calls to
throttle().  That state depends on the thermal zone, so store it as
private data in struct thermal_zone_device.

The governors may have two new ops: bind_to_tz() and unbind_from_tz().
When provided, these functions let governors do some initialization
and teardown when they are bound/unbound to a tz and possibly store that
information in the governor_data field of the struct
thermal_zone_device.
