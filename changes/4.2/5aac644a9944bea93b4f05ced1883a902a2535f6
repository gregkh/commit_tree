x86/tsc: Let high latency PIT fail fast in quick_pit_calibrate()

If it takes longer than 12us to read the PIT counter lsb/msb,
then the error margin will never fall below 500ppm within 50ms,
and Fast TSC calibration will always fail.

This patch detects when that will happen and fails fast. Note
the failure message is not printed in that case because:
1. it will always happen on that class of hardware
2. the absence of the message is more informative than its
presence
