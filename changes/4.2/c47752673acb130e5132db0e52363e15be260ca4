fuse: don't hold lock over request_wait_answer()

Only hold fc->lock over sections of request_wait_answer() that actually
need it.  If wait_event_interruptible() returns zero, it means that the
request finished.  Need to add memory barriers, though, to make sure that
all relevant data in the request is synchronized.
