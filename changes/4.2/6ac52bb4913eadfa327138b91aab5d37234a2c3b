x86/mpx: Use 32-bit-only cmpxchg() for 32-bit apps

user_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() actually looks at sizeof(*ptr) to
figure out how many bytes to copy.  If we run it on a 64-bit
kernel with a 64-bit pointer, it will copy a 64-bit bounds
directory entry.  That's fine, except when we have 32-bit
programs with 32-bit bounds directory entries and we only *want*
32-bits.

This patch breaks the cmpxchg() operation out in to its own
function and performs the 32-bit type swizzling in there.

Note, the "64-bit" version of this code _would_ work on a
32-bit-only kernel.  The issue this patch addresses is only for
when the kernel's 'long' is mismatched from the size of the
bounds directory entry of the process we are working on.

The new helper modifies 'actual_old_val' or returns an error.
But gcc doesn't know this, so it warns about 'actual_old_val'
being unused.  Shut it up with an uninitialized_var().
