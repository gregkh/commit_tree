arm64: use fixmap region for permanent FDT mapping

Currently, the FDT blob needs to be in the same 512 MB region as
the kernel, so that it can be mapped into the kernel virtual memory
space very early on using a minimal set of statically allocated
translation tables.

Now that we have early fixmap support, we can relax this restriction,
by moving the permanent FDT mapping to the fixmap region instead.
This way, the FDT blob may be anywhere in memory.

This also moves the vetting of the FDT to mmu.c, since the early
init code in head.S does not handle mapping of the FDT anymore.
At the same time, fix up some comments in head.S that have gone stale.
