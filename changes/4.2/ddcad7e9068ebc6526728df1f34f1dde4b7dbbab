spi: omap2-mcspi: Fix native cs with new set_cs

GPIO chip select patch series appears to have broken the native chip select
support. This patch pulls the manual native chip select toggling out of
the transfer_one routine and adds a set_cs routine.

Tested natively on AM3354 with SPI serial flash on spi0cs0.
