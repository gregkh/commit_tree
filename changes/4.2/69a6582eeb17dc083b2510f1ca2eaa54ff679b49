regulator: arizona-ldo1: Do not control DVFS clocking from regulator

Using the driver for the internal regulator to also enable/disable
the codec internal clock frequency controller is an unexpected
side-effect for a regulator, and also means that the core clocks
won't be changed as expected if an external regulator is used to
power the codec.

The DVFS is now handled by the codec driver so can be removed from
the LDO1 driver.
