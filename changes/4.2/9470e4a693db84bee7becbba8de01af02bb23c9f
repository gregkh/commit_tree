cfq-iosched: fix sysfs oops when attempting to read unconfigured weights

If none of the devices in the system are using CFQ, then attempting to
read:

/sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/blkio.leaf_weight

will results in a NULL dereference. Check for a valid cfq_group_data
struct before attempting to dereference it.
