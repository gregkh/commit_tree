ARM64: kernel: unify ACPI and DT cpus initialization

The code that initializes cpus on arm64 is currently split in two
different code paths that carry out DT and ACPI cpus initialization.

Most of the code executing SMP initialization is common and should
be merged to reduce discrepancies between ACPI and DT initialization
and to have code initializing cpus in a single common place in the
kernel.

This patch refactors arm64 SMP cpus initialization code to merge
ACPI and DT boot paths in a common file and to create sanity
checks that can be reused by both boot methods.

Current code assumes PSCI is the only available boot method
when arm64 boots with ACPI; this can be easily extended if/when
the ACPI parking protocol is merged into the kernel.
