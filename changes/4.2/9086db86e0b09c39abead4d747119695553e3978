btrfs: qgroup: Add the ability to skip given qgroup for old/new_roots.

This is used by later qgroup fix patches for snapshot.

As current snapshot accounting is done by btrfs_qgroup_inherit(), but
new extent oriented quota mechanism will account extent from
btrfs_copy_root() and other snapshot things, causing wrong result.

So add this ability to handle snapshot accounting.
