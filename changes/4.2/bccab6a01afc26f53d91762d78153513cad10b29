dm cache: switch the "default" cache replacement policy from mq to smq

The Stochastic multiqueue (SMQ) policy (vs MQ) offers the promise of
less memory utilization, improved performance and increased adaptability
in the face of changing workloads.  SMQ also does not have any
cumbersome tuning knobs.

Users may switch from "mq" to "smq" simply by appropriately reloading a
DM table that is using the cache target.  Doing so will cause all of the
mq policy's hints to be dropped.  Also, performance of the cache may
degrade slightly until smq recalculates the origin device's hotspots
that should be cached.

In the future the "mq" policy will just silently make use of "smq" and
the mq code will be removed.
