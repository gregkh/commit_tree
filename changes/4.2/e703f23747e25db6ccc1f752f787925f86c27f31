staging: rtl8188eu: eliminate spaces before commas

Eliminate "space prohibited before that ','" errors found by checkpatch,
but do this only to lines which after the patch is applied do not
exceed 80 characters. Out of that only those lines are changed, whose
context does not exceed 80 characters in each line. In other words the
changes are limited to cases where the patch generated is itself
checkpatch-correct.

Rebased onto next-20150605.
