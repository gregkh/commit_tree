scsi: fix memory leak with scsi-mq

Fix a memory leak with scsi-mq triggered by commands with large data
transfer length.

__sg_alloc_table() sets both table->nents and table->orig_nents to the
same value.  When the scatterlist is DMA-mapped, table->nents is
overwritten with the (possibly smaller) size of the DMA-mapped
scatterlist, while table->orig_nents retains the original size of the
allocated scatterlist.  scsi_free_sgtable() should therefore check
orig_nents instead of nents, and all code that initializes sdb->table
without calling __sg_alloc_table() should set both nents and orig_nents.
