OMAPDSS: DISPC: fix check_horiz_timing_omap3 args

After calculating the required decimation for scaling, the dispc driver
checks once more if the resulting configuration is valid by calling
check_horiz_timing_omap3().

Earlier calls to this function have correctly used in_width and
in_height as parameters, but the last call uses width and height. This
causes the driver to possibly reject scaling that would work.

This patch fixes the parameters.
