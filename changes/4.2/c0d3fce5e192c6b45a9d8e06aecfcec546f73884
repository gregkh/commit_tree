arm64: switch_to: calculate cpu context pointer using separate register

Commit 0c8c0f03e3a2 ("x86/fpu, sched: Dynamically allocate 'struct fpu'")
moved the thread_struct to the bottom of task_struct. As a result, the
offset is now too large to be used in an immediate add on arm64 with
some kernel configs:

arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S: Assembler messages:
arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:588: Error: immediate out of range
arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:597: Error: immediate out of range

This patch calculates the offset using an additional register instead of
an immediate offset.
