drm/i915: Preserve ddi_pll_sel when allocating new pipe_config

When the modeset code is reached with a CRTC that only needs a flip, the
code that assigns PLLs is skipped. But since there is still a state swap
for that CRTC, the current PLL assignment needs to be preserved. I
missed the ddi_pll_sel field in the following commit, which causes
warnings in DDI platforms.
