Bluetooth: Fix encryption key size handling for LTKs

The encryption key size for LTKs is supposed to be applied only at the
moment of encryption. When generating a Link Key (using LE SC) from
the LTK the full non-shortened value should be used. This patch
modifies the code to always keep the full value around and only apply
the key size when passing the value to HCI.
