crypto: caam - Clamp AEAD SG list by input length

Currently caam assumes that the SG list contains exactly the number
of bytes required.  This assumption is incorrect.

Up until now this has been harmless.  However with the new AEAD
interface this now breaks as the AD SG list contains more bytes
than just the AD.

This patch fixes this by always clamping the AD SG list by the
specified AD length.
