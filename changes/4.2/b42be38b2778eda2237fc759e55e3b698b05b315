netlink: add API to retrieve all group memberships

This patch adds getsockopt(SOL_NETLINK, NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS) to
retrieve all groups a socket is a member of. Currently, we have to use
getsockname() and look at the nl.nl_groups bitmask. However, this mask is
limited to 32 groups. Hence, similar to NETLINK_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and
NETLINK_DROP_MEMBERSHIP, this adds a separate sockopt to manager higher
groups IDs than 32.

This new NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS option takes a pointer to __u32 and the
size of the array. The array is filled with the full membership-set of the
socket, and the required array size is returned in optlen. Hence,
user-space can retry with a properly sized array in case it was too small.
