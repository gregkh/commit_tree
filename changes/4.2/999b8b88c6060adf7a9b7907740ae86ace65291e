9p: ensure err is initialized to 0 in p9_client_read/write

Some use of those functions were providing unitialized values to those
functions. Notably, when reading 0 bytes from an empty file on a 9P
filesystem, the return code of read() was not 0.

Tested with this simple program:

    #include <assert.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(int argc, const char **argv)
    {
        assert(argc == 2);
        char buffer[256];
        int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY);
        assert(fd >= 0);
        assert(read(fd, buffer, 0) == 0);
        return 0;
    }
