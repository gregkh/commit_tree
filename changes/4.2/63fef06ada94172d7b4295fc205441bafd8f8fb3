    drm/i915: Move toggling planes out of crtc enable/disable.

and we still need that crtc->active check since the overall modeset
flow doesn't yet take dpms state into account properly. Fixes WARNING
backtraces on at least bdw/hsw due to the ips disabling code being
upset about being run on a switched-off pipe.

We don't need a corresponding change on the enable side since with the
old setCrtc semantics we always force-enable the pipe after a modeset.
And the dpms function intel_crtc_control already checks for ->active.
