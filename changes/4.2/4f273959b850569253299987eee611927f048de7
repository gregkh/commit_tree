mei: nfc: fix deadlock on shutdown/suspend path

In function mei_nfc_host_exit mei_cl_remove_device cannot be called
under the device mutex as device removing flow invokes the device driver
remove handler that calls in turn to mei_cl_disable_device which
naturally acquires the device mutex.

Also remove mei_cl_bus_remove_devices which has the same issue, but is
never executed as currently the only device on the mei client bus is NFC
and a new device cannot be easily added till the bus revamp is
completed.

This fixes regression caused by commit be9b720a0ccb ("mei_phy: move all
nfc logic from mei driver to nfc")

Prior to this change the nfc driver remove handler called to no-op
disable function while actual nfc device was disabled directly from the
mei driver.
