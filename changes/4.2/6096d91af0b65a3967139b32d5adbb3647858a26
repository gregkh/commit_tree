dm space map metadata: fix occasional leak of a metadata block on resize

The metadata space map has a simplified 'bootstrap' mode that is
operational when extending the space maps.  Whilst in this mode it's
possible for some refcount decrement operations to become queued (eg, as
a result of shadowing one of the bitmap indexes).  These decrements were
not being applied when switching out of bootstrap mode.

The effect of this bug was the leaking of a 4k metadata block.  This is
detected by the latest version of thin_check as a non fatal error.
