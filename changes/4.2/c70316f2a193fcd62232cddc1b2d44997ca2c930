[media] vivid: move PRINTSTR to separate functions

Commit 84cb7be43cec12868e94163c99fdc34c0297c3b8 broke vivid-tpg
(uninitialized variable p).

This patch takes a different approach: four different functions are
created, one for each PRINTSTR version.

In order to avoid the 'the frame size of 1308 bytes is larger than 1024
bytes' warning I had to mark those functions with 'noinline'. For
whatever reason gcc seems to inline this aggressively and it is doing
weird things with the stack.

I tried to read the assembly code, but I couldn't see what exactly it
was doing on the stack.
