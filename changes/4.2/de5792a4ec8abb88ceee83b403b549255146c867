MIPS: Xtalk: Update xwidget.h with known Xtalk device numbers

This is the first patch of two to clean up/update the Xtalk detection
code used by IP27 with some of the code used in the IP30 port.

This specific patch adds Xtalk widget manufacturer and widget device
numbers to arch/mips/include/asm/xtalk/widget.h
