inet: fix races with reqsk timers

reqsk_queue_destroy() and reqsk_queue_unlink() should use
del_timer_sync() instead of del_timer() before calling reqsk_put(),
otherwise we could free a req still used by another cpu.

But before doing so, reqsk_queue_destroy() must release syn_wait_lock
spinlock or risk a dead lock, as reqsk_timer_handler() might
need to take this same spinlock from reqsk_queue_unlink() (called from
inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop())
