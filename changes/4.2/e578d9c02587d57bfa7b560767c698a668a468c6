net: sched: use counter to break reclassify loops

Seems all we want here is to avoid endless 'goto reclassify' loop.
tc_classify_compat even resets this counter when something other
than TC_ACT_RECLASSIFY is returned, so this skb-counter doesn't
break hypothetical loops induced by something other than perpetual
TC_ACT_RECLASSIFY return values.

skb_act_clone is now identical to skb_clone, so just use that.

Tested with following (bogus) filter:
tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: \
 protocol ip u32 match u32 0 0 police rate 10Kbit burst \
 64000 mtu 1500 action reclassify
