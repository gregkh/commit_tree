Drivers: hv: util: introduce state machine for util drivers

KVP/VSS/FCOPY drivers work in fully serialized mode: we wait till userspace
daemon registers, wait for a message from the host, send this message to the
daemon, get the reply, send it back to host, wait for another message.
Introduce enum hvutil_device_state to represend this state in all 3 drivers.
