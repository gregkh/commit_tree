perf report: Fix some option handling on --stdio

There's a bug that perf report sometimes ignore some options on --stdio
output.  This bug is triggered only if a related config variable is set.
For example, let's assume we have a following config file.

  $ cat ~/.perfconfig
  [call-graph]
    print-type = graph
  [hist]
    percentage = absolute

Then, following perf config will not honor some options.

  $ perf record -ag sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.199 MB perf.data (77 samples) ]

  $ perf report -g none --stdio
  # To display the perf.data header info, please use --header/--header-only options.
  #
  # Samples: 77  of event 'cycles'
  # Event count (approx.): 25425383
  #
  # Overhead  Command          Shared Object            Symbol
  # ........  ...............  .......................  ..............
  #
      16.34%  swapper          [kernel.vmlinux]         [k] intel_idle
                      |
                      ---intel_idle
                         cpuidle_enter_state
                         cpuidle_enter
                         cpu_startup_entry
   ...

With '-g none' option, it should not show callchains, but it still shows
callchains.  However it works as expected on --tui output.

Similarly, '--percentage relative' option is not work and still shows a
absolute percentage values.

Looking at the source, I found that those setting were overwritten by
config variables when setup_pager() called.  The setup_pager() is to
start a pager process so that it can manage long lines of output on the
stdio mode.  But as it calls the perf_config() after parsing arguments,
the settings were overwritten regardless of command line options.

The reason it calls perf_config() is to find the 'pager_program' which
might be set by a config variable, I guess.  However current perf code
does not provide the config variable for it, so it's just meaningless
IMHO.  Eliminating the call makes the option working as expected.
