ASoC: brownstone: Automatically disconnect non-connected pins

Most DAPM input and output pins of the wm8994 are either used in the card's
DAPM routing table or are marked as not connected.

The only exception is DMIC2DAT input. Given that DMIC1DAT is explicitly
mentioned in the DAPM routes lets assume that DMIC2DAT simply has been
overlooked and should be marked as not connected.

Set the fully_routed flag of the card instead of manually marking the
unused inputs and outputs as not connected. This makes the code a bit
shorter and cleaner.
