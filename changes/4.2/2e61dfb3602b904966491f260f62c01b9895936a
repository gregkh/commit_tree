clk: of: helper for filling parent clock array and return num of parents

Sprinkled all through the platform clock drivers are code like this to
fill the clock parent array:

for (i = 0; i < num_parents; ++i)
	parent_names[i] = of_clk_get_parent_name(np, i);

The of_clk_parent_fill() will do the same as the code above, and while
at it, return the number of parents as well since the logic of the
function is to the walk the clock node to look for the parent.
