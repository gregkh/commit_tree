iwlwifi: mvm: ROC: Reduce the aux roc max delay

When user space requests mac80211 to transmit a frame off
channel, mac80211 notifies the driver, and the driver requests
a time event from the ucode, and then transmits the frame.
When the driver requests a time event, it can specify what is the allowed
max delay for starting the time event.

When the max delay is too big, this can cause a timeout in the user space,
that is waiting for the frame to be transmitted.

Currently the max delay is extremely long.

Reduce the max delay for the AUX ROC time event that is sent to the ucode.
