rcu: Make RCU able to tolerate undefined CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF

This commit introduces an RCU_FANOUT_LEAF C-preprocessor macro so
that RCU will build even when CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF is undefined.
The RCU_FANOUT_LEAF macro is set to the value of CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF
when defined, otherwise it is set to 32 for 32-bit systems and 64 for
64-bit systems.  This commit then makes CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF depend
on CONFIG_RCU_EXPERT, so that Kconfig users won't be asked about
CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF unless they want to be.
