thermal: power_allocator: allocate with kcalloc what you free with kfree

Commit cf736ea6f902 ("thermal: power_allocator: do not use devm*
interfaces") forgot to change a devm_kcalloc() to just kcalloc(), but
it's corresponding devm_kfree() was changed to kfree().  Allocate with
kcalloc() to match the kfree().
