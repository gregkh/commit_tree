perf tools: Fix the detached tarball wrt rbtree copy

The python binding build process was still looking at the kernel
rbtree.c file, so, when doing a in-tree build it would work, but when
creating a tarball using tools/perf/MANIFEST as the contents list and
then trying to build the resulting detached sources, it failed.

Fix it by removing one level of indirection from rbtree.c in the
tools/perf/util/python-ext-sources file.
