leds: syscon: instantiate from platform device

Currently syscon LEDs will traverse the device tree looking for syscon devices
and if found, traverse any subnodes of these to identify matching children
and from there instantiate LED class devices.

This is not a good use of the Linux device model. Instead we have converted the
device trees to add the "simple-mfd" property to the MFD nexi spawning syscon
LEDs so that these will appear as platform devices in the system and we can
use the proper device probing mechanism.
