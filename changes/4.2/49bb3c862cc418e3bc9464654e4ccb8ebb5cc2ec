drivers: PL011: avoid potential unregister_driver call

Although we care about not unregistering the driver if there are
still ports connected during the .remove callback, we do miss this
check in the pl011_probe function. So if the current port allocation
fails, but there are other ports already registered, we will kill
those.
So factor out the port removal into a separate function and use that
in the probe function, too.
