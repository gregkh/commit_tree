drm/i915: Remove domain flubbing from i915_gem_object_finish_gpu()

We no longer interpolate domains in the same manner, and even if we did,
we should trust setting either of the other write domains would trigger
an invalidation rather than force it. Remove the tweaking of the
read_domains since it serves no purpose and use
i915_gem_object_wait_rendering() directly.

Note that this goes back to
