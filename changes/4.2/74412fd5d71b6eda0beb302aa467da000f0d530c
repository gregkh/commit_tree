crypto: scatterwalk - Check for same address in map_and_copy

This patch adds a check for in scatterwalk_map_and_copy to avoid
copying from the same address to the same address.  This is going
to be used for IV copying in AEAD IV generators.

There is no provision for partial overlaps.

This patch also uses the new scatterwalk_ffwd instead of doing
it by hand in scatterwalk_map_and_copy.
