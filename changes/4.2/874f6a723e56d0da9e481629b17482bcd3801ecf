ACPICA: ACPI 6.0: Add support for IORT table.

ACPICA commit 5de82757aef5d6163e37064033aacbce193abbca

This patch adds support for IORT (IO Remapping Table) in iasl.

Note that some field names are modified to shrink their length or the
decompiled IORT ASL will contain fields with ugly ":" alignment.

The IORT contains field definitions around "Memory Access Properties". This
patch also adds support to encode/decode it using inline table.

This patch doesn't add inline table support for the SMMU interrupt fields
due to a limitation in current ACPICA data table support. Lv Zheng.
