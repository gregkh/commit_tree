md/raid1: extend spinlock to protect raid1_end_read_request against inconsistencies

raid1_end_read_request() assumes that the In_sync bits are consistent
with the ->degaded count.
raid1_spare_active updates the In_sync bit before the ->degraded count
and so exposes an inconsistency, as does error()
So extend the spinlock in raid1_spare_active() and error() to hide those
inconsistencies.

This should probably be part of
  Commit: 34cab6f42003 ("md/raid1: fix test for 'was read error from
  last working device'.")
as it addresses the same issue.  It fixes the same bug and should go
to -stable for same reasons.
