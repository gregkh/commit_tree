Over time, cgroup.h grew organically and doesn't have much logical
structure at this point.  Separation of cgroup-defs.h in the previous
patch gives us a good chance for reorganizing cgroup.h as changes to
the header are likely to cause conflicts anyway.

This patch reorganizes cgroup.h so that it has consistent logical
grouping.

This is pure reorganization.

v2: Relocating #ifdef CONFIG_CGROUPS caused build failure when cgroup
    is disabled.  Dropped.
