ASoC: wm_adsp: Use __leXX for little endian data

Using uXX for little endian data, was triggering some warnings through
sparse:

sound/soc/codecs/wm_adsp.c:716:26: sparse: cast to restricted __le16
sound/soc/codecs/wm_adsp.c:736:23: sparse: cast to restricted __le16
sound/soc/codecs/wm_adsp.c:739:23: sparse: cast to restricted __le32

Correct this by changing the casts to use __leXX instead of uXX.
