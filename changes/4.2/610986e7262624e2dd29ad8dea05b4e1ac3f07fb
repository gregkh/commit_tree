etherdev: Use skb->data to retrieve Ethernet header instead of eth_hdr

Avoid recomputing the Ethernet header location and instead just use the
pointer provided by skb->data.  The problem with using eth_hdr is that the
compiler wasn't smart enough to realize that skb->head + skb->mac_header
was the same thing as skb->data before it added ETH_HLEN.  By just caching
it off before calling skb_pull_inline we can avoid a few unnecessary
instructions.
