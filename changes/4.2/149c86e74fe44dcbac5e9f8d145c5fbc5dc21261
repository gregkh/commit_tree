drm/i915: Allocate context objects from stolen

As we never expose context objects directly to userspace, we can forgo
allocating a first-class GEM object for them and prefer to use the
limited resource of reserved/stolen memory for them. Note this means
that their initial contents are undefined.

However, a downside of using stolen objects for execlists is that we
cannot access the physical address directly (thanks MCH!) which prevents
their use.
