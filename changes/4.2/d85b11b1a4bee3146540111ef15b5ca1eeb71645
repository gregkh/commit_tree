toshiba_bluetooth: Adapt *_enable, *_notify and *_resume functions to rfkill

This patch adapts toshiba_bluetooth_enable, toshiba_bt_rfkill_notify
and toshiba_bt_resume functions to rfkill.

The *_enable function was cleaned from code that the rfkill code now
provides, and the other two functions were modified to update the rfkill
switch status, as they were only calling toshiba_bluetooth_enable.
