ASoC: Add helper functions bias level management

Currently drivers are responsible for managing the bias_level field of
their DAPM context. The DAPM state itself is managed by the DAPM core
though and the core has certain expectations on how and when the bias_level
field should be updated. If drivers don't adhere to these undefined
behavior can occur.

This patch adds a few helper functions for manipulating the DAPM context
state, each function with a description on when it should be used and what
its effects are. This will also help us to move more of the bias_level
management from drivers to the DAPM core.

For convenience also add snd_soc_codec_* wrappers around these helpers.
