xprtrdma: Remove ->ro_reset

An RPC can exit at any time. When it does so, xprt_rdma_free() is
called, and it calls ->op_unmap().

If ->ro_reset() is running due to a transport disconnect, the two
methods can race while processing the same rpcrdma_mw. The results
are unpredictable.

Because of this, in previous patches I've altered ->ro_map() to
handle MR reset. ->ro_reset() is no longer needed and can be
removed.
