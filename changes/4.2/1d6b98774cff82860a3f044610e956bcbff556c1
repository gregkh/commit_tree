tty: constify return type of tty_name

All users of tty_name pass the result directly to a printf-like
function. This means we can actually let tty_name return the literal
"NULL tty" or tty->name directly, avoiding the strcpy and a lot of
medium-sized stack buffers. In preparation for that, make the return
type const char*.

While at it, we can also constify the tty parameter.
