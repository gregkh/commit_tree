bus: arm-ccn: Use hrtimer_start() again

hrtimer_start() will no longer defer already expired timers to the
softirq in 4.2, and the __hrtimer_start_range_ns() function is
getting removed, causing build errors when both the tip tree and
the arm-ccn changes are merged.

This changes the code back to using hrtimer_start, which will
do the right thing after this branch gets merged with the
timers update from tip.

As pointed out after a discussion on the mailing list, the result will
not be worse than the what was there before you pulled my updates, as
the code was using normal hrtimer_start(). It's just when I realised
that it should be pinned I looked at what x86 uncore pmu is doing and
shamelessly (and probably a bit mindlessly) copied the "do not wakeup"
version from there.
