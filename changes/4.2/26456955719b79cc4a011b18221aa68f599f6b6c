jfs: clean up jfs_rename and fix out of order unlock

The end of jfs_rename(), which is also used by the error paths,
included a call to IWRITE_UNLOCK(new_ip) after labels out1, out2
and out3. If we come in through these labels, IWRITE_LOCK() has not
been called yet.

In moving that call to the correct spot, I also moved some
exceptional truncate code earlier as well, since the early error
paths don't need to deal with it, and I renamed out4: to out_tx: so
a future patch by Jan Kara doesn't need to deal with renumbering or
confusing out-of-order labels.
