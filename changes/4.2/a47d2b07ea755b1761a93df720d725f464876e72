KVM: introduce kvm_alloc/free_memslots

kvm_alloc_memslots is extracted out of previously scattered code
that was in kvm_init_memslots_id and kvm_create_vm.

kvm_free_memslot and kvm_free_memslots are new names of
kvm_free_physmem and kvm_free_physmem_slot, but they also take
an explicit pointer to struct kvm_memslots.

This will simplify the transition to multiple address spaces,
each represented by one pointer to struct kvm_memslots.
