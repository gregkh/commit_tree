net: Get skb hash over flow_keys structure

This patch changes flow hashing to use jhash2 over the flow_keys
structure instead just doing jhash_3words over src, dst, and ports.
This method will allow us take more input into the hashing function
so that we can include full IPv6 addresses, VLAN, flow labels etc.
without needing to resort to xor'ing which makes for a poor hash.
