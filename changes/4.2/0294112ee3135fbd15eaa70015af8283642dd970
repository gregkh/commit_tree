ACPI / PNP: Reserve ACPI resources at the fs_initcall_sync stage

This effectively reverts the following three commits:

 7bc10388ccdd ACPI / resources: free memory on error in add_region_before()
 0f1b414d1907 ACPI / PNP: Avoid conflicting resource reservations
 b9a5e5e18fbf ACPI / init: Fix the ordering of acpi_reserve_resources()

(commit b9a5e5e18fbf introduced regressions some of which, but not
all, were addressed by commit 0f1b414d1907 and commit 7bc10388ccdd
was a fixup on top of the latter) and causes ACPI fixed hardware
resources to be reserved at the fs_initcall_sync stage of system
initialization.

The story is as follows.  First, a boot regression was reported due
to an apparent resource reservation ordering change after a commit
that shouldn't lead to such changes.  Investigation led to the
conclusion that the problem happened because acpi_reserve_resources()
was executed at the device_initcall() stage of system initialization
which wasn't strictly ordered with respect to driver initialization
(and with respect to the initialization of the pcieport driver in
particular), so a random change causing the device initcalls to be
run in a different order might break things.

The response to that was to attempt to run acpi_reserve_resources()
as soon as we knew that ACPI would be in use (commit b9a5e5e18fbf).
However, that turned out to be too early, because it caused resource
reservations made by the PNP system driver to fail on at least one
system and that failure was addressed by commit 0f1b414d1907.

That fix still turned out to be insufficient, though, because
calling acpi_reserve_resources() before the fs_initcall stage of
system initialization caused a boot regression to happen on the
eCAFE EC-800-H20G/S netbook.  That meant that we only could call
acpi_reserve_resources() at the fs_initcall initialization stage
or later, but then we might just as well call it after the PNP
initalization in which case commit 0f1b414d1907 wouldn't be
necessary any more.

For this reason, the changes made by commit 0f1b414d1907 are reverted
(along with a memory leak fixup on top of that commit), the changes
made by commit b9a5e5e18fbf that went too far are reverted too and
acpi_reserve_resources() is changed into fs_initcall_sync, which
will cause it to be executed after the PNP subsystem initialization
(which is an fs_initcall) and before device initcalls (including
the pcieport driver initialization) which should avoid the initial
issue.
