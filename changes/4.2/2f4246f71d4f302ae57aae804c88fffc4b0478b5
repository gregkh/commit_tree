staging:lustre: cleanup libcfs lock handling

Previously with libcfs being built for user land and kernel
space wrappers were created to transparently handle locking.
Now that user land support has been removed we delete all
those locking wrappers with this patch. Many of those changes
landed upstream but some nice cleanups still remain that are
pushed in this patch.
