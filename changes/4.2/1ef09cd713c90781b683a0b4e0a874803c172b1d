tick-broadcast: Fix the printing of broadcast masks

Today the number of bits of the broadcast masks that is output into
/proc/timer_list is sizeof(unsigned long). This means that on machines
with a larger number of CPUs, the bitmasks of CPUs beyond this range do
not appear.

Fix this by using bitmap printing through "%*pb" instead, so as to
output the broadcast masks for the range of nr_cpu_ids into
/proc/timer_list.
