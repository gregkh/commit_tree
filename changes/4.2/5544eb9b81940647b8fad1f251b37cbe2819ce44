KVM: count number of assigned devices

If there are no assigned devices, the guest PAT are not providing
any useful information and can be overridden to writeback; VMX
always does this because it has the "IPAT" bit in its extended
page table entries, but SVM does not have anything similar.
Hook into VFIO and legacy device assignment so that they
provide this information to KVM.
