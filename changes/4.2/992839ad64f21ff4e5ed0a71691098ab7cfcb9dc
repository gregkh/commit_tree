drm/amdkfd: Add static user-mode queues support

This patch adds support for static user-mode queues in QCM.
Queues which are designated as static can NOT be preempted by
the CP microcode when it is executing its scheduling algorithm.

This is needed for supporting the debugger feature, because we
can't allow the CP to preempt queues which are currently being debugged.

The number of queues that can be designated as static is limited by the
number of HQDs (Hardware Queue Descriptors).
