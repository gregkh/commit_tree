netfilter: bridge: don't leak skb in error paths

br_nf_dev_queue_xmit must free skb in its error path.
NF_DROP is misleading -- its an okfn, not a netfilter hook.

Fixes: 462fb2af9788a ("bridge : Sanitize skb before it enters the IP stack")
Fixes: efb6de9b4ba00 ("netfilter: bridge: forward IPv6 fragmented packets")
