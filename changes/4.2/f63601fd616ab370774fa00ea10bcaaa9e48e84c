crypto: marvell/cesa - add a new driver for Marvell's CESA

The existing mv_cesa driver supports some features of the CESA IP but is
quite limited, and reworking it to support new features (like involving the
TDMA engine to offload the CPU) is almost impossible.
This driver has been rewritten from scratch to take those new features into
account.

This commit introduce the base infrastructure allowing us to add support
for DMA optimization.
It also includes support for one hash (SHA1) and one cipher (AES)
algorithm, and enable those features on the Armada 370 SoC.

Other algorithms and platforms will be added later on.
