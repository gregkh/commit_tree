igb: Don't use NETDEV_FRAG_PAGE_MAX_SIZE in descriptor calculation

This change updates igb so that it will correctly perform the descriptor
count calculation.  Previously it was taking NETDEV_FRAG_PAGE_MAX_SIZE
into account with isn't really correct since a different value is used to
determine the size of the pages used for TCP.  That is actually determined
by SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER.
