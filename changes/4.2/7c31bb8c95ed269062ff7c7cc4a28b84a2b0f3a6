perf probe: Fix failure to probe events on arm

Fix failure to probe events on arm, the problem was introduced by commit
5a51fcd1f30c ("perf probe: Skip kernel symbols which is out of .text").

For some architectures, the '_etext' label is not in the .text section
(in the .notes section for arm/arm64).  Labels out of the .text section
are not loaded as symbols and we get a zero value when looking up its
addresses, which causes all events to be wrongly skipped.

This patch skips checking the text address range when failing to get the
address of '_etext' and thus fixes the problem.

The problem can be reproduced on arm as follows:

  # perf probe --add='generic_perform_write'
  generic_perform_write+0 is out of .text, skip it.
  Probe point 'generic_perform_write' not found.
    Error: Failed to add events.

After this patch:

  # perf probe --add='generic_perform_write'
  Added new event:
    probe:generic_perform_write (on generic_perform_write)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

    perf record -e probe:generic_perform_write -aR sleep 1
