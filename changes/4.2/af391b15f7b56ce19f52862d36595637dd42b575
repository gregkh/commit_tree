arm64: kernel: rename __cpu_suspend to keep it aligned with arm

This patch renames __cpu_suspend to cpu_suspend so that it's aligned
with ARM32. It also removes the redundant wrapper created.

This is in preparation to implement generic PSCI system suspend using
the cpu_{suspend,resume} which now has the same interface on both ARM
and ARM64.
