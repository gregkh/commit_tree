perf/x86/intel: Simplify the dynamic constraint code somewhat

We have two 'struct event_constraint' local variables in
intel_get_excl_constraints(): 'cx' and 'c'.

Instead of using 'cx' after the dynamic allocation, put all 'cx' inside
the dynamic allocation block and use 'c' outside of it.

Also use direct assignment to copy the structure; let the compiler
figure it out.
