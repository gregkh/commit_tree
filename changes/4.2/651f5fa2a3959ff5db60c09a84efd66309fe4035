dm cache: defer whole cells

Currently individual bios are deferred to the worker thread if they
cannot be processed immediately (eg, a block is in the process of
being moved to the fast device).

This patch passes whole cells across to the worker.  This saves
reaquiring the cell, and also collects bios destined for the same block
together, which allows them to be mapped with a single look up to the
policy.  This reduces the overhead of using dm-cache.
