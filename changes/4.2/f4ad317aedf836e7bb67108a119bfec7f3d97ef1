dm log writes: use ULL suffix for 64-bit constants

On 32-bit:
drivers/md/dm-log-writes.c: In function ‘log_super’:
drivers/md/dm-log-writes.c:323: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type

Add a ULL suffix to WRITE_LOG_MAGIC to fix this.
Also add a ULL suffix to WRITE_LOG_VERSION as it's stored in a __le64
field.
