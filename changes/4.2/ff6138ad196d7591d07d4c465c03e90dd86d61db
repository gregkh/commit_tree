arm/mach-mvebu: remove legacy __cpuinit sections that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time
ago.  However these ones crept back in as of commit 1ee89e2231a1b04dc3476
("ARM: mvebu: add SMP support for Armada 375 and Armada 38x")

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
Note that there would normally be a corresponding removal of
a ".previous" directive for each __CPUINIT in asm files, but in
this case it appears that this single function file was never
paired off with one.
