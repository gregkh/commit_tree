arm64: Do not attempt to use init_mm in reset_context()

After secondary CPU boot or hotplug, the active_mm of the idle thread is
&init_mm. The init_mm.pgd (swapper_pg_dir) is only meant for TTBR1_EL1
and must not be set in TTBR0_EL1. Since when active_mm == &init_mm the
TTBR0_EL1 is already set to the reserved value, there is no need to
perform any context reset.
