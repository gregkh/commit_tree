ASoC: qcom: remove incorrect dependencies

Compile-tests show a warning for the newly added SND_SOC_STORM
symbol:

warning: (SND_SOC_STORM) selects SND_SOC_LPASS_CPU which has unmet direct dependencies (SOUND && !M68K && !UML && SND && SND_SOC && SND_SOC_QCOM)

The problem is that it can be selected for COMPILE_TEST on non-QCOM
builds, but the symbols it selects have a dependency.
Dropping the dependencies makes it work without warnings and no
other side-effects, because these are not user-visible.
