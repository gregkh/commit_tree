MIPS: dump_tlb: Refactor TLB matching

Refactor the TLB matching code in dump_tlb() slightly so that the
conditions which can cause a TLB entry to be skipped can be more easily
extended. This should prevent the match condition getting unwieldy once
it is updated to take further conditions into account.
