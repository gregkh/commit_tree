net: thunderx: Cleanup duplicate NODE_ID macros, add nic_get_node_id()

There are duplicate NODE_ID macro definitions. Move all of them to
nic.h for usage in nic and bgx driver and introduce nic_get_node_id()
helper function.

This patch also fixes 64bit mask which should have been ULL by
reworking the node calculation.
