x86/fpu: Fix double-increment in setup_xstate_features()

I noticed that my MPX tracepoints were producing garbage for the
lower and upper bounds:

	mpx_bounds_register_exception: address referenced: 0x00007fffffffccb7 bounds: lower: 0x0 ~upper: 0xffffffffffffffff
	mpx_bounds_register_exception: address referenced: 0x00007fffffffccbf bounds: lower: 0x0 ~upper: 0xffffffffffffffff

This is, of course, bogus because 0x00007fffffffccbf is *within*
the bounds.  I assumed that my instruction decoder was bad and
went looking at it.  But I eventually realized that I was
getting a '0' offset back from xstate_offsets[BNDREGS].

It was being skipped in the initialization, which is obviously
bogus, so remove the extra leaf++.

This also goes an initializes xstate_offsets/sizes[] to -1 so
so that bugs like this will oops instead of silently failing
in interesting ways.

This was introduced by:
