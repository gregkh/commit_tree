powerpc/powernv: Reorder OPAL subsystem initialisation

Most of the OPAL subsystems are always compiled in for PowerNV and
many of them need to be initialised before or after other OPAL
subsystems. Rather than trying to control this ordering through
machine initcalls it is clearer and easier to control initialisation
order with explicit calls in opal_init.
