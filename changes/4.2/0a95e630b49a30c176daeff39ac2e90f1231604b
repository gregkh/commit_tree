cpufreq: arm_big_little: check if the frequency is set correctly

The actual frequency is set through "clk_change_rate" which is void
function. If the underlying hardware fails and returns error, the error
is lost in the clk layer. In order to track such failures, we need to
read back the frequency(just the cached value as clk_recalc called after
clk->ops->set_rate gets the frequency)

This patch adds check to see if the frequency is set correctly or if
they were any hardware failures and sends the appropriate errors to the
cpufreq core.
