ARM: dts: sun7i: Add uart4 support for BananaPro, disable uart2

The BananaPro uses uart4 for the default rx/tx pins on the 40 pins connector,
so enable uart4.

Uart2 is also available at the bananapro io-pins, but like on the bananapi
the primary function of the pins is to act as gpios, see:

Remove the uart2 node, people who want to use uart2 can do so with a
devicetree-overlay.
