i40e: Collect PFC XOFF RX stats even in single TC case

When PFC is enabled for any UP in single TC configuration the driver didn't
collect the PFC XOFF RX stats. Though a single TC with PFC enabled is not a
common scenario do not prevent the driver from collecting stats if firmware
indicates that PFC is enabled.
