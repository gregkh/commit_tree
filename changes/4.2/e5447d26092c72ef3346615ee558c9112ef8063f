pinctrl: mvebu: armada-375: remove non-existing NAND re/we pins

After updating to a more recent version of the Armada 375, we realized
that some of the pins documented as having a NAND-related
functionality in fact did not have such functionality. This commit
updates the pinctrl driver accordingly.
