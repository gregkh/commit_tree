leds: fix brightness changing when software blinking is active

The following sequence:
echo timer >/sys/class/leds/<name>/trigger
echo 1 >/sys/class/leds/<name>/brightness
should change the ON brightness for blinking.
The function led_set_brightness() was mistakenly initiating the
delayed blink stop procedure, which resulted in no blinking with
the timer trigger still active.

This patch fixes the problem by changing led_set_brightness()
to not initiate the delayed blink stop when brightness is not 0.
