driver: xen-blkfront: move talk_to_blkback to a more suitable place

The major responsibility of talk_to_blkback() is allocate and initialize
the request ring and write the ring info to xenstore.
But this work should be done after backend entered 'XenbusStateInitWait' as
defined in the protocol file.
See xen/include/public/io/blkif.h in XEN git tree:

                                     XenbusStateInitWait

o Query backend features and
  transport parameters.
o Allocate and initialize the
  request ring.

There is no problem with this yet, but it is an violation of the design and
furthermore it would not allow frontend/backend to negotiate 'multi-page'
and 'multi-queue' features.

Changes in v2:
 - Re-write the commit message to be more clear.
