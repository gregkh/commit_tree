tracing: add trace event for memory-failure

RAS user space tools like rasdaemon which base on trace event, could
receive mce error event, but no memory recovery result event.  So, I want
to add this event to make this scenario complete.

This patch add a event at ras group for memory-failure.

The output like below:
#  tracer: nop
#
#  entries-in-buffer/entries-written: 2/2   #P:24
#
#                               _-----=> irqs-off
#                              / _----=> need-resched
#                             | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
#                             || / _--=> preempt-depth
#                             ||| /     delay
#            TASK-PID   CPU#  ||||    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
#               | |       |   ||||       |         |
