staging: unisys: Don't hold device responses until driver loads

Currently if a driver is not loaded for a device, we will not
respond to the device create until it is done. This causes
s-Par to not mark the partition running if the driver for the
device is not loaded. Since there are several devices that
could be assigned to a guest that don't have an actual
driver this will cause us to never go running.

If the device driver is loaded, we WILL continue to only
respond to the device PAUSE message when the device driver
has responded that it is done with the device.
