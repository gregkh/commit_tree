fs: Add helper functions for permanently empty directories.

To ensure it is safe to mount proc and sysfs I need to check if
filesystems that are mounted on top of them are mounted on truly empty
directories.  Given that some directories can gain entries over time,
knowing that a directory is empty right now is insufficient.

Therefore add supporting infrastructure for permantently empty
directories that proc and sysfs can use when they create mount points
for filesystems and fs_fully_visible can use to test for permanently
empty directories to ensure that nothing will be gained by mounting a
fresh copy of proc or sysfs.
