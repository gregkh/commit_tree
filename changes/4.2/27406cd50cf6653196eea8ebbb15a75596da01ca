KVM: s390: provide functions for blocking all CPUs

Some updates to the control blocks need to be done in a way that
ensures that no CPU is within SIE. Provide wrappers around the
s390_vcpu_block functions and adopt the TOD migration code to
update in a guaranteed fashion. Also rename these functions to
have the kvm_s390_ prefix as everything else.
