ARCv2: MMUv4: cache programming model changes

Caveats about cache flush on ARCv2 based cores

- dcache is PIPT so paddr is sufficient for cache maintenance ops (no
  need to setup PTAG reg

- icache is still VIPT but only aliasing configs need PTAG setup

So basically this is departure from MMU-v3 which always need vaddr in
line ops registers (DC_IVDL, DC_FLDL, IC_IVIL) but paddr in DC_PTAG,
IC_PTAG respectively.
