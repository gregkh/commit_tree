target: fix DPO and FUA bit checks

Drivers may override the WCE flag, in which case the DPOFUA flag in
MODE SENSE might differ from the check used to reject invalid FUA
bits in sbc_check_dpofua.  Also now that we reject invalid FUA
bits early there is no need to duplicate the same buggy check
down in the fileio code.

As the DPOFUA flag controls th support for FUA bits on read and
write commands as well as DPO key off all the checks off a single
helper, and deprecate the emulate_dpo and emulate_fua_read attributs.

This fixes various failures in the libiscsi testsuite.

Personally I'd prefer to also remove the emulate_fua_write attribute
as there is no good reason to disable it, but I'll leave that for
a separate discussion.
