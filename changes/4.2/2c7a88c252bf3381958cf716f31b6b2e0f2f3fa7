etherdev: Fix sparse error, make test usable by other functions

This change does two things.  First it fixes a sparse error for the fact
that the __be16 degrades to an integer.  Since that is actually what I am
kind of doing I am simply working around that by forcing both sides of the
comparison to u16.

Also I realized on some compilers I was generating another instruction for
big endian systems such as PowerPC since it was masking the value before
doing the comparison.  So to resolve that I have simply pulled the mask out
and wrapped it in an #ifndef __BIG_ENDIAN.

Lastly I pulled this all out into its own function.  I notices there are
similar checks in a number of other places so this function can be reused
there to help reduce overhead in these paths as well.
