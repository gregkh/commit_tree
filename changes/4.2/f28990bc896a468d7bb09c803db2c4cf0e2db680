IB/mad: Add partial Intel OPA MAD support

Add OPA SMP processing functionality.

Define the new OPA SMP format, create support functions for this format using
the previously defined helper functions as appropriate.

These functions are defined in this patch and used in the final OPA MAD support
patch.
