ASoC: topology: Update TLV support so we can support more TLV types

Currently the TLV topology structure is targeted at only supporting the
DB scale data. This patch extends support for the other TLV types so they
can be easily added at a later stage.

TLV structure is moved to common topology control header since it's a
common field for controls and can be processed in a general way.

Users must set a proper access flag for a control since it's used to
decide if the TLV field is valid and if a TLV callback is needed.

Removed the following fields from topology TLV struct:
- size/count: type can decide the size.
- numid: not needed to initialize TLV for kcontrol.
- data: replaced by the type specific struct.

Added TLV structure to generic control header and removed TLV structure
from mixer control.
