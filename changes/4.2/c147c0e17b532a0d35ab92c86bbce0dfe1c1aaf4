ASoC: topology: Add topology UAPI header

 The ASoC topology UAPI header defines the structures
 required to define any DSP firmware audio topology and control objects from
 userspace.

The following objects are supported :-
 o kcontrols including TLV controls.
 o DAPM widgets and graph elements
 o Vendor bespoke objects.
 o Coefficient data
 o FE PCM capabilities and config.
 o BE link capabilities and config.
 o Codec <-> codec link capabilities and config.
 o Topology object manifest.

The file format is simple and divided into blocks for each object type and
each block has a header that defines it's size and type. Blocks can be in
any order of type and can either all be in a single file or spread across
more than one file. Blocks also have a group identifier ID so that they can
be loaded and unloaded by ID.
