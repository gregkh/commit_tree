drm/i915: Remove vestigal DRI1 ring quiescing code

After the removal of DRI1, all access to the rings are through requests
and so we can always be sure that there is a request to wait upon to
free up available space. The fallback code only existed so that we could
quiesce the GPU following unmediated access by DRI1.
