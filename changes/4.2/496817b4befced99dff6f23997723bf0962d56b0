xfs: clean up XFS_MIN_FREELIST macros

We no longer calculate the minimum freelist size from the on-disk
AGF, so we don't need the macros used for this. That means the
nested macros can be cleaned up, and turn this into an actual
function so the logic is clear and concise. This will make it much
easier to add support for the rmap btree when the time comes.

This also gets rid of the XFS_AG_MAXLEVELS macro used by these
freelist macros as it is simply a wrapper around a single variable.
