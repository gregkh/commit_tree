staging: lustre: obdclass: obd_config: remove unneeded null test before free

Kfree can cope with a null argument, so drop null tests.

The semantic patch that identifies this issue is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@ expression ptr; @@

- if (ptr != NULL)
  kfree(ptr);
// </smpl>

The first part of the patch introduces new labels to avoid unnecessary
calls to kfree.  In addition, lprof->lp_md is always null in the cleanup
code at the end of the function, so that kfree is just dropped.
