crypto: nx - add NX-842 platform frontend driver

Add NX-842 frontend that allows using either the pSeries platform or
PowerNV platform driver (to be added by later patch) for the NX-842
hardware.  Update the MAINTAINERS file to include the new filenames.
Update Kconfig files to clarify titles and descriptions, and correct
dependencies.
