KVM: x86: add module parameter to disable periodic kvmclock sync

The periodic kvmclock sync can be an undesired source of latencies.

When running cyclictest on a guest, a latency spike is visible.
With kvmclock periodic sync disabled, the spike is gone.

Guests should use ntp which means the propagations of ntp corrections
from the host clock are unnecessary.

v2:
-> Make parameter read-only (Radim)
-> Return early on kvmclock_sync_fn (Andrew)
