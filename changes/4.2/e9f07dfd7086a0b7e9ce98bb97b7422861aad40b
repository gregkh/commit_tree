writeback: add dirty_throttle_control->dom

Currently all dirty throttle operations use global_wb_domain; however,
cgroup writeback support requires considering per-memcg wb_domain too.
This patch adds dirty_throttle_control->dom and updates functions
which are directly using globabl_wb_domain to use it instead.

As this makes global_update_bandwidth() a misnomer, the function is
renamed to domain_update_bandwidth().

This patch doesn't introduce any behavioral changes.
