vme: tsi148: fix first DMA item mapping

This moves DMA mapping of the first list element to vme_list_add, the
same place where other elements mappings occur. This prevents extra
mapping or over-unmapping in the cases when vme_list_exec is called more
or less than one time respectively.

Also adds dma_mapping_error check.
