ceph: use empty snap context for uninline_data and get_pool_perm

Cached_context in ceph_snap_realm is directly accessed by
uninline_data() and get_pool_perm(). This is racy in theory.
both uninline_data() and get_pool_perm() do not modify existing
object, they only create new object. So we can pass the empty
snap context to them.  Unlike cached_context in ceph_snap_realm,
we do not need to protect the empty snap context.
