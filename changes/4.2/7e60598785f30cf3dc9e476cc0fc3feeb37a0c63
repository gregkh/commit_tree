sched/wait: Change wait_on_bit*() to take an unsigned long *, not a void *

The implementations of wait_on_bit*() will only work with long-aligned
memory on systems that don't support misaligned loads and stores.

This patch changes the function prototypes to ensure that the compiler
will enforce alignment.

Running

  make defconfig
  make KFLAGS="-Werror"

seems to indicate that, as of c56fb6564dcd ("Fix a misaligned load
inside ptrace_attach()"), there are now no users of non-long-aligned
calls to wait_on_bit*().  I additionally tried a few "make randconfig"
attempts, none of which failed to compile for this reason.
