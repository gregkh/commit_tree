cpufreq: qoriq: optimize the CPU frequency switching time

Each time the CPU switches its frequency, the clock nodes in
DTS are walked through to find proper clock source. This is
very time-consuming, for example, it is up to 500+ us on T4240.
Besides, switching time varies from clock to clock.
To optimize this, each input clock of CPU is buffered, so that
it can be picked up instantly when needed.

Since for each CPU each input clock is stored in a pointer
which takes 4 or 8 bytes memory and normally there are several
input clocks per CPU, that will not take much memory as well.
