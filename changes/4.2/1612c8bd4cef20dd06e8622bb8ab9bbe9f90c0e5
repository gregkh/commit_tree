drm/i915: Fix the IBX transcoder B workarounds

Currently the IBX transcoder B workarounds are not working correctly.
Well, the HDMI one seems to be working somewhat, but the DP one is
definitely busted.

After a bit of experimentation it looks like the best way to make this
work is first disable the port on transcoder B, and then re-enable it
transcoder A, and immediately disable it again.

We can also clean up the code by noting that we can't be called without
a valid crtc. And also note that port A on ILK does not need the
workaround, so let's check for that one too.
