irq: Add irq_set_chained_handler_and_data()

Driver authors seem to get the ordering of irq_set_chained_handler()
and irq_set_handler_data() wrong - ordering the former before the
latter.  This opens a race window where, if there is an interrupt
pending, the handler will be called between these two calls,
potentially resulting in an oops.

Provide a single interface to set both of these together, especially
as that's commonly what is required.
