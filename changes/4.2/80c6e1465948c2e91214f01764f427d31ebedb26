driver-core: fix build for !CONFIG_MODULES

Commit f2411da74698 ("driver-core: add driver module asynchronous probe
support") broke build in case modules are disabled, because in this case
"struct module" is not defined and we can't dereference it. Let's define
module_requested_async_probing() helper and stub it out if modules are
disabled.
