usb: dwc2: embed storage for reg backup in struct dwc2_hsotg

Register backup function can be called from atomic context. Instead
of using atomic memory pool, embed backup storage space in
struct dwc2_hsotg.

Also add a valid flag in each struct as NULL pointer can't be used as
the content validity check any more.
