iwlwifi: mvm: add inactive state to ebs status

Currently EBS status in scan complete notifications is set to
success if EBS wasn't activated. FW will add a special return
value for cases when EBS wasn't activated and we add a print
of this status.

This change is needed for debug only, no behavior changes.
