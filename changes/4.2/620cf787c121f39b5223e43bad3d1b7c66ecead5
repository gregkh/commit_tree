coresight: replicator: Add Qualcomm CoreSight Replicator driver

This driver manages Qualcomm CoreSight Replicator device, which
resides on the AMBA bus. Replicator has been made programmable to
allow software to turn of the replicator branch to sink that is not
being used. This avoids trace traffic to the unused/non-current sink
from causing back pressure that results in overflows at the source.
