x86/cpu: Trim model ID whitespace

We did try trimming whitespace surrounding the 'model name'
field in /proc/cpuinfo since reportedly some userspace uses it
in string comparisons and there were discrepancies:

  [thetango@prarit ~]# grep "^model name" /proc/cpuinfo | uniq -c | sed 's/\ /_/g'
  ______1_model_name      :_AMD_Opteron(TM)_Processor_6272
  _____63_model_name      :_AMD_Opteron(TM)_Processor_6272_________________

However, there were issues with overlapping buffers, string
sizes and non-byte-sized copies in the previous proposed
solutions; see Link tags below for the whole farce.

So, instead of diddling with this more, let's simply extend what
was there originally with trimming any present trailing
whitespace. Final result is really simple and obvious.

Testing with the most insane model IDs qemu can generate, looks
good:

  .model_id = "            My funny model ID CPU          ",
  ______4_model_name      :_My_funny_model_ID_CPU

  .model_id = "My funny model ID CPU          ",
  ______4_model_name      :_My_funny_model_ID_CPU

  .model_id = "            My funny model ID CPU",
  ______4_model_name      :_My_funny_model_ID_CPU

  .model_id = "            ",
  ______4_model_name      :__

  .model_id = "",
  ______4_model_name      :_15/02
