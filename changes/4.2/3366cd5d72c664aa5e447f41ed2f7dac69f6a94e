[media] ts2020: Provide DVBv5 API signal strength

Provide a DVBv5 API signal strength.  This is in units of 0.001 dBm rather
than a percentage.

>From Antti Palosaari's testing with a signal generator, it appears that the
gain calculated according to Montage's specification if negated is a
reasonable representation of the signal strength of the generator.

To this end:

 (1) Polled statistic gathering needed to be implemented in the TS2020 driver.
     This is done in the ts2020_stat_work() function.

 (2) The calculated gain is placed as the signal strength in the
     dtv_property_cache associated with the front end with the scale set to
     FE_SCALE_DECIBEL.

 (3) The DVBv3 format signal strength then needed to be calculated from the
     signal strength stored in the dtv_property_cache rather than accessing
     the value when ts2020_read_signal_strength() is called.
