HID: sony: Add support for the Sony Motion Controller

Add a fixed-up HID descriptor for the Sony motion controller and enable
controls for the LED light as well as force-feedback.

The LED is multi-colored (red, green, blue).

The motion controller has a single rumble motor so the higher of the left
and right values is used to set the speed.
