HID: rmi: Disable populating F30 when the touchpad has physical buttons

Physical buttons do not use F30 to report their state and in some cases the
data reported in F30 is incorrect and inconsistent with what is reported by
the HID descriptor. When physical buttons are present, ignore F30 and let
hid-input report buttons based on what is defined in the HID descriptor.
