s390: adapt entry.S to the move of thread_struct

git commit 0c8c0f03e3a292e031596484275c14cf39c0ab7a
"x86/fpu, sched: Dynamically allocate 'struct fpu'"
moved the thread_struct to the end of the task_struct.

This causes some of the offsets used in entry.S to overflow their
instruction operand field. To fix this  use aghi to create a
dedicated pointer for the thread_struct.
