perf tests: Add testing for Makefile.perf

Currently we test only builds through top level Makefile, but seems like
there's a bunch of users using Makefile.perf directly.

Changing the make suite to be run for Makefile.perf as well.  It takes
now considerable amount of time, but hopefully we catch more issues.

Also fixing the output indentation for make_kernelsrc and
make_kernelsrc_tools tests.
