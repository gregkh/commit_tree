MIPS: c-r4k: Remove legacy __cpuinit section that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time ago.
However a new instance was added in commit 4caa906ee949b7002cc1558bbe3744
("MIPS: mm: c-r4k: Build EVA {d,i}cache flushing functions")

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
