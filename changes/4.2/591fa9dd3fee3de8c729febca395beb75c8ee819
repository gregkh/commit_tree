usb: musb: Add pre and post root port reset end callbacks

The sunxi otg phy has a bug where it wrongly detects a high speed squelch
when reset on the root port gets de-asserted with a lo-speed device.

The workaround for this is to disable squelch detect before de-asserting
reset, and re-enabling it after the reset de-assert is done.
