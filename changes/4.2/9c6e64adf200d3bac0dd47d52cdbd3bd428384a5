Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use the vp_index map even for channels bound to CPU 0

Map target_cpu to target_vcpu using the mapping table.
We should use the mapping table to transform guest CPU ID to VP Index
as is done for the non-performance critical channels.
While the value CPU 0 is special and will
map to VP index 0, it is good to be consistent.
