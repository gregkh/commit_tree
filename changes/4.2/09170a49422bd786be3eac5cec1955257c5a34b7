KVM: const-ify uses of struct kvm_userspace_memory_region

Architecture-specific helpers are not supposed to muck with
struct kvm_userspace_memory_region contents.  Add const to
enforce this.

In order to eliminate the only write in __kvm_set_memory_region,
the cleaning of deleted slots is pulled up from update_memslots
to __kvm_set_memory_region.
