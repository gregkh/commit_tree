writeback: make laptop_mode_timer_fn() handle multiple bdi_writeback's

For cgroup writeback support, all bdi-wide operations should be
distributed to all its wb's (bdi_writeback's).

This patch updates laptop_mode_timer_fn() so that it invokes
wb_start_writeback() on all wb's rather than just the root one.  As
the intent is writing out all dirty data, there's no reason to split
the number of pages to write.
