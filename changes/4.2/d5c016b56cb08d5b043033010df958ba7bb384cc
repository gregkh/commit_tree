ALSA: hda/ca0132: support for Alienware 15 Creative Sound Core3D-EX

This patch adds quirks detection to the Creative CA0132 codec, and the
quirk for Alienware 15 (2015).
Some quirks may need different pin configuration, so the relevant
compile-time configuration has been removed.
The pin configuration and related initialization verbs are generated at
runtime instead, in ca0132_config() and ca0132_prepare_verbs().
