s390/lcs: Fix null-pointer access in msg

An attempt to configure a CTC device as LCS results in the
following error message:

  (null): Detecting a network adapter for LCS devices failed
          with rc=-5 (0xfffffffb)

"(null)" results from access to &card->dev->dev in lcs_new_device()
which is only initialized later in the function. Fix this by using
&ccwgdev->dev instead which is initialized before lcs_new_device()
is called.
