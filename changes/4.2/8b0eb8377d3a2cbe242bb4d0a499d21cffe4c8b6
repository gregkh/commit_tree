pcmcia: Remove typedef in structs and emum

The Linux kernel coding style guidelines suggest not using typedefs
for structure and enum types. This patch gets rid of the typedefs for
cirrus_state_t, vg46x_state_t and pcic_id. Also, the names of the structs
are changed to drop the _t, to make the name look less typedef-like.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch detects the cases for struct type:

@tn@
identifier i;
type td;
@@

-typedef
 struct i { ... }
-td
 ;

@@
type tn.td;
identifier tn.i;
@@

-td
+ struct i
