MIPS: Octeon: Set OHCI and EHCI MMIO byte order to match CPU

The Octeon OHCI is now supported by the ohci-platform driver, and
USB_OCTEON_OHCI is marked as deprecated.  However, it is currently
still necessary to enable it in order to select
USB_OHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_MMIO.  Make CPU_CAVIUM_OCTEON select that as well,
so that USB_OCTEON_OHCI is really obsolete.

The old ohci-octeon and ehci-octeon drivers also only enabled big-endian
MMIO in case the CPU was big-endian.  Make the selections of
USB_EHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_MMIO and USB_OHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_MMIO conditional, to
match this.
