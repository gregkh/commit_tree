x86: introduce kaslr_offset()

Offset that has been chosen for kaslr during kernel decompression can be
easily computed as a difference between _text and __START_KERNEL. We are
already making use of this in dump_kernel_offset() notifier and in
arch_crash_save_vmcoreinfo().

Introduce kaslr_offset() that makes this computation instead of hard-coding
it, so that other kernel code (such as live patching) can make use of it.
Also convert existing users to make use of it.

This patch is equivalent transofrmation without any effects on the resulting
code:
