lustre: lov: Drop lov_lock_handles structure

The lov_lock_handles structure is only used as the type of the field
set_lockh in the lov_request_set structure, and this field is never set to
any value.  Drop a test and free of this field in lov_finish_set.  This
change enables also removing the functions lov_handle2llh and lov_llh_put
that manipulate values of type lov_lock_handles, but are now never called.
