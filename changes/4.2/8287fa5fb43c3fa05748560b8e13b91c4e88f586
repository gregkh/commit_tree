target/file: Remove fd_prot bounce buffer

The reason this bounce buffer exists is to allow code
reuse between rd_mcp and fileio in DIF mode. But the fact is,
that this bounce is really not needed at all, we can simply call
sbc_dif_verify on cmd->t_prot_sg and use it for file IO.

This also removes fd_do_prot_rw as fd_do_rw was generalised
to receive file pointer, block size (8 bytes for DIF data) and
total data length.

(Fix apply breakage from commit c836777 - nab)
