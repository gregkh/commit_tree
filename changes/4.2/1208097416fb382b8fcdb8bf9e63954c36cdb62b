staging: rtl8192e: fix some confusing indenting

The indenting here causes a static checker warning:

	drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib_rx.c:626 RxReorderIndicatePacket()
	warn: curly braces intended?

The code is actually correct, it's just that these lines were pushed in
an extra indent level by mistake in 35e33b0468ab ('staging: rtl8192e:
Fix LONG_LINE warnings').
