rcutorture: Exchange TREE03 and TREE04 geometries

Given that the combination of PREEMPT_RCU and HOTPLUG_CPU is producing the
most bugs lately, this commit swaps the TREE03 and TREE04 rcu_node-tree
geometries so that the test exercising PREEMPT_RCU and HOTPLUG_CPU has
three-level rather than two-level rcu_node trees.
