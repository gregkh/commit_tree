gpio: max732x: Fix irq-events handler

MAX732X clears all pending interrupts on I2C read (when interrupts
register is being read). Driver doesn't need to send any ACKs when
interrupt was handled. So replace handle_edge_irq() with
handle_simple_irq().

Using handle_edge_irq() (w/o .irq_ack callback set) may lead to NULL
pointer dereference in some cases. E.g. this was observed on
hibernation process:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0
  Backtrace:
