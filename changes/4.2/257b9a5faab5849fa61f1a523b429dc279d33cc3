KVM: x86: use correct APIC ID on x2APIC transition

SDM April 2015, 10.12.5 State Changes From xAPIC Mode to x2APIC Mode
â€¢ Any APIC ID value written to the memory-mapped local APIC ID register
  is not preserved.

Fix it by sourcing vcpu_id (= initial APIC ID) instead of memory-mapped
APIC ID.  Proper use of apic functions would result in two calls to
recalculate_apic_map(), so this patch makes a new helper.
