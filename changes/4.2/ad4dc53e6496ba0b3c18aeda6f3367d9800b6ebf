pnfs/flexfiles: add ff_layout_prepare_layoutstats

It fills in the generic part of LAYOUTSTATS call. One thing to note
is that we don't really track if IO is continuous or not. So just fake
to use the completed bytes for it.

Still missing flexfiles specific part, which will be included in the next patch.
