drm/i915: Dont clear PIN_GLOBAL in the execbuf pinning fallback

PIN_GLOBAL is set only when userspace asked for it, and that
is only the case for the gen6 PIPE_CONTROL workaround. We're not
allowed to just clear this.

The important part of the fallback is to drop the restriction to
the mappable range.

    drm/i915: Fallback to using CPU relocations for large batch buffers

v2: Chris pointed out that we also miss to set PIN_GLOBAL when the
buffer is already bound. Fix this up too.
