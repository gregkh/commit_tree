dm thin: allocate the cell_sort_array dynamically

Given the pool's cell_sort_array holds 8192 pointers it triggers an
order 5 allocation via kmalloc.  This order 5 allocation is prone to
failure as system memory gets more fragmented over time.

Fix this by allocating the cell_sort_array using vmalloc.
