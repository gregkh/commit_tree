powerpc: use for_each_sg()

This replaces the plain loop over the sglist array with for_each_sg()
macro which consists of sg_next() function calls.  Since powerpc does
select ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN, it is necessary to use for_each_sg() in order
to loop over each sg element.  This also help find problems with drivers
that do not properly initialize their sg tables when CONFIG_DEBUG_SG is
enabled.
