extcon: Unify the jig cable names on rt8973 and max14577/77693/77843

This patch change the name of various jig cables as 'JIG' because the name of
various jig cables are strange and ambiguous on user-space aspect. They include
the different information of either USB and UART state. It is never important
for user-space process. This patch unifies the name of jig cables as following:
- JIG-USB-ON   -->|--> JIG
- JIG-USB-OFF  -->|
- JIG-UART-ON  -->|
- JIG-UART-OFF -->|
