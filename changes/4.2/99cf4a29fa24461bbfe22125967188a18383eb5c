drm/atomic: Add current-mode blob to CRTC state

Add a blob property tracking the current mode to the CRTC state, and
ensure it is properly updated and referenced.

v2: Continue using crtc_state->mode inside getcrtc, instead of reading
    out the mode blob. Use IS_ERR and PTR_ERR from create_blob. Move
    set_mode_prop_for_crtc to later patch where it actually gets used.
    Enforce !!state->enable == !!state->mode_blob inside
    drm_atomic_crtc_check.
