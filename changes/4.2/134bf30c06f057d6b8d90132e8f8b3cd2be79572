dm cache policy smq: fix alloc_bitset check that always evaluates as false

static analysis by cppcheck has found a check on alloc_bitset that
always evaluates as false and hence never finds an allocation failure:

[drivers/md/dm-cache-policy-smq.c:1689]: (warning) Logical conjunction
  always evaluates to false: !EXPR && EXPR.

Fix this by removing the incorrect mq->cache_hit_bits check
