zpool: remove zpool_evict()

Remove zpool_evict() helper function.  As zbud is currently the only
zpool implementation that supports eviction, add zpool and zpool_ops
references to struct zbud_pool and directly call zpool_ops->evict(zpool,
handle) on eviction.

Currently zpool provides the zpool_evict helper which locks the zpool
list lock and searches through all pools to find the specific one
matching the caller, and call the corresponding zpool_ops->evict
function.  However, this is unnecessary, as the zbud pool can simply
keep a reference to the zpool that created it, as well as the zpool_ops,
and directly call the zpool_ops->evict function, when it needs to evict
a page.  This avoids a spinlock and list search in zpool for each
eviction.
