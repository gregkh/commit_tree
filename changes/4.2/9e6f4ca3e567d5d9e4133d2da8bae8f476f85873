sc16is7xx: use kthread_worker for tx_work and irq

Convert workqueue usage to a real-time kworker.  The problem
with workqueues is that we cannot set real-time priorities on
our work and asynchronous reconfiguration can be blocked by
less important tasks.

We need kthread for the interrupt anyway and because we will
now be using single kthread for all TX-related operations we
can get rid of the port mutex.
