ARM: 8359/1: correct secondary_startup_arm mode

secondary_startup_arm is used as ARM mode secondary start up function
when ther kernel is compiled in THUMB mode, however the label itself
is still in .thumb mode. readelf shows:

160979: c020a581   120 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    2 secondary_startup_arm

Make sure the label is in ARM mode as well.
