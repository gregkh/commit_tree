nfs: fix potential credential leak in ff_layout_update_mirror_cred

If we have two tasks racing to update a mirror's credentials, then they
can end up leaking one (or more) sets of credentials. The first task
will set mirror->cred and then the second task will just overwrite it.

Use a cmpxchg to ensure that the creds are only set once. If we get to
the point where we would set mirror->cred and find that they're already
set, then we just release the creds that were just found.
