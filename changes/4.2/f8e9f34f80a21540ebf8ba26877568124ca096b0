usb: musb: Fix up DMA related macros

Pass struct musb to tusb_dma_omap() and is_cppi_enabled(),
and add macros for the other DMA controllers. Populate the
platform specific quirks with the DMA type and use it during
runtime.

Note that platform glue layers with no custom DMA code are
tagged with MUSB_DMA_INVENTRA which may have a chance of
working. Looks like the defconfigs for these use PIO_ONLY,
so this should not break existing configs.
