i2c: bcm2835: clear reserved bits in S-Register

The datasheet mentions on page 31 that the bits 10-31 must be read as
don't care and written as 0.

We cannot guarantee that we read bits 10-31 as always 0 (because the
datasheet says read as don't care). We clear the bits with a bitmask to
prevent writing back unknown data at the reserved bits.
