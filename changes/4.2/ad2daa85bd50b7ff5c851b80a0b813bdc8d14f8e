arm64: entry32: remove pointless register assignment

We currently set x27 in compat_sys_sigreturn_wrapper and
compat_sys_rt_sigreturn_wrapper, similarly to what we do with r8/why on
32-bit ARM, in an attempt to prevent sigreturns from being restarted.

However, on arm64 we have always used pt_regs::syscallno for syscall
restarting (for both native and compat tasks), and x27 is never
inspected again before being overwritten in kernel_exit.

This patch removes the pointless register assignments.
