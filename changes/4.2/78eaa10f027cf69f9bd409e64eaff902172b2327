cpuidle: powernv/pseries: Auto-promotion of snooze to deeper idle state

The idle cpus which stay in snooze for a long period can degrade the
perfomance of the sibling cpus. If the cpu stays in snooze for more
than target residency of the next available idle state, then exit from
snooze. This gives a chance to the cpuidle governor to re-evaluate the
last idle state of the cpu to promote it to deeper idle states.
