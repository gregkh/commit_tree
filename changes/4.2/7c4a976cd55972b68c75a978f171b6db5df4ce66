clockevents: Allow set-state callbacks to be optional

Its mandatory for the drivers to provide set_state_{oneshot|periodic}()
(only if related modes are supported) and set_state_shutdown() callbacks
today, if they are implementing the new set-state interface.

But this leads to unnecessary noop callbacks for drivers which don't
want to implement them. Over that, it will lead to a full function call
for nothing really useful.

Lets make all set-state callbacks optional.
