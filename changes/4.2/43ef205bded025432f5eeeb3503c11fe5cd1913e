perf/x86/intel: Remove intel_excl_states::init_state

For some obscure reason intel_{start,stop}_scheduling() copy the HT
state to an intermediate array. This would make sense if we ever were
to make changes to it which we'd have to discard.

Except we don't. By the time we call intel_commit_scheduling() we're;
as the name implies; committed to them. We'll never back out.

A further hint its pointless is that stop_scheduling() unconditionally
publishes the state.

So the intermediate array is pointless, modify the state in place and
kill the extra array.

And remove the pointless array initialization: INTEL_EXCL_UNUSED == 0.

Note; all is serialized by intel_excl_cntr::lock.
