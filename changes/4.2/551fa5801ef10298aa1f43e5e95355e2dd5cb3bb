pinctrl: intel: sunrisepoint: Add Intel Sunrisepoint-H support

Intel Sunrisepoint-H is a desktop version of the PCH (Platform Controller
Hub). It has slightly different pin configuration compared to the LP
version. This patch adds support for Sunrisepoint-H to the existing
pinctrl-sunrisepoint.c driver.
