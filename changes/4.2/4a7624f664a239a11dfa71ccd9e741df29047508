drm/i915/chv: Extend set idle rps wa to chv

It is observed on BSW that requesting a new frequency from Punit
does nothing when the GPU is in rc6, and if we let GPU enter rc6
with a high frequency, Vnn remains slightly higher than at minimum
frequency. Extending vlv_set_rps_idle() workaround on CHV/BSW.
