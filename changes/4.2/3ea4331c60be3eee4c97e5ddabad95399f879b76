check_syslog_permissions() cleanup

Patch fixes drawbacks in heck_syslog_permissions() noticed by AKPM:
"from_file handling makes me cry.

That's not a boolean - it's an enumerated value with two values
currently defined.

But the code in check_syslog_permissions() treats it as a boolean and
also hardwires the knowledge that SYSLOG_FROM_PROC == 1 (or == `true`).

And the name is wrong: it should be called from_proc to match
SYSLOG_FROM_PROC."
