libnvdimm: support for legacy (non-aliasing) nvdimms

The libnvdimm region driver is an intermediary driver that translates
non-volatile "region"s into "namespace" sub-devices that are surfaced by
persistent memory block-device drivers (PMEM and BLK).

ACPI 6 introduces the concept that a given nvdimm may simultaneously
offer multiple access modes to its media through direct PMEM load/store
access, or windowed BLK mode.  Existing nvdimms mostly implement a PMEM
interface, some offer a BLK-like mode, but never both as ACPI 6 defines.
If an nvdimm is single interfaced, then there is no need for dimm
metadata labels.  For these devices we can take the region boundaries
directly to create a child namespace device (nd_namespace_io).
