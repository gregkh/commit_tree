drm/i915: index gmbus tables using the pin pair number

Index the gmbus tables directly using the pin instead of having a
confusing "port = i + 1" mapping. This finishes off removing the "gmbus
port" as a notion, and leaves us with just the "gmbus pin".

As pin 0 is invalid by definition and the gmbus tables will have a gap
at that index, add pin validity check to all the loops. This will be
benefitial for supporting platforms that have different numbers of pins,
or gaps.
