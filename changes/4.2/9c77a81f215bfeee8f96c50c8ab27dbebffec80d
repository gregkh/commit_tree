memory: tegra: Add EMC frequency debugfs entry

This file in debugfs can be used to get or set the EMC frequency.
Reading the file will return the currently set frequency in Hz, while
writing the file sets the specified frequency rounded to the next
highest frequency supported by the board.

Will be very useful when tuning memory scaling.
