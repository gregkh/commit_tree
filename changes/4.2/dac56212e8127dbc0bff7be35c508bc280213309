bio: skip atomic inc/dec of ->bi_cnt for most use cases

Struct bio has a reference count that controls when it can be freed.
Most uses cases is allocating the bio, which then returns with a
single reference to it, doing IO, and then dropping that single
reference. We can remove this atomic_dec_and_test() in the completion
path, if nobody else is holding a reference to the bio.

If someone does call bio_get() on the bio, then we flag the bio as
now having valid count and that we must properly honor the reference
count when it's being put.
