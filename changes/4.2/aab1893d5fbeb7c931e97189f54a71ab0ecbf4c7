Add SMB3.11 mount option synonym for new dialect

Most people think of SMB 3.1.1 as SMB version 3.11 so add synonym
for "vers=3.1.1" of "vers=3.11" on mount.

Also make sure that unlike SMB3.0 and 3.02 we don't send
validate negotiate on mount (it is handled by negotiate contexts) -
add list of SMB3.11 specific functions (distinct from 3.0 dialect).
