btrfs: qgroup: Fix possible leak in btrfs_add_qgroup_relation()

Commit 9c8b35b1ba21 ("btrfs: quota: Automatically update related qgroups or
mark INCONSISTENT flags when assigning/deleting a qgroup relations.")
introduced the allocation of a temporary ulist in function
btrfs_add_qgroup_relation() and added the corresponding cleanup to the out
path. However, the allocation was introduced before the src/dst level check
that directly returns. Fix the possible leakage of the ulist by moving the
allocation after the input validation. Detected by Coverity CID 1295988.
