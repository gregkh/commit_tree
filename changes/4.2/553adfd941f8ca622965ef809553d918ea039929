ceph: track pending caps flushing accurately

Previously we do not trace accurate TID for flushing caps. when
MDS failovers, we have no choice but to re-send all flushing caps
with a new TID. This can cause problem because MDS can has already
flushed some caps and has issued the same caps to other client.
The re-sent cap flush has a new TID, which makes MDS unable to
detect if it has already processed the cap flush.

This patch adds code to track pending caps flushing accurately.
When re-sending cap flush is needed, we use its original flush
TID.
