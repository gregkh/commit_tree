Input: goodix - export id and version read from device

Goodix touchscreens export through their registers a Product ID and
Firmware Version. The Product ID is an ASCII encoding of the product name
(e.g.: "911").

Export to sysfs (through the input subsystem) the product id and firmware
version read from the device rather than using constant values.
