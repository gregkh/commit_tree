xfs: switch remaining xfs_trans_dup users to xfs_trans_roll

We have three remaining callers of xfs_trans_dup:

 - xfs_itruncate_extents which open codes xfs_trans_roll
 - xfs_bmap_finish doesn't have an xfs_inode argument and thus leaves
   attaching them to it's callers, but otherwise is identical to
   xfs_trans_roll
 - xfs_dir_ialloc looks at the log reservations in the old xfs_trans
   structure instead of the log reservation parameters, but otherwise
   is identical to xfs_trans_roll.

By allowing a NULL xfs_inode argument to xfs_trans_roll we can switch
these three remaining users over to xfs_trans_roll and mark xfs_trans_dup
static.
