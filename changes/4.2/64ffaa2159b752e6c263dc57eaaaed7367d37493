net/mlx5_core,mlx5_ib: Do not use vmap() on coherent memory

As David Daney pointed in mlx4_core driver [1], mlx5_core is also
misusing the DMA-API.

This patch is removing the code that vmap() memory allocated by
dma_alloc_coherent().

After this patch, users of this drivers might fail allocating resources
on memory fragmeneted systems.  This will be fixed later on.
