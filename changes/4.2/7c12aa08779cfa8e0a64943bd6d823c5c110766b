amd-xgbe: Move the PHY support into amd-xgbe

The AMD XGBE device is intended to work with a specific integrated PHY
and that PHY is not meant to be a standalone PHY for use by other
devices. As such this patch removes the phylib driver and implements
the PHY support in the amd-xgbe driver (the majority of the logic from
the phylib driver is moved into the amd-xgbe driver).

Update the driver version to 1.0.1.
