ARM: 8394/1: update memblock limit after mapping lowmem

The memblock limit is currently used in find_limits
to find the bounds for ZONE_NORMAL. The memblock
limit may need to be rounded down a PMD size to ensure
allocations are fully mapped though. This has the side
effect of reducing the amount of memory in ZONE_NORMAL.
Once all lowmem is mapped, it's safe to change the memblock
limit back to include the unaligned section. Adjust the
memblock limit after lowmem mapping is complete.

Before:
 # cat /proc/zoneinfo | grep managed
        managed  62907
        managed  424

After:
 # cat /proc/zoneinfo | grep managed
        managed  63331
