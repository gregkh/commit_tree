sched/numa: Reduce conflict between fbq_classify_rq() and migration

It is possible for fbq_classify_rq() to indicate that a CPU has tasks that
should be moved to another NUMA node, but for migrate_improves_locality
and migrate_degrades_locality to not identify those tasks.

This patch always gives preference to preferred node evaluations, and
only checks the number of faults when evaluating moves between two
non-preferred nodes on a larger NUMA system.

On a two node system, the number of faults is never evaluated. Either
a task is about to be pulled off its preferred node, or migrated onto
it.
