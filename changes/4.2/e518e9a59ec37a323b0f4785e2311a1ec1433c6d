checkpatch: emit an error when there's a diff in a changelog

People often put diff snippets in changelogs.  This causes problems
when one tries to apply a file containing both the changelog and the
diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff which it found in the
changelog.

Warn once when what seems to be a diff snippet in the changelog exists.
