netlink: mmap: fix tx type check

I can't send netlink message via mmaped netlink socket since

    commit: a8866ff6a5bce7d0ec465a63bc482a85c09b0d39
    netlink: make the check for "send from tx_ring" deterministic

msg->msg_iter.type is set to WRITE (1) at

    SYSCALL_DEFINE6(sendto, ...
        import_single_range(WRITE, ...
            iov_iter_init(1, WRITE, ...

call path, so that we need to check the type by iter_is_iovec()
to accept the WRITE.
