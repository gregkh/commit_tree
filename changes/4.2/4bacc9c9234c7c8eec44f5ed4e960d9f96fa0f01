overlayfs: Make f_path always point to the overlay and f_inode to the underlay

Make file->f_path always point to the overlay dentry so that the path in
/proc/pid/fd is correct and to ensure that label-based LSMs have access to the
overlay as well as the underlay (path-based LSMs probably don't need it).

Using my union testsuite to set things up, before the patch I see:

	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# bash 5</mnt/a/foo107
	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# ls -l /proc/$$/fd/
	...
	lr-x------. 1 root root 64 Jun  5 14:38 5 -> /a/foo107
	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# stat /mnt/a/foo107
	...
	Device: 23h/35d Inode: 13381       Links: 1
	...
	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# stat -L /proc/$$/fd/5
	...
	Device: 23h/35d Inode: 13381       Links: 1
	...

After the patch:

	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# bash 5</mnt/a/foo107
	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# ls -l /proc/$$/fd/
	...
	lr-x------. 1 root root 64 Jun  5 14:22 5 -> /mnt/a/foo107
	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# stat /mnt/a/foo107
	...
	Device: 23h/35d Inode: 40346       Links: 1
	...
	[root@andromeda union-testsuite]# stat -L /proc/$$/fd/5
	...
	Device: 23h/35d Inode: 40346       Links: 1
	...

Note the change in where /proc/$$/fd/5 points to in the ls command.  It was
pointing to /a/foo107 (which doesn't exist) and now points to /mnt/a/foo107
(which is correct).

The inode accessed, however, is the lower layer.  The union layer is on device
25h/37d and the upper layer on 24h/36d.
