fm10k: fix iov_msg_lport_state_pf issue

When a VF issues an LPORT_STATE request to enable a port that is already
enabled, the PF will first disable the VF LPORT. Then it should
re-enable the VF again with the new requested settings. This ensures
that any switch rules are cleared by deleting the LPORT on the switch.
However, the flow is bugged because we actually check if the VF is
enabled at the end, and thus don't re-enable it. Fix the flow so that we
actually clear the enabled flags as part of our removal of the LPORT.
