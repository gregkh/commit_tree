drm: omapdrm: Simplify IRQ registration

The omapdrm can't use drm_irq_install() and drm_irq_uninstall() as it
delegates IRQ handling to the omapdss driver. However, the code still
declares IRQ-related operations used by the DRM IRQ helpers, and calls
them indirectly.

Simplify the implementation by calling the functions directly or
inlining them. The irq_enabled checks can then also be simplified as
the call stacks guarantees that omap_drm_irq_install() and
omap_drm_irq_uninstall() will never run concurrently.
