IB/core: Change provider's API of create_cq to be extendible

Add a new ib_cq_init_attr structure which contains the
previous cqe (minimum number of CQ entries) and comp_vector
(completion vector) in addition to a new flags field.
All vendors' create_cq callbacks are changed in order
to work with the new API.

This commit does not change any functionality.
