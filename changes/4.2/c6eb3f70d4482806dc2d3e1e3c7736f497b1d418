hrtimer: Get rid of hrtimer softirq

hrtimer softirq is a leftover from the initial implementation and
serves only the purpose to handle the enqueueing of already expired
timers in the high resolution timer mode. We discussed whether we
change the return value and force all start sites to handle that the
timer is already expired, but that would be a Herculean task and I'm
not sure whether its a good idea to enforce that handling on
everyone.

A simpler solution is to enforce a timer interrupt instead of raising
and scheduling a softirq. Just use the existing infrastructure to do
so and remove all the softirq leftovers.

The HRTIMER softirq enum is now unused, but kept around because trace
parsers rely on the existing numbering.
