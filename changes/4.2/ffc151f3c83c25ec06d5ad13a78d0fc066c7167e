Drivers: hv: vmbus: do cleanup on all vmbus_open() failure paths

In case there was an error reported in the response to the CHANNELMSG_OPENCHANNEL
call we need to do the cleanup as a vmbus_open() user won't be doing it after
receiving an error. The cleanup should be done on all failure paths. We also need
to avoid returning open_info->response.open_result.status as the return value as
all other errors we return from vmbus_open() are -EXXX and vmbus_open() callers
are not supposed to analyze host error codes.
