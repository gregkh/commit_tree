tcp: fill shinfo->gso_type at last moment

Our goal is to touch skb_shinfo(skb) only when absolutely needed,
to avoid two cache line misses in TCP output path for last skb
that is considered but not sent because of various conditions
(cwnd, tso defer, receiver window, TSQ...)

A packet is GSO only when skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size is not zero.

We can set skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_type to sk->sk_gso_type even for
non GSO packets.
