KVM: s390: fix external call injection without sigp interpretation

Commit ea5f49692575 ("KVM: s390: only one external call may be pending
at a time") introduced a bug on machines that don't have SIGP
interpretation facility installed.
The injection of an external call will now always fail with -EBUSY
(if none is already pending).

This leads to the following symptoms:
- An external call will be injected but with the wrong "src cpu id",
  as this id will not be remembered.
- The target vcpu will not be woken up, therefore the guest will hang if
  it cannot deal with unexpected failures of the SIGP EXTERNAL CALL
  instruction.
- If an external call is already pending, -EBUSY will not be reported.
