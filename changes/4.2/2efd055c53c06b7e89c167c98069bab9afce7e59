tcp: add tcpi_segs_in and tcpi_segs_out to tcp_info

This patch tracks the total number of inbound and outbound segments on a
TCP socket. One may use this number to have an idea on connection
quality when compared against the retransmissions.

RFC4898 named these : tcpEStatsPerfSegsIn and tcpEStatsPerfSegsOut

These are a 32bit field each and can be fetched both from TCP_INFO
getsockopt() if one has a handle on a TCP socket, or from inet_diag
netlink facility (iproute2/ss patch will follow)

Note that tp->segs_out was placed near tp->snd_nxt for good data
locality and minimal performance impact, while tp->segs_in was placed
near tp->bytes_received for the same reason.

Join work with Eric Dumazet.

Note that received SYN are accounted on the listener, but sent SYNACK
are not accounted.
