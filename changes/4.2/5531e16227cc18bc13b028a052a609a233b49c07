perf session: Print a newline when dumping PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND

With 'perf report -D' the PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND event was printed
without a newline, resulting in:

	0x91a18 [0x8]: PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUNDAggregated stats

Other events print their details, but PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND doesn't
have any so just add a print for a newline.
