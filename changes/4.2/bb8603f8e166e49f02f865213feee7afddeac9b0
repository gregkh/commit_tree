link_path_walk: get rid of duplication

What we do after the second walk_component() + put_link() + depth
decrement in there is exactly equivalent to what's done right
after the first walk_component().  Easy to verify and not at all
surprising, seeing that there we have just walked the last
component of nested symlink.
