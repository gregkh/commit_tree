tracing: Export tracing clock functions

Critical tracepoint hooks should never call anything that takes a lock,
so they are unable to call getrawmonotonic() or ktime_get().

Export the rest of the tracing clock functions so can be used in
tracepoint hooks.

Background: We have a customer that adds their own module and registers
a tracepoint hook to sched_wakeup. They were using ktime_get() for a
time source, but it grabs a seq lock and caused a deadlock to occur.
