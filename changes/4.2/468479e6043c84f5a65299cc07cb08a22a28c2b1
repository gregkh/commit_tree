packet: avoid out of bounds read in round robin fanout

PACKET_FANOUT_LB computes f->rr_cur such that it is modulo
f->num_members. It returns the old value unconditionally, but
f->num_members may have changed since the last store. Ensure
that the return value is always < num.

When modifying the logic, simplify it further by replacing the loop
with an unconditional atomic increment.
