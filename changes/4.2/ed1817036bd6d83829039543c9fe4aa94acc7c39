drm: fix a memleak on mutex failure path

Need to free just allocated ctx allocation if we cannot
get our config mutex.

This one has been flagged by kbuild bot all the way back in August,
but somehow nobody picked it up:
https://lists.01.org/pipermail/kbuild/2014-August/001691.html

In addition there is another failure path that leaks the same
ctx reference that is fixed.

Found with smatch.
