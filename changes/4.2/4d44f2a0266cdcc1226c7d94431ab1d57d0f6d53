arm: dts: vexpress: describe all PMUs in TC2 dts

The dts for the CoreTile Express A15x2 A7x3 (TC2) only describes the
PMUs of the Cortex-A15 CPUs, and not the Cortex-A7 CPUs.

Now that we have a mechanism for describing disparate PMUs and their
interrupts in device tree, this patch makes use of these to describe the
PMUs for all CPUs in the system. For consistency, the existing A15 PMU
interrupt-affinity property is reflowed across two lines.
