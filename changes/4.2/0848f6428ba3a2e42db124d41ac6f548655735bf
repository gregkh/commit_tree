inet: frags: fix defragmented packet's IP header for af_packet

When ip_frag_queue() computes positions, it assumes that the passed
sk_buff does not contain L2 headers.

However, when PACKET_FANOUT_FLAG_DEFRAG is used, IP reassembly
functions can be called on outgoing packets that contain L2 headers.

Also, IPv4 checksum is not corrected after reassembly.

Fixes: 7736d33f4262 ("packet: Add pre-defragmentation support for ipv4 fanouts.")
