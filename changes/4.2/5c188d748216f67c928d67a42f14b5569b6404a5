mfd: twl4030-power: Fix pmic for boards that need AC charger disabled

I noticed the PMIC configuration on 37xx-evm won't actually shut down
the voltages during off-idle. Turns out 37xx-evm needs the AC charger
state transitions disabled like we are doing for SDP and LDP in the
legacy booting case.

Let's fix this for device tree based booting by setting up the quirk
flag based on the compatible flag. And let's also use the existing
define for STARTON_CHG.

Note that SDP and EVM do not have the PMIC clken wired to gate the
the oscillator while LDP has.
