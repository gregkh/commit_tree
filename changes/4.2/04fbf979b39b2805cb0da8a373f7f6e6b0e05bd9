rtl8188eu: don't duplicate ieee80211 constants for status/reason

These are all defined as a part of the standard and should not be
duplicated on a per-driver basis.  Use the global ones and delete the
local ones.

Note that a couple of them had slight wording differences, things like
INVALID vs. NOT_VALID or similar, so they are aligned with the global
naming conventions here, as dictated by compile testing.

This isn't the totality of duplicated data removed, but it is a start.
