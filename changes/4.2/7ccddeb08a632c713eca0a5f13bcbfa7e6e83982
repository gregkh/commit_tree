mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Do not break platform data boards

The only user of this driver that has not been converted to fully
device tree is the i.MX35 SoC.

There is a i.MX35-based board (mach-pcm043.c) that uses platform data
to pass wp_gpio and cd_gpio information.

Commit 8d86e4fcccf61ba ("mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Call mmc_of_parse()")
broke the platform data case by removing mmc_gpio_request_ro() and
mmc_gpio_request_cd(), so restore the functionality for the non-dt
case.

Also, restore the check for ESDHC_CD_CONTROLLER so that we can still
support the "fsl,cd-controller" property.
