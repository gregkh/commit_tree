hpsa: hpsa decode sense data for io and tmf

In hba mode, we could get sense data in descriptor format so
we need to handle that.

It's possible for CommandStatus to have value 0x0D
"TMF Function Status", which we should handle.  We will get
this from a P1224 when aborting a non-existent tag, for
example.  The "ScsiStatus" field of the errinfo field
will contain the TMF function status value.
