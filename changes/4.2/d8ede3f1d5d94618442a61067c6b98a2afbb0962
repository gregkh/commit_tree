staging/lustre/llite: make llite/lov and lmv symlinks

old proc code had /proc/sys/fs/lustre/llite/.../lov and lmv
dirs that contained name of the dir in lustre/lov and lustre/lmv
to better be able to find correct obd device there, but
I imagien a better solution would be to just create a symlink with
the same name. The name is then pointless and the target dir would
have uuid file just as if it was the old-style dir.
