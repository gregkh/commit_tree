Btrfs: remove csum_bytes_left

After commit 8407f553268a
("Btrfs: fix data corruption after fast fsync and writeback error"),
during wait_ordered_extents(), we wait for ordered extent setting
BTRFS_ORDERED_IO_DONE or BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR, at which point we've
already got checksum information, so we don't need to check
(csum_bytes_left == 0) in the whole logging path.
