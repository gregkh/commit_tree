dmaenegine: edma: allow pause/resume for non-cyclic mode

The 8250_omap serial driver relies on dmaengine_pause() actually
pausing the DMA transfer. Before this patch dmaengine_pause() is
a NOP for non-cylic DMA transfers. This allowed the 8250_omap
driver to read DMA buffers while the DMA was still active,
resulting in lost serial data.
