signalfd: fix information leak in signalfd_copyinfo

This function may copy the si_addr_lsb field to user mode when it hasn't
been initialized, which can leak kernel stack data to user mode.

Just checking the value of si_code is insufficient because the same
si_code value is shared between multiple signals.  This is solved by
checking the value of si_signo in addition to si_code.
