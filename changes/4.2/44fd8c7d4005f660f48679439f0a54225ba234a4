ARM: socfpga: support suspend to ram

Add code that requests that the sdr controller go into
self-refresh mode.  This code is run from ocram.

Suspend-to-RAM and EDAC support are mutually exclusive on
SOCFPGA.  If the EDAC is enabled, it will prevent the
platform from going into suspend.

Example of how to request to suspend to ram:
 $ echo enabled > \
/sys/devices/soc/ffc02000.serial0/tty/ttyS0/power/wakeup

 $ echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
