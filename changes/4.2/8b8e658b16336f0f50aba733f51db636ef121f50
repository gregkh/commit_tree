macvtap/tun: cross-endian support for little-endian hosts

The VNET_LE flag was introduced to fix accesses to virtio 1.0 headers
that are always little-endian. It can also be used to handle the special
case of a legacy little-endian device implemented by a big-endian host.

Let's add a flag and ioctls for big-endian devices as well. If both flags
are set, little-endian wins.

Since this is isn't a common usecase, the feature is controlled by a kernel
config option (not set by default).

Both macvtap and tun are covered by this patch since they share the same
API with userland.
