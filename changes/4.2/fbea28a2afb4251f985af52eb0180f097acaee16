dmaengine: mv_xor: improve descriptors list handling and reduce locking

This patch change the way free descriptors are marked.

Instead of having a field for descriptor in use, all the descriptors in the
all_slots list are free for use.

This simplify the allocation method and reduce the locking needed.
