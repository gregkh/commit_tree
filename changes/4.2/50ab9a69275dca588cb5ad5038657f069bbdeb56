kbuild: include core debug info when DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED

With CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED, we do get quite a lot of debug info
(around 22.7 MB for a defconfig+DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED). However, the
"basenames must match" rule used by -femit-struct-debug-baseonly
option means that we miss some core data structures, such as struct
{device, file, inode, mm_struct, page} etc.

We can easily get these included as well, while still getting the
benefits of CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED (faster build times and smaller
individual object files): All it takes is a dummy translation unit
including a few strategic headers and compiled with a flag overriding
-femit-struct-debug-baseonly.

This increases the size of .debug_info by ~0.3%, but these 90 KB
contain some rather useful info.
