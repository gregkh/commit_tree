phy: twl4030-usb: remove incorrect pm_runtime_get_sync() in probe function.

The USB phy should initialize with power-off, and will be powered on
by the USB system when a cable connection is detected.

Having this pm_runtime_get_sync() during probe causes the phy to
*always* be powered on.
Removing it returns to sensible power management.
