perf auxtrace: Add support for AUX area recording

Add support for reading from the AUX area tracing mmap and synthesizing
AUX area tracing events.

This patch introduces an abstraction for recording AUX area data.

Recording is initialized by auxtrace_record__init() which is a weak
function to be implemented by the architecture to provide recording
callbacks.

Recording is mainly handled by auxtrace_mmap__read() and
perf_event__synthesize_auxtrace() but there are callbacks for
miscellaneous needs including validating and processing user options,
populating private data in auxtrace_info_event, and freeing the
structure when finished.
