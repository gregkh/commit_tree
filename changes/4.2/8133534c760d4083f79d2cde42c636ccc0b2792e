net: limit tcp/udp rmem/wmem to SOCK_{RCV,SND}BUF_MIN

This is similar to b1cb59cf2efe(net: sysctl_net_core: check SNDBUF
and RCVBUF for min length). I don't think too small values can cause
crashes in the case of udp and tcp, but I've seen this set to too
small values which triggered awful performance. It also makes the
setting consistent across all the wmem/rmem sysctls.
