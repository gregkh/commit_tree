sched/numa: Fix numa balancing stats in /proc/pid/sched

Commit 44dba3d5d6a1 ("sched: Refactor task_struct to use
numa_faults instead of numa_* pointers") modified the way
tsk->numa_faults stats are accounted.

However that commit never touched show_numa_stats() that is displayed
in /proc/pid/sched and thus the numbers displayed in /proc/pid/sched
don't match the actual numbers.

Fix it by making sure that /proc/pid/sched reflects the task
fault numbers. Also add group fault stats too.

Also couple of more modifications are added here:

1. Format changes:

  - Previously we would list two entries per node, one for private
    and one for shared. Also the home node info was listed in each entry.

  - Now preferred node, total_faults and current node are
    displayed separately.

  - Now there is one entry per node, that lists private,shared task and
    group faults.

2. Unit changes:

  - p->numa_pages_migrated was getting reset after every read of
    /proc/pid/sched. It's more useful to have absolute numbers since
    differential migrations between two accesses can be more easily
    calculated.
