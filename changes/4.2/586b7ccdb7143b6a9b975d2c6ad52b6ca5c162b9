KVM: s390: Fix hang VCPU hang/loop regression

commit 785dbef407d8 ("KVM: s390: optimize round trip time in request
handling") introduced a regression. This regression was seen with
CPU hotplug in the guest and switching between 1 or 2 CPUs. This will
set/reset the IBS control via synced request.

Whenever we make a synced request, we first set the vcpu->requests
bit and then block the vcpu. The handler, on the other hand, unblocks
itself, processes vcpu->requests (by clearing them) and unblocks itself
once again.

Now, if the requester sleeps between setting of vcpu->requests and
blocking, the handler will clear the vcpu->requests bit and try to
unblock itself (although no bit is set). When the requester wakes up,
it blocks the VCPU and we have a blocked VCPU without requests.

Solution is to always unset the block bit.
