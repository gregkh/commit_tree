LSM: Add security module hook list heads

Add a list header for each security hook. They aren't used until
later in the patch series. They are grouped together in a structure
so that there doesn't need to be an external address for each.

Macro-ize the initialization of the security_operations
for each security module in anticipation of changing out
the security_operations structure.
