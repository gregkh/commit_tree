clk: sunxi: Add support for the usb-clk on sun8i a23 and a33 SoCs

The usb-clk on sun8i a23 and a33 SoCs is similar to the ones found
on sun6i-a31 SoCs but instead of a 3th phy the a23 / a33 have a hsic
interface which gets enabled by almost the same bits as used on
the a31 for the 3rd phy, but not exactly the same bits so we need
a new compatible for this.
