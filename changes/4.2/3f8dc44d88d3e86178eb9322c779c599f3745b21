cxl: Fix refcounting in kernel API

Currently the kernel API AFU dev refcounting is done on context start and stop.
This patch moves this refcounting to context init and release, bringing it
inline with how the userspace API does it.

Without this we've seen the refcounting on the AFU get out of whack between the
user and kernel API usage.  This causes the AFU structures to be freed when
they are actually still in use.

This fixes some kref warnings we've been seeing and spurious ErrIVTE IRQs.
