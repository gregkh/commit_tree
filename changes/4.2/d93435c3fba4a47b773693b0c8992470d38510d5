zram: check comp algorithm availability earlier

Improvement idea by Marcin Jabrzyk.

comp_algorithm_store() silently accepts any supplied algorithm name,
because zram performs algorithm availability check later, during the
device configuration phase in disksize_store() and emits the following
error:

  "zram: Cannot initialise %s compressing backend"

this error line is somewhat generic and, besides, can indicate a failed
attempt to allocate compression backend's working buffers.

add algorithm availability check to comp_algorithm_store():

  echo lzz > /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm
  -bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
