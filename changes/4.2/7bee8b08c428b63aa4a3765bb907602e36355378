Bluetooth: btbcm: allow btbcm_read_verbose_config to fail on Apple

Commit 1c8ba6d013 moved around the setup code for broadcomm chips,
and also added btbcm_read_verbose_config() to read extra information
about the hardware.  It's returning errors on some macbooks:

Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: Read verbose config info failed (-16)

Which makes us error out of the setup function.  Since this
probe isn't critical to operate the chip, this patch just changes
things to carry on when it fails.
