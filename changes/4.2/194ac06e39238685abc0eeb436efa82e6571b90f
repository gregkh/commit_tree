net: netcp: fix improper initialization in netcp_ndo_open()

The keystone qmss will raise interrupt when packet arrive at the
receive queue. Only control available to avoid interrupt from happening
is to keep the free descriptor queue (FDQ) empty in the receive side.
So the filling of descriptors into the FDQ has to happen after
request_irq() call is made as part of knav_queue_enable_notify(). So
move the function netcp_rxpool_refill() after this call.
