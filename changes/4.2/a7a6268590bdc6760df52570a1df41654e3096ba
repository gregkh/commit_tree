stmmac: fix setting of driver data in stmmac_dvr_probe

Commit 803f8fc46274b ("stmmac: move driver data setting into
stmmac_dvr_probe") mistakenly set priv and not priv->dev as
driver data. This meant that the remove, resume and suspend
callbacks that fetched and tried to use this data would most
likely explode. Fix the issue by using the correct variable.
