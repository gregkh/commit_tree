       drm/i915/skl: Query display address through a wrapper

This worked by a mix of direct flag manipulation and checking for
existence of a pinned GGTT VMA.

With the introduction of rotated display mappings this approach is
no longer correct.

New simpler approach is to just keep this count over calls which pin
and unpin objects to and from display, at the slight cost of extra
space in every bo.

(Inspired and extracted code from a larger rework by Chris Wilson.)
