spi: bcm2835: change timeout of polling driver to 1s

The way that the timeout code is written in the polling function
the timeout does also trigger when interrupted or rescheduled while
in the polling loop.

This patch changes the timeout from effectively 20ms (=2 jiffies) to
1 second and removes the time that the transfer really takes out of
the computation, as - per design - this is <30us and the jiffie resolution
is 10ms so that does not make any difference what so ever.
