iio: core: Introduce IIO_CHAN_INFO_CALIBEMISSIVITY

Contact-less IR temperature sensors measure the temperature of an object
by using its thermal radiation.  Surfaces with different emissivity
ratios emit different amounts of energy at the same temperature.

IIO_CHAN_INFO_CALIBEMISSIVITY allows the user to inform the sensor of the
emissivity of the object in front of it, in order to effectively measure
its temperature.

A device providing such setting is Melexis's MLX90614:
