rcu: Convert from rcu_preempt_state to *rcu_state_p

It would be good to move more code from #ifdef to IS_ENABLED(), but
that does not work if the body of the IS_ENABLED() "if" statement
references a variable (such as rcu_preempt_state) that does not
exist if the IS_ENABLED() Kconfig variable is not set.  This commit
therefore substitutes *rcu_state_p for all uses of rcu_preempt_state
in kernel/rcu/tree_preempt.h, which should enable elimination of
a few #ifdefs.
