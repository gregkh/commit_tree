ARM: dts: Use last parent for clocks during power domain on/off

Replace fixed parent with last parent (obtained with clk_get_parent())
of clocks for devices in mfc and disp power domains. This should improve
behavior if such clocks were reparented by the drivers and new parents
are different than those specified in DTS.
