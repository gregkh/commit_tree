[media] bdisp: remove needless check

As reported by smatch:
	drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-v4l2.c:947 bdisp_s_selection() warn: unsigned 'out.width' is never less than zero.
	drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-v4l2.c:947 bdisp_s_selection() warn: unsigned 'out.height' is never less than zero.
