intel_pstate: set BYT MSR with wrmsrl_on_cpu()

Commit 007bea098b86 (intel_pstate: Add setting voltage value for
baytrail P states.) introduced byt_set_pstate() with the assumption that
it would always be run by the CPU whose MSR is to be written by it.  It
turns out, however, that is not always the case in practice, so modify
byt_set_pstate() to enforce the MSR write done by it to always happen on
the right CPU.
