crypto: jitterentropy - remove timekeeping_valid_for_hres

The patch removes the use of timekeeping_valid_for_hres which is now
marked as internal for the time keeping subsystem. The jitterentropy
does not really require this verification as a coarse timer (when
random_get_entropy is absent) is discovered by the initialization test
of jent_entropy_init, which would cause the jitter rng to not load in
that case.
