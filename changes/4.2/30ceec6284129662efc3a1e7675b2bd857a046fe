FS-Cache: When submitting an op, cancel it if the target object is dying

When submitting an operation, prefer to cancel the operation immediately
rather than queuing it for later processing if the object is marked as dying
(ie. the object state machine has reached the KILL_OBJECT state).

Whilst we're at it, change the series of related test_bit() calls into a
READ_ONCE() and bitwise-AND operators to reduce the number of load
instructions (test_bit() has a volatile address).
