ALSA: hda - Fix Skylake codec timeout

When the controller is powered up but the HDMI codec is powered down
on Skylake, the power well is turned off. When the codec is then
powered up again, we need to poke the codec a little extra to make
sure it wakes up. Otherwise we'll get sad "no response from codec"
messages and broken audio.

This also changes azx_runtime_resume to actually call
snd_hdac_set_codec_wakeup for Skylake (before STATETS read).
(Otherwise it would only have been called for Haswell and Broadwell,
which both do not need it, so this probably was not the author's
intention.)
