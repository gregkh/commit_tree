thermal: exynos: Add the support for Exynos5433 TMU

This patch adds the support for Exynos5433's TMU (Thermal Management Unit).
Exynos5433 has a little different register bit fields as following description:
- Support the eight trip points for rising/falling interrupt by using two registers
- Read the calibration type (1-point or 2-point) and sensor id from TRIMINFO register
- Use a little different register address
