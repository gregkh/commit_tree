scsi: ufs: provide a quirk to disable the LCC

LCC (Line Control Command) are being used for communication between
UFS host and UFS device.
New commercial UFS devices don't have the issues with LCC processing
but UFS host controller might still have the issue with LCC processing,
hence, added a routine to disable TX LCC on the device.
