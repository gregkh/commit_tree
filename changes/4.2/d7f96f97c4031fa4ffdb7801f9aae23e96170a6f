firmware: dmi_scan: add SBMIOS entry and DMI tables

Some utils, like dmidecode and smbios, need to access SMBIOS entry
table area in order to get information like SMBIOS version, size, etc.
Currently it's done via /dev/mem. But for situation when /dev/mem
usage is disabled, the utils have to use dmi sysfs instead, which
doesn't represent SMBIOS entry and adds code/delay redundancy when direct
access for table is needed.

So this patch creates dmi/tables and adds SMBIOS entry point to allow
utils in question to work correctly without /dev/mem. Also patch adds
raw dmi table to simplify dmi table processing in user space, as
proposed by Jean Delvare.
