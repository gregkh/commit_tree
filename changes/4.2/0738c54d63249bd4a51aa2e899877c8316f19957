drivers: net: xgene: Fix the ACPI support for RGMII/SGMII0/XFI interface of APM X-Gene SoC ethernet controller.

This patch implements couple of fixes to support ACPI for RGMII/SGMII0/XFI
interface of APM X-Gene SoC ethernet controller driver. This patch uses
the _SUN acpi object to fetch the port-id information whereas the FDT uses
port-id binding for port-id information.
