HID: wacom: Enable pad device for older Bamboo Touch tablets

Commit 862cf55 ("HID: wacom: Introduce a new WACOM_DEVICETYPE_PAD device_type")
neglected to set the WACOM_DEVICETYPE_PAD flag for older two-finger Bamboo
Touch tablets. Not only does this result in the pad device not appearing when
such a tablet is plugged in, but also causes a segfault when 'wacom_bpt_touch'
tries to send pad events. This patch adds the flag to resolve these issues.
