tracing: Rename ftrace_print_*() functions ta trace_print_*()

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The functions ftrace_print_*() are not part of
the function infrastructure, and the names can be confusing. Rename them
to be trace_print_*().
