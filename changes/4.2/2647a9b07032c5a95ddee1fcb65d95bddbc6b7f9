ipv6: Remove external dependency on rt6i_gateway and RTF_ANYCAST

When creating a RTF_CACHE route, RTF_ANYCAST is set based on rt6i_dst.
Also, rt6i_gateway is always set to the nexthop while the nexthop
could be a gateway or the rt6i_dst.addr.

After removing the rt6i_dst and rt6i_src dependency in the last patch,
we also need to stop the caller from depending on rt6i_gateway and
RTF_ANYCAST.
