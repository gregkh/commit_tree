net/tipc: initialize security state for new connection socket

Calling connect() with an AF_TIPC socket would trigger a series
of error messages from SELinux along the lines of:
SELinux: Invalid class 0
type=AVC msg=audit(1434126658.487:34500): avc:  denied  { <unprintable> }
  for pid=292 comm="kworker/u16:5" scontext=system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0
  tcontext=system_u:object_r:unlabeled_t:s0 tclass=<unprintable>
  permissive=0

This was due to a failure to initialize the security state of the new
connection sock by the tipc code, leaving it with junk in the security
class field and an unlabeled secid.  Add a call to security_sk_clone()
to inherit the security state from the parent socket.
