writeback: add {CONFIG|BDI_CAP|FS}_CGROUP_WRITEBACK

cgroup writeback requires support from both bdi and filesystem sides.
Add BDI_CAP_CGROUP_WRITEBACK and FS_CGROUP_WRITEBACK to indicate
support and enable BDI_CAP_CGROUP_WRITEBACK on block based bdi's by
default.  Also, define CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK which is enabled if
both MEMCG and BLK_CGROUP are enabled.

inode_cgwb_enabled() which determines whether a given inode's both bdi
and fs support cgroup writeback is added.
