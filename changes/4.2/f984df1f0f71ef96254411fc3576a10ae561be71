blk-mq: do limited block plug for multiple queue case

plug is still helpful for workload with IO merge, but it can be harmful
otherwise especially with multiple hardware queues, as there is
(supposed) no lock contention in this case and plug can introduce
latency. For multiple queues, we do limited plug, eg plug only if there
is request merge. If a request doesn't have merge with following
request, the requet will be dispatched immediately.

V2: check blk_queue_nomerges() as suggested by Jeff.
