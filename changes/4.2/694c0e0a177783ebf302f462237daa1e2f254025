ath: support new FCC DFS Radar Type 1

Add support for new FCC DFS rules released on August 14, 2014.
FCC has added a new radar type named Radar Type 1 and original
Radar Type 1 is renamed to Radar Type 0 in consequence.

During the certificate test, Type 1 PRI values are randomly selected
within the range of 518 and 3066 and we divide it to 3 groups based on
practical test result data collected for more than a year.

For about Radar type ID, it does nothing to functionalities.
In other words, even if we re-order the IDs, DFS detection will
work as well, but we give the ID with matching to FCC doc.

By adding this support, the drivers using this DFS function are
able to support both of old and new FCC DFS rules simultaneously
without any other changes.
