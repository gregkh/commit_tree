s390/mm: make hugepages_supported a boot time decision

There is a potential bug with KVM and hugetlbfs if the hardware does not
support hugepages (EDAT1).  We fix this by making EDAT1 a hard requirement
for hugepages and therefore removing and simplifying code.

As s390, with the sw-emulated hugepages, was the only user of
arch_prepare/release_hugepage I also removed theses calls from common and
other architecture code.

This patch (of 5):

By dropping support for hugepages on machines which do not have the
hardware feature EDAT1, we fix a potential s390 KVM bug.

The bug would happen if a guest is backed by hugetlbfs (not supported
currently), but does not get pagetables with PGSTE.  This would lead to
random memory overwrites.
