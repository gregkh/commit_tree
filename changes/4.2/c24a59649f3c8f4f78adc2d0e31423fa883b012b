ip_tunnel: Report Rx dropped in ip_tunnel_get_stats64

The rx_dropped stat wasn't being reported when ip_tunnel_get_stats64 was
called.  This was leading to some confusing results in my debug as I was
seeing rx_errors increment but no other value which pointed me toward the
type of error being seen.

This change corrects that by using netdev_stats_to_stats64 to copy all
available dev stats instead of just the few that were hand picked.
