mei: fix flow control for single buffer clients

For ME clients that use single receiving buffer
the driver tracks credentials on mei_me_clients structure
for all connections. The driver needs to book keep the shared
resource correctly and track the connections, particularly
the credit has to be cleaned when there is no active connection
to a particular me client. This solves issue when subsequent
connection will not get an ill impression that it can write.

We add active connection counter the particular ME client and
when the counter reach zero, we clear the credits.
