acpi-video-detect: Rewrite backlight interface selection logic

Currently we have 2 kernel commandline options + dmi-quirks in 3 places all
interacting (in interesting ways) to select which which backlight interface
to use. On the commandline we've acpi_backlight=[video|vendor] and
video.use_native_backlight=[0|1]. DMI quirks we have in
acpi/video-detect.c, acpi/video.c and drivers/platform/x86/*.c .

This commit is the first step to cleaning this up, replacing the 2 cmdline
options with just acpi_backlight=[video|vendor|native|none], and adds a
new API to video_detect.c to reflect this.

Follow up commits will also move other related code, like unregistering the
acpi_video backlight interface if it was registered before other drivers
which take priority over it are loaded, to video_detect.c where this
logic really belongs.
