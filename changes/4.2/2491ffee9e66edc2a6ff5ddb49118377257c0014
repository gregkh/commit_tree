mm/memory-failure: me_huge_page() does nothing for thp

memory_failure() is supposed not to handle thp itself, but to split it.
But if something were wrong and page_action() were called on thp,
me_huge_page() (action routine for hugepages) should be better to take
no action, rather than to take wrong action prepared for hugetlb (which
triggers BUG_ON().)

This change is for potential problems, but makes sense to me because thp
is an actively developing feature and this code path can be open in the
future.
