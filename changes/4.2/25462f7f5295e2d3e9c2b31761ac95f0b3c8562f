KVM: x86/vPMU: Define kvm_pmu_ops to support vPMU function dispatch

This patch defines a new function pointer struct (kvm_pmu_ops) to
support vPMU for both Intel and AMD. The functions pointers defined in
this new struct will be linked with Intel and AMD functions later. In the
meanwhile the struct that maps from event_sel bits to PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE
events is renamed and moved from Intel specific code to kvm_host.h as a
common struct.
