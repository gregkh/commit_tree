ring-buffer: Allways do the trace_recursive checks

Currently the trace_recursive checks are only done if CONFIG_TRACING
is enabled. That was because there use to be a dependency with tracing
for the recursive checks (it used the task_struct trace recursive
variable). But now it uses its own variable and there is no dependency.
