GFS2: Average in only non-zero round-trip times for congestion stats

This patch changes function gfs2_rgrp_congested so that it only factors
in non-zero values into its average round trip time. If the round-trip
time is zero for a particular cpu, that cpu has obviously never dealt
with bouncing the resource group in question, so factoring in a zero
value will only skew the numbers. It also fixes a compile error on
some arches related to division.
