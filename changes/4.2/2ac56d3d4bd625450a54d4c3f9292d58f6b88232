xfs: fix remote symlinks on V5/CRC filesystems

If we create a CRC filesystem, mount it, and create a symlink with
a path long enough that it can't live in the inode, we get a very
strange result upon remount:

# ls -l mnt
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 929 Jun 15 16:58 link -> XSLM

XSLM is the V5 symlink block header magic (which happens to be
followed by a NUL, so the string looks terminated).

xfs_readlink_bmap() advanced cur_chunk by the size of the header
for CRC filesystems, but never actually used that pointer; it
kept reading from bp->b_addr, which is the start of the block,
rather than the start of the symlink data after the header.

Looks like this problem goes back to v3.10.

Fixing this gets us reading the proper link target, again.
