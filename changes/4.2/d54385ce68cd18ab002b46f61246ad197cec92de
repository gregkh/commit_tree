etherdev: Process is_multicast_ether_addr at same size as other operations

This change makes it so that we process the address in
is_multicast_ether_addr at the same size as the other calls.  This allows
us to avoid duplicate reads when used with other calls such as
is_zero_ether_addr or eth_addr_copy.  In addition I have added a 64 bit
version of the function so in eth_type_trans we can process the destination
address as a 64 bit value throughout.
