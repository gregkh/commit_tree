be2net: enable IFACE filters only after creating RXQs

HW issues were observed on Lancer adapters if IFACE filters
(flags, mac addrs etc) are enabled *before* creating RXQs.  This patch
changes the driver design by enabling filters in be_open() --
instead of be_setup() -- after RXQs are created and buffers posted.
Two new wrapper functions, be_enable_if_filters() and
be_disable_if_filters() are introduced to enable/disable IFACE filters in
be_open()/be_close() respectively. In be_setup() the IFACE is now created
only with the RSS flag.
