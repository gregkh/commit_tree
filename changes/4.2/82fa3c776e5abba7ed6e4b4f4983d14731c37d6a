hv_netvsc: Use the xmit_more skb flag to optimize signaling the host

Based on the information given to this driver (via the xmit_more skb flag),
we can defer signaling the host if more packets are on the way. This will help
make the host more efficient since it can potentially process a larger batch of
packets. Implement this optimization.
