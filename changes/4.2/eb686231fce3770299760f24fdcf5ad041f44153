net: phy: fix phy link up when limiting speed via device tree

When limiting phy link speed using "max-speed" to 100mbps or less on a
giga bit phy, phy never completes auto negotiation and phy state
machine is held in PHY_AN. Fixing this issue by comparing the giga
bit advertise though phydev->supported doesn't have it but phy has
BMSR_ESTATEN set. So that auto negotiation is restarted as old and
new advertise are different and link comes up fine.
