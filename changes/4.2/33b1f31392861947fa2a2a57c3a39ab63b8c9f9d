net: ip_fragment: remove BRIDGE_NETFILTER mtu special handling

since commit d6b915e29f4adea9
("ip_fragment: don't forward defragmented DF packet") the largest
fragment size is available in the IPCB.

Therefore we no longer need to care about 'encapsulation'
overhead of stripped PPPOE/VLAN headers since ip_do_fragment
doesn't use device mtu in such cases.
