cpufreq: Remove cpufreq_update_policy()

cpufreq_update_policy() was kept as a separate routine earlier as it was
handling migration of sysfs directories, which isn't the case anymore.
It is only updating policy->cpu now and is called by a single caller.

The WARN_ON() isn't really required anymore, as we are just updating the
cpu now, not moving the sysfs directories.
