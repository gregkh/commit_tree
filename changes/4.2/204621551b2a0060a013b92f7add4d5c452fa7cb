net: inet_diag: export IPV6_V6ONLY sockopt

For AF_INET6 sockets, the value of struct ipv6_pinfo.ipv6only is
exported to userspace. It indicates whether a socket bound to in6addr_any
listens on IPv4 as well as IPv6. Since the socket is natively IPv6, it is not
listed by e.g. 'ss -l -4'.

This patch is accompanied by an appropriate one for iproute2 to enable
the additional information in 'ss -e'.
