locking/pvqspinlock: Rename QUEUED_SPINLOCK to QUEUED_SPINLOCKS

Valentin Rothberg reported that we use CONFIG_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS
in arch/x86/kernel/paravirt_patch_32.c, while the symbol is
called CONFIG_QUEUED_SPINLOCK. (Note the extra 'S')

But the typo was natural: the proper English term for such
a generic object would be 'queued spinlocks' - so rename
this and related symbols accordingly to the plural form.
