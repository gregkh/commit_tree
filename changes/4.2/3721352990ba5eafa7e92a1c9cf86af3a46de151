powerpc/eeh: fix start/end/flags type in struct pci_io_addr_range{}

struct pci_io_addr_range{} stores the information of pci resources. It
would be better to keep these related fields have the same type as in
struct resource{}.

This patch fixes the start/end/flags type in struct pci_io_addr_range{} to
have the same type as in struct resource{}.
