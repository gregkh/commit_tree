bnx2i: Fix call trace while device reset

The driver waits for command completion event while cleanup of task
within the frwd lock and back locks. The frwd lock was still held
which caused the call trace while issuing a device reset.
Release the frwd lock along with the back lock
to avoid waiting in the lock context.
