HID: usbhid: Add a quirk for raphnet multi-gamepad adapters

The raphnet.net 4nes4snes and 2nes2snes multi-joystick adapters use a single
HID report descriptor with one report ID per controller. This has the effect
that the inputs of otherwise independent game controllers get packed in one
large joystick device.

With this patch each controller gets its own /dev/input/jsX device, which is
more natural and less confusing than having all inputs going to the same place.
