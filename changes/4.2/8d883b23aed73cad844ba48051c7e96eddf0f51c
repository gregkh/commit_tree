arm64: alternative: Merge alternative-asm.h into alternative.h

asm/alternative-asm.h and asm/alternative.h are extremely similar,
and really deserve to live in the same file (as this makes further
modufications a bit easier).

Fold the content of alternative-asm.h into alternative.h, and
update the few users.
