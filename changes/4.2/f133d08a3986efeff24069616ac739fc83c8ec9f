Documentation: cpufreq: delete duplicate description of sysfs interface 'scaling_driver'

The file 'Documentation/cpu-freq/user-guide.txt' has duplicate
description of sysfs interface 'scaling_driver'.

[first]
scaling_driver :                this file shows what cpufreq driver is
				used to set the frequency on this CPU

[second]
scaling_driver :                Hardware driver for cpufreq.

Although this does not affect anything, I think we should only have
one. so delete the second one because the first one is described in
more detail.
