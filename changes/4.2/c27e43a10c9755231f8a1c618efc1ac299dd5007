ext4: minor cleanup of ext4_da_reserve_space()

Remove outdated comments and dead code from ext4_da_reserve_space.
Clean up its trace point, and relocate it to make it more useful.

While we're at it, fix a nearby conditional used to determine if
we have a non-bigalloc file system.  It doesn't match usage elsewhere
in the code, and misleadingly suggests that an s_cluster_ratio value
of 0 would be legal.
