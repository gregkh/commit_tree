drm/atomic: Allow drivers to subclass drm_atomic_state, v3

Drivers may need to store the state of shared resources, such as PLLs
or FIFO space, into the atomic state. Allow this by making it possible
to subclass drm_atomic_state.

Changes since v1:
- Change member names for functions to atomic_state_(alloc,clear)
- Change __drm_atomic_state_new to drm_atomic_state_init
- Allow free function to be overridden too, in case extra memory is
  allocated in alloc.
Changes since v2:
- Rename *_default_free to default_release, to make clear it doesn't
  free the state object itself.
