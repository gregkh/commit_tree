devpts: if initialization failed, don't crash when opening /dev/ptmx

If devpts failed to initialize, it would store an ERR_PTR in the global
devpts_mnt.  A subsequent open of /dev/ptmx would call devpts_new_index,
which would dereference devpts_mnt and crash.

Avoid storing invalid values in devpts_mnt; leave it NULL instead.  Make
both devpts_new_index and devpts_pty_new fail gracefully with ENODEV in
that case, which then becomes the return value to the userspace open call
on /dev/ptmx.
