[media] media: Fix regression in some more dib0700 based devices

Fix an oops during device initialization by correctly setting size_of_priv
instead of leaving it 0.
The regression was introduced by 8abe4a0a3f6d4217b16a ("[media] dib7000:
export just one symbol") and only fixed for one type of dib0700 based
devices in 9e334c75642b6e5bfb95 ("[media] Fix regression in some dib0700
based devices").
