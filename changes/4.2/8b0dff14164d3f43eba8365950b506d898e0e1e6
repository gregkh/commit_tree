lpfc: Add support for using block multi-queue

With blk-mq support in the mid-layer, lpfc can do IO steering based
on the information in the request tag.  This patch allows lpfc to use
blk-mq if enabled. If not enabled, we fall back into the emulex-internal
affinity mappings.

This feature can be turned on via CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT or passing
scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=Y as a parameter to the kernel.
