perf hists browser: Honour the help line provided by builtin-{top,report}.c

The hists_browser was replacing whatever helpline provided by 'top' or
'report' with a static "Press '?' for help on key bindings", fix it.

Now the message passed by top appears at the bottom of the screen:

"For a higher level overview, try: perf top --sort comm,dso"

As well the message that will be added when the user presses 'f' to
disable the events, something along the lines of "press f again to
re-enable...".
