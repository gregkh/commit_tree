tracing: Rename ftrace_raw_##call event structures to trace_event_raw_##call

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The ftrace_raw_##call structures are built
by macros for trace events. They have nothing to do with function tracing.
Rename them.
