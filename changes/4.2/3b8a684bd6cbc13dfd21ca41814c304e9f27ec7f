drm/atomic-helper: Add an atomice best_encoder callback

With legacy helpers all the routing was already set up when calling
best_encoder and so could be inspected. But with atomic it's staged,
hence we need a new atomic compliant callback for drivers which need
to inspect the requested state and can't just decided the best encoder
statically.

This is needed to fix up i915 dp mst where we need to pick the right
encoder depending upon the requested CRTC for the connector.

v2: Don't forget to amend the kerneldoc
