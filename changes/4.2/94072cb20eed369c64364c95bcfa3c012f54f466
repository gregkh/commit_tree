crypto: fips - Move fips_enabled sysctl into fips.c

There is currently a large ifdef FIPS code section in proc.c.
Ostensibly it's there because the fips_enabled sysctl sits under
/proc/sys/crypto.  However, no other crypto sysctls exist.

In fact, the whole ethos of the crypto API is against such user
interfaces so this patch moves all the FIPS sysctl code over to
fips.c.
