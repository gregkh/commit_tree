ASoC: fsl_sai: add sai master mode support

When sai works on master mode, set its bit clock and frame clock.

SAI has 4 MCLK source, bus clock, MCLK1, MCLK2 and MCLK3. fsl_sai_set_bclk
will select proper MCLK source, then calculate and set the bit clock divider.

After fsl_sai_set_bclk, enable the selected mclk in hw_params(), and add
hw_free() to disable the mclk.
