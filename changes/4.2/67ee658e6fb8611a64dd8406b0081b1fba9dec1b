x86/fpu: Rename fpu__unlazy_stopped() to fpu__activate_stopped()

In line with the fpstate_activate() change, name
fpu__unlazy_stopped() in a similar fashion as well: its purpose
is to make the fpstate of a stopped task the current and active FPU
context, which may require unlazying and initialization.

The unlazying is just part of the job, the main concept is to make
the fpstate active.

Also clarify the function's description to clarify its exact
usage and the background behind it all.
