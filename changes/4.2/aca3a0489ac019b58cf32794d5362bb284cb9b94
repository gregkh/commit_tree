xhci: do not report PLC when link is in internal resume state

Port link change with port in resume state should not be
reported to usbcore, as this is an internal state to be
handled by xhci driver. Reporting PLC to usbcore may
cause usbcore clearing PLC first and port change event irq
won't be generated.
