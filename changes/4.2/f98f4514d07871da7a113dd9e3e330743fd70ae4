packet: read num_members once in packet_rcv_fanout()

We need to tell compiler it must not read f->num_members multiple
times. Otherwise testing if num is not zero is flaky, and we could
attempt an invalid divide by 0 in fanout_demux_cpu()

Note bug was present in packet_rcv_fanout_hash() and
packet_rcv_fanout_lb() but final 3.1 had a simple location
after commit 95ec3eb417115fb ("packet: Add 'cpu' fanout policy.")

Fixes: dc99f600698dc ("packet: Add fanout support.")
