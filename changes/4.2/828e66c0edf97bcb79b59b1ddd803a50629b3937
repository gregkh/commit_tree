i2c: omap: fix bus recovery setup

At least on the AM335x, enabling OMAP_I2C_SYSTEST_ST_EN is not enough to
allow direct access to the SCL and SDA pins. In addition to ST_EN, we
need to set the TMODE to 0b11 (Loop back & SDA/SCL IO mode select).
Also, as the reset values of SCL_O and SDA_O are 0 (which means "drive
low level"), we need to set them to 1 (which means "high-impedance") to
avoid unwanted changes on the pins.

As a precaution, reset all these bits to their default values after
recovery is complete.
