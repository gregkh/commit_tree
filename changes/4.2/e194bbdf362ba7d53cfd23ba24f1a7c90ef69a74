kvm: x86: default legacy PCI device assignment support to "n"

VFIO has proved itself a much better option than KVM's built-in
device assignment.  It is mature, provides better isolation because
it enforces ACS, and even the userspace code is being tested on
a wider variety of hardware these days than the legacy support.

Disable legacy device assignment by default.
