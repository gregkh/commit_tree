f2fs: fix building on 32-bit architectures

A bug fix to the debug output extended the type of some local
variables to 64-bit, which now causes the kernel to fail building
because of missing 64-bit division functions:

ERROR: "__aeabi_uldivmod" [fs/f2fs/f2fs.ko] undefined!

In the kernel, we have to use div_u64 or do_div to do this,
in order to annotate that this is an expensive operation.

As the function is only called for debug out, we know this
is not performance critical, so it is safe to use div_u64.
