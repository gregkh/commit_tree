rcu: Directly drive RCU_USER_QS from Kconfig

Currently, Kconfig will ask the user whether RCU_USER_QS should be set.
This is silly because Kconfig already has all the information that it
needs to set this parameter.  This commit therefore directly drives
the value of RCU_USER_QS via NO_HZ_FULL's "select" statement.
