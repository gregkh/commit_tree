ACPICA: De-macroize calls to standard C library functions

ACPICA commit 3b1026e0bdd3c32eb6d5d313f3ba0b1fee7597b4
ACPICA commit 00f0dc83f5cfca53b27a3213ae0d7719b88c2d6b
ACPICA commit 47d22a738d0e19fd241ffe4e3e9d4e198e4afc69

Across all of ACPICA. Replace C library macros such as ACPI_STRLEN with the
standard names such as strlen. The original purpose for these macros is
long since obsolete.
Also cast various invocations as necessary. Bob Moore, Jung-uk Kim, Lv Zheng.
