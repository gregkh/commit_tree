bpf: introduce bpf_clone_redirect() helper

Allow eBPF programs attached to classifier/actions to call
bpf_clone_redirect(skb, ifindex, flags) helper which will
mirror or redirect the packet by dynamic ifindex selection
from within the program to a target device either at ingress
or at egress. Can be used for various scenarios, for example,
to load balance skbs into veths, split parts of the traffic
to local taps, etc.
