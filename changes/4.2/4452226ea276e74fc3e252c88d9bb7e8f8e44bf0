writeback: move backing_dev_info->state into bdi_writeback

Currently, a bdi (backing_dev_info) embeds single wb (bdi_writeback)
and the role of the separation is unclear.  For cgroup support for
writeback IOs, a bdi will be updated to host multiple wb's where each
wb serves writeback IOs of a different cgroup on the bdi.  To achieve
that, a wb should carry all states necessary for servicing writeback
IOs for a cgroup independently.

This patch moves bdi->state into wb.

* enum bdi_state is renamed to wb_state and the prefix of all enums is
  changed from BDI_ to WB_.

* Explicit zeroing of bdi->state is removed without adding zeoring of
  wb->state as the whole data structure is zeroed on init anyway.

* As there's still only one bdi_writeback per backing_dev_info, all
  uses of bdi->state are mechanically replaced with bdi->wb.state
  introducing no behavior changes.
