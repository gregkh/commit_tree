net: mvneta: fix refilling for Rx DMA buffers

With the actual code, if a memory allocation error happens while
refilling a Rx descriptor, then the original Rx buffer is both passed
to the networking stack (in a SKB) and let in the Rx ring. This leads
to various kernel oops and crashes.

As a fix, this patch moves Rx descriptor refilling ahead of building
SKB with the associated Rx buffer. In case of a memory allocation
failure, data is dropped and the original DMA buffer is put back into
the Rx ring.
