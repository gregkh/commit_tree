net/phy: micrel: Center FLP timing at 16ms

Link failures have been observed when using the KSZ9031 with HP 1810-8G
and HP 1910-8G network switches. Center the FLP timing at 16ms to help
avoid intermittent link failures.

>From the KSZ9031RNX and KSZ9031MNX data sheets revision 2.2, section
"Auto-Negotiation Timing":
	The KSZ9031[RNX or MNX] Fast Link Pulse (FLP) burst-to-burst
	transmit timing for Auto-Negotiation defaults to 8ms. IEEE 802.3
	Standard specifies this timing to be 16ms +/-8ms. Some PHY link
	partners need to receive the FLP with 16ms centered timing;
	otherwise, there can be intermittent link failures and long
	link-up times.

The PHY data sheet recommends configuring the FLP burst registers after
power-up/reset and immediately thereafter restarting auto-negotiation, so
we center the FLP timing at 16ms and then restart auto-negotiation in the
config_init for KSZ9031.
