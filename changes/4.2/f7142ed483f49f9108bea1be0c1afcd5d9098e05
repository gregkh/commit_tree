workqueue: simplify wq_update_unbound_numa()

wq_update_unbound_numa() is known be called with wq_pool_mutex held.

But wq_update_unbound_numa() requests wq->mutex before reading
wq->unbound_attrs, wq->numa_pwq_tbl[] and wq->dfl_pwq.  But these fields
were changed to be allowed being read with wq_pool_mutex held.  So we
simply remove the mutex_lock(&wq->mutex).

Without the dependence on the the mutex_lock(&wq->mutex), the test
of wq->unbound_attrs->no_numa can also be moved upward.

The old code need a long comment to describe the stableness of
@wq->unbound_attrs which is also guaranteed by wq_pool_mutex now,
so we don't need this such comment.
