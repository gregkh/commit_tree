x86/uapi: Do not export <asm/msr-index.h> as part of the user API headers

This header containing all MSRs and respective bit definitions
got exported to userspace in conjunction with the big UAPI
shuffle.

But, it doesn't belong in the UAPI headers because userspace can
do its own MSR defines and exporting them from the kernel blocks
us from doing cleanups/renames in that header. Which is
ridiculous - it is not kernel's job to export such a header and
keep MSRs list and their names stable.
