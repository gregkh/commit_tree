bonding: Implement user key part of port_key in an AD system.

The port key has three components - user-key, speed-part, and duplex-part.
The LSBit is for the duplex-part, next 5 bits are for the speed while the
remaining 10 bits are the user defined key bits. Get these 10 bits
from the user-space (through the SysFs interface) and use it to form the
admin port-key. Allowed range for the user-key is 0 - 1023 (10 bits). If
it is not provided then use zero for the user-key-bits (default).

It can set using following example code -

   # modprobe bonding mode=4
   # usr_port_key=$(( RANDOM & 0x3FF ))
   # echo $usr_port_key > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/ad_user_port_key
   # echo +eth1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
   ...
   # ip link set bond0 up
