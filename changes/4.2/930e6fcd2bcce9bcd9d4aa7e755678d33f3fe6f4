perf tools: Add time out to force stop proc map processing

System wide sampling like 'perf top' or 'perf record -a' read all
threads /proc/xxx/maps before sampling. If there are any threads which
generating a keeping growing huge maps, perf will do infinite loop
during synthesizing. Nothing will be sampled.

This patch fixes this issue by adding per-thread timeout to force stop
this kind of endless proc map processing.

PERF_RECORD_MISC_PROC_MAP_PARSE_TIME_OUT is introduced to indicate that
the mmap record are truncated by time out. User will get warning
notification when truncated mmap records are detected.
