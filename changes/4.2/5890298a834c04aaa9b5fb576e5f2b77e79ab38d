ARM: kvm: fix a bad BSYM() usage

BSYM() should only be used when refering to local symbols in the same
assembly file which are resolved by the assembler, and not for
linker-fixed up symbols.  The use of BSYM() with panic is incorrect as
the linker is involved in fixing up this relocation, and it knows
whether panic() is ARM or Thumb.
