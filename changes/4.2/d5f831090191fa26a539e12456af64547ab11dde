thermal: power_allocator: trace the real requested power

The power allocator governor uses ftrace to output a bunch of internal
data for debugging and tuning.  Currently, the requested power it
outputs is the "weighted" requested power, that is, what each cooling
device has requested multiplied by the cooling device weight.  It is
more useful to trace the real request, without any weight being
applied.

This commit only affects the data traced, there is no functional change.
