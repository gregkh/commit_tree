[media] rtl2832: add support for GoTView MasterHD 3 USB tuner

GoTView MasterHD 3 is a DVB-T2/C USB 2.0 tuner.

It's based on the following components:
- USB bridge: RTL2832P (contains also DVB-T demodulator)
- Demodulator: Si2168-A30
- Tuner: Si2148-A20

The demodulator and the tuner will need firmwares. The Si2148 uses Si2158
firmware. Antti has the firmwares available for download:

Do note that for DVB-T either of the demodulators can be used. DVB-C and
DVB-T2 are only supported by the Si2168 demodulator. The driver will
register 2 frontends for the same adapter. Frontend 0 will be the RTL2832
demodulator and frontend 1 will be the Si2168 demodulator. The same
tuner is used for both.

As a consequence of the above, it's recommended to use application that
does implement proper DVBv5 support.

For some reason, the old I2C write method sporadically fails. Thus the
need for an option to only use the new I2C write method supported by the
RTL2832.
