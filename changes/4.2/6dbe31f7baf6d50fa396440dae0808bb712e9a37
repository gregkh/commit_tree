perf probe: Remove all probes matches given pattern at once

Fix perf-probe --del option to delete all matched probes in both
of kprobes and uprobes at once.

When we have 2 or more events on different binaries as below,

  ----
  # ./perf probe -l
  probe:vfs_read       (on vfs_read@ksrc/linux-3/fs/read_write.c)
  probe_libc:malloc    (on __libc_malloc@malloc/malloc.c in /usr/lib64/libc-2.17
  ----

Trying to remove all event with '*' just removes kprobe events at first.
  ----
  # ./perf probe -d \*
  Removed event: probe:vfs_read
  ----

And in 2nd try, it removes all uprobe events.
  ----
  # ./perf probe -d \*
  Removed event: probe_libc:malloc
  ----

This fixes to remove all event at once as below.
  ----
  # ./perf probe -d \*
  Removed event: probe:vfs_read
  Removed event: probe_libc:malloc
