link_path_walk: nd->depth massage, part 1

nd->stack[0] is unused until the handling of trailing symlinks and
we want to get rid of that.  Having fucked that transformation up
several times, I went for bloody pedantic series of provably equivalent
transformations.  Sorry.

Step 1: keep nd->depth higher by one in link_path_walk() - increment upon
entry, decrement on exits, adjust the arithmetics inside and surround the
calls of functions that care about nd->depth value (nd_alloc_stack(),
get_link(), put_link()) with decrement/increment pairs.
