firmware: check for file truncation on direct firmware loading

When direct firmware loading is used we iterate over a list
of possible firmware paths and concatenate the desired firmware
name with each path and look for the file there. Should the
passed firmware name be too long we end up truncating the
file we want to look for, the search however is still done.
Add a check for truncation instead of looking for a
truncated firmware filename.
