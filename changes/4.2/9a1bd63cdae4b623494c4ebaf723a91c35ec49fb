livepatch: add module locking around kallsyms calls

The list of loaded modules is walked through in
module_kallsyms_on_each_symbol (called by kallsyms_on_each_symbol). The
module_mutex lock should be acquired to prevent potential corruptions
in the list.

This was uncovered with new lockdep asserts in module code introduced by
the commit 0be964be0d45 ("module: Sanitize RCU usage and locking") in
recent next- trees.
