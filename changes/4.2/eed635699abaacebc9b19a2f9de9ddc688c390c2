net: bcmgenet: Avoid sleeping in bcmgenet_timeout

bcmgenet_timeout() executes in atomic context, yet we will invoke
napi_disable() which does sleep. Looking back at the changes, disabling
TX napi and re-enabling it is completely useless, since we reclaim all
TX buffers and re-enable interrupts, and wake up the TX queues.
