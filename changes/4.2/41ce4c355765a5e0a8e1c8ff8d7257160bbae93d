hpsa: add masked physical devices into h->dev[] array

Cache the ioaccel handle so that when we need to abort commands sent
down the ioaccel2 path, we can look up the LUN ID in h->dev[] instead of
having to do I/O to the controller.

Add a field to elements in h->dev[] to keep track of how the device is exposed
to the SCSI mid layer: Not at all, without an upper level driver
(no_uld_attach) or normally exposed.

Since masked physical devices are now present in h->dev[] array
it would be perfectly possible to do

	echo scsi add-single-device 2 2 0 0 > /proc/scsi/scsi

and bring them online.  This was previously not allowed for masked
physical devices.

Ensure that the mapping of physical disks to logical drives gets updated in a
consistent way when a RAID migration occurs and is not touched until updates
to it are complete.

now instead of doing CISS_REPORT_PHYSICAL to get the LUNID for
the physical disk in hpsa_get_pdisk_of_ioaccel2(), just get
it out of h->dev[] where we already have it cached.

do not touch phys_disk[] for ioaccel enabled logical drives during rescan
