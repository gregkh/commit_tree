scatterlist: introduce sg_nents_for_len

When performing a dma_map_sg() call, the number of sg entries to map is
required. Using sg_nents to retrieve the number of sg entries will
return the total number of entries in the sg list up to the entry marked
as the end. If there happen to be unused entries in the list, these will
still be counted. Some dma_map_sg() implementations will not handle the
unused entries correctly (lib/swiotlb.c) and execute a BUG_ON.

The sg_nents_for_len() function will traverse the sg list and return the
number of entries required to satisfy the supplied length argument. This
can then be supplied to the dma_map_sg() call to successfully map the
sg.
