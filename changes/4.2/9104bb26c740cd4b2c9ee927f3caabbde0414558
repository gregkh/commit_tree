cpufreq: Don't traverse all active policies to find policy for a cpu

We reach here while adding policy for a CPU and enter into the 'if'
block only if a policy already exists for the CPU.

As cpufreq_cpu_data is set for all policy->related_cpus now, when the
policy is first added, we can use that to find the CPU's policy instead
of traversing the list of all active policies.
