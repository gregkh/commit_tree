drm/msm: restart queued submits after hang

Track the list of in-flight submits.  If the gpu hangs, retire up to an
including the offending submit, and then re-submit the remainder.  This
way, for concurrently running piglit tests (for example), one failing
test doesn't cause unrelated tests to fail simply because it's submit
was queued up after one that triggered a hang.
