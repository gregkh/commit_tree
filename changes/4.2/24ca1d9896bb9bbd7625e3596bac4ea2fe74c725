MIPS: dump_tlb: Take XPA into account

XPA extends the physical addresses on MIPS32, including the EntryLo
registers. Update dump_tlb() to concatenate the PFNX field from the high
end of the EntryLo registers (as read by mfhc0).

The width of physical and virtual addresses are also separated to show
only 8 nibbles of virtual but 11 nibbles of physical with XPA.
