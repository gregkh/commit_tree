net/unix: support SCM_SECURITY for stream sockets

SCM_SECURITY was originally only implemented for datagram sockets,
not for stream sockets.  However, SCM_CREDENTIALS is supported on
Unix stream sockets.  For consistency, implement Unix stream support
for SCM_SECURITY as well.  Also clean up the existing code and get
rid of the superfluous UNIXSID macro.

Motivated by https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1224211,
where systemd was using SCM_CREDENTIALS and assumed wrongly that
SCM_SECURITY was also supported on Unix stream sockets.
