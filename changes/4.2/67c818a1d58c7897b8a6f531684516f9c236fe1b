i40evf: fix panic during MTU change

Down was requesting queue disables, but then exited immediately
without waiting for the queues to actually disable.  This could
allow any function called after i40evf_down to run immediately,
including i40evf_up, and causes a memory leak.

Removing the whole reinit_locked function is the best way
to go about this, and allows for the driver to handle the
state changes by requesting reset from the periodic timer.

Also, add a couple WARN_ONs in slow path to help us recognize
if we re-introduce this issue or missed any cases.
