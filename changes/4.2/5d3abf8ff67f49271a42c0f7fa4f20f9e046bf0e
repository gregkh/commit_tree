libata: Fall back to unqueued READ LOG EXT if the DMA variant fails

Some devices advertise support for the READ/WRITE LOG DMA EXT commands
but fail when we try to issue them. This can lead to queued TRIM being
unintentionally disabled since the relevant feature flag is located in a
general purpose log page.

Fall back to unqueued READ LOG EXT if the DMA variant fails while
reading a log page.
