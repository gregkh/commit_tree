xfs: saner xfs_trans_commit interface

The flags argument to xfs_trans_commit is not useful for most callers, as
a commit of a transaction without a permanent log reservation must pass
0 here, and all callers for a transaction with a permanent log reservation
except for xfs_trans_roll must pass XFS_TRANS_RELEASE_LOG_RES.  So remove
the flags argument from the public xfs_trans_commit interfaces, and
introduce low-level __xfs_trans_commit variant just for xfs_trans_roll
that regrants a log reservation instead of releasing it.
