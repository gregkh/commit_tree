ARCv2: spinlock/rwlock: Reset retry delay when starting a new spin-wait cycle

The previous commit for delayed retry of SCOND needs some fine tuning
for spin locks.

The backoff from delayed retry in conjunction with spin looping of lock
itself can potentially cause the delay counter to reach high values.
So to provide fairness to any lock operation, after a lock "seems"
available (i.e. just before first SCOND try0, reset the delay counter
back to starting value of 1

Essentially reset delay to 1 for a new spin-wait-loop-acquire cycle.
