[media] saa7164: use an MSI interrupt when available

Enhances driver to use an MSI interrupt when available.

Adds the module option 'enable_msi' (type bool) which by default is
enabled. Can be set to 'N' to disable.

Fixes (or can reduce the occurrence of) a crash which is most commonly
reported when both digital tuners of the saa7164 chip is in use. A
reported example can be found here:
