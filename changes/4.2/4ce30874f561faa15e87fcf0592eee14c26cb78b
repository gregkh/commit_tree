iscsi: Fix iscsi endpoints leak

When creating a new endpoint, we look for a free id
for the new endpoint. We baisically loop on possible ids
and use the first id that class_find_device() returns NULL.
However, we are missing a reference put when class_find_device()
does find an existing device for a given id.
