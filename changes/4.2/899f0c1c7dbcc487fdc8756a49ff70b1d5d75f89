serial: 8250_pci: Correct uartclk for xr17v35x expansion chips

The internal clock of the master chip, which is usually 125MHz, is only half
(62.5MHz) for the slave chips. So we have to adjust the uartclk for all the
slave ports. Therefor we add a new function to determine if a slave chip is
present and update pci_xr17v35x_setup accordingly.
