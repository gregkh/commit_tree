ASoC: Intel: fix broadwell module removing failed issue

In haswell-pcm module unloading, we can't free runtime modules
directly, for they may be already freed in runtime suspend.

Here add executing suspend call to unload runtime modules, only
for status not equal to RPM_SUSPEND, to fix broadwell module
removing failed issue.
