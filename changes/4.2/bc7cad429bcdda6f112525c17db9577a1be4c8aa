perf hists browser: Split popup menu actions

Currently perf_evsel__hists_browse() function spins on a huge loop and
handles many key actions.  Since it's hard to read and modify, let's
split it out into small helper functions.

This patch introduces do_XXX() functions which corresponds to each goto
label.  This way we can call such functions both from key press actions
and popup menu actions.

No functional change intended.
