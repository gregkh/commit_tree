Disable write buffering on Toshiba ToPIC95

Disable write buffering on the Toshiba ToPIC95 if it is enabled by
somebody (it is not supposed to be a power-on default according to
the datasheet). On the ToPIC95, practically no 32-bit Cardbus card
will work under heavy load without locking up the whole system if
this is left enabled. I tried about a dozen. It does not affect
16-bit cards. This is similar to the O2 bugs in early controller
revisions it seems.
