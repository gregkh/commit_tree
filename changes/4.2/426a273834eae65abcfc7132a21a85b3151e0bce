iommu: Limit iommu_attach/detach_device to devices with their own group

This patch changes the behavior of the iommu_attach_device
and iommu_detach_device functions. With this change these
functions only work on devices that have their own group.
For all other devices the iommu_group_attach/detach
functions must be used.
