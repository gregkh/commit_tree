cfg80211: Allow GO concurrent relaxation after BSS disconnection

If a P2P GO was allowed on a channel because of the GO concurrent
relaxation, i.e., another station interface was associated to an AP on
the same channel or the same UNII band, and the station interface
disconnected from the AP, allow the following use cases unless the
channel is marked as indoor only and the device is not operating in an
indoor environment:

1. Allow the P2P GO to stay on its current channel. The rationale behind
   this is that if the channel or UNII band were allowed by the AP they
   could still be used to continue the P2P GO operation, and avoid connection
   breakage.
2. Allow another P2P GO to start on the same channel or another channel
   that is in the same UNII band as the previous instantiated P2P GO.
