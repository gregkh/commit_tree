KVM: provide irq_unsafe kvm_guest_{enter|exit}

Several kvm architectures disable interrupts before kvm_guest_enter.
kvm_guest_enter then uses local_irq_save/restore to disable interrupts
again or for the first time. Lets provide underscore versions of
kvm_guest_{enter|exit} that assume being called locked.
kvm_guest_enter now disables interrupts for the full function and
thus we can remove the check for preemptible.

This patch then adopts s390/kvm to use local_irq_disable/enable calls
which are slighty cheaper that local_irq_save/restore and call these
new functions.
