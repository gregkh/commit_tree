tools:iio:iio_utils: implement digit calculation

Previously, the return value of sscanf() was treated as an indication of
the digits it would have read. Yet, sscanf() only returns the amount of
valid matches.
Therefore, introduce a function to calculate the decimal digits of the
read number and use this one to commence a colon search, as originally
intended.
