mtd: nand: pxa3xx: fix build on ARM64

In preparation to enable ARCH_MMP on ARM64, a couple of fixes are needed
to build the pxa3xx_nand driver:

Legacy DMA will only used on ARM, so also make it condtional on
CONFIG_ARM.
__raw_{read,write}sl are not available on ARM64 or generically, so use
the readsl/writesl variants instead. Somewhat inconsistently,
{read,write}sl are inherently non-swapping with the generic version
using __raw_{read,write}l.
