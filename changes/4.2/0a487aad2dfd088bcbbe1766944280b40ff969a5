perf/x86/intel/pt: Kill pt_is_running()

Initially, we were trying to guard against scenarios where somebody
attaches to the system with a hardware debugger while PT is enabled
from software and pt_is_running() tries to make sure we handle this
better, but the truth is, there is still a race window no matter what
and people with hardware debuggers should really know what they are
doing anyway.

In other words, there is no point in keeping this one around, and
it's one RDMSR instructions fewer in the fast path.

The case when PT is enabled by the BIOS at boot time is handled
in the driver initialization path and doesn't use pt_is_running().

This patch gets rid of it.
