ACPICA: Tables: Fix an issue that FACS initialization is performed twice

ACPICA commit 90f5332a15e9d9ba83831ca700b2b9f708274658

This patch adds a new FACS initialization flag for acpi_tb_initialize().
acpi_enable_subsystem() might be invoked several times in OS bootup process,
and we don't want FACS initialization to be invoked twice. Lv Zheng.
