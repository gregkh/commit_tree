dts: imx25: fix sd card gpio polarity specified in device tree

cd-gpios polarity should be changed to GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW and wp-gpios
should be changed to GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH.
Otherwise, the SD may not work properly due to wrong polarity inversion
specified in DT after switch to common parsing function mmc_of_parse().
