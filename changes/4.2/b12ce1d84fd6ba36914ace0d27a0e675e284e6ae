    drm/i915: Remove implicitly disabling primary plane for now

but the intel_flush_primary_plane() calls were left behind. Replace them
with straight forward POSTING_READ() of the sprite surface address
register.

The other user of intel_flush_primary_plane() is g4x_disable_trickle_feed()
where we can just inline the steps directly.

This allows intel_flush_primary_plane() to be killed off.
