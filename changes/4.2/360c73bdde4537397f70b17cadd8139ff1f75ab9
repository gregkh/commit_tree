hpsa: factor out hpsa_init_cmd function

Factor out hpsa_cmd_init from cmd_alloc().  We also need
this for resubmitting commands down the default RAID path
when they have returned from the ioaccel paths with errors.

In particular, reinitialize the cmd_type and busaddr fields as these
will not be correct for submitting down the RAID stack path
after ioaccel command completion.

This saves time when submitting commands.
