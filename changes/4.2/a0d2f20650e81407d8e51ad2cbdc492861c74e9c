Renesas Ethernet AVB PTP clock driver

Ethernet AVB device includes the gPTP  timer, so we can implement a PTP clock
driver.  We're doing that in a separate file, with  the main Ethernet driver
calling the PTP driver's [de]initialization and interrupt handler functions.
Unfortunately, the clock seems tightly coupled with the AVB-DMAC, so when that
one leaves the operation mode, we have to unregister the PTP clock... :-(
