iwlwifi: mvm: don't increase max_out_time when low priority scan is requested

In some cases, max_out_time value is smaller than 200 and having the
NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_LOW_PRIORITY flag was actually causing the
max_out_time to be increased.  To avoid that, set max_out_time to 200
only if it's greater than 200.
