ARM: vfp: Add vfp_disable for problematic platforms

Some platforms might not be able to fully utilize VFP when e.g: one CPU
out of two in a SMP complex lacks a VFP unit. Adding code to migrate
task to the CPU which has a VFP unit would be cumbersome and not
performant, instead, just add the ability to disable VFP.
