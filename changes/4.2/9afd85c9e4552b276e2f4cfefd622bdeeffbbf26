net: Export IGMP/MLD message validation code

With this patch, the IGMP and MLD message validation functions are moved
from the bridge code to IPv4/IPv6 multicast files. Some small
refactoring was done to enhance readibility and to iron out some
differences in behaviour between the IGMP and MLD parsing code (e.g. the
skb-cloning of MLD messages is now only done if necessary, just like the
IGMP part always did).

Finally, these IGMP and MLD message validation functions are exported so
that not only the bridge can use it but batman-adv later, too.
