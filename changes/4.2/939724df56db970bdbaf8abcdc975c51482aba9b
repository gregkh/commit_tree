link_path_walk: nd->depth massage, part 10

Get rid of orig_depth checks in OK: logics.  If nd->depth is
zero, we had been called from path_init() and we are done.
If it is greater than 1, we are not done, whether we'd been
called from path_init() or trailing_symlink().  And in
case when it's 1, we might have been called from path_init()
and reached the end of nested symlink (in which case
nd->stack[0].name will point to the rest of pathname and
we are not done) or from trailing_symlink(), in which case
we are done.

Just have trailing_symlink() leave NULL in nd->stack[0].name
and use that to discriminate between those cases.
