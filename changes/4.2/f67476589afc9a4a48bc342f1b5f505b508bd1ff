[media] v4l2-dv-timings: fix rounding error in vsync_bp calculation

Changed the rounding offsets used in vsync_bp calculation in cvt and
gtf timings. The results for vsync_bp should now match with results
from timing generator spreadsheets for cvt and gtf standards.

In the vsync_bp calculation for cvt, always round down the value of
(CVT_MIN_VSYNC_BP / h_period_est) and then add 1. It thus, reflects
the equation used in timing generator spreadsheet. Using 1999999 as
rounding offset, could pontentially lead to bumping up the vsync_bp
value by extra 1.

In the vsync_bp calculations for gtf, instead of round up or round
down, round the (CVT_MIN_VSYNC_BP / h_period_est) to the nearest
integer.

standards and suggestions on equations.
