nfsd: do nfs4_check_fh in nfs4_check_file instead of nfs4_check_olstateid

Currently, preprocess_stateid_op calls nfs4_check_olstateid which
verifies that the open stateid corresponds to the current filehandle in the
call by calling nfs4_check_fh.

If the stateid is a NFS4_DELEG_STID however, then no such check is done.
This could cause incorrect enforcement of permissions, because the
nfsd_permission() call in nfs4_check_file uses current the current
filehandle, but any subsequent IO operation will use the file descriptor
in the stateid.

Move the call to nfs4_check_fh into nfs4_check_file instead so that it
can be done for all stateid types.
