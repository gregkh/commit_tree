switchdev: convert parent_id_get to switchdev attr get

Switch ID is just a gettable port attribute.  Convert switchdev op
switchdev_parent_id_get to a switchdev attr.

Note: for sysfs and netlink interfaces, SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_PARENT_ID is
called with SWITCHDEV_F_NO_RECUSE to limit switch ID user-visiblity to only
port netdevs.  So when a port is stacked under bond/bridge, the user can
only query switch id via the switch ports, but not via the upper devices
