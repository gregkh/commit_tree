net: Get rid of IPv6 hash addresses flow keys

We don't need to return the IPv6 address hash as part of flow keys.
In general, using the IPv6 address hash is risky in a hash value
since the underlying use of xor provides no entropy. If someone
really needs the hash value they can get it from the full IPv6
addresses in flow keys (e.g. from flow_get_u32_src).
