cpufreq: Keep a single path for adding managed CPUs

There are two cases when we may try to add CPUs we're already handling:
 - On boot, the first cpu has marked all policy->cpus managed and so we
   will find policy for all other policy->cpus later on.
 - When a managed cpu is hotplugged out and later brought back in.

Currently, separate paths and checks take care of the two.  While the
first one is detected by testing cpu against 'policy->cpus', the other
one is detected by testing cpu against 'policy->related_cpus'.

We can handle them both via a single path and there is no need to do
special checking for the first one.
