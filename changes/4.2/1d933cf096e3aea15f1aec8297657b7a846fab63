blkcg: implement bio_associate_blkcg()

Currently, a bio can only be associated with the io_context and blkcg
of %current using bio_associate_current().  This is too restrictive
for cgroup writeback support.  Implement bio_associate_blkcg() which
associates a bio with the specified blkcg.

bio_associate_blkcg() leaves the io_context unassociated.
bio_associate_current() is updated so that it considers a bio as
already associated if it has a blkcg_css, instead of an io_context,
associated with it.
