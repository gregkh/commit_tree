ethtool: Add helper routines to pass vf to rx_flow_spec

The ring_cookie is 64 bits wide which is much larger than can be used
for actual queue index values. So provide some helper routines to
pack a VF index into the cookie. This is useful to steer packets to
a VF ring without having to know the queue layout of the device.
