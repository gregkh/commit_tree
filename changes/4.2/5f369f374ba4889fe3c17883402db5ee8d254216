mm: kmemleak: do not acquire scan_mutex in kmemleak_do_cleanup()

The kmemleak_do_cleanup() work thread already waits for the kmemleak_scan
thread to finish via kthread_stop().  Waiting in kthread_stop() while
scan_mutex is held may lead to deadlock if kmemleak_scan_thread() also
waits to acquire for scan_mutex.
