thermal/cpu_cooling: update policy limits if clipped_freq < policy->max

policy->max is the maximum allowed frequency defined by user and
clipped_freq is the maximum that thermal constraints allow.

If clipped_freq is lower than policy->max, then we need to readjust
policy->max.

But, if clipped_freq is greater than policy->max, we don't need to do
anything. We used to call cpufreq_verify_within_limits() in this case,
but it doesn't change anything in this case.

Lets skip this unnecessary call and write a comment that explains this.
