i40evf: skb->xmit_more support

Eric added support for skb->xmit_more in i40e, this ports that into
i40evf as well.

Support skb->xmit_more in i40evf is straightforward; we need to move
around i40e_maybe_stop_tx() call to correctly test netif_xmit_stopped()
before taking the decision to not kick the NIC.
