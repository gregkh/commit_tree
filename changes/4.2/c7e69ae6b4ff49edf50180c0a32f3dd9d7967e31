ALSA: hda: fix possible NULL dereference

After a for-loop was replaced by list_for_each_entry, see
Commit bbbc7e8502c9 ("ALSA: hda - Allocate hda_pcm objects dynamically"),
Commit 751e2216899c ("ALSA: hda: fix possible null dereference"),
a possible NULL pointer dereference has been introduced; this patch adds
the NULL check on pcm->pcm, while leaving a potentially superfluous
check on pcm itself untouched.
