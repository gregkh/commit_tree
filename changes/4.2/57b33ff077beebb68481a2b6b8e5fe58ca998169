mfd: cros_ec: Support multiple EC in a system

Chromebooks can have more than one Embedded Controller so the
cros_ec device id has to be incremented for each EC registered.

Add a new structure to represent multiple EC as different char
devices (e.g: /dev/cros_ec, /dev/cros_pd). It connects to
cros_ec_device and allows sysfs inferface for cros_pd.

Also reduce number of allocated objects, make chromeos sysfs
class object a static and add refcounting to prevent object
deletion while command is in progress.
