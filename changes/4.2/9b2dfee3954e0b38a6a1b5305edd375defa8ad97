regulator: qcom_spmi: Add missing braces for aligned code

drivers/regulator/qcom_spmi-regulator.c:751:3-50: code aligned
with following code on line 753
drivers/regulator/qcom_spmi-regulator.c:584:3-41: code aligned
with following code on line 587

These lines where missing braces causing the break to always
be executed even when it shouldn't be. Fix it.
