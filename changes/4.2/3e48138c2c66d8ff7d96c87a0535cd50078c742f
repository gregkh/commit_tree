HID: i2c-hid: Do not set the ACPI companion field in the HID device

The HID device does not need to know about the ACPI device associated with
the underlying i2c device. Setting the ACPI companion field in the HID device
also has the side effect of causing HID to be set as wake capable, since
acpi_bind_one uses's the companion ACPI device's wakeup flags to set the
device as wake capable. Which results in power/wakeup files in sysfs for
the HID device which do not do anything.
