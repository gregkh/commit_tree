MIPS: dump_tlb: Take global bit into account

The TLB only matches the ASID when the global bit isn't set, so
dump_tlb() shouldn't really be skipping global entries just because the
ASID doesn't match. Fix the condition to read the TLB entry's global bit
from EntryLo0. Note that after a TLB read the global bits in both
EntryLo registers reflect the same global bit in the TLB entry.
