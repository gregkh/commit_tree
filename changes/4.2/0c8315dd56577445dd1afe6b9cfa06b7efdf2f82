nfs: always update creds in mirror, even when we have an already connected ds

A ds can be associated with more than one mirror, but we currently skip
setting a mirror's credentials if we find that it's already set up with
a connected client.

The upshot is that we can end up sending DS writes with MDS credentials
instead of properly setting them up. Fix nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds to
always verify that the mirror's credentials are set up, even when we
have a DS that's already connected.
