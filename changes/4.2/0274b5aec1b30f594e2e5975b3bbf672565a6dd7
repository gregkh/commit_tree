staging: unisys: Convert pending_msg_hdr to a pointer

In order for bus/dev_info structs to become public structs, one
element, pending_msg_hdr, needs to become opaque.  This is to keep
all the internals of the controlvm struct private to the bus layer.

So a simple conversion of embedding the pending_msg_hdr struct into
a pointer is done.  The rest of the patch is the fallout.

The rules are modified slightly.  Instead of relying on the 'id' to be
CONTROLVM_INVALID to indicate invalid, just use the pointer set to NULL.

In addition, because bus/dev_info can be NULL and we still need to send
a
response, pass pending_msg_hdr to all 'responders' instead of bus/

That change causes some fallout in the success case.  Instead of setting
state
bits and clearing info in the responders, do all that magic in the
responder
wrappers.
