net: fix two sparse errors

First one in __skb_checksum_validate_complete() fixes the following
(and other callers)

make C=2 CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.o
  CHECK   net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c
include/linux/skbuff.h:3052:24: warning: incorrect type in return expression (different base types)
include/linux/skbuff.h:3052:24:    expected restricted __sum16
include/linux/skbuff.h:3052:24:    got int

Second is fixing gso_make_checksum() :

  CHECK   net/ipv4/gre_offload.c
include/linux/skbuff.h:3360:14: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
include/linux/skbuff.h:3360:14:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] csum
include/linux/skbuff.h:3360:14:    got restricted __sum16
include/linux/skbuff.h:3365:16: warning: incorrect type in return expression (different base types)
include/linux/skbuff.h:3365:16:    expected restricted __sum16
include/linux/skbuff.h:3365:16:    got unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] csum

Fixes: 5a21232983aa7 ("net: Support for csum_bad in skbuff")
Fixes: 7e2b10c1e52ca ("net: Support for multiple checksums with gso")
