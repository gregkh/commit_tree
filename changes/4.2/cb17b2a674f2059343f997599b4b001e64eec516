x86/hpet: Use proper hpet device number for MSI allocation

hpet_assign_irq() is called with hpet_device->num as "hardware
interrupt number", but hpet_device->num is initialized after the
interrupt has been assigned, so it's always 0. As a consequence only
the first MSI allocation succeeds, the following ones fail because the
"hardware interrupt number" already exists.

Move the initialization of dev->num and other fields before the call
to hpet_assign_irq(), which is the ordering before the offending
commit which introduced that regression.
