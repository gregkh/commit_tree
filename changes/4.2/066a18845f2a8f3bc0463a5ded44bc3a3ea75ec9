xfs: use sparse chunk alignment for min. inode allocation requirement

xfs_ialloc_ag_select() iterates through the allocation groups looking
for free inodes or free space to determine whether to allow an inode
allocation to proceed. If no free inodes are available, it assumes that
an AG must have an extent longer than mp->m_ialloc_blks.

Sparse inode chunk support currently allows for allocations smaller than
the traditional inode chunk size specified in m_ialloc_blks. The current
minimum sparse allocation is set in the superblock sb_spino_align field
at mkfs time. Create a new m_ialloc_min_blks field in xfs_mount and use
this to represent the minimum supported allocation size for inode
chunks. Initialize m_ialloc_min_blks at mount time based on whether
sparse inodes are supported.
