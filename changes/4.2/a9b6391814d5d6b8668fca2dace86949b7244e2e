packet: rollover statistics

Rollover indicates exceptional conditions. Export a counter to inform
socket owners of this state.

If no socket with sufficient room is found, rollover fails. Also count
these events.

Finally, also count when flows are rolled over early thanks to huge
flow detection, to validate its correctness.

Tested:
  Read counters in bench_rollover on all other tests in the patchset
