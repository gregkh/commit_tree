nfsd: work around a gcc-5.1 warning

gcc-5.0 warns about a potential uninitialized variable use in nfsd:

fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c: In function 'nfsd4_process_open2':
fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:3781:3: warning: 'old_deny_bmap' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   reset_union_bmap_deny(old_deny_bmap, stp);
   ^
fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:3760:16: note: 'old_deny_bmap' was declared here
  unsigned char old_deny_bmap;
                ^

This is a false positive, the code path that is warned about cannot
actually be reached.

This adds an initialization for the variable to make the warning go
away.
