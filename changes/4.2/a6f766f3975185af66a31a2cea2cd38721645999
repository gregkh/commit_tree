drm/i915: Limit ring synchronisation (sw sempahores) RPS boosts

Ring switches can occur many times per frame, and are often out of
control, causing frequent RPS boosting for no practical benefit. Treat
the sw semaphore synchronisation as a separate client and only allow it
to boost once per busy/idle cycle.
