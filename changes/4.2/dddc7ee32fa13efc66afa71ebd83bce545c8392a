perf probe: Fix an error when deleting probes successfully

Fix a bug in del_perf_probe_events() which returns an error (-ENOENT)
even if the probes are successfully deleted.

This happens only if the probes are on user-apps and not on kernel,
simply because it doesn't clear the previous error.

So, without this fix, we get an error even though events are being
successfully removed.

  ------
  # ./perf probe -x ./perf del_perf_probe_events
  Added new event:
    probe_perf:del_perf_probe_events (on del_perf_probe_events in ...

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

          perf record -e probe_perf:del_perf_probe_events -aR sleep 1

  # ./perf probe -d \*:\*
  Removed event: probe_perf:del_perf_probe_events
    Error: Failed to delete events.
  ------

This fixes the above error.
  ------
  # ./perf probe -d \*:\*
  Removed event: probe_perf:del_perf_probe_events
  ------
