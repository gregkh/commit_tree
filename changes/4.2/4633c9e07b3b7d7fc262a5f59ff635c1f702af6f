net-packet: fix null pointer exception in rollover mode

Rollover can be enabled as flag or mode. Allocate state in both cases.
This solves a NULL pointer exception in fanout_demux_rollover on
referencing po->rollover if using mode rollover.

Also make sure that in rollover mode each silo is tried (contrary
to rollover flag, where the main socket is excluded after an initial
try_self).

Tested:
  Passes tools/testing/net/psock_fanout.c, which tests both modes and
  flag. My previous tests were limited to bench_rollover, which only
  stresses the flag. The test now completes safely. it still gives an
  error for mode rollover, because it does not expect the new headroom
  (ROOM_NORMAL) requirement. I will send a separate patch to the test.

I should have run this test and caught this before submission, of
course. Apologies for the oversight.
