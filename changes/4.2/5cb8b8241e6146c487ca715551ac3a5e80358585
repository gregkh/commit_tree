writeback: use unlocked_inode_to_wb transaction in inode_congested()

Similar to wb stat updates, inode_congested() accesses the associated
wb of an inode locklessly, which will break with foreign inode wb
switching.  This path updates inode_congested() to use unlocked inode
wb access transaction introduced by the previous patch.

Combined with the previous two patches, this makes all wb list and
access operations to be protected by either of inode->i_lock,
wb->list_lock, or mapping->tree_lock while wb switching is in
progress.
