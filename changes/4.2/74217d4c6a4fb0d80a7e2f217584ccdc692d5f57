iw_cxgb4: support for bar2 qid densities exceeding the page size

Handle this configuration:

        Queues Per Page * SGE BAR2 Queue Register Area Size > Page Size

Use cxgb4_bar2_sge_qregs() to obtain the proper location within the
bar2 region for a given qid.

Rework the DB and GTS write functions to make use of this bar2 info.
