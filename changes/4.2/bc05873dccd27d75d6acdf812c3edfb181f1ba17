writeback: make writeback_in_progress() take bdi_writeback instead of backing_dev_info

writeback_in_progress() currently takes @bdi and returns whether
writeback is in progress on its root wb (bdi_writeback).  In
preparation for cgroup writeback support, make it take wb instead.
While at it, make it an inline function.

This patch doesn't make any functional difference.
