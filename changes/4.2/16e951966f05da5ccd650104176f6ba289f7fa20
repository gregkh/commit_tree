mm: oom_kill: clean up victim marking and exiting interfaces

Rename unmark_oom_victim() to exit_oom_victim().  Marking and unmarking
are related in functionality, but the interface is not symmetrical at
all: one is an internal OOM killer function used during the killing, the
other is for an OOM victim to signal its own death on exit later on.
This has locking implications, see follow-up changes.

While at it, rename mark_tsk_oom_victim() to mark_oom_victim(), which
is easier on the eye.
