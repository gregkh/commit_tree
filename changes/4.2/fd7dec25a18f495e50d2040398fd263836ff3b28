batman-adv: Fix memory leak on tt add with invalid vlan

The object tt_local is allocated with kmalloc and not initialized when the
function batadv_tt_local_add checks for the vlan. But this function can
only cleanup the object when the (not yet initialized) reference counter of
the object is 1. This is unlikely and thus the object would leak when the
vlan could not be found.

Instead the uninitialized object tt_local has to be freed manually and the
pointer has to set to NULL to avoid calling the function which would try to
decrement the reference counter of the not existing object.
