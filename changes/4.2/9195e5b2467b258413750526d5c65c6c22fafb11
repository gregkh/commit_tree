[media] msi001: revise synthesizer calculation

Update synthesizer calculation to model I prefer nowadays. It is mostly
just renaming some variables, but also minor functionality change how
integer and fractional part are divided (using div_u64_rem()). Also, add
'schematic' of synthesizer following my current understanding.
