KVM: MMU: fix decoding cache type from MTRR

There are some bugs in current get_mtrr_type();
1: bit 1 of mtrr_state->enabled is corresponding bit 11 of
   IA32_MTRR_DEF_TYPE MSR which completely control MTRR's enablement
   that means other bits are ignored if it is cleared

2: the fixed MTRR ranges are controlled by bit 0 of
   mtrr_state->enabled (bit 10 of IA32_MTRR_DEF_TYPE)

3: if MTRR is disabled, UC is applied to all of physical memory rather
   than mtrr_state->def_type
