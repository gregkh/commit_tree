powerpc: use subsys_initcall for Freescale Local Bus

The FSL_SOC option is bool, and hence this code is either
present or absent.  It will never be modular, so using
module_init as an alias for __initcall is rather misleading.

Fix this up now, so that we can relocate module_init from
init.h into module.h in the future.  If we don't do this, we'd
have to add module.h to obviously non-modular code, and that
would be a worse thing.

Note that direct use of __initcall is discouraged, vs. one
of the priority categorized subgroups.  As __initcall gets
mapped onto device_initcall, our use of subsys_initcall (which
makes sense for bus code) will thus change this registration
from level 6-device to level 4-subsys (i.e. slightly earlier).
However no observable impact of that small difference has
been observed during testing, or is expected.
