MIPS: Loongson: Naming style cleanup and rework

Currently, code of Loongson-2/3 is under loongson directory and code of
Loongson-1 is under loongson1 directory. Besides, there are Kconfig
options such as MACH_LOONGSON and MACH_LOONGSON1. This naming style is
very ugly and confusing. Since Loongson-2/3 are both 64-bit general-
purpose CPU while Loongson-1 is 32-bit SoC, we rename both file names
and Kconfig symbols from loongson/loongson1 to loongson64/loongson32.
