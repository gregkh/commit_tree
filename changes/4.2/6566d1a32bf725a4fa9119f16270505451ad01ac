zram: add dynamic device add/remove functionality

We currently don't support on-demand device creation.  The one and only
way to have N zram devices is to specify num_devices module parameter
(default value: 1).  IOW if, for some reason, at some point, user wants
to have N + 1 devies he/she must umount all the existing devices, unload
the module, load the module passing num_devices equals to N + 1.  And do
this again, if needed.

This patch introduces zram control sysfs class, which has two sysfs
attrs:
- hot_add      -- add a new zram device
- hot_remove   -- remove a specific (device_id) zram device

hot_add sysfs attr is read-only and has only automatic device id
assignment mode (as requested by Minchan Kim).  read operation performed
on this attr creates a new zram device and returns back its device_id or
error status.

Usage example:
	# add a new specific zram device
	cat /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add
	2

	# remove a specific zram device
	echo 4 > /sys/class/zram-control/hot_remove

Returning zram_add() error code back to user (-ENOMEM in this case)

	cat /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add
	cat: /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add: Cannot allocate memory

NOTE, there might be users who already depend on the fact that at least
zram0 device gets always created by zram_init(). Preserve this behavior.
