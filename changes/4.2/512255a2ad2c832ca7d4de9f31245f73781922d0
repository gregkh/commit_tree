Revert "sched/x86_64: Don't save flags on context switch"

This reverts commit:

  2c7577a75837 ("sched/x86_64: Don't save flags on context switch")

It was a nice speedup.  It's also not quite correct: SYSENTER
enables interrupts too early.

We can re-add this optimization once the SYSENTER code is beaten
into shape, which should happen in 4.3 or 4.4.
