can: c_can: Fix default pinmux glitch at init

The previous change 3973c526ae9c (net: can: c_can: Disable pins when CAN
interface is down) causes a slight glitch on the pinctrl settings when used.
Since commit ab78029 (drivers/pinctrl: grab default handles from device core),
the device core will automatically set the default pins. This causes the pins
to be momentarily set to the default and then to the sleep state in
register_c_can_dev(). By adding an optional "enable" state, boards can set the
default pin state to be disabled and avoid the glitch when the switch from
default to sleep first occurs. If the "enable" state is not available
c_can_pinctrl_select_state() falls back to using the "default" pinctrl state.

[Roger Q] - Forward port to v4.2 and use pinctrl_get_select().
