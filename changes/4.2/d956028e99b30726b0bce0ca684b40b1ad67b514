documentation: memory-barriers: Fix smp_mb__before_spinlock() semantics

Our current documentation claims that, when followed by an ACQUIRE,
smp_mb__before_spinlock() orders prior loads against subsequent loads
and stores, which isn't the intent.  This commit therefore fixes the
documentation to state that this sequence orders only prior stores
against subsequent loads and stores.

In addition, the original intent of smp_mb__before_spinlock() was to only
order prior loads against subsequent stores, however, people have started
using it as if it ordered prior loads against subsequent loads and stores.
This commit therefore also updates smp_mb__before_spinlock()'s header
comment to reflect this new reality.
