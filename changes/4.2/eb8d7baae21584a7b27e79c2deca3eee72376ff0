bridge: skip fdb add if the port shouldn't learn

Check in fdb_add_entry() if the source port should learn, similar
check is used in br_fdb_update.
Note that new fdb entries which are added manually or
as local ones are still permitted.
This patch has been tested by running traffic via a bridge port and
switching the port's state, also by manually adding/removing entries
from the bridge's fdb.
