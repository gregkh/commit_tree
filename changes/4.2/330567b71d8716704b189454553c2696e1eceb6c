ipv6: don't reject link-local nexthop on other interface

48ed7b26faa7 ("ipv6: reject locally assigned nexthop addresses") is too
strict; it rejects following corner-case:

ip -6 route add default via fe80::1:2:3 dev eth1

[ where fe80::1:2:3 is assigned to a local interface, but not eth1 ]

Fix this by restricting search to given device if nh is linklocal.

Joint work with Hannes Frederic Sowa.
