block, dm: don't copy bios for request clones

Currently dm-multipath has to clone the bios for every request sent
to the lower devices, which wastes cpu cycles and ties down memory.

This patch instead adds a new REQ_CLONE flag that instructs req_bio_endio
to not complete bios attached to a request, which we set on clone
requests similar to bios in a flush sequence.  With this change I/O
errors on a path failure only get propagated to dm-multipath, which
can then either resubmit the I/O or complete the bios on the original
request.

I've done some basic testing of this on a Linux target with ALUA support,
and it survives path failures during I/O nicely.
