drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.c: resolve sg buffer const-ness issue

do_device_access() takes a separate parameter to indicate the direction of
data transfer, which it used to use to select the appropriate function out
of sg_pcopy_{to,from}_buffer().  However these two functions now have

So this patch makes it bypass these wrappers and call the underlying
function sg_copy_buffer() directly; this has the same calling style as
do_device_access() i.e.  a separate direction-of-transfer parameter and no
pointers-to-const, so skipping the wrappers not only eliminates the
warning, it also make the code simpler :)
