pinctrl: mvebu: armada-38x: fix PCIe functions

A new revision of the Marvell Armada 38x hardware datasheet unveiled
that the definition of some of the PCIe functions were not
correct. This commit fixes the pinctrl driver accordingly.

Some PCIe functions simply do not exist, some of the PCIe functions in
fact were corresponding to other functions, and some PCIe functions
have been added.

Note: the seemingly unrelated removal of spi(cs2) on MPP47 is related:
this function is in fact implemented on MPP43, instead of a PCIe
function.
