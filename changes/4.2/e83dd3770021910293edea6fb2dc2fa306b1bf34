ARM: 8409/1: Mark ret_fast_syscall as a function

ret_fast_syscall runs when user space makes a syscall. However it
needs to be marked as such so the ELF information is correct. Before
it was:

   101: 8000f300     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    2 ret_fast_syscall

But with this change it correctly shows as:

   101: 8000f300    96 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT    2 ret_fast_syscall

I see this function when using perf to unwind call stacks from kernel
space to user space. Without this change I would need to add some
special case logic when using the vmlinux ELF information.
