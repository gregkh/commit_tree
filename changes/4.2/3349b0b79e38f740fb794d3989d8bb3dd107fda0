net: tulip: rearrange order of searching for substrings

Currently, two of the branches are dead code, since an earlier smaller
substring would have been found ("TP" in the "TP_NW" case and either
of "BNC" and "AUI" in the "BNC_AUI" case). Rearrange the strstr()
calls so that the longer strings are searched for first.
