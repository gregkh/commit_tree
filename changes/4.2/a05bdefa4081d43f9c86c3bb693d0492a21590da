net/mlx5_core: Use port number when querying port ptys

Until now, mlx5_query_port_ptys always queried port number one.

Added new argument in the function's prototype so we can also query
the second port. This will be needed  when thr helper will be invoked
from the IB driver on non FPP (Function-Per-Port) devices.
