ACPI / video: Move dmi_check_system from module_init to acpi_video_register

When builtin there is no guarantee in which order module_init functions
are run, so acpi_video_register() may get called from the i915 driver
(if it is also builtin) before acpi_video_init() gets called, resulting
in the dmi quirks not yet being parsed.

This commit moves the dmi_check_system() call to acpi_video_register(),
so that we can be sure the dmi quirks have always been applied before
probing.
