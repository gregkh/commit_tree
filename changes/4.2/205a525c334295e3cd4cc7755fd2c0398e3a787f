random: Add callback API for random pool readiness

The get_blocking_random_bytes API is broken because the wait can
be arbitrarily long (potentially forever) so there is no safe way
of calling it from within the kernel.

This patch replaces it with a callback API instead.  The callback
is invoked potentially from interrupt context so the user needs
to schedule their own work thread if necessary.

In addition to adding callbacks, they can also be removed as
otherwise this opens up a way for user-space to allocate kernel
memory with no bound (by opening algif_rng descriptors and then
closing them).
