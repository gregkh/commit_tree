iio: magn: Add support for BMC150 magnetometer

Add support for the Bosh BMC150 Magnetometer.
The specification can be downloaded from:
http://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/products/dokumente/bmc150/BST-BMC150-DS000-04.pdf.
The chip contains both an accelerometer and a magnetometer.
This patch adds support only for the magnetometer part.

The temperature compensation formulas are based on bmm050_api.c
