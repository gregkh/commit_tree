Test compaction of mlocked memory

Commit commit 5bbe3547aa3b ("mm: allow compaction of unevictable pages")
introduced a sysctl that allows userspace to enable scanning of locked
pages for compaction.  This patch introduces a new test which fragments
main memory and attempts to allocate a number of huge pages to exercise
this compaction logic.

Tested on machines with up to 32 GB RAM. With the patch a much larger
number of huge pages can be allocated than on the kernel without the
patch.

Example output:
On a machine with 16 GB RAM:
sudo make run_tests vm
...
-----------------------
running compaction_test
-----------------------
No of huge pages allocated = 3834
[PASS]
