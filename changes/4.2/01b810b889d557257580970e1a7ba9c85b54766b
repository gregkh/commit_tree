btrfs: make root id query unprivileged

The INO_LOOKUP ioctl can lookup path for a given inode number and is
thus restricted. As a sideefect it can find the root id of the
containing subvolume and we're using this int the 'btrfs inspect rootid'
command.

The restriction is unnecessary in case we set the ioctl args
 args::treeid    = 0
 args::objectid  = 256 (BTRFS_FIRST_FREE_OBJECTID)

Then the path will be empty and the treeid is filled with the root id of
the inode on which the ioctl is called. This behaviour is unchanged,
after the root restriction is removed.
