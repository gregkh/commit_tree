rtc: snvs: fix wakealarm by call enable_irq_wake earlier

When entering suspend while an wakeup alarm is set, enable_set_wake
should make sure that the RTC interrupt keep being enabled and the
.irq_set_wake for the RTC interrupt get called. However, since the
driver uses the suspend_noirq callback, the call to enable_irq_wake
has been made after disabling the interrupts. While .irq_set_wake
has been called properly, the interrupt remained disabled.

Use the suspend callback to call enable_irq_wake early enough to
ensure the RTC interrupt remains enabled.
