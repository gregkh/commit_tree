ARM: fix new BSYM() usage introduced via for-arm-soc branch

Commit 32e55a777f83 ("ARM: 8389/1: Add cpu_resume_arm() for firmwares
that resume in ARM state") needed to introduce a new usage of BSYM()
to fix a problem with a previous patch.  This in turn causes a conflict
with the "bsym" branch which removes this symbol, replacing it with a
'badr' assembly macro.  Fix this up.
