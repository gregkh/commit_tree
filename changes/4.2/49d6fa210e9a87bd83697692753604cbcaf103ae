drm/i915: Always keep crtc_state->active in sync with enable

With the recent modeset internal rework, we wind up setting crtc_state->enable
to false, but leave crtc_state->active as true following a
drmModeSetCrtc(fb=0), which is incorrect.  This mismatch gets caught by
drm_atomic_crtc_check() and causes subsequent atomic operations (such as plane
updates while the CRTC is disabled) to fail.

            drm/i915: Use atomic helpers for computing changed flags

as the commit that actually triggers the regression.

    drm/i915: Set crtc_state->active to false when CRTC is disabled (v2)

is that we know keep state->active/enable in sync for all legacy
modeset paths, as it should be.
