This patch separates out cgroup-defs.h from cgroup.h which has grown a
lot of dependencies.  cgroup-defs.h currently only contains constant
and type definitions and can be used to break circular include
dependency.  While moving, definitions are reordered so that
cgroup-defs.h has consistent logical structure.

This patch is pure reorganization.
