ARM: pxa: fix dm9000 platform data regression

Since dm9000 driver added support for a vcc regulator, platform data
based platforms have their ethernet broken, as the regulator claiming
returns -EPROBE_DEFER and prevents dm9000 loading.

This patch fixes this for all pxa boards using dm9000, by using the
specific regulator_has_full_constraints() function.

This was discovered and tested on the cm-x300 board.
