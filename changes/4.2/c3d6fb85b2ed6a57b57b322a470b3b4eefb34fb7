tipc: fix default link prop regression in nl compat

Default link properties can be set for media or bearer. This
functionality was missed when introducing the NL compatibility layer.

This patch implements this functionality in the compat netlink
layer. It works the same way as it did in the old API. We search for
media and bearers matching the "link name". If we find a matching
media or bearer the link tolerance, priority or window is used as
default for new links on that media or bearer.
