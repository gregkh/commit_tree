libceph: enable ceph in a non-default network namespace

Grab a reference on a network namespace of the 'rbd map' (in case of
rbd) or 'mount' (in case of ceph) process and use that to open sockets
instead of always using init_net and bailing if network namespace is
anything but init_net.  Be careful to not share struct ceph_client
instances between different namespaces and don't add any code in the
!CONFIG_NET_NS case.

This is based on a patch from Hong Zhiguo <zhiguohong@tencent.com>.
