arm,arm64/xen: move Xen initialization earlier

Currently, Xen is initialized/discovered in an initcall. This doesn't
allow us to support earlyprintk or choosing the preferred console when
running on Xen.

The current function xen_guest_init is now split in 2 parts:
    - xen_early_init: Check if there is a Xen node in the device tree
    and setup domain type
    - xen_guest_init: Retrieve the information from the device node and
    initialize Xen (grant table, shared page...)

The former is called in setup_arch, while the latter is an initcall.
