batman-adv: Use only queued fragments when merging

The fragment queueing code now validates the total_size of each fragment,
checks when enough fragments are queued to allow to merge them into a
single packet and if the fragments have the correct size. Therefore, it is
not required to have any other parameter for the merging function than a
list of queued fragments.

This change should avoid problems like in the past when the different skb
from the list and the function parameter were mixed incorrectly.
