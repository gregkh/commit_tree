block: loop: fix another reread part failure

loop_clr_fd() can be run piggyback with lo_release(), and
under this situation, reread partition may always fail because
bd_mutex has been held already.

This patch detects the situation by the reference count, and
call __blkdev_reread_part() to avoid acquiring the lock again.

In the meantime, this patch switches to new kernel APIs
of blkdev_reread_part() and __blkdev_reread_part().
