cfq-iosched: fix the setting of IOPS mode on SSDs

A previous commit wanted to make CFQ default to IOPS mode on
non-rotational storage, however it did so when the queue was
initialized and the non-rotational flag is only set later on
in the probe.

Add an elevator hook that gets called off the add_disk() path,
at that point we know that feature probing has finished, and
we can reliably check for the various flags that drivers can
set.
