batman-adv: Check total_size when queueing fragments

The fragmentation code was replaced in
610bfc6bc99bc83680d190ebc69359a05fc7f605 ("batman-adv: Receive fragmented
packets and merge") by an implementation which handles the queueing+merging
of fragments based on their size and the total_size of the non-fragmented
packet. This total_size is announced by each fragment. The new
implementation doesn't check if the the total_size information of the
packets inside one chain is consistent.

This is consistency check is recommended to allow using any of the packets
in the queue to decide whether all fragments of a packet are received or
not.
