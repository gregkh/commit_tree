xen-blkfront: don't add indirect pages to list when !feature_persistent

We should consider info->feature_persistent when adding indirect page to list
info->indirect_pages, else the BUG_ON() in blkif_free() would be triggered.

When we are using persistent grants the indirect_pages list
should always be empty because blkfront has pre-allocated enough
persistent pages to fill all requests on the ring.
