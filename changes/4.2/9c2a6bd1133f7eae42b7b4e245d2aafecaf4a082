HID: hid-lg4ff: Update a warning message

Update a warning message for a case where device is incorrectly flagged to be
handled by hid-lg4ff in hid-lg. The original warning message was highly
misleading. This warning can be triggered only if a device is flagged to be
handled by hid-lg4ff in hid-lg but hid-lg4ff lacks support for such device.
