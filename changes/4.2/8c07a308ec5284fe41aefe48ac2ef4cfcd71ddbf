sparc: use for_each_sg()

This replaces the plain loop over the sglist array with for_each_sg()
macro which consists of sg_next() function calls.  Since sparc does select
ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN, it is necessary to use for_each_sg() in order to loop
over each sg element.  This also help find problems with drivers that do
not properly initialize their sg tables when CONFIG_DEBUG_SG is enabled.
