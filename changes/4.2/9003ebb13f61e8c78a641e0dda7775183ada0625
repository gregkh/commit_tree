ALSA: usb-audio: Fix runtime PM unbalance

The fix for deadlock in PM in commit [1ee23fe07ee8: ALSA: usb-audio:
Fix deadlocks at resuming] introduced a new check of in_pm flag.
However, the brainless patch author evaluated it in a wrong way
(logical AND instead of logical OR), thus usb_autopm_get_interface()
is wrongly called at probing, leading to unbalance of runtime PM
refcount.

This patch fixes it by correcting the logic.
