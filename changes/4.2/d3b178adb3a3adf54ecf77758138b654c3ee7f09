md: Skip cluster setup for dm-raid

There is a bug that the bitmap superblock isn't initialised properly for
dm-raid, so a new field can have garbage in new fields.
(dm-raid does initialisation in the kernel - md initialised the
 superblock in mdadm).

This means that for dm-raid we cannot currently trust the new ->nodes
field. So:
 - use __GFP_ZERO to initialise the superblock properly for all new
    arrays
 - initialise all fields in bitmap_info in bitmap_new_disk_sb
 - ignore ->nodes for dm arrays (yes, this is a hack)

This bug exposes dm-raid to bug in the (still experimental) md-cluster
code, so it is suitable for -stable.  It does cause crashes.
