x86/fpu: Rename fpu_init() to fpu__cpu_init()

fpu_init() is a bit of a misnomer in that it (falsely) creates the
impression that it's related to the (old) fpu_finit() function,
which initializes FPU ctx state.

Rename it to fpu__cpu_init() to make its boot time initialization
clear, and to move it to the fpu__*() namespace.

Also fix and extend its comment block to point out that it's
called not only on the boot CPU, but on secondary CPUs as well.
