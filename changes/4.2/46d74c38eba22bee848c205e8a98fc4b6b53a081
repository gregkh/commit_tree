staging: slicoss: restore IRQs correctly after slic_cmdq_reset()

We can't save two different values in "flags" so it means that IRQs are
not enabled properly at the end of this function.  This isn't a problem
in the current code because it's always called with IRQs disabled so we
don't want to enable them at the end.

This bug is old but it's thanks to David Matlack's recent cleanups that
Smatch can detect it.
