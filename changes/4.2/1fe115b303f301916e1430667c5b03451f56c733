arm: perf: factor out armv6 pmu driver

Now that the core arm perf code maintains no global state and all
microarchitecture-specific PMU data can be fed in through the shared
probe function, it's possible to use it as a library and get rid of the
C file includes we have currently.

This patch factors out the ARMv6-specific portions out into the ARMv6
driver. For the moment this is always built if perf event support is
enabled, but the preprocessor guards will leave behind an empty file.
