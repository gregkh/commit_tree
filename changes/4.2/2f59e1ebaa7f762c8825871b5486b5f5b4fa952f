net: Add flow_keys digest

Some users of flow keys (well just sch_choke now) need to pass
flow_keys in skbuff cb, and use them for exact comparisons of flows
so that skb->hash is not sufficient. In order to increase size of
the flow_keys structure, we introduce another structure for
the purpose of passing flow keys in skbuff cb. We limit this structure
to sixteen bytes, and we will technically treat this as a digest of
flow_keys struct hence its name flow_keys_digest. In the first
incaranation we just copy the flow_keys structure up to 16 bytes--
this is the same information previously passed in the cb. In the
future, we'll adapt this for larger flow_keys and could use something
like SHA-1 over the whole flow_keys to improve the quality of the
digest.
