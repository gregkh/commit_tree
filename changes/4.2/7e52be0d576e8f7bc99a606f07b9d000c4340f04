spi: bcm2835: fix kbuild compile warnings/errors and a typo

fixes several warnings/error emmitted by the kbuild system:
* warn: cast from pointer to integer of different size
  using size_t instead of u32
* error: 'SZ_4K' undeclared
  moved to PAGE_SIZE and PAGE_MASK instead

Review showed also a typo in the same code where tx_buff
was checked twice instead of checking both rx and tx_buff.
