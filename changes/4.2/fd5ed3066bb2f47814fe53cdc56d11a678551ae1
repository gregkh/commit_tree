MIPS: kernel: smp-cps: Fix 64-bit compatibility errors due to pointer casting

Commit 1d8f1f5a780a ("MIPS: smp-cps: hotplug support") added hotplug
support in the SMP/CPS implementation but it introduced a few build problems
on 64-bit kernels due to pointer being casted to and from 'int' C types. We
fix this problem by using 'unsigned long' instead which should match the size
of the pointers in 32/64-bit kernels. Finally, we fix the comment since the
CM base address is loaded to v1($3) instead of v0.

Fixes the following build problems:

arch/mips/kernel/smp-cps.c: In function 'wait_for_sibling_halt':
arch/mips/kernel/smp-cps.c:366:17: error: cast from pointer to integer of
different size [-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast]
[...]
arch/mips/kernel/smp-cps.c: In function 'cps_cpu_die':
arch/mips/kernel/smp-cps.c:427:13: error: cast to pointer
from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]

cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
