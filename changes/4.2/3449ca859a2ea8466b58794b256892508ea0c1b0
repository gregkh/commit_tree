drm/i915/bxt: Increase DDI buf idle timeout

For BXT, DDI buf idle timeout delay needs to be increased to 16us.

Since this is a timeout value and we return as soon as the condition is
realized, no penalty incurred for other platforms.

v2:
- remove TIMEOUT macro used only at a single place (Daniel)
