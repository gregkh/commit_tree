PM / tick: Add tracepoints for suspend-to-idle diagnostics

Add suspend/resume tracepoints to tick_freeze() and tick_unfreeze()
to catch when timekeeping is suspended and resumed during suspend-to-idle
so as to be able to check whether or not we enter the "frozen" state
and to measure the time spent in it.
