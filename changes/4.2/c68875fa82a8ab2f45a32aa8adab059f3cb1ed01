net: fs_enet: mask interrupts for TX partial frames.

We are not interested in interrupts for partially transmitted frames.
Unlike SCC and FCC, the FEC doesn't handle the I bit in buffer
descriptors, instead it defines two interrupt bits, TXB and TXF.

We have to mask TXB in order to only get interrupts once the
frame is fully transmitted.
