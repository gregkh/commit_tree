tcp: halves tcp_mem[] limits

Allowing tcp to use ~19% of physical memory is way too much,
and allowed bugs to be hidden. Add to this that some drivers use a full
page per incoming frame, so real cost can be twice the advertized one.

Reduce tcp_mem by 50 % as a first step to sanity.

tcp_mem[0,1,2] defaults are now 4.68%, 6.25%, 9.37% of physical memory.
