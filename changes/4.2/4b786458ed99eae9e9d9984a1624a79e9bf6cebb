spi: restore rx/tx_buf in case of unset CONFIG_HAS_DMA

The case where spi_master sets the flags SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX/TX while
CONFIG_HAS_DMA is unset (which is unlikley) together with a driver
that reuses spi_messages with rx/tx_buff set to NULL, can result in:
* data disclosure over the SPI (for tx_buf == NULL)
* memory corruption (for rx_buf == NULL)

This happenes when dummy_rx/dummy_tx are changing address due to krealloc
or free and an allocation of the memory by a different part of the kernel.
