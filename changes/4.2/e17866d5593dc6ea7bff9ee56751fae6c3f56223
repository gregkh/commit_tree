powerpc/eeh: fix powernv_eeh_wait_state delay logic

As the comment indicates, powernv_eeh_get_state() will inform EEH core to
delay 1 second. This means the delay doesn't happen when
powernv_eeh_get_state() returns.

This patch moves the delay subtraction just before msleep(), which is the
same logic in pseries_eeh_wait_state().
