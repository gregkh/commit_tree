leds: unify the location of led-trigger API

Part of led-trigger API was in the private drivers/leds/leds.h header.
Move it to the include/linux/leds.h header to unify the API location
and announce it as public. It has been already exported from
led-triggers.c with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro. The no-op definitions are
changed from macros to inline to match the style of the surrounding code.
