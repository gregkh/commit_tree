kernel/module.c: avoid ifdefs for sig_enforce declaration

There's no need to require an ifdef over the declaration
of sig_enforce as IS_ENABLED() can be used. While at it,
there's no harm in exposing this kernel parameter outside of
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG as it'd be a no-op on non module sig
kernels.

Now, technically we should in theory be able to remove
the #ifdef'ery over the declaration of the module parameter
as we are also trusting the bool_enable_only code for
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG kernels but for now remain paranoid
and keep it.

With time if no one can put a bullet through bool_enable_only
and if there are no technical requirements over not exposing
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE with the measures in place by
bool_enable_only we could remove this last ifdef.
