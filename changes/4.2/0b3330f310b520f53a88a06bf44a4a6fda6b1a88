watchdog: omap: simplify assignment of bootstatus

Instead of using an over-long expression involving the ?: operator use
an if and instead of an else branch rely on the fact that the data
structure was allocated using devm_kzalloc. This also allows to put the
used helper variable into a more local scope.

There is no functional change.
