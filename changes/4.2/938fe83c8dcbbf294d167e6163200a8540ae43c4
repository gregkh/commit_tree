net/mlx5_core: New device capabilities handling

- Query all supported types of dev caps on driver load.
- Store the Cap data outbox per cap type into driver private data.
- Introduce new Macros to access/dump stored caps (using the auto
  generated data types).
- Obsolete SW representation of dev caps (no need for SW copy for each
  cap).
- Modify IB driver to use new macros for checking caps.
