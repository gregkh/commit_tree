tcp: double default TSQ output bytes limit

Xen virtual network driver has higher latency than a physical NIC.
Having only 128K as limit for TSQ introduced 30% regression in guest
throughput.

This patch raises the limit to 256K. This reduces the regression to 8%.
This buys us more time to work out a proper solution in the long run.
