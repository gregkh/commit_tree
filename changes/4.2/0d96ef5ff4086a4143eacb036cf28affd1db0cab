hpsa: clean up host, channel, target, lun prints

We had a mix of formats used for specifying controller, bus, target,
and lun address of devices.

change to the format used by the scsi midlayer and upper layer (2:3:0:0)
so you can easily follow the information from hpsa to scsi midlayer
to sd upper layer.

Also add this information:
- product ID
- vendor ID
- RAID level
- SSD Smath Path capable and enabled
- exposure level (sg-only)

Example:
hpsa 0000:04:00.0: added scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     HP LOGICAL VOLUME   RAID-0 SSDSmartPathCap+ En+ Exp=4
scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     HP       LOGICAL VOLUME   10.0 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
sd 2:0:0:0: [sdr] 12501713072 512-byte logical blocks: (6.40 TB/5.82 TiB)
sd 2:0:0:0: [sdr] 4096-byte physical blocks
sd 2:0:0:0: [sdr] Attached SCSI disk
sd 2:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg20 type 0
