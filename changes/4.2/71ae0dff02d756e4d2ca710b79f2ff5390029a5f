netfilter: xtables: use percpu rule counters

The binary arp/ip/ip6tables ruleset is stored per cpu.

The only reason left as to why we need percpu duplication are the rule
counters embedded into ipt_entry et al -- since each cpu has its own copy
of the rules, all counters can be lockless.

The downside is that the more cpus are supported, the more memory is
required.  Rules are not just duplicated per online cpu but for each
possible cpu, i.e. if maxcpu is 144, then rule is duplicated 144 times,
not for the e.g. 64 cores present.

To save some memory and also improve utilization of shared caches it
would be preferable to only store the rule blob once.

So we first need to separate counters and the rule blob.

Instead of using entry->counters, allocate this percpu and store the
percpu address in entry->counters.pcnt on CONFIG_SMP.

This change makes no sense as-is; it is merely an intermediate step to
remove the percpu duplication of the rule set in a followup patch.
