cpufreq: Allow freq_table to be obtained for offline CPUs

Users of freq table may want to access it for any CPU from
policy->related_cpus mask. One such user is cpu-cooling layer. It gets a
list of 'clip_cpus' (equivalent to policy->related_cpus) during
registration and tries to get freq_table for the first CPU of this mask.

If the CPU, for which it tries to fetch freq_table, is offline,
cpufreq_frequency_get_table() fails. This happens because it relies on
cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() for its functioning which returns policy only for
online CPUs.

The fix is to access the policy data structure for the given CPU
directly (which also returns a valid policy for offline CPUs), but the
policy itself has to be active (meaning that at least one CPU using it
is online) for the frequency table to be returned.

Because we will be using 'cpufreq_cpu_data' now, which is internal to
the cpufreq core, move cpufreq_frequency_get_table() to cpufreq.c.
