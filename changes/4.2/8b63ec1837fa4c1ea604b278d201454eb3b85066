phylib: Make PHYs children of their MDIO bus, not the bus' parent.

commit 18ee49ddb0d2 ("phylib: rename mii_bus::dev to mii_bus::parent")
changed the parent of PHY devices from the bus to the bus parent.

Then, commit 4dea547fef1b ("phylib: rework to prepare for OF
registration of PHYs") moved the code into phy_device.c

At this point, it is somewhat unclear why the change was seen as
necessary.  But, when we look at the device model tree in
/sys/devices, it is clearly incorrect.  The PHYs should be children of
their MDIO bus.

Change the PHY's parent device to be the MDIO bus device.
