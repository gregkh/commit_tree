rocker: make rocker_port_internal_vlan_id_{get, put}() non-transactional

The motivation for this is that rocker_port_internal_vlan_id_{get,put} appear
to only partially implement the transaction model: memory allocation
and freeing is transactional, but hash and bitmap manipulation is not.

The latter could be fixed, however, as it is not currently exercised
due to trans always being SWITCHDEV_TRANS_NONE it seems cleaner
to make rocker_port_internal_vlan_id_get non-transactional.

This problem was introduced by c4f20321d968 ("rocker: support
prepare-commit transaction model").

Found by inspection.
I do not believe that this change should have any run-time effect.
