perf bench numa: Fix to show proper convergence stats

With commit: e1e455f4f4d3 (perf tools: Work around lack of sched_getcpu
in glibc < 2.6), perf_bench numa mem with -c or -m option is not able to
correctly calculate convergence.

With the above commit, sched_getcpu always seems to return -1. The
intention of commit e1e455f was to add a sched_getcpu in glibc < 2.6.
Hence keep the sched_getcpu definition under an ifdef.

This regression happened occurred between v4.0 and v4.1
