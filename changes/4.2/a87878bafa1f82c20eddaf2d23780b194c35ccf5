acpi-video-detect: Move acpi_osi_is_win8 to osl.c

acpi_osi_is_win8 needs access to acpi_gbl_osi_data which is not exported,
so move it to osl.c. Alternatively we could export acpi_gbl_osi_data but
that seems undesirable.

This allows video_detect.c to be build as a module, besides that
acpi_osi_is_win8() is something which does not really belong in
video_detect.c in the first place.
