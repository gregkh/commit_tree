sched / idle: Eliminate the "reflect" check from cpuidle_idle_call()

Since cpuidle_reflect() should only be called if the idle state
to enter was selected by cpuidle_select(), there is the "reflect"
variable in cpuidle_idle_call() whose value is used to determine
whether or not that is the case.

However, if the entire code run between the conditional setting
"reflect" and the call to cpuidle_reflect() is moved to a separate
function, it will be possible to call that new function in both
branches of the conditional, in which case cpuidle_reflect() will
only need to be called from one of them too and the "reflect"
variable won't be necessary any more.

This eliminates one check made by cpuidle_idle_call() on the majority
of its invocations, so change the code as described.
