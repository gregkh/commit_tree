usb: phy: Remove the phy-rcar-gen2-usb driver

The phy-rcar-gen2-usb driver, which supports legacy platform data only,
is no longer used since commit a483dcbfa21f919c ("ARM: shmobile: lager:
Remove legacy board support").

This driver was superseded by the DT-only phy-rcar-gen2 driver, which
was introduced in commit 1233f59f745b237d ("phy: Renesas R-Car Gen2 PHY
driver").
