Add virtio gpu driver.

This patch adds a kms driver for the virtio gpu.  The xorg modesetting
driver can handle the device just fine, the framebuffer for fbcon is
there too.

Qemu patches for the host side are under review currently.

The pci version of the device comes in two variants: with and without
vga compatibility.  The former has a extra memory bar for the vga
framebuffer, the later is a pure virtio device.  The only concern for
this driver is that in the virtio-vga case we have to kick out the
firmware framebuffer.

Initial revision has only 2d support, 3d (virgl) support requires
some more work on the qemu side and will be added later.
