ath10k: move driver state check before setting throttle

Since thermal daemon is unaware of the device state, it might
try to adjust the throttle state when the device is powered down.
So the driver caches the value and will configure it while
powering up the target. The cached value will be programed later
once the device is brought up. In such case, returning error
status is confusing and misleading the user application. Hence
moving the driver state check before sending wmi command to target.
