firmware: fix __getname() missing failure check

The request_firmware*() APIs uses __getname() to iterate
over the list of paths possible for firmware to be found,
the code however never checked for failure on __getname().
Although *very unlikely*, this can still happen. Add the
missing check.

There is still no checks on the concatenation of the path
and filename passed, that requires a bit more work and
subsequent patches address this. The commit that introduced
this is abb139e7 ("firmware: teach the kernel to load
firmware files directly from the filesystem").
