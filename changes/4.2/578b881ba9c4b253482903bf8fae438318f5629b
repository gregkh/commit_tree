NTB: Add tool test client

This is a simple debugging driver that enables the doorbell and
scratch pad registers to be read and written from the debugfs.  This
tool enables more complicated debugging to be scripted from user space.
This driver may be used to test that your ntb hardware and drivers are
functioning at a basic level.
