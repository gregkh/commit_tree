namei: path_init() calling conventions change

* lift link_path_walk() into callers; moving it down into path_init()
had been a mistake.  Stack footprint, among other things...
* do _not_ call path_cleanup() after path_init() failure; on all failure
exits out of it we have nothing for path_cleanup() to do
* have path_init() return pathname or ERR_PTR(-E...)
