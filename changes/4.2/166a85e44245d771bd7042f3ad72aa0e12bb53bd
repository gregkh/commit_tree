gpio: remove gpiod_sysfs_set_active_low

Remove gpiod_sysfs_set_active_low (and gpio_sysfs_set_active_low) which
allowed code to change the polarity of a gpio line even after it had
been exported through sysfs.

Drivers should not care, and generally does not know, about gpio-line
polarity which is a hardware feature that needs to be described by
firmware.

It is currently possible to define gpio-line polarity in device-tree and
acpi firmware or using platform data. Userspace can also change the
polarity through sysfs.

Note that drivers using the legacy gpio interface could still use
GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW to change the polarity before exporting the gpio.

There are no in-kernel users of this interface.
