x86/fpu: Rename sanitize_i387_state() to fpstate_sanitize_xstate()

So the sanitize_i387_state() function has the following purpose:
on CPUs that support optimized xstate saving instructions, an
FPU fpstate might end up having partially uninitialized data.

This function initializes that data.

Note that the function name is a misnomer and confusing on two levels,
not only is it not i387 specific at all, but it is the exact opposite:
it only matters on xstate CPUs.

So rename sanitize_i387_state() and __sanitize_i387_state() to
fpstate_sanitize_xstate() and __fpstate_sanitize_xstate(),
to clearly express the purpose and usage of the function.

We'll further clean up this function in the next patch.
