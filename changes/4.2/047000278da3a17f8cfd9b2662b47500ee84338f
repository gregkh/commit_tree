ASoC: rsrc-card: cleanup for DPCM

rsrc-card driver is based on simple-card driver which is caring about
CPU / Codec connection. OTOH, rsrc-card is used for DPCM system.
FE portion is constituted by CPU and dummy Codec, and BE is constituted
by dummy CPU and Codec in DPCM system.
Because of this, current rsrc-card is doing pointless method. It works well
if FE/BE was 1:1, but not good for multi FE/BE.
This patch cleanups rsrc-card driver for DPCM. and this is prepare for
MIX support for Renesas sound driver.
