ACPI / scan: Add support for ACPI _CLS device matching

Device drivers typically use ACPI _HIDs/_CIDs listed in struct device_driver
acpi_match_table to match devices. However, for generic drivers, we do not
want to list _HID for all supported devices. Also, certain classes of devices
do not have _CID (e.g. SATA, USB). Instead, we can leverage ACPI _CLS,
which specifies PCI-defined class code (i.e. base-class, subclass and
programming interface). This patch adds support for matching ACPI devices using
the _CLS method.

To support loadable module, current design uses _HID or _CID to match device's
modalias. With the new way of matching with _CLS this would requires modification
to the current ACPI modalias key to include _CLS. This patch appends PCI-defined
class-code to the existing ACPI modalias as following.

    acpi:<HID>:<CID1>:<CID2>:..:<CIDn>:<bbsspp>:
E.g:
    # cat /sys/devices/platform/AMDI0600:00/modalias
    acpi:AMDI0600:010601:

where bb is th base-class code, ss is te sub-class code, and pp is the
programming interface code

Since there would not be _HID/_CID in the ACPI matching table of the driver,
this patch adds a field to acpi_device_id to specify the matching _CLS.

    static const struct acpi_device_id ahci_acpi_match[] = {
        { ACPI_DEVICE_CLASS(PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_SATA_AHCI, 0xffffff) },
        {},
    };

In this case, the corresponded entry in modules.alias file would be:

    alias acpi*:010601:* ahci_platform
