perf trace: Validate syscall list passed via -e argument

The 'trace' tool was accepting any names passed and just looking if
syscalls returned via the raw_syscalls:* tracepoints were in that list,
leading to it accepting perf events and then never finding any, as those
are not valid syscall names, confusing users.

Fix it by checking each entry in the list using audit_name_to_syscall,
telling the user which entries are invalid and suggesting where to look
for valid syscall names.

E.g:

  [root@zoo ~]# trace -e open,foo,bar,close,baz
  Error: Invalid syscall bar, baz, foo
  Hint:	 try 'perf list syscalls:sys_enter_*'
  Hint:	 and: 'man syscalls'
  [root@zoo ~]#
