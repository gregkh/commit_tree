x86/mpx: Do not set ->vm_ops on MPX VMAs

MPX setups private anonymous mapping, but uses vma->vm_ops too.
This can confuse core VM, as it relies on vm->vm_ops to
distinguish file VMAs from anonymous.

As result we will get SIGBUS, because handle_pte_fault() thinks
it's file VMA without vm_ops->fault and it doesn't know how to
handle the situation properly.

Let's fix that by not setting ->vm_ops.

We don't really need ->vm_ops here: MPX VMA can be detected with
VM_MPX flag. And vma_merge() will not merge MPX VMA with non-MPX
VMA, because ->vm_flags won't match.

The only thing left is name of VMA. I'm not sure if it's part of
ABI, or we can just drop it. The patch keep it by providing
arch_vma_name() on x86.
