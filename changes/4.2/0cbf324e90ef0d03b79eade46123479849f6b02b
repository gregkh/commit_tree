sound/oss: use schedule_timeout_interruptible()

API consolidation with coccinelle found:
./sound/oss/msnd_pinnacle.c:1292:2-18:
        consolidation with schedule_timeout_*() recommended

This is a 1:1 conversion of the current calls to an available helper
only - so only an API consolidation to improve readability.

Patch was compile tested with x86_64_defconfig

Patch is against 4.1-rc5 (localversion-next is -next-20150529)
