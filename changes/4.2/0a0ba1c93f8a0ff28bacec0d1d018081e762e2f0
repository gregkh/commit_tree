rcu: Adjust ->lock acquisition for tasks no longer migrating

Tasks are no longer migrated away from a given rcu_node structure
when all CPUs corresponding to that rcu_node structure have gone offline.
This means that rcu_read_unlock_special() no longer needs to loop
retrying rcu_node ->lock acquisition because the current task is
guaranteed to stay put.

This commit takes a small and paranoid step towards relying on this
guarantee by placing a WARN_ON_ONCE() just after the early exit from
the lock-acquisition loop.
