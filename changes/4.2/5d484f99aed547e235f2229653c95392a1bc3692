perf top: Allow disabling/enabling events dynamicly

Now it is possible to press CTRL+z at anytime and that will disable the
events being monitored, essentially turning 'top' into 'report', with
pressing CTRL+z again making it enable the events again, returning to
the 'top' behaviour, i.e. dynamic + decaying of older samples.

One may want, for instance, play with:

    -d, --delay <n>       number of seconds to delay between refreshes

and:

    -z, --zero            zero history across updates

Plus CTRL+z to see only the events since last zeroing, etc.
