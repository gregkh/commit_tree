rcu: Remove prompt for RCU implementation

The RCU implementation is chosen based on PREEMPT and SMP config options
and is not really a user-selectable choice.  This commit removes the
menu entry, given that there is not much point in calling something a
choice when there is in fact no choice..  The TINY_RCU, TREE_RCU, and
PREEMPT_RCU Kconfig options continue to be selected based solely on the
values of the PREEMPT and SMP options.
