serial: tegra: Use unsigned types for RX and TX byte counts

The function tty_insert_flip_string() takes an argument "size" which is
of type size_t. This is an unsigned type. Update the count,
rx_bytes_requested and tx_bytes_requested in the tegra serial driver to
be unsigned integers so that an unsigned type is passed to
tty_insert_flip_string().
