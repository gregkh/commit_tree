powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Introduce pnv_pci_ioda2_set_window

This is a part of moving DMA window programming to an iommu_ops
callback. pnv_pci_ioda2_set_window() takes an iommu_table_group as
a first parameter (not pnv_ioda_pe) as it is going to be used as
a callback for VFIO DDW code.

This should cause no behavioural change.
