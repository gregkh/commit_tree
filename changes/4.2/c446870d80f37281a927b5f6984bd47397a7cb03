perf session: Add hooks to allow transparent decoding of AUX area tracing data

Hook into session processing so that AUX area decoding can synthesize
events transparently to the tools.

The advantages of transparent decoding are that tools can be used
directly with perf.data files containing AUX area tracing data, which is
easier for the user and more efficient than having a separate decoding
tool.

This will work as follows:

1. Tools will feed auxtrace events to the decoder using
   perf_tool->auxtrace() (support for that still to come).

2. The decoder can process side-band events as needed due
   to the auxtrace->process_event() hook.

3. The decoder can deliver synthesized events into the
   event stream using perf_session__deliver_synth_event().

Note the expectation is that decoding will work on data that is
time-ordered with respect to the per-cpu or per-thread contexts that
were recorded.
