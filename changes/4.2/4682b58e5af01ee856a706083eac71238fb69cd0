[media] qt1010: avoid going past array

As reported by smatch:
	drivers/media/tuners/qt1010.c:357 qt1010_init() error: buffer overflow 'i2c_data' 34 <= 34

This should not happen with the current code, as the i2c_data array
doesn't end with a QT1010_M1, but it doesn't hurt add a BUG_ON
to notify if one modifies it and breaks.
