mm: meminit: only set page reserved in the memblock region

Currently each page struct is set as reserved upon initialization.  This
patch leaves the reserved bit clear and only sets the reserved bit when it
is known the memory was allocated by the bootmem allocator.  This makes it
easier to distinguish between uninitialised struct pages and reserved
struct pages in later patches.
