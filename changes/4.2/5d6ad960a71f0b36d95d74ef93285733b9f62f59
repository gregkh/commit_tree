tracing: Rename FTRACE_EVENT_FL_* flags to EVENT_FILE_FL_*

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The FTRACE_EVENT_FL_* flags are flags to
do with the trace_event files in the tracefs directory. They are not related
to function tracing. Rename them to a more descriptive name.
