ACPI / property: Refine consistency check for PRP0001

Refine the check for the presence of the "compatible" property
if the PRP0001 device ID is present in the device's list of
ACPI/PNP IDs to also print the message if _DSD is missing
entirely or the format of it is incorrect.

One special case to take into accout is that the "compatible"
property need not be provided for devices having the PRP0001
device ID in their lists of ACPI/PNP IDs if they are ancestors
of PRP0001 devices with the "compatible" property present.
This is to cover heriarchies of device objects where the kernel
is only supposed to use a struct device representation for the
topmost one and the others represent, for example, functional
blocks of a composite device.

While at it, reduce the log level of the message to "info"
and reduce the log level of the "broken _DSD" message to
"debug" (noise reduction).
