SUNRPC: Fix a backchannel race

We need to allow the server to send a new request immediately after we've
replied to the previous one. Right now, there is a window between the
send and the release of the old request in rpc_put_task(), where the
server could send us a new backchannel RPC call, and we have no
request to service it.
