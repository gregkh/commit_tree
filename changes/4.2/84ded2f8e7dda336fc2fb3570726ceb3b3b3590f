Revert "libata: Implement support for sense data reporting"

This reverts commit fe7173c206de63fc28475ee6ae42ff95c05692de.

As implemented, ACS-4 sense reporting for ATA devices bypasses error
diagnosis and handling in libata degrading EH behavior significantly.
Revert the related changes for now.

ATA_ID_COMMAND_SET_3/4 constants are not reverted as they're used by
later changes.
