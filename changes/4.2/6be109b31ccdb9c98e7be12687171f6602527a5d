phy: core: Add devm_of_phy_get_by_index to phy-core

Some generic drivers, such as ehci, may use multiple phys and for such
drivers referencing phy(s) by name(s) does not make sense. Instead of
inventing new naming schemes and using custom code to iterate through them,
such drivers are better of using nameless phy bindings and using this newly
introduced API to iterate through them.
