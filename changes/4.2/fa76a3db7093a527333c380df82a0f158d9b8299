pinctrl: allow exlusive GPIO/mux pin allocation

Disallow simultaneous use of the the GPIO and peripheral mux
functions by setting a flag "strict" in struct pinctrl_desc.

The blackfin pinmux and gpio controller doesn't allow user to
set up a pin for both GPIO and peripheral function. So, add flag
strict in struct pinctrl_desc to check both gpio_owner and
mux_owner before approving the pin request.

v2-changes:
- if strict flag is set, check gpio_owner and mux_onwer in if and
  else clause

v3-changes:
- add kerneldoc for this struct
- augment Documentation/pinctrl.txt
