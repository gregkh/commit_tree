sched: Move the loadavg code to a more obvious location

I could not find the loadavg code.. turns out it was hidden in a file
called proc.c. It further got mingled up with the cruft per rq load
indexes (which we really want to get rid of).

Move the per rq load indexes into the fair.c load-balance code (that's
the only thing that uses them) and rename proc.c to loadavg.c so we
can find it again.
