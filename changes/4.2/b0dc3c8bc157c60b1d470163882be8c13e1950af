dm btree: add ref counting ops for the leaves of top level btrees

When using nested btrees, the top leaves of the top levels contain
block addresses for the root of the next tree down.  If we shadow a
shared leaf node the leaf values (sub tree roots) should be incremented
accordingly.

This is only an issue if there is metadata sharing in the top levels.
Which only occurs if metadata snapshots are being used (as is possible
with dm-thinp).  And could result in a block from the thinp metadata
snap being reused early, thus corrupting the thinp metadata snap.
