switchdev: convert fib_ipv4_add/del over to switchdev_port_obj_add/del

The IPv4 FIB ops convert nicely to the switchdev objs and we're left with
only four switchdev ops: port get/set and port add/del.  Other objs will
follow, such as FDB.  So go ahead and convert IPv4 FIB over to switchdev
obj for consistency, anticipating more objs to come.
