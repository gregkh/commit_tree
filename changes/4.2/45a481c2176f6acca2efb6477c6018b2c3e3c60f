clk: iproc: fix memory leak from clock name

of_property_read_string_index takes array of pointers and assign them to
strings read from device tree property. No additional memory allocation
is needed prior to calling of_property_read_string_index. In fact, since
the array of pointers will be re-assigned to other strings, any memory
that it points to prior to calling of_property_read_string_index will be
leaked
