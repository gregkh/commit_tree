brcmfmac: remove watchdog reset from brcmf_pcie_buscoreprep()

The watchdog reset as done in brcmf_pcie_buscoreprep() is not
sufficient. It needs to modify PCIe core registers as well
which is properly done by brcmf_pcie_reset_device() after the
chip recognition is done. So the faulty watchdog reset can be
removed as it was causing driver reload to fail and hang the
system requiring a power-cycle. Instead the call to to the
brcmf_pcie_reset_device() function is done twice in the unload.
