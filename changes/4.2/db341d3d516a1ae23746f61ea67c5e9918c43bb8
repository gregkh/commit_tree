coresight: tpiu: retrieve and handle atclk

As can be seen from the datasheet of the CoreSight
Components, DDI0314H page A-19 the TPIU has a clock signal
apart from the AHB interconnect ("amba_pclk", that we're
already handling) called ATCLK, ARM Trace Clock, that SoC
implementers may provide from an entirely different clock
source. So to model this correctly create an optional
path for handling ATCLK alongside the PCLK so we don't
break old platforms that only define PCLK ("amba_pclk") but
still makes it possible for SoCs that have both clock signals
(such as the DB8500) to fetch and prepare/enable/disable/
unprepare both clocks in conjunction.

The ATCLK is enabled and disabled using the runtime PM
callbacks.
