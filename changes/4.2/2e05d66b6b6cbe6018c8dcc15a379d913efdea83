mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: remove duplicated dts parsing

After commit 8d86e4fcccf6 ("mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Call mmc_of_parse()"),
we do not need those duplicated parsing anymore.

Note: fsl,cd-controller is also deleted due to the driver does
not support controller card detection anymore after switch to runtime pm.
And there's no user of it right now in device tree.

wp-gpios is kept because we're still support fsl,wp-controller,
so we need a way to check if it's gpio wp or controller wp.
