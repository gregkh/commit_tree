security_syslog() should be called once only

The final version of commit 637241a900cb ("kmsg: honor dmesg_restrict
sysctl on /dev/kmsg") lost few hooks, as result security_syslog() are
processed incorrectly:

- open of /dev/kmsg checks syslog access permissions by using
  check_syslog_permissions() where security_syslog() is not called if
  dmesg_restrict is set.

- syslog syscall and /proc/kmsg calls do_syslog() where security_syslog
  can be executed twice (inside check_syslog_permissions() and then
  directly in do_syslog())

With this patch security_syslog() is called once only in all
syslog-related operations regardless of dmesg_restrict value.
