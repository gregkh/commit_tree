ARM: dts: sunxi: Add address- and size-cells properties to the mmc ctrl nodes

Sometimes we need to specify non-probably information for sdio devices in the
devicetree, this is done through child nodes addressed by the reg property,
whereby the reg property refers to the sdio function number, see;
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt

This commit adds the necessary address- and size-cells properties to the mmc
controller nodes in the dtsi files, so that dts files needing such a child
node do not need to specify these themselves.
