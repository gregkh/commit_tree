dm raid1: keep issuing IO after leg failure

Currently if there is a leg failure, the bio will be put into the hold
list until userspace does a remove/replace on the leg.  Doing so in a
cluster config (clvmd) is problematic because there may be a temporary
path failure that results in cluster raid1 remove/replace.  Such
recovery takes a long time due to a full resync.

Update dm-raid1 to optionally ignore these failures so bios continue
being issued without interrupton.  To enable this feature userspace
must pass "keep_log" when creating the dm-raid1 device.
