powerpc: Fix duplicate const clang warning in user access code

We see a large number of duplicate const errors in the user access
code when building with llvm/clang:

  include/linux/pagemap.h:576:8: warning: duplicate 'const' declaration specifier
      [-Wduplicate-decl-specifier]
        ret = __get_user(c, uaddr);

The problem is we are doing const __typeof__(*(ptr)), which will hit the
warning if ptr is marked const.

Removing const does not seem to have any effect on GCC code generation.
