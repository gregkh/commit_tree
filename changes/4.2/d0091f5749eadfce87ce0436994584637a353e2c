HID: core: remove phidgets from ignore list

Once there were kernel drivers for some of the phidgets devices, and for
those kernel drivers to work the hid system needed exceptions. Now the
kernel drivers are long gone in favour of the user-space drivers.

The user-space drivers support many more phidget devices and uses libusb.
The udev rules set up permissions so that the kernel hid driver can be
unbound from libusb, as it does for many devices not in hid_ignore_list.
