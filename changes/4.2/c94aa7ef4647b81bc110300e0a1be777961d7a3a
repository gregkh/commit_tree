ath10k: fix survey reporting

Number of channels is stored in a separate macro
in a header file and channel list is constructed
independently. The macro is used to define survey
array.

This fixes a recent regression introduced after
adding support for 144 channel. The regression
would lead to a warning and incomplete survey data
on channel 165:

  chan info: invalid frequency 5825 (idx 38 out of bounds)

Also make sure to enforce the sizes and avoid this
kind of problem in the future.
