xfs: don't cast string literals

The commit:

a9273ca5 xfs: convert attr to use unsigned names

added these (unsigned char *) casts, but then the _SIZE macros
return "7" - size of a pointer minus one - not the length of
the string.  This is harmless in the kernel, because the _SIZE
macros are not used, but as we sync up with userspace, this will
matter.

I don't think the cast is necessary; i.e. assigning the string
literal to an unsigned char *, or passing it to a function
expecting an unsigned char *, should be ok, right?
