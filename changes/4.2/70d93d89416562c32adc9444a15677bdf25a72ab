arc:irqchip: prepare for drivers/irqchip/irqchip.h removal

The IRQCHIP_DECLARE macro migrated to 'include/linux/irqchip.h'.

See commit 91e20b5040c67c51aad88cf87db4305c5bd7f79d
("irqchip: Move IRQCHIP_DECLARE macro to include/linux/irqchip.h").

This patch removes the inclusions of private header 'drivers/irqchip/irqchip.h'
and if necessary replaces them with inclusions of 'include/linux/irqchip.h'.
