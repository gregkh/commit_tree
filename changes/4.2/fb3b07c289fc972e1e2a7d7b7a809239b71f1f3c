ALSA: hda - Merge codec and controller helpers

There is no much merit to keep the HD-audio codec and controller
helper codes in separate modules any longer.  Let's merge them into a
single helper module.

This patch just changes Makefile entries to merge two individual
modules to one.  The only code change is the removal of superfluous
MODULE_*() macros in one side.
