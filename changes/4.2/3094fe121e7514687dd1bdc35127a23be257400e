mtd: m25p80: remove unused flash entries from id_table

We had many entries that were recently added just to allow selecting
some flashes directly but were never used. They weren't providing any
special flash handling, we just needed them due to the lack of some
generic binding string.

With the introduction of "nor-jedec" (in 1103b85) they won't be needed
unless we discover some faulty flash requiring workarounds.
As explained in m25p80 DT documentation we require specifying
"nor-jedec" now as less specific compatible entry.
