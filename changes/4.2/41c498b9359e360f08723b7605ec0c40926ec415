bridge: restore br_setlink back to original

This is revert of:

commit 68e331c785b8 ("bridge: offload bridge port attributes to switch asic
if feature flag set")

Restore br_setlink back to original and don't call into SELF port driver.
rtnetlink.c:bridge_setlink() already does a call into port driver for SELF.

bridge set link cmd defaults to MASTER.  From man page for bridge link set
cmd:

       self   link setting is configured on specified physical device

       master link setting is configured on the software bridge (default)

The link setting has two values: the device-side value and the software
bridge-side value.  These are independent and settable using the bridge
link set cmd by specifying some combination of [master] | [self].
Furthermore, the device-side and bridge-side settings have their own
initial value, viewable from bridge -d link show cmd.

Restoring br_setlink back to original makes rocker (the only in-kernel user
of SELF link settings) work as first implement: two-sided values.

It's true that when both MASTER and SELF are specified from the command,
two netlink notifications are generated, one for each side of the settings.
The user-space app can distiquish between the two notifications by
observing the MASTER or SELF flag.
