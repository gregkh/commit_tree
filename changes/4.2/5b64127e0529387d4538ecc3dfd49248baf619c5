drivers/cpufreq: Convert non-modular s5pv210-cpufreq.c to use builtin_platform_driver

This file depends on a Kconfig option which is a bool, so
we use the appropriate registration function, which avoids us
relying on an implicit inclusion of <module.h> which we are
doing currently.

While this currently works, we really don't want to be including
the module.h header in non-modular code, which we'd be forced
to do, pending some upcoming code relocation from init.h into
module.h.  So we fix it now by using the non-modular equivalent.
