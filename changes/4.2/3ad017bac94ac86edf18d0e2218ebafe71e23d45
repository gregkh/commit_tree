tracing: Rename ftrace_event_type_funcs_##call to trace_event_type_funcs_##call

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The structure ftrace_event_type_funcs_##call
is used to define how the trace_events will be printed. It has nothing to
do with function tracing. Rename it.
