net/mlx4_en: Fix wrong csum complete report when rxvlan offload is disabled

The check_csum() function relied on hwtstamp_rx_filter to know if rxvlan
offload is disabled. This is wrong since rxvlan offload can be switched
on/off regardless of hwtstamp_rx_filter.

Also moved check_csum to query CQE information to identify VLAN packets
and removed the check of IP packets, since it has been validated before.
