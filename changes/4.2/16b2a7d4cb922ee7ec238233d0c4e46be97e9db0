ARM: dts: sun6i: Add a dts file for the Mele A1000G quad top set box

The Mele A1000G-quad and the Mele M9 have the same PCB, sofar we've been using
the same dts for both models. Unfortunately this does not work for the otg
controller, on the M9 this is routed to a micro-usb connector on the outside,
while as on the A1000G-quad it is connected to an usb to sata bridge
(which is not populated on the M9 pcb).

This commit adds a new dts for the Mele-A1000G-quad to allow using
different otg controller settings on the 2 boards.
