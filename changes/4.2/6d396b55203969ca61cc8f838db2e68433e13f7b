KVM: x86: advertise KVM_CAP_X86_SMM

... and we're done. :)

Because SMBASE is usually relocated above 1M on modern chipsets, and
SMM handlers might indeed rely on 4G segment limits, we only expose it
if KVM is able to run the guest in big real mode.  This includes any
of VMX+emulate_invalid_guest_state, VMX+unrestricted_guest, or SVM.
