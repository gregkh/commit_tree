net/mlx4: Add EQ pool

Previously, mlx4_en allocated EQs and used them exclusively.
This affected RoCE performance, as applications which are
events sensitive were limited to use only the legacy EQs.

Change that by introducing an EQ pool. This pool is managed
by mlx4_core. EQs are assigned to ports (when there are limited
number of EQs, multiple ports could be assigned to the same EQs).

An exception to this rule is the ASYNC EQ which handles various events.

Legacy EQs are completely removed as all EQs could be shared.

When a consumer (mlx4_ib/mlx4_en) requests an EQ, it asks for
EQ serving on a specific port. The core driver calculates which
EQ should be assigned to that request.

Because IRQs are shared between IB and Ethernet modules, their
names only include the PCI device BDF address.
