tick: broadcast-hrtimer: Remove overly clever return value abuse

The assignment of bc_moved in the conditional construct relies on the
fact that in the case of hrtimer_start() invocation the return value
is always 0. It took me a while to understand it.

We want to get rid of the hrtimer_start() return value. Open code the
logic which makes it readable as well.
