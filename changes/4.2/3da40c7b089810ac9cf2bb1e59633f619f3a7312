ext4: only call ext4_truncate when size <= isize

At LSF we decided that if we truncate up from isize we shouldn't trim
fallocated blocks that were fallocated with KEEP_SIZE and are past the
new i_size.  This patch fixes ext4 to do this.

[ Completely reworked patch so that i_disksize would actually get set
  when truncating up.  Also reworked the code for handling truncate so
  that it's easier to handle. -- tytso ]
