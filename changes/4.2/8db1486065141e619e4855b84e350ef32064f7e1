include, lib: add __printf attributes to several function prototypes

Using __printf attributes helps to detect several format string issues
at compile time (even though -Wformat-security is currently disabled in
Makefile).  For example it can detect when formatting a pointer as a
number, like the issue fixed in commit a3fa71c40f18 ("wl18xx: show
rx_frames_per_rates as an array as it really is"), or when the arguments
do not match the format string, c.f.  for example commit 5ce1aca81435
("reiserfs: fix __RASSERT format string").

To prevent similar bugs in the future, add a __printf attribute to every
function prototype which needs one in include/linux/ and lib/.  These
functions were mostly found by using gcc's -Wsuggest-attribute=format
flag.
