PM / Domains: Skip timings during syscore suspend/resume

The PM Domain code uses ktime_get() to perform various latency
measurements.  However, if ktime_get() is called while timekeeping is
suspended, the following warning is printed:

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1340 at kernel/time/timekeeping.c:576 ktime_get+0x3

This happens when resuming the PM Domain that contains the clock events
source, which calls pm_genpd_syscore_poweron(). Chain of operations is:

    timekeeping_resume()
    {
	clockevents_resume()
	    sh_cmt_clock_event_resume()
		pm_genpd_syscore_poweron()
		    pm_genpd_sync_poweron()
			genpd_syscore_switch()
			    genpd_power_on()
				ktime_get(), but timekeeping_suspended == 1
	...
	timekeeping_suspended = 0;
    }

Fix this by adding a "timed" parameter to genpd_power_{on,off}() and
pm_genpd_sync_power{off,on}(), to indicate whether latency measurements
are allowed.  This parameter is passed as false in
genpd_syscore_switch() (i.e. during syscore suspend/resume), and true in
all other cases.
