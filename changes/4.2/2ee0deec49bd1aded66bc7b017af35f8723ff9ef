staging: unisys: cleanup visorbus_private.h

visorbus_private.h contains code that is called from visorbus into the
visorchipset code.  Now that the visorchipset code has been brought into
the visorbus directory, many of the declarations are not necessary and
can be cleaned up.

TODO: PARSER_WHICH_STRING enum only has one member used
(PARSERSTRING_NAME).

TODO: crash_obj_type appears to be unnecessary in the overall scheme of
code.
