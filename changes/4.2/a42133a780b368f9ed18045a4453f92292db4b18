drm: omapdrm: Apply settings synchronously

The omapdrm driver implements a mechanism to apply new settings (due to
plane update, plane disable, plane property set, CRTC mode set or CRTC
DPMS) asynchronously. While this improves performance, it adds a level
of complexity that makes transition to the atomic update API close to
impossible. Furthermore the atomic update API requires part of the apply
operations to be synchronous (such as pinning the framebuffers), so the
current implementation needs to be changed.

Simplify the CRTC and plane code by making updates synchronous to
prepare for the switch to the atomic update API. Asynchronous update
will be implemented in a second step.
