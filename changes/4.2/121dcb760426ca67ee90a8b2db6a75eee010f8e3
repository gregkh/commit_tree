gpio: omap: rework omap_gpio_irq_startup to handle current pin state properly

The omap_gpio_irq_startup() can be called at time when:
- corresponding GPIO has been requested already and in this case
it has to be configured as input already. If not - return with -EINVAL
and do not try to re-configure it as it could be unsafe.
- corresponding GPIO is free: reconfigure GPIO as input.

In addition, call omap_enable_gpio_module directly as all needed
checks are already present inside it.
