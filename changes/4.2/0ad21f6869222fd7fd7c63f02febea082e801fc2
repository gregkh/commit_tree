perf tools: Add support for PERF_RECORD_ITRACE_START

Add support for the PERF_RECORD_ITRACE_START event type.  This event can
be used to determine the pid and tid that are running when Instruction
Tracing starts.  Generally that information would come from a
sched_switch event but, at the start, no sched_switch events may yet
have been recorded.
