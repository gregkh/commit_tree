GFS2: Don't add all glocks to the lru

The glocks used for resource groups often come and go hundreds of
thousands of times per second. Adding them to the lru list just
adds unnecessary contention for the lru_lock spin_lock, especially
considering we're almost certainly going to re-use the glock and
take it back off the lru microseconds later. We never want the
glock shrinker to cull them anyway. This patch adds a new bit in
the glops that determines which glock types get put onto the lru
list and which ones don't.
