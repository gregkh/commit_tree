extcon: Update the prototype of extcon_register_notifier() with enum extcon

Previously, extcon consumer driver used the extcon_register_interest()
to register the notifier chain and then to receive the notifier event
when external connector's state is changed. When registering the notifier chain
for specific external connector with extcon_register_interest(), it used the
the string name of external connector directly. There are potential problem
because of unclear, non-standard and inconsequent cable name. Namely,
it is not appropriate method to identify each external connector.

So, this patch modify the prototype of extcon_register_notifier() by using
the 'enum extcon' which are the unique id for each external connector
instead of unclear string method.

- Previously, the extcon consumer driver used the extcon_register_interest()
with 'cable_name' to point out the specific external connector. Also. it used
the un-needed structure (struct extcon_specific_cable_nb).
: int extcon_register_interest(struct extcon_specific_cable_nb *obj,
			     const char *extcon_name, const char *cable_name,
			     struct notifier_block *nb)

- Newly, the updated extcon_register_notifier() would definitely support
the same feature to detech the changed state of external connector without
any specific structure (struct extcon_specific_cable_nb).
: int extcon_register_notifier(struct extcon_dev *edev, enum extcon id,
			     struct notifier_block *nb)

This patch support the both extcon_register_interest() and new extcon_register_
notifier(). But the extcon_{register|unregister}_interest() will be deprecated
because extcon core would support the notifier event for extcon consumer driver
with only updated extcon_register_notifier() and 'extcon_specific_cable_nb'
will be removed if there are no extcon consumer driver with legacy
extcon_{register|unregister}_interest().
