zram: report every added and removed device

With dynamic device creation/removal (which will be introduced later in
the series) printing num_devices in zram_init() will not make a lot of
sense, as well as printing the number of destroyed devices in
destroy_devices().  Print per-device action (added/removed) in zram_add()
and zram_remove() instead.

Example:

[ 3645.259652] zram: Added device: zram5
[ 3646.152074] zram: Added device: zram6
[ 3650.585012] zram: Removed device: zram5
[ 3655.845584] zram: Added device: zram8
[ 3660.975223] zram: Removed device: zram6
