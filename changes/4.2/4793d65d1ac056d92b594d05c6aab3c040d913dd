vfio: powerpc/spapr: powerpc/powernv/ioda: Define and implement DMA windows API

This extends iommu_table_group_ops by a set of callbacks to support
dynamic DMA windows management.

create_table() creates a TCE table with specific parameters.
it receives iommu_table_group to know nodeid in order to allocate
TCE table memory closer to the PHB. The exact format of allocated
multi-level table might be also specific to the PHB model (not
the case now though).
This callback calculated the DMA window offset on a PCI bus from @num
and stores it in a just created table.

set_window() sets the window at specified TVT index + @num on PHB.

unset_window() unsets the window from specified TVT.

This adds a free() callback to iommu_table_ops to free the memory
(potentially a tree of tables) allocated for the TCE table.

create_table() and free() are supposed to be called once per
VFIO container and set_window()/unset_window() are supposed to be
called for every group in a container.

This adds IOMMU capabilities to iommu_table_group such as default
32bit window parameters and others. This makes use of new values in
vfio_iommu_spapr_tce. IODA1/P5IOC2 do not support DDW so they do not
advertise pagemasks to the userspace.
