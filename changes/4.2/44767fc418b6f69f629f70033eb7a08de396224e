[media] dw2102: TeVii S482 support

TeVii S482 is a PCIe device with two tuners that actually contains two
USB devices. The devices are visible in the lsusb printout.

Bus 006 Device 002: ID 9022:d483 TeVii Technology Ltd.
Bus 007 Device 002: ID 9022:d484 TeVii Technology Ltd.

The device itself works exactly with the same settings as TechnoTrend
TT-connect S2-4600. Firmware for DS3103 demodulator is required:
