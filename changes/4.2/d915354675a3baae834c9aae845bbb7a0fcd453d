ath10k: add ATH10K_FW_FEATURE_IGNORE_OTP_RESULT

qca6174 otp binary seems to always return an error to the host, even if the
calibration succeeded. Add a firmware feature flag to detect if the firmware
image which have this problem and workaround the issue in ath10k by ignoring
the error code.

I was also considering making this hw specific flag but as this is strictly a
firmware issue it's best to handle this via a firmware feature flag so that it
will be easy to disable the workaround.
