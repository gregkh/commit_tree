net/mlx4_core: Move affinity hints to mlx4_core ownership

Now that EQs management is in the sole responsibility of mlx4_core,
the IRQ affinity hints configuration should be in its hands as well.
request_irq is called only once by the first consumer (maybe mlx4_ib),
so mlx4_en passes the affinity mask too late. We also need to request
vectors according to the cores we want to run on.

mlx4_core distribution of IRQs to cores is straight forward,
EQ(i)->IRQ will set affinity hint to core i.
Consumers need to request EQ vectors, according to their cores
considerations (NUMA).
