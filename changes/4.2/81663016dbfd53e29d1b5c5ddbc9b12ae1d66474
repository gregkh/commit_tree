drm/amdkfd: Add module parameter of send_sigterm

This patch adds a new kernel module parameter to amdkfd,
called send_sigterm.

This parameter specifies whether amdkfd should send the
SIGTERM signal to an HSA process, when the following conditions
occur:

1. The GPU triggers an exception regarding a kernel that was
   issued by this process.

2. The HSA process isn't waiting on an event that handles
   this exception.

The default behavior is not to send a SIGTERM and suffice
with a dmesg error print.
