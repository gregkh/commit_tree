OMAPDSS: DISPC: do only y decimation on OMAP3

The current driver does both x and y decimation on OMAP3 DSS. Testing
shows that x decimation rarely works, leading to underflows.

The exact reason for this is unclear, as the underflows seem to happen
even with low pixel clock rates, and I would presume that if the DSS can
manage a display with 140MHz pixel clock, it could manage x decimation
with factor 2 with a low pixel clock (~30MHz).

So it is possible that there is a problem somewhere else, in memory
management, or DSS DMA, or similar. I have not found anything that would
help this.

So, to fix the downscaling scaling, this patch removes x decimation for
OMAP3. This will limit some of the more demanding downscaling scenarios,
but one could argue that using DSS to downscale such a large amount is
insane in the first place, as the produced image is rather bad quality.
