Revert "serial: imx: initialized DMA w/o HW flow enabled"

This reverts commit 068500e08dc87ea9a453cc4a500cf3ab28d0f936.

According to some tests, SDMA support is broken at least for i.MX6 without
HW flow control. Different forms of data-corruption appear either with
the ROM firmware for the SDMA controller as well as when loading Freescale
provided SDMA firmware versions 1.1 or 3.1.
