ALSA: bebob: expand timeout for DM1500 quirk

Behringer FCA610 and UFX1604 is confirmed to require more time till
transmitting packets after establishing connections. This seems to
be a quirk of DM1500 ASIC which ArchWave produced.

For this quirk, this commit extends the time to wait up to 2 seconds.
As a result, in worst cases, below userspace functions require 2 seconds
to return.
