KVM: remove pointless cpu hotplug messages

On cpu hotplug only KVM emits an unconditional message that its notifier
has been called. It certainly can be assumed that calling cpu hotplug
notifiers work, therefore there is no added value if KVM prints a message.

If an error happens on cpu online KVM will still emit a warning.

So let's remove this superfluous message.
