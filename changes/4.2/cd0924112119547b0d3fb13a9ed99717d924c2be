thp: cleanup how khugepaged enters freezer

khugepaged_do_scan() checks in every iteration whether freezing(current)
is true, and in such case breaks out of the loop, which causes
try_to_freeze() to be called immediately afterwards in
khugepaged_wait_work().

If nothing else, this causes unnecessary freezing(current) test, and also
makes the way khugepaged enters freezer a bit less obvious than necessary.

Let's just try to freeze directly, instead of splitting it into two
(directly adjacent) phases.
