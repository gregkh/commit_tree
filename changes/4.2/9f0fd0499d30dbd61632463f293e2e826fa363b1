powerpc/powernv: Add a virtual irqchip for opal events

Whenever an interrupt is received for opal the linux kernel gets a
bitfield indicating certain events that have occurred and need handling
by the various device drivers. Currently this is handled using a
notifier interface where we call every device driver that has
registered to receive opal events.

This approach has several drawbacks. For example each driver has to do
its own checking to see if the event is relevant as well as event
masking. There is also no easy method of recording the number of times
we receive particular events.

This patch solves these issues by exposing opal events via the
standard interrupt APIs by adding a new interrupt chip and
domain. Drivers can then register for the appropriate events using
standard kernel calls such as irq_of_parse_and_map().
