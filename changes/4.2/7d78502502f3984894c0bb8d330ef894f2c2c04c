ASoC: tas2552: Implement startup/stop sequence as per TRM

Certain sequence need to be followed in order to have smooth power up and
power down performance.
Execute this sequence via DAPM_POST widget.
Remove patching the RESERVED_0D register at probe time since it has to be
handled every time when we stop or start the amplifier.
In order to be able to execute the sequence at the correct time, the driver
need to request to ignore the pmdown time.
