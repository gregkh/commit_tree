MIPS: JZ4740: only detect RAM size if not specified in DT

Allow a devicetree to specify the memory present in the system rather
than probing it from the memory controller. This both saves the probing
for systems where the amount of memory is fixed, and will simplify the
bringup of later Ingenic SoCs where the memory controller register
layout differs.
