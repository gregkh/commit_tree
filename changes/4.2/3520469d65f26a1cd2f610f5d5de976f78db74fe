KVM: export __gfn_to_pfn_memslot, drop gfn_to_pfn_async

gfn_to_pfn_async is used in just one place, and because of x86-specific
treatment that place will need to look at the memory slot.  Hence inline
it into try_async_pf and export __gfn_to_pfn_memslot.

The patch also switches the subsequent call to gfn_to_pfn_prot to use
__gfn_to_pfn_memslot.  This is a small optimization.  Finally, remove
the now-unused async argument of __gfn_to_pfn.
