dax: bdev_direct_access() may sleep

The brd driver is the only in-tree driver that may sleep currently.
After some discussion on linux-fsdevel, we decided that any driver
may choose to sleep in its ->direct_access method.  To ensure that all
callers of bdev_direct_access() are prepared for this, add a call
to might_sleep().
