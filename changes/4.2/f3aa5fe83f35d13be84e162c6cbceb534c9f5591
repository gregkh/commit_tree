staging: unisys: Move the visorbus device underneath devices

Mimicing what other drivers do, this seems appropriate.  Yeah, it
is a bus, but it is a bus _device_.  This makes things work better
and smoother.  Now the sysfs looks like

[root@dhcp-17-174 visorbus]# ls -l /sys/bus/visorbus/devices/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 Apr 17 16:09 vbus1:dev2 ->
		../../../devices/visorbus1/vbus1:dev2
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 Apr 17 16:09 visorbus1 ->
		../../../devices/visorbus1

Which looks correct.  All the attributes are still correct too, based on my
very minimal testing of 'ls -lR'. :-)
