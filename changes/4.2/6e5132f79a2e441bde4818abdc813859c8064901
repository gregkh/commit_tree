ASoC: intel: Revert "ASoC: Intel: fix broadwell module removing failed issue"

This reverts commit 01f202c7b4b40025f3ea4721c52e7f78545e3b07.

We shouldn't leave the device as suspended state after module freed,
it is not good to do runtime suspend at driver free, here revert
this fixing, and replace it with the procedure:
suspends firmware ==> frees runtime modules ==> unloads firmware.
