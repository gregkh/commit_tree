perf tools: Disallow PMU events intel_pt and intel_bts until there is support

Disallow PMU events intel_pt and intel_bts until the tools support them.

By default any PMU is selectable as an event but until the tools have
intel_pt and intel_bts support using them would result in no data being
recorded without any indication as to why.

Before the change:

    $ perf record -e intel_bts// sleep 1
    [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
    [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.008 MB perf.data ]
    $ perf report --stdio
    Error:
    The perf.data file has no samples!

After the change:

    $ perf record -e intel_bts// sleep 1
    invalid or unsupported event: 'intel_bts//'
    Run 'perf list' for a list of valid events
