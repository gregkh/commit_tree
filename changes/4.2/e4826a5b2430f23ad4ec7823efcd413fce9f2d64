Btrfs: btrfs_defrag_file: Fix ra_index computation.

Read-ahead is done for the pages in the range [ra_index, ra_index + cluster -
1]. So the next read-ahead should be starting from the page at index 'ra_index
+ cluster' (unless we deemed that the extent at 'ra_index + cluster' as
non-defraggable) rather than from the page at index 'ra_index +
max_cluster'. This patch fixes this. I did run the xfstests suite to make sure
that the code does not regress.
