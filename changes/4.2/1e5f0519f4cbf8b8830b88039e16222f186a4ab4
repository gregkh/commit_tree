ARM: 8365/1: introduce sp804_timer_disable and remove arm_timer.h inclusion

The header asm/hardware/arm_timer.h is included in various machine
specific files to access TIMER_CTRL and initialise to a known state.

This patch introduces a new function sp804_timer_disable to disable
the SP804 timers and uses the same for initialising the timers to
known(off) state, thereby removing the dependency on the header
asm/hardware/arm_timer.h

This change is in prepartion to move sp804 timer support out of arch/arm
so that it can be used on ARM64 platforms.
