ext4: BUG_ON assertion repeated for inode1, not done for inode2

During a source code review of fs/ext4/extents.c I noted identical
consecutive lines. An assertion is repeated for inode1 and never done
for inode2. This is not in keeping with the rest of the code in the
ext4_swap_extents function and appears to be a bug.

Assert that the inode2 mutex is not locked.
