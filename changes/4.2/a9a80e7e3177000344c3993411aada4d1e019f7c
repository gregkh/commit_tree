PM / OPP: Allow multiple OPP tables to be passed via DT

On some platforms (Like Qualcomm's SoCs), it is not decided until
runtime on what OPPs to use. The OPP tables can be fixed at compile
time, but which table to use is found out only after reading some efuses
(sort of an prom) and knowing characteristics of the SoC.

To support such platform we need to pass multiple OPP tables per device
and hardware should be able to choose one and only one table out of
those.

Update operating-points-v2 bindings to support that.
