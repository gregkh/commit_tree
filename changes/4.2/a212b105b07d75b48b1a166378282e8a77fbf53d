bdi: make inode_to_bdi() inline

Now that bdi definitions are moved to backing-dev-defs.h,
backing-dev.h can include blkdev.h and inline inode_to_bdi() without
worrying about introducing circular include dependency.  The function
gets called from hot paths and fairly trivial.

This patch makes inode_to_bdi() and sb_is_blkdev_sb() that the
function calls inline.  blockdev_superblock and noop_backing_dev_info
are EXPORT_GPL'd to allow the inline functions to be used from
modules.

While at it, make sb_is_blkdev_sb() return bool instead of int.

v2: Fixed typo in description as suggested by Jan.
