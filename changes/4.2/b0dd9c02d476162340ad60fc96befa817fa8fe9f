arm64: Rework alternate sequence for ARM erratum 845719

The workaround for erratum 845719 is currently using
a branch between two alternate sequences, which is
quite fragile, and that we are going to break as we
rework the alternative code.

This patch reworks the workaround to fit in a single
alternative sequence. The generated code itself is
unchanged.
