switchdev: convert STP update to switchdev attr set

STP update is just a settable port attribute, so convert
switchdev_port_stp_update to an attr set.

For DSA, the prepare phase is skipped and STP updates are only done in the
commit phase.  This is because currently the DSA drivers don't need to
allocate any memory for STP updates and the STP update will not fail to HW
(unless something horrible goes wrong on the MDIO bus, in which case the
prepare phase wouldn't have been able to predict anyway).
