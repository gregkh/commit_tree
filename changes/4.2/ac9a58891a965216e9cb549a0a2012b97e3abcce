powerpc/iommu: Put IOMMU group explicitly

So far an iommu_table lifetime was the same as PE. Dynamic DMA windows
will change this and iommu_free_table() will not always require
the group to be released.

This moves iommu_group_put() out of iommu_free_table().

This adds a iommu_pseries_free_table() helper which does
iommu_group_put() and iommu_free_table(). Later it will be
changed to receive a table_group and we will have to change less
lines then.

This should cause no behavioural change.
