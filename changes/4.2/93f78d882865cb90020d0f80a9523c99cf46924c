writeback: move backing_dev_info->bdi_stat[] into bdi_writeback

Currently, a bdi (backing_dev_info) embeds single wb (bdi_writeback)
and the role of the separation is unclear.  For cgroup support for
writeback IOs, a bdi will be updated to host multiple wb's where each
wb serves writeback IOs of a different cgroup on the bdi.  To achieve
that, a wb should carry all states necessary for servicing writeback
IOs for a cgroup independently.

This patch moves bdi->bdi_stat[] into wb.

* enum bdi_stat_item is renamed to wb_stat_item and the prefix of all
  enums is changed from BDI_ to WB_.

* BDI_STAT_BATCH() -> WB_STAT_BATCH()

* [__]{add|inc|dec|sum}_wb_stat(bdi, ...) -> [__]{add|inc}_wb_stat(wb, ...)

* bdi_stat[_error]() -> wb_stat[_error]()

* bdi_writeout_inc() -> wb_writeout_inc()

* stat init is moved to bdi_wb_init() and bdi_wb_exit() is added and
  frees stat.

* As there's still only one bdi_writeback per backing_dev_info, all
  uses of bdi->stat[] are mechanically replaced with bdi->wb.stat[]
  introducing no behavior changes.
