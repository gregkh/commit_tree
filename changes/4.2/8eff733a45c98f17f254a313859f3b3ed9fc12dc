link_path_walk: end of nd->depth massage

get rid of orig_depth - we only use it on error exit to tell whether
to stop doing put_link() when depth reaches 0 (call from path_init())
or when it reaches 1 (call from trailing_symlink()).  However, in
the latter case the caller would immediately follow with one more
put_link().  Just keep doing it until the depth reaches zero (and
simplify trailing_symlink() as the result).
