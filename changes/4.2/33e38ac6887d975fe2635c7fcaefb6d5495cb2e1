md-cluster: fix bitmap sub-offset in bitmap_read_sb

bitmap_read_sb is modifying mddev->bitmap_info.offset. This works for
the first bitmap read. However, when multiple bitmaps need to be opened
by the same node, it ends up corrupting the offset. Fix it by using a
local variable.

Also, bitmap_read_sb is not required in bitmap_copy_from_slot since
it is called in bitmap_create. Remove bitmap_read_sb().
