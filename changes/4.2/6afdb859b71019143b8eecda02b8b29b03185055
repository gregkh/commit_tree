mm: do not ignore mapping_gfp_mask in page cache allocation paths

page_cache_read, do_generic_file_read, __generic_file_splice_read and
__ntfs_grab_cache_pages currently ignore mapping_gfp_mask when calling
add_to_page_cache_lru which might cause recursion into fs down in the
direct reclaim path if the mapping really relies on GFP_NOFS semantic.

This doesn't seem to be the case now because page_cache_read (page fault
path) doesn't seem to suffer from the reclaim recursion issues and
do_generic_file_read and __generic_file_splice_read also shouldn't be
called under fs locks which would deadlock in the reclaim path.  Anyway it
is better to obey mapping gfp mask and prevent from later breakage.
