f2fs: make posix_acl_create() safer and cleaner

Our f2fs_acl_create is copied from posix_acl_create in ./fs/posix_acl.c and
modified to avoid deadlock bug when inline_dentry feature is enabled.

Dan Carpenter rewrites posix_acl_create in commit 2799563b281f
("fs/posix_acl.c: make posix_acl_create() safer and cleaner") to make this
function more safer, so that we can avoid potential bug in its caller,
especially for ocfs2.

Let's back port the patch to f2fs.
