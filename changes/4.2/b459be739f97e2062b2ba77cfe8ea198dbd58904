crush: sync up with userspace

.. up to ceph.git commit 1db1abc8328d ("crush: eliminate ad hoc diff
between kernel and userspace").  This fixes a bunch of recently pulled
coding style issues and makes includes a bit cleaner.

A patch "crush:Make the function crush_ln static" from Nicholas Krause
<xerofoify@gmail.com> is folded in as crush_ln() has been made static
in userspace as well.
