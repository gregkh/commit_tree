writeback: implement and use inode_congested()

In several places, bdi_congested() and its wrappers are used to
determine whether more IOs should be issued.  With cgroup writeback
support, this question can't be answered solely based on the bdi
(backing_dev_info).  It's dependent on whether the filesystem and bdi
support cgroup writeback and the blkcg the inode is associated with.

This patch implements inode_congested() and its wrappers which take
@inode and determines the congestion state considering cgroup
writeback.  The new functions replace bdi_*congested() calls in places
where the query is about specific inode and task.

There are several filesystem users which also fit this criteria but
they should be updated when each filesystem implements cgroup
writeback support.

v2: Now that a given inode is associated with only one wb, congestion
    state can be determined independent from the asking task.  Drop
    @task.  Spotted by Vivek.  Also, converted to take @inode instead
    of @mapping and renamed to inode_congested().
