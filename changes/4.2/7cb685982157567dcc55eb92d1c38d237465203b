x86/smp/boot: Fix legacy SMP bootup slow-boot bug

So while testing kernels using tools/kvm/ (kvmtool) I noticed that it
booted super slow:

[    0.142991] Performance Events: no PMU driver, software events only.
[    0.149265] x86: Booting SMP configuration:
[    0.149765] .... node  #0, CPUs:          #1

[   30.177000]    #4
[   30.177000] kvm-stealtime: cpu 3, msr 211acd400

One CPU booted up per 10 seconds. With 120 CPUs that takes a while.

Bisection pinpointed this commit:

  853b160aaafb ("Revert f5d6a52f5111 ("x86/smpboot: Skip delays during SMP initialization similar to Xen")")

But that commit just restores previous behavior, so it cannot cause the
problem. After some head scratching it turns out that these two commits:

  1a744cb356c5 ("x86/smp/boot: Remove 10ms delay from cpu_up() on modern processors")
  d68921f9bd14 ("x86/smp/boot: Add cmdline "cpu_init_udelay=N" to specify cpu_up() delay")

added the following code to smpboot.c:

-               mdelay(10);
+               mdelay(init_udelay);

Note the mismatch in the units: the delay is called 'udelay' and is set
to microseconds - while the function used here is actually 'mdelay',
which counts in milliseconds ...

So the delay for legacy systems is off by a factor of 1,000, so instead
of 10 msecs we waited for 10 seconds ...

The reason bisection pointed to 853b160aaafb was that 853b160aaafb removed
a (broken) boot-time speedup patch, which masked the factor 1,000 bug.

Fix it by using udelay(). This fixes my bootup problems.
