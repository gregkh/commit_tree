ath10k: fix interpretation of cooling device state

Setting the sysfs attribute ends up configuring the duty cycle,
but the interface through which the attribute is exposed
(cooling_device) is for setting the throttle/cooling state. This
is confusing the user. Hence renaming the cooling device interfaces
for better readability.
