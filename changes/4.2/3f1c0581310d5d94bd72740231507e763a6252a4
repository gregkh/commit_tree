ipr: Fix invalid array indexing for HRRQ

Fixes another signed / unsigned array indexing bug in the ipr driver.
Currently, when hrrq_index wraps, it becomes a negative number. We
do the modulo, but still have a negative number, so we end up indexing
backwards in the array. Given where the hrrq array is located in memory,
we probably won't actually reference memory we don't own, but nonetheless
ipr is still looking at data within struct ipr_ioa_cfg and interpreting it as
struct ipr_hrr_queue data, so bad things could certainly happen.

Each ipr adapter has anywhere from 1 to 16 HRRQs. By default, we use 2 on new
adapters.  Let's take an example:

Assume ioa_cfg->hrrq_index=0x7fffffffe and ioa_cfg->hrrq_num=4:

The atomic_add_return will then return -1. We mod this with 3 and get -2, add
one and get -1 for an array index.

On adapters which support more than a single HRRQ, we dedicate HRRQ to adapter
initialization and error interrupts so that we can optimize the other queues
for fast path I/O. So all normal I/O uses HRRQ 1-15. So we want to spread the
I/O requests across those HRRQs.

With the default module parameter settings, this bug won't hit, only when
someone sets the ipr.number_of_msix parameter to a value larger than 3 is when
bad things start to happen.
