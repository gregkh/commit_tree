mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: enable interrupt mode to detect card

Enable interrupt mode to detect card instead of polling mode
for P1020/P4080/P5020/P5040/T1040 by removing the quirk
SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION. This could improve data
transferring performance and avoid the call trace caused by
polling card status sometime.
