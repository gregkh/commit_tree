net: fix sk_mem_reclaim_partial()

sk_mem_reclaim_partial() goal is to ensure each socket has
one SK_MEM_QUANTUM forward allocation. This is needed both for
performance and better handling of memory pressure situations in
follow up patches.

SK_MEM_QUANTUM is currently a page, but might be reduced to 4096 bytes
as some arches have 64KB pages.
