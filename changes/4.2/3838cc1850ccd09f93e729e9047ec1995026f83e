rcutorture: Allow negative values of nreaders to oversubscribe

By default, with rcutorture.nreaders equal to -1, rcutorture provisions
N-1 reader kthreads, where N is the number of CPUs.  This avoids
rcutorture-induced stalls, but also avoids heavier levels of torture.
This commit therefore allows negative values of rcutorture.nreaders
to specify larger numbers of reader kthreads, so that for example
rcutorture.nreaders=-2 provisions N kthreads and rcutorture.nreaders=-5
provisions N+3 kthreads.
