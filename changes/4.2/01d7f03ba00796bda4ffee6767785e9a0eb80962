megaraid_sas : fix megasas_fire_cmd_fusion calling convention

The fusion HBAs don't really use the instance template like the other
variants, as it branches off at a much higher level.  So instead of
trying to squeeze megasas_fire_cmd_fusion into the wrong calling
convention call it locally with argument data types that match what
is passed.
