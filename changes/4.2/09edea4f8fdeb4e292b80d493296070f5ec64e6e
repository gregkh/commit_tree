ARM: 8410/1: VDSO: fix coarse clock monotonicity regression

Since 906c55579a63 ("timekeeping: Copy the shadow-timekeeper over the
real timekeeper last") it has become possible on ARM to:

- Obtain a CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE or CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE timestamp
  via syscall.
- Subsequently obtain a timestamp for the same clock ID via VDSO which
  predates the first timestamp (by one jiffy).

This is because ARM's update_vsyscall is deriving the coarse time
using the __current_kernel_time interface, when it should really be
using the timekeeper object provided to it by the timekeeping core.
It happened to work before only because __current_kernel_time would
access the same timekeeper object which had been passed to
update_vsyscall.  This is no longer the case.
