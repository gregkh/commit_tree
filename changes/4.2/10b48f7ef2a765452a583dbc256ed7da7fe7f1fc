arm64: insn: Add aarch64_{get,set}_branch_offset

In order to deal with branches located in alternate sequences,
but pointing to the main kernel text, it is required to extract
the relative displacement encoded in the instruction, and to be
able to update said instruction with a new offset (once it is
known).

For this, we introduce three new helpers:
- aarch64_insn_is_branch_imm is a predicate indicating if the
  instruction is an immediate branch
- aarch64_get_branch_offset returns a signed value representing
  the byte offset encoded in a branch instruction
- aarch64_set_branch_offset takes an instruction and an offset,
  and returns the corresponding updated instruction.
