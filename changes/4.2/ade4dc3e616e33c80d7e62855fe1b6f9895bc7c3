bna: fix interrupts storm caused by erroneous packets

The commit "e29aa33 bna: Enable Multi Buffer RX" moved packets counter
increment from the beginning of the NAPI processing loop after the check
for erroneous packets so they are never accounted. This counter is used
to inform firmware about number of processed completions (packets).
As these packets are never acked the firmware fires IRQs for them again
and again.
