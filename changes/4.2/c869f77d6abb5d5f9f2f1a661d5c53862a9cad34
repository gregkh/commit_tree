add mt7601u driver

Add support for the simplest of MediaTek Wi-Fi devices - MT7601U.
It is a single stream bgn chip with no bells or whistles.
This driver is partially based on Felix's mt76 but IMHO it doesn't
make sense to merge the two right now because MT7601U is a design
somewhere between old Ralink devices and new Mediatek chips.  There
wouldn't be all that much code sharing with the devices mt76 supports.
Situation may obviously change when someone decides to extend m76 with
support for the more recent USB dongles.

The driver supports only station mode.  I'm hoping to add AP support
when time allows.

This driver sat on GitHub for quite a while and got some testing there:
