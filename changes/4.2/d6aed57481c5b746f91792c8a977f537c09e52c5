drm: rcar-du: Fix crash with groups that have less than 9 planes

Commit 917de180379d ("drm: rcar-du: Implement universal plane support")
made the number of planes per group dynamic, but didn't update all loops
over the planes array, resulting in out-of-bound accesses on DU
instances that have an odd number of CRTCs (such as the R8A7790). Fix
it.
