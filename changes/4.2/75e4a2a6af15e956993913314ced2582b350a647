perf probe: Load map before glob matching

Commit 4c859351226c920b227fec040a3b447f0d482af3 ("perf probe: Support
glob wildcards for function name") introduces a problem:

  # /root/perf probe kmem_cache_free
 Failed to find symbol kmem_cache_free in kernel
   Error: Failed to add events.

The reason is the replacement of map__for_each_symbol_by_name() (by
map__for_each_symbol()). Although their names are similar,
map__for_each_symbol doesn't call map__load() and dso__sort_by_name()
before searching. The missing of map__load() causes this problem because
it search symbol before load dso map.

This patch ensures map__load() is called before using
map__for_each_symbol().

After this patch:

 # /root/perf probe kmem_cache_free
  Added new event:
    probe:kmem_cache_free (on kmem_cache_free%return)

You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

        perf record -e probe:kmem_cache_free -aR sleep 1
