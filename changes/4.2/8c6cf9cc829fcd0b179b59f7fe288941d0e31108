mnt: Modify fs_fully_visible to deal with locked ro nodev and atime

Ignore an existing mount if the locked readonly, nodev or atime
attributes are less permissive than the desired attributes
of the new mount.

On success ensure the new mount locks all of the same readonly, nodev and
atime attributes as the old mount.

The nosuid and noexec attributes are not checked here as this change
is destined for stable and enforcing those attributes causes a
regression in lxc and libvirt-lxc where those applications will not
start and there are no known executables on sysfs or proc and no known
way to create exectuables without code modifications
