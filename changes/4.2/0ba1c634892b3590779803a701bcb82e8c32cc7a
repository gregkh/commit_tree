libnvdimm: write blk label set

After 'uuid', 'size', 'sector_size', and optionally 'alt_name' have been
set to valid values the labels on the dimm can be updated.  The
difference with the pmem case is that blk namespaces are limited to one
dimm and can cover discontiguous ranges in dpa space.

Also, after allocating label slots, it is useful for userspace to know
how many slots are left.  Export this information in sysfs.
