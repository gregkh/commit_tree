bdi: separate out congested state into a separate struct

Currently, a wb's (bdi_writeback) congestion state is carried in its
->state field; however, cgroup writeback support will require multiple
wb's sharing the same congestion state.  This patch separates out
congestion state into its own struct - struct bdi_writeback_congested.
A new field wb field, wb_congested, points to its associated congested
struct.  The default wb, bdi->wb, always points to bdi->wb_congested.

While this patch adds a layer of indirection, it doesn't introduce any
behavior changes.
