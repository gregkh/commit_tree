spi: spi-pxa2xx: remove legacy PXA DMA bits

Generic DMA support was already implemented by commit cd7bed003404
("spi/pxa2xx: break out the private DMA API usage into a separate file")
which moved all the legacy PXA DMA implementation code into its own
file.

With generic DMA available for PXA, we can now just trash this file.
