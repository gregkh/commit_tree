ARM: 8387/1: arm/mm/dma-mapping.c: Add arm_coherent_dma_mmap

When dma-coherent transfers are enabled, the mmap call must
not change the pg_prot flags in the vma struct.

Split the arm_dma_mmap into a common and specific parts,
and add a "arm_coherent_dma_mmap" implementation that does
not alter the page protection flags.

Tested on a topic-miami board (Zynq) using the ACP port
to transfer data between FPGA and CPU using the Dyplo
framework. Without this patch, byte-wise access to mmapped
coherent DMA memory was about 20x slower because of the
memory being marked as non-cacheable, and transfer speeds
would not exceed 240MB/s.

After this patch, the mapped memory is cacheable and the
transfer speed is again 600MB/s (limited by the FPGA) when
the data is in the L2 cache, while data integrity is being
maintained.

The patch has no effect on non-coherent DMA.
