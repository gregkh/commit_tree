net/phy: tune get_phy_c45_ids to support more c45 phy

As some C45 10G PHYs(e.g. Cortina CS4315/CS4340 PHY) have
zero Devices In package, current driver can't get correct
devices_in_package value by non-zero Devices In package.
so let's probe more with zero Devices In package to support
more C45 PHYs.
