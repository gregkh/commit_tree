rbd: use GFP_NOIO in rbd_obj_request_create()

rbd_obj_request_create() is called on the main I/O path, so we need to
use GFP_NOIO to make sure allocation doesn't blow back on us.  Not all
callers need this, but I'm still hardcoding the flag inside rather than
making it a parameter because a) this is going to stable, and b) those
callers shouldn't really use rbd_obj_request_create() and will be fixed
in the future.

More memory allocation fixes will follow.
