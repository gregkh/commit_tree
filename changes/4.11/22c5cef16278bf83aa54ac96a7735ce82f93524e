mm/zsmalloc: remove redundant SetPagePrivate2 in create_page_chain

We had used page->lru to link the component pages (except the first
page) of a zspage, and used INIT_LIST_HEAD(&page->lru) to init it.
Therefore, to get the last page's next page, which is NULL, we had to
use page flag PG_Private_2 to identify it.

But now, we use page->freelist to link all of the pages in zspage and
init the page->freelist as NULL for last page, so no need to use
PG_Private_2 anymore.

This remove redundant SetPagePrivate2 in create_page_chain and
ClearPagePrivate2 in reset_page().  Save a few cycles for migration of
zsmalloc page :)
