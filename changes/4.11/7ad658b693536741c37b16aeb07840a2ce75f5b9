KVM: nVMX: fix nested EPT detection

The nested_ept_enabled flag introduced in commit 7ca29de2136 was not
computed correctly. We are interested only in L1's EPT state, not the
the combined L0+L1 value.

In particular, if L0 uses EPT but L1 does not, nested_ept_enabled must
be false to make sure that PDPSTRs are loaded based on CR3 as usual,
because the special case described in 26.3.2.4 Loading Page-Directory-
Pointer-Table Entries does not apply.

Fixes: 7ca29de21362 ("KVM: nVMX: fix CR3 load if L2 uses PAE paging and EPT")
