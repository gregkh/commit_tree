GFS2: Made logd daemon take into account log demand

Before this patch, the logd daemon only tried to flush things when
the log blocks pinned exceeded a certain threshold. But when we're
deleting very large files, it may require a huge number of journal
blocks, and that, in turn, may exceed the threshold. This patch
factors that into account.
