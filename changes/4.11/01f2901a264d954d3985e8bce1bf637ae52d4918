ahci: qoriq: report error when ecc register address is missing in dts

For ls1021a, and armv8 chasis 2 socs, sata ecc must be disabled.
If ecc register is not found in sata node in dts, report error.

This is a chip erratum described as bellow:
The Read DMA operations get early termination indication from the
controller. This issue is observed as CRC error in the status registers.
The issue is due to address collision at address 0 in the dual port
memory. The read is a dummy read to flush out the header, but due to
collision the controller logs the mbit error reported by the ECC check
logic. This results in the early termination of the Read DMA operation
by the controller. The issue happens to all the interface
speeds(GEN1/2/3) for all the products.

Workaround:
Disable ECC feature on those platforms.
