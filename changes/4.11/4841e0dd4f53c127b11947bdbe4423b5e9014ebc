KVM: MIPS: Update vcpu->mode and vcpu->cpu

Keep the vcpu->mode and vcpu->cpu variables up to date so that
kvm_make_all_cpus_request() has a chance of functioning correctly. This
will soon need to be used for kvm_flush_remote_tlbs().

We can easily update vcpu->cpu when the VCPU context is loaded or saved,
which will happen when accessing guest context and when the guest is
scheduled in and out.

We need to be a little careful with vcpu->mode though, as we will in
future be checking for outstanding VCPU requests, and this must be done
after the value of IN_GUEST_MODE in vcpu->mode is visible to other CPUs.
Otherwise the other CPU could fail to trigger an IPI to wait for
completion dispite the VCPU request not being seen.
