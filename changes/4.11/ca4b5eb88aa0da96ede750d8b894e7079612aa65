cxgb4: Remove redundant memset before memcpy

The region set by the call to memset, immediately overwritten by
the subsequent call to memcpy and thus makes the  memset redundant.

Also remove the memset((&info, 0, sizeof(info)) on line 398 because
info is memcpy()'ed to before being used in the loop and it isn't
used outside of the loop.
