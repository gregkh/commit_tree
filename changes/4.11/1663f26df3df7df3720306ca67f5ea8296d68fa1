slub: make sysfs directories for memcg sub-caches optional

SLUB creates a per-cache directory under /sys/kernel/slab which hosts a
bunch of debug files.  Usually, there aren't that many caches on a
system and this doesn't really matter; however, if memcg is in use, each
cache can have per-cgroup sub-caches.  SLUB creates the same directories
for these sub-caches under /sys/kernel/slab/$CACHE/cgroup.

Unfortunately, because there can be a lot of cgroups, active or
draining, the product of the numbers of caches, cgroups and files in
each directory can reach a very high number - hundreds of thousands is
commonplace.  Millions and beyond aren't difficult to reach either.

What's under /sys/kernel/slab is primarily for debugging and the
information and control on the a root cache already cover its
sub-caches.  While having a separate directory for each sub-cache can be
helpful for development, it doesn't make much sense to pay this amount
of overhead by default.

This patch introduces a boot parameter slub_memcg_sysfs which determines
whether to create sysfs directories for per-memcg sub-caches.  It also
adds CONFIG_SLUB_MEMCG_SYSFS_ON which determines the boot parameter's
default value and defaults to 0.
