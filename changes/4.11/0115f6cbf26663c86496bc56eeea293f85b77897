MIPS: Flush wrong invalid FTLB entry for huge page

On VTLB+FTLB platforms (such as Loongson-3A R2), FTLB's pagesize is
usually configured the same as PAGE_SIZE. In such a case, Huge page
entry is not suitable to write in FTLB.

Unfortunately, when a huge page is created, its page table entries
haven't created immediately. Then the TLB refill handler will fetch an
invalid page table entry which has no "HUGE" bit, and this entry may be
written to FTLB. Since it is invalid, TLB load/store handler will then
use tlbwi to write the valid entry at the same place. However, the
valid entry is a huge page entry which isn't suitable for FTLB.

Our solution is to modify build_huge_handler_tail. Flush the invalid
old entry (whether it is in FTLB or VTLB, this is in order to reduce
branches) and use tlbwr to write the valid new entry.
