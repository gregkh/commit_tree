ACPI: Generic GSI: Do not attempt to map non-GSI IRQs during bus scan

ACPI extended IRQ resources may contain a Resource Source field to specify
an alternate interrupt controller, attempting to map them as GSIs is
incorrect, so just disable the platform resource.

Since this field is currently ignored, we make this change conditional
on CONFIG_ACPI_GENERIC_GSI to keep the current behavior on x86 platforms,
in case some existing ACPI tables are using this incorrectly.
