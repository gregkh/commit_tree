bnxt_en: Do not setup PHY unless driving a single PF.

If it is a VF or an NPAR function, the firmware call to setup the PHY
will fail.  Adding this check will prevent unnecessary firmware calls
to setup the PHY unless calling from the PF.  This will also eliminate
many unnecessary warning messages when the call from a VF or NPAR fails.
