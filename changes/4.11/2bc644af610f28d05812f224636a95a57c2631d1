ASoC: soc-core: remove OF adjusting for snd_soc_of_parse_audio_routing

Because prototype of OF-graph sound card support didn't have Sound Card
node, commit 7364c8dc255232db33bcd1c5b19eb8f34cf6108a
("ASoC: soc-core: adjust for graph on snd_soc_of_parse_audio_routing")
adjusted to it on each functions.

But final discussion result of ALSA SoC / OF-graph ML, OF-graph sound
card has node. Thus, this commit became no longer needed.

This reverts commit 7364c8dc255232db33bcd1c5b19eb8f34cf6108a.
