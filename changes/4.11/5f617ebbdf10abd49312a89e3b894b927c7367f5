cgroup: reorder css_set fields

Reorder css_set fields so that they're roughly in the order of how hot
they are.  The rough order is

1. the actual csses
2. reference counter and the default cgroup pointer.
3. task lists and iterations
4. fields used during merge including css_set lookup
5. the rest
