clk: sunxi-ng: fix recalc_rate formula of NKMP clocks

In commit e66f81bbd746 ("clk: sunxi-ng: Implement factors offsets"), the
final formula of NKMP clocks' recalc_rate is refactored; however, the
refactored formula broke the calculation due to some C language operand
priority problem -- the priority of operand >> is lower than * and /,
makes the formula being parsed as "(parent_rate * n * k) >> (p / m)", but
it should be "(parent_rate * n * k >> p) / m".

Add the pair of parentheses to fix up this issue. This pair of
parentheses used to exist in the old formula.
