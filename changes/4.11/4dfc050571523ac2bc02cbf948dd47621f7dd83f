KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Don't pretend to support IRQ/FIQ bypass

Our GICv3 emulation always presents ICC_SRE_EL1 with DIB/DFB set to
zero, which implies that there is a way to bypass the GIC and
inject raw IRQ/FIQ by driving the CPU pins.

Of course, we don't allow that when the GIC is configured, but
we fail to indicate that to the guest. The obvious fix is to
set these bits (and never let them being changed again).
