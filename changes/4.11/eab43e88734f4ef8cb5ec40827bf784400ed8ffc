arm64: cpufeature: Cleanup feature bit tables

This patch does the following clean ups :

1) All undescribed fields of a register are now treated as 'strict'
   with a safe value of 0. Hence we could leave an empty table for
   describing registers which are RAZ.

2) ID_AA64DFR1_EL1 is RAZ and should use the table for RAZ register.

3) ftr_generic32 is used to represent a register with a 32bit feature
   value. Rename this to ftr_singl32 to make it more obvious. Since
   we don't have a 64bit singe feature register, kill ftr_generic.

Based on a patch by Mark Rutland.
