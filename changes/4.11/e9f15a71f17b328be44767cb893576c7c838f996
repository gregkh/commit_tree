usb: chipidea: msm: Add proper clk and reset support

The msm chipidea controller uses two main clks, an AHB clk to
read/write the MMIO registers and a core clk called the system
clk that drives the controller itself. Add support for these clks
as they're required in all designs.

Also add support for an optional third clk that we need to turn
on to reset the controller and wrapper logic and other
"housekeeping" things. This clk was removed in later revisions of
the hardware because the reset methodology no longer required
clks to be enabled to propagate resets.
