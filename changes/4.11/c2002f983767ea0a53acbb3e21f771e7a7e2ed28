bpf: fix checking xdp_adjust_head on tail calls

Commit 17bedab27231 ("bpf: xdp: Allow head adjustment in XDP prog")
added the xdp_adjust_head bit to the BPF prog in order to tell drivers
that the program that is to be attached requires support for the XDP
bpf_xdp_adjust_head() helper such that drivers not supporting this
helper can reject the program. There are also drivers that do support
the helper, but need to check for xdp_adjust_head bit in order to move
packet metadata prepended by the firmware away for making headroom.

For these cases, the current check for xdp_adjust_head bit is insufficient
since there can be cases where the program itself does not use the
bpf_xdp_adjust_head() helper, but tail calls into another program that
uses bpf_xdp_adjust_head(). As such, the xdp_adjust_head bit is still
set to 0. Since the first program has no control over which program it
calls into, we need to assume that bpf_xdp_adjust_head() helper is used
upon tail calls. Thus, for the very same reasons in cb_access, set the
xdp_adjust_head bit to 1 when the main program uses tail calls.
