bpf: enable load bytes helper for filter/reuseport progs

BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER are used in various facilities such as
for SO_REUSEPORT and packet fanout demuxing, packet filtering, kcm,
etc, and yet the only facility they can use is BPF_LD with {BPF_ABS,
BPF_IND} for single byte/half/word access.

Direct packet access is only restricted to tc programs right now,
but we can still facilitate usage by allowing skb_load_bytes() helper
added back then in 05c74e5e53f6 ("bpf: add bpf_skb_load_bytes helper")
that calls skb_header_pointer() similarly to bpf_load_pointer(), but
for stack buffers with larger access size.

Name the previous sk_filter_func_proto() as bpf_base_func_proto()
since this is used everywhere else as well, similarly for the ctx
converter, that is, bpf_convert_ctx_access().
