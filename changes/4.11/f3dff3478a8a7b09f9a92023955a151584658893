arm64: allwinner: a64: Add MMC nodes

The A64 has 3 MMC controllers, one of them being especially targeted to
eMMC. Among other things, it has a data strobe signal and a 8 bits data
width.

The two other are more usual controllers that will have a 4 bits width at
most and no data strobe signal, which limits it to more usual SD or MMC
peripherals.
