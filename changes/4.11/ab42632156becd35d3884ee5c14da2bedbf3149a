module: set __jump_table alignment to 8

For powerpc the __jump_table section in modules is not aligned, this
causes a WARN_ON() splat when loading a module containing a __jump_table.

Strict alignment became necessary with commit 3821fd35b58d
("jump_label: Reduce the size of struct static_key"), currently in
linux-next, which uses the two least significant bits of pointers to
__jump_table elements.

Fix by forcing __jump_table to 8, which is the same alignment used for
this section in the kernel proper.
