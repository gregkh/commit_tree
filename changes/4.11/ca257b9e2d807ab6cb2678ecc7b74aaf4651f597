can: rcar_can: Do not print virtual addresses

During probe, the rcar_can driver prints:

    rcar_can e6e80000.can: device registered (regs @ e08bc000, IRQ76)

The "regs" value is a virtual address, exposing internal information,
hence stop printing it.  The (useful) physical address is already
printed as part of the device name.
