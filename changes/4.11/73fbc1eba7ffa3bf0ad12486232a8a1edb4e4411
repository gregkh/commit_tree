MIPS: fix mem=X@Y commandline processing

When a memory offset is specified through the commandline, add the
memory in range PHYS_OFFSET:Y as reserved memory area.
Otherwise the bootmem allocator is initialised with low page equal to
min_low_pfn = PHYS_OFFSET, and in free_all_bootmem will process pages
starting from min_low_pfn instead of PFN(Y).
