net: moxa: fix TX overrun memory leak

moxart_mac_start_xmit() doesn't care where tx_tail is, tx_head can
catch and pass tx_tail, which is bad because moxart_tx_finished()
isn't guaranteed to catch up on freeing resources from tx_tail.

Add a check in moxart_mac_start_xmit() stopping the queue at the
end of the circular buffer. Also add a check in moxart_tx_finished()
waking the queue if the buffer has TX_WAKE_THRESHOLD or more
free descriptors.

While we're at it, move spin_lock_irq() to happen before our
descriptor pointer is assigned in moxart_mac_start_xmit().
