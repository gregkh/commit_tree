PCI: hv: Use device serial number as PCI domain

Use the device serial number as the PCI domain.  The serial numbers start
with 1 and are unique within a VM.  So names, such as VF NIC names, that
include domain number as part of the name, can be shorter than that based
on part of bus UUID previously.  The new names will also stay same for VMs
created with copied VHD and same number of devices.
