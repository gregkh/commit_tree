usb: dwc3: host: pass quirk-broken-port-ped property for known broken revisions

dwc3 revisions <=3.00a have a limitation where Port Disable command
doesn't work. Set the quirk-broken-port-ped property for such
controllers so XHCI core can do the necessary workaround.

[rogerq@ti.com] Updated code from platform data to device property.
