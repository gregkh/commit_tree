i2c: exynos5: Avoid transaction timeouts due TRANSFER_DONE_AUTO not set

After commit 7999eecb7e56 ("i2c: exynos5: fix arbitration lost handling"),
some I2C transactions are failing because the TRANSFER_DONE_AUTO field is
not set in the I2C_TRANS_STATUS register so the i2c->status value is left
to -EINVAL causing the i2c->msg_complete completion to never be signaled.

For example, when reading the time of an I2C rtc on an Exynos5800 machine:

$ cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/time
[   25.924594] exynos5-hsi2c 12e10000.i2c: rx timeout
[   65.028365] max77686-rtc max77802-rtc: Fail to read time reg(-22)
cat: /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/time: Invalid argument

The Exynos5422 manual states clearly that most I2C_TRANS_STATUS reg bits
(including TRANSFER_DONE_AUTO) are cleared after the register is read. So
reading has side effects and should only be done if HSI2C_INT_I2C was set.
