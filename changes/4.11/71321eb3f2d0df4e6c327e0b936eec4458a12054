ALSA: timer: Reject user params with too small ticks

When a user sets a too small ticks with a fine-grained timer like
hrtimer, the kernel tries to fire up the timer irq too frequently.
This may lead to the condensed locks, eventually the kernel spinlock
lockup with warnings.

For avoiding such a situation, we define a lower limit of the
resolution, namely 1ms.  When the user passes a too small tick value
that results in less than that, the kernel returns -EINVAL now.
