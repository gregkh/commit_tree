userfaultfd: hugetlbfs: allow registration of ranges containing huge pages

Expand the userfaultfd_register/unregister routines to allow VM_HUGETLB
vmas.  huge page alignment checking is performed after a VM_HUGETLB vma
is encountered.

Also, since there is no UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE support for huge pages do not
return that as a valid ioctl method for huge page ranges.
