userfaultfd: non-cooperative: add madvise() event for MADV_REMOVE request

When a page is removed from a shared mapping, the uffd reader should be
notified, so that it won't attempt to handle #PF events for the removed
pages.

We can reuse the UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE because from the uffd monitor point
of view, the semantices of madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) and
madvise(MADV_REMOVE) is exactly the same.
