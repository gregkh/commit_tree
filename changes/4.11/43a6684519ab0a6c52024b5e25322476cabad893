ping: implement proper locking

We got a report of yet another bug in ping

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/24/6

->disconnect() is not called with socket lock held.

Fix this by acquiring ping rwlock earlier.

Thanks to Daniel, Alexander and Andrey for letting us know this problem.
