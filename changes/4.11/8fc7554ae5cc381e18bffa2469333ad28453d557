cpufreq: intel_pstate: Calculate guaranteed performance for HWP

When HWP is active, turbo activation ratio is not used to calculate max
non turbo ratio. But on these systems the max non turbo ratio is decided
by config TDP settings.

This change removes usage of MSR_TURBO_ACTIVATION_RATIO for HWP systems,
instead directly use TDP ratios, when more than one TDPs are available.
