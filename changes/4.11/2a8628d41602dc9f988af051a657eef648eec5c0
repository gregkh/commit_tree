powerpc/mm: Allow memory hotplug into an offline node

Relax the check preventing us from hotplugging into an offline node.

This limitation was added in commit 482ec7c403d2 ("[PATCH] powerpc numa:
Support sparse online node map") to prevent adding resources to an
uninitialized node.

These days, there is no harm in doing so. The addition will actually
cause the node to be initialized and onlined; add_memory_resource()
calls hotadd_new_pgdat() (if necessary) and node_set_online().
