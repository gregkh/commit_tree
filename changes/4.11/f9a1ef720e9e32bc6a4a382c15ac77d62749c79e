net/mlx5: Add MTPPS and MTPPSE registers infrastructure

Implement query and set functionality for MTPPS and MTPPSE registers.
MTPPS (Management Pulse Per Second) provides the device PPS capabilities,
configures the PPS in and out modules and holds the PPS in time stamp.
Query MTPPS is supported only when HCA_CAP.pps is set and modify is supported
when HCA_CAP.pps_modify is set.

MTPPSE (Management Pulse Per Second Event) configures the different event
generation modes for PPS. Supported when HCA_CAP.pps is set.
