PM / core: Update kerneldoc comments in pm.h

Refresh the struct dev_pm_ops kerneldoc comment, so that it looks
better and is more readable after processing by Sphinx, and drop
the kerneldoc marker from a few other comments ("PM_EVENT_ messages"
and a couple of enum types declarations) which are not proper
kerneldoc and generally confuse Sphinx.

Also change the comment describing struct dev_pm_domain into
a kerneldoc one.
