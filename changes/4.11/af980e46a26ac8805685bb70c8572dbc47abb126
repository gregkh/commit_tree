tcmu: make cmd timeout configurable

A single daemon could implement multiple types of devices
using multuple types of real devices that may not support
restarting from crashes and/or handling tcmu timeouts. This
makes the cmd timeout configurable, so handlers that do not
support it can turn if off for now.
