powerpc/mm/autonuma: switch ppc64 to its own implementation of saved write

With this our protnone becomes a present pte with READ/WRITE/EXEC bit
cleared.  By default we also set _PAGE_PRIVILEGED on such pte.  This is
now used to help us identify a protnone pte that as saved write bit.
For such pte, we will clear the _PAGE_PRIVILEGED bit.  The pte still
remain non-accessible from both user and kernel.
