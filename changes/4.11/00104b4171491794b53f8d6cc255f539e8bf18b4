KVM: MIPS: Drop partial KVM_NMI implementation

MIPS incompletely implements the KVM_NMI ioctl to supposedly perform a
CPU reset, but all it actually does is invalidate the ASIDs. It doesn't
expose the KVM_CAP_USER_NMI capability which is supposed to indicate the
presence of the KVM_NMI ioctl, and no user software actually uses it on
MIPS.

Since this is dead code that would technically need updating for GVA
page table handling in upcoming patches, remove it now. If we wanted to
implement NMI injection later it can always be done properly along with
the KVM_CAP_USER_NMI capability, and if we wanted to implement a proper
CPU reset it would be better done with a separate ioctl.
