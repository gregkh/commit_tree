SMB3: Rename clone_range to copychunk_range

Server side copy is one of the most important mechanisms smb2/smb3
supports and it was unintentionally disabled for most use cases.

Renaming calls to reflect the underlying smb2 ioctl called. This is
similar to the name duplicate_extents used for a similar ioctl which is
also used to duplicate files by reusing fs blocks. The name change is to
avoid confusion.
