reset: make zx2967 explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

   config RESET_ZX2967
          bool "ZTE ZX2967 Reset Driver

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since builtin_platform_driver() was already in use, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file does not appear
to use __init prefix anywhere.
