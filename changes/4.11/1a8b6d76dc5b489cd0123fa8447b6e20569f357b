net:add one common config ARCH_WANT_RELAX_ORDER to support relax ordering

Relax ordering(RO) is one feature of 82599 NIC, to enable this feature can
enhance the performance for some cpu architecure, such as SPARC and so on.
Currently it only supports one special cpu architecture(SPARC) in 82599
driver to enable RO feature, this is not very common for other cpu architecture
which really needs RO feature.
This patch add one common config CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_RELAX_ORDER to set RO feature,
and should define CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_RELAX_ORDER in sparc Kconfig firstly.
