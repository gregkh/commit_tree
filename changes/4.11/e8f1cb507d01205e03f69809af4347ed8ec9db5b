qed*: Update to dual-license

Since the submission of the qedr driver, there's inconsistency
in the licensing of the various qed/qede files - some are GPLv2
and some are dual-license.
Since qedr requires dual-license and it's dependent on both,
we're updating the licensing of all qed/qede source files.
