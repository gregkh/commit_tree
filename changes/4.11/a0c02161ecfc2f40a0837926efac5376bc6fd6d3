net: dsa: variable number of ports

Change the ports[DSA_MAX_PORTS] array of the dsa_switch structure for a
zero-length array, allocated at the same time as the dsa_switch
structure itself. A dsa_switch_alloc() helper is provided for that.

This commit brings no functional change yet since we pass DSA_MAX_PORTS
as the number of ports for the moment. Future patches can update the DSA
drivers separately to support dynamic number of ports.
