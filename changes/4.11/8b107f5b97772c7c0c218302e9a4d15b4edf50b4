f2fs: avoid to issue redundant discard commands

If segs_per_sec is over 1 like under SMR, previously f2fs issues discard
commands redundantly on the same section, since we didn't move end position
for the previous discard command.

E.g.,

                       start  end
                         |    |
      prefree_bitmap = [01111100111100]

And, after issue discard for this section,
                             end      start
                              |        |
      prefree_bitmap = [01111100111100]

Select this section again by searching from (end + 1),
                             start  end
                                |   |
      prefree_bitmap = [01111100111100]
