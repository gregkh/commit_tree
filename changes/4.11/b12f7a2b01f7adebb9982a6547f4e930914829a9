cpufreq: powernv: Add boost files to export ultra-turbo frequencies

In P8+, Workload Optimized Frequency(WOF) provides the capability to
boost the cpu frequency based on the utilization of the other cpus
running in the chip. The On-Chip-Controller(OCC) firmware will control
the achievability of these frequencies depending on the power headroom
available in the chip. Currently the ultra-turbo frequencies provided
by this feature are exported along with the turbo and sub-turbo
frequencies as scaling_available_frequencies. This patch will export
the ultra-turbo frequencies separately as scaling_boost_frequencies in
WOF enabled systems. This patch will add the boost sysfs file which
can be used to disable/enable ultra-turbo frequencies.
