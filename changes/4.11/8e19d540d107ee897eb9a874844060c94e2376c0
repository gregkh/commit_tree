zram: extend zero pages to same element pages

The idea is that without doing more calculations we extend zero pages to
same element pages for zram.  zero page is special case of same element
page with zero element.

1. the test is done under android 7.0
2. startup too many applications circularly
3. sample the zero pages, same pages (none-zero element)
   and total pages in function page_zero_filled

the result is listed as below:

ZERO	SAME	TOTAL
36214	17842	598196

		ZERO/TOTAL	 SAME/TOTAL	  (ZERO+SAME)/TOTAL ZERO/SAME
AVERAGE	0.060631909	 0.024990816  0.085622726		2.663825038
STDEV	0.00674612	 0.005887625  0.009707034		2.115881328
MAX		0.069698422	 0.030046087  0.094975336		7.56043956
MIN		0.03959586	 0.007332205  0.056055193		1.928985507

from the above data, the benefit is about 2.5% and up to 3% of total
swapout pages.

The defect of the patch is that when we recovery a page from non-zero
element the operations are low efficient for partial read.

This patch extends zero_page to same_page so if there is any user to
have monitored zero_pages, he will be surprised if the number is
increased but it's not harmful, I believe.
