xfrm_user: validate XFRM_MSG_NEWAE incoming ESN size harder

Kees Cook has pointed out that xfrm_replay_state_esn_len() is subject to
wrapping issues.  To ensure we are correctly ensuring that the two ESN
structures are the same size compare both the overall size as reported
by xfrm_replay_state_esn_len() and the internal length are the same.
