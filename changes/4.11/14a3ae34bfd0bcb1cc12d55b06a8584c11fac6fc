cxl: Prevent read/write to AFU config space while AFU not configured

During EEH recovery, we deconfigure all AFUs whilst leaving the
corresponding vPHB and virtual PCI device in place.

If something attempts to interact with the AFU's PCI config space (e.g.
running lspci) after the AFU has been deconfigured and before it's
reconfigured, cxl_pcie_{read,write}_config() will read invalid values from
the deconfigured struct cxl_afu and proceed to Oops when they try to
dereference pointers that have been set to NULL during deconfiguration.

Add a rwsem to struct cxl_afu so we can prevent interaction with config
space while the AFU is deconfigured.
