drm/i915: Stop the machine as we install the wedged submit_request handler

In order to prevent a race between the old callback submitting an
incomplete request and i915_gem_set_wedged() installing its nop handler,
we must ensure that the swap occurs when the machine is idle
(stop_machine).

v2: move context lost from out of BKL.
