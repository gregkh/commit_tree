mmc: core: Move public functions from host.h to private headers

A significant amount of functions are available through the public mmc
host.h header file. Let's slim down this public mmc interface, as to
prevent users from abusing it, by moving some of the functions to private
mmc host.h header file.

This change concentrates on moving the functions into private mmc headers,
following changes may continue with additional clean-ups.
