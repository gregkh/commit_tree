metag/usercopy: Fix alignment error checking

Fix the error checking of the alignment adjustment code in
raw_copy_from_user(), which mistakenly considers it safe to skip the
error check when aligning the source buffer on a 2 or 4 byte boundary.

If the destination buffer was unaligned it may have started to copy
using byte or word accesses, which could well be at the start of a new
(valid) source page. This would result in it appearing to have copied 1
or 2 bytes at the end of the first (invalid) page rather than none at
all.
