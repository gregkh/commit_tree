ipv6: check for ip6_null_entry in __ip6_del_rt_siblings()

Andrey reported a NULL pointer deref bug in ipv6_route_ioctl()
-> ip6_route_del() -> __ip6_del_rt_siblings() code path. This is
because ip6_null_entry is returned in this path since ip6_null_entry
is kinda default for a ipv6 route table root node. Quote from
David Ahern:

 ip6_null_entry is the root of all ipv6 fib tables making it integrated
 into the table ...

We should ignore any attempt of trying to delete it, like we do in
__ip6_del_rt() path and several others.
