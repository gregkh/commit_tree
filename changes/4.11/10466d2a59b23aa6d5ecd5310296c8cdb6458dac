drm/i915: Fix phys pwrite for struct_mutex-less operation

Since commit fe115628d567 ("drm/i915: Implement pwrite without
struct-mutex") the lowlevel pwrite calls are now called without the
protection of struct_mutex, but pwrite_phys was still asserting that it
held the struct_mutex and later tried to drop and relock it.
