scripts/spelling.txt: add "an user" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  an user||a user
  an userspace||a userspace

I also added "userspace" to the list since it is a common word in Linux.
I found some instances for "an userfaultfd", but I did not add it to the
list.  I felt it is endless to find words that start with "user" such as
"userland" etc., so must draw a line somewhere.
