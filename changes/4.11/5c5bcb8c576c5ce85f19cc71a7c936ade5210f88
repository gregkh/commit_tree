power: supply: axp288_charger: Get and process initial hardware-state

Do not wait for an extcon notification before processing the cable
states, instead queue the otg / cable work on probe to make sure we
immediately process the initial hardware state.

Note this also requiree moving the getting of the USB_HOST cable state
from the extcon notifier to the workqueue function.
