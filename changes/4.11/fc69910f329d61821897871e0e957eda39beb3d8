MIPS: Add missing include files

After the split of linux/sched.h, several platforms in arch/mips stopped building.

Add the respective additional #include statements to fix the problem I first
tried adding these into asm/processor.h, but ran into circular header
dependencies with that which I could not figure out.

The commit I listed as causing the problem is the branch merge, as there is
likely a combination of multiple patches in that branch.
