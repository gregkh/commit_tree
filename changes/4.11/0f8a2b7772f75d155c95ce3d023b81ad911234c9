ath10k: fix per station tx bit rate reporting

Not clearing the previous tx bit rate status
results in a ambigous tx bit rate reporting to
mac80211/cfg80211, for example the previous bit
rate status would have been marked as legacy rate
, while the current rate would have been an HT/VHT
rate with the tx bit rate flags set and this results
in exporting tx bitrate as legacy rate but with HT/VHT
rate flags set, fix this by clearing the tx bitrate
status for each event. This also fixes the below
warning when we do:

iw dev wlan#N station dump
