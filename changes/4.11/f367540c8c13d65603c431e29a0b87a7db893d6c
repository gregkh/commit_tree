tools lib bpf: Add BPF program pinning APIs

Add new APIs to pin a BPF program (or specific instances) to the
filesystem.  The user can specify the path full path within a BPF
filesystem to pin the program.

bpf_program__pin_instance(prog, path, n) will pin the nth instance of
'prog' to the specified path.

bpf_program__pin(prog, path) will create the directory 'path' (if it
does not exist) and pin each instance within that directory. For
instance, path/0, path/1, path/2.

Committer notes:

- Add missing headers for mkdir()

- Check strdup() for failure

- Check snprintf >= size, not >, as == also means truncated, see 'man
  snprintf', return value.

- Conditionally define BPF_FS_MAGIC, as it isn't in magic.h in older
  systems and we're not yet having a tools/include/uapi/linux/magic.h
  copy.

- Do not include linux/magic.h, not present in older distros.
