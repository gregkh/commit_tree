USB: serial: quatech2: fix control-message error handling

Make sure to detect short control-message transfers when fetching
modem and line state in open and when retrieving registers.

This specifically makes sure that an errno is returned to user space on
errors in TIOCMGET instead of a zero bitmask.

Also drop the unused getdevice function which also lacked appropriate
error handling.
