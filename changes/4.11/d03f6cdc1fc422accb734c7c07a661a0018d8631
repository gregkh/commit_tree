block: Dynamically allocate and refcount backing_dev_info

Instead of storing backing_dev_info inside struct request_queue,
allocate it dynamically, reference count it, and free it when the last
reference is dropped. Currently only request_queue holds the reference
but in the following patch we add other users referencing
backing_dev_info.
