can: flexcan: activate individual RX masking and initialize reg_rximr

Modern flexcan IP cores support two RX modes. One is using the 6 fames deep
hardware FIFO, the other is using up to 64 mailboxes (in non FIFO mode). For
now only the HW FIFO mode is activated.

In order to make use of the RX mailboxes the individual RX masking feature has
to be activated, otherwise matching mailboxes are overwritten during the
reception process. This however switches on the individual RX masking, which
uses reg_rximr registers for masking.

This patch activates the individual RX masking feature unconditionally and
initializes the mask registers (reg_rximr) with 0x0 == "don't care", which
switches off any filtering.
