selinux: drop unused socket security classes

Several of the extended socket classes introduced by
commit da69a5306ab92e07 ("selinux: support distinctions
among all network address families") are never used because
sockets can never be created with the associated address family.
Remove these unused socket security classes.  The removed classes
are bridge_socket for PF_BRIDGE, ib_socket for PF_IB, and mpls_socket
for PF_MPLS.
