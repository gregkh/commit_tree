kvm: nVMX: move nested events check to kvm_vcpu_running

vcpu_run calls kvm_vcpu_running, not kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable,
and the former does not call check_nested_events.

Once KVM_REQ_EVENT is removed from the APICv interrupt injection
path, however, this would leave no place to trigger a vmexit
from L2 to L1, causing a missed interrupt delivery while in guest
mode.  This is caught by the "ack interrupt on exit" test in
vmx.flat.

[This does not change the calls to check_nested_events in
 inject_pending_event.  That is material for a separate cleanup.]
