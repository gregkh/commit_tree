drm/etnaviv: (re-)protect fence allocation with GPU mutex

The fence allocation needs to be protected by the GPU mutex, otherwise
the fence seqnos of concurrent submits might not match the insertion order
of the jobs in the kernel ring. This breaks the assumption that jobs
complete with monotonically increasing fence seqnos.
