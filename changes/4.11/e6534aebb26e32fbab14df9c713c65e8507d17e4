crypto: algif_aead - Fix bogus request dereference in completion function

The algif_aead completion function tries to deduce the aead_request
from the crypto_async_request argument.  This is broken because
the API does not guarantee that the same request will be pased to
the completion function.  Only the value of req->data can be used
in the completion function.

This patch fixes it by storing a pointer to sk in areq and using
that instead of passing in sk through req->data.
