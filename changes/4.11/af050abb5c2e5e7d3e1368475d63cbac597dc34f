platform/x86: intel_turbo_max_3: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/platform/x86/Kconfig:config INTEL_TURBO_MAX_3
drivers/platform/x86/Kconfig:   bool "Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 enumeration driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We do uncover some implicit includes during build coverage that
were hidden behind the module.h which pulls in a lot of dependants.
