netvsc: optimize receive path

Do manual optimizations of receive path:
  - remove checks for impossible conditions (but keep checks
    for bad data from host)
  - pass argument down, rather than having callee recompute what
    is already known
  - remove indirection about receive buffer datalength
  - remove dependence on VLAN_TAG_PRESENCE
  - use _hot/_cold and likely/unlikely
