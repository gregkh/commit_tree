KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Allow KVM_PPC_ALLOCATE_HTAB ioctl() to change HPT size

The KVM_PPC_ALLOCATE_HTAB ioctl() is used to set the size of hashed page
table (HPT) that userspace expects a guest VM to have, and is also used to
clear that HPT when necessary (e.g. guest reboot).

At present, once the ioctl() is called for the first time, the HPT size can
never be changed thereafter - it will be cleared but always sized as from
the first call.

With upcoming HPT resize implementation, we're going to need to allow
userspace to resize the HPT at reset (to change it back to the default size
if the guest changed it).

So, we need to allow this ioctl() to change the HPT size.

This patch also updates Documentation/virtual/kvm/api.txt to reflect
the new behaviour.  In fact the documentation was already slightly
incorrect since 572abd5 "KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't fall back to
smaller HPT size in allocation ioctl"
