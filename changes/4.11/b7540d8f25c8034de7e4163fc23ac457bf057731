mac80211: don't reorder frames with SN smaller than SSN

When RX aggregation starts, transmitter may continue send frames
with SN smaller than SSN until the AddBA response is received.
However, the reorder buffer is already initialized at this point,
which will cause the drop of such frames as duplicates since the
head SN of the reorder buffer is set to the SSN, which is bigger.
