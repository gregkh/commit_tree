tty/serial: atmel: fix TX path in atmel_console_write()

A side effect of 89d8232411a8 ("tty/serial: atmel_serial: BUG: stop DMA
from transmitting in stop_tx") is that the console can be called with
TX path disabled. Then the system would hang trying to push charecters
out in atmel_console_putchar().
