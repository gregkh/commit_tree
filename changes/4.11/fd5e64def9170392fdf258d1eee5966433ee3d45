target: Remove command flag CMD_T_BUSY

The patch that reworks task management function handling guarantees
that target_remove_from_state_list() is always called with CMD_T_BUSY
cleared. Since that function is the only function that tests that flag
this means that that flag is now superfluous. Hence remove that flag.
