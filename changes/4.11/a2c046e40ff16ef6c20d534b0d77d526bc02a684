KVM: MIPS: Add vcpu_run() & vcpu_reenter() callbacks

Add implementation callbacks for entering the guest (vcpu_run()) and
reentering the guest (vcpu_reenter()), allowing implementation specific
operations to be performed before entering the guest or after returning
to the host without cluttering kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run().

This allows the T&E specific lazy user GVA flush to be moved into
trap_emul.c, along with disabling of the HTW. We also move
kvm_mips_deliver_interrupts() as VZ will need to restore the guest timer
state prior to delivering interrupts.
