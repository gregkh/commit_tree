drm/imx: imx-tve: Do not set the regulator voltage

Commit deb65870b5d9d ("drm/imx: imx-tve: check the value returned by
regulator_set_voltage()") exposes the following probe issue:

63ff0000.tve supply dac not found, using dummy regulator
imx-drm display-subsystem: failed to bind 63ff0000.tve (ops imx_tve_ops): -22

When the 'dac-supply' is not passed in the device tree a dummy regulator is
used and setting its voltage is not allowed.

To fix this issue, do not set the dac-supply voltage inside the driver
and let its voltage be specified in the device tree.

Print a warning if the the 'dac-supply' voltage has a value different
from 2.75V.
