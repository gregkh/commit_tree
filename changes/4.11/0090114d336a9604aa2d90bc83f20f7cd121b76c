usb: musb: cppi41: don't check early-TX-interrupt for Isoch transfer

The CPPI 4.1 driver polls register to workaround the premature TX
interrupt issue, but it causes audio playback underrun when triggered in
Isoch transfers.

Isoch doesn't do back-to-back transfers, the TX should be done by the
time the next transfer is scheduled. So skip this polling workaround for
Isoch transfer.
