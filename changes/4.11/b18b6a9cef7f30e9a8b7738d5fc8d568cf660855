timers: Omit POSIX timer stuff from task_struct when disabled

When CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS is disabled, it is preferable to remove related
structures from struct task_struct and struct signal_struct as they
won't contain anything useful and shouldn't be relied upon by mistake.
Code still referencing those structures is also disabled here.
