bindings: rtc: correct wrong reference in required properties

There are currently two broken bindings descriptions for RTC:

maxim,ds3231.txt
pcf8563.txt

They broke because of a improper RST documentation conversion with
commit 8c27ceff3604b2 ("docs: fix locations of several documents that got
moved") and now reference to a non-existing file:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/trivial-admin-guide/devices.rst

However, the original reference to i2c/trivial-devices should have never
been made in the first place.

This change fixes this issue by replacing with correct descriptions.
