spi: imx: adjust watermark level according to transfer length

Previously DMA watermark level is configured to fifosize/2,
DMA mode can be used only when transfer length can be divided
by 'watermark level * bpw', which makes DMA mode not pratical.

This patch adjusts watermark level to largest number (no bigger
than fifosize/2) which can divide 'tranfer length / bpw' for
each transfer.
