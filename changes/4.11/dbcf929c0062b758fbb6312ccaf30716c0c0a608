powerpc/pseries: Add support for hash table resizing

This adds support for using two hypercalls to change the size of the
main hash page table while running as a PAPR guest. For now these
hypercalls are only in experimental qemu versions.

The interface is two part: first H_RESIZE_HPT_PREPARE is used to
allocate and prepare the new hash table. This may be slow, but can be
done asynchronously. Then, H_RESIZE_HPT_COMMIT is used to switch to the
new hash table. This requires that no CPUs be concurrently updating the
HPT, and so must be run under stop_machine().

This also adds a debugfs file which can be used to manually control
HPT resizing or testing purposes.
