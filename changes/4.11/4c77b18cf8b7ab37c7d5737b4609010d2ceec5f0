sched/fair: Make select_idle_cpu() more aggressive

Kitsunyan reported desktop latency issues on his Celeron 887 because
of commit:

  1b568f0aabf2 ("sched/core: Optimize SCHED_SMT")

... even though his CPU doesn't do SMT.

The effect of running the SMT code on a !SMT part is basically a more
aggressive select_idle_cpu(). Removing the avg condition fixed things
for him.

I also know FB likes this test gone, even though other workloads like
having it.

For now, take it out by default, until we get a better idea.
