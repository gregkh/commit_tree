nvme: Adjust the Samsung APST quirk

I got a couple more reports: the Samsung APST issues appears to
affect multiple 950-series devices in Dell XPS 15 9550 and Precision
5510 laptops.  Change the quirk: rather than blacklisting the
firmware on the first problematic SSD that was reported, disable
APST on all 144d:a802 devices if they're installed in the two
affected Dell models.  While we're at it, disable only the deepest
sleep state instead of all of them -- the reporters say that this is
sufficient to fix the problem.

(I have a device that appears to be entirely identical to one of the
affected devices, but I have a different Dell laptop, so it's not
the case that all Samsung devices with firmware BXW75D0Q are broken
under all circumstances.)

Samsung engineers have an affected system, and hopefully they'll
give us a better workaround some time soon.  In the mean time, this
should minimize regressions.
