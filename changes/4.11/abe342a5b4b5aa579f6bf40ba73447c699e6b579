tcmu: Fix wrongly calculating of the base_command_size

The t_data_nents and t_bidi_data_nents are the numbers of the
segments, but it couldn't be sure the block size equals to size
of the segment.

For the worst case, all the blocks are discontiguous and there
will need the same number of iovecs, that's to say: blocks == iovs.
So here just set the number of iovs to block count needed by tcmu
cmd.
