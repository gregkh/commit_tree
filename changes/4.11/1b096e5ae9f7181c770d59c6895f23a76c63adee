z3fold: extend compaction function

z3fold_compact_page() currently only handles the situation when there's
a single middle chunk within the z3fold page.  However it may be worth
it to move middle chunk closer to either first or last chunk, whichever
is there, if the gap between them is big enough.

This patch adds the relevant code, using BIG_CHUNK_GAP define as a
threshold for middle chunk to be worth moving.
