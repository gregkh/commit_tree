net: neigh: guard against NULL solicit() method

Dmitry posted a nice reproducer of a bug triggering in neigh_probe()
when dereferencing a NULL neigh->ops->solicit method.

This can happen for arp_direct_ops/ndisc_direct_ops and similar,
which can be used for NUD_NOARP neighbours (created when dev->header_ops
is NULL). Admin can then force changing nud_state to some other state
that would fire neigh timer.
