x86/intel_rdt: Put group node in rdtgroup_kn_unlock

The rdtgroup_kn_unlock waits for the last user to release and put its
node. But it's calling kernfs_put on the node which calls the
rdtgroup_kn_unlock, which might not be the group's directory node, but
another group's file node.

This race could be easily reproduced by running 2 instances
of following script:

  mount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl/
  pushd /sys/fs/resctrl/
  mkdir krava
  echo "krava" > krava/schemata
  rmdir krava
  popd
  umount  /sys/fs/resctrl

It triggers the slub debug error message with following command
line config: slub_debug=,kernfs_node_cache.

Call kernfs_put on the group's node to fix it.
