KVM: arm64: Increase number of user memslots to 512

Having only 32 memslots is a real constraint for the maximum
number of PCI devices that can be assigned to a single guest.
Assuming each PCI device/virtual function having two memory BAR
regions, we could assign only 15 devices/virtual functions to a
guest.

Hence increase KVM_USER_MEM_SLOTS to 512 as done in other archs like
powerpc.
