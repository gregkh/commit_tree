iwlwifi: pcie: Re-configure IVAR table after stop device

When getting RF_KILL and disabling radio, the device gets stopped
and reset. This erases the IVAR table that matches the interrupt
to its cause, and is essential for MSIX proper functionality.
Till now, the table wasn't re-configured after the reset, and
therefore the interrupt that enabled radio didn't fire on the
right irq, and the driver didn't handle it correctly.

To fix this, configure the IVAR table again after resetting the
device.
