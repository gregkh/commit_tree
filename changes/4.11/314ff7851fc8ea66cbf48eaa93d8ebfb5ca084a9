mm/vmacache, sched/headers: Introduce 'struct vmacache' and move it from <linux/sched.h> to <linux/mm_types>

The <linux/sched.h> header includes various vmacache related defines,
which are arguably misplaced.

Move them to mm_types.h and minimize the sched.h impact by putting
all task vmacache state into a new 'struct vmacache' structure.

No change in functionality.
