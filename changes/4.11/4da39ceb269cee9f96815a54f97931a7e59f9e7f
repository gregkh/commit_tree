cpupower: Restore format of frequency-info limit

The intel_pstate kselftest expects that the output of
`cpupower frequency-info -l | tail -1 | awk ' { print $1 } '`
to get frequency limits.  This does not work after the following two
changes.

 - 562e5f1a3: rework the "cpupower frequency-info" command
   (Jacob Tanenbaum) removed parsable limit output
 - ce512b840: Do not analyse offlined cpus
   (Thomas Renninger) added newline to break limit parsing more

This change preserves human readable output if wanted as well as
parsable output for scripts/tests.
