scsi: atari_scsi: Reset DMA during bus reset only under ST-DMA lock

The atari_scsi driver should not access Falcon DMA chip registers unless
it has acquired exclusive access to that chip. If the driver doesn't
have exclusive access then there's no need for a DMA reset as there are
no scsi commands in progress.
