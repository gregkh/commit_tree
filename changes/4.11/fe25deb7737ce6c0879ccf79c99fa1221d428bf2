drm/ttm, drm/vmwgfx: Relax permission checking when opening surfaces

Previously, when a surface was opened using a legacy (non prime) handle,
it was verified to have been created by a client in the same master realm.
Relax this so that opening is also allowed recursively if the client
already has the surface open.

This works around a regression in svga mesa where opening of a shared
surface is used recursively to obtain surface information.
