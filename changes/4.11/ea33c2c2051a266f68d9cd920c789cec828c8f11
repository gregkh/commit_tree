ARM: sun8i: a33: add operating-points-v2 property to all nodes

The OPP are declared as shared but no operating points are declared for
cpu1, 2 and 3. Thus, the following error happens during the boot:

cpu cpu1: dev_pm_opp_of_get_sharing_cpus: Couldn't find tcpu_dev node.

This patch applies the operating points to each cpu of the A33.
