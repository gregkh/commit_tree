mm: vmpressure: fix sending wrong events on underflow

At the end of a window period, if the reclaimed pages is greater than
scanned, an unsigned underflow can result in a huge pressure value and
thus a critical event.  Reclaimed pages is found to go higher than
scanned because of the addition of reclaimed slab pages to reclaimed in
shrink_node without a corresponding increment to scanned pages.

Minchan Kim mentioned that this can also happen in the case of a THP
page where the scanned is 1 and reclaimed could be 512.
