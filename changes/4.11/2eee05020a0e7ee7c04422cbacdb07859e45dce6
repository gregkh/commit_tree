USB: serial: opticon: fix CTS retrieval at open

The opticon driver used a control request at open to trigger a CTS
status notification to be sent over the bulk-in pipe. When the driver
was converted to using the generic read implementation, an inverted test
prevented this request from being sent, something which could lead to
TIOCMGET reporting an incorrect CTS state.
