staging: lustre: llite: Trust creates in revalidate too.

By forcing creates to always go via lookup we lose some
important caching benefits too.
Instead let's trust creates with positive cached entries.

Then we have 3 possible outcomes:
1. Negative dentry - we go via atomic_open and do the create
   by name there.
2. Positive dentry, no contention - we just go straight to
   ll_intent_file_open and open by fid.
3. positive dentry, contention - by the time we reach the server,
   the inode is gone. We get ENOENT which is unacceptable to return
   from create. But since we know it's a create, we substitute it
   with ESTALE and VFS retries again with LOOKUP_REVAL set, we catch
   that in revalidate and force a lookup (same path as before this
   patch).
