vfs: deny fallocate() on directory

There was an obscure use case of fallocate of directory inode
in the vfs helper with the comment:
"Let individual file system decide if it supports preallocation
 for directories or not."

But there is no in-tree file system that implements fallocate
for directory operations.

Deny an attempt to fallocate a directory with EISDIR error.

This change is needed prior to converting sb_start_write()
to  file_start_write(), so freeze protection is correctly
handled for cases of fallocate file and blockdev.
