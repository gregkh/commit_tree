mm: add arch-independent testcases for RODATA

This patch makes arch-independent testcases for RODATA.  Both x86 and
x86_64 already have testcases for RODATA, But they are arch-specific
because using inline assembly directly.

And cacheflush.h is not a suitable location for rodata-test related
things.  Since they were in cacheflush.h, If someone change the state of
CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA_TEST, It cause overhead of kernel build.

To solve the above issues, write arch-independent testcases and move it
to shared location.
