sched/headers: Prepare for the reduction of <linux/sched.h>'s signal API dependency

Instead of including the full <linux/signal.h>, we are going to include the
types-only <linux/signal_types.h> header in <linux/sched.h>, to further
decouple the scheduler header from the signal headers.

This means that various files which relied on the full <linux/signal.h> need
to be updated to gain an explicit dependency on it.

Update the code that relies on sched.h's inclusion of the <linux/signal.h> header.
