USB: serial: ti_usb_3410_5052: fix control-message error handling

Make sure to detect and return an error on zero-length control-message
transfers when reading from the device.

This addresses a potential failure to detect an empty transmit buffer
during close.

Also remove a redundant check for short transfer when sending a command.
