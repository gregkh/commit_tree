scripts/spelling.txt: add "swith" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  swith||switch
  swithable||switchable
  swithed||switched
  swithing||switching

While we are here, fix the "update" to "updates" in the touched hunk in
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/wmm.c.
