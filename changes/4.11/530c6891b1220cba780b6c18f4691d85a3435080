target: allow ALUA setup for some passthrough backends

This patch allows passthrough backends to use the core/base LIO
ALUA setup and state checks, but still handle the execution of
commands.

This will allow the target_core_user module to execute STPG and RTPG
in userspace, and not have to duplicate the ALUA state checks, path
information (needed so we can check if command is executable on
specific paths) and setup (rtslib sets/updates the configfs ALUA
interface like it does for iblock or file).

For STPG, the target_core_user userspace daemon, tcmu-runner will
still execute the STPG, and to update the core/base LIO state it
will use the existing configfs interface. For RTPG, tcmu-runner
will loop over configfs and/or cache the state.
