userfaultfd: hugetlbfs: add UFFDIO_COPY support for shared mappings

When userfaultfd hugetlbfs support was originally added, it followed the
pattern of anon mappings and did not support any vmas marked VM_SHARED.
As such, support was only added for private mappings.

Remove this limitation and support shared mappings.  The primary
functional change required is adding pages to the page cache.  More subtle
changes are required for huge page reservation handling in error paths.  A
lengthy comment in the code describes the reservation handling.
