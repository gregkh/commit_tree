regulator: arizona-micsupp: Use SoC component pin control functions

The name of a codec pin can have an optional prefix string, which is
defined by the SoC machine driver. The snd_soc_dapm_x_pin functions
take the fully-specified name including the prefix and so the existing
code would fail to find the pin if the audio machine driver had added
a prefix.

Switch to using the snd_soc_component_x_pin equivalent functions that
take a specified SoC component and automatically add the name prefix to
the provided pin name.
