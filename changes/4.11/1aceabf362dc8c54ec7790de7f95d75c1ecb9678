btrfs: drop gfp mask tweaking in try_release_extent_state

try_release_extent_state reduces the gfp mask to GFP_NOFS if it is
compatible. This is true for GFP_KERNEL as well. There is no real
reason to do that though. There is no new lock taken down the
the only consumer of the gfp mask which is
try_release_extent_state
  clear_extent_bit
    __clear_extent_bit
      alloc_extent_state

So this seems just unnecessary and confusing.
