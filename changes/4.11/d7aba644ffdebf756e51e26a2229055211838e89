amd-xgbe: Enable IRQs only if napi_complete_done() is true

Depending on the hardware, the amd-xgbe driver may use disable_irq_nosync()
and enable_irq() when an interrupt is received to process Rx packets. If
the napi_complete_done() return value isn't checked an unbalanced enable
for the IRQ could result, generating a warning stack trace.

Update the driver to only enable interrupts if napi_complete_done() returns
true.
