iommu: Add a new type field in iommu_resv_region

We introduce a new field to differentiate the reserved region
types and specialize the apply_resv_region implementation.

Legacy direct mapped regions have IOMMU_RESV_DIRECT type.
We introduce 2 new reserved memory types:
- IOMMU_RESV_MSI will characterize MSI regions that are mapped
- IOMMU_RESV_RESERVED characterize regions that cannot by mapped.
