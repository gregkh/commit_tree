bnxt_en: Retry failed NVM_INSTALL_UPDATE with defragmentation flag.

If the HWRM_NVM_INSTALL_UPDATE command fails with the error code
NVM_INSTALL_UPDATE_CMD_ERR_CODE_FRAG_ERR, retry the command with
a new flag to allow defragmentation.  Since we are checking the
response for error code, we also need to take the mutex until
we finish reading the response.
