PM / wakeirq: Enable dedicated wakeirq for suspend

We currently rely on runtime PM to enable dedicated wakeirq for suspend.
This assumption fails in the following two cases:

1. If the consumer driver does not have runtime PM implemented, the
   dedicated wakeirq never gets enabled for suspend

2. If the consumer driver has runtime PM implemented, but does not idle
   in suspend

Let's fix the issue by always enabling the dedicated wakeirq during
suspend.
