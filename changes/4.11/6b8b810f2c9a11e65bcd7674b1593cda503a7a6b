staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused members from struct recv_priv

Since commit da25a8ec6b2d ("staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused
debugging functions") is_signal_dbg is never set to true, so the code
under if (adapter->recvpriv.is_signal_dbg) is dead. Remove the
variable and the dead code.

The signal_strength_dbg was referenced only in the code that is being
removed, so remove it as well.

Also fix coding style issues in the touched lines.
