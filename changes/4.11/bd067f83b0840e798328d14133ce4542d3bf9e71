powerpc/64: Fix naming of cache block vs. cache line

In a number of places we called "cache line size" what is actually
the cache block size, which in the powerpc architecture, means the
effective size to use with cache management instructions (it can
be different from the actual cache line size).

We fix the naming across the board and properly retrieve both
pieces of information when available in the device-tree.
