usb: chipidea: msm: Use hw_write_id_reg() instead of writel

The MSM_USB_BASE macro trick is not very clear, and we're using
it for only one register write so let's just move to using
hw_write_id_reg() and passing the ci pointer instead. That
clearly shows what offset we're using and avoids needing to
include the msm_hsusb_hw.h file when we're going to delete that
file soon.
