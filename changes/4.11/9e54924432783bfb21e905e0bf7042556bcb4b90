Input: pwm-beeper - add optional amplifier regulator

This adds an optional regulator to the pwm-beeper device. This regulator
acts as an amplifier. The amplifier is only enabled while beeping in order
to reduce power consumption.

Tested on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3, which has a speaker connected to PWM through
an amplifier.
