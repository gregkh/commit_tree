sctp: listen on the sock only when it's state is listening or closed

Now sctp doesn't check sock's state before listening on it. It could
even cause changing a sock with any state to become a listening sock
when doing sctp_listen.

This patch is to fix it by checking sock's state in sctp_listen, so
that it will listen on the sock with right state.
