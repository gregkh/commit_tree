mm: workingset: fix premature shadow node shrinking with cgroups

Commit 0a6b76dd23fa ("mm: workingset: make shadow node shrinker memcg
aware") enabled cgroup-awareness in the shadow node shrinker, but forgot
to also enable cgroup-awareness in the list_lru the shadow nodes sit on.

Consequently, all shadow nodes are sitting on a global (per-NUMA node)
list, while the shrinker applies the limits according to the amount of
cache in the cgroup its shrinking.  The result is excessive pressure on
the shadow nodes from cgroups that have very little cache.

Enable memcg-mode on the shadow node LRUs, such that per-cgroup limits
are applied to per-cgroup lists.
