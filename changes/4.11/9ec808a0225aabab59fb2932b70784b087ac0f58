x86/platform/UV: Ensure uv_system_init is called when necessary

Move the check to whether this is a UV system that needs initialization
from is_uv_system() to the internal uv_system_init() function.  This is
because on a UV system without a HUB the is_uv_system() returns false.
But we still need some specific UV system initialization.  See the
uv_system_init() for change to a quick check if UV is applicable. This
change should not increase overhead since is_uv_system() also called
into this same area.
