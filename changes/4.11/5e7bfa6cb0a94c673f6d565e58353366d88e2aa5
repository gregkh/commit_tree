net: phy: bcm-phy-lib: clean up remaining AUXCTL register defines

1) Use 0x%02x format for register number. This follows some other
   defines and makes it easier to distinct register from values.
2) Put register define above values and sort the values. It makes
   reading header code easier.
3) Use 0x%04x format for all values. It's about consistency with other
   values (and most of the header) not a personal preference.
4) Separate define for reading shift value with an extre empty line.
   It's user for all AUXCTL registers in a bcm54xx_auxctl_read.
