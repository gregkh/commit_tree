iommu/dma: Implement PCI allocation optimisation

Whilst PCI devices may have 64-bit DMA masks, they still benefit from
using 32-bit addresses wherever possible in order to avoid DAC (PCI) or
longer address packets (PCIe), which may incur a performance overhead.
Implement the same optimisation as other allocators by trying to get a
32-bit address first, only falling back to the full mask if that fails.
