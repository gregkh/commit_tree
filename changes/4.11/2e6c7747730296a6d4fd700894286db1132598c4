MIPS: Force o32 fp64 support on 32bit MIPS64r6 kernels

When a 32-bit kernel is configured to support MIPS64r6 (CPU_MIPS64_R6),
MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT won't be selected as it should be because
MIPS32_O32 is disabled (o32 is already the default ABI available on
32-bit kernels).

This results in userland FP breakage as CP0_Status.FR is read-only 1
since r6 (when an FPU is present) so __enable_fpu() will fail to clear
FR. This causes the FPU emulator to get used which will incorrectly
emulate 32-bit FPU registers.

Force o32 fp64 support in this case by also selecting
MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT from CPU_MIPS64_R6 if 32BIT.
