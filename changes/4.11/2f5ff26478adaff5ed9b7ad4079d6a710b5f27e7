mlx5: Fix naming convention with respect to UARs

This establishes a solid naming conventions for UARs. A UAR (User Access
Region) can have size identical to a system page or can be fixed 4KB
depending on a value queried by firmware. Each UAR always has 4 blue
flame register which are used to post doorbell to send queue. In
addition, a UAR has section used for posting doorbells to CQs or EQs. In
this patch we change names to reflect this conventions.
