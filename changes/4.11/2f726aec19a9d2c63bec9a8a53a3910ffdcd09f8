ALSA: hda - fix a problem for lineout on a Dell AIO machine

On this Dell AIO machine, the lineout jack does not work.

We found the pin 0x1a is assigned to lineout on this machine, and in
the past, we applied ALC298_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE to fix the
heaset-set mic problem for this machine, this fixup will redefine
the pin 0x1a to headphone-mic, as a result the lineout doesn't
work anymore.

After consulting with Dell, they told us this machine doesn't support
microphone via headset jack, so we add a new fixup which only defines
the pin 0x18 as the headset-mic.

[rearranged the fixup insertion position by tiwai in order to make the
 merge with other branches easier -- tiwai]
