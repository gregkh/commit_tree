staging: lustre: header: remove assert from interval_set()

In the case of interval_tree.h only interval_set()
uses LASSERT which is removed in this patch and
interval_set() instead reports a real error. The
header libcfs.h for interval_tree.h is not needed
anymore so we can just use the standard linux
kernel headers instead.h
