bridge: multicast to unicast

Implements an optional, per bridge port flag and feature to deliver
multicast packets to any host on the according port via unicast
individually. This is done by copying the packet per host and
changing the multicast destination MAC to a unicast one accordingly.

multicast-to-unicast works on top of the multicast snooping feature of
the bridge. Which means unicast copies are only delivered to hosts which
are interested in it and signalized this via IGMP/MLD reports
previously.

This feature is intended for interface types which have a more reliable
and/or efficient way to deliver unicast packets than broadcast ones
(e.g. wifi).

However, it should only be enabled on interfaces where no IGMPv2/MLDv1
report suppression takes place. This feature is disabled by default.

The initial patch and idea is from Felix Fietkau.
