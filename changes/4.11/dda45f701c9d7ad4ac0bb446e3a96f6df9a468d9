MIPS: Switch to the irq_stack in interrupts

When enterring interrupt context via handle_int or except_vec_vi, switch
to the irq_stack of the current CPU if it is not already in use.

The current stack pointer is masked with the thread size and compared to
the base or the irq stack. If it does not match then the stack pointer
is set to the top of that stack, otherwise this is a nested irq being
handled on the irq stack so the stack pointer should be left as it was.

The in-use stack pointer is placed in the callee saved register s1. It
will be saved to the stack when plat_irq_dispatch is invoked and can be
restored once control returns here.
