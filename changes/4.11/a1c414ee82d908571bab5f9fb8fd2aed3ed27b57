drm/i915: Introduce intel_release_shared_dpll()

While the details of getting a shared dpll are wrapped by
intel_get_shared_dpll(), the release was still hand rolled into the
modeset code. Fix that by creating an entry point for releasing the
pll and move that code there.

v2: Take old_dpll from crtc->state instead of crtc_state. (CI)
