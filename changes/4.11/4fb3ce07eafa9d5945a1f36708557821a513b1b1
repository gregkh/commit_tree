mmc: sunxi: Add EMMC (MMC2) controller compatible

The MMC2 controller on the A64 is kind of a special beast.

While the general controller design is the same than the other MMC
controllers in the SoC, it also has a bunch of features and changes that
prevent it to be driven in the same way.

It has for example a different bus width limit, a different maximum
frequency, and, for some reason, the maximum buffer size of a DMA
descriptor.

Add a new compatible specifically for this controller.
