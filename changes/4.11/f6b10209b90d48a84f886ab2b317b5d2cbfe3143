virtio-net: switch to use build_skb() for small buffer

This patch switch to use build_skb() for small buffer which can have
better performance for both TCP and XDP (since we can work at page
before skb creation). It also remove lots of XDP codes since both
mergeable and small buffer use page frag during refill now.

                       Before   | After
XDP_DROP(xdp1) 64B  :  11.1Mpps | 14.4Mpps

Tested with xdp1/xdp2/xdp_ip_tx_tunnel and netperf.
