IB/ipoib: Replace list_del of the neigh->list with list_del_init

In order to resolve a situation where a few process delete
the same list element in sequence and cause panic, list_del
is replaced with list_del_init. In this case if the first
process that calls list_del releases the lock before acquiring
it again, other processes who can acquire the lock will call
list_del_init.
