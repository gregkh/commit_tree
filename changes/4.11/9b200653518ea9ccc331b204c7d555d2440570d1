perf symbols: Take into account symfs setting when reading file build ID

After commit 5baecbcd9c9a ("perf symbols: we can now read separate
debug-info files based on a build ID") and when --symfs option is used
perf failed to pick up symbols for file with the same name between host
and sysroot specified by --symfs option.  One can see message like this:

  bin/bash with build id 26f0062cb6950d4d1ab0fd9c43eae8b10ca42062 not found, continuing without symbols

It happens because code added by 5baecbcd9c9a opens files directly by
dso->long_name without symbol_conf.symfs consideration, which as result
picks one from the host. It reads its build ID and later even code finds
another proper file in directory pointed by --symfs perf ignores it
because build id mismatches.

Fix is to use __symbol__join_symfs to adjust file name according to
--symfs setting. If no --symfs passed the operation would noop and picks
the same host file as before.

Also note in latter tree after 5baecbcd9c9a commit additional check for
'!dso->has_build_id' was added, so to observe error condition 'perf
record' should run with --no-buildid, so perf.data itself would not have
build id for target binary in buildid perf section and 'perf report'
will pass '!dso->has_build_id' condition. Or target binary should not
have build id, but the same binary on host has build id, again
'!dso->has_build_id' will pass in this case and incorrect build id could
be read if --symfs is used.
