PM / devfreq: Modify the device name as devfreq(X) for sysfs

This patch modifies the device name as devfreq(X) for sysfs by using the 'devfreq'
prefix word instead of separate device name. On user-space aspect, user would
find the some devfreq drvier with 'devfreq(X)' pattern. So, this patch modify the
device name as following:
- /sys/class/devfreq/[non-standard device name] -> /sys/class/devfreq/devfreq(X)
