iwlwifi: mvm: fix D3 replay counter value

This fixes a long-standing bug that was introduced when this code
was introduced: cfg80211 passes a pointer, but we treat it as if
it was passing a value. The result is that we pass the pointer to
the firmware, instead of the value. It's not clear how this could
ever have worked, unless the firmware is ignoring this value.
