l2tp: fix duplicate session creation

l2tp_session_create() relies on its caller for checking for duplicate
sessions. This is racy since a session can be concurrently inserted
after the caller's verification.

Fix this by letting l2tp_session_create() verify sessions uniqueness
upon insertion. Callers need to be adapted to check for
l2tp_session_create()'s return code instead of calling
l2tp_session_find().

pppol2tp_connect() is a bit special because it has to work on existing
sessions (if they're not connected) or to create a new session if none
is found. When acting on a preexisting session, a reference must be
held or it could go away on us. So we have to use l2tp_session_get()
instead of l2tp_session_find() and drop the reference before exiting.
