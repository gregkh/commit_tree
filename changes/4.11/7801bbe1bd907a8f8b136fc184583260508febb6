KVM: MIPS/T&E: Implement CP0_EBase register

The CP0_EBase register is a standard feature of MIPS32r2, so we should
always have been implementing it properly. However the register value
was ignored and wasn't exposed to userland.

Fix the emulation of exceptions and interrupts to use the value stored
in guest CP0_EBase, and fix the masks so that the top 3 bits (rather
than the standard 2) are fixed, so that it is always in the guest KSeg0
segment.

Also add CP0_EBASE to the KVM one_reg interface so it can be accessed by
userland, also allowing the CPU number field to be written (which isn't
permitted by the guest).
