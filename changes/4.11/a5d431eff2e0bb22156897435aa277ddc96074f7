fscrypt: make fscrypt_operations.key_prefix a string

There was an unnecessary amount of complexity around requesting the
filesystem-specific key prefix.  It was unclear why; perhaps it was
envisioned that different instances of the same filesystem type could
use different key prefixes, or that key prefixes could be binary.
However, neither of those things were implemented or really make sense
at all.  So simplify the code by making key_prefix a const char *.
