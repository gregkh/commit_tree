arm64: ensure __raw_read_system_reg() is self-consistent

We recently discovered that __raw_read_system_reg() erroneously mapped
sysreg IDs to the wrong registers.

To ensure that we don't get hit by a similar issue in future, this patch
makes __raw_read_system_reg() use a macro for each case statement,
ensuring that each case reads the correct register.

To ensure that this patch hasn't introduced an issue, I've binary-diffed
the object files before and after this patch. No code or data sections
differ (though some debug section differ due to line numbering
changing).
