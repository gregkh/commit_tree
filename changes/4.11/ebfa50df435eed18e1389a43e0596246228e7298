powerpc: Add helper to check if offset is within relative branch range

To permit the use of relative branch instruction in powerpc, the target
address has to be relatively nearby, since the address is specified in an
immediate field (24 bit filed) in the instruction opcode itself. Here
nearby refers to 32MB on either side of the current instruction.

This patch verifies whether the target address is within +/- 32MB
range or not.
