perf tests: Synthesize struct instead of using field after variable sized type

End result is the same, its an ABI, so the struct won't change, avoid
using a GNU extension, so that we can catch other cases that may be bugs.

Caught when building with clang:

  tests/parse-no-sample-id-all.c:53:20: error: field 'attr' with variable sized type 'struct attr_event' not at the end of a struct or class is a GNU extension
        [-Werror,-Wgnu-variable-sized-type-not-at-end]
          struct attr_event attr;
                            ^
  1 error generated.

Testing it:

  # perf test sample_id
  24: Parse with no sample_id_all bit set        : Ok
