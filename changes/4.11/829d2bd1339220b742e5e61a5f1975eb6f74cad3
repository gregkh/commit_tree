arm64: entry-ftrace.S: avoid open-coded {adr,ldr}_l

Some places in the kernel open-code sequences using ADRP for a symbol
another instruction using a :lo12: relocation for that same symbol.
These sequences are easy to get wrong, and more painful to read than is
necessary. For these reasons, it is preferable to use the
{adr,ldr,str}_l macros for these cases.

This patch makes use of these in entry-ftrace.S, removing open-coded
sequences using adrp. This results in a minor code change, since a
temporary register is not used when generating the address for some
symbols, but this is fine, as the value of the temporary register is not
used elsewhere.
