gfs2: Avoid alignment hole in struct lm_lockname

Commit 88ffbf3e03 switches to using rhashtables for glocks, hashing over
the entire struct lm_lockname instead of its individual fields.  On some
architectures, struct lm_lockname contains a hole of uninitialized
memory due to alignment rules, which now leads to incorrect hash values.
Get rid of that hole.
