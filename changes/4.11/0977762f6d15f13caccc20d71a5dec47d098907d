md/r5cache: fix set_syndrome_sources() for data in cache

Before this patch, device InJournal will be included in prexor
(SYNDROME_SRC_WANT_DRAIN) but not in reconstruct (SYNDROME_SRC_WRITTEN). So it
will break parity calculation. With srctype == SYNDROME_SRC_WRITTEN, we need
include both dev with non-null ->written and dev with R5_InJournal. This fixes
logic in 1e6d690(md/r5cache: caching phase of r5cache)
