brcmfmac: allow wowlan support to be per device

The wowlan support is (partially) determined dynamic by checking the
device/firmware capabilities. So they can differ per device. So it
is not possible to use a static global. Instead use the global as a
template and use kmemdup(). When kmemdup() fails the template is used
unmodified.
