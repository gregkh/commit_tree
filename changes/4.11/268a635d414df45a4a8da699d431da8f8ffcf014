CIFS: add build_path_from_dentry_optional_prefix()

this function does the same thing as add build_path_from_dentry() but
takes a boolean parameter to decide whether or not to prefix the path
with the tree name.

we cannot rely on tcon->Flags & SMB_SHARE_IS_IN_DFS for SMB2 as smb2
code never sets tcon->Flags but it sets tcon->share_flags and it seems
the SMB_SHARE_IS_IN_DFS has different semantics in SMB2: the prefix
shouldn't be added everytime it was in SMB1.
