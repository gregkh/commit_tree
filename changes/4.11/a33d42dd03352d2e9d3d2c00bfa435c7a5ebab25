drm: Add a simple generator of random permutations

When testing, we want a random but yet reproducible order in which to
process elements. Here we create an array which is a random (using the
Tausworthe PRNG) permutation of the order in which to execute.

Note these are simple helpers intended to be merged upstream in lib/

v2: Tidier code by David Herrmann
v3: Add reminder that this code is intended to be temporary, with at
least the bulk of the prandom changes going to lib/
