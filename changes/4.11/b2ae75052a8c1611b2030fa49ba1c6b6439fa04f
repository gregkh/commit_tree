ide: Fix interface autodetection in legacy IDE driver (trial #2)

This humble patch was sent one or two months before, and had no actions,
except for a colleague reply which friendly pointed out some formatting
problems (which were solved in a second message).

It relates to an old code, the legacy IDE driver, but the bug it
addresses is real. The code, although rarely used, is
still there to be compiled if one chooses to do so (like me).

Also, the fix has a very low risk of present collateral effects IMHO.
It is already compiled and tested in some embedded machines.

So, again IMHO, it is worth be fixed.

This email is a second trial with it. I hope it can help the one or two
guys out there which are still running the legacy IDE driver and
haven't noticed the former email.
