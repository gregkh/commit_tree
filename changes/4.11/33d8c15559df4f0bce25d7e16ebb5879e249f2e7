Revert "clocksource/drivers/tcb_clksrc: Use 32 bit tcb as sched_clock"

This reverts commit 7b9f1d16e6d1 ("clocksource/drivers/tcb_clksrc: Use
32 bit tcb as sched_clock"). In the current state, the kernel warns
against a late registration of the new sched_clock, the printk clock
resets after only a few minutes, and it seems that scheduling can be
affected as well.
