HID: wacom: Don't add ghost interface as shared data

A previous commit (below) adds a check for already probed interfaces to
Wacom's matching heuristic. Unfortunately this causes the Bamboo Pen
(CTL-460) to match itself to its 'ghost' touch interface. After
subsequent changes to the driver this match to the ghost causes the
kernel to crash. This patch avoids calling wacom_add_shared_data()
for the BAMBOO_PEN's ghost touch interface.
