sh_eth: fix wakeup event reporting from MagicPacket

If a link change interrupt happens along side the MagicPacket interrupt
and the link change interrupt is ignored the interrupt handler will
return and the wakeup event is not registered. Fix this by moving the
MagicPacket check before the link change check.
