xen/acpi: upload PM state from init-domain to Xen

This was broken in commit cd979883b9ed ("xen/acpi-processor:
fix enabling interrupts on syscore_resume"). do_suspend (from
xen/manage.c) and thus xen_resume_notifier never get called on
the initial-domain at resume (it is if running as guest.)

The rationale for the breaking change was that upload_pm_data()
potentially does blocking work in syscore_resume(). This patch
addresses the original issue by scheduling upload_pm_data() to
execute in workqueue context.
