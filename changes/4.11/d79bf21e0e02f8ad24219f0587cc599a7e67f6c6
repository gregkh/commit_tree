vmlinux.lds: add missing VMLINUX_SYMBOL macros

When __{start,end}_ro_after_init is referenced from C code, we run into
the following build errors on blackfin:

  kernel/extable.c:169: undefined reference to `__start_ro_after_init'
  kernel/extable.c:169: undefined reference to `__end_ro_after_init'

The build error is due to the fact that blackfin is one of the few
arches that prepends an underscore '_' to all symbols defined in C.

Fix this by wrapping __{start,end}_ro_after_init in vmlinux.lds.h with
VMLINUX_SYMBOL(), which adds the necessary prefix for arches that have
HAVE_UNDERSCORE_SYMBOL_PREFIX.
