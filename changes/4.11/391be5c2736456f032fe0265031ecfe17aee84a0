bnxt_en: Implement new scheme to reserve tx rings.

In order to properly support TX rate limiting in SRIOV VF functions or
NPAR functions, firmware needs better control over tx ring allocations.
The new scheme requires the driver to reserve the number of tx rings
and to query to see if the requested number of tx rings is reserved.
The driver will use the new scheme when the firmware interface spec is
1.6.1 or newer.
