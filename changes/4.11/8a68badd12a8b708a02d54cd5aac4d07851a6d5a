i40evf: free rings in remove function

When the i40evf_remove() calls netdev close, the device doesn't actually
close - it schedules the work for the watchdog to perform. Since we're
stopping the watchdog, this work doesn't get done. However, we're
resetting the part, so we can free resources after the reset request has
gone through. This plugs a memory leak.
