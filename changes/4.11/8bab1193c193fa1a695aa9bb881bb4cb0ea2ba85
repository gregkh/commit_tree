drm/i915: Convert i915_ggtt_view to use an anonymous union

Reading the ggtt_views is much more pleasant without the extra
characters from specifying the union (i.e. ggtt_view.partial rather than
ggtt_view.params.partial). To make this work inside i915_vma_compare()
with only a single memcmp requires us to ensure that there are no
uninitialised bytes within each branch of the union (we make sure the
structs are packed) and we need to store the size of each branch.

v4: Rewrite changelog and add comments explaining the assert.
