net: dsa: add switch notifier

Add a notifier block per DSA switch, registered against a notifier head
in the switch fabric they belong to.

This infrastructure will allow to propagate fabric-wide events such as
port bridging, VLAN configuration, etc. If a DSA switch driver cares
about cross-chip configuration, such events can be caught.
