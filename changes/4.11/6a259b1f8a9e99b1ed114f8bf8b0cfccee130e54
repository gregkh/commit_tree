drm/i915: Initialize dev_priv->atomic_cdclk_freq at init time

Looks like we're only initializing dev_priv->atomic_cdclk_freq
at resume and commit times, not at init time. Let's do that as
well.

We're now hitting the 'WARN_ON(intel_state->cdclk == 0)' in
hsw_compute_linetime_wm() on account of populating
intel_state->cdclk from dev_priv->atomic_cdclk_freq.
Previously we were mispopulating intel_state->cdclk with
dev_priv->cdclk_freq which always had a proper value at init
time and hence the WARN_ON() didn't trigger.
