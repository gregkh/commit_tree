usb: musb: omap2430: constify dev_pm_ops structures

Declare dev_pm_ops structures as const as they are only stored in the pm
field of a device_driver structure. This field is of type const, so
dev_pm_ops structures having similar properties can be declared const
too.

Size details after cross compiling the .o file for arm
architecture.
