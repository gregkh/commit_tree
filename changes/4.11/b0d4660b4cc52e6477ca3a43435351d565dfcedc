net/mlx5e: Fix broken CQE compression initialization

Some of RQ type parameters are derived from CQE compression state flag,
CQE compression flag was initialized only after RQ type parameters
setup. This leads to load RQ with stride size smaller than what we
want for when CQE compression is on.

This bug introduces no functional damage, it only makes CQE compression
occur less often, since in ConnectX4-LX CQE compression is performed
only on packets smaller than stride size.

Fix this by marking default status of CQE compression in PFLAG prior to
calling mlx5e_set_rq_priv_params(), as it inits some fields based on it.

Tested:
 load driver on systems where rx CQE compress will be on (MH)
 pktgen with  64 < pkt size < 256 and netperf TCP_STREAM (IPv4/IPv6)
 verify `ethtool -S ethxx | grep compress` are advancing more often
 (rapidly)
