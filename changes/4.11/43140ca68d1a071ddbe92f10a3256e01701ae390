scsi: lpfc: Rename LPFC_MAX_EQ_DELAY to LPFC_MAX_EQ_DELAY_EQID_CNT

Without apriori understanding of what the define is, the name gives
a very different impression of what it is (a max delay value
for an EQ).  Rename the define so it reflects what it is: the number
of EQ IDs that can be set in one instance of the MODIFY_EQ_DELAY
mbx command.
