sched/headers: Remove <linux/sched.h> from <linux/sched/cpufreq.h>

Make the <linux/sched/cpufreq.h> file a self-contained header and
remove the <linux/sched.h> dependency: users of it either don't
need <linux/sched.h> - or have already included it.

This reduces the size of the header dependency graph.
