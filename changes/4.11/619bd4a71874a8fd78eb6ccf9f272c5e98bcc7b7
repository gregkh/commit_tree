sched/rt: Add a missing rescheduling point

Since the change in commit:

  fd7a4bed1835 ("sched, rt: Convert switched_{from, to}_rt() / prio_changed_rt() to balance callbacks")

... we don't reschedule a task under certain circumstances:

Lets say task-A, SCHED_OTHER, is running on CPU0 (and it may run only on
CPU0) and holds a PI lock. This task is removed from the CPU because it
used up its time slice and another SCHED_OTHER task is running. Task-B on
CPU1 runs at RT priority and asks for the lock owned by task-A. This
results in a priority boost for task-A. Task-B goes to sleep until the
lock has been made available. Task-A is already runnable (but not active),
so it receives no wake up.

The reality now is that task-A gets on the CPU once the scheduler decides
to remove the current task despite the fact that a high priority task is
enqueued and waiting. This may take a long time.

The desired behaviour is that CPU0 immediately reschedules after the
priority boost which made task-A the task with the lowest priority.
