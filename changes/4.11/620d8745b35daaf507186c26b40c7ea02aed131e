Introduce cifs_copy_file_range()

The earlier changes to copy range for cifs unintentionally disabled the more
common form of server side copy.

The patch introduces the file_operations helper cifs_copy_file_range()
which is used by the syscall copy_file_range. The new file operations
helper allows us to perform server side copies for SMB2.0 and 2.1
servers as well as SMB 3.0+ servers which do not support the ioctl
FSCTL_DUPLICATE_EXTENTS_TO_FILE.

The new helper uses the ioctl FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK_WRITE to perform
server side copies. The helper is called by vfs_copy_file_range() only
once an attempt to clone the file using the ioctl
FSCTL_DUPLICATE_EXTENTS_TO_FILE has failed.
