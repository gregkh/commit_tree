power: supply: axp20x_usb_power: add 100mA max current limit for AXP223

The X-Powers AXP223 shares most of its behaviour with the AXP221 PMIC
but allows the VBUS power supply max current to be set to 100mA (like
the AXP209 PMIC).

This basically adds a new compatible to the VBUS power supply driver and
adds a check on the compatible when setting current max limit.
