l2tp: take reference on sessions being dumped

Take a reference on the sessions returned by l2tp_session_find_nth()
(and rename it l2tp_session_get_nth() to reflect this change), so that
caller is assured that the session isn't going to disappear while
processing it.

For procfs and debugfs handlers, the session is held in the .start()
callback and dropped in .show(). Given that pppol2tp_seq_session_show()
dereferences the associated PPPoL2TP socket and that
l2tp_dfs_seq_session_show() might call pppol2tp_show(), we also need to
call the session's .ref() callback to prevent the socket from going
away from under us.
