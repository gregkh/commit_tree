cdrom: Make device operations read-only

Since function tables are a common target for attackers, it's best to keep
them in read-only memory. As such, this makes the CDROM device ops tables
const. This drops additionally n_minors, since it isn't used meaningfully,
and sets the only user of cdrom_dummy_generic_packet explicitly so the
variables can all be const.

Inspired by similar changes in grsecurity/PaX.
