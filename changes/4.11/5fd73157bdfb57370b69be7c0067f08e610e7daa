sched/headers: Remove <linux/sched.h> from <linux/sched/autogroup.h>

The <linux/sched/autogroup.h> file is a largely self-contained header and users of
it either don't need <linux/sched.h> - or have already included it.

Add a 'task_struct' predeclaration to make it build standalone.

This reduces the size of the header dependency graph.
