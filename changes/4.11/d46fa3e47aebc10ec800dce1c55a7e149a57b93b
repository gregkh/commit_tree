rtlwifi: btcoexist: Change logging in halbtc8192e2ant.c

This routine uses its own debugging macros These are changed to use the
the recently rewritten RT_TRACE macro. There are also some renamed
variables that were missed in the previous step.

The only functional change is that some debugging statements have been
dropped based on the final code supplied by Realtek.
