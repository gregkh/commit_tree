tracing: Have traceprobe_probes_write() not access userspace unnecessarily

The code in traceprobe_probes_write() reads up to 4096 bytes from userpace
for each line. If userspace passes in several lines to execute, the code
will do a large read for each line, even though, it is highly likely that
the first read from userspace received all of the lines at once.

I changed the logic to do a single read from userspace, and to only read
from userspace again if not all of the read from userspace made it in.

I tested this by adding printk()s and writing files that would test -1, ==,
and +1 the buffer size, to make sure that there's no overflows and that if a
single line is written with +1 the buffer size, that it fails properly.
