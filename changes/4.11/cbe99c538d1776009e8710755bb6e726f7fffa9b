leds: ktd2692: avoid harmless maybe-uninitialized warning

gcc gets confused about the control flow in ktd2692_parse_dt(), causing
it to warn about what seems like a potential bug:

drivers/leds/leds-ktd2692.c: In function 'ktd2692_probe':
drivers/leds/leds-ktd2692.c:244:15: error: '*((void *)&led_cfg+8)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/leds/leds-ktd2692.c:225:7: error: 'led_cfg.flash_max_microamp' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/leds/leds-ktd2692.c:232:3: error: 'led_cfg.movie_max_microamp' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The code is fine, and slightly reworking it in an equivalent way lets
gcc figure that out too, which gets rid of the warning.
