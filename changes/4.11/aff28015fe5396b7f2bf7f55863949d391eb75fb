mm, trace: extract COMPACTION_STATUS and ZONE_TYPE to a common header

COMPACTION_STATUS resp. ZONE_TYPE are currently used to translate enum
compact_result resp.  struct zone index into their symbolic names for an
easier post processing.  The follow up patch would like to reuse this as
well.  The code involves some preprocessor black magic which is better not
duplicated elsewhere so move it to a common mm tracing relate header.
