serial: 8250_EXAR: fix duplicate Kconfig text and add missing help text

In commit d0aeaa83f0b0f7a92615bbdd6b1f96812f7dcfd2 ("serial: exar:
split out the exar code from 8250_pci") the exar driver got its own
Kconfig.  However the text for the new option was never changed from
the original 8250_PCI text, and hence it appears confusing when you
get asked the same question twice:

  8250/16550 PCI device support (SERIAL_8250_PCI) [Y/n/m/?] (NEW)
    8250/16550 PCI device support (SERIAL_8250_EXAR) [Y/n/m] (NEW)

Adding to the confusion, is that there is no help text for this new
option to indicate it is specific to a certain family of cards.

Fix both issues at the same time, as well as the space vs. tab issues
introduced in the same commit.
