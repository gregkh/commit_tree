mmc: block: return errorcode from mmc_sd_num_wr_blocks()

mmc_sd_num_wr_blocks() has an interesting construction that
saves one return argument by casting (u32)-1 as error code
if something goes wrong.

This is however a bit confusing when the normal kernel
pattern is to return an int error code on success.

So instead pass a variable "blocks" that the function can
fill in with the number of successfully transferred blocks
and return an integer as error code.
