cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix policy data management in passive mode

The policy->cpuinfo.max_freq and policy->max updates in
intel_cpufreq_turbo_update() are excessive as they are done for no
good reason and may lead to problems in principle, so they should be
dropped.  However, after dropping them intel_cpufreq_turbo_update()
becomes almost entirely pointless, because the check made by it is
made again down the road in intel_pstate_prepare_request().  The
only thing in it that still needs to be done is the call to
update_turbo_state(), so drop intel_cpufreq_turbo_update() altogether
and make its callers invoke update_turbo_state() directly instead of
it.

In addition to that, fix intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() so that it
checks global.no_turbo in addition to global.turbo_disabled when
updating policy->cpuinfo.max_freq to make it consistent with
intel_pstate_verify_policy().
