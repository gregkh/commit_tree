PM / core / docs: Convert sleep states API document to reST

Move the document describing the system sleep state transitions API
for devices to Documentation/driver-api/pm/, convert it to reST and
update it to use current terminology.  Also remove the remaining
reference to the old version of it from pm.h.

The new document still contains references to some documents in the
.txt format that will be converted later.
