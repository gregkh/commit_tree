lightnvm: use end_io callback instead of instance

When the lightnvm core had the "gennvm" layer between the device and the
target, there was a need for the core to be able to figure out which
target it should send an end_io callback to. Leading to a "double"
end_io, first for the media manager instance, and then for the target
instance. Now that core and gennvm is merged, there is no longer a need
for this, and a single end_io callback will do.
