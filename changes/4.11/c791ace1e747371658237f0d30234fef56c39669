mm: replace FAULT_FLAG_SIZE with parameter to huge_fault

Since the introduction of FAULT_FLAG_SIZE to the vm_fault flag, it has
been somewhat painful with getting the flags set and removed at the
correct locations.  More than one kernel oops was introduced due to
difficulties of getting the placement correctly.

Remove the flag values and introduce an input parameter to huge_fault
that indicates the size of the page entry.  This makes the code easier
to trace and should avoid the issues we see with the fault flags where
removal of the flag was necessary in the fallback paths.
