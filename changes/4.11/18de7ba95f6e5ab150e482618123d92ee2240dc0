net: thunderx: Fix LMAC mode debug prints for QSGMII mode

When BGX/LMACs are in QSGMII mode, for some LMACs, mode info is
not being printed. This patch will fix that. With changes already
done to not do any sort of serdes 2 lane mapping config calculation
in kernel driver, we can get rid of this logic.
