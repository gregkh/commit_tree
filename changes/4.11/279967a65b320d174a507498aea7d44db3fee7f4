HID: rmi: Handle all Synaptics touchpads using hid-rmi

With the addition of HID and F12 support in the synaptics-rmi4 driver
touchpads which had been using the hid-multitouch driver can now
be support by the synaptics-rmi4 via hid-rmi. The advantage is that
additional data can be reported from the RMI registers which is not
available in the Microsoft Precision Touchpad collection.
