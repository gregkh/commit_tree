regulator: core: remove dead code in _regulator_get()

There is no point in assigning value to 'ret' before calling
regulator_dev_lookup() as it will clobber 'ret' anyway.

Also, let's explicitly return -PROBE_DEFER when try_module_get() fails,
instead of relying that earlier initialization of "regulator" carries
correct value.
