w1: add DS2405 addressable switch driver

This adds a driver for a DS2405 1-wire single-channel addressable switch.
The DS2405 can also work as a single-channel binary remote sensor.

This driver supports two attributes: "state" and "output" which are the
same attribute names as supported by existing DS2406, DS2408 and DS2413
drivers.
