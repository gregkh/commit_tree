tipc: add function for checking broadcast support in bearer

As a preparation for the 'replicast' functionality we are going to
introduce in the next commits, we need the broadcast base structure to
store whether bearer broadcast is available at all from the currently
used bearer or bearers.

We do this by adding a new function tipc_bearer_bcast_support() to
the bearer layer, and letting the bearer selection function in
bcast.c use this to give a new boolean field, 'bcast_support' the
appropriate value.
