memblock: let memblock_type_name know about physmem type

Since commit 70210ed950b5 ("mm/memblock: add physical memory list") the
memblock structure knows about a physical memory list.

memblock_type_name() should return "physmem" instead of "unknown" if the
name of the physmem memblock_type is being asked for.
