scsi: megaraid_sas: SAS3.5 Generic Megaraid Controllers Stream Detection and IO Coalescing

Detect sequential Write IOs and pass the hint that it is part of sequential
stream to help HBA Firmware do the Full Stripe Writes. For read IOs on
certain RAID volumes like Read Ahead volumes,this will help driver to
send it to Firmware even if the IOs can potentially be sent to
hardware directly (called fast path) bypassing firmware.

Design: 8 streams are maintained per RAID volume as per the combined
firmware/driver design. When there is no stream detected the LRU stream
is used for next potential stream and LRU/MRU map is updated to make this
as MRU stream. Every time a stream is detected the MRU map
is updated to make the current stream as MRU stream.
