drm/prime: Clarify DMA-BUF/GEM Object lifetime

From the description of the "DMA-BUF/GEM Object references
and lifetime overview" it is not clear when exactly
dma_buf gets destroyed and memory freed: only driver
.release function mentioned which makes confusion on the
real buffer's lifetime.

Add more description so all the paths are covered.
