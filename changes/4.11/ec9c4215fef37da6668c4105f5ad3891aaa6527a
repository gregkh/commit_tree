ipv6: fix source routing

Commit a149e7c7ce81 ("ipv6: sr: add support for SRH injection through
setsockopt") introduced handling of IPV6_SRCRT_TYPE_4, but at the same
time restricted it to only IPV6_SRCRT_TYPE_0 and
IPV6_SRCRT_TYPE_4. Previously, ipv6_push_exthdr() and fl6_update_dst()
would also handle other values (ie STRICT and TYPE_2).

Restore previous source routing behavior, by handling IPV6_SRCRT_STRICT
and IPV6_SRCRT_TYPE_2 the same way as IPV6_SRCRT_TYPE_0 in
ipv6_push_exthdr() and fl6_update_dst().
