xfrm: Don't use sk_family for socket policy lookups

On IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses sk_family is AF_INET6,
but the flow informations are created based on AF_INET.
So the routing set up 'struct flowi4' but we try to
access 'struct flowi6' what leads to an out of bounds
access. Fix this by using the family we get with the
dst_entry, like we do it for the standard policy lookup.
