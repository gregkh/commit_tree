ARM: dts: keystone-k2e: Reserve MSM RAM for boot monitor

The Keystone 2 boot monitor uses 32 KB of the MSM RAM @ 0x0c1f0000
on 66AK2E SoCs, so add a reserved child node for the same.

This address is aligned to the values used within the latest boot
monitor firmware [1] as of commit cf8b431e8b3b ("soc: Move load
address to end of MSMC").
