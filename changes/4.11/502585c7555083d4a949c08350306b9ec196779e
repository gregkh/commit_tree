h8300/ptrace: Fix incorrect register transfer count

regs_set() and regs_get() are vulnerable to an off-by-1 buffer overrun
if CONFIG_CPU_H8S is set, since this adds an extra entry to
register_offset[] but not to user_regs_struct.

So, iterate over user_regs_struct based on its actual size, not based on
the length of register_offset[].
