afs: Deal with an empty callback array

Servers may send a callback array that is the same size as
the FID array, or an empty array.  If the callback count is
0, the code would attempt to read (fid_count * 12) bytes of
data, which would fail and result in an unmarshalling error.
This would lead to stale data for remotely modified files
or directories.

Store the callback array size in the internal afs_call
structure and use that to determine the amount of data to
read.
