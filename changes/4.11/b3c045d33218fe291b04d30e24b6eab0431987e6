KVM: lapic: remove unnecessary KVM_REQ_EVENT on PPR update

PPR needs to be updated whenever on every IRR read because we
may have missed TPR writes that _increased_ PPR.  However, these
writes need not generate KVM_REQ_EVENT, because either KVM_REQ_EVENT
has been set already in __apic_accept_irq, or we are going to
process the interrupt right away.
