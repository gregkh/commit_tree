pinctrl: cherryview: Add a quirk to make Acer Chromebook keyboard work again

After commit 47c950d10202 ("pinctrl: cherryview: Do not add all
southwest and north GPIOs to IRQ domain") the driver does not add all
GPIOs to the irqdomain. The reason for that is that those GPIOs cannot
generate IRQs at all, only GPEs (General Purpose Events). This causes
Linux virtual IRQ numbering to change.

However, it seems some CYAN Chromebooks, including Acer Chromebook
hardcodes these Linux IRQ numbers in the ACPI tables of the machine.
Since the numbering is different now, the IRQ meant for keyboard does
not match the Linux virtual IRQ number anymore making the keyboard
non-functional.

Work this around by adding special quirk just for these machines where
we add back all GPIOs to the irqdomain. Rest of the Cherryview/Braswell
based machines will not be affected by the change.
