mlxsw: spectrum_router: Use trap action only for some route types

The device can have one of three actions associated with a route:

1) Remote - packets continue to the adjacency table
2) Local - packets continue to the neighbour table
3) Trap - packets continue to the CPU

The first two actions can also trap packets to the CPU, but they do so
using a different trap ID, which has a lower traffic class and less
allotted bandwidth.

We currently use the third action for both RTN_{LOCAL,BROADCAST} routes
and RTN_UNICAST routes not pointing to the switch ports.

However, packets that merely need to be forwarded by the switch are
likely not control packets and can be therefore scheduled towards the
CPU using a lower traffic class.

Achieve the above by assigning the third action only to local and
broadcast routes and have any other route use either of the first two
actions, based on whether the route is gatewayed or not.

This will also allow us to refresh routes using the local action and
have them trap packets when their RIF is no longer valid following a
NH_DEL event.

One side effect of this patch is that we no longer give special
treatment to multipath routes using both switch and non-switch ports
towards their nexthops. If at least one of the nexthops can be resolved,
then the device will forward the packets instead of trapping them.
