bpf: fix struct htab_elem layout

when htab_elem is removed from the bucket list the htab_elem.hash_node.next
field should not be overridden too early otherwise we have a tiny race window
between lookup and delete.
The bug was discovered by manual code analysis and reproducible
only with explicit udelay() in lookup_elem_raw().
