netfilter: nfnl_cthelper: fix incorrect helper->expect_class_max

The helper->expect_class_max must be set to the total number of
expect_policy minus 1, since we will use the statement "if (class >
helper->expect_class_max)" to validate the CTA_EXPECT_CLASS attr in
ctnetlink_alloc_expect.

So for compatibility, set the helper->expect_class_max to the
NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM attr's value minus 1.

Also: it's invalid when the NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM attr's value is zero.
1. this will result "expect_policy = kzalloc(0, GFP_KERNEL);";
2. we cannot set the helper->expect_class_max to a proper value.

So if nla_get_be32(tb[NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM]) is zero, report -EINVAL to
the userspace.
