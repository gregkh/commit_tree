kvm: nVMX: Prepare for checkpointing L2 state

Split prepare_vmcs12 into two parts: the part that stores the current L2
guest state and the part that sets up the exit information fields. The
former will be used when checkpointing the vCPU's VMX state.

Modify prepare_vmcs02 so that it can construct a vmcs02 midway through
L2 execution, using the checkpointed L2 guest state saved into the
cached vmcs12 above.

[Rebasing: add from_vmentry argument to prepare_vmcs02 instead of using
 vmx->nested.nested_run_pending, because it is no longer 1 at the
 point prepare_vmcs02 is called. - Paolo]
