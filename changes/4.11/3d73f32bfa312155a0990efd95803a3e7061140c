serial: sh-sci: Don't rely on platform data flags when not needed

The UPF_BOOT_AUTOCONF platform data flag is set by all platforms,
hardcode it.

The UPF_IOREMAP flag is set by a single SH platform and thus needs to be
kept. However, for ARM platforms, we can base the decision on whether an
OF node is present and bypass the platform data flags completely.
