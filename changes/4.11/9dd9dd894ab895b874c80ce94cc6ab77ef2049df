clk: rockchip: use clock ids for memory controller parts on rk3066/rk3188

Add the newly added clock ids to the clock entries of the rk3066/rk3188
clock driver. We won't be needing them in the kernel for a bit yet
but as they're used in the new u-boot ddr setup code/dts we should make
sure the clock ids stay identical and do not differ.
