MIPS: Check TLB before handle_ri_rdhwr() for Loongson-3

Loongson-3's micro TLB (ITLB) is not strictly a subset of JTLB. That
means: when a JTLB entry is replaced by hardware, there may be an old
valid entry exists in ITLB. So, a TLB miss exception may occur while
handle_ri_rdhwr() is running because it try to access EPC's content.
However, handle_ri_rdhwr() doesn't clear EXL, which makes a TLB Refill
exception be treated as a TLB Invalid exception and tlbp may fail. In
this case, if FTLB (which is usually set-associative instead of set-
associative) is enabled, a tlbp failure will cause an invalid tlbwi,
which will hang the whole system.

This patch rename handle_ri_rdhwr_vivt to handle_ri_rdhwr_tlbp and use
it for Loongson-3. It try to solve the same problem described as below,
but more straightforwards.

I think Loongson-2 has the same problem, but it has no FTLB, so we just
keep it as is.
