hwmon: (tmp401) use smb word operations instead of 2 smb byte operations

tmp401 separately read/wrote high and low bytes of temperature values while
the hardware supports reading/writing those values in one operation. Driver
has been modified to use word operations where possible.

Tested with a tmp432 sensor on a mips64 platform.
