nbd: handle ERESTARTSYS properly

We can submit IO in a processes context, which means there can be
pending signals.  This isn't a fatal error for NBD, but it does require
some finesse.  If the signal happens before we transmit anything then we
are ok, just requeue the request and carry on.  However if we've done a
partial transmit we can't allow anything else to be transmitted on this
socket until we transmit the remaining part of the request.  Deal with
this by keeping track of how much we've sent for the current request,
and if we get an ERESTARTSYS during any part of our transmission save
the state of that request and requeue the IO.  If anybody tries to
submit a request that isn't our pending request then requeue that
request until we are able to service the one that is pending.
