cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix limits issue with operation mode switching

There is a problem with intel_pstate operation mode switching
introduced by commit fb1fe1041c04 (cpufreq: intel_pstate: Operation
mode control from sysfs), because the global sysfs limits are
preserved across operation modes while per-policy limits are
reinitialized from scratch on a mode switch and both sets of limits
may get out of sync this way.

Fix that by always reinitializing the global limits upon the
registration of the driver.
