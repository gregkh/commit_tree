workqueue: trigger WARN if queue_delayed_work() is called with NULL @wq

If queue_delayed_work() gets called with NULL @wq, the kernel will
oops asynchronuosly on timer expiration which isn't too helpful in
tracking down the offender.  This actually happened with smc.

__queue_delayed_work() already does several input sanity checks
synchronously.  Add NULL @wq check.
