serial: sh-sci: consider DR (data ready) bit adequately

To allow operation with a higher RX FIFO interrupt threshold in PIO
mode, it is necessary to consider the DR bit ("FIFO not full, but no
data received for 1.5 frames") as an indicator that data can be read.
Otherwise the driver will let data rot in the FIFO until the threshold
is reached.
