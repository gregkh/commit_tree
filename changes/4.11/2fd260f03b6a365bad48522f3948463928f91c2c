PCI/AER: Remove unused .link_reset() callback

No hardware seems to actually call .link_reset(), and no driver implements
it as more than a nop stub.

Drop mentions of the callback from everywhere.  It's dropped from the
documentation as well, but the doc really needs to be updated to reflect
reality better (e.g., on PCIe, slot reset is the link reset).  This will be
done in a later patch.
