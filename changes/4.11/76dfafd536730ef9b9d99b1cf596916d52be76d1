KVM: x86: do not scan IRR twice on APICv vmentry

Calls to apic_find_highest_irr are scanning IRR twice, once
in vmx_sync_pir_from_irr and once in apic_search_irr.  Change
sync_pir_from_irr to get the new maximum IRR from kvm_apic_update_irr;
now that it does the computation, it can also do the RVI write.

In order to avoid complications in svm.c, make the callback optional.
