powerpc: Update to new option-vector-5 format for CAS

On POWER9 the ibm,client-architecture-support (CAS) negotiation process
has been updated to change how the host to guest negotiation is done for
the new hash/radix mmu as well as the nest mmu, process tables and guest
translation shootdown (GTSE).

This is documented in the unreleased PAPR ACR "CAS option vector
additions for P9".

The host tells the guest which options it supports in
ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support. The guest then chooses a subset of these
to request in the CAS call and these are agreed to in the
ibm,architecture-vec-5 property of the chosen node.

Thus we read ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support and make our selection before
calling CAS. We then parse the ibm,architecture-vec-5 property of the
chosen node to check whether we should run as hash or radix.

ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support format:

index value pairs: <index, val> ... <index, val>

index: Option vector 5 byte number
val:   Some representation of supported values
