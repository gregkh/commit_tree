ath9k: use correct OTP register offsets for the AR9340 and AR9550

This patch fixes the OTP register definitions for the AR934x and AR9550
WMAC SoC.

Previously, the ath9k driver was unable to initialize the integrated
WMAC on an Aerohive AP121:

| ath: phy0: timeout (1000 us) on reg 0x30018: 0xbadc0ffe & 0x00000007 != 0x00000004
| ath: phy0: timeout (1000 us) on reg 0x30018: 0xbadc0ffe & 0x00000007 != 0x00000004
| ath: phy0: Unable to initialize hardware; initialization status: -5
| ath9k ar934x_wmac: failed to initialize device
| ath9k: probe of ar934x_wmac failed with error -5

It turns out that the AR9300_OTP_STATUS and AR9300_OTP_DATA
definitions contain a typo.
