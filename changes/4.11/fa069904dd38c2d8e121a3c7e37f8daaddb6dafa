cgroup: separate out cgroup1_kf_syscall_ops

Currently, cgroup_kf_syscall_ops is shared by v1 and v2 and the
specific methods test the version and take different actions.  Split
out v1 functions and put them in cgroup1_kf_syscall_ops and remove the
now unnecessary explicit branches in specific methods.
