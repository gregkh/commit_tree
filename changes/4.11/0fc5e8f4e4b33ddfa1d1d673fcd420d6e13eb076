ACPICA: Hardware: Add sleep register hooks

ACPICA commit ba665dc8e20d9f7730466a659564dd6c557a6cbc

In Linux, para-virtualization implmentation hooks critical register
writes to prevent real hardware operations. This increases divergences
when the sleep registers are cracked in Linux resident ACPICA.

This patch tries to introduce a single OSL to reduce the divergences.
