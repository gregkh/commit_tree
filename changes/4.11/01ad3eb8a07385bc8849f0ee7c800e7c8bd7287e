ovl: concurrent copy up of regular files

Now that copy up of regular file is done using O_TMPFILE,
we don't need to hold rename_lock throughout copy up.

Use the copy up waitqueue to synchronize concurrent copy up
of the same file. Different regular files can be copied up
concurrently.

The upper dir inode_lock is taken instead of rename_lock,
because it is needed for lookup and later for linking the
temp file, but it is released while copying up data.
