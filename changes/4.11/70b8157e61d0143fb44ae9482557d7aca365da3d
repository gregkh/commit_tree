sched/headers: Move <asm/current.h> include from the middle of <linux/sched.h> to the header portion

Linux-0.01 already defined 'current' in the middle of sched.h, so this
is an ancient historical precedent - but still in a modern kernel it
looks a bit weird that we have:

	#include <asm/current.h>

in the middle of the header.

Move it further up. If this was done for some obscure dependency
reasons then we'll trigger and document it.
