f2fs: put allocate_segment after refresh_sit_entry

SIT information should be updated before segment allocation, since SSR needs
latest valid block information. Current code does not update the old_blkaddr
info in sit_entry, so adjust the allocate_segment to its proper location. Commit
5e443818fa0b2a2845561ee25bec181424fb2889 ("f2fs: handle dirty segments inside
refresh_sit_entry") puts it into wrong location.
