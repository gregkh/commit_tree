dm raid: bump the target version

This version bump reflects that the reshape corruption fix (commit
92a39f6cc "dm raid: fix data corruption on reshape request") is
present.

Done as a separate fix because the above referenced commit is marked for
stable and target version bumps in a stable@ fix are a recipe for the
fix to never get backported to stable@ kernels (because of target
version number conflicts).

Also, move RESUME_STAY_FROZEN_FLAGS up with the reset the the _FLAGS
definitions now that we don't need to worry about stable@ conflicts as a
result of missing context.
