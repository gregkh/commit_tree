usb: chipidea: Add platform flag for wrapper phy management

The ULPI phy on qcom platforms needs to be initialized and
powered on after a USB reset and before we toggle the run/stop
bit. Otherwise, the phy locks up and doesn't work properly.
Therefore, add a flag to skip any phy power management in the
core layer, leaving it up to the glue driver to manage.
