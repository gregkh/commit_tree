jump_label: Add comment about initialization order for anonymous unions

Commit 3821fd35b58d ("jump_label: Reduce the size of struct static_key")
broke old compilers that could not handle static initialization of anonymous
unions. Boris fixed it with a patch that added brackets around the static
initializer. But this creates a dependency between those initializers and
the structure's order of its fields. Document this dependency in case new
fields are added to struct static_key in the future.
