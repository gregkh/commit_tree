ath10k: prevent sta pointer rcu violation

Station pointers are RCU protected so driver must
be extra careful if it tries to store them
internally for later use outside of the RCU
section it obtained it in.

It was possible for station teardown to race with
some htt events. The possible outcome could be a
use-after-free and a crash.

Only peer-flow-control capable firmware was
affected (so hardware-wise qca99x0 and qca4019).

This could be done in sta_state() itself via
explicit synchronize_net() call but there's
already a convenient sta_pre_rcu_remove() op that
can be hooked up to avoid extra rcu stall.

The peer->sta pointer itself can't be set to
NULL/ERR_PTR because it is later used in
sta_state() for extra sanity checks.
