blk-merge: return the merged request

When we attempt to merge request-to-request, we return a 0/1 if we
ended up merging or not. Change that to return the pointer to the
request that we freed. We will use this to move the freeing of
that request out of the merge logic, so that callers can drop
locks before freeing the request.

There should be no functional changes in this patch.
