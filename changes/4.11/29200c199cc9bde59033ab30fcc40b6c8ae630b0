bpf: test for AND edge cases

These two tests are based on the work done for f23cc643f9ba.  The first test is
just a basic one to make sure we don't allow AND'ing negative values, even if it
would result in a valid index for the array.  The second is a cleaned up version
of the original testcase provided by Jann Horn that resulted in the commit.
