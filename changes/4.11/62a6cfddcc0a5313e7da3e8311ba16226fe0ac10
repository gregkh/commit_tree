cifs: Do not send echoes before Negotiate is complete

commit 4fcd1813e640 ("Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect
long after socket reconnect") added support for Negotiate requests to
be initiated by echo calls.

To avoid delays in calling echo after a reconnect, I added the patch
introduced by the commit b8c600120fc8 ("Call echo service immediately
after socket reconnect").

This has however caused a regression with cifs shares which do not have
support for echo calls to trigger Negotiate requests. On connections
which need to call Negotiation, the echo calls trigger an error which
triggers a reconnect which in turn triggers another echo call. This
results in a loop which is only broken when an operation is performed on
the cifs share. For an idle share, it can DOS a server.

The patch uses the smb_operation can_echo() for cifs so that it is
called only if connection has been already been setup.
