statx: correct error handling of NULL pathname

The change in commit 1e2f82d1e9d1 ("statx: Kill fd-with-NULL-path
support in favour of AT_EMPTY_PATH") to error on a NULL pathname to
statx() is inconsistent.

It results in the error EINVAL for a NULL pathname.  Other system calls
with similar APIs (fchownat(), fstatat(), linkat()), return EFAULT.

The solution is simply to remove the EINVAL check.  As I already pointed
out in [1], user_path_at*() and filename_lookup() will handle the NULL
pathname as per the other APIs, to correctly produce the error EFAULT.
