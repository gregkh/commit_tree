xfs: reject all unaligned direct writes to reflinked files

We currently fall back from direct to buffered writes if we detect a
remaining shared extent in the iomap_begin callback.  But by the time
iomap_begin is called for the potentially unaligned end block we might
have already written most of the data to disk, which we'd now write
again using buffered I/O.  To avoid this reject all writes to reflinked
files before starting I/O so that we are guaranteed to only write the
data once.

The alternative would be to unshare the unaligned start and/or end block
before doing the I/O. I think that's doable, and will actually be
required to support reflinks on DAX file system.  But it will take a
little more time and I'd rather get rid of the double write ASAP.
