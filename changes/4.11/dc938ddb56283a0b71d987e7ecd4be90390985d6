ASoC: samsung: i2s: Ensure proper runtime PM state of I2S device

This patch adds calls to pm_runtime_get/put to ensure that any access to
I2S registers is done with proper (active) runtime PM state of I2S device.
Till now the driver enabled runtime PM, but didn't manage the state during
driver operation. The driver worked fine only because the runtime PM
callbacks managed device clock, which was enabled all the time because of
the additional enable call in the driver's probe function.
