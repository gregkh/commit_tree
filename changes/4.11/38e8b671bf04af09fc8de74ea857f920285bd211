RDMA/hfi1: Avoid redeclaration error

Move hfi1 ioctl definitions to a new header which can be included by
both the hfi1 and qib drivers to avoid a duplicate enum definition
as shown in this build error for qib:

  CC [M] drivers/infiniband/hw/qib/qib_sysfs.o
In file included from ./include/uapi/rdma/rdma_user_ioctl.h:39:0,
		 from include/uapi/rdma/ib_user_mad.h:38,
		 from include/rdma/ib_mad.h:43,
		 from include/rdma/ib_pma.h:38,
		 from drivers/infiniband/hw/qib/qib_mad.h:37,
		 from drivers/infiniband/hw/qib/qib_init.c:49:
./include/uapi/rdma/hfi/hfi1_user.h:370:2: error: redeclaration of
enumerator ‘ur_rcvhdrtail’
  ur_rcvhdrtail = 0,

Move hfi1 structures to separate file to avoid this failure.

The actual move of the ioctl definitions comes in a follow on patch.
