userfaultfd: non-cooperative: add ability to report non-PF events from uffd descriptor

The custom events are queued in ctx->event_wqh not to disturb the
fast-path-ed PF queue-wait-wakeup functions.

The events to be generated (other than PF-s) are requested in UFFD_API
ioctl with the uffd_api.features bits. Those, known by the kernel, are
then turned on and reported back to the user-space.
