[media] rc: ir-rc5-decoder: Add encode capability

Add the capability to encode RC-5, RC-5X and RC-5-SZ scancodes as raw
events.

The Manchester modulation helper is used, and for RC-5X it is used twice
with two sets of timings, the first with a short trailer space for the
space in the middle, and the second with no leader so that it can
continue the space.

The encoding in RC-5-SZ first inserts a pulse and then simply utilizes
the generic Manchester encoder available in rc-core.
