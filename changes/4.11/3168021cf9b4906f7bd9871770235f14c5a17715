Btrfs: do not create explicit holes when replaying log tree if NO_HOLES enabled

We log holes explicitly by using file extent items, however when replaying
a log tree, if a logged file extent item corresponds to a hole and the
NO_HOLES feature is enabled we do not need to copy the file extent item
into the fs/subvolume tree, as the absence of such file extent items is
the purpose of the NO_HOLES feature. So skip the copying of file extent
items representing holes when the NO_HOLES feature is enabled.
