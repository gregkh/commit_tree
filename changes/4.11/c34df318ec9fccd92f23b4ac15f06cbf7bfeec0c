rtlwifi: Convert COMP_XX entries into a proper debugging mask

The debugging macros contain a parameter COMP_XX that could be used as a
mask; however, the code turns all these various bits on at the same time.
This change implements them as a proper mask, and adds module parameters
to set the mask at load time.

The current name "debug" for the debug level has been changed to
"debug_level" to better differentiate it from "debug_mask".

The debug routines have also been changed to interrogate the structure
that is loaded at entry time. As a result, the structure rtl_debug is no
longer needed, and all references to it are deleted.
