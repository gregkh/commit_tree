EDAC, amd64: Move global code out of instance functions

We have a few functions that register/unregister an ECC error decoding
routine. These functions are called when we init/remove instances.
However, they are global and so don't need to be registered/unregistered
multiple times.

So move them out of the init/remove instance functions and into the
module init/exit routines.
