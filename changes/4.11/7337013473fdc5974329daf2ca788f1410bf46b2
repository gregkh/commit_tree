staging: fsl-mc: dpbp: drop unused APIs

Leave only APIs that will be used in upcomming drivers.
The patch is mostly mechanical, with a couple exceptions:
 - getters/setters were not removed even if only one of
   them is being used
 - versioning API was also left in place
They will be added back on an as-needed basis.
