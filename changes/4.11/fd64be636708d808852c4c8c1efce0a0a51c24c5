drm/i915/gvt: introduced failsafe mode into vgpu

New failsafe mode is introduced, when we detect guest not supporting
GVT-g.
In failsafe mode, we will ignore all the MMIO and cfg space read/write
from guest.

This patch can fix the issue that when guest kernel or graphics driver
version is too low, there will be a lot of kernel traces in host.

V5: rebased onto latest gvt-staging
V4: changed coding style by Zhenyu and Ping's advice
V3: modified coding style and error messages according to Zhenyu's comment
V2: 1) implemented MMIO/GTT/WP pages read/write logic; 2) used a unified
function to enter failsafe mode
