x86/kvm/vmx: Don't fetch the TSS base from the GDT

The current CPU's TSS base is a foregone conclusion, so there's no need
to parse it out of the segment tables.  This should save a couple cycles
(as STR is surely microcoded and poorly optimized) but, more importantly,
it's a cleanup and it means that segment_base() will never be called on
64-bit kernels.
