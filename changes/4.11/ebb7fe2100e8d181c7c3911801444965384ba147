dmaengine: dw: pci: remove LPE Audio DMA ID

LPE Audio driver should take care of DMA IPs by itself. Keeping an ID like this
in dw_dma_pci.c is anyway wrong since that block has two DMA controllers under
one ID (like MFD device).

That's also why I didn't include LPE Audio ID for Intel Merrifield previously.
