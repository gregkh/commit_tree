can: gs_usb: Don't use stack memory for USB transfers

Fixes: 05ca5270005c can: gs_usb: add ethtool set_phys_id callback to locate physical device

The gs_usb driver is performing USB transfers using buffers allocated on
the stack. This causes the driver to not function with vmapped stacks.
Instead, allocate memory for the transfer buffers.
