cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix intel_pstate_verify_policy()

The code added to intel_pstate_verify_policy() by commit 1443ebbacfd7
(cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix sysfs limits enforcement for performance
policy) should use perf_limits instead of limits, because otherwise
setting global limits via sysfs may affect policies inconsistently.

For example, in the sequence of shell commands below, the
scaling_min_freq attribute for policy1 and policy2 should be
affected in the same way, because scaling_governor is set in
the same way for both of them:

 # cat cpufreq/policy1/scaling_governor
 powersave
 # cat cpufreq/policy2/scaling_governor
 powersave
 # echo performance > cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor
 # echo 94 > intel_pstate/min_perf_pct
 # cat cpufreq/policy0/scaling_min_freq
 2914000
 # cat cpufreq/policy1/scaling_min_freq
 2914000
 # cat cpufreq/policy2/scaling_min_freq
 800000

The are affected differently, because intel_pstate_verify_policy()
is invoked with limits set to &performance_limits (left behind by
policy0) for policy1 and with limits set to &powersave_limits (left
behind by policy1) for policy2.  Since perf_limits is set to the
set of limits matching the policy being updated, using it instead
of limits fixes the inconsistency.
