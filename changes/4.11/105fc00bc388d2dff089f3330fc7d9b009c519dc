ARM: dts: STiH410-b2260: Identify the UART RTS line

When hardware flow-control is disabled, manual toggling of the UART's
reset line (RTS) using userland applications (e.g. stty) is not
possible, since the ASC IP does not provide this functionality in the
same was as some other IPs do.  Thus, we have to do this manually.
This patch configures the UART RTS line as a GPIO for manipulation
within the UART driver when HW flow-control is not enabled.
