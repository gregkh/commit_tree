s390: make setup_randomness work

Commit bcfcbb6bae64 ("s390: add system information as device
randomness") intended to add some virtual machine specific information
to the randomness pool.

Unfortunately it uses the page allocator before it is ready to use. In
result the page allocator always returns NULL and the setup_randomness
function never adds anything to the randomness pool.

To fix this use memblock_alloc and memblock_free instead.
