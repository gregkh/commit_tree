KVM: MIPS: Pass type of fault down to kvm_mips_map_page()

kvm_mips_map_page() will need to know whether the fault was due to a
read or a write in order to support dirty page tracking,
KVM_CAP_SYNC_MMU, and read only memory regions, so get that information
passed down to it via new bool write_fault arguments to various
functions.
