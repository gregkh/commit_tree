slab: reorganize memcg_cache_params

We're going to change how memcg caches are iterated.  In preparation,
clean up and reorganize memcg_cache_params.

* The shared ->list is replaced by ->children in root and
  ->children_node in children.

* ->is_root_cache is removed.  Instead ->root_cache is moved out of
  the child union and now used by both root and children.  NULL
  indicates root cache.  Non-NULL a memcg one.

This patch doesn't cause any observable behavior changes.
