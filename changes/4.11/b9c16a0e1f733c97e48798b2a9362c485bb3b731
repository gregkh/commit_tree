locking/mutex: Fix lockdep_assert_held() fail

In commit:

  659cf9f5824a ("locking/ww_mutex: Optimize ww-mutexes by waking at most one waiter for backoff when acquiring the lock")

I replaced a comment with a lockdep_assert_held(). However it turns out
we hide that lock from lockdep for hysterical raisins, which results
in the assertion always firing.

Remove the old debug code as lockdep will easily spot the abuse it was
meant to catch, which will make the lock visible to lockdep and make
the assertion work as intended.
