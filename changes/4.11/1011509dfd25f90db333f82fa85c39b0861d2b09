ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Use set_tdm_slot to set the dma channel

DMA channel(stream tag) used by the HDA link need to programmed in
codec so that codec receives packet from the link associated with the
same channel.

DMA channel is allocated in link BE dai hw_params, the same needs to be
set for the BE codec dai. Instead of using get/set dma_data(), use
dai_ops snd_soc_dai_set_tdm_slot() to set the stream tag.
