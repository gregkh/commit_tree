gpio: mockup: readability tweaks

The following patch tries to improve the readability of the mockup
driver.

The driver is called gpio-mockup, so add the same prefix to all
functions and structures.

Add some newlines and use a temporary pointer in gpio_mockup_add().

Drop the name of the direction enum and rename the enum values to
better reflect their purpose.
