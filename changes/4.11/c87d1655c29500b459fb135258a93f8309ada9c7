zram: remove obsolete sysfs attrs

We had a deprecated_attr_warn() warning for 2 years and now the time has
come and we finally can do the cleanup.

The plan was as follows:

: per-stat sysfs attributes are considered to be deprecated.
: The basic strategy is:
: -- the existing RW nodes will be downgraded to WO nodes (in linux 4.11)
: -- deprecated RO sysfs nodes will eventually be removed (in linux 4.11)
:
: The list of deprecated attributes can be found here:
: Documentation/ABI/obsolete/sysfs-block-zram
:
: Basically, every attribute that has its own read accessible sysfs
: node (e.g. num_reads) *AND* is accessible via one of the stat files
: (zram<id>/stat or zram<id>/io_stat or zram<id>/mm_stat) is considered
: to be deprecated.

The patch also removes `obsolete/sysfs-block-zram', clean ups
`testing/sysfs-block-zram' and tweaks zram.txt files.
