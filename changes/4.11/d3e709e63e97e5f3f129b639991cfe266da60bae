idr: Return the deleted entry from idr_remove

It is a relatively common idiom (8 instances) to first look up an IDR
entry, and then remove it from the tree if it is found, possibly doing
further operations upon the entry afterwards.  If we change idr_remove()
to return the removed object, all of these users can save themselves a
walk of the IDR tree.
