f2fs: fix multiple f2fs_add_link() calls having same name

It turns out a stakable filesystem like sdcardfs in AOSP can trigger multiple
vfs_create() to lower filesystem. In that case, f2fs will add multiple dentries
having same name which breaks filesystem consistency.

Until upper layer fixes, let's work around by f2fs, which shows actually not
much performance regression.
