drm: Convert all helpers to drm_connector_list_iter

Mostly nothing special (except making sure that really all error paths
and friends call iter_put).

v2: Don't forget the raw connector_list walking in
drm_helper_move_panel_connectors_to_head. That one unfortunately can't
be converted to the iterator helpers, but since it's just some list
splicing best to just wrap the entire thing up in one critical
section.

v3: Bail out after iter_put (Harry).
