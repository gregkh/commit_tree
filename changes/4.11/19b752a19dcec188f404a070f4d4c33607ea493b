IB/cma: Allow port reuse for rdma_id

When allocating a port number for binding to a rdma_id, assuming the
allocation is not for a specific port, the rule is to allow only ports
that were not in use before by any other rdma_id.

This condition is too strong to achieve the goal of a unique 5 tuple
rdma_id. Instead, we can compare current rdma_id with other rdma_id for
difference in one of destination port, source address and destination
address to allow port reuse.
