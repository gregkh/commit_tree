ALSA: seq: Fix race during FIFO resize

When a new event is queued while processing to resize the FIFO in
snd_seq_fifo_clear(), it may lead to a use-after-free, as the old pool
that is being queued gets removed.  For avoiding this race, we need to
close the pool to be deleted and sync its usage before actually
deleting it.

The issue was spotted by syzkaller.
