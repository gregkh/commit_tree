batman-adv: Fix double call of dev_queue_xmit

The net_xmit_eval has side effects because it is not making sure that e
isn't evaluated twice.

    #define net_xmit_eval(e)        ((e) == NET_XMIT_CN ? 0 : (e))

The code requested by David Miller [1]

    return net_xmit_eval(dev_queue_xmit(skb));

will get transformed into

    return ((dev_queue_xmit(skb)) == NET_XMIT_CN ? 0 : (dev_queue_xmit(skb)))

dev_queue_xmit will therefore be tried again (with an already consumed skb)
whenever the return code is not NET_XMIT_CN.
