scsi: aacraid: Save adapter fib log before an IOP reset

Currently  the adapter firmware does not save outstanding I/O's log
information  when an IOP reset is triggered. This is problematic when
trying to root cause and debug issues.

Fixed by adding sync command to trigger I/O log file save in the adapter
firmware before issuing an IOP reset.
