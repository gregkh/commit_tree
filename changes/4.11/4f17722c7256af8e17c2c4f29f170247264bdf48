sched/headers: Prepare for new header dependencies before moving code to <linux/sched/loadavg.h>

We are going to split <linux/sched/loadavg.h> out of <linux/sched.h>, which
will have to be picked up from a couple of .c files.

Create a trivial placeholder <linux/sched/topology.h> file that just
maps to <linux/sched.h> to make this patch obviously correct and
bisectable.

Include the new header in the files that are going to need it.
