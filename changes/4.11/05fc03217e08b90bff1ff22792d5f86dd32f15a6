drm/mm: Some doc polish

Added some boilerplate for the structs, documented members where they
are relevant and plenty of markup for hyperlinks all over. And a few
small wording polish.

Note that the intro needs some more love after the DRM_MM_INSERT_*
patch from Chris has landed.

v2: Spelling fixes (Chris).

v3: Use &struct foo instead of &foo structure (Chris).
