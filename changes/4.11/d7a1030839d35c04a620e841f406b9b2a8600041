md: fast clone bio in bio_clone_mddev()

Firstly bio_clone_mddev() is used in raid normal I/O and isn't
in resync I/O path.

Secondly all the direct access to bvec table in raid happens on
resync I/O except for write behind of raid1, in which we still
use bio_clone() for allocating new bvec table.

So this patch replaces bio_clone() with bio_clone_fast()
in bio_clone_mddev().

Also kill bio_clone_mddev() and call bio_clone_fast() directly, as
suggested by Christoph Hellwig.
