staging: lustre: osc: avoid 64 divide in osc_cache_too_much

The use of 64 bit time introduces an expensive 64 bit
division operation. Since the time lapse being calculated
in osc_cache_too_much will never be more than seventy years
we can cast the time lapse to an long and perform a normal
32 bit divison operation instead.
