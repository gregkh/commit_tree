ASoC: Intel: Common: Update dsp register poll implementation

Poll implementation is not quite accurate, especially for smaller
values of timeout or timeout values close to the actual timeout needed

Use jiffies to set the timeout value and time_before() to get the
accurate time. So update the dsp register poll implementation to
provide accurate timeout using jiffies.
