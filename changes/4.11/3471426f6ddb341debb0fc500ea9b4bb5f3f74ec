phy: qcom-ufs: Correct usage of regulator_get()

When regulator_get() tries to resolve a regulator supply but fail to
find a matching property in DeviceTree it returns a dummy regulator, if
a matching supply is specified but unavailable the regulator core will
return an error.

Based on this we should not ignore errors upon failing to acquire the
optional "vddp-ref-clk" supply.
