mlxsw: spectrum: Introduce ACL core with simple TCAM implementation

Add ACL core infrastructure for Spectrum ASIC. This infra provides an
abstraction layer over specific HW implementations. There are two basic
objects used. One is "rule" and the second is "ruleset" which serves as a
container of multiple rules. In general, within one ruleset the rules are
allowed to have multiple priorities and masks. Each ruleset is bound to
either ingress or egress a of port netdevice.

The initial TCAM implementation is very simple and limited. It utilizes
parman lsort manager to take care of TCAM region layout.
