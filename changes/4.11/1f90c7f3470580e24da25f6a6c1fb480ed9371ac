bridge: modify bridge and port to have often accessed fields in one cache line

Move around net_bridge so the vlan fields are in the beginning since
they're checked on every packet even if vlan filtering is disabled.
For the port move flags & vlan group to the beginning, so they're in the
same cache line with the port's state (both flags and state are checked
on each packet).
