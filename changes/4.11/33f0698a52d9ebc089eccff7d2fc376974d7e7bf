regulator: s2mpa01: reduce stack size for probe function

In some rare configurations we can run into rather high kernel stack
consumption:

drivers/regulator/s2mpa01.c:397:1: error: the frame size of 1536 bytes is larger than 1152 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

This is probably harmless since it happens only in the probe function,
but there is also a relatively simple workaround, moving the regulator
match data into the device specific structure.

As a small downside, we waste a little memory at runtime. An alternative
approach would free the array at the end of the probe function, which in
turn is a little more complicated.
