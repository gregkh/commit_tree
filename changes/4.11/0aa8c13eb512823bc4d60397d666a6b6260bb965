ipv6: drop non loopback packets claiming to originate from ::1

We lack a saddr check for ::1. This causes security issues e.g. with acls
permitting connections from ::1 because of assumption that these originate
from local machine.

Assuming a source address of ::1 is local seems reasonable.
RFC4291 doesn't allow such a source address either, so drop such packets.
