MIPS: BMIPS: Migrate interrupts during bmips_cpu_disable

While we properly disabled the per-CPU timer interrupt, we also need to
make sure that all interrupts that can possibly have this CPU in their
smp_affinity mask also have a chance to see this interrupt migrated to a
CPU not being taken offline.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Fix merge conflict.]
