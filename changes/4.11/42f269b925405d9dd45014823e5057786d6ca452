ovl: rearrange code in ovl_copy_up_locked()

As preparation to implementing copy up with O_TMPFILE,
name the variable for dentry before final rename 'temp' and
assign it to 'newdentry' only after rename.

Also lookup upper dentry before looking up temp dentry and
move ovl_set_timestamps() into ovl_copy_up_locked(), because
that is going to be more convenient for upcoming change.
