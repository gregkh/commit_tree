pNFS: return status from nfs4_pnfs_ds_connect

The nfs4_pnfs_ds_connect path can call rpc_create which can fail or it
can wait on another context to reach the same failure.

This checks that the rpc_create succeeded and returns the error to the
caller.

When an error is returned, both the files and flexfiles layouts will return
NULL from _prepare_ds(). The flexfiles layout will also return the layout
with the error NFS4ERR_NXIO.
