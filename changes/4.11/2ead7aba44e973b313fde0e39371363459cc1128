openrisc: entry: Whitespace and comment cleanups

Cleanups to whitespace and add some comments. Reading through the delay
slot logic I noticed some things:
 - Delay slot instructions were not indented
 - Some comments are not lined up
 - Use tabs and spaces consistent with other code

No functional change
