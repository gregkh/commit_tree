MIPS: traps: Ensure L1 & L2 ECC checking match for CM3 systems

On systems with CM3, we must ensure that the L1 & L2 ECC enables are set
to the same value. This is presumed by the hardware & cache corruption
can occur when it is not the case. Support enabling & disabling the L2
ECC checking on CM3 systems where this is controlled via a GCR, and
ensure that it matches the state of L1 ECC checking. Remove I6400 from
the switch statement it will no longer hit, and which was incorrect
since the L2 ECC enable bit isn't in the CP0 ErrCtl register.
