overlayfs: remove now unnecessary header file include

This removes the extra include header file that was added in commit
e58bc927835a "Pull overlayfs updates from Miklos Szeredi" now that it
is no longer needed.

There are probably other such includes that got added during the
scheduler header splitup series, but this is the one that annoyed me
personally and I know about.
