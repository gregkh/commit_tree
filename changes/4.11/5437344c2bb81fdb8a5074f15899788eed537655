sparc: migrate exception table users onto extable.h

This file was using module.h for search_exception_table.  We've
now separated that content out into its own file "extable.h" so
now move over to that.  Unlike most other instances, we can't
delete the module.h include here since the file needs that for
the within_module_init definition.
