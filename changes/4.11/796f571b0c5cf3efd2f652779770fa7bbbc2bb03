procfs: use an enum for possible hidepid values

Previously, the hidepid parameter was checked by comparing literal
integers 0, 1, 2.  Let's add a proper enum for this, to make the
checking more expressive:

        0 → HIDEPID_OFF
        1 → HIDEPID_NO_ACCESS
        2 → HIDEPID_INVISIBLE

This changes the internal labelling only, the userspace-facing interface
remains unmodified, and still works with literal integers 0, 1, 2.

No functional changes.
