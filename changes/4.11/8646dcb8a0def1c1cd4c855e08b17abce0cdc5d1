drm/exynos: fix a timeout loop

We were trying to print an error message if we timed out here, but the
loop actually ends with "tries" set to UINT_MAX and not zero.  Fix this
by changing from tries-- to --tries.

A for loop would actually be the most natural way to do this.  My fix
means we only loop 99 times instead of 100 but that's probably ok.
