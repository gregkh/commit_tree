serial: 8250_omap: Fix probe and remove for PM runtime

Otherwise the interconnect related code implementing PM runtime will
produce these errors on a failed probe:

omap_uart 48066000.serial: omap_device: omap_device_enable() called from invalid state 1
omap_uart 48066000.serial: use pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() in driver?

Note that we now also need to check for priv in omap8250_runtime_suspend()
as it has not yet been registered if probe fails. And we need to use
pm_runtime_put_sync() to properly idle the device like we already do
in omap8250_remove().
