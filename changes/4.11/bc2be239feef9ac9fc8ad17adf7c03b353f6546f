serial: imx: Fix the CTS_B polarity in RS485 mode

When userspace passes the SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND flag it means that the
CTS_B pin should go to logic level high before the transmission begins.

CTS_B goes to logic level high when both CTSC and CTS bits are cleared.

When userspace passes the SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND flag it means that the
CTS_B pin should go to logic level low after the transmission finishes.

CTS_B goes to logic level low when CTSC bit is cleared and CTS bit is set.

So fix the CTS_B polarity logic.
