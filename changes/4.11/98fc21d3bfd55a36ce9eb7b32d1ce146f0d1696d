svcrdma: Clean up RPC-over-RDMA Reply header encoder

Replace C structure-based XDR decoding with pointer arithmetic.
Pointer arithmetic is considered more portable, and is used
throughout the kernel's existing XDR encoders. The gcc optimizer
generates similar assembler code either way.

Byte-swapping before a memory store on x86 typically results in an
instruction pipeline stall. Avoid byte-swapping when encoding a new
header.

svcrdma currently doesn't alter a connection's credit grant value
after the connection has been accepted, so it is effectively a
constant. Cache the byte-swapped value in a separate field.

Christoph suggested pulling the header encoding logic into the only
function that uses it.
