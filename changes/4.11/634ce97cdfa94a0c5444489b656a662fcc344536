selftests: Fix the .S and .S -> .o rules

Both these rules incorrectly use $< (first prerequisite) rather than
$^ (all prerequisites), meaning they don't work if we're using more than
one .S file as input. Switch them to using $^.

They also don't include $(CPPFLAGS) and other variables used in the
default rules, which breaks targets that require those. Fix that by
using the builtin $(COMPILE.S) and $(LINK.S) rules.
