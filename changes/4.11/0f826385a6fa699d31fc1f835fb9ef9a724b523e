net: marvell: skge: use new api ethtool_{get|set}_link_ksettings

The ethtool api {get|set}_settings is deprecated.
We move this driver to new api {get|set}_link_ksettings.

The callback set_link_ksettings no longer update the value
of advertising, as the struct ethtool_link_ksettings is
defined as const.

As I don't have the hardware, I'd be very pleased if
someone may test this patch.
