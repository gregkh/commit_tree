KVM: MIPS/T&E: Expose CP0_EntryLo0/1 registers

Expose the CP0_EntryLo0 and CP0_EntryLo1 registers through the KVM
register access API. This is fairly straightforward for trap & emulate
since we don't support the RI and XI bits. For the sake of future
proofing (particularly for VZ) it is explicitly specified that the API
always exposes the 64-bit version of these registers (i.e. with the RI
and XI bits in bit positions 63 and 62 respectively), and they are
implemented in trap_emul.c rather than mips.c to allow them to be
implemented differently for VZ.
