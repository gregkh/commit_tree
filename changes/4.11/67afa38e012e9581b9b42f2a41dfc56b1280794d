mm/swap: add cache for swap slots allocation

We add per cpu caches for swap slots that can be allocated and freed
quickly without the need to touch the swap info lock.

Two separate caches are maintained for swap slots allocated and swap
slots returned.  This is to allow the swap slots to be returned to the
global pool in a batch so they will have a chance to be coaelesced with
other slots in a cluster.  We do not reuse the slots that are returned
right away, as it may increase fragmentation of the slots.

The swap allocation cache is protected by a mutex as we may sleep when
searching for empty slots in cache.  The swap free cache is protected by
a spin lock as we cannot sleep in the free path.

We refill the swap slots cache when we run out of slots, and we disable
the swap slots cache and drain the slots if the global number of slots
fall below a low watermark threshold.  We re-enable the cache agian when
the slots available are above a high watermark.
