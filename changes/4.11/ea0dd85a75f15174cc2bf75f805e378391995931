drm/doc: use preferred struct reference in kernel-doc

sed -e 's/\( \* .*\)struct &\([_a-z]*\)/\1\&struct \2/' -i

Originally I wasnt a friend of this style because I thought a
line-break between the "&struct" and "foo" part would break it. But a
quick test shows that " * &struct \n * foo\n" works pefectly well with
current kernel-doc. So time to mass-apply these changes!
