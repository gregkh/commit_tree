console: Add callback to flush scrollback buffer to consw struct

This new callback is in preparation for persistent scrollback buffer
support for VGA consoles.
With a single scrollback buffer for all consoles, we could flush the
buffer just by invocating consw->con_switch(). But when each VGA console
has its own scrollback buffer, we need a new callback to tell the
video console driver which buffer to flush.
