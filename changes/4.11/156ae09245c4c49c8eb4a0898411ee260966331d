dmaengine: zx: fix residue calculation

The dma residue is defined as the free space to end of transfer buffer,
which could be multiple segments chained together.  So the residue
calculation in zx_dma_tx_status() works for both slave_sg and cyclic
case.  But unfortunately, the 'index' is wrong.  It should plus one,
because the current segment is already occupied and shouldn't be counted
into free space.

This fixes the HDMI audio noise issue we see on ZX296718 with SPDIF
interface.
