net/ena: refactor ena_get_stats64 to be atomic context safe

ndo_get_stat64() can be called from atomic context, but the current
implementation sends an admin command to retrieve the statistics from
the device. This admin command can sleep.

This patch re-factors the implementation of ena_get_stats64() to use
the {rx,tx}bytes/count from the driver's inner counters, and to obtain
the rx drop counter from the asynchronous keep alive (heart bit)
event.
