can: dev: can_changelink: allow to set bitrate on devices not providing {data_,}bittiming_const

Until commit

    08da7da41ea4 can: provide a separate bittiming_const parameter to
                 bittiming functions

it was possible to have devices not providing bittiming_const. This can
be used for hardware that only support pre-defined fixed bitrates.
Although no mainline driver is using this feature so far.

This patch re-introduces this feature for the bitrate and the data
bitrate (of CANFD controllers). The driver can specify the
{data_,}bittiming_const (if the bittiming parameters should be
calculated from the bittiming_const) as before or no
{data_,}bittiming_const but implement the do_set_{data,}bittiming
callback.
