x86/boot: Include missing header file

Sparse complains about missing forward declarations:

arch/x86/boot/compressed/error.c:8:6:
	warning: symbol 'warn' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/x86/boot/compressed/error.c:15:6:
	warning: symbol 'error' was not declared. Should it be static?

Include the missing header file.
