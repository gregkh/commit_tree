clk: sunxi-ng: Implement global pre-divider

Some clocks have a global pre-divider that applies to all their parents.

Since it might also apply to clocks that have a single parent, this is
merged in the ccu_common structure, unlike the other pre-divider settings
that are tied to a specific index, and thus a specific parent.
