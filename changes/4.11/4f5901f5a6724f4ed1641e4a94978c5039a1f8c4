linux/kernel.h: fix DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST to support negative divisors

While working on a thermal driver I encounter a scenario where the
divisor could be negative, instead of adding local code to handle this I
though I first try to add support for this in DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST.

Add support to DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST for negative divisors if both dividend
and divisor variable types are signed.  This should not alter current
behavior for users of the macro as previously negative divisors where
not supported.

Before:

DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(  59,  4) =  15
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(  59, -4) = -14
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST( -59,  4) = -15
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST( -59, -4) =  14

After:

DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(  59,  4) =  15
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(  59, -4) = -15
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST( -59,  4) = -15
DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST( -59, -4) =  15
