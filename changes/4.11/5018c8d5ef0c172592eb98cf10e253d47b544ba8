iommu/arm-smmu: Do not advertise IOMMU_CAP_INTR_REMAP anymore

IOMMU_CAP_INTR_REMAP has been advertised in arm-smmu(-v3) although
on ARM this property is not attached to the IOMMU but rather is
implemented in the MSI controller (GICv3 ITS).

Now vfio_iommu_type1 checks MSI remapping capability at MSI controller
level, let's correct this.
