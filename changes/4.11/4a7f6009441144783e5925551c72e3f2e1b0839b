tcp: remove thin_dupack feature

Thin stream DUPACK is to start fast recovery on only one DUPACK
provided the connection is a thin stream (i.e., low inflight).  But
this older feature is now subsumed with RACK. If a connection
receives only a single DUPACK, RACK would arm a reordering timer
and soon starts fast recovery instead of timeout if no further
ACKs are received.

The socket option (THIN_DUPACK) is kept as a nop for compatibility.
Note that this patch does not change another thin-stream feature
which enables linear RTO. Although it might be good to generalize
that in the future (i.e., linear RTO for the first say 3 retries).
