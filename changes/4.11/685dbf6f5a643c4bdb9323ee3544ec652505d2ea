mm, page_alloc: warn_alloc nodemask is NULL when cpusets are disabled

The patch "mm, page_alloc: warn_alloc print nodemask" implicitly sets
the allocation nodemask to cpuset_current_mems_allowed when there is no
effective mempolicy.  cpuset_current_mems_allowed is only effective when
cpusets are enabled, which is also printed by warn_alloc(), so setting
the nodemask to cpuset_current_mems_allowed is redundant and prevents
debugging issues where ac->nodemask is not set properly in the page
allocator.

This provides better debugging output since
cpuset_print_current_mems_allowed() is already provided.
