Input: cyapa - use time based retry loop

Using counter based retry loops for peripherals results in the delay
being significantly overrun during high-load situations where delay
functions tend to be vary imprecise and overrun there timeouts. So
condition the termination on the actual condition of 2s for the
re-calibration to have been successful.

As this is a very long delay there is no advantage in using
high-resolution timers thus switching this to msleep().
