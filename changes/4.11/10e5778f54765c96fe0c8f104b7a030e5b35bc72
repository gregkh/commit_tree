ARM: OMAP2+: Fix device node reference counts

After commit 0549bde0fcb1 ("of: fix of_node leak caused in
of_find_node_opts_by_path"), the following error may be
reported when running omap images.

of_find_node_by_name() drops the reference to the passed device node.
The commit referenced above exposes this problem.

To fix the problem, use of_get_child_by_name() instead of
of_find_node_by_name(); of_get_child_by_name() does not drop
the reference count of passed device nodes. While semantically
different, we only look for immediate children of the passed
device node, so of_get_child_by_name() is a more appropriate
function to use anyway.

Release the reference to the device node obtained with
of_get_child_by_name() after it is no longer needed to avoid
another device node leak.

While at it, clean up the code and change the return type of
omap3xxx_hwmod_is_hs_ip_block_usable() to bool to match its use
and the return type of of_device_is_available().
