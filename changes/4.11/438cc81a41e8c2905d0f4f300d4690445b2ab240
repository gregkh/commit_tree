powerpc/pseries: Automatically resize HPT for memory hot add/remove

We've now implemented code in the pseries platform to use the new PAPR
interface to allow resizing the hash page table (HPT) at runtime.

This patch uses that interface to automatically attempt to resize the HPT
when memory is hot added or removed.  This tries to always keep the HPT at
a reasonable size for our current memory size.
