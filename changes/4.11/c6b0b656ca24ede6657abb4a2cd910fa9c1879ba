ceph: clean up unsafe d_parent accesses in build_dentry_path

While we hold a reference to the dentry when build_dentry_path is
called, we could end up racing with a rename that changes d_parent.
Handle that situation correctly, by using the rcu_read_lock to
ensure that the parent dentry and inode stick around long enough
to safely check ceph_snap and ceph_ino.
