net: mpls: Fix nexthop alive tracking on down events

Alive tracking of nexthops can account for a link twice if the carrier
goes down followed by an admin down of the same link rendering multipath
routes useless. This is similar to 79099aab38c8 for UNREGISTER events and
DOWN events.

Fix by tracking number of alive nexthops in mpls_ifdown similar to the
logic in mpls_ifup. Checking the flags per nexthop once after all events
have been processed is simpler than trying to maintian a running count
through all event combinations.

Also, WRITE_ONCE is used instead of ACCESS_ONCE to set rt_nhn_alive
per a comment from checkpatch:
    WARNING: Prefer WRITE_ONCE(<FOO>, <BAR>) over ACCESS_ONCE(<FOO>) = <BAR>
