powerpc/64: Make type of partition table flush depend on partition type

When changing a partition table entry on POWER9, we do a particular
form of the tlbie instruction which flushes all TLBs and caches of
the partition table for a given logical partition ID (LPID).
This instruction has a field in the instruction word, labelled R
(radix), which should be 1 if the partition was previously a radix
partition and 0 if it was a HPT partition.  This implements that
logic.
