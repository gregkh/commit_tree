bug: switch data corruption check to __must_check

The CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() macro was designed to have callers do
something meaningful/protective on failure.  However, using "return
false" in the macro too strictly limits the design patterns of callers.
Instead, let callers handle the logic test directly, but make sure that
the result IS checked by forcing __must_check (which appears to not be
able to be used directly on macro expressions).
