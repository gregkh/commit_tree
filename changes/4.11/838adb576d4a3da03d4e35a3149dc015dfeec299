drivers: pinctrl: add driver for Allwinner H5 SoC

Based on the Allwinner H5 datasheet and the pinctrl driver of the
backward-compatible H3 this introduces the pin multiplex assignments for
the H5 SoC.

H5 introduced some more pin functions (e.g. three more groups of TS
pins, and one more groups of SIM pins) than H3.
