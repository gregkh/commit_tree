cpufreq: Add the "cpufreq.off=1" cmdline option

Add the "cpufreq.off=1" cmdline option.

At boot-time, this allows a user to request CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=n
behavior from a kernel built with CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=y.

This is analogous to the existing "cpuidle.off=1" option
and CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y

This capability is valuable when we need to debug end-user
issues in the BIOS or in Linux.  It is also convenient
for enabling comparisons, which may otherwise require a new kernel,
or help from BIOS SETUP, which may be buggy or unavailable.
