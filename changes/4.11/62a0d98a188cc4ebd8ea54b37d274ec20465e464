drm: allow to use mmuless SoC

Some SoC without MMU have display driver where a drm/kms driver
could be implemented.

Before doing such kind of thing drm/kms must allow to use mmuless devices.
This patch propose to remove MMU configuration flag and add a cma helper
function to help implementing mmuless display driver

version 4:
- add documentation about drm_gem_cma_get_unmapped_area()
- stub it MMU case
