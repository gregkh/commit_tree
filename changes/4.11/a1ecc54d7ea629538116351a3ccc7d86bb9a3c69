KVM: MIPS/T&E: Don't treat code fetch faults as MMIO

In order to make use of the CP0_BadInstr & CP0_BadInstrP registers we
need to be a bit more careful not to treat code fetch faults as MMIO,
lest we hit an UNPREDICTABLE register value when we try to emulate the
MMIO load instruction but there was no valid instruction word available
to the hardware.

Add a kvm_is_ifetch_fault() helper to try to figure out whether a load
fault was due to a code fetch, and prevent MMIO instruction emulation in
that case.
