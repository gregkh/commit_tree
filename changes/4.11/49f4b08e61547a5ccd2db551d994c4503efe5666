pci/hotplug/pnv-php: Disable MSI and PCI device properly

pnv_php_disable_irq() can be called in two paths: Bailing path in
pnv_php_enable_irq() or releasing slot. The MSI (or MSIx) interrupts
is disabled unconditionally in pnv_php_disable_irq(). It's wrong
because that might be enabled by drivers other than pnv-php.

This disables MSI (or MSIx) interrupts and the PCI device only if
it was enabled by pnv-php. In the error path of pnv_php_enable_irq(),
we rely on the newly added parameter @disable_device. In the path
of releasing slot, @pnv_php->irq is checked.
