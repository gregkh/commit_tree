ARM: dts: sun8i: parrot: use AXP223 DTSI

Previously, the Allwinner Parrot R16 used everything declared in AXP221
DTSI while it has an AXP223 PMIC.

This corrects that so the Allwinner Parrot R16 can get some features the
AXP223 has (at the moment, ability to have 100mA as maximal current on
VBUS power supply).
