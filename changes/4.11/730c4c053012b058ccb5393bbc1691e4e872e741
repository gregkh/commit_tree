PM / sleep / docs: Convert PM notifiers document to reST

Move the document describing PM notifiers (used during system sleep
state transitions) to Documentation/driver-api/pm/, convert it to reST
and update it to use current terminology.  Also replace the remaining
references to the old version of it in .txt documents with references
to the new one.
