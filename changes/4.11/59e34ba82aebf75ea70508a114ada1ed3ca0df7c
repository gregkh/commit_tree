[media] tc358743: Do not read number of CSI lanes in use from chip

The number of CSI lanes that should be used is set to the CSI_CONTROL
register by indirectly writing to the CSI_CONFW register. When the
number of lanes is read back from the CSI_CONTROL register the value
is usually correct, but we have seen that it suddenly is 1 for a short
moment before the correct value is restored again.

Toshiba have not figured out why that happen, but we have found it
safer to store the value in the driver.
