pinctrl: samsung: Add missing part for PINCFG_TYPE_DRV of Exynos5433

The commit 1259feddd0f8("pinctrl: samsung: Fix the width of
PINCFG_TYPE_DRV bitfields for Exynos5433") already fixed
the different width of PINCFG_TYPE_DRV from previous Exynos SoC.

However wrong merge conflict resolution was chosen in commit
7f36f5d11cda ("Merge tag 'v4.10-rc6' into devel") effectively dropping
the changes for PINCFG_TYPE_DRV.  Re-do them here.

The macro EXYNOS_PIN_BANK_EINTW is no longer used so remove it.

Fixes: 7f36f5d11cda ("Merge tag 'v4.10-rc6' into devel")
