pwm: constify pwm_ops structures

Declare pwm_ops structures as const as they are only stored in the ops
field of a pwm_chip structure. This field is of type const struct pwm_ops
*, so pwm_ops structures having this property can be declared as const.
Done using Coccinelle:

static struct pwm_ops i@p={...};

@ok1@
