arm64: cpufeature: remove explicit RAZ fields

We currently have some RAZ fields described explicitly in our
arm64_ftr_bits arrays. These are inconsistently commented, grouped,
and/or applied, and maintaining these is error-prone.

Luckily, we don't need these at all. We'll never need to inspect RAZ
fields to determine feature support, and init_cpu_ftr_reg() will ensure
that any bits without a corresponding arm64_ftr_bits entry are treated
as RES0 with strict matching requirements. In check_update_ftr_reg()
we'll then compare these bits from the relevant cpuinfo_arm64
structures, and need not store them in a arm64_ftr_reg.

This patch removes the unnecessary arm64_ftr_bits entries for RES0 bits.
