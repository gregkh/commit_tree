block: Move bdi_unregister() to del_gendisk()

Commit 6cd18e711dd8 "block: destroy bdi before blockdev is
unregistered." moved bdi unregistration (at that time through
bdi_destroy()) from blk_release_queue() to blk_cleanup_queue() because
it needs to happen before blk_unregister_region() call in del_gendisk()
for MD. SCSI though will free up the device number from sd_remove()
called through a maze of callbacks from device_del() in
__scsi_remove_device() before blk_cleanup_queue() and thus similar races
as described in 6cd18e711dd8 can happen for SCSI as well as reported by
Omar [1].

Moving bdi_unregister() to del_gendisk() works for MD and fixes the
problem for SCSI since del_gendisk() gets called from sd_remove() before
freeing the device number.

This also makes device_add_disk() (calling bdi_register_owner()) more
symmetric with del_gendisk().
