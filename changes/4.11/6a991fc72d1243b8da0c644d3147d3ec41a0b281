mm/swap: fix kernel message in swap_info_get()

Patch series "mm/swap: Regular page swap optimizations", v5.

Times have changed.  Coming generation of Solid state Block device
latencies are getting down to sub 100 usec, which is within an order of
magnitude of DRAM, and their performance is orders of magnitude higher
than the single- spindle rotational media we've swapped to historically.

This could benefit many usage scenearios.  For example cloud providers
who overcommit their memory (as VM don't use all the memory
provisioned).  Having a fast swap will allow them to be more aggressive
in memory overcommit and fit more VMs to a platform.

In our testing [see footnote], the median latency that the kernel adds
to a page fault is 15 usec, which comes quite close to the amount that
will be contributed by the underlying I/O devices.

The software latency comes mostly from contentions on the locks
protecting the radix tree of the swap cache and also the locks
protecting the individual swap devices.  The lock contentions already
consumed 35% of cpu cycles in our test.  In the very near future,
software latency will become the bottleneck to swap performnace as block
device I/O latency gets within the shouting distance of DRAM speed.

This patch set, reduced the median page fault latency from 15 usec to 4
usec (375% reduction) for DRAM based pmem block device.

This patch (of 9):

swap_info_get() is used not only in swap free code path but also in
page_swapcount(), etc.  So the original kernel message in swap_info_get()
is not correct now.  Fix it via replacing "swap_free" to "swap_info_get"
in the message.
