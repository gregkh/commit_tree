orangefs: fix buffer size mis-match between kernel space and user space.

The deamon through which the kernel module communicates with the userspace
part of Orangefs, the "client-core", sends initialization data to the
kernel module with ioctl. The initialization data was built by the
client-core in a 2k buffer and copy_from_user'd into a 1k buffer
in the kernel module. When more than 1k of initialization data needed
to be sent, some was lost, reducing the usability of the control by which
debug levels are set. This patch sets the kernel side buffer to 2K to
match the userspace side...
