usb: chipidea: msm: Restore wrapper settings after reset

When the RESET bit is set in the USBCMD register it resets quite
a few of the wrapper's registers to their reset state. This
includes the GENCONFIG and GENCONFIG2 registers. Currently this
is done by the usb phy and ehci-msm drivers writing into the
controller wrapper's MMIO address space. Let's consolidate the
register writes into the wrapper driver instead so that we
clearly split the wrapper from the phys.
