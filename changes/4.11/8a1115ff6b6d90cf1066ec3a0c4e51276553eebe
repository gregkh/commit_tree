scripts/spelling.txt: add "disble(d)" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  disble||disable
  disbled||disabled

I kept the TSL2563_INT_DISBLED in /drivers/iio/light/tsl2563.c
untouched.  The macro is not referenced at all, but this commit is
touching only comment blocks just in case.
