ASoc: hdac_hdmi: Configure pin verbs for MST

To enable stream on a specific port of a MST capable pin, the port
needs to be selected before we configure the pin widget verb.

When port is selected, all the pin widget verb controlling the sink
device operation will be directed to selected port. So add port
selection before configuring the pin widget verb.
