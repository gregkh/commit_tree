xfs: fix and streamline error handling in xfs_end_io

There are two different cases of buffered I/O errors:

 - first we can have an already shutdown fs.  In that case we should skip
   any on-disk operations and just clean up the appen transaction if
   present and destroy the ioend
 - a real I/O error.  In that case we should cleanup any lingering COW
   blocks.  This gets skipped in the current code and is fixed by this
   patch.
