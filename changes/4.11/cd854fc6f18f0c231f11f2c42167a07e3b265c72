MIPS: uprobes: Remove __weak attribute from arch_uprobe_copy_ixol.

Arch-specific implementation of arch_uprobe_copy_ixol is expected to
override the weak implementation in generic code.
As currently both implementations are marked as weak, it is up to the
linker to chose one. Remove the __weak attribute from MIPS code to make
sure the correct version is used.
