powerpc/pseries: Make the acquire/release of the drc for memory a seperate step

When adding and removing LMBs we should make the acquire/release of
the DRC a separate step to allow for a few improvements. First
this will ensure that LMBs removed during a remove by count operation
are all available if a error occurs and we need to add them back. By
first removeing all the LMBs from the kernel before releasing their
DRCs the LMBs are available to add back should an error occur.

Also, this will allow for faster re-add operations of memory for
PRRN event handling since we can skip the unneeded step of having
to release the DRC and the acquire it back.
