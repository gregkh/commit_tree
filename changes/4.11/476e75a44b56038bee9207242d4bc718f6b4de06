parisc: Avoid stalled CPU warnings after system shutdown

Commit 73580dac7618 ("parisc: Fix system shutdown halt") introduced an endless
loop for systems which don't provide a software power off function.  But the
soft lockup detector will detect this and report stalled CPUs after some time.
Avoid those unwanted warnings by disabling the soft lockup detector.
