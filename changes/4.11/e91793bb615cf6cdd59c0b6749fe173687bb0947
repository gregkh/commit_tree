l2tp: purge socket queues in the .destruct() callback

The Rx path may grab the socket right before pppol2tp_release(), but
nothing guarantees that it will enqueue packets before
skb_queue_purge(). Therefore, the socket can be destroyed without its
queues fully purged.

Fix this by purging queues in pppol2tp_session_destruct() where we're
guaranteed nothing is still referencing the socket.
