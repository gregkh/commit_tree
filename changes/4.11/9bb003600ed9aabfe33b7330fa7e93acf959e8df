arm64: head.S: avoid open-coded adr_l

Some places in the kernel open-code sequences using ADRP for a symbol
another instruction using a :lo12: relocation for that same symbol.
These sequences are easy to get wrong, and more painful to read than is
necessary. For these reasons, it is preferable to use the
{adr,ldr,str}_l macros for these cases.

This patch makes use of adr_l these in head.S, removing an open-coded
sequence using adrp.
