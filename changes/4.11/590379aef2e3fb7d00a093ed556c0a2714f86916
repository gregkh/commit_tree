drm/i915: make context status notifier head be per engine

GVTg has introduced the context status notifier to schedule the GVTg
workload. At that time, the notifier is bound to GVTg context only,
so GVTg is not aware of host workloads.

Now we are going to improve GVTg's guest workload scheduler policy,
and add Guc emulation support for new Gen graphics. Both these two
features require acknowledgment for all contexts running on hardware.
(But will not alter host workload.) So here try to make some change.

The change is simple:
  1. Move the context status notifier head from i915_gem_context to
     intel_engine_cs. Which means there is a notifier head per engine
     instead of per context. Execlist driver still call notifier for
     each context sched-in/out events of current engine.
  2. At GVTg side, it binds a notifier_block for each physical engine
     at GVTg initialization period. Then GVTg can hear all context
     status events.

In this patch, GVTg do nothing for host context event, but later
will add a function there. But in any case, the notifier callback is
a noop if this is no active vGPU.

Since intel_gvt_init() is called at early initialization stage and
require the status notifier head has been initiated, I initiate it in
intel_engine_setup().

v2: remove a redundant newline. (chris)
