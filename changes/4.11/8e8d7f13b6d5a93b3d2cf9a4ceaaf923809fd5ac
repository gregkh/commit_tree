afs: Add some tracepoints

Add three tracepoints to the AFS filesystem:

 (1) The afs_recv_data tracepoint logs data segments that are extracted
     from the data received from the peer through afs_extract_data().

 (2) The afs_notify_call tracepoint logs notification from AF_RXRPC of data
     coming in to an asynchronous call.

 (3) The afs_cb_call tracepoint logs incoming calls that have had their
     operation ID extracted and mapped into a supported cache manager
     service call.

To make (3) work, the name strings in the afs_call_type struct objects have
to be annotated with __tracepoint_string.  This is done with the CM_NAME()
macro.

Further, the AFS call state enum needs a name so that it can be used to
declare parameter types.
