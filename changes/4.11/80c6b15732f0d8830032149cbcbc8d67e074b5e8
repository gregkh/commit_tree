blk-mq-sched: (un)register elevator when (un)registering queue

I noticed that when booting with a default blk-mq I/O scheduler, the
/sys/block/*/queue/iosched directory was missing. However, switching
after boot did create the directory. This is because we skip the initial
elevator register/unregister when we don't have a ->request_fn(), but we
should still do it for the ->mq_ops case.
