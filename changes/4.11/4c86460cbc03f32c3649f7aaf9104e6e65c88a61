KVM: MIPS/MMU: Convert commpage fault handling to page tables

Now that we have GVA page tables and an optimised TLB refill handler in
place, convert the handling of commpage faults from the guest kernel to
fill the GVA page table and invalidate the TLB entry, rather than
filling the wired TLB entry directly.

For simplicity we no longer use a wired entry for the commpage (refill
should be much cheaper with the fast-path handler anyway). Since we
don't need to manipulate the TLB directly any longer, move the function
from tlb.c to mmu.c. This puts it closer to the similar functions
handling KSeg0 and TLB mapped page faults from the guest.
