KVM: s390: Fix guest migration for huge guests resulting in panic

While we can technically not run huge page guests right now, we can
setup a guest with huge pages. Trying to migrate it will trigger a
VM_BUG_ON and, if the kernel is not configured to panic on a BUG, it
will happily try to work on non-existing page table entries.

With this patch, we always return "dirty" if we encounter a large page
when migrating. This at least fixes the immediate problem until we
have proper handling for both kind of pages.

Fixes: 15f36eb ("KVM: s390: Add proper dirty bitmap support to S390 kvm.")
