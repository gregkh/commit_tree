x86/kvm/vmx: Get rid of segment_base() on 64-bit kernels

It was a bit buggy (it didn't list all segment types that needed
64-bit fixups), but the bug was irrelevant because it wasn't called
in any interesting context on 64-bit kernels and was only used for
data segents on 32-bit kernels.

To avoid confusion, make it explicitly 32-bit only.
