parisc: Optimize flush_kernel_vmap_range and invalidate_kernel_vmap_range

The previously submitted patch did not resolve the random segmentation
faults observed on the phantom buildd system.  There are still
unresolved problems with the Debian 4.8 and 4.9 kernels on C8000.

The attached patch removes the flush of the offset map pages and does a
whole data cache flush for large ranges.  No other arch flushes the
offset map in these routines as far as I can tell.

I have not observed any random segmentation faults on rp3440 in two
weeks of testing with 4.10.0 and 4.10.1.
