scsi: aacraid: Reload offlined drives after controller reset

During the IOP reset stress testing, it was found that the drives can be
marked offline when the adapter controller crashes and IO's are running
in parallel. When the controller  does come back from the reset, the drive
that is marked offline is not exposed.

Fixed by removing and adding drives that are marked offline. In addition
invoke a scsi host bus rescan to capture any additional configuration
changes.
