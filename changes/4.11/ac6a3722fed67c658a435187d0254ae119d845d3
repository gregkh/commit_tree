flow dissector: correct size of storage for ARP

The last argument to __skb_header_pointer() should be a buffer large
enough to store struct arphdr. This can be a pointer to a struct arphdr
structure. The code was previously using a pointer to a pointer to
struct arphdr.

By my counting the storage available both before and after is 8 bytes on
x86_64.
