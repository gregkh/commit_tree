zram: set physical queue limits to avoid array out of bounds accesses

zram can handle at most SECTORS_PER_PAGE sectors in a bio's bvec. When using
the NVMe over Fabrics loopback target which potentially sends a huge bulk of
pages attached to the bio's bvec this results in a kernel panic because of
array out of bounds accesses in zram_decompress_page().
