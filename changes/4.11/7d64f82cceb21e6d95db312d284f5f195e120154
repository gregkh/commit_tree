ACPI / APEI: Add missing synchronize_rcu() on NOTIFY_SCI removal

When removing a GHES device notified by SCI, list_del_rcu() is used,
ghes_remove() should call synchronize_rcu() before it goes on to call
kfree(ghes), otherwise concurrent RCU readers may still hold this list
entry after it has been freed.
