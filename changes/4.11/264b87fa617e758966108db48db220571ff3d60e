fq_codel: Avoid regenerating skb flow hash unless necessary

The fq_codel qdisc currently always regenerates the skb flow hash.
This wastes some cycles and prevents flow seperation in cases where
the traffic has been encrypted and can no longer be understood by the
flow dissector.

Change it to use the prexisting flow hash if one exists, and only
regenerate if necessary.
