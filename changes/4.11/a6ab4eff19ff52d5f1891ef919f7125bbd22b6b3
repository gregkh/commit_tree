scripts/spelling.txt: add "applys" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  applys||applies

The "applyes" in drivers/video/fbdev/aty/radeon_monitor.c is a different
pattern but it was fixed in this commit.  The "This functions" in the
same line was fixed as well.
