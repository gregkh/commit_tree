net/mlx5e: Avoid wrong identification of rules on deletion

When deleting offloaded TC flows, we must correctly identify E-switch
rules. The current check could get us wrong w.r.t to rules set on the
PF. Since it's possible to set NIC rules on the PF, switch to SRIOV
offloads mode and then attempt to delete a NIC rule.

To solve that, we add a flags field to offloaded rules, set it on
creation time and use that over the code where currently needed.
