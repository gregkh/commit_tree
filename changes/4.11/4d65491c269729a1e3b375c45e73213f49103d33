target/iscsi: Fix unsolicited data seq_end_offset calculation

In case of unsolicited data for the first sequence
seq_end_offset must be set to minimum of total data length
and FirstBurstLength, so do not add cmd->write_data_done
to the min of total data length and FirstBurstLength.

This patch avoids that with ImmediateData=Yes, InitialR2T=No,
MaxXmitDataSegmentLength < FirstBurstLength that a WRITE command
with IO size above FirstBurstLength triggers sequence error
messages, for example

Set following parameters on target (linux-4.8.12)
ImmediateData = Yes
InitialR2T = No
MaxXmitDataSegmentLength = 8k
FirstBurstLength = 64k

Log in from Open iSCSI initiator and execute
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=128k count=1 oflag=direct

Error messages on target
Command ITT: 0x00000035 with Offset: 65536, Length: 8192 outside
of Sequence 73728:131072 while DataSequenceInOrder=Yes.
Command ITT: 0x00000035, received DataSN: 0x00000001 higher than
expected 0x00000000.
Unable to perform within-command recovery while ERL=0.
