PM / devfreq: Simplify the sysfs name of devfreq-event device

This patch just removes '.' character from the sysfs name of devfreq-event
device as following. Usually, the subsystem uses the similiar naming style
such as {framework name}{Number}.
- old : /sys/class/devfreq-event/event.(X)
- new : /sys/class/devfreq-event/event(X)

And this patch initializes the value of 'event_no' with -1
in order to remove the unneeded operation (-1) when calling
the atomic_inc_return(&event_no).

Lastly, this patch adds the ABI document for devfreq-event class.
