drm/i915: Remove i915_vma_create from VMA API

With the introduce of i915_vma_instance() for obtaining the VMA
singleton for a (obj, vm, view) tuple, we can remove the
i915_vma_create() in favour of a single entry point. We do incur a
lookup onto an empty tree, but the i915_vma_create() were being called
infrequently and during initialisation, so the small overhead is
negligible.

v2: Drop the i915_ prefix from the now static vma_create() function
