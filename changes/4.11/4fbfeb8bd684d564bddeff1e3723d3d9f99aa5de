usercopy: add testcases to check zeroing on failure

During usercopy the destination buffer will be zeroed if copy_from_user()
or get_user() fails. This patch adds testcases for it. The destination
buffer is set with non-zero value before illegal copy_from_user() or
get_user() is executed and the buffer is compared to zero after usercopy
is done.
