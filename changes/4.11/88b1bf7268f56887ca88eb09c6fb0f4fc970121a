powerpc/mm: Add missing global TLB invalidate if cxl is active

Commit 4c6d9acce1f4 ("powerpc/mm: Add hooks for cxl") converted local
TLB invalidates to global if the cxl driver is active. This is necessary
because the CAPP snoops invalidations to forward them to the PSL on the
cxl adapter. However one path was forgotten. native_flush_hash_range()
still does local TLB invalidates, as found out the hard way recently.

This patch fixes it by following the same logic as previously: if the
cxl driver is active, the local TLB invalidates are 'upgraded' to
global.
