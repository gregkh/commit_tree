virtio: allow drivers to request IRQ affinity when creating VQs

Add a struct irq_affinity pointer to the find_vqs methods, which if set
is used to tell the PCI layer to create the MSI-X vectors for our I/O
virtqueues with the proper affinity from the start.  Compared to after
the fact affinity hints this gives us an instantly working setup and
allows to allocate the irq descritors node-local and avoid interconnect
traffic.  Last but not least this will allow blk-mq queues are created
based on the interrupt affinity for storage drivers.
