blk-cgroup: don't quiesce the queue on policy activate/deactivate

There's no potential harm in quiescing the queue, but it also doesn't
buy us anything. And we can't run the queue async for policy
deactivate, since we could be in the path of tearing the queue down.
If we schedule an async run of the queue at that time, we're racing
with queue teardown AFTER having we've already torn most of it down.
