net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Abstract mv88e6165 PHY operations

The mv88e6165 family has the internal PHYs mapped directly onto the
SMI register space as the switch. So the registers can be read
directly. Put a wrapper around this, in preparation for changing the
signature in order to support the external MDIO bus of the 6390.
