IB/core: Expose vlan offloads capabilities

Expose raw packet capabilities in the core layer to enable a device
to report it.
Two existing capabilities, scatter FCS and IP CSUM were added to this
field for a better user experience by exposing the raw packet caps
from one location.
This field will serve also for future capabilities for raw packet QP.

A new capability was introduced - cvlan stripping, which is the
device's ability to remove cvlan tag from an incoming packet and
report it in the matching work completion.
