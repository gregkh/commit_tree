perf symbols: No need to check if sym->name is NULL

As it is an array, so will always evaluate to 'true', as reported by
clang:

  builtin-sched.c:2070:19: error: address of array 'sym->name' will always evaluate to 'true' [-Werror,-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                  if (sym && sym->name) {
                          ~~ ~~~~~^~~~
  1 warning generated.

So just ditch all those useless checks.
