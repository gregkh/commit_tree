arm: mvebu: support for SMP on 98DX3336 SoC

Compared to the armada-xp the 98DX3336 uses different registers to set
the boot address for the secondary CPU so a new enable-method is needed.
This will only work if the machine definition doesn't define an overall
smp_ops because there is not currently a way of overriding this from the
device tree if it is set in the machine definition.
