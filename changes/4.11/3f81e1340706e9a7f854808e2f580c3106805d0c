drm: mxsfb: Implement drm_panel handling

Currently when the 'power-supply' regulator is passed via device tree
it does not actually work since drm_panel_prepare()/drm_panel_enable()
are never called.

Quoting Thierry Reding: "It should really call drm_panel_prepare() and
drm_panel_enable() while switching on the display pipeline and
drm_panel_disable(), followed by drm_panel_unprepare() while switching
off the display pipeline."

So do as suggested, so that the 'power-supply' regulator can be functional.
