ALSA: seq: Don't break snd_use_lock_sync() loop by timeout

The snd_use_lock_sync() (thus its implementation
snd_use_lock_sync_helper()) has the 5 seconds timeout to break out of
the sync loop.  It was introduced from the beginning, just to be
"safer", in terms of avoiding the stupid bugs.

However, as Ben Hutchings suggested, this timeout rather introduces a
potential leak or use-after-free that was apparently fixed by the
commit 2d7d54002e39 ("ALSA: seq: Fix race during FIFO resize"):
for example, snd_seq_fifo_event_in() -> snd_seq_event_dup() ->
copy_from_user() could block for a long time, and snd_use_lock_sync()
goes timeout and still leaves the cell at releasing the pool.

For fixing such a problem, we remove the break by the timeout while
still keeping the warning.
