tty: serial: meson: allow baud-rates higher than 115200

The vendor driver allows setting baud-rates higher than 115200 baud.
There is a check in the vendor driver which prevents using more than
115200 baud during startup, however it does not have such a check in
.set_termios.
Higher baud-rates are often used by the bluetooth modules embedded into
the SDIO wifi chips (Amlogic devices use brcmfmac based wifi chips quite
often, 2000000 baud seems to be a common value for the UART baud-rate in
Amlogic's "libbt").

I have tested this on a Meson GXL device with uart_A (to which the
bluetooth module is connected, where initialization times out with
115200 baud) and uart_AO (which I manually set to 2000000 baud  and then
connected with my USB UART adapter to that).
