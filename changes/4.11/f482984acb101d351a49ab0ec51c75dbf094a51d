drm/i915: Compute sink's max lane count/link BW at Hotplug

Sink's capabilities are advertised through DPCD registers and get
updated only on hotplug. So they should be computed only once in the
long pulse handler and saved off in intel_dp structure for the use
later. For this reason two new fields max_sink_lane_count and
max_sink_link_bw are added to intel_dp structure.

This also simplifies the fallback link rate/lane count logic
to handle link training failure. In that case, the max_sink_link_bw
and max_sink_lane_count can be reccomputed to match the fallback
values lowering the sink capabilities due to link train failure.
