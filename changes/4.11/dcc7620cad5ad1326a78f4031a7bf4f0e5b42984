usb: host: xhci-plat: Fix timeout on removal of hot pluggable xhci controllers

Upstream commit 98d74f9ceaef ("xhci: fix 10 second timeout on removal of
PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers") fixes a problem with hot pluggable PCI
xhci controllers which can result in excessive timeouts, to the point where
the system reports a deadlock.

The same problem is seen with hot pluggable xhci controllers using the
xhci-plat driver, such as the driver used for Type-C ports on rk3399.
Similar to hot-pluggable PCI controllers, the driver for this chip
removes the xhci controller from the system when the Type-C cable is
disconnected.

The solution for PCI devices works just as well for non-PCI devices
and avoids the problem.
