MIPS: Octeon: Enable KASLR

This patch enables KASLR for Octeon systems. The SMP startup code is
such that the secondaries monitor the volatile variable
'octeon_processor_relocated_kernel_entry' for any non-zero value.
The 'plat_post_relocation hook' is used to set that value to the
kernel entry point of the relocated kernel. The secondary CPUs will
then jusmp to the new kernel, perform their initialization again
and begin waiting for the boot CPU to start them via the relocated
loop 'octeon_spin_wait_boot'. Inspired by Steven's code from Cavium.
