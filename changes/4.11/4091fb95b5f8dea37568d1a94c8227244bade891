scripts/spelling.txt: add "followings" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  followings||following

While we are here, add a missing colon in the boilerplate in DT binding
documents.  The "you SoC" in allwinner,sunxi-pinctrl.txt was fixed as
well.

I reworded "as the followings:" to "as follows:" for
drivers/usb/gadget/udc/renesas_usb3.c.
