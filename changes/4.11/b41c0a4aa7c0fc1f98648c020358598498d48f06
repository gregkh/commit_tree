scsi: megaraid_sas: set pd_after_lb from MR_BuildRaidContext and initialize pDevHandle to MR_DEVHANDLE_INVALID

Issue is limited for Syncro firmware where pd_after_lb is not set but is
accidentally used.  Not a functional issue, but results in low
performance due to improper load balancing between two LUNs.
