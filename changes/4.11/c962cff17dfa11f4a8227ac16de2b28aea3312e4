Revert "x86/acpi: Set persistent cpuid <-> nodeid mapping when booting"

Revert: dc6db24d2476 ("x86/acpi: Set persistent cpuid <-> nodeid mapping when booting")

The mapping of "cpuid <-> nodeid" is established at boot time via ACPI
tables to keep associations of workqueues and other node related items
consistent across cpu hotplug.

But, ACPI tables are unreliable and failures with that boot time mapping
have been reported on machines where the ACPI table and the physical
information which is retrieved at actual hotplug is inconsistent.

Revert the mapping implementation so it can be replaced with a less error
prone approach.
