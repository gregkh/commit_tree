x86/ras/therm_throt: Do not log a fake MCE for thermal events

We log a fake bank 128 MCE to note that we're handling a CPU thermal
event. However, this confuses people into thinking that their hardware
generates MCEs. Hijacking MCA for logging thermal events is a gross
misuse anyway and it shouldn't have been done in the first place. And
besides we have other means for dealing with thermal events which are
much more suitable.

So let's kill the MCE logging part.
