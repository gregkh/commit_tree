virtio_net: wrap rtnl_lock in test for calling with lock already held

For XDP use case and to allow ethtool reset tests it is useful to be
able to use reset paths from contexts where rtnl lock is already
held.

This requries updating virtnet_set_queues and free_receive_bufs the
two places where rtnl_lock is taken in virtio_net. To do this we
use the following pattern,

	_foo(...) { do stuff }
	foo(...) { rtnl_lock(); _foo(...); rtnl_unlock()};

this allows us to use freeze()/restore() flow from both contexts.
