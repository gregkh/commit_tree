clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Introduce generic errata handling infrastructure

Currently we have code inline in the arch timer probe path to cater for
Freescale erratum A-008585, complete with ifdeffery. This is a little
ugly, and will get worse as we try to add more errata handling.

This patch refactors the handling of Freescale erratum A-008585. Now the
erratum is described in a generic arch_timer_erratum_workaround
structure, and the probe path can iterate over these to detect errata
and enable workarounds.

This will simplify the addition and maintenance of code handling
Hisilicon erratum 161010101.
