lib/test_sort.c: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

     lib/Kconfig.debug:config TEST_SORT
     lib/Kconfig.debug:      bool "Array-based sort test"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the code there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular case,
the init ordering becomes slightly earlier when we change it to use
subsys_initcall as done here.  However, since it is a self contained
test, this shouldn't be an issue and subsys_initcall seems like a better
fit for this particular case.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag since that information is now
contained at the top of the file in the comments.
