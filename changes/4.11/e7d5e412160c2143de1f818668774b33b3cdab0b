phy: qcom-ufs: Don't kfree devres resource

Upon failing to acquire regulator supplies the qcom-ufs driver calls
kfree() on the devm allocated memory used to store the name of the
regulator, leading to devres corruption.

Rather than switching to using the appropriate free function the patch
acknowledge the fact that "name" is always a constant string and we
don't actually need to create a local copy of it, but rather just
reference the constant string.
