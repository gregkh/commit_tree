cifs: Simplify SMB2 and SMB311 dependencies

* CIFS_SMB2 depends on CIFS, which depends on INET and selects NLS. So
  these dependencies do not need to be repeated for CIFS_SMB2.
* CIFS_SMB311 depends on CIFS_SMB2, which depends on INET. So this
  dependency doesn't need to be repeated for CIFS_SMB311.
