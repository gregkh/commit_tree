drm/i915: Set guilty-flag on fence after detecting a hang

The struct dma_fence carries a status field exposed to userspace by
sync_file. This is inspected after the fence is signaled and can convey
whether or not the request completed successfully, or in our case if we
detected a hang during the request (signaled via -EIO in
SYNC_IOC_FILE_INFO).

v2: Mark all cancelled requests as failed.
