drm/i915/skl+: change WM calc to fixed point 16.16

This patch changes Watermak calculation to fixed point calculation.
Problem with current calculation is during plane_blocks_per_line
calculation we divide intermediate blocks with min_scanlines and
takes floor of the result because of integer operation.
hence we end-up assigning less blocks than required. Which leads to
flickers.

Changes since V1:
 - Add fixed point data type as per Paulo's review
Changes since V2:
 - use fixed_point instead of fp_16_16
Changes since V3:
 - rebase
Changes since V4 (from Paulo):
 - My original renaming suggestion was misunderstood, so implement it
 - Simplify fixed_16_16_to_u32 implementation
 - Fix indentation
