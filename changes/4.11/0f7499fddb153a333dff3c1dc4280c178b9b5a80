[media] rc-main: assign driver type during allocation

The driver type can be assigned immediately when an RC device
requests to the framework to allocate the device.

This is an 'enum rc_driver_type' data type and specifies whether
the device is a raw receiver or scancode receiver. The type will
be given as parameter to the rc_allocate_device device.

Change accordingly all the drivers calling rc_allocate_device()
so that the device type is specified during the rc device
allocation. Whenever the device type is not specified, it will be
set as RC_DRIVER_SCANCODE which was the default '0' value.
