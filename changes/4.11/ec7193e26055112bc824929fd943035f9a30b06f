qla2xxx: Fix delayed response to command for loop mode/direct connect.

Current driver wait for FW to be in the ready state before
processing in-coming commands. For Arbitrated Loop or
Point-to- Point (not switch), FW Ready state can take a while.
FW will transition to ready state after all Nports have been
logged in. In the mean time, certain initiators have completed
the login and starts IO. Driver needs to start processing all
queues if FW is already started.
