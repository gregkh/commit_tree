scsi: storvsc: Enable multi-queue support

Enable multi-q support. We will allocate the outgoing channel using
the following policy:

        1. We will make every effort to pick a channel that is in the
           same NUMA node that is initiating the I/O
        2. The mapping between the guest CPU and the outgoing channel
           is persistent.
