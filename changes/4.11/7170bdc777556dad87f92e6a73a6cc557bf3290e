MIPS: Add return errors to protected cache ops

The protected cache ops contain no out of line fixup code to return an
error code in the event of a fault, with the cache op being skipped in
that case. For KVM however we'd like to detect this case as page
faulting will be disabled so it could happen during normal operation if
the GVA page tables were flushed, and need to be handled by the caller.

Add the out-of-line fixup code to load the error value -EFAULT into the
return variable, and adapt the protected cache line functions to pass
the error back to the caller.
