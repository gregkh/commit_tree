net/mlx5e: Change the TC offload rule add/del code path to be per NIC or E-Switch

Refactor the code to deal with add/del TC rules to have handler per NIC/E-switch
offloading use case, and push the latter into the e-switch code. This provides
better separation and is to be used in down-stream patch for applying a fix.
