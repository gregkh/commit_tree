ath9k: fix race condition in enabling/disabling IRQs

The code currently relies on refcounting to disable IRQs from within the
IRQ handler and re-enabling them again after the tasklet has run.

However, due to race conditions sometimes the IRQ handler might be
called twice, or the tasklet may not run at all (if interrupted in the
middle of a reset).

This can cause nasty imbalances in the irq-disable refcount which will
get the driver permanently stuck until the entire radio has been stopped
and started again (ath_reset will not recover from this).

Instead of using this fragile logic, change the code to ensure that
running the irq handler during tasklet processing is safe, and leave the
refcount untouched.
