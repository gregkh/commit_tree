sched/headers, x86/apic: Remove the <linux/pm.h> header inclusion from <asm/apic.h>

We want to simplify <linux/sched.h>'s header dependencies, but one
roadblock to that is <asm/apic.h>'s inclusion of pm.h,
which brings in other, problematic headers.

Remove it, as it appears to be entirely spurious, apic.h does not
actually make use of any PM facilities.
