rtnl: don't account unused struct ifla_port_vsi in rtnl_port_size

When allocating rtnl dump messages, struct ifla_port_vsi is never dumped,
so we can save header plus payload in rtnl_port_size(). Infact, attribute
IFLA_PORT_VSI_TYPE and struct ifla_port_vsi are not used anywhere in
the kernel. We only need to keep the nla policy should applications in
user space be filling this out. Same NLA_BINARY issue exists as was fixed
in 364d5716a7ad ("rtnetlink: ifla_vf_policy: fix misuses of NLA_BINARY")
and others, but then again IFLA_PORT_VSI_TYPE is not used anywhere, so
just add a comment that it's unused.
