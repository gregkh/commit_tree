xen/privcmd: Add IOCTL_PRIVCMD_DM_OP

Recently a new dm_op[1] hypercall was added to Xen to provide a mechanism
for restricting device emulators (such as QEMU) to a limited set of
hypervisor operations, and being able to audit those operations in the
kernel of the domain in which they run.

This patch adds IOCTL_PRIVCMD_DM_OP as gateway for __HYPERVISOR_dm_op.

NOTE: There is no requirement for user-space code to bounce data through
      locked memory buffers (as with IOCTL_PRIVCMD_HYPERCALL) since
      privcmd has enough information to lock the original buffers
      directly.
