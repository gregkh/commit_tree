serial: st-asc: Read in all Pinctrl states

There are now 2 possible separate/different Pinctrl states which can
be provided from platform data.  One which encompasses the lines
required for HW flow-control (CTS/RTS) and another which does not
specify these lines, such that they can be used via GPIO mechanisms
for manually toggling (i.e. from a request by `stty`).
