crypto: atmel-sha - fix missing "return" instructions

This patch fixes a previous patch: "crypto: atmel-sha - update request
queue management to make it more generic".

Indeed the patch above should have replaced the "return -EINVAL;" lines by
"return atmel_sha_complete(dd, -EINVAL);" but instead replaced them by a
simple call of "atmel_sha_complete(dd, -EINVAL);".
Hence all "return" instructions were missing.
