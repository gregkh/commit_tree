i40e: remove unnecessary call to i40e_update_link_info

This call is made just prior to running i40e_link_event. In
i40e_link_event, we set hw->phy.get_link_info to true just prior to
calling i40e_get_link_status, which conveniently runs
i40e_update_link_info for us. Thus, we are running i40e_update_link_info
twice, which seems like something we don't need to do...
