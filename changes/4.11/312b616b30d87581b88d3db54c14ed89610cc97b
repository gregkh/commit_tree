kvm: x86: mmu: Set SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK within mmu.c

Instead of the caller including the SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK in the masks being
supplied to kvm_mmu_set_mmio_spte_mask() and kvm_mmu_set_mask_ptes(),
those functions now themselves include the SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK.

Note that bit 63 is now reset in the default MMIO mask.
