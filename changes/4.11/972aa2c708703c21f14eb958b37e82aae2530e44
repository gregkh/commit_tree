ALSA: hda - Apply ALC269_FIXUP_NO_SHUTUP on HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PROBE

Setting shutup when the action is HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE might
not have the desired effect since it could be overridden by
another more generic shutup function. Prevent this by setting
the more specific shutup function on HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PROBE.
