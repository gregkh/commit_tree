sctp: remove useless code from sctp_apply_peer_addr_params

sctp_frag_point() doesn't store anything, and thus just calling it
cannot do anything useful.

sctp_apply_peer_addr_params is only called by
sctp_setsockopt_peer_addr_params. When operating on an asoc,
sctp_setsockopt_peer_addr_params will call sctp_apply_peer_addr_params
once for the asoc, and then once for each transport this asoc has,
meaning that the frag_point will be recomputed when updating the
transports and calling it when updating the asoc is not necessary.
IOW, no action is needed here and we can remove this call.
