fpga zynq: Use the scatterlist interface

This allows the driver to avoid a high order coherent DMA allocation
and memory copy. With this patch it can DMA directly from the kernel
pages that the bitfile is stored in.

Since this is now a gather DMA operation the driver uses the ISR
to feed the chips DMA queue with each entry from the SGL.
