KVM: PPC: Book 3S: XICS: Fix potential issue with duplicate IRQ resends

It is possible that in the following order, one irq is resent twice:

        CPU 1                                   CPU 2

ics_check_resend()
  lock ics_lock
    see resend set
  unlock ics_lock
                                       /* change affinity of the irq */
                                       kvmppc_xics_set_xive()
                                         write_xive()
                                           lock ics_lock
                                             see resend set
                                           unlock ics_lock

                                         icp_deliver_irq() /* resend */

  icp_deliver_irq() /* resend again */

It doesn't have any user-visible effect at present, but needs to be avoided
when the following patch implementing the P/Q stuff is applied.

This patch clears the resend flag before releasing the ics lock, when we
know we will do a re-delivery after checking the flag, or setting the flag.
