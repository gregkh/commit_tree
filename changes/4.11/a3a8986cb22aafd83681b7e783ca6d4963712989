drm/i915/bxt: IPC WA for Broxton

Display Workarounds #1135
If IPC is enabled in BXT, display underruns are observed.
WA: The Line Time programmed in the WM_LINETIME register should be
half of the actual calculated Line Time.

Programmed Line Time = 1/2*Calculated Line Time

Changes since V1:
 - Add Workaround number in commit & code
Changes since V2 (from Paulo):
 - Bikeshed white space and make the WA tag look like the others
