net/mlx5e: XDP Tx, no inline copy on ConnectX-5

ConnectX-5 and later HW generations will report min inline mode ==
MLX5_INLINE_MODE_NONE, which means driver is not required to copy packet
headers to inline fields of TX WQE.

Avoid copy to inline segment in XDP TX routine when HW inline mode doesn't
require it.

This will improve CPU utilization and boost XDP TX performance.

Tested with xdp2 single flow:
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz
HCA: Mellanox Technologies MT28800 Family [ConnectX-5 Ex]

Before: 7.4Mpps
After:  7.8Mpps
Improvement: 5%
