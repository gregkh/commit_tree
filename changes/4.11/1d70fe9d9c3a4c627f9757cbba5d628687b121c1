tpm_tis: use default timeout value if chip reports it as zero

Since commit 1107d065fdf1 ("tpm_tis: Introduce intermediate layer for
TPM access") Atmel 3203 TPM on ThinkPad X61S (TPM firmware version 13.9)
no longer works.  The initialization proceeds fine until we get and
start using chip-reported timeouts - and the chip reports C and D
timeouts of zero.

It turns out that until commit 8e54caf407b98e ("tpm: Provide a generic
means to override the chip returned timeouts") we had actually let
default timeout values remain in this case, so let's bring back this
behavior to make chips like Atmel 3203 work again.

Use a common code that was introduced by that commit so a warning is
printed in this case and /sys/class/tpm/tpm*/timeouts correctly says the
timeouts aren't chip-original.
