pc104: Introduce the PC104 Kconfig option

PC/104 form factor devices serve a specific niche of embedded system
users; most Linux users will not have PC/104 form factor devices. This
patch introduces the PC104 Kconfig option, which should be used to
filter PC/104 specific device drivers and options, so that only those
users interested in PC/104 related options are exposed to them.
