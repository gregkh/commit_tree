block: fold cmd_type into the REQ_OP_ space

Instead of keeping two levels of indirection for requests types, fold it
all into the operations.  The little caveat here is that previously
cmd_type only applied to struct request, while the request and bio op
fields were set to plain REQ_OP_READ/WRITE even for passthrough
operations.

Instead this patch adds new REQ_OP_* for SCSI passthrough and driver
private requests, althought it has to add two for each so that we
can communicate the data in/out nature of the request.
