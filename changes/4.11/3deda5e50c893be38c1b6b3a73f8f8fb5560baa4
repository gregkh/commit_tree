KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't try to signal cpu -1

If the target vcpu for kvmppc_fast_vcpu_kick_hv() is not running on
any CPU, then we will have vcpu->arch.thread_cpu == -1, and as it
happens, kvmppc_fast_vcpu_kick_hv will call kvmppc_ipi_thread with
-1 as the cpu argument.  Although this is not meaningful, in the past,
before commit 1704a81ccebc ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Use msgsnd for IPIs
to other cores on POWER9", 2016-11-18), it was harmless because CPU
-1 is not in the same core as any real CPU thread.  On a POWER9,
however, we don't do the "same core" check, so we were trying to
do a msgsnd to thread -1, which is invalid.  To avoid this, we add
a check to see that vcpu->arch.thread_cpu is >= 0 before calling
kvmppc_ipi_thread() with it.  Since vcpu->arch.thread_vcpu can change
asynchronously, we use READ_ONCE to ensure that the value we check is
the same value that we use as the argument to kvmppc_ipi_thread().
