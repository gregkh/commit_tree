x86/mm/cpa: Avoid wbinvd() for PREEMPT

Although wbinvd() is faster than flushing many individual pages, it blocks
the memory bus for "long" periods of time (>100us), thus directly causing
unusually large latencies on all CPUs, regardless of any CPU isolation
features that may be active. This is an unpriviledged operatation as it is
exposed to user space via the graphics subsystem.

For 1024 pages, flushing those pages individually can take up to 2200us,
but the task remains fully preemptible during that time.
