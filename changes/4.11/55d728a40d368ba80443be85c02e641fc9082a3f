efi/fb: Avoid reconfiguration of BAR that covers the framebuffer

On UEFI systems, the PCI subsystem is enumerated by the firmware,
and if a graphical framebuffer is exposed via a PCI device, its base
address and size are exposed to the OS via the Graphics Output
Protocol (GOP).

On arm64 PCI systems, the entire PCI hierarchy is reconfigured from
scratch at boot. This may result in the GOP framebuffer address to
become stale, if the BAR covering the framebuffer is modified. This
will cause the framebuffer to become unresponsive, and may in some
cases result in unpredictable behavior if the range is reassigned to
another device.

So add a non-x86 quirk to the EFI fb driver to find the BAR associated
with the GOP base address, and claim the BAR resource so that the PCI
core will not move it.
