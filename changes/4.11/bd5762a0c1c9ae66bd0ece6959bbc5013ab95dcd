platform/x86: intel-hid: Support 5 button array

New firmwares include a feature called 5 button array that supports
super key, volume up/down, rotation lock and power button. Support
for this feature is required to fix power button on some recent
systems.

This patch was tested on a Dell Latitude 7480.
