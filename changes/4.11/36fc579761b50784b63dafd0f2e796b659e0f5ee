drm/edid: Add EDID_QUIRK_FORCE_8BPC quirk for Rotel RSX-1058

Rotel RSX-1058 is a receiver with 4 HDMI inputs and a HDMI output, all
1.1.

When a sink that supports deep color is connected to the output, the
receiver will send EDIDs that advertise this capability, even if it
isn't possible with HDMI versions earlier than 1.3.

Currently the kernel is assuming that deep color is possible and the
sink displays an error.

This quirk will make sure that deep color isn't used with this
particular receiver.
