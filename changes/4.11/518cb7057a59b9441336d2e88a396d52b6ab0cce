drm/bridge: adv7511: Use work_struct to defer hotplug handing to out of irq context

I was recently seeing issues with EDID probing, where
the logic to wait for the EDID read bit to be set by the
IRQ wasn't happening and the code would time out and fail.

Digging deeper, I found this was due to the fact that
IRQs were disabled as we were running in IRQ context from
the HPD signal.

Thus this patch changes the logic to handle the HPD signal
via a work_struct so we can be out of irq context.

With this patch, the EDID probing on hotplug does not time
out.
