PCI: hisi: Add DT almost-ECAM support for Hip06/Hip07 host controllers

The PCIe controller in HiSilicon Hip06/Hip07 SoCs is not completely
ECAM-compliant.  It is non-ECAM only for the RC bus config space; for any
other bus underneath the root bus it does support ECAM access.

Add DT support for the almost-ECAM Hip06/Hip07 controllers.
