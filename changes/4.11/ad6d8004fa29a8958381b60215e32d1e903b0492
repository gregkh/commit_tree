gpio: mockup: dynamically allocate memory for chip name

Currently the chip name buffer is allocated on the stack and the
address of the buffer is passed to the gpio framework. It's invalid
after probe() returns, so the sysfs label attribute displays garbage.

Use devm_kasprintf() for each string instead.
