ARM: dts: NSP: Add QSPI support to missing boards

QSPI device tree entries are present in bcm958625k, but missing from
bcm958522er, bcm958525er, bcm958525xmc, bcm958622hr, bcm958623hr,
bcm958625hr, and bcm988312hr.  Duplicate the entry in bcm958625k for
all of those that are missing it (as they are identical).
