Revert "rfkill: Add rfkill-any LED trigger"

This reverts commit 73f4f76a196d7adb11a1e192bd8024fe0bc83910.

As Mike reported, and I should've seen in review, we can't call
the new LED functions, which acquire the mutex, from places like
rfkill_set_sw_state() that are documented to be callable from
any context the user likes to use. For Mike's case it led to a
deadlock, but other scenarios are possible.
