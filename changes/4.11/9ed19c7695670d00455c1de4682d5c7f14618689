selftests: ftrace: Add check for function-fork before running pid filter test

Have the func-filter-pid test check for the function-fork option before
testing it. It can still test the pid filtering, but will stop before
testing the function-fork option for children inheriting the pids.
This allows the test to be added before the function-fork feature, but after
a bug fix that triggers one of the bugs the test can cause.
