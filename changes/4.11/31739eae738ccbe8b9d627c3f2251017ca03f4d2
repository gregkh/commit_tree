net: bcmgenet: remove bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup()

Commit 6ac3ce8295e6 ("net: bcmgenet: Remove excessive PHY reset")
removed the bcmgenet_mii_reset() function from bcmgenet_power_up() and
bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() functions.  In so doing it broke the reset
of the internal PHY devices used by the GENETv1-GENETv3 which required
this reset before the UniMAC was enabled.  It also broke the internal
GPHY devices used by the GENETv4 because the config_init that installed
the AFE workaround was no longer occurring after the reset of the GPHY
performed by bcmgenet_phy_power_set() in bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup().
In addition the code in bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() related to the
"enable APD" comment goes with the bcmgenet_mii_reset() so it should
have also been removed.

Commit bd4060a6108b ("net: bcmgenet: Power on integrated GPHY in
bcmgenet_power_up()") moved the bcmgenet_phy_power_set() call to the
bcmgenet_power_up() function, but failed to remove it from the
bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() function.  Had it done so, the
bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() function would have been empty and could
have been removed at that time.

Commit 5dbebbb44a6a ("net: bcmgenet: Software reset EPHY after power on")
was submitted to correct the functional problems introduced by
commit 6ac3ce8295e6 ("net: bcmgenet: Remove excessive PHY reset"). It
was included in v4.4 and made available on 4.3-stable. Unfortunately,
it didn't fully revert the commit because this bcmgenet_mii_reset()
doesn't apply the soft reset to the internal GPHY used by GENETv4 like
the previous one did. This prevents the restoration of the AFE work-
arounds for internal GPHY devices after the bcmgenet_phy_power_set() in
bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup().

This commit takes the alternate approach of removing the unnecessary
bcmgenet_internal_phy_setup() function which shouldn't have been in v4.3
so that when bcmgenet_mii_reset() was restored it should have only gone
into bcmgenet_power_up().  This will avoid the problems while also
removing the redundancy (and hopefully some of the confusion).
