powerpc/kernel: Remove error message in pcibios_setup_phb_resources()

The CAPI driver creates virtual PHB (vPHB) from the CAPI adapter.
The vPHB's IO and memory windows aren't built from device-tree node
as we do for normal PHBs. A error message is thrown in below path
when trying to probe AFUs contained in the adapter. The error message
is confusing and unnecessary.

    cxl_probe()
    pci_init_afu()
    cxl_pci_vphb_add()
    pcibios_scan_phb()
    pcibios_setup_phb_resources()

This removes the error message. We might have the case where the
first memory window on real PHB isn't populated properly because
of error in "ranges" property in the device-tree node. We can check
the device-tree instead for that. This also removes one unnecessary
blank line in the function.
