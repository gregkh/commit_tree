drm: Resurrect atomic rmfb code, v3

This was somehow lost between v3 and the merged version in Maarten's
patch merged as:

commit f2d580b9a8149735cbc4b59c4a8df60173658140
Author: Maarten Lankhorst <maarten.lankhorst@linux.intel.com>

    drm/core: Do not preserve framebuffer on rmfb, v4.

This introduces a slight behavioral change to rmfb. Instead of
disabling a crtc when the primary plane is disabled, we try to
preserve it.

Apart from old versions of the vmwgfx xorg driver, there is
nothing depending on rmfb disabling a crtc. Since vmwgfx is
a legacy driver we can safely only disable the plane with atomic.

If this commit is rejected by the driver then we will still fall
back to the old behavior and turn off the crtc.

v2:
- Remove plane->fb assignment, done by drm_atomic_clean_old_fb.
- Add WARN_ON when atomic_remove_fb fails.
- Always call drm_atomic_state_put.
v3:
- Use drm_drv_uses_atomic_modeset
- Handle the case where the first plane-disable-only commit fails
  with -EINVAL. Some drivers do not support this, fall back to
  disabling all crtc's in this case.
