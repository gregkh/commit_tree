ARM: dts: reference PM8058 as IRQ parent

Some nodes are referencing the pm8058_gpio as IRQ parent, but
the HW IRQ offset they are supplying is actually that for the
parent to that controller: the PM8058 itself. Since that is the
proper parent, reference it directly.

We can switch this to the pm8058_gpio and the proper offset
once we have fixed the SSBI GPIO driver to properly deal with
the hierarchical IRQ domain and get proper local offset
translation.
