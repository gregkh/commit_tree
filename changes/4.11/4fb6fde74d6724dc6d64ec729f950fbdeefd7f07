EDAC: Expose per-DIMM error counts in sysfs

The old csrowX sysfs directories have per-csrow error counters, but the
new dimmX directories do not currently expose error counts.

EDAC already keeps these counts, add them to sysfs so per-DIMM counts
are still available when CONFIG_EDAC_LEGACY_SYSFS=n.
