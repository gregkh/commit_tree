scsi_transport_sas: fix BSG ioctl memory corruption

The end_device and sas_host devices support BSG ioctls, but the
request_queue allocated for them isn't set up to allocate the struct
scsi_request payload. This leads to memory corruption in the call to
scsi_req_init() in bsg_map_hdr(), since it will memset past the end of
the allocated request. Fix it by setting ->cmd_size on the allocated
request_queue.
