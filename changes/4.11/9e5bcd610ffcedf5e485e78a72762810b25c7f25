mm/migration: make isolate_movable_page() return int type

Patch series "HWPOISON: soft offlining for non-lru movable page", v6.

After Minchan's commit bda807d44454 ("mm: migrate: support non-lru
movable page migration"), some type of non-lru page like zsmalloc and
virtio-balloon page also support migration.

Therefore, we can:

1) soft offlining no-lru movable pages, which means when memory
   corrected errors occur on a non-lru movable page, we can stop to use
   it by migrating data onto another page and disable the original
   (maybe half-broken) one.

2) enable memory hotplug for non-lru movable pages, i.e. we may offline
   blocks, which include such pages, by using non-lru page migration.

This patchset is heavily dependent on non-lru movable page migration.

This patch (of 4):

Change the return type of isolate_movable_page() from bool to int.  It
will return 0 when isolate movable page successfully, and return -EBUSY
when it isolates failed.

There is no functional change within this patch but prepare for later
patch.
