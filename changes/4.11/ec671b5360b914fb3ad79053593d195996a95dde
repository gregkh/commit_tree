remoteproc: qcom: fix initializers for qcom_mss_reg_res array

The recently added initialization is rather unusual because it uses a constructor for
a variable-length array to assign a constant structure to a member that uses a fixed-length
array. This confuses clang and breaks the build.

drivers/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5_pil.c:1024:18: error: incompatible pointer types initializing 'const char *' with an expression of type
:%s      'struct qcom_mss_reg_res [4]' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
        .proxy_supply = (struct qcom_mss_reg_res[]) {
                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5_pil.c:1024:18: warning: suggest braces around initialization of subobject [-Wmissing-braces]
        .proxy_supply = (struct qcom_mss_reg_res[]) {
                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can either turn this constructor into a regular initializer by removing
the 'struct qcom_mss_reg_res[])', or we can make the array variable length.

The latter approach is used for the arrays of strings in the same structure,
so let's use that here too.
