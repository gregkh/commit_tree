scsi: remove eh_timed_out methods in the transport template

Instead define the timeout behavior purely based on the host_template
eh_timed_out method and wire up the existing transport implementations
in the host templates.  This also clears up the confusion that the
transport template method overrides the host template one, so some
drivers have to re-override the transport template one.
