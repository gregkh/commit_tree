drm/amd/amdgpu: move eviction counting to amdgpu_bo_move_notify

This catches evictions of shadow page tables from the GART. Since shadow
page tables are always stored in system memory, amdgpu_bo_move is never
called for them.

This fixes a crash during command submission that occurs when only a shadow
page table and no other BOs were evicted since the last submission.
