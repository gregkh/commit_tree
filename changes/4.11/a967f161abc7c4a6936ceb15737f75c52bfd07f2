powerpc/mm: Return directly after a failed __copy_from_user() in sys_subpage_prot()

This function already has multiple exit points, so there's no harm
adding another. Although it looks odd to return directly in a function
which takes a lock, we've actually just dropped the mmap_sem in this
code, so there's really no reason to go via a label. And it means we can
drop the unhelpfully named out2 label.
