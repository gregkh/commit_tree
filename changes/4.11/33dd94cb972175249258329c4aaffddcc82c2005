iio:buffer.h - split into buffer.h and buffer_impl.h

buffer.h supplies everything needed for devices using buffers.
buffer_impl.h supplies access to the internals as needed to write
a buffer implementation.

This was really motivated by the mess that turned up in the
kernel-doc documentation pulled in by the new sphinx docs.
It made it clear that our logical separations in headers were
generally terrible.  The buffer case was easy to sort out without
greatly effecting drivers so here it is.
