x86/mm: Remove CONFIG_DEBUG_NX_TEST

CONFIG_DEBUG_NX_TEST has been broken since CONFIG_DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX=y
was added in v2.6.37 via:

  84e1c6bb38eb ("x86: Add RO/NX protection for loadable kernel modules")

since the exception table was then made read-only.

Additionally, the manually constructed extables were never fixed when
relative extables were introduced in v3.5 via:

  706276543b69 ("x86, extable: Switch to relative exception table entries")

However, relative extables won't work for test_nx.c, since test instruction
memory areas may be more than INT_MAX away from an executable fixup
(e.g. stack and heap too far away from executable memory with the fixup).

Since clearly no one has been using this code for a while now, and similar
tests exist in LKDTM, this should just be removed entirely.
