drm/i915: Store required fence size/alignment for GGTT vma

The fence size/alignment is a combination of the vma size plus object
tiling parameters. Those parameters are rarely changed, making the fence
size/alignemnt roughly constant for the lifetime of the VMA. We can
simplify subsequent calculations by precalculating the size/alignment
required for GGTT vma taking fencing into account (with an update if we
do change the tiling or stride).
