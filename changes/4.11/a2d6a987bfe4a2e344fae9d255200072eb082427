serial: 8250: Add new port type for TI DA8xx/66AK2x

This adds a new UART port type for TI DA8xx/OMAPL13x/AM17xx/AM18xx/66AK2x.
These SoCs have standard 8250 registers plus some extra non-standard
registers.

The UART will not function unless the non-standard Power and Emulation
Management Register (PWREMU_MGMT) is configured correctly. This is
currently handled in arch/arm/mach-davinci/serial.c for non-device-tree
boards. Making this part of the UART driver will allow UART to work on
device-tree boards as well and the mach code can eventually be removed.
