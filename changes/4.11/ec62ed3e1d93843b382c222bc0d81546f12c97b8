drm/i915: Restore context and pd for ringbuffer submission after reset

Following a reset, the context and page directory registers are lost.
However, the queue of requests that we resubmit after the reset may
depend upon them - the registers are restored from a context image, but
that restore may be inhibited and may simply be absent from the request
if it was in the middle of a sequence using the same context. If we
prime the CCID/PD registers with the first request in the queue (even
for the hung request), we prevent invalid memory access for the
following requests (and continually hung engines).

v2: Magic BIT(8), reserved for future use but still appears unused.
v3: Some commentary on handling innocent vs guilty requests
v4: Add a wait for PD_BASE fetch. The reload appears to be instant on my
Ivybridge, but this bit probably exists for a reason.
