afs: Use core kernel UUID generation

AFS uses a time based UUID to identify the host itself.  This requires
getting a timestamp which is currently done through the getnstimeofday()
interface that we want to eventually get rid of.

Instead of replacing it with a ktime-based interface, simply remove the
entire function and use generate_random_uuid() instead, which has a v4
("completely random") UUID instead of the time-based one.
