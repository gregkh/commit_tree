Revert "ACPICA: Resources: Not a valid resource if buffer length too long"

Revert commit 57707a9a7780 (ACPICA: Resources: Not a valid resource if
buffer length too long) as it is reported to prevent the TPM module
from loading on Lenovo X60 with Coreboot.

It also causes new confusing warnings to show up in the kernel log.
