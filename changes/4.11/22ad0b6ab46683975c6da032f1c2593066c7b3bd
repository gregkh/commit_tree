f2fs: add bitmaps for empty or full NAT blocks

This patches adds bitmaps to represent empty or full NAT blocks containing
free nid entries.

If we can find valid crc|cp_ver in the last block of checkpoint pack, we'll
use these bitmaps when building free nids. In order to avoid checkpointing
burden, up-to-date bitmaps will be flushed only during umount time. So,
normally we can get this gain, but when power-cut happens, we rely on fsck.f2fs
which recovers this bitmap again.

After this patch, we build free nids from nid #0 at mount time to make more
full NAT blocks, but in runtime, we check empty NAT blocks to load free nids
without loading any NAT pages from disk.
