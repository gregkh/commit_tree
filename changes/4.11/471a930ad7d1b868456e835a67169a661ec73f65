SUNRPC: Drop all entries from cache_detail when cache_purge()

User always free the cache_detail after sunrpc_destroy_cache_detail(),
so, it must cleanup up entries that left in the cache_detail,
otherwise, NULL reference may be caused when using the left entries.

Also, NeriBrown suggests "write a stand-alone cache_purge()."

v3, move the cache_fresh_unlocked() out of write lock,
v2, a stand-alone cache_purge(), not only for sunrpc_destroy_cache_detail
