s390: provide sclp based boot console

Use the early sclp code to provide a boot console. This boot console
is available if the kernel parameter "earlyprintk" has been specified,
just like it works for other architectures that also provide an early
boot console.

This makes debugging of early problems much easier, since now we
finally have working console output even before memory detection is
running.

The boot console will be automatically disabled as soon as another
console will be registered.
