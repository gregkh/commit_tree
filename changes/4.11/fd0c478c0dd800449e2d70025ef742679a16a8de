nvmem: core: Allow getting nvmem cell with a NULL cell id

The nvmem cell with a NULL cell name/id should be the one
with no accompanying 'nvmem-cell-names' property, and thus
will be the cell at index 0 in the device tree.
So, we default to index 0 and update the cell index only when
nvmem cell name id exists.
