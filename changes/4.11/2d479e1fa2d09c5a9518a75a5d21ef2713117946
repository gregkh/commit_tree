device property: export code duplicating array of property entries

When augmenting ACPI-enumerated devices with additional property data based
on DMI info, a module has often several potential property sets, with only
one being active on a given box. In order to save memory it should be
possible to mark everything and __initdata or __initconst, execute DMI
match early, and duplicate relevant properties. Then kernel will discard
the rest of them.
