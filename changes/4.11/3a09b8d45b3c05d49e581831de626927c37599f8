sched/Documentation/sched-rt-group: Fix incorrect example

I feel that the example given in the document to show the possibility
of task starvation of configurable period is wrong.

The example says group A and B both have 50% bandwidth, and a while (1)
loop in A will run for the full period of B and can starve B's tasks.

So I think the runtime of group A should be 50000us, then the period and
runtime of group B should be 50000us and 25000us.
