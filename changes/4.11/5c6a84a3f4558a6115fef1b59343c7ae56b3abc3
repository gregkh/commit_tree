mm/kasan: Switch to using __pa_symbol and lm_alias

__pa_symbol is the correct API to find the physical address of symbols.
Switch to it to allow for debugging APIs to work correctly. Other
functions such as p*d_populate may call __pa internally. Ensure that the
address passed is in the linear region by calling lm_alias.
