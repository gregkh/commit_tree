KVM: PPC: Book3S: 64-bit CONFIG_RELOCATABLE support for interrupts

64-bit Book3S exception handlers must find the dynamic kernel base
to add to the target address when branching beyond __end_interrupts,
in order to support kernel running at non-0 physical address.

Support this in KVM by branching with CTR, similarly to regular
interrupt handlers. The guest CTR saved in HSTATE_SCRATCH1 and
restored after the branch.

Without this, the host kernel hangs and crashes randomly when it is
running at a non-0 address and a KVM guest is started.
