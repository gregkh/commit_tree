ARM: OMAP5: Add HWMOD_SWSUP_SIDLE_ACT flag for UART

According to the commit ca43ea345de9 ("ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Add a new
flag to handle SIDLE in SWSUP only in active"), UART IP needs the sidle
mode to be controlled in SW only while they are active. Once inactive,
the IP needs to be put back in HW control so they are also wakeup
capable. The flag HWMOD_SWSUP_SIDLE takes care of this. So add this flag
to all instances of UART.

With this change, 8250 UART now gives out proper RX Timeout interrupts
and is usable as console.
