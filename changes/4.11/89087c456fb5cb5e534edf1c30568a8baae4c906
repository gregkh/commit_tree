bpf: Fix values type used in test_maps

Maps of per-cpu type have their value element size adjusted to 8 if it
is specified smaller during various map operations.

This makes test_maps as a 32-bit binary fail, in fact the kernel
writes past the end of the value's array on the user's stack.

To be quite honest, I think the kernel should reject creation of a
per-cpu map that doesn't have a value size of at least 8 if that's
what the kernel is going to silently adjust to later.

If the user passed something smaller, it is a sizeof() calcualtion
based upon the type they will actually use (just like in this testcase
code) in later calls to the map operations.
