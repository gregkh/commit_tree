inet: collapse ipv4/v6 rcv_saddr_equal functions into one

We pass these per-protocol equal functions around in various places, but
we can just have one function that checks the sk->sk_family and then do
the right comparison function.  I've also changed the ipv4 version to
not cast to inet_sock since it is unneeded.
