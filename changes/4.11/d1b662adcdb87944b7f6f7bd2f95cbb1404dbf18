bpf: allow option for setting bpf_l4_csum_replace from scratch

When programs need to calculate the csum from scratch for small UDP
packets and use bpf_l4_csum_replace() to feed the result from helpers
like bpf_csum_diff(), then we need a flag besides BPF_F_MARK_MANGLED_0
that would ignore the case of current csum being 0, and which would
still allow for the helper to set the csum and transform when needed
to CSUM_MANGLED_0.
