net: ipv6: Remove redundant RTA_OIF in multipath routes

Dinesh reported that RTA_MULTIPATH nexthops are 8-bytes larger with IPv6
than IPv4. The recent refactoring for multipath support in netlink
messages does discriminate between non-multipath which needs the OIF
and multipath which adds a rtnexthop struct for each hop making the
RTA_OIF attribute redundant. Resolve by adding a flag to the info
function to skip the oif for multipath.
