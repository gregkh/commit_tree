drm/i915: skip the first 4k of stolen memory on everything >= gen8

BSpec got updated and this workaround is now listed as standard
required programming for all subsequent projects. This is confirmed to
fix Skylake screen flickering issues (probably caused by the fact that
we initialized a ring in the first page of stolen, but I didn't 100%
confirm this theory).

v2: this is the patch that fixes the screen flickering, document it.
