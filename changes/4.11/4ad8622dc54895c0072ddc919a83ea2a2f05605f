powerpc/8xx: Implement hw_breakpoint

This patch implements HW breakpoint on the 8xx. The 8xx has
capability to manage HW breakpoints, which is slightly different
than BOOK3S:
1/ The breakpoint match doesn't trigger a DSI exception but a
dedicated data breakpoint exception.
2/ The breakpoint happens after the instruction has completed,
no need to single step or emulate the instruction,
3/ Matched address is not set in DAR but in BAR,
4/ DABR register doesn't exist, instead we have registers
LCTRL1, LCTRL2 and CMPx registers,
5/ The match on one comparator is not on a double word but
on a single word.

The patch does:
1/ Prepare the dedicated registers in call to __set_dabr(). In order
to emulate the double word handling of BOOK3S, comparator E is set to
DABR address value and comparator F to address + 4. Then breakpoint 1
is set to match comparator E or F,
2/ Skip the singlestepping stage when compiled for CONFIG_PPC_8xx,
3/ Implement the exception. In that exception, the matched address
is taken from SPRN_BAR and manage as if it was from SPRN_DAR.
4/ I/D TLB error exception routines perform a tlbie on bad TLBs. That
tlbie triggers the breakpoint exception when performed on the
breakpoint address. For this reason, the routine returns if the match
is from one of those two tlbie.
