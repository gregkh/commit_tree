cpufreq: Do not clear real_cpus mask on policy init

If new_policy is set in cpufreq_online(), the policy object has just
been created and its real_cpus mask has been zeroed on allocation,
and the driver's ->init() callback should not touch it.

It doesn't need to be cleared again, so don't do that.
