ARM: dts: exynos: Fix initial audio clocks configuration on Exynos4 boards

Move assigned clocks properties from sound node to audio subsystem clock
controller node. This way clocks topology and rates are set just after
probing audio clocks controller. Leaving those properties under
sound node doesn't guarantee to configure them before they are being used
(for example i2s hardware module can be probed in parallel and it also
require proper audio clocks configuration).
