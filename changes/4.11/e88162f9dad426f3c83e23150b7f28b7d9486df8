Revert "i2c: mux: pca954x: Add ACPI support for pca954x"

In ACPI world any ID should be carefully chosen and registered
officially. The commit bbf9d262a147 seems did a wrong assumption because
PCA is the registered PNP ID for "PHILIPS BU ADD ON CARD". I'm pretty
sure this prefix has nothing to do with the driver in question.

Moreover, newer ACPI specification has a support of _DSD method and
special device IDs to allow drivers be enumerated via compatible string.
The slight change to support this kind of enumeration will be added in
sequential patch against pca954x.c.

Revert the commit bbf9d262a147 for good.
