IB/rxe: increment msn only when completing a request

According to C9-147, MSN should only be incremented when the last packet of
a multi packet request has been received.

"Logically, the requester associates a sequential Send Sequence Number
(SSN) with each WQE posted to the send queue. The SSN bears a one-
to-one relationship to the MSN returned by the responder in each re-
sponse packet. Therefore, when the requester receives a response, it in-
terprets the MSN as representing the SSN of the most recent request
completed by the responder to determine which send WQE(s) can be
completed."
