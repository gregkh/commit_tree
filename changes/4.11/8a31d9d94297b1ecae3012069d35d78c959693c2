PM / OPP: Update OPP users to put reference

This patch updates dev_pm_opp_find_freq_*() routines to get a reference
to the OPPs returned by them.

Also updates the users of dev_pm_opp_find_freq_*() routines to call
dev_pm_opp_put() after they are done using the OPPs.

As it is guaranteed the that OPPs wouldn't get freed while being used,
the RCU read side locking present with the users isn't required anymore.
Drop it as well.

This patch also updates all users of devfreq_recommended_opp() which was
returning an OPP received from the OPP core.

Note that some of the OPP core routines have gained
rcu_read_{lock|unlock}() calls, as those still use RCU specific APIs
within them.
