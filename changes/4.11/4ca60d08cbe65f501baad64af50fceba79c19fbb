netfilter: bridge: honor frag_max_size when refragmenting

consider a bridge with mtu 9000, but end host sending smaller
packets to another host with mtu < 9000.

In this case, after reassembly, bridge+defrag would refragment,
and then attempt to send the reassembled packet as long as it
was below 9k.

Instead we have to cap by the largest fragment size seen.
