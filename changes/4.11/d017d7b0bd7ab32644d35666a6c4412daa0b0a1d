KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Implement VGICv3 CPU interface access

VGICv3 CPU interface registers are accessed using
KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CPU_SYSREGS ioctl. These registers are accessed
as 64-bit. The cpu MPIDR value is passed along with register id.
It is used to identify the cpu for registers access.

The VM that supports SEIs expect it on destination machine to handle
guest aborts and hence checked for ICC_CTLR_EL1.SEIS compatibility.
Similarly, VM that supports Affinity Level 3 that is required for AArch64
mode, is required to be supported on destination machine. Hence checked
for ICC_CTLR_EL1.A3V compatibility.

The arch/arm64/kvm/vgic-sys-reg-v3.c handles read and write of VGIC
CPU registers for AArch64.

For AArch32 mode, arch/arm/kvm/vgic-v3-coproc.c file is created but
APIs are not implemented.

Updated arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h with new definitions
required to compile for AArch32.

The version of VGIC v3 specification is defined here
