drm/bridge: adv7511: Reuse __adv7511_power_on/off() when probing EDID

Thus this patch changes the EDID probing logic so that we
re-use the __adv7511_power_on/off() calls instead of duplciating
logic.

This does change behavior slightly as it adds the HPD signal
pulse to the EDID probe path, but Archit has had a patch to
add HPD signal pulse to the EDID probe path before, so this
should address the cases where that helped. Another difference
is that regcache_mark_dirty() is also called in the power off
path once EDID is probed.
