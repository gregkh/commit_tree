gpio: gpio-mm: Add support for GPIO names

This patch sets the gpio_chip names option with an array of GPIO line
names that match the manual documentation for the Diamond Systems
GPIO-MM. This should make it easier for users to identify which GPIO
line corresponds to a respective GPIO pin on the device.
