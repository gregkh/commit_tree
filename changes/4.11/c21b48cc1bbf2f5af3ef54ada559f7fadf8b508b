net: adjust skb->truesize in ___pskb_trim()

Andrey found a way to trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len) in
skb_try_coalesce() using syzkaller and a filter attached to a TCP
socket.

As we did recently in commit 158f323b9868 ("net: adjust skb->truesize in
pskb_expand_head()") we can adjust skb->truesize from ___pskb_trim(),
via a call to skb_condense().

If all frags were freed, then skb->truesize can be recomputed.

This call can be done if skb is not yet owned, or destructor is
sock_edemux().
