[media] davinci: vpif_capture: fix start/stop streaming locking

Video capture subdevs may be over I2C and may sleep during xfer, so we
cannot do IRQ-disabled locking when calling the subdev.

The IRQ-disabled locking is meant to protect the DMA queue list
throughout the rest of the driver, so update the locking in
[start|stop]_streaming to protect just this list, and update the irqlock
comment to reflect what it actually protects.
