perf/core: Don't re-schedule CPU flexible events needlessly

In the sched-in path, we first remove a CPU's flexible events in order to
give priority to the task's pinned events. However, this step can be safely
skipped if the task doesn't have its own pinned events.

This patch implements this skipping.
