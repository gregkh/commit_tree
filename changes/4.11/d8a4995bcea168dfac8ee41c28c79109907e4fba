tty: pl011: Work around QDF2400 E44 stuck BUSY bit

The Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies QDF2400 family of SoCs contains a
custom (non-PrimeCell) implementation of the SBSA UART. Occasionally the
BUSY bit in the Flag Register gets stuck as 1, erratum 44 for both 2432v1
and 2400v1 SoCs.Checking that the Transmit FIFO Empty (TXFE) bit is 0,
instead of checking that the BUSY bit is 1, works around the issue.

To facilitate this substitution of flags and values, introduce
vendor-specific inversion of Feature Register bits when UART AMBA Port
(UAP) data is available. For the earlycon case, prior to UAP availability,
implement alternative putc and early_write functions.

Similar to what how ARMv8 ACPI PCI quirks are detected during MCFG parsing,
check the OEM fields of the Serial Port Console Redirection (SPCR) ACPI
table to determine if the current platform is known to be affected by the
erratum.
