staging: iio: isl29028: remove nested if statements

There are two callers to the function isl29028_set_als_ir_mode() and
both instances use a nested if statement to only change the chip state
if it is not in the proper mode. This patch moves this check into the
isl29028_set_als_ir_mode() function to remove the nested if
statements.
