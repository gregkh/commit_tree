bpf: simplify __is_valid_access test on cb

The __is_valid_access() test for cb[] from 62c7989b24db ("bpf: allow
b/h/w/dw access for bpf's cb in ctx") was done unnecessarily complex,
we can just simplify it the same way as recent fix from 2d071c643f1c
("bpf, trace: make ctx access checks more robust") did. Overflow can
never happen as size is 1/2/4/8 depending on access.
