drm/edid: Set AVI infoframe Q even when QS=0

HDMI 2.0 recommends that we set the Q bits in the AVI infoframe
even when the sink does not support quantization range selection (QS=0).
According to CEA-861 we can do that as long as the Q we send matches
the default quantization range for the mode.

Previously I think I had misread the spec as saying that you can't
send a non-zero Q at all when QS=0. But that's not what the spec
actually says.
