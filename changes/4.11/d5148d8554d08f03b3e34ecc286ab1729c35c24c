tools lib bpf: Add bpf_object__pin()

Add a new API to pin a BPF object to the filesystem. The user can
specify the path within a BPF filesystem to pin the object.
Programs will be pinned under a subdirectory named the same as the
program, with each instance appearing as a numbered file under that
directory, and maps will be pinned under the path using the name of
the map as the file basename.

For example, with the directory '/sys/fs/bpf/foo' and a BPF object which
contains two instances of a program named 'bar', and a map named 'baz':

/sys/fs/bpf/foo/bar/0
/sys/fs/bpf/foo/bar/1
/sys/fs/bpf/foo/baz
