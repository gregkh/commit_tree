audit: Make AUDIT_KERNEL event conform to the specification

The AUDIT_KERNEL event is not following name=value format. This causes
some information to get lost. The event has been reformatted to follow
the convention. Additionally the audit_enabled value was added for
troubleshooting purposes. The following is an example of the new event:

  type=KERNEL audit(1480621249.833:1): state=initialized
              audit_enabled=0 res=1
