drm/i915: Fix the overlay frontbuffer tracking

Do the overlay frontbuffer tracking properly so that it matches
the state of the overlay on/off/continue requests.

One slight problem is that intel_frontbuffer_flip_complete()
may get delayed by an arbitrarily liong time due to the fact that
the overlay code likes to bail out when a signal occurs. So the
flip may not get completed until the ioctl is restarted. But fixing
that would require bigger surgery, so I decided to ignore it for now.
