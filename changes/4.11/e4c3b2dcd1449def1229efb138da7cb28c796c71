Btrfs: kill trans in run_delalloc_nocow and btrfs_cross_ref_exist

run_delalloc_nocow has used trans in two places where they don't
actually need @trans.

For btrfs_lookup_file_extent, we search for file extents without COWing
anything, and for btrfs_cross_ref_exist, the only place where we need
@trans is deferencing it in order to get running_transaction which we
could easily get from the global fs_info.
