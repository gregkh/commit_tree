IB/mlx5: Use blue flame register allocator in mlx5_ib

Make use of the blue flame registers allocator at mlx5_ib. Since blue
flame was not really supported we remove all the code that is related to
blue flame and we let all consumers to use the same blue flame register.
Once blue flame is supported we will add the code. As part of this patch
we also move the definition of struct mlx5_bf to mlx5_ib.h as it is only
used by mlx5_ib.
