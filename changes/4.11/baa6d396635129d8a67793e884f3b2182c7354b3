fpga: Add scatterlist based programming

Requiring contiguous kernel memory is not a good idea, this is a limited
resource and allocation can fail under normal work loads.

This introduces a .write_sg op that supporting drivers can provide
to DMA directly from dis-contiguous memory and a new entry point
fpga_mgr_buf_load_sg that users can call to directly provide page
lists.

The full matrix of compatibility is provided, either the linear or sg
interface can be used by the user with a driver supporting either
interface.

A notable change for drivers is that the .write op can now be called
multiple times.
