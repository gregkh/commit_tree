arm64: dts: allwinner: Remove no longer used pinctrl/sun4i-a10.h header

All dts files for the sunxi platform have been switched to the generic
pinconf bindings. As a result, the sunxi specific pinctrl macros are
no longer used.

Remove the #include entry with the following command:

    sed -i -e '/pinctrl\/sun4i-a10.h/D' \
	arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/*.dts?
