arm64: dts: juno: add CoreSight support for Juno r1/r2 variants

The CoreSight support added for Juno is valid for only Juno r0.
The Juno r1 and r2 variants have additional components and alternative
connection routes between trace source and sinks.

This patch builds on top of the existing r0 support and extends it to
Juno r1/r2 variants.
