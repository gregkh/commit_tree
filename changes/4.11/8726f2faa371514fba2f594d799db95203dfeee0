drm/i915: Remove WaDisableLSQCROPERFforOCL KBL workaround.

The WaDisableLSQCROPERFforOCL workaround has the side effect of
disabling an L3SQ optimization that has huge performance implications
and is unlikely to be necessary for the correct functioning of usual
graphic workloads.  Userspace is free to re-enable the workaround on
demand, and is generally in a better position to determine whether the
workaround is necessary than the DRM is (e.g. only during the
execution of compute kernels that rely on both L3 fences and HDC R/W
requests).

The same workaround seems to apply to BDW (at least to production
stepping G1) and SKL as well (the internal workaround database claims
that it does for all steppings, while the BSpec workaround table only
mentions pre-production steppings), but the DRM doesn't do anything
beyond whitelisting the L3SQCREG4 register so userspace can enable it
when it sees fit.  Do the same on KBL platforms.

Improves performance of the GFXBench4 gl_manhattan31 benchmark by 60%,
and gl_4 (AKA car chase) by 14% on a KBL GT2 running Mesa master --
This is followed by a regression of 35% and 10% respectively for the
same benchmarks and platform caused by my recent patch series
switching userspace to use the dataport constant cache instead of the
sampler to implement uniform pull constant loads, which caused us to
hit more heavily the L3 cache (and on platforms other than KBL had the
opposite effect of improving performance of the same two benchmarks).
The overall effect on KBL of this change combined with the recent
userspace change is respectively 4.6% and 2.6%.  SynMark2 OglShMapPcf
was affected by the constant cache changes (though it improved as it
did on other platforms rather than regressing), but is not
significantly affected by this patch (with statistical significance of
5% and sample size 20).

v2: Drop some more code to avoid unused variable warning.
