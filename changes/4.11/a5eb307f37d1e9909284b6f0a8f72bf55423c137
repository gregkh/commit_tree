target: Stop execution if CMD_T_STOP has been set

Stop execution if CMD_T_STOP has been set for a command just after
the command has been added to the device command list and before
.write_pending() is called. The following sequence can trigger this:
- transport_handle_cdb_direct() gets called. This function namely
  sets CMD_T_ACTIVE before it calls transport_generic_new_cmd().
- __transport_wait_for_tasks() is called concurrently. This function
  sets CMD_T_STOP for all active commands that have not been aborted.
