usb: chipidea: msm: Make platform data driver local instead of global

If two devices are probed with this same driver, they'll share
the same platform data structure, while the chipidea core layer
writes and modifies it. This can lead to interesting results
especially if one device is an OTG type chipidea controller and
another is a host. Let's create a copy of this structure per each
device instance so that odd things don't happen.
