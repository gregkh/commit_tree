ARM: dts: Add gyro and accel to APQ8060 Dragonboard

This adds the MPU-3050 gyroscope and the KXSD9 accelerometer to
the Qualcomm APQ8060 Dragonboard. The KXSD9 is mounted beyond the
MPU-3050 and appear as a subdevice beyond it. We set up the
required GPIO and interrupt lines to make the devices work.
