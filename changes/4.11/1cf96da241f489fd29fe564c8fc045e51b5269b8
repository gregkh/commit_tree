staging: lustre: lmv: remove nlink check in lmv_revalidate_slaves

If an application attempts to remove millions of files in a
single directory it will fail. This failure was tracked down to
the nlink < 2 check in lmv_revalidate_slaves, because after
nlink reaches to maximum value of LDISKFS_LINK_MAX (65000),
the nlink broadcast back from the server will be reported as
one. The return value of 1 is not invalid so lets remove
the check.
