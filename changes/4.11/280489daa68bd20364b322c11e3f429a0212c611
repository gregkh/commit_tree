drm/msm: adreno: fix build error without debugfs

The newly added a5xx support fails to build when debugfs is diabled:

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a5xx_gpu.c:849:4: error: 'struct msm_gpu_funcs' has no member named 'show'
drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a5xx_gpu.c:849:11: error: 'a5xx_show' undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean 'a5xx_irq'?

This adds a missing #ifdef.
