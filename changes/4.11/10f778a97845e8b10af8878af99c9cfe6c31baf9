ARM: shmobile: apmu: Add debug resource reset for secondary CPU boot

In debug mode (MD21=1), reset requests derived from power-shutoff to the
AP-system CPU cores must be enabled before the AP-system CPU cores
resume from power-shutoff for the first time. Else resume may fail,
causing the system to hang during boot.

As setting these bits is a no-op in normal mode, there's no need to
check the actual state of MD21 first.
