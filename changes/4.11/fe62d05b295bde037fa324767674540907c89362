syncookies: use SipHash in place of SHA1

SHA1 is slower and less secure than SipHash, and so replacing syncookie
generation with SipHash makes natural sense. Some BSDs have been doing
this for several years in fact.

The speedup should be similar -- and even more impressive -- to the
speedup from the sequence number fix in this series.
