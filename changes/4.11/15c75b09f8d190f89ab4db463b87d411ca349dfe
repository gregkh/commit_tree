ALSA: ctxfi: Fallback DMA mask to 32bit

Currently ctxfi driver tries to set only the 64bit DMA mask on 64bit
architectures, and bails out if it fails.  This causes a problem on
some platforms since the 64bit DMA isn't always guaranteed.  We should
fall back to the default 32bit DMA when 64bit DMA fails.
