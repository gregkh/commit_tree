pwm: Make the PWM_POLARITY flag in DTB optional

Change the PWM chip driver registration so that a chip driver that
supports polarity inversion can still be used with DTBs that don't
provide the polarity flag as part of the specifier.

This is done to provide polarity inversion support for the pwm-imx
driver without having to modify all existing DTS files.
