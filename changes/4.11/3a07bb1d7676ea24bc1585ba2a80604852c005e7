blk-mq: fix potential oops with polling and blk-mq scheduler

If we have a scheduler attached, blk_mq_tag_to_rq() on the
scheduled tags will return NULL if a request is no longer
in flight. This is different than using the normal tags,
where it will always return the fixed request. Check for
this condition for polling, in case we happen to enter
polling for a completed request.

The request address remains valid, so this check and return
should be perfectly safe.
