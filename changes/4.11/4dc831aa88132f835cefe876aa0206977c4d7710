powerpc: Fix compiling a BE kernel with a powerpc64le toolchain

GCC can compile with either endian, but the default ABI version is set
based on the default endianness of the toolchain. Alan Modra says:

  you need both -mbig and -mabi=elfv1 to make a powerpc64le gcc
  generate powerpc64 code

The opposite is true for powerpc64 when generating -mlittle it
requires -mabi=elfv2 to generate v2 ABI, which we were already doing.

This change adds ABI annotations together with endianness for all cases,
LE and BE. This fixes the case of building a BE kernel with a toolchain
that is LE by default.
