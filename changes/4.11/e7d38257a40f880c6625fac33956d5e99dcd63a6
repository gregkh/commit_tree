scsi: ufs: fix multiple ufs spec violation

When a command to a W-LU is timed out via scsi, error handling
will treat it as any other LU and send commands such as
START_STOP with wrong format or task abort. Those commands are
illegal for W-LU according to the UFS spec.
To solve it, when an error is recognized those steps are skipped
and the last step, reset and restore process, is initiated.
