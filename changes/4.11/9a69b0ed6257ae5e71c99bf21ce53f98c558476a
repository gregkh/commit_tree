lightnvm: allow targets to use sysfs

In order to register through the sysfs interface, a driver needs to know
its kobject. On a disk structure, this happens when the partition
information is added (device_add_disk), which for lightnvm takes place
after the target has been initialized. This means that on target
initialization, the kboject has not been created yet.

This patch adds a target function to let targets initialize their own
kboject as a child of the disk kobject.
