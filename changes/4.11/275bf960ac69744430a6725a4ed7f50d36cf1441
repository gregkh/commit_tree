vhost: better detection of available buffers

This patch tries to do several tweaks on vhost_vq_avail_empty() for a
better performance:

- check cached avail index first which could avoid userspace memory access.
- using unlikely() for the failure of userspace access
- check vq->last_avail_idx instead of cached avail index as the last
  step.

This patch is need for batching supports which needs to peek whether
or not there's still available buffers in the ring.
