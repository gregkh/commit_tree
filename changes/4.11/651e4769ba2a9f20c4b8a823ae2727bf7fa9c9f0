drm/bridge: adv7511: Rework adv7511_power_on/off() so they can be reused internally

In chasing down issues with EDID probing, I found some
duplicated but incomplete logic used to power the chip on and
off.

This patch refactors the adv7511_power_on/off functions, so
they can be used for internal needs.
