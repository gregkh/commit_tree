xtables: extend matches and targets with .usersize

In matches and targets that define a kernel-only tail to their
xt_match and xt_target data structs, add a field .usersize that
specifies up to where data is to be shared with userspace.

Performed a search for comment "Used internally by the kernel" to find
relevant matches and targets. Manually inspected the structs to derive
a valid offsetof.
