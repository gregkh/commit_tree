drm/amd/amdgpu: lock reservation object while creating shadow bo

ttm_bo_init checks that the reservation object is locked. This is
the caller's responsibility when resv != NULL. Otherwise, the inline
reservation object of the newly allocated buffer is used and must
explicitly be locked.

Uninterruptible w/w locks without an acquire context are always
successful.

v2: use ww_mutex_lock
