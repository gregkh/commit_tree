powerpc/64: Enable use of radix MMU under hypervisor on POWER9

To use radix as a guest, we first need to tell the hypervisor via
the ibm,client-architecture call first that we support POWER9 and
architecture v3.00, and that we can do either radix or hash and
that we would like to choose later using an hcall (the
H_REGISTER_PROC_TBL hcall).

Then we need to check whether the hypervisor agreed to us using
radix.  We need to do this very early on in the kernel boot process
before any of the MMU initialization is done.  If the hypervisor
doesn't agree, we can't use radix and therefore clear the radix
MMU feature bit.

Later, when we have set up our process table, which points to the
radix tree for each process, we need to install that using the
H_REGISTER_PROC_TBL hcall.
