MIPS: kexec: remove SMP_DUMP

SMP_DUMP has been added as a new IPI signal when kexec support was added
for Cavium Octeon CPUs ('commit 7aa1c8f47e7e ("MIPS: kdump: Add support")'.
However, the new signal doesn't appear to ever have a proper handler
added (octeon_message_functions[] array has an empty handler for it),
and generic IPI handlers now trigger a BUG() on unhandled signal.

As the method is unused remove it completely and replace its only
invocation with a smp_call_function().
