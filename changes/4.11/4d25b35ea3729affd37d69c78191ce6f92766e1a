sched/fair: Restore previous rq_flags when migrating tasks in hotplug

__migrate_task() can return with a different runqueue locked than the
one we passed as an argument. So that we can repin the lock in
migrate_tasks() (and keep the update_rq_clock() bit) we need to
restore the old rq_flags before repinning.

Note that it wouldn't be correct to change move_queued_task() to repin
because of the change of runqueue and the fact that having an
up-to-date clock on the initial rq doesn't mean the new rq has one
too.
