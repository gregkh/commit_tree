ALSA: x86: Allow single period PCM operation

This is an implementation of PCM streaming with only 1 period.
Since the hardware requires the refresh of BDs after each BD
processing finishes, we'd need at least two BDs.  The trick is that
both BDs point to the same content: the address of the PCM buffer
head, and the whole buffer size.  Then it loops over to the whole
buffer again after it finished once.
