Input: elan_i2c - add ASUS EeeBook X205TA special touchpad fw

EeeBook X205TA is yet another ASUS device with a special touchpad
firmware that needs to be accounted for during initialization, or
else the touchpad will go into an invalid state upon suspend/resume.
Adding the appropriate ic_type and product_id check fixes the problem.
