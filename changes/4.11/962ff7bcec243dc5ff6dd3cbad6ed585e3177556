mei: replace callback structures used as list head by list_head

mei_dev structure used struct mei_cl_cb type variables as for holding
callbacks list heads.  Replace them by the actual struct list_head
as there is no other info that is handled. This slims down
the mei_dev structure and mostly streamline the code.
