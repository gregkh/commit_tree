drm: Simplify drm_mm scan-list manipulation

Since we mandate a strict reverse-order of drm_mm_scan_remove_block()
after drm_mm_scan_add_block() we can further simplify the list
manipulations when generating the temporary scan-hole.

v2: Highlight the games being played with the lists to track the scan
holes without allocation.
