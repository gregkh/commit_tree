serial: 8250_pci: Add MKS Tenta SCOM-0800 and SCOM-0801 cards

The MKS Instruments SCOM-0800 and SCOM-0801 cards (originally by Tenta
Technologies) are 3U CompactPCI serial cards with 4 and 8 serial ports,
respectively.  The first 4 ports are implemented by an OX16PCI954 chip,
and the second 4 ports are implemented by an OX16C954 chip on a local
bus, bridged by the second PCI function of the OX16PCI954.  The ports
are jumper-selectable as RS-232 and RS-422/485, and the UARTs use a
non-standard oscillator frequency of 20 MHz (base_baud = 1250000).
