s390/sclp: make early sclp code readable

This patch

 - unifies the old sclp early code and the sclp early printk code, so
   they can use common functions

 - makes sure all sclp early functions and variables have the same
   "sclp_early" prefix

 - converts the sclp early printk code into readable code by using
   existing data structures instead of hard coded magic arrays

 - splits the early sclp code into two files: sclp_early.c and
   sclp_early_core.c. The core file contains everything that is
   required by the kernel decompressor and may not call functions not
   contained within the core file. Otherwise the result would be a
   link error.

 - changes interrupt handling to be completely synchronous. The old
   early sclp code had a small window which allowed to receive several
   interrupts instead of exactly the single expected interrupt. This
   did hide a subtle potential bug, which is fixed with this large
   rework.

 - contains a couple of small cleanups.
