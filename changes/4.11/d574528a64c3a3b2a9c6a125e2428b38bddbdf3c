drm/kms-core: Use recommened kerneldoc for struct member refs

I just learned that &struct_name.member_name works and looks pretty
even. It doesn't (yet) link to the member directly though, which would
be really good for big structures or vfunc tables (where the
per-member kerneldoc tends to be long).

Also some minor drive-by polish where it makes sense, I read a lot
of docs ...
