tcp: fix potential double free issue for fastopen_req

tp->fastopen_req could potentially be double freed if a malicious
user does the following:
1. Enable TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT sockopt and do a connect() on the socket.
2. Call connect() with AF_UNSPEC to disconnect the socket.
3. Make this socket a listening socket by calling listen().
4. Accept incoming connections and generate child sockets. All child
   sockets will get a copy of the pointer of fastopen_req.
5. Call close() on all sockets. fastopen_req will get freed multiple
   times.
