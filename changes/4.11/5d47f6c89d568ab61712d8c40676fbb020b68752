net/mlx5: Don't save PCI state when PCI error is detected

When a PCI error is detected the PCI state could be corrupt, don't save
it in that flow. Save the state after initialization. After restoring the
PCI state during slot reset save it again, restoring the state destroys
the previously saved state info.
