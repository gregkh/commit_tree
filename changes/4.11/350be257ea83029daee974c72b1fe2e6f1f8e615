CIFS: Fix null pointer deref during read resp processing

Currently during receiving a read response mid->resp_buf can be
NULL when it is being passed to cifs_discard_remaining_data() from
cifs_readv_discard(). Fix it by always passing server->smallbuf
instead and initializing mid->resp_buf at the end of read response
processing.
