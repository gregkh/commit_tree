batman-adv: Initialize gw sel_class via batadv_algo

The gateway selection class variable is shared between different algorithm
versions. But the interpretation of the content is algorithm specific. The
initialization is therefore also algorithm specific.

But this was implemented incorrectly and the initialization for BATMAN_V
always overwrote the value previously written for BATMAN_IV. This could
only be avoided when BATMAN_V was disabled during compile time.

Using a special batadv_algo hook for this initialization avoids this
problem.
