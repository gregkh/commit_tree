s390/uaccess: get_user() should zero on failure (again)

Commit fd2d2b191fe7 ("s390: get_user() should zero on failure")
intended to fix s390's get_user() implementation which did not zero
the target operand if the read from user space faulted. Unfortunately
the patch has no effect: the corresponding inline assembly specifies
that the operand is only written to ("=") and the previous value is
discarded.

Therefore the compiler is free to and actually does omit the zero
initialization.

To fix this simply change the contraint modifier to "+", so the
compiler cannot omit the initialization anymore.
