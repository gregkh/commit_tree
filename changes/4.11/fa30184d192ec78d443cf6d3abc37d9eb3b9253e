PM / OPP: Return opp_table from dev_pm_opp_set_*() routines

Now that we have proper kernel reference infrastructure in place for OPP
tables, use it to guarantee that the OPP table isn't freed while being
used by the callers of dev_pm_opp_set_*() APIs.

Make them all return the pointer to the OPP table after taking its
reference and put the reference back with dev_pm_opp_put_*() APIs.

Now that the OPP table wouldn't get freed while these routines are
executing after dev_pm_opp_get_opp_table() is called, there is no need
to take opp_table_lock. Drop them as well.

Remove the rcu specific comments from these routines as they aren't
relevant anymore.

Note that prototypes of dev_pm_opp_{set|put}_regulators() were already
updated by another patch.
