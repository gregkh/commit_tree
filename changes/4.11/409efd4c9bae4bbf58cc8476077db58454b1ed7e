memblock: also dump physmem list within __memblock_dump_all

Since commit 70210ed950b5 ("mm/memblock: add physical memory list") the
memblock structure knows about a physical memory list.

The physical memory list should also be dumped if memblock_dump_all() is
called in case memblock_debug is switched on.  This makes debugging a
bit easier.
