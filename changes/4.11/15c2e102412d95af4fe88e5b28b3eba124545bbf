ARM: orion: remove unused wnr854t_switch_plat_data

The other instances of this structure got removed along with the MDIO

as well:

arch/arm/mach-orion5x/wnr854t-setup.c:109:44: error: 'wnr854t_switch_plat_data' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-variable]
 static struct dsa_platform_data __initdata wnr854t_switch_plat_data = {
