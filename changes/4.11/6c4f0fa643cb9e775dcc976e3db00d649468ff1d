cpufreq: schedutil: move cached_raw_freq to struct sugov_policy

cached_raw_freq applies to the entire cpufreq policy and not individual
CPUs. Apart from wasting per-cpu memory, it is actually wrong to keep it
in struct sugov_cpu as we may end up comparing next_freq with a stale
cached_raw_freq of a random CPU.

Move cached_raw_freq to struct sugov_policy.
