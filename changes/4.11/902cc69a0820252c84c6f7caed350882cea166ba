mtd: spi-nor: rename SPINOR_OP_* macros of the 4-byte address op codes

This patch renames the SPINOR_OP_* macros of the 4-byte address
instruction set so the new names all share a common pattern: the 4-byte
address name is built from the 3-byte address name appending the "_4B"
suffix.

The patch also introduces new op codes to support other SPI protocols such
as SPI 1-4-4 and SPI 1-2-2.

This is a transitional patch and will help a later patch of spi-nor.c
to automate the translation from the 3-byte address op codes into their
4-byte address version.
