ARM: dts: exynos: Increase MFC left reserved memory region size

The sizes of the MFC reserved memory regions for CMA are 16 MiB for the
left bank and 8 MiB for the right bank. But this isn't enough to decode
high resolution videos so increase the size for the left bank to 36 MiB
which is enough for 1080p (1920x1080).
