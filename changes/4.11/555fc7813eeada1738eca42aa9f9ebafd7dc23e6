ftrace: Replace (void *)1 with a meaningful macro name FTRACE_GRAPH_EMPTY

When the set_graph_function or set_graph_notrace contains no records, a
banner is displayed of either "#### all functions enabled ####" or
"#### all functions disabled ####" respectively. To tell the seq operations
to do this, (void *)1 is passed as a return value. Instead of using a
hardcoded meaningless variable, define it as a macro.
