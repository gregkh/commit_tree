thermal: use cpumask_var_t for on-stack cpu masks

Putting a bare cpumask structure on the stack produces a warning on
large SMP configurations:

drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c: In function 'cpufreq_state2power':
drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c:644:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c: In function '__cpufreq_cooling_register':
drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c:898:1: warning: the frame size of 1104 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

The recommended workaround is to use cpumask_var_t, which behaves just like
a normal cpu mask in most cases, but turns into a dynamic allocation
when CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is set.
