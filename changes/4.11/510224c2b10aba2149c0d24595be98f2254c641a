arm64: head.S: fix up stale comments

In commit 23c8a500c24d02dd ("arm64: kernel: use ordinary return/argument
register for el2_setup()"), we stopped using w20 as a global stash of
the boot mode flag, and instead pass this around in w0 as a function
parameter.

Unfortunately, we missed a couple of comments, which still refer to the
old convention of using w20/x20.

This patch fixes up the comments to describe the code as it currently
works.
