l2tp: fix race in l2tp_recv_common()

Taking a reference on sessions in l2tp_recv_common() is racy; this
has to be done by the callers.

To this end, a new function is required (l2tp_session_get()) to
atomically lookup a session and take a reference on it. Callers then
have to manually drop this reference.
