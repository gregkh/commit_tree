qla2xxx: Improve RSCN handling in driver

Current code blindly does State Change Registration when
the link is up. Move SCR behind fabric scan, so that arbitrated
loop scan would not get erroneous error message.

Some of the other improvements are as follows

- Add session deletion for TPRLO and send acknowledgment for TPRLO.
- Enable FW option to move ABTS, RIDA & PUREX from RSPQ to ATIOQ.
- Save NPort ID early in link init.
- Move ABTS & RIDA to ATIOQ helps in keeping command ordering and
  link up sequence ordering.
- Save Nport ID and update VP map so that SCSI CMD/ATIO won't be dropped.
- fcport alloc does the initializes memory to zero. Remove memset to
  zero since It might corrupt link list.
- Turn off Registration for State Change MB in loop mode.
