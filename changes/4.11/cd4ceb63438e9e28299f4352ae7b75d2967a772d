perf util: Save pid-cmdline mapping into tracing header

Current trace info data lacks the saved cmdline mapping which is needed
for pevent to find out the comm of a task.  Add this and bump up the
version number so that perf can determine its presence when reading.

This is mostly corresponding to trace.dat file version 6, but still
lacks 4 byte of number of cpus, and 10 bytes of type string - and I
think we don't need those anyway.
