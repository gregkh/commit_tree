sched/headers: Prepare to remove spurious <linux/sched.h> inclusion dependencies

In the following patches we are going to remove various headers
from sched.h and other headers that sched.h includes.

To make those patches build cleanly prepare the scene by adding
dependencies to various files that learned to rely on those
to-be-removed dependencies.

These changes all make sense standalone: they add a header for
a data type that a particular .c or .h file is using.
