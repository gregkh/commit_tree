remoteproc: qcom: mdt_loader: Use signed type for offset

In the transition from using rproc_da_to_va(), the type of the load
offset became unsigned. This causes the subsequent check to let negative
values less than p_memsz + mem_size through and we write outside of the
buffer.

Change the type back to a signed value to catch this.
