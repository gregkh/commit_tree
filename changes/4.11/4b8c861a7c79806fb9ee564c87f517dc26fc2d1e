block: Move bdev_unhash_inode() after invalidate_partition()

Move bdev_unhash_inode() after invalidate_partition() as
invalidate_partition() looks up bdev and it cannot find the right bdev
inode after bdev_unhash_inode() is called. Thus invalidate_partition()
would not invalidate page cache of the previously used bdev. Also use
part_devt() when calling bdev_unhash_inode() instead of manually
creating the device number.
