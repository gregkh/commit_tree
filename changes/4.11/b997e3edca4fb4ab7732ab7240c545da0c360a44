pwm: lpss: Set enable-bit before waiting for update-bit to go low

At least on cherrytrail, the update bit will never go low when the
enabled bit is not set.

This causes the backlight on my cube iwork8 air tablet to never turn on
again after being turned off because in the pwm_lpss_apply enable path
pwm_lpss_update will fail causing an error exit and the enable-bit to
never get set. Any following pwm_lpss_apply calls will fail the
pwm_lpss_is_updating check.

Since the docs say that the update bit should be set before the
enable-bit, split pwm_lpss_update into setting the update-bit and
pwm_lpss_wait_for_update, and move the pwm_lpss_wait_for_update call
in the enable path to after setting the enable-bit.
