inet: don't check for bind conflicts twice when searching for a port

This is just wasted time, we've already found a tb that doesn't have a bind
conflict, and we don't drop the head lock so scanning again isn't going to give
us a different answer.  Instead move the tb->reuse setting logic outside of the
found_tb path and put it in the success: path.  Then make it so that we don't
goto again if we find a bind conflict in the found_tb path as we won't reach
this anymore when we are scanning for an ephemeral port.
