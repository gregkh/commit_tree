staging: rtl: fix possible NULL pointer dereference

gcc-7 detects that wlanhdr_to_ethhdr() in two drivers calls memcpy() with
a destination argument that an earlier function call may have set to NULL:

staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c: In function 'wlanhdr_to_ethhdr':
staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_recv.c:1318:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_recv.c: In function 'r8712_wlanhdr_to_ethhdr':
staging/rtl8712/rtl871x_recv.c:649:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]

I'm fixing this by adding a NULL pointer check and returning failure
from the function, which is hopefully already handled properly.

This seems to date back to when the drivers were originally added,
so backporting the fix to stable seems appropriate. There are other
related realtek drivers in the kernel, but none of them contain a
function with a similar name or produce this warning.
