drm: mxsfb: fix pixel clock polarity

The DRM subsystem specifies the pixel clock polarity from a
controllers perspective: DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_NEGEDGE means
the controller drives the data on pixel clocks falling edge.
That is the controllers DOTCLK_POL=0 (Default is data launched
at negative edge).

Also change the data enable logic to be high active by default
and only change if explicitly requested via bus_flags. With
that defaults are:
- Data enable: high active
- Pixel clock polarity: controller drives data on negative edge
