PM / OPP: Don't allocate OPP table from _opp_allocate()

There is no point in trying to find/allocate the table for every OPP
that is added for a device. It would be far more efficient to allocate
the table only once and pass its pointer to the routines that add the
OPP entry.

Locking is removed from _opp_add_static_v2() and _opp_add_v1() now as
the callers call them with that lock already held.

Call to _remove_opp_table() routine is also removed from _opp_free()
now, as opp_table isn't allocated from within _opp_allocate(). This is
handled by the routines which created the OPP table in the first place.
