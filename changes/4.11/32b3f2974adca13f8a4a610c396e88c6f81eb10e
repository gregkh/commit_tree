mm, vmscan: show LRU name in mm_vmscan_lru_isolate tracepoint

mm_vmscan_lru_isolate currently prints only whether the LRU we isolate
from is file or anonymous but we do not know which LRU this is.

It is useful to know whether the list is active or inactive, since we
are using the same function to isolate pages from both of them and it's
hard to distinguish otherwise.
