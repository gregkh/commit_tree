ARM: dts: imx6sx-udoo-neo: Fix reboot hang

After issuing a 'reboot' command the imx6sx-udoo-neo board does not
reboot as expected and it just hangs instead.

In mainline kernel only LDO enabled mode is supported. Do not provide
arm-supply/soc-supply nodes in the device tree, so that the board operates
in LDO enabled mode and can then successfully reboot via watchdog.
