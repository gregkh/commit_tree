drm/msm/dsi: Add 8x96 info in dsi_cfg

Add 8x96 DSI data in dsi_cfg. The downstream kernel's dsi_host driver
enables core_mmss_clk. We're seeing some branch clock warnings on
8x96 when enabling this. There doesn't seem to be any negative effect
with not enabling this clock, so use it once we figure out why we
get the warnings.
