arm64: KVM: Survive unknown traps from guests

Currently we BUG() if we see an ESR_EL2.EC value we don't recognise. As
configurable disables/enables are added to the architecture (controlled
by RES1/RES0 bits respectively), with associated synchronous exceptions,
it may be possible for a guest to trigger exceptions with classes that
we don't recognise.

While we can't service these exceptions in a manner useful to the guest,
we can avoid bringing down the host. Per ARM DDI 0487A.k_iss10775, page
D7-1937, EC values within the range 0x00 - 0x2c are reserved for future
use with synchronous exceptions, and EC values within the range 0x2d -
0x3f may be used for either synchronous or asynchronous exceptions.

The patch makes KVM handle any unknown EC by injecting an UNDEFINED
exception into the guest, with a corresponding (ratelimited) warning in
the host dmesg. We could later improve on this with with a new (opt-in)
exit to the host userspace.
