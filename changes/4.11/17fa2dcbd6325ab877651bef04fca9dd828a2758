iio: adc: handle unknow of_device_id data

If we get an unknown 'childmode' value, a number of variables are not
initialized properly:

drivers/iio/adc/rcar-gyroadc.c: In function 'rcar_gyroadc_probe':
drivers/iio/adc/rcar-gyroadc.c:390:5: error: 'num_channels' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/iio/adc/rcar-gyroadc.c:426:22: error: 'sample_width' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/iio/adc/rcar-gyroadc.c:428:23: error: 'channels' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The driver is currently correct, but handling this properly is more robust
for possible modifications.

There is also a false-positive warning about adcmode being possibly uninitialized,
but that cannot happen as we also check the 'first' flag:

drivers/iio/adc/rcar-gyroadc.c:398:26: error: 'adcmode' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This adds an initialization for 'adcmode' and bails out for any unknown childmode.
