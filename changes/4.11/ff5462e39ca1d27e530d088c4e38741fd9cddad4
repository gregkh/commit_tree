ext4: fix DAX write locking

Unlike O_DIRECT DAX is not an optional opt-in feature selected by the
application, so we'll have to provide the traditional synchron—ñzation
of overlapping writes as we do for buffered writes.

This was broken historically for DAX, but got fixed for ext2 and XFS
as part of the iomap conversion.  Fix up ext4 as well.
