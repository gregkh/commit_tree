staging: comedi: ni_pcimio: Support more PXI cards

Add support for NI PXI-6220, PXI-6221, PXI-6229, PXI-6250, PXI-6254,
PXI-6259, PXIe-6259, PXI-6280, PXI-6284, and PXI-6289 boards, treating
them the same as the correspondingly numbered PCI and PCIe boards (apart
from having different Comedi board name strings).  The same has
previously been done for other PXI boards supported by the driver.

The PCI device IDs for the newly supported boards come from the
"nixswv.inf" file in National Instrument's Windows drivers.

Also, sort `ni_pcimio_pci_table[]` by PCI device ID.  It is mostly
sorted already, so only the entries for PXI-6251 and PXIe-6251 need
moving.
