mmc: mmc_test: Use kcalloc() in mmc_test_alloc_mem()

* The script "checkpatch.pl" pointed information out like the following.

  WARNING: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply

  Thus fix the affected source code place.

* Replace the specification of a data structure by a pointer dereference
  to make the corresponding size determination a bit safer according to
  the Linux coding style convention.
