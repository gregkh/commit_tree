pinctrl: Allow configuration of pins from gpiolib based drivers

When a GPIO driver is backed by a pinctrl driver the GPIO driver
sometimes needs to call the pinctrl driver to configure certain things,
like whether the pin is used as input or output. In addition to this
there are other configurations applicable to GPIOs such as setting
debounce time of the GPIO.

To support this we introduce a new function pinctrl_gpio_set_config()
that can be used by gpiolib based driver to pass configuration requests
to the backing pinctrl driver.
