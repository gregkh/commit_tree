virtio_blk: make SCSI passthrough support configurable

The SCSI passthrough idea was a a bad idea to start with (guess who came
up with it?), and has been removed from the virtio 1.O spec, and is not
enabled by defauly by any host I know of.  Add a separate config option
for it so that we don't need to enable it for most setups.  That way
any bugs related to it (like the one recently fixed for vmapped stacks)
do not affect other users, and the size of the virtblk_req structure
also shrinks significantly.
