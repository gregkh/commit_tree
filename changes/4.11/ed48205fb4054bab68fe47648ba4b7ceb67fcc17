clk: sunxi-ng: mux: Fix determine_rate for mux clocks with pre-dividers

The determine_rate helper used ccu_mux_helper_adjust_parent_for_prediv()
to adjust the parent_rate to account for pre-dividers, but then passed
the pristine parent clock rate from clk_hw_get_rate() to the round()
callback, thereby ignoring the pre-divider adjustment. In addition,
it was saving the adjusted parent rate back into struct
clk_rate_request.

This patch fixes this by saving the pristine parent clock rate, and
adding a copy that is adjusted and passed to the round() callback.
The pristine copy, if it is the best solution, would be saved back
to struct clk_rate_request.
