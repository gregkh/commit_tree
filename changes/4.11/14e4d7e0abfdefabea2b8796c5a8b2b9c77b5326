tools lib traceevent: Initialize lenght on OLD_RING_BUFFER_TYPE_TIME_STAMP

A undefined value was being used for the OLD_RING_BUFFER_TYPE_TIME_STAMP
case entry, as the 'length' variable was not being initialized, fix it.

Caught by the reporter when building tools/perf/ using clang, which emmitted
this warning:

  kbuffer-parse.c:312:7: warning: variable 'length' is used uninitialized whenever switch case is taken [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
          case OLD_RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_EXTEND:
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  kbuffer-parse.c:339:29: note: uninitialized use occurs here
          kbuf->next = kbuf->index + length;
                                   ^~~~~~
  kbuffer-parse.c:297:21: note: initialize the variable 'length' to silence this warning
          unsigned int length;
                             ^
                              = 0
