net: phy: handle state correctly in phy_stop_machine

If the PHY is halted on stop, then do not set the state to PHY_UP.  This
ensures the phy will be restarted later in phy_start when the machine is
started again.

Fixes: 00db8189d984 ("This patch adds a PHY Abstraction Layer to the Linux Kernel, enabling ethernet drivers to remain as ignorant as is reasonable of the connected PHY's design and operation details.")
