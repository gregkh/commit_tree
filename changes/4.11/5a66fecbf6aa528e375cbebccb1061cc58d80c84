Drivers: hv: util: kvp: Fix a rescind processing issue

KVP may use a char device to support the communication between
the user level daemon and the driver. When the KVP channel is rescinded
we need to make sure that the char device is fully cleaned up before
we can process a new KVP offer from the host. Implement this logic.
