usb: dwc2: Add a quirk to allow speed negotiation for Hisilicon Hi6220

The Hi6220's usb controller is limited in that it does not
support "Split Transactions", so it does not support communicating
with low-speed and full-speed devices behind a high-speed hub.

Thus it requires a quirk so that we can manually drop the usb
speed when low/full-speed are attached, and bump back to high
speed when they are removed.
