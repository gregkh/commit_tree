serial: 8250_fintek: Add resource check for Fintek F81504/508/512

Add resource type check for Fintek F81504/508/512, BAR3/4/5 must be
IORESOURCE_IO.

Fintek is trying to make F81504/508/512 works on MMIO interface, but
it's still in progress. We found some issue when the experiment IC
when the BAR3/4/5 is IORESOURCE_MEM. It'll cause wrong operation with
IO resource. So we'll add the resource check for this.
