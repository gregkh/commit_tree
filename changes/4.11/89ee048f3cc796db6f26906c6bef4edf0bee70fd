sched/core: Fix group_entity's share update

The update of the share of a cfs_rq is done when its load_avg is updated
but before the group_entity's load_avg has been updated for the past time
slot. This generates wrong load_avg accounting which can be significant
when small tasks are involved in the scheduling.

Let take the example of a task a that is dequeued of its task group A:
   root
  (cfs_rq)
    \
    (se)
     A
    (cfs_rq)
      \
      (se)
       a

Task "a" was the only task in task group A which becomes idle when a is
dequeued.

We have the sequence:

- dequeue_entity a->se
    - update_load_avg(a->se)
    - dequeue_entity_load_avg(A->cfs_rq, a->se)
    - update_cfs_shares(A->cfs_rq)
	A->cfs_rq->load.weight == 0
        A->se->load.weight is updated with the new share (0 in this case)
- dequeue_entity A->se
    - update_load_avg(A->se) but its weight is now null so the last time
      slot (up to a tick) will be accounted with a weight of 0 instead of
      its real weight during the time slot. The last time slot will be
      accounted as an idle one whereas it was a running one.

If the running time of task a is short enough that no tick happens when it
runs, all running time of group entity A->se will be accounted as idle
time.

Instead, we should update the share of a cfs_rq (in fact the weight of its
group entity) only after having updated the load_avg of the group_entity.

update_cfs_shares() now takes the sched_entity as a parameter instead of the
cfs_rq, and the weight of the group_entity is updated only once its load_avg
has been synced with current time.
