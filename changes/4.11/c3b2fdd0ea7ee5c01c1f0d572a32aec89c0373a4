iio: adc: hx711: Add IIO driver for AVIA HX711

This is the IIO driver for AVIA HX711 ADC which is mostly used in weighting
cells.

The protocol is quite simple and using GPIOs:
One GPIO is used as clock (SCK) while another GPIO is read (DOUT)

The raw value read from the chip is delivered.
To get a weight one needs to subtract the zero offset and scale it.
