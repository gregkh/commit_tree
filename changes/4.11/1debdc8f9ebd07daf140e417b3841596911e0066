sh_eth: unmap DMA buffers when freeing rings

The DMA API debugging (when enabled) causes:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1445 at lib/dma-debug.c:519 add_dma_entry+0xe0/0x12c
DMA-API: exceeded 7 overlapping mappings of cacheline 0x01b2974d

to be  printed after repeated initialization of the Ether device, e.g.
suspend/resume or 'ifconfig' up/down. This is because DMA buffers mapped
using dma_map_single() in sh_eth_ring_format() and sh_eth_start_xmit() are
never unmapped. Resolve this problem by unmapping the buffers when freeing
the descriptor  rings;  in order  to do it right, we'd have to add an extra
parameter to sh_eth_txfree() (we rename this function to sh_eth_tx_free(),
while at it).

Based on the commit a47b70ea86bd ("ravb: unmap descriptors when freeing
rings").
