net/mlx5e: Update MPWQE stride size when modifying CQE compress state

When the admin enables/disables cqe compression, updating
mpwqe stride size is required:
    CQE compress ON  ==> stride size = 256B
    CQE compress OFF ==> stride size = 64B

This is already done on driver load via mlx5e_set_rq_type_params, all we
need is just to call it on arbitrary admin changes of cqe compression
state via priv flags or when changing timestamping state
(as it is mutually exclusive with cqe compression).

This bug introduces no functional damage, it only makes cqe compression
occur less often, since in ConnectX4-LX CQE compression is performed
only on packets smaller than stride size.

Tested:
 ethtool --set-priv-flags ethxx rx_cqe_compress on
 pktgen with  64 < pkt size < 256 and netperf TCP_STREAM (IPv4/IPv6)
 verify `ethtool -S ethxx | grep compress` are advancing more often
 (rapidly)
