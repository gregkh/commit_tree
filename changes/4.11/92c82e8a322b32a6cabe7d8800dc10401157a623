audit: add feature audit_lost reset

Add a method to reset the audit_lost value.

An AUDIT_SET message with the AUDIT_STATUS_LOST flag set by itself
will return a positive value repesenting the current audit_lost value
and reset the counter to zero.  If AUDIT_STATUS_LOST is not the
only flag set, the reset command will be ignored.  The value sent with
the command is ignored.  The return value will be the +ve lost value at
reset time.

An AUDIT_CONFIG_CHANGE message will be queued to the listening audit
daemon.  The message will be a standard CONFIG_CHANGE message with the
fields "lost=0" and "old=" with the latter containing the value of
audit_lost at reset time.
