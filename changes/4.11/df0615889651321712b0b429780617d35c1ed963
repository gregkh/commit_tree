mmc: block: stop passing around pointless return values

The mmc_blk_issue_rq() function is called in exactly one place
in queue.c and there the return value is ignored. So the
functions called from that function that also meticulously
return 0/1 do so for no good reason.

Error reporting on the asynchronous requests are done upward to
the block layer when the requests are eventually completed or
fail, which may happen during the flow of the mmc_blk_issue_*
functions directly (for "special commands") or later, when an
asynchronous read/write request is completed.

The issuing functions do not give rise to errors on their own,
and there is nothing to return back to the caller in queue.c.
Drop all return values and make the function return void.
