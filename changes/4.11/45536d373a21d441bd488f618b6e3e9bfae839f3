Input: joydev - do not report stale values on first open

Postpone axis initialization to the first open instead of doing it
in joydev_connect. This is to make sure the generated startup events
are representative of the current joystick state rather than what
it was when joydev_connect() was called, potentially much earlier.
Once the first user is connected to joydev node we'll be updating
joydev->abs[] values and subsequent clients will be getting correct
initial states as well.

This solves issues with joystick driven menus that start scrolling
up each time they are started, until the user moves the joystick to
generate events. In emulator menu setups where the menu program is
restarted every time the game exits, the repeated need to move the
joystick to stop the unintended scrolling gets old rather quickly...
