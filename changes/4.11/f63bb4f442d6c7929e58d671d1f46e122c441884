Input: bma150 - switch to using usleep_range instead of msleep

msleep (1~20) may not do what the caller intends, and will often sleep
longer.  (~20 ms actual sleep for any value given in the 1~20ms range) This
is not the desired behaviour for many cases like device resume time, device
suspend time, device enable time, etc.  Thus, change msleep to usleep_range
for precise wakeups.
