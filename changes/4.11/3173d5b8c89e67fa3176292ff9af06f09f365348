netfilter: ctnetlink: make it safer when checking the ct helper name

One CPU is doing ctnetlink_change_helper(), while another CPU is doing
unhelp() at the same time. So even if help->helper is not NULL at first,
the later statement strcmp(help->helper->name, ...) may still access
the NULL pointer.

So we must use rcu_read_lock and rcu_dereference to avoid such _bad_
thing happen.
