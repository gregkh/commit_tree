scsi: megaraid_sas: raid 1 fast path code optimize

No functional change. Code refactor.

Remove function megasas_fpio_to_ldio as we never require to convert fpio
to ldio because of frame unavailability.  Grab extra frame of raid 1
write fast path before it creates first frame as Fast Path.  Removed
is_raid_1_fp_write flag as raid 1 write fast path command is decided
using r1_alt_dev_handle only.  Move resetting megasas_cmd_fusion fields
at common function megasas_return_cmd_fusion.
