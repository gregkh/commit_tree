usb: dwc3: gadget: make Set Endpoint Configuration macros safe

Some gadget drivers are bad, bad boys. We notice
that ADB was passing bad Burst Size which caused top
bits of param0 to be overwritten which confused DWC3
when running this command.

In order to avoid future issues, we're going to make
sure values passed by macros are always safe for the
controller. Note that ADB still needs a fix to *not*
pass bad values.
