igb: Workaround for igb i210 firmware issue

Sometimes firmware may not properly initialize I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT causing
the probe of an igb i210 NIC to fail. This patch adds an addition zeroing
of this register during igb_get_phy_id to workaround this issue.

Thanks for Jochen Henneberg for the idea and original patch.
