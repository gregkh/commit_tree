IB/srp: Drain the send queue before destroying a QP

A quote from the IB spec:

However, if the Consumer does not wait for the Affiliated Asynchronous
Last WQE Reached Event, then WQE and Data Segment leakage may occur.
Therefore, it is good programming practice to tear down a QP that is
associated with an SRQ by using the following process:
* Put the QP in the Error State;
* wait for the Affiliated Asynchronous Last WQE Reached Event;
* either:
  * drain the CQ by invoking the Poll CQ verb and either wait for CQ
    to be empty or the number of Poll CQ operations has exceeded CQ
    capacity size; or
  * post another WR that completes on the same CQ and wait for this WR to return as a WC;
* and then invoke a Destroy QP or Reset QP.
