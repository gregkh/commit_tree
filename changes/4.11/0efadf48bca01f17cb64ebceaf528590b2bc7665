mm/hotplug: enable memory hotplug for non-lru movable pages

We had considered all of the non-lru pages as unmovable before commit
bda807d44454 ("mm: migrate: support non-lru movable page migration").
But now some of non-lru pages like zsmalloc, virtio-balloon pages also
become movable.  So we can offline such blocks by using non-lru page
migration.

This patch straightforwardly adds non-lru migration code, which means
adding non-lru related code to the functions which scan over pfn and
collect pages to be migrated and isolate them before migration.
