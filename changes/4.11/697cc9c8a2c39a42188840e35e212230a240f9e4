drm: Simplify GETRESOURCES ioctl

Looping twice when we can do it once is silly. Also use a consistent
style. Note that there's a good race with the connector list walking,
since that is no longer protected by mode_config.mutex. But that's for
a later patch to fix.

v2: Actually try to not blow up, somehow I lost the hunk that checks
we don't copy too much. Noticed by Chris.

v3:
- squash all drm_mode_getresources cleanups into one
- use consistent style for walking objects (Chris)

v4:
- Use u64_to_user_ptr (Chris)
- Don't forget to copy the last connector (Chris)

v5: Chris was right ...
