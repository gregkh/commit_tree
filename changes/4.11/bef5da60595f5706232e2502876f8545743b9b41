tracing/probes: Fix a warning message to show correct maximum length

Since tracing/*probe_events will accept a probe definition
up to 4096 - 2 ('\n' and '\0') bytes, it must show 4094 instead
of 4096 in warning message.

Note that there is one possible case of exceed 4094. If user
prepare 4096 bytes null-terminated string and syscall write
it with the count == 4095, then it can be accepted. However,
if user puts a '\n' after that, it must rejected.
So IMHO, the warning message should indicate shorter one,
since it is safer.
