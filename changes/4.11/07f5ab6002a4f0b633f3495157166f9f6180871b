cxl: Route eeh events to all slices for pci_channel_io_perm_failure state

Fix a boundary condition where in some cases an eeh event with state ==
pci_channel_io_perm_failure wont be passed on to a driver attached to
the virtual PCI device associated with a slice. This will happen in case
the slice just before (n-1) doesn't have any vPHB bus associated with
it, that results in an early return from cxl_pci_error_detected()
callback.

With state == pci_channel_io_perm_failure, the adapter will be removed
irrespective of the return value of cxl_vphb_error_detected(). So we now
always return PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECTED for this case i.e even if
the AFU isn't using a vPHB (currently returns PCI_ERS_RESULT_NONE).
