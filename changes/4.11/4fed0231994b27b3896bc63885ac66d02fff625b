HID: multitouch: enable the Surface 4 Type Cover Pro (JP) to report multitouch data

Since commit 8fe89ef076fa1 ("HID: multitouch: enable the Surface 3 Type
Cover to report multitouch data"), the TypeCover can be properly handled
by hid-multitouch and don't require any special quirk in the kernel.

Remove the support of the Surface 4 Type Cover Pro (JP) from
hid-microsoft so it can properly report multitouch from the touchpad.
