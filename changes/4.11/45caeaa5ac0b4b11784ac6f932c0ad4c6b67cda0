dccp/tcp: fix routing redirect race

As Eric Dumazet pointed out this also needs to be fixed in IPv6.
v2: Contains the IPv6 tcp/Ipv6 dccp patches as well.

We have seen a few incidents lately where a dst_enty has been freed
with a dangling TCP socket reference (sk->sk_dst_cache) pointing to that
dst_entry. If the conditions/timings are right a crash then ensues when the
freed dst_entry is referenced later on. A Common crashing back trace is:

 #8 [] page_fault at ffffffff8163e648
    [exception RIP: __tcp_ack_snd_check+74]
.
.
 #9 [] tcp_rcv_established at ffffffff81580b64
#10 [] tcp_v4_do_rcv at ffffffff8158b54a
#11 [] tcp_v4_rcv at ffffffff8158cd02

#24 [] do_softirq at ffffffff81016fc5
#25 [] irq_exit at ffffffff81084ee5
#26 [] do_IRQ at ffffffff81648ff8

Of course it may happen with other NIC drivers as well.

It's found the freed dst_entry here:

 224 static bool tcp_in_quickack_mode(struct sock *sk)↩
 225 {↩
 226 ▹       const struct inet_connection_sock *icsk = inet_csk(sk);↩
 227 ▹       const struct dst_entry *dst = __sk_dst_get(sk);↩
 228 ↩
 229 ▹       return (dst && dst_metric(dst, RTAX_QUICKACK)) ||↩
 230 ▹       ▹       (icsk->icsk_ack.quick && !icsk->icsk_ack.pingpong);↩
 231 }↩

But there are other backtraces attributed to the same freed dst_entry in
netfilter code as well.

All the vmcores showed 2 significant clues:

- Remote hosts behind the default gateway had always been redirected to a
different gateway. A rtable/dst_entry will be added for that host. Making
more dst_entrys with lower reference counts. Making this more probable.

- All vmcores showed a postitive LockDroppedIcmps value, e.g:

LockDroppedIcmps                  267

A closer look at the tcp_v4_err() handler revealed that do_redirect() will run
regardless of whether user space has the socket locked. This can result in a
race condition where the same dst_entry cached in sk->sk_dst_entry can be
decremented twice for the same socket via:

do_redirect()->__sk_dst_check()-> dst_release().

Which leads to the dst_entry being prematurely freed with another socket
pointing to it via sk->sk_dst_cache and a subsequent crash.

To fix this skip do_redirect() if usespace has the socket locked. Instead let
the redirect take place later when user space does not have the socket
locked.

The dccp/IPv6 code is very similar in this respect, so fixing it there too.

As Eric Garver pointed out the following commit now invalidates routes. Which
can set the dst->obsolete flag so that ipv4_dst_check() returns null and
triggers the dst_release().
