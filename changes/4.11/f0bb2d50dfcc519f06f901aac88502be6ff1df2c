virtio_balloon: prevent uninitialized variable use

The latest gcc-7.0.1 snapshot reports a new warning:

virtio/virtio_balloon.c: In function 'update_balloon_stats':
virtio/virtio_balloon.c:258:26: error: 'events[2]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]
virtio/virtio_balloon.c:260:26: error: 'events[3]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]
virtio/virtio_balloon.c:261:56: error: 'events[18]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]
virtio/virtio_balloon.c:262:56: error: 'events[17]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]

This seems absolutely right, so we should add an extra check to
prevent copying uninitialized stack data into the statistics.
>From all I can tell, this has been broken since the statistics code
was originally added in 2.6.34.
