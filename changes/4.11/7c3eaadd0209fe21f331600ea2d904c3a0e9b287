staging: fbtft: remove custom DMA mapped buffer

There is no need to duplicate what SPI core already does, i.e. mapping buffers
for DMA capable transfers.

Remove all related pices of code.

Note, that code, besides its redundancy, was buggy: DMA address potentially can
be 0, SPI slave device has nothing to do with DMA capable device properties and
DMA mask in particular.
