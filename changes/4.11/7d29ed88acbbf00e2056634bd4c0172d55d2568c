pinctrl: aspeed: Read and write bits in LPC and GFX controllers

The System Control Unit IP block in the Aspeed SoCs is typically where
the pinmux configuration is found, but not always. A number of pins
depend on state in one of LPC Host Control (LHC) or SoC Display
Controller (GFX) IP blocks, so the Aspeed pinmux drivers should have the
means to adjust these as necessary.

We use syscon to cast a regmap over the GFX and LPC blocks, which is
used as an arbitration layer between the relevant driver and the pinctrl
subsystem. The regmaps are then exposed to the SoC-specific pinctrl
drivers by phandles in the devicetree, and are selected during a mux
request by querying a new 'ip' member in struct aspeed_sig_desc.
