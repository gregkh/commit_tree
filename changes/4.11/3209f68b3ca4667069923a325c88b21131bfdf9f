statx: Include a mask for stx_attributes in struct statx

Include a mask in struct stat to indicate which bits of stx_attributes the
filesystem actually supports.

This would also be useful if we add another system call that allows you to
do a 'bulk attribute set' and pass in a statx struct with the masks
appropriately set to say what you want to set.
