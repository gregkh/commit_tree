spi: rspi: Fixes bogus received byte in qspi_transfer_in()

In qspi_transfer_in(), when receiving the last n (or len) bytes of data,
one bogus byte was written in the receive buffer.
This code leads to a buffer overflow.

"jffs2: jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found
at 0x03b40000: 0x1900 instead
jffs2: jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found
at 0x03b40004: 0x000c instead"

The error message above happens when trying to mount, unmount,
and remount a jffs2-formatted device.
This patch removed the bogus write to fixes: 3be09bec42a800d4
"spi: rspi: supports 32bytes buffer for DUAL and QUAD"

And here is Geert's comment:

"spi: rspi: Fix bogus received byte in qspi_transfer_in()
When there are less than QSPI_BUFFER_SIZE remaining bytes to be received,
qspi_transfer_in() writes one bogus byte in the receive buffer, possibly
leading to a buffer overflow.
This can be reproduced by mounting, unmounting, and remounting a
jffs2-formatted device, causing lots of warnings like:

"jffs2: jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found
at 0x03b40000: 0x1900 instead"

Remove the bogus write to fix this. "
