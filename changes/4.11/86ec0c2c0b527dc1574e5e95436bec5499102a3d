platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Use brightness_set_blocking callback for LEDs

Now a days the LED core can take care of executing brightness_set from
a workqueue if it needs to sleep, make use of this and remove a bunch
of DIY code for this.

Since this commit removes the workqueue usage for LEDs, the
led_sysfs_blink_set callback may now also sleep, this is fine.
