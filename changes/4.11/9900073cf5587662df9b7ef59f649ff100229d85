pwm: lpss: Do not export board infos for different PWM types

The PWM LPSS probe drivers just pass a pointer to the exported board
info structures to pwm_lpss_probe() based on device PCI or ACPI ID.

In order to remove the knowledge of specific devices from library part of
the driver and reduce noise in exported namespace just duplicate the
board info structures and stop exporting them.
