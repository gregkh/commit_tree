mm/autonuma: let architecture override how the write bit should be stashed in a protnone pte.

Patch series "Numabalancing preserve write fix", v2.

This patch series address an issue w.r.t THP migration and autonuma
preserve write feature.  migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page() cannot deal
with concurrent modification of the page.  It does a page copy without
following the migration pte sequence.  IIUC, this was done to keep the
migration simpler and at the time of implemenation we didn't had THP
page cache which would have required a more elaborate migration scheme.
That means thp autonuma migration expect the protnone with saved write
to be done such that both kernel and user cannot update the page
content.  This patch series enables archs like ppc64 to do that.  We are
good with the hash translation mode with the current code, because we
never create a hardware page table entry for a protnone pte.

This patch (of 2):

Autonuma preserves the write permission across numa fault to avoid
taking a writefault after a numa fault (Commit: b191f9b106ea " mm: numa:
preserve PTE write permissions across a NUMA hinting fault").
Architecture can implement protnone in different ways and some may
choose to implement that by clearing Read/ Write/Exec bit of pte.
Setting the write bit on such pte can result in wrong behaviour.  Fix
this up by allowing arch to override how to save the write bit on a
protnone pte.
