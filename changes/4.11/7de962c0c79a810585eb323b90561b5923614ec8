cpufreq: Documentation: Updates based on current code

The cpufreq core has gone though lots of updates in recent times, but on
many occasions the documentation wasn't updated along with the code.
This patch tries to catchup the documentation with the code.

Also add Rafael and Viresh as the contributors to the documentation.

Based on a patch from Claudio Scordino.
