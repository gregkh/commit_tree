Handle mismatched open calls

A signal can interrupt a SendReceive call which result in incoming
responses to the call being ignored. This is a problem for calls such as
open which results in the successful response being ignored. This
results in an open file resource on the server.

The patch looks into responses which were cancelled after being sent and
in case of successful open closes the open fids.

For this patch, the check is only done in SendReceive2()
