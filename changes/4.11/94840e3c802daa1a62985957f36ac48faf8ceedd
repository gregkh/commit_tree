fscrypt: eliminate ->prepare_context() operation

The only use of the ->prepare_context() fscrypt operation was to allow
ext4 to evict inline data from the inode before ->set_context().
However, there is no reason why this cannot be done as simply the first
step in ->set_context(), and in fact it makes more sense to do it that
way because then the policy modes and flags get validated before any
real work is done.  Therefore, merge ext4_prepare_context() into
ext4_set_context(), and remove ->prepare_context().
