tun: fix premature POLLOUT notification on tun devices

aszlig observed failing ssh tunnels (-w) during initialization since
commit cc9da6cc4f56e0 ("ipv6: addrconf: use stable address generator for
ARPHRD_NONE"). We already had reports that the mentioned commit breaks
Juniper VPN connections. I can't clearly say that the Juniper VPN client
has the same problem, but it is worth a try to hint to this patch.

Because of the early generation of link local addresses, the kernel now
can start asking for routers on the local subnet much earlier than usual.
Those router solicitation packets arrive inside the ssh channels and
should be transmitted to the tun fd before the configuration scripts
might have upped the interface and made it ready for transmission.

ssh polls on the interface and receives back a POLL_OUT. It tries to send
the earily router solicitation packet to the tun interface.  Unfortunately
it hasn't been up'ed yet by config scripts, thus failing with -EIO. ssh
doesn't retry again and considers the tun interface broken forever.
