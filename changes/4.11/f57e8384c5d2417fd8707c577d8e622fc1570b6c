arm64: dts: enable the MUSB controller of Pine64 in host-only mode

A64 has a MUSB controller wired to the USB PHY 0, which is connected
to the upper USB Type-A port of Pine64.

As the port is a Type-A female port, enable it in host-only mode in the
device tree, which makes devices with USB Type-A male port can work on
this port (which is originally designed by Pine64 team).
