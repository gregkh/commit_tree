GFS2: Wake up io waiters whenever a flush is done

Before this patch, if a process called function gfs2_log_reserve to
reserve some journal blocks, but the journal not enough blocks were
free, it would call io_schedule. However, in the log flush daemon,
it woke up the waiters only if an gfs2_ail_flush was no longer
required. This resulted in situations where processes would wait
forever because the number of blocks required was so high that it
pushed the journal into a perpetual state of flush being required.

This patch changes the logd daemon so that it wakes up io waiters
every time the log is actually flushed.
