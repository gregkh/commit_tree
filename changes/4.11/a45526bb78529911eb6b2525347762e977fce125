MIPS: MT: Move an assignment for the variable "retval" in mipsmt_sys_sched_setaffinity()

A local variable was set to an error code in one case before a concrete
error situation was detected. Thus move the corresponding assignment into
an if branch to indicate a software failure there.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
