ath10k: fetch firmware images in a loop

To make it easier to handle minimum and maximum firmware API numbers convert
the firmware fetch functionality to a loop. If no firmware image is found print
an error with minimum and maximum API numbers and the name of firmware
directory. This is needed when we switch to using request_firmware_direct()
which doesn't print any errors anymore.

Also add a new function for creating the fw file name dynamically which makes it
easier to add new bus support, for example SDIO and USB, later.
