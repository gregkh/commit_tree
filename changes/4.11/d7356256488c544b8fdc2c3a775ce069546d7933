serial: st-asc: (De)Register GPIOD and swap Pinctrl profiles

When hardware flow-control is disabled, manual toggling of the UART's
reset line (RTS) using userland applications (e.g. stty) is not
possible, since the ASC IP does not provide this functionality in the
same was as some other IPs do.  Thus, we have to do this manually.

This patch ensures that when HW flow-control is disabled the RTS/CTS
lines are free to be registered via the GPIO API.  It also ensures
any registered GPIO lines are unregistered when HW flow-control is
requested, allowing the IP to control them automatically.
