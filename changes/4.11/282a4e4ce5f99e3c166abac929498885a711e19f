platform/x86: Enable Atom PMC platform clocks

The BayTrail and CherryTrail platforms provide platform clocks
through their Power Management Controller (PMC).

The SoC supports up to 6 clocks (PMC_PLT_CLK[0..5]) with a
frequency of either 19.2 MHz (PLL) or 25 MHz (XTAL) for BayTrail
and a frequency of 19.2 MHz (XTAL) for CherryTrail. These clocks
are available for general system use, where appropriate. For example,
the usage for platform clocks suggested in the datasheet is the
following:
  PLT_CLK[0..2] - Camera
  PLT_CLK[3] - Audio Codec
  PLT_CLK[4] -
  PLT_CLK[5] - COMMs
