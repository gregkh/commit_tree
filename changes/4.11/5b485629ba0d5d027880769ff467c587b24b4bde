kprobes, extable: Identify kprobes trampolines as kernel text area

Improve __kernel_text_address()/kernel_text_address() to return
true if the given address is on a kprobe's instruction slot
trampoline.

This can help stacktraces to determine the address is on a
text area or not.

To implement this atomically in is_kprobe_*_slot(), also change
the insn_cache page list to an RCU list.

This changes timings a bit (it delays page freeing to the RCU garbage
collection phase), but none of that is in the hot path.

Note: this change can add small overhead to stack unwinders because
it adds 2 additional checks to __kernel_text_address(). However, the
impact should be very small, because kprobe_insn_pages list has 1 entry
per 256 probes(on x86, on arm/arm64 it will be 1024 probes),
and kprobe_optinsn_pages has 1 entry per 32 probes(on x86).
In most use cases, the number of kprobe events may be less
than 20, which means that is_kprobe_*_slot() will check just one entry.
