IB/core: Restore I/O MMU, s390 and powerpc support

Avoid that the following error message is reported on the console
while loading an RDMA driver with I/O MMU support enabled:

DMAR: Allocating domain for mlx5_0 failed

Ensure that DMA mapping operations that use to_pci_dev() to
access to struct pci_dev see the correct PCI device. E.g. the s390
and powerpc DMA mapping operations use to_pci_dev() even with I/O
MMU support disabled.

This patch preserves the following changes of the DMA mapping updates
patch series:
- Introduction of dma_virt_ops.
- Removal of ib_device.dma_ops.
- Removal of struct ib_dma_mapping_ops.
- Removal of an if-statement from each ib_dma_*() operation.
- IB HW drivers no longer set dma_device directly.
