KVM: s390: Disable dirty log retrieval for UCONTROL guests

User controlled KVM guests do not support the dirty log, as they have
no single gmap that we can check for changes.

As they have no single gmap, kvm->arch.gmap is NULL and all further
referencing to it for dirty checking will result in a NULL
dereference.

Let's return -EINVAL if a caller tries to sync dirty logs for a
UCONTROL guest.

Fixes: 15f36eb ("KVM: s390: Add proper dirty bitmap support to S390 kvm.")
