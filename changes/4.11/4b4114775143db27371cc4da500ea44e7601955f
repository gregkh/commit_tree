mlxsw: spectrum_router: Determine offload status using generic function

The previous patch introduced a generic function to determine whether a
route should be offloaded or not. Make use of it here.

In the future we're going to add more conditions to this test (e.g.,
whether TOS is non-zero), so it makes sense to centralize it instead of
open coding it in a few places.
