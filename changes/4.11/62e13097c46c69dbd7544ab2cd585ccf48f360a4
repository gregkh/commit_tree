net: phy: broadcom: rehook BCM54612E specific init

This extra BCM54612E code in PHY driver isn't really aneg specific. Even
without it aneg works OK but the problem is no packets pass through PHY.

Moreover putting this code inside config_aneg callback didn't allow
resuming PHY correctly. When driver called phy_stop and phy_start it was
putting PHY machine into RESUMING state. After that machine was
switching into AN and NOLINK without ever calling phy_start_aneg. This
prevented this extra setup from being called and PHY didn't work.

This change has been verified to fix network on BCM47186B0 SoC device
with BCM54612E.
