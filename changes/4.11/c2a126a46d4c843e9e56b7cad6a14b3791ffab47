drm/i915: Disable hangcheck when wedged

If the gpu reset fails and the machine is terminally wedged, further
hangchecks achieve nothing but noise. Disable them, with a corollary
that we re-enable hangchecking after a successful GPU reset in case the
user is artificially bringing the machine back to life through the debug
interface.
