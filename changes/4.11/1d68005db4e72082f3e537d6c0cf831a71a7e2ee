i40e: enable mc magic pkt wakeup during power down

This patch adds a call to the mac_address_write admin q function during
power down to update the PRTPM_SAH/SAL registers with the MC_MAG_EN bit
thus enabling multicast magic packet wakeup.

A FW workaround is needed to write the multicast magic wake up enable
bit in the PRTPM_SAH register. The FW expects the mac address write
admin q cmd to be called first with one of the WRITE_TYPE_LAA flags
and then with the multicast relevant flags.

*Note: This solution only works for X722 devices currently. A PFR will
clear the previously mentioned bit by default, but X722 has support for a
WOL_PRESERVE_ON_PFR flag which prevents the bit from being cleared. Once
other devices support this flag, this solution should work as well.
