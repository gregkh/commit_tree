rbd: do away with obj_request in rbd_obj_read_sync()

rbd_obj_request machinery is completely unnecessary here; all that's
being done is fetching a metadata object - no striping, cloning, etc.
More importantly, rbd_osd_req_create() grabs pool id from layout and
that is becoming a data pool id.

Kill offset argument - all metadata objects are small and read in full.
