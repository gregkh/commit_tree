s390: store breaking event address only for program checks

The principles of operations specifies that the breaking event address
is stored to the address 0x110 in the prefix page only for program checks.
The last branch in user space is lost as soon as a branch in kernel space
is executed after e.g. an svc. This makes it impossible to accurately
maintain the breaking event address for a user space process.

Simplify the code, just copy the current breaking event address from
0x110 to the task structure for program checks from user space.
