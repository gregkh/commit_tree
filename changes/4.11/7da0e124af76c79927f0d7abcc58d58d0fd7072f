drm/atomic: Use active instead of enable in wait_for_vblanks.

When DPMS was introduced to atomic, vblanks only worked when the crtc
was enabled and active. wait_for_vblanks were not converted to check for
crtc_state->active, which may cause an attempt for vblank_get to fail.

This is probably harmless, but convert from enable to active anyway.
