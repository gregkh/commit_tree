arm64: include asm/assembler.h in entry-ftrace.S

In a randconfig build I ran into this build error:

arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S: Assembler messages:
arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:101: Error: unknown mnemonic `ldr_l' -- `ldr_l x2,ftrace_trace_function'

The macro is defined in asm/assembler.h, so we should include that file.

Fixes: 829d2bd13392 ("arm64: entry-ftrace.S: avoid open-coded {adr,ldr}_l")
