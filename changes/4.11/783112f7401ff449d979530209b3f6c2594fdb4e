nfsd: special case truncates some more

Both the NFS protocols and the Linux VFS use a setattr operation with a
bitmap of attributes to set to set various file attributes including the
file size and the uid/gid.

The Linux syscalls never mix size updates with unrelated updates like
the uid/gid, and some file systems like XFS and GFS2 rely on the fact
that truncates don't update random other attributes, and many other file
systems handle the case but do not update the other attributes in the
same transaction.  NFSD on the other hand passes the attributes it gets
on the wire more or less directly through to the VFS, leading to updates
the file systems don't expect.  XFS at least has an assert on the
allowed attributes, which caught an unusual NFS client setting the size
and group at the same time.

To handle this issue properly this splits the notify_change call in
nfsd_setattr into two separate ones.
