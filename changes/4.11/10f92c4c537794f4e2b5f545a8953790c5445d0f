KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Add debugfs vgic-state file

Add a file to debugfs to read the in-kernel state of the vgic.  We don't
do any locking of the entire VGIC state while traversing all the IRQs,
so if the VM is running the user/developer may not see a quiesced state,
but should take care to pause the VM using facilities in user space for
that purpose.

We also don't support LPIs yet, but they can be added easily if needed.
