drivers: net: xgene: Fix crash on DT systems

On DT systems the driver require a clock, but the probe just print a
warning and continue, leading to a crash when resetting the device.
To fix this crash and properly handle probe deferals only ignore the
missing clock if DT isn't used or if the clock doesn't exist.
