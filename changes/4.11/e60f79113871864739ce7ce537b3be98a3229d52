ARM: dts: at91: sama5d4: change DMA allocation for secure peripherals

Some peripherals are "Programmable Secure" but left as "Secure" by default.
If tried to be connected to Non-Secure DMA controller, the possibility to
leak secure data is prevented so using these peripherals with DMA1 is not
possible with this default configuration (MATRIX_SPSELR registers setup by
bootloader).
Move them to DMA0 which is an "Always-Secure" DMA controller.
