mm, vmscan: cleanup lru size claculations

lruvec_lru_size returns the full size of the LRU list while we sometimes
need a value reduced only to eligible zones (e.g.  for lowmem requests).
inactive_list_is_low is one such user.  Later patches will add more of
them.  Add a new parameter to lruvec_lru_size and allow it filter out
zones which are not eligible for the given context.
