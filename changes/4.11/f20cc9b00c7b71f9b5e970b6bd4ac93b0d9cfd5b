irqchip/qcom: Add IRQ combiner driver

Driver for interrupt combiners in the Top-level Control and Status
Registers (TCSR) hardware block in Qualcomm Technologies chips.

An interrupt combiner in this block combines a set of interrupts by
OR'ing the individual interrupt signals into a summary interrupt
signal routed to a parent interrupt controller, and provides read-
only, 32-bit registers to query the status of individual interrupts.
The status bit for IRQ n is bit (n % 32) within register (n / 32)
of the given combiner. Thus, each combiner can be described as a set
of register offsets and the number of IRQs managed.
