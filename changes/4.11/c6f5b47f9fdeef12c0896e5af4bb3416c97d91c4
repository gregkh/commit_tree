xprtrdma: Shrink send SGEs array

We no longer need to accommodate an xdr_buf whose pages start at an
offset and cross extra page boundaries. If there are more partial or
whole pages to send than there are available SGEs, the marshaling
logic is now smart enough to use a Read chunk instead of failing.
