pinctrl: core: Fix pinctrl_register_and_init() with pinctrl_enable()

Recent pinctrl changes to allow dynamic allocation of pins exposed one
more issue with the pinctrl pins claimed early by the controller itself.
This caused a regression for IMX6 pinctrl hogs.

Before enabling the pin controller driver we need to wait until it has
been properly initialized, then claim the hogs, and only then enable it.

To fix the regression, split the code into pinctrl_claim_hogs() and
pinctrl_enable(). And then let's require that pinctrl_enable() is always
called by the pin controller driver when ready after calling
pinctrl_register_and_init().

work for hogs")

managing groups")
