KVM: MIPS/MMU: Simplify ASID restoration

KVM T&E uses an ASID for guest kernel mode and an ASID for guest user
mode. The current ASID is saved when the guest is scheduled out, and
restored when scheduling back in, with checks for whether the ASID needs
to be regenerated.

This isn't really necessary as the ASID can be easily determined by the
current guest mode, so lets simplify it to just read the required ASID
from guest_kernel_asid or guest_user_asid even if the ASID hasn't been
regenerated.
