netfilter: nf_ct_helper: warn when not applying default helper assignment

Commit 3bb398d925 ("netfilter: nf_ct_helper: disable automatic helper
assignment") is causing behavior regressions in firewalls, as traffic
handled by conntrack helpers is now by default not passed through even
though it was before due to missing CT targets (which were not necessary
before this commit).

The default had to be switched off due to security reasons [1] [2] and
therefore should stay the way it is, but let's be friendly to firewall
admins and issue a warning the first time we're in situation where packet
would be likely passed through with the old default but we're likely going
to drop it on the floor now.

Rewrite the code a little bit as suggested by Linus, so that we avoid
spaghettiing the code even more -- namely the whole decision making
process regarding helper selection (either automatic or not) is being
separated, so that the whole logic can be simplified and code (condition)
duplication reduced.
