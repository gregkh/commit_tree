rhashtable: Add nested tables

This patch adds code that handles GFP_ATOMIC kmalloc failure on
insertion.  As we cannot use vmalloc, we solve it by making our
hash table nested.  That is, we allocate single pages at each level
and reach our desired table size by nesting them.

When a nested table is created, only a single page is allocated
at the top-level.  Lower levels are allocated on demand during
insertion.  Therefore for each insertion to succeed, only two
(non-consecutive) pages are needed.

After a nested table is created, a rehash will be scheduled in
order to switch to a vmalloced table as soon as possible.  Also,
the rehash code will never rehash into a nested table.  If we
detect a nested table during a rehash, the rehash will be aborted
and a new rehash will be scheduled.
