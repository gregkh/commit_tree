selinux: add security in-core xattr support for tracefs

Since kernel 4.1 ftrace is supported as a new separate filesystem. It
gets automatically mounted by the kernel under the old path
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing. Because it lives now on a separate filesystem
SELinux needs to be updated to also support setting SELinux labels
on tracefs inodes.  This is required for compatibility in Android
when moving to Linux 4.1 or newer.
