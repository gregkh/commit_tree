cpufreq: intel_pstate: Avoid triggering cpu_frequency tracepoint unnecessarily

In the passive mode the cpu_frequency trace event is already
triggered by the cpufreq core or by scaling governors, so
intel_pstate should not trigger it once again for the same
P-state updates.

In addition to that, the frequency returned by
intel_cpufreq_fast_switch() and passed via freqs.new from
intel_cpufreq_target() to cpufreq_freq_transition_end() should
reflect the P-state actually set, so make that happen.
