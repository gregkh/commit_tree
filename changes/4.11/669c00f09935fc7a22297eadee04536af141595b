x86/ras: Flip the TSC-adding logic

Add the TSC value to the MCE record only when the MCE being logged is
precise, i.e., it is logged as an exception or an MCE-related interrupt.

So it doesn't look particularly easy to do without touching/changing a
bunch of places. That's why I'm trying tricks first.

For example, the mce-apei.c case I'm addressing by setting ->tsc only
for errors of panic severity. The idea there is, that, panic errors will
have raised an #MC and not polled.

And then instead of propagating a flag to mce_setup(), it seems
easier/less code to set ->tsc depending on the call sites, i.e.,
are we polling or are we preparing an MCE record in an exception
handler/thresholding interrupt.
