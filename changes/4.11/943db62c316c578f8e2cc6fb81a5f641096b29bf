powerpc/pseries: Revert 'Auto-online hotplugged memory'

This reverts commit ec999072442a ("powerpc/pseries: Auto-online
hotplugged memory"), and 9dc512819e4b ("powerpc: Fix unused function
warning 'lmb_to_memblock'").

Using the auto-online acpability does online added memory but does not
update the associated device struct to indicate that the memory is
online. This causes the pseries memory DLPAR code to fail when trying to
remove a LMB that was previously removed and added back. This happens
when validating that the LMB is removable.

This patch reverts to the previous behavior of calling device_online()
to online the LMB when it is DLPAR added and moves the lmb_to_memblock()
routine out of CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE now that we call it for add.
