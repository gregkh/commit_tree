firmware: qcom: scm: Fix interrupted SCM calls

This patch adds a Qualcomm specific quirk to the arm_smccc_smc call.

On Qualcomm ARM64 platforms, the SMC call can return before it has
completed.  If this occurs, the call can be restarted, but it requires
using the returned session ID value from the interrupted SMC call.

The quirk stores off the session ID from the interrupted call in the
quirk structure so that it can be used by the caller.

This patch folds in a fix given by Sricharan R:
