serial: st-asc: Provide RTS functionality

Until this point, it has not been possible for userland serial
applications (e.g. stty) to toggle the UART RTS line.  This can
be useful with certain configurations. For example, when using
a Mezzanine on a Linaro 96board, RTS line is used to take the
on-board microcontroller in and out of reset.
