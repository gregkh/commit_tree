mm, vmscan: remove unused mm_vmscan_memcg_isolate

Patch series "vm, vmscan: enahance vmscan tracepoints", v2.

While debugging [2] I've realized that there is some room for
improvements in the tracepoints set we offer currently.  I had hard
times to make any conclusion from the existing ones.  The resulting
problem turned out to be active list aging [3] and we are missing at
least two tracepoints to debug such a problem.

Some existing tracepoints could export more information to see _why_ the
reclaim progress cannot be made not only _how much_ we could reclaim.
The later could be seen quite reasonably from the vmstat counters
already.  It can be argued that we are showing too many implementation
details in those tracepoints but I consider them way too lowlevel
already to be usable by any kernel independent userspace.  I would be
_really_ surprised if anything but debugging tools have used them.

Any feedback is highly appreciated.

This patch (of 8):

The trace point is not used since 925b7673cce3 ("mm: make per-memcg LRU
lists exclusive") so it can be removed.
