mac80211_hwsim: check HWSIM_ATTR_RADIO_NAME length

Unfortunately, the nla policy was defined to have HWSIM_ATTR_RADIO_NAME
as an NLA_STRING, rather than NLA_NUL_STRING, so we can't use it as a
NUL-terminated string in the kernel.

Rather than break the API, kasprintf() the string to a new buffer to
guarantee NUL termination.
