net/mlx4_core: Use cq quota in SRIOV when creating completion EQs

When creating EQs to handle CQ completion events for the PF
or for VFs, we create enough EQE entries to handle completions
for the max number of CQs that can use that EQ.

When SRIOV is activated, the max number of CQs a VF (or the PF) can
obtain is its CQ quota (determined by the Hypervisor resource tracker).
Therefore, when creating an EQ, the number of EQE entries that the VF
should request for that EQ is the CQ quota value (and not the total
number of CQs available in the FW).

Under SRIOV, the PF, also must use its CQ quota, because
the resource tracker also controls how many CQs the PF can obtain.

Using the FW total CQs instead of the CQ quota when creating EQs resulted
wasting MTT entries, due to allocating more EQEs than were needed.
