arm64: cpufeature: Expose CPUID registers by emulation

This patch adds the hook for emulating MRS instruction to
export the 'user visible' value of supported system registers.
We emulate only the following id space for system registers:

 Op0=3, Op1=0, CRn=0, CRm=[0, 4-7]

The rest will fall back to SIGILL. This capability is also
advertised via a new HWCAP_CPUID.
