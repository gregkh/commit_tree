arm64: dts: juno: update definition for programmable replicator

Juno platforms have a programmable replicator splitting the trace output
to TPIU and ETR. Currently this is not being programmed as it is being
treated as a none-programmable replicator - which is the default
operational mode for these devices. The TPIU in the system is enabled by
default, and this combination is causing back-pressure in the trace
system resulting in overflows at the source.

Replaces the existing definition with one that defines the programmable
replicator, using the "qcom,coresight-replicator1x" driver that provides
the correct functionality for CoreSight programmable replicators.
