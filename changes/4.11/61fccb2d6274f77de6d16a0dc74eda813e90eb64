ravb: Add tx and rx clock internal delays mode of APSR

This patch enables tx and rx clock internal delay modes (TDM and RDM).

This is to address a failure in the case of 1Gbps communication using the
by salvator-x board with the KSZ9031RNX phy. This has been reported to
occur with both the r8a7795 (H3) and r8a7796 (M3-W) SoCs.

With this change APSR internal delay modes are enabled for
"rgmii-id", "rgmii-rxid" and "rgmii-txid" phy modes as follows:

phy mode   | ASPR delay mode
-----------+----------------
rgmii-id   | TDM and RDM
rgmii-rxid | RDM
rgmii-txid | TDM
