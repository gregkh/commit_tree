rxrpc: Fix potential NULL-pointer exception

Fix a potential NULL-pointer exception in rxrpc_do_sendmsg().  The call
state check that I added should have gone into the else-body of the
if-statement where we actually have a call to check.

Found by CoverityScan CID#1414316 ("Dereference after null check").
