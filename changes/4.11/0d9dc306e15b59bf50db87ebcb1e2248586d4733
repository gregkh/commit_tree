drm/i915: Store a permanent error in obj->mm.pages

Once the object has been truncated, it is unrecoverable. To facilitate
detection of this state store the error in obj->mm.pages.

This is required for the next patch which should be applied to v4.10
(via stable), so we also need to mark this patch for backporting. In
that regard, let's consider this to be a fix/improvement too.

v2: Avoid dereferencing the ERR_PTR when freeing the object.
