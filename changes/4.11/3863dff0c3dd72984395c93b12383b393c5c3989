kvm: fix usage of uninit spinlock in avic_vm_destroy()

If avic is not enabled, avic_vm_init() does nothing and returns early.
However, avic_vm_destroy() still tries to destroy what hasn't been created.
The only bad consequence of this now is that avic_vm_destroy() uses
svm_vm_data_hash_lock that hasn't been initialized (and is not meant
to be used at all if avic is not enabled).

Return early from avic_vm_destroy() if avic is not enabled.
It has nothing to destroy.
