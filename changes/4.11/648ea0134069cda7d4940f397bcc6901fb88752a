net: phy: Allow pre-declaration of MDIO devices

Allow board support code to collect pre-declarations for MDIO devices by
registering them with mdiobus_register_board_info(). SPI and I2C buses
have a similar feature, we were missing this for MDIO devices, but this
is particularly useful for e.g: MDIO-connected switches which need to
provide their port layout (often board-specific) to a MDIO Ethernet
switch driver.
