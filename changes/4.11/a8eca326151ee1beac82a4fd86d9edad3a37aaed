net: remove ndo_neigh_{construct, destroy} from stacked devices

In commit 18bfb924f000 ("net: introduce default neigh_construct/destroy
ndo calls for L2 upper devices") we added these ndos to stacked devices
such as team and bond, so that calls will be propagated to mlxsw.

However, previous commit removed the reliance on these ndos and no new
users of these ndos have appeared since above mentioned commit. We can
therefore safely remove this dead code.
