pinctrl: core: Use delayed work for hogs

Having the pin control framework call pin controller functions
before it's probe has finished is not nice as the pin controller
device driver does not yet have struct pinctrl_dev handle.

Let's fix this issue by adding deferred work for late init. This is
needed to be able to add pinctrl generic helper functions that expect
to know struct pinctrl_dev handle. Note that we now need to call
create_pinctrl() directly as we don't want to add the pin controller
to the list of controllers until the hogs are claimed. We also need
to pass the pinctrl_dev to the device tree parser functions as they
otherwise won't find the right controller at this point.
