tcp: record pkts sent and retransmistted

Add two stats in SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS:

TCP_NLA_DATA_SEGS_OUT: total data packets sent including retransmission
TCP_NLA_TOTAL_RETRANS: total data packets retransmitted

The names are picked to be consistent with corresponding fields in
TCP_INFO. This allows applications that are using the timestamping
API to measure latency stats to also retrive retransmission rate
of application write.
