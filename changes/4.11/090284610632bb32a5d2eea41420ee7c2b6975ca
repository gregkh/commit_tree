scsi: ncr5380: Shorten host info string by removing unused option macros

The DIFFERENTIAL and PARITY option macros are unused: no supported
hardware uses differential signalling and the core driver never
implemented parity checking. These options just waste space in the host
info string.

While we are here, fix a typo in the NCR5380_info() kernel-doc comment.
