ARM: OMAP3: Fix SoC detection of OMAP36/37 Family

The OMAP36/37 families are similar, but there are a few features sections
that can help identify some of them.  Let's add checks for 3630/3730,
OMAP3621, DM3725, OMAP3615/DM3715, OMAP3611, and AM3703 all based on
features similar to what was done for the OMAP34xx/35xx series

The checkpatch flags some warnings for braces, but I kept the coding style
to match the adjacent code for consistency.

I don't have an OMAP36xx to test, but this was tested on both a DM3730 and
AM3703.
