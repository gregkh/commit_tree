net-tc: convert tc_verd to integer bitfields

Extract the remaining two fields from tc_verd and remove the __u16
completely. TC_AT and TC_FROM are converted to equivalent two-bit
integer fields tc_at and tc_from. Where possible, use existing
helper skb_at_tc_ingress when reading tc_at. Introduce helper
skb_reset_tc to clear fields.

Not documenting tc_from and tc_at, because they will be replaced
with single bit fields in follow-on patches.
