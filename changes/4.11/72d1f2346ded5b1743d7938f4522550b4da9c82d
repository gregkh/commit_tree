Input: tm2-touchkey - add touchkey driver support for TM2

This patch adds support for the TM2 touch key and led functionality.

The driver interfaces with userspace through an input device and reports
KEY_PHONE and KEY_BACK event types. LED brightness can be controlled by
"/sys/class/leds/tm2-touchkey/brightness".
