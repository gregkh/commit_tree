drivers/pci/hotplug: Fix initial state for empty slot

In PowerNV PCI hotplug driver, the initial PCI slot's state is set
to PNV_PHP_STATE_POPULATED if no PCI devices are connected to the
slot. The PCI devices that are hot added to the slot won't be probed
and populated because of the check in pnv_php_enable():

        /* Check if the slot has been configured */
        if (php_slot->state != PNV_PHP_STATE_REGISTERED)
                return 0;

This fixes the issue by leaving the slot in PNV_PHP_STATE_REGISTERED
state initially if nothing is connected to the slot.
