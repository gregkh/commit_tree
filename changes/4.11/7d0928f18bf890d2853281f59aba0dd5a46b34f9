arm64: fix erroneous __raw_read_system_reg() cases

Since it was introduced in commit da8d02d19ffdd201 ("arm64/capabilities:
Make use of system wide safe value"), __raw_read_system_reg() has
erroneously mapped some sysreg IDs to other registers.

For the fields in ID_ISAR5_EL1, our local feature detection will be
erroneous. We may spuriously detect that a feature is uniformly
supported, or may fail to detect when it actually is, meaning some
compat hwcaps may be erroneous (or not enforced upon hotplug).

This patch corrects the erroneous entries.
