x86/microcode: Convert to bare minimum MSR accessors

Having tracepoints to the MSR accessors makes them unsuitable for early
microcode loading: think 32-bit before paging is enabled and us chasing
pointers to test whether a tracepoint is enabled or not. Results in a
reliable triple fault.

Convert to the bare ones.
