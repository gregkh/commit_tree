s390/dcssblk: fix device size calculation in dcssblk_direct_access()

Since commit dd22f551 "block: Change direct_access calling convention",
the device size calculation in dcssblk_direct_access() is off-by-one.
This results in bdev_direct_access() always returning -ENXIO because the
returned value is not page aligned.

Fix this by adding 1 to the dev_sz calculation.
