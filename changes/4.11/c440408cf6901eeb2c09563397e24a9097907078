random: convert get_random_int/long into get_random_u32/u64

Many times, when a user wants a random number, he wants a random number
of a guaranteed size. So, thinking of get_random_int and get_random_long
in terms of get_random_u32 and get_random_u64 makes it much easier to
achieve this. It also makes the code simpler.

On 32-bit platforms, get_random_int and get_random_long are both aliased
to get_random_u32. On 64-bit platforms, int->u32 and long->u64.
