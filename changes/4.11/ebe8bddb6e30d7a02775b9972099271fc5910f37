blk-mq: remap queues when adding/removing hardware queues

blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() used to remap hardware queues, which is the
behavior that drivers expect. However, commit 4e68a011428a changed
blk_mq_queue_reinit() to not remap queues for the case of CPU
hotplugging, inadvertently making blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() not remap
queues as well. This breaks, for example, NBD's multi-connection mode,
leaving the added hardware queues unused. Fix it by making
blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() explicitly remap the queues.

Fixes: 4e68a011428a ("blk-mq: don't redistribute hardware queues on a CPU hotplug event")
