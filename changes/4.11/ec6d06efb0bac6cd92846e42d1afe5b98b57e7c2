arm64: Add support for CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL

x86 has an option CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL to do additional checks
on virt_to_phys calls. The goal is to catch users who are calling
virt_to_phys on non-linear addresses immediately. This inclues callers
using virt_to_phys on image addresses instead of __pa_symbol. As features
such as CONFIG_VMAP_STACK get enabled for arm64, this becomes increasingly
important. Add checks to catch bad virt_to_phys usage.
