KVM: MIPS/TLB: Drop kvm_local_flush_tlb_all()

Now that KVM no longer uses wired entries we can safely use
local_flush_tlb_all() when we need to flush the entire TLB (on the start
of a new ASID cycle). This doesn't flush wired entries, which allows
other code to use them without KVM clobbering them all the time. It also
is more up to date, knowing about the tlbinv architectural feature,
flushing of micro TLB on cores where that is necessary (Loongson I
believe), and knows to stop the HTW while doing so.
