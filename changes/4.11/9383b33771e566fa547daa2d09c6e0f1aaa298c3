nfp: don't tell FW about the reserved buffer space

Since commit c0f031bc8866 ("nfp_net: use alloc_frag() and build_skb()")
we are allocating buffers which have to hold both the data and skb to
be created in place by build_skb().

FW should only be told about the buffer space it can DMA to, that
is without the build_skb() headroom and tailroom.  Note: firmware
applications should validate the buffers against both MTU and
free list buffer size so oversized packets would not pass through
the NIC anyway.
