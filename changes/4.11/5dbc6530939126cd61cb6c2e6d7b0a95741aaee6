skfp: hwmtm: Use proper logging macros, correct mismatches

Logging macros should allow format and argument validation.
The DB_TX, DB_RX, and DB_GEN macros did not.

Update the macros and uses and add no_printk validation to the
previously compiled away #ifndef DEBUG variants.

Done with coccinelle and some typing.
