pinctrl: intel: Add Intel Gemini Lake pin controller support

This driver adds pinctrl/GPIO support for Intel Gemini Lake SoC. The
GPIO controller is based on the next generation GPIO hardware but still
compatible with the one supported by the Intel core pinctrl/GPIO driver.

This commit includes material from David E. Box.
