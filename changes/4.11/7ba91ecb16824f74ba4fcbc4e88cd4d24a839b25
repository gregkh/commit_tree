net: for rate-limited ICMP replies save one atomic operation

It is possible to avoid the atomic operation in icmp{v6,}_xmit_lock,
by checking the sysctl_icmp_msgs_per_sec ratelimit before these calls,
as pointed out by Eric Dumazet, but the BH disabled state must be correct.

The icmp_global_allow() call states it must be called with BH
disabled.  This protection was given by the calls icmp_xmit_lock and
icmpv6_xmit_lock.  Thus, split out local_bh_disable/enable from these
functions and maintain it explicitly at callers.
