metag/usercopy: Add missing fixups

The rapf copy loops in the Meta usercopy code is missing some extable
entries for HTP cores with unaligned access checking enabled, where
faults occur on the instruction immediately after the faulting access.

Add the fixup labels and extable entries for these cases so that corner
case user copy failures don't cause kernel crashes.
