target: Fix VERIFY_16 handling in sbc_parse_cdb

As reported by Max, the Windows 2008 R2 chkdsk utility expects
VERIFY_16 to be supported, and does not handle the returned
CHECK_CONDITION properly, resulting in an infinite loop.

The kernel will log huge amounts of this error:

kernel: TARGET_CORE[iSCSI]: Unsupported SCSI Opcode 0x8f, sending
CHECK_CONDITION.
