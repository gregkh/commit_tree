x86/acpi: Restore the order of CPU IDs

The following commits:

  f7c28833c2 ("x86/acpi: Enable acpi to register all possible cpus at
boot time") and 8f54969dc8 ("x86/acpi: Introduce persistent storage
for cpuid <-> apicid mapping")

... registered all the possible CPUs at boot time via ACPI tables to
make the mapping of cpuid <-> apicid fixed. Both enabled and disabled
CPUs could have a logical CPU ID after boot time.

But, ACPI tables are unreliable. the number amd order of Local APIC
entries which depends on the firmware is often inconsistent with the
physical devices. Even if they are consistent, The disabled CPUs which
take up some logical CPU IDs will also make the order discontinuous.

Revert the part of disabled CPUs registration, keep the allocation
logic of logical CPU IDs and also keep some code location changes.
