xfs: improve handling of busy extents in the low-level allocator

Currently we force the log and simply try again if we hit a busy extent,
but especially with online discard enabled it might take a while after
the log force for the busy extents to disappear, and we might have
already completed our second pass.

So instead we add a new waitqueue and a generation counter to the pag
structure so that we can do wakeups once we've removed busy extents,
and we replace the single retry with an unconditional one - after
all we hold the AGF buffer lock, so no other allocations or frees
can be racing with us in this AG.
