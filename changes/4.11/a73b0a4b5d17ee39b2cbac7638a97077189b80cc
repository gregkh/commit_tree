scsi: megaraid_sas: Change RAID_1_10_RMW_CMDS to RAID_1_PEER_CMDS and set value to 2

For RAID1 FastPath writes, driver needs to allocate extra commands
internally to accommodate for the extra peer command being sent.
Currently driver is allocating 2 extra commands for each but only one
extra command is necessary.  Set RAID_1_10_RMW_CMDS to 2 and also change
macro name to RAID_1_PEER_CMDS.
