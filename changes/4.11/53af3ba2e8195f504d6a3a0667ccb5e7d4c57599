KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Allow guest exit path to have MMU on

If we allow LPCR[AIL] to be set for radix guests, then interrupts from
the guest to the host can be delivered by the hardware with relocation
on, and thus the code path starting at kvmppc_interrupt_hv can be
executed in virtual mode (MMU on) for radix guests (previously it was
only ever executed in real mode).

Most of the code is indifferent to whether the MMU is on or off, but
the calls to OPAL that use the real-mode OPAL entry code need to
be switched to use the virtual-mode code instead.  The affected
calls are the calls to the OPAL XICS emulation functions in
kvmppc_read_one_intr() and related functions.  We test the MSR[IR]
bit to detect whether we are in real or virtual mode, and call the
opal_rm_* or opal_* function as appropriate.

The other place that depends on the MMU being off is the optimization
where the guest exit code jumps to the external interrupt vector or
hypervisor doorbell interrupt vector, or returns to its caller (which
is __kvmppc_vcore_entry).  If the MMU is on and we are returning to
the caller, then we don't need to use an rfid instruction since the
MMU is already on; a simple blr suffices.  If there is an external
or hypervisor doorbell interrupt to handle, we branch to the
relocation-on version of the interrupt vector.
