x86/tsc: Fix ART for TSC_KNOWN_FREQ

Subhransu reported that convert_art_to_tsc() isn't working for him.

The ART to TSC relation is only set up for systems which use the refined
TSC calibration. Systems with known TSC frequency (available via CPUID 15)
are not using the refined calibration and therefor the ART to TSC relation
is never established.

Add the setup to the known frequency init path which skips ART
calibration. The init code needs to be duplicated as for systems which use
refined calibration the ART setup must be delayed until calibration has
been done.

The problem has been there since the ART support was introdduced, but only
detected now because Subhransu tested the first time on hardware which has
TSC frequency enumerated via CPUID 15.

Note for stable: The conditional has changed from TSC_RELIABLE to
     	 	 TSC_KNOWN_FREQUENCY.

[ tglx: Rewrote changelog and identified the proper 'Fixes' commit ]
