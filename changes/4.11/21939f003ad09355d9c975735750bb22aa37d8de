usb: host: xhci-plat: enable BROKEN_PED quirk if platform requested

In case 'quirk-broken-port-ped' property is passed in via device property,
we should enable the corresponding BROKEN_PED quirk flag for XHCI core.

[rogerq@ti.com] Updated code from platform data to device property
and added DT binding.
