mm: add new mmget() helper

Apart from adding the helper function itself, the rest of the kernel is
converted mechanically using:

  git grep -l 'atomic_inc.*mm_users' | xargs sed -i 's/atomic_inc(&\(.*\)->mm_users);/mmget\(\1\);/'
  git grep -l 'atomic_inc.*mm_users' | xargs sed -i 's/atomic_inc(&\(.*\)\.mm_users);/mmget\(\&\1\);/'

This is needed for a later patch that hooks into the helper, but might
be a worthwhile cleanup on its own.

(Michal Hocko provided most of the kerneldoc comment.)
