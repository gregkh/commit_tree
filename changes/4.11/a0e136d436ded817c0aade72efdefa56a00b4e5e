Add a driver with gettime method returning hosts realtime clock.
This allows Chrony to synchronize host and guest clocks with
high precision (see results below).

===============================================================================

To configure Chronyd to use PHC refclock, add the
following line to its configuration file:

refclock PHC /dev/ptpX poll 3 dpoll -2 offset 0

Where /dev/ptpX is the kvmclock PTP clock.
