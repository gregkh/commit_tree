net: mvpp2: handle too large value handling in mvpp2_rx_pkts_coal_set()

Currently, mvpp2_rx_pkts_coal_set() does the following to avoid setting
a too large value for the RX coalescing by packet number:

  val = (pkts & MVPP2_OCCUPIED_THRESH_MASK);

This means that if you set a value that is slightly higher the the
maximum number of packets, you in fact get a very low value. It makes a
lot more sense to simply check if the value is too high, and if it's too
high, limit it to the maximum possible value.
