userfaultfd: non-cooperative: rename *EVENT_MADVDONTNEED to *EVENT_REMOVE

Patch series "userfaultfd: non-cooperative: add madvise() event for
MADV_REMOVE request".

These patches add notification of madvise(MADV_REMOVE) event to
non-cooperative userfaultfd monitor.

The first pacth renames EVENT_MADVDONTNEED to EVENT_REMOVE along with
relevant functions and structures.  Using _REMOVE instead of
_MADVDONTNEED describes the event semantics more clearly and I hope it's
not too late for such change in the ABI.

This patch (of 3):

The UFFD_EVENT_MADVDONTNEED purpose is to notify uffd monitor about
removal of certain range from address space tracked by userfaultfd.
Hence, UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE seems to better reflect the operation
semantics.  Respectively, 'madv_dn' field of uffd_msg is renamed to
'remove' and the madvise_userfault_dontneed callback is renamed to
userfaultfd_remove.
