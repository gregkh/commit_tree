selinux: log errors when loading new policy

Adds error logging to the code paths which can fail when loading a new
policy in sel_write_load().  If the policy fails to be loaded from
userspace then a warning message is printed, whereas if a failure occurs
after loading policy from userspace an error message will be printed
with details on where policy loading failed (recreating one of /classes/,
/policy_capabilities/, /booleans/ in the SELinux fs).

Also, if sel_make_bools() fails to obtain an SID for an entry in
/booleans/* an error will be printed indicating the path of the
boolean.
