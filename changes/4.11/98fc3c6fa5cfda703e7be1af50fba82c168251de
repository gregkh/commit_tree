net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: add EEPROM support to 6390

The Marvell 6352 chip has a 8-bit address/16-bit data EEPROM access.
The Marvell 6390 chip has a 16-bit address/8-bit data EEPROM access.

This patch implements the 8-bit data EEPROM access in the mv88e6xxx
driver and adds its support to chips of the 6390 family.
