s390/mm: fix CMMA vs KSM vs others

On heavy paging with KSM I see guest data corruption. Turns out that
KSM will add pages to its tree, where the mapping return true for
pte_unused (or might become as such later).  KSM will unmap such pages
and reinstantiate with different attributes (e.g. write protected or
special, e.g. in replace_page or write_protect_page)). This uncovered
a bug in our pagetable handling: We must remove the unused flag as
soon as an entry becomes present again.
