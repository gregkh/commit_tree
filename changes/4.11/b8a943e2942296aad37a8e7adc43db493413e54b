samples/bpf: add lpm-trie benchmark

Extend the map_perf_test_{user,kern}.c infrastructure to stress test
lpm-trie lookups. We hook into the kprobe on sys_gettid() and measure
the latency depending on trie size and lookup count.

On my Intel Haswell i7-6400U, a single gettid() syscall with an empty
bpf program takes roughly 6.5us on my system. Lookups in empty tries
take ~1.8us on first try, ~0.9us on retries. Lookups in tries with 8192
entries take ~7.1us (on the first _and_ any subsequent try).
