drm/i915: relax uncritical udelay_range() settings

udelay_range(2, 3) is inefficient and as discussions with Jani Nikula
<jani.nikula@linux.intel.com> unnecessary here. This replaces this
tight setting with a relaxed delay of min=20 and max=50. which helps
the hrtimer subsystem optimize timer handling.
