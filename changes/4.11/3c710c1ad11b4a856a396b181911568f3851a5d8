mm, vmscan: extract shrink_page_list reclaim counters into a struct

shrink_page_list returns quite some counters back to its caller.
Extract the existing 5 into struct reclaim_stat because this makes the
code easier to follow and also allows further counters to be returned.

While we are at it, make all of them unsigned rather than unsigned long
as we do not really need full 64b for them (we never scan more than
SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages at once).  This should reduce some stack space.

This patch shouldn't introduce any functional change.
