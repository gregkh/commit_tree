blk-mq-sched: add flush insertion into blk_mq_sched_insert_request()

Instead of letting the caller check this and handle the details
of inserting a flush request, put the logic in the scheduler
insertion function. This fixes direct flush insertion outside
of the usual make_request_fn calls, like from dm via
blk_insert_cloned_request().
