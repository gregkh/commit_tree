nios2: reserve boot memory for device tree

Make sure to reserve the boot memory for the flattened device tree.
Otherwise it might get overwritten, e.g. when initial_boot_params is
copied, leading to a corrupted FDT and a boot hang/crash:

  bootconsole [early0] enabled
  Early console on uart16650 initialized at 0xf8001600
  OF: fdt: Error -11 processing FDT
  Kernel panic - not syncing: setup_cpuinfo: No CPU found in devicetree!

  ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: setup_cpuinfo: No CPU found in devicetree!
