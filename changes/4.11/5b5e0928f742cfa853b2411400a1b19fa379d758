lib/vsprintf.c: remove %Z support

Now that %z is standartised in C99 there is no reason to support %Z.
Unlike %L it doesn't even make format strings smaller.

Use BUILD_BUG_ON in a couple ATM drivers.

In case anyone didn't notice lib/vsprintf.o is about half of SLUB which
is in my opinion is quite an achievement.  Hopefully this patch inspires
someone else to trim vsprintf.c more.
