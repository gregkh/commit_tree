drm/i915/perf: use DRM_DEBUG for userspace issues

Avoid using DRM_ERROR for conditions userspace can trigger with a bad
config when opening a stream or from not reading data in a timely
fashion (whereby the OA buffer fills up). These conditions are tested
by i-g-t which treats error messages as failures if using the test
runner. This wasn't an issue while the i915-perf igt tests were being
run in isolation.

One message relating to seeing a spurious zeroed report was changed to
use DRM_NOTE instead of DRM_ERROR. Ideally this warning shouldn't be
seen, but it's not a serious problem if it is. Considering that the
tail margin mechanism is only a heuristic it's possible we might see
this from time to time.
