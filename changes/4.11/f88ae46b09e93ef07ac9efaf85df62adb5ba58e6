xfs: glean crc status from mp not flags in xfs_btree_init_block_int

xfs_btree_init_block_int() can determine whether crcs are
in effect without the passed-in XFS_BTREE_CRC_BLOCKS flag;
the mp argument allows us to determine this from the
superblock.  Remove the flag from callers, and use
xfs_sb_version_hascrc(&mp->m_sb) internally instead.

This removes one difference between the if & else cases
in the callers.
