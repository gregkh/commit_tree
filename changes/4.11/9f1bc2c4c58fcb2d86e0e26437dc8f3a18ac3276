ALSA: hda/realtek - Cannot adjust speaker's volume on a Dell AIO

The issue is the same as "dd9aa335c880 ALSA: hda/realtek - Can't adjust
speaker's volume on a Dell AIO", the output requires to connect to a node
with Amp-out capability.

Applying the same fixup "ALC298_FIXUP_SPK_VOLUME" can fix the issue.
