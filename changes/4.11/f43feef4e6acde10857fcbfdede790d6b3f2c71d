amd-xgbe: Fix the ECC-related bit position definitions

The ECC bit positions that describe whether the ECC interrupt is for
Tx, Rx or descriptor memory and whether the it is a single correctable
or double detected error were defined in incorrectly (reversed order).
Fix the bit position definitions for these settings so that the proper
ECC handling is performed.
