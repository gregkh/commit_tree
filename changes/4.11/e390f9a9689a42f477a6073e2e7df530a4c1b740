objtool, modules: Discard objtool annotation sections for modules

The '__unreachable' and '__func_stack_frame_non_standard' sections are
only used at compile time.  They're discarded for vmlinux but they
should also be discarded for modules.

Since this is a recurring pattern, prefix the section names with
".discard.".  It's a nice convention and vmlinux.lds.h already discards
such sections.

Also remove the 'a' (allocatable) flag from the __unreachable section
since it doesn't make sense for a discarded section.
