Revert "crypto: arm64/ARM: NEON accelerated ChaCha20"

This patch reverts the following commits:

8621caa0d45e731f2e9f5889ff5bb384fcd6e059
8096667273477e735b0072b11a6d617ccee45e5f

I should not have applied them because they had already been
obsoleted by a subsequent patch series.  They also cause a build
failure because of the subsequent commit 9ae433bc79f9.

Fixes: 9ae433bc79f ("crypto: chacha20 - convert generic and...")
