[media] staging: lirc_bt829: remove

This driver is for an old mach64 VT board, which also has a framebuffer
driver (atyfb) and userspace mach64 X driver.

It was merged in 2010 and noone has attempted to port it to rc-core,
which would be necessary to get it out of staging.

I have not been able to track down the hardware either.
