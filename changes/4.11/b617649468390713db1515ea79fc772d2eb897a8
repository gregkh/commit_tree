MIPS: ip27: Disable qlge driver in defconfig

One of the last remaining failures in kernelci.org is for a gcc bug:

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/qlge_main.c:4819:1: error: insn does not satisfy its constraints:
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/qlge_main.c:4819:1: internal compiler error: in extract_constrain_insn, at recog.c:2190

This is apparently broken in gcc-6 but fixed in gcc-7, and I cannot
reproduce the problem here. However, it is clear that ip27_defconfig
does not actually need this driver as the platform has only PCI-X but
not PCIe, and the qlge adapter in turn is PCIe-only.

The driver was originally enabled in 2010 along with lots of other
drivers.
