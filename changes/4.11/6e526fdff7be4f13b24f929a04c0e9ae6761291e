net: wimax/i2400m: fix NULL-deref at probe

Make sure to check the number of endpoints to avoid dereferencing a
NULL-pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array should a
malicious device lack the expected endpoints.

The endpoints are specifically dereferenced in the i2400m_bootrom_init
path during probe (e.g. in i2400mu_tx_bulk_out).

and reset backends")
