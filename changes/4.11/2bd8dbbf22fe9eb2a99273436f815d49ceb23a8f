apparmor: add ns being viewed as a param to policy_view_capable()

Prepare for a tighter pairing of user namespaces and apparmor policy
namespaces, by making the ns to be viewed available and checking
that the user namespace level is the same as the policy ns level.

This strict pairing will be relaxed once true support of user namespaces
lands.
