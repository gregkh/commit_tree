fscrypt: use EEXIST when file already uses different policy

As part of an effort to clean up fscrypt-related error codes, make
FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY fail with EEXIST when the file already uses
a different encryption policy.  This is more descriptive than EINVAL,
which was ambiguous with some of the other error cases.

I am not aware of any users who might be relying on the previous error
code of EINVAL, which was never documented anywhere.

This failure case will be exercised by an xfstest.
