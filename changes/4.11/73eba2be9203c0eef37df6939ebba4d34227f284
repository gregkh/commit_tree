scsi: ufs: fix arguments order some trace calls

Colin Ian King reported that with commit 7ff5ab473633 ("scsi: ufs: add
tracing support") static analysis is reporting that we may have swapped
arguments on calls to:

    trace_ufshcd_runtime_resume,
    trace_ufshcd_runtime_suspend,
    trace_ufshcd_system_suspend,
    trace_ufshcd_system_resume,
and trace_ufshcd_init

Where:
    hba->uic_link_state is passed to dev_state
    hba->curr_dev_pwr_mode is passed to link_state

This wasn't intentional so it's a bug. This change fixed this bug.
