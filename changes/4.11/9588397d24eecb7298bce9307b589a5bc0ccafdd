i40e: remove unnecessary __packed

'struct i40e_dma_mem' defined with 'packed' directive causing kernel
unaligned errors on sparc.

e.g.
i40e: Intel(R) Ethernet Connection XL710 Network Driver - version
1.6.16-k
i40e: Copyright (c) 2013 - 2014 Intel Corporation.

This can be fixed with get_unaligned/put_unaligned(). However no
reference in driver shows that 'struct i40e_dma_mem' directly shoved
into NIC hardware. But instead fields of the struct are being read and
used for hardware. Therefore, __packed is unnecessary for 'struct
i40e_dma_mem'.

In addition, although 'struct i40e_virt_mem' doesn't cause any
unaligned access, keeping it packed is unnecessary as well because
of aforementioned reason.

This change make 'struct i40e_dma_mem' and 'struct i40e_virt_mem'
unpacked.
