Input: tsc2004/5 - fix regulator handling

In case of an optional regulator missing, regulator core will return
ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) and not NULL, so the check for missing regulator is
incorrect. Also, the regulator is not optional, it may simply be missing
from platform description, so let's use devm_regulator_get() and rely on
regulator core to give us dummy supply when real one is not available.
