fuse: add missing FR_FORCE

fuse_file_put() was missing the "force" flag for the RELEASE request when
sending synchronously (fuseblk).

If this flag is not set, then a sync request may be interrupted before it
is dequeued by the userspace filesystem.  In this case the OPEN won't be
balanced with a RELEASE.
