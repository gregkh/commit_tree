drm/i915: Reject set-tiling-ioctl with stride==0 and a tiling mode

In commit 957870f93412 ("drm/i915: Split out i915_gem_object_set_tiling()"),
I swapped an alignment check for IS_ALIGNED and in the process removed
the less-than check. That check turns out to be important as it was the
only rejection for stride == 0. Tvrtko did spot it, but I was
overconfident in the IS_ALIGNED() conversion.
