IB/mlx5: Remove deprecated module parameter

Commit 9603b61de1ee ("mlx5: Move pci device handling from mlx5_ib
to mlx5_core") moved prof_sel module parameter from mlx5_ib to mlx5_core
and marked it as deprecated in 2014.

Three years after deprecation, it is time to remove the deprecated
module parameter.
