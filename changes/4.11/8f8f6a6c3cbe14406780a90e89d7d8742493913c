drm: Add drm_framebuffer_plane_{width,height}()

Add variants of drm_format_plane_{width,height}() that take an entire fb
object instead of just the format. These should be more efficent as they
can just look up the format info from the fb->format pointer rather than
having to look it up (using a linear search based on the format).
