usb: chipidea: msm: Mux over secondary phy at the right time

We need to pick the correct phy at runtime based on how the SoC
has been wired onto the board. If the secondary phy is used, take
it out of reset and mux over to it by writing into the TCSR
register. Make sure to do this on reset too, because this
register is reset to the default value (primary phy) after the
RESET bit is set in USBCMD.
