NVME Initiator: Base modifications

This patch adds base modifications for NVME initiator support.

The base modifications consist of:
- Formal split of SLI3 rings from SLI-4 WQs (sometimes referred to as
  rings as well) as implementation now widely varies between the two.
- Addition of configuration modes:
   SCSI initiator only; NVME initiator only; NVME target only; and
   SCSI and NVME initiator.
   The configuration mode drives overall adapter configuration,
   offloads enabled, and resource splits.
   NVME support is only available on SLI-4 devices and newer fw.
- Implements the following based on configuration mode:
  - Exchange resources are split by protocol; Obviously, if only
     1 mode, then no split occurs. Default is 50/50. module attribute
     allows tuning.
  - Pools and config parameters are separated per-protocol
  - Each protocol has it's own set of queues, but share interrupt
    vectors.
     SCSI:
       SLI3 devices have few queues and the original style of queue
         allocation remains.
       SLI4 devices piggy back on an "io-channel" concept that
         eventually needs to merge with scsi-mq/blk-mq support (it is
	 underway).  For now, the paradigm continues as it existed
	 prior. io channel allocates N msix and N WQs (N=4 default)
	 and either round robins or uses cpu # modulo N for scheduling.
	 A bunch of module parameters allow the configuration to be
	 tuned.
     NVME (initiator):
       Allocates an msix per cpu (or whatever pci_alloc_irq_vectors
         gets)
       Allocates a WQ per cpu, and maps the WQs to msix on a WQ #
         modulo msix vector count basis.
       Module parameters exist to cap/control the config if desired.
  - Each protocol has its own buffer and dma pools.

I apologize for the size of the patch.
