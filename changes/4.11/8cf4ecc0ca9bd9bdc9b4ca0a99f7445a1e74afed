KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Enable radix guest support

This adds a few last pieces of the support for radix guests:

* Implement the backends for the KVM_PPC_CONFIGURE_V3_MMU and
  KVM_PPC_GET_RMMU_INFO ioctls for radix guests

* On POWER9, allow secondary threads to be on/off-lined while guests
  are running.

* Set up LPCR and the partition table entry for radix guests.

* Don't allocate the rmap array in the kvm_memory_slot structure
  on radix.

* Don't try to initialize the HPT for radix guests, since they don't
  have an HPT.

* Take out the code that prevents the HV KVM module from
  initializing on radix hosts.

At this stage, we only support radix guests if the host is running
in radix mode, and only support HPT guests if the host is running in
HPT mode.  Thus a guest cannot switch from one mode to the other,
which enables some simplifications.
