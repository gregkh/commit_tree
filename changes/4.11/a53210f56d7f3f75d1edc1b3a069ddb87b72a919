mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: avoid possible overflow of timeout value

Fixes: a45c6cb81647 ("[ARM] 5369/1: omap mmc: Add new omap
hsmmc controller for 2430 and 34xx, v3")

when using really large timeout (up to 4*60*1000 ms for bkops)
there is a possibility of data overflow using
unsigned int so use 64 bit unsigned long long.
