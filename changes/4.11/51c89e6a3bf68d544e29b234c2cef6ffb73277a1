afs: Conditionalise a new unused variable

The bulk readpages support introduced a harmless warning:

fs/afs/file.c: In function 'afs_readpages_page_done':
fs/afs/file.c:270:20: error: unused variable 'vnode' [-Werror=unused-variable]

This adds an #ifdef to match the user of that variable.  The user of the
variable has to be conditional because it accesses a member of a struct
that is also conditional.
