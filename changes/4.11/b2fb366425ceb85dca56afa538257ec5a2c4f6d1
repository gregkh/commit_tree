common: DMA-mapping: add DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED attribute

This patch adds the DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED attribute to the DMA-mapping
subsystem.

Some advanced peripherals such as remote processors and GPUs perform
accesses to DMA buffers in both privileged "supervisor" and unprivileged
"user" modes.  This attribute is used to indicate to the DMA-mapping
subsystem that the buffer is fully accessible at the elevated privilege
level (and ideally inaccessible or at least read-only at the
lesser-privileged levels).
