tcp: tcp_get_info() should read tcp_time_stamp later

Commit b369e7fd41f7 ("tcp: make TCP_INFO more consistent") moved
lock_sock_fast() earlier in tcp_get_info()

This has the minor effect that jiffies value being sampled at the
beginning of tcp_get_info() is more likely to be off by one, and we
report big tcpi_last_data_sent values (like 0xFFFFFFFF).

Since we lock the socket, fetching tcp_time_stamp right before
doing the jiffies_to_msecs() calls is enough to remove these
wrong values.
