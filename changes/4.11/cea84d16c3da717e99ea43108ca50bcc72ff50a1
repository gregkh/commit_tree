drm/i915: Remove the rounding down of the gen4+ fence region

Restricting the fence to the end of the previous tile-row breaks access
to the final portion of the object. On gen2/3 we employed lazy fencing
to pad out the fence with scratch page to provide access to the tail,
and now we also pad out the object on gen4+ we can apply the same fix.
