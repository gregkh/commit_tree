cpufreq: ti: Add cpufreq driver to determine available OPPs at runtime

Some TI SoCs, like those in the AM335x, AM437x, DRA7x, and AM57x families,
have different OPPs available for the MPU depending on which specific
variant of the SoC is in use. This can be determined through use of the
revision and an eFuse register present in the silicon. Introduce a
ti-cpufreq driver that can read the aformentioned values and provide
them as version matching data to the opp framework. Through this the
opp-supported-hw dt binding that is part of the operating-points-v2
table can be used to indicate availability of OPPs for each device.

This driver also creates the "cpufreq-dt" platform_device after passing
the version matching data to the OPP framework so that the cpufreq-dt
handles the actual cpufreq implementation. Even without the necessary
data to pass the version matching data the driver will still create this
device to maintain backwards compatibility with operating-points v1
tables.
