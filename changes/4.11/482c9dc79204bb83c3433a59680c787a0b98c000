qla2xxx: Change scsi host lookup method.

For target mode, when new scsi command arrive, driver first performs
a look up of the SCSI Host. The current look up method is based on
the ALPA portion of the NPort ID. For Cisco switch, the ALPA can
not be used as the index. Instead, the new search method is based
on the full value of the Nport_ID via btree lib.
