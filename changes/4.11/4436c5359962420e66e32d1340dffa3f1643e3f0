mmc: sdhci-msm: Remove platform_execute_tuning from sdhci_msm_ops

platform_execute_tuning should not really exist as it does not
do anything useful.

So remove this ops and directly plug sdhci_msm_execute_tuning
with mmc_host_ops.

Also in case of HS400 tuning clear SDHCI_HS400_TUNING flag once
HS400 related mode selection is done.
