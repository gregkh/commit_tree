hwmon: (fam15h_power) use permission-specific DEVICE_ATTR variants

Use DEVICE_ATTR_RO for read only attributes and DEVICE_ATTR_RW for
read/write attributes. This simplifies the source code, improves
readbility, and reduces the chance of inconsistencies.

The conversion was done automatically using coccinelle. It was validated
by compiling both the old and the new source code and comparing its text,
data, and bss size.
