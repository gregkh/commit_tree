xfs: make xfs_btree_magic more generic

Right now the xfs_btree_magic() define takes only a cursor;
change this to take crc and btnum args to make it more generically
useful, and move to a function.

This will allow xfs_btree_init_block_int callers which don't
have a cursor to make use of the xfs_magics array, which will
happen in the next patch.
