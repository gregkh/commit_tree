MIPS: init: Ensure bootmem does not corrupt reserved memory

Current init code initialises bootmem allocator with all of the low
memory that it assumes is available, but does not check for reserved
memory block, which can lead to corruption of data that may be stored
there.
Move bootmem's allocation map to a location that does not cross any
reserved regions
