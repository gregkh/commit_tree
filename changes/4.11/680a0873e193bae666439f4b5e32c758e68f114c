arm: kernel: Add SMC structure parameter

This patch adds a quirk parameter to the arm_smccc_(smc/hvc) calls.
The quirk structure allows for specialized SMC operations due to SoC
specific requirements.  The current arm_smccc_(smc/hvc) is renamed and
macros are used instead to specify the standard arm_smccc_(smc/hvc) or
the arm_smccc_(smc/hvc)_quirk function.

This patch and partial implementation was suggested by Will Deacon.
