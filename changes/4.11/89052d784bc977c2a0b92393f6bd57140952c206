IB/cma: Add default RoCE TOS to CMA configfs

Add new entry to the RDMA-CM configfs that allows users
to select default TOS for RDMA-CM QPs.

This is useful for users that want to control the TOS for legacy
applications without changing their code.

Application that sets the TOS explicitly using the rdma_set_option
API will continue to work as expected, meaning overriding the configfs
value.
