nl80211: fix dumpit error path RTNL deadlocks

Sowmini pointed out Dmitry's RTNL deadlock report to me, and it turns out
to be perfectly accurate - there are various error paths that miss unlock
of the RTNL.

To fix those, change the locking a bit to not be conditional in all those
nl80211_prepare_*_dump() functions, but make those require the RTNL to
start with, and fix the buggy error paths. This also let me use sparse
(by appropriately overriding the rtnl_lock/rtnl_unlock functions) to
validate the changes.
