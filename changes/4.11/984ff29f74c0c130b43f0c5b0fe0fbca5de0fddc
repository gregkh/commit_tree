drm/i915: Simplify testing for am-I-the-kernel-context?

The kernel context (dev_priv->kernel_context) is unique in that it is
not associated with any user filp - it is the only one with
ctx->file_priv == NULL. This is a simpler test than comparing it against
dev_priv->kernel_context which involves some pointer dancing.

In checking that this is true, we notice that the gvt context is
allocating itself a i915_hw_ppgtt it doesn't use and not flagging that
its file_priv should be invalid.
