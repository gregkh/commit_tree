zswap: clear compressor or zpool param if invalid at init

If either the compressor and/or zpool param are invalid at boot, and
their default value is also invalid, set the param to the empty string
to indicate there is no compressor and/or zpool configured.  This allows
users to check the sysfs interface to see which param needs changing.
