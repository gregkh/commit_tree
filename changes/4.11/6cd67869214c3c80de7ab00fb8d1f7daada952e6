staging: lustre: ksocklnd: ignore timedout TX on closing connection

ksocklnd reaper thread always tries to close the connection for the
first timedout zero-copy TX. This is wrong if this connection is
already being closed, because the reaper will see the same TX again
and again and cannot find out other timedout zero-copy TXs and close
connections for them.
