mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: remove default broken-cd for ARM

Initially all QorIQ platforms were PowerPC architecture and they didn't
support card detection except several platforms. The driver added the
quirk SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION as default and this made broken-cd
property in dts node didn't work. Now QorIQ platform turns to ARM
architecture and most of them could support card detection. However it's
a large number of dts trees that need to be fixed with broken-cd if we
remove the default SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION in driver. And the
users don't want to see this. So this patch is to remove this default
quirk just for ARM and keep it for PowerPC.(Note, QorIQ PowerPC platform
only has big-endian eSDHC while QorIQ ARM platform has big-endian or
little-endian eSDHC) This makes broken-cd property work again for ARM.
