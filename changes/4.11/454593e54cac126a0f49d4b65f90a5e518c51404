drivers/pci/hotplug: Mask PDC interrupt if required

We're supporting surprise hotplug on PCI slots behind root port
or PCIe switch downstream ports, which don't claim the capability
in hardware register (offset: PCIe cap + PCI_EXP_SLTCAP). PEX8718
is one of the examples. For those PCI slots, the PDC (Presence
Detection Change) event isn't reliable and the underly (skiboot)
firmware has best judgement.

This masks the PDC event when skiboot requests by "ibm,slot-broken-pdc"
property in PCI slot's device-tree node.
