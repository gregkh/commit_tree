lib: add CONFIG_TEST_SORT to enable self-test of sort()

Along with the addition made to Kconfig.debug, the prior existing but
permanently disabled test function has been slightly refactored.

Patch has been tested using QEMU 2.1.2 with a .config obtained through
'make defconfig' (x86_64) and manually enabling the option.
