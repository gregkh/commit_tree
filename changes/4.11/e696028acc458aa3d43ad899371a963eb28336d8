net/sched: Reflect HW offload status

Currently there is no way of querying whether a filter is
offloaded to HW or not when using "both" policy (where none
of skip_sw or skip_hw flags are set by user-space).

Add two new flags, "in hw" and "not in hw" such that user
space can determine if a filter is actually offloaded to
hw or not. The "in hw" UAPI semantics was chosen so it's
similar to the "skip hw" flag logic.

If none of these two flags are set, this signals running
over older kernel.
