phy: qcom-ufs: Remove -always-on property

The fact that a regulator is always-on is a property of the regulator,
not a specific consumer. Implementing this in the driver leads to a
system behaviour that is dependent on if the Qualcomm UFS PHY was ever
(partially) probed.

If the specific regulator should be always on in a particular device,
mark it so by specifying "regulator-always-on" in the regulator node.
