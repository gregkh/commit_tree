ALSA: hda - add DP MST audio support

This patch adds the DP MST audio support on i915 platform and
it will enable dyn_pcm_assign feature.

DP MST supports several device entry on the same port and each
device entry can map to one pcm stream. For example, on i915,
there are 3 pins, and each pin has 3 device entries. This means
there should be 3x3 pcms. However, there is only 3 pipe lines in
i915. This means 3 pcms are actived at most at the same moment.
We will create 5 pcms (pin number + dev entry num - 1) in this case.
For the details, please refer commit a76056f2e57e
("ALSA: hda - hdmi dynamically bind PCM to pin when monitor hotplug")

Each device entry is a virtual pin. It is described by pin_nid and dev_id
in struct hdmi_spec_per_pin.
