x86/microcode/AMD: Rework container parsing

It was pretty clumsy before and the whole work of parsing the microcode
containers was spread around the functions wrongly.

Clean it up so that there's a main scan_containers() function which
iterates over the microcode blob and picks apart the containers glued
together. For each container, it calls a parse_container() helper which
concentrates on one container only: sanity-checking, parsing, counting
microcode patches in there, etc.

It makes much more sense now and it is actually very readable. Oh, and
we luvz a diffstat removing more crap than adding.
