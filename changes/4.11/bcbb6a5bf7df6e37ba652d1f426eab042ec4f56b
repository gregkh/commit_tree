sched/headers: Move 'struct user_struct' definition and APIs to the new <linux/sched/user.h> header

'struct user_struct' was added to sched.h historically, but it's actually
entirely independent of task_struct and of scheduler details, so move
it to its own header.

Fix up .c files using those facilities.
