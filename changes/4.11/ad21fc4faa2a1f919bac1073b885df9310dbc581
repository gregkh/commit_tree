arch: Move CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA and CONFIG_SET_MODULE_RONX to be common

There are multiple architectures that support CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA and
CONFIG_SET_MODULE_RONX. These options also now have the ability to be
turned off at runtime. Move these to an architecture independent
location and make these options def_bool y for almost all of those
arches.
