net: netcp: ale: add proper ale entry mask bits for netcp switch ALE

For NetCP NU Switch ALE, some of the mask bits are different than
defaults used in the driver. Add a new macro DEFINE_ALE_FIELD1 that use
a configurable mask bits and use it in the driver. These bits are set to
correct values by using the new variables added to cpsw_ale structure
and re-used in the macros. The parameter nu_switch_ale is configured by
the caller driver to indicate the ALE is for that switch and is used in
the ALE driver to do customization as needed.
