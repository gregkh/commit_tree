KVM: arm/arm64: Move cntvoff to each timer context

Make cntvoff per each timer context. This is helpful to abstract kvm
timer functions to work with timer context without considering timer
types (e.g. physical timer or virtual timer).

This also would pave the way for ever doing adjustments of the cntvoff
on a per-CPU basis if that should ever make sense.
