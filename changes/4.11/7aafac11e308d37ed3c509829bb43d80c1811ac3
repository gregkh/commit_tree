powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Gracefully fail if too many TCE levels requested

The IODA2 specification says that a 64 DMA address cannot use top 4 bits
(3 are reserved and one is a "TVE select"); bottom page_shift bits
cannot be used for multilevel table addressing either.

The existing IODA2 table allocation code aligns the minimum TCE table
size to PAGE_SIZE so in the case of 64K system pages and 4K IOMMU pages,
we have 64-4-12=48 bits. Since 64K page stores 8192 TCEs, i.e. needs
13 bits, the maximum number of levels is 48/13 = 3 so we physically
cannot address more and EEH happens on DMA accesses.

This adds a check that too many levels were requested.

It is still possible to have 5 levels in the case of 4K system page size.
