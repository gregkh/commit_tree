sock: add sk_dst_pending_confirm flag

Add new sock flag to allow sockets to confirm neighbour.
When same struct dst_entry can be used for many different
neighbours we can not use it for pending confirmations.
As not all call paths lock the socket use full word for
the flag.

Add sk_dst_confirm as replacement for dst_confirm when
called for received packets.
