tools: Provide a definition of WARN_ON

The definition of WARN_ON being used by the radix tree test suite was
deficient in two ways: it did not provide a return value, and it stopped
execution instead of continuing.  This version of WARN_ON tells you
which file & line the assertion was triggered in.
