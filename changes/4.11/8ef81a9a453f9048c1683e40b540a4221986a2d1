KVM: x86: hide KVM_HC_CLOCK_PAIRING on 32 bit

The newly added hypercall doesn't work on x86-32:

arch/x86/kvm/x86.c: In function 'kvm_pv_clock_pairing':
arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:6163:6: error: implicit declaration of function 'kvm_get_walltime_and_clockread';did you mean 'kvm_get_time_scale'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

This adds an #ifdef around it, matching the one around the related
functions that are also only implemented on 64-bit systems.
