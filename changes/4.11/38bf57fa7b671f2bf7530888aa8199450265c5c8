drm/hisilicon: Don't set drm_device->platformdev

It's deprecated and only should be used by drivers which still use
drm_platform_init, not by anyone else.

And indeed it's entirely unused and can be nuked.

This required a bit more fudging, but I guess kirin_dc_ops really
wants to operate on the platform_device, not something else. Also
bonus points for implementing abstraction, and then storing the vfunc
in a global variable.

v2: Don't break the build soooo badly :(
Note that the cleanup function is a bit confused: ade_data was never
set as drvdata, and calling drm_crtc_cleanup directly is a bug - this
is called indirectly through drm_mode_config_cleanup, which calls into
crtc->destroy, which already has the call to drm_crtc_cleanup. Which
means we can just nuke it.

Note this is the 2nd attempt after the first one failed and had to be
reverted again in
