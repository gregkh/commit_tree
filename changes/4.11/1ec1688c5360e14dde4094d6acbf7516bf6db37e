orangefs: free superblock when mount fails

Otherwise lockdep says:

[ 1337.483798] ================================================
[ 1337.483999] [ BUG: lock held when returning to user space! ]
[ 1337.484252] 4.11.0-rc6 #19 Not tainted
[ 1337.484423] ------------------------------------------------
[ 1337.484626] mount/14766 is leaving the kernel with locks still held!
[ 1337.484841] 1 lock held by mount/14766:
[ 1337.485017]  #0:  (&type->s_umount_key#33/1){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff8124171f>] sget_userns+0x2af/0x520

Caught by xfstests generic/413 which tried to mount with the unsupported
mount option dax.  Then xfstests generic/422 ran sync which deadlocks.
