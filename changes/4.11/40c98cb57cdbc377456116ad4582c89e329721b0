crypto: caam - fix RNG deinstantiation error checking

RNG instantiation was previously fixed by
commit 62743a4145bb9 ("crypto: caam - fix RNG init descriptor ret. code checking")
while deinstantiation was not addressed.

Since the descriptors used are similar, in the sense that they both end
with a JUMP HALT command, checking for errors should be similar too,
i.e. status code 7000_0000h should be considered successful.
