staging: unisys: visorbus: Convert references to /proc to /sys

Removes references to visorchipset in the /proc filesystem, and replaces
them with references to the /sys filesystem. Also removes reference to the
visorchipset driver, and replaces it with a reference to plain
visorchipset (since it is no longer a standalone driver).
