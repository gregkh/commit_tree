drm/i915: relax uncritical udelay_range()

udelay_range(1, 2) is inefficient and as discussions with Jani Nikula
<jani.nikula@linux.intel.com> unnecessary here. This replaces this
tight setting with a relaxed delay of min=20 and max=50 which helps
the hrtimer subsystem optimize timer handling.

Fixes: commit be4fc046bed3 ("drm/i915: add VLV DSI PLL Calculations")
