jbd2: don't leak modified metadata buffers on an aborted journal

If the journal has been aborted, we shouldn't mark the underlying
buffer head as dirty, since that will cause the metadata block to get
modified.  And if the journal has been aborted, we shouldn't allow
this since it will almost certainly lead to a corrupted file system.
