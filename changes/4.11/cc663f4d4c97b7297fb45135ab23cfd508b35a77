tcp: restrict F-RTO to work-around broken middle-boxes

The recent extension of F-RTO 89fe18e44 ("tcp: extend F-RTO
to catch more spurious timeouts") interacts badly with certain
broken middle-boxes.  These broken boxes modify and falsely raise
the receive window on the ACKs. During a timeout induced recovery,
F-RTO would send new data packets to probe if the timeout is false
or not. Since the receive window is falsely raised, the receiver
would silently drop these F-RTO packets. The recovery would take N
(exponentially backoff) timeouts to repair N packet losses.  A TCP
performance killer.

Due to this unfortunate situation, this patch removes this extension
to revert F-RTO back to the RFC specification.
