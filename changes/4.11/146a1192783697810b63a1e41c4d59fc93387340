afs: Fix the maths in afs_fs_store_data()

afs_fs_store_data() works out of the size of the write it's going to make,
but it uses 32-bit unsigned subtraction in one place that gets
automatically cast to loff_t.

However, if to < offset, then the number goes negative, but as the result
isn't signed, this doesn't get sign-extended to 64-bits when placed in a
loff_t.

Fix by casting the operands to loff_t.
