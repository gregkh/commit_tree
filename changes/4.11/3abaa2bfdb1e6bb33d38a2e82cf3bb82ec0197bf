tcmu: allow hw_max_sectors greater than 128

tcmu hard codes the hw_max_sectors to 128 which is a litle small.
Userspace uses the max_sectors to report the optimal IO size and
some initiators perform better with larger IOs (open-iscsi seems
to do better with 256 to 512 depending on the test).

(Fix do not display hw max sectors twice - MNC)
