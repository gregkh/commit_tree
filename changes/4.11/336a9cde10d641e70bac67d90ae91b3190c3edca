hrtimer: Catch invalid clockids again

commit 82e88ff1ea94 ("hrtimer: Revert CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW support") removed
unfortunately a sanity check in the hrtimer code which was part of that
MONOTONIC_RAW patch series.

It would have caught the bogus usage of CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW in the wireless
code. So bring it back.

It is way too easy to take any random clockid and feed it to the hrtimer
subsystem. At best, it gets mapped to a monotonic base, but it would be
better to just catch illegal values as early as possible.
    
Detect invalid clockids, map them to CLOCK_MONOTONIC and emit a warning.

[ tglx: Replaced the BUG by a WARN and gracefully map to CLOCK_MONOTONIC ]
