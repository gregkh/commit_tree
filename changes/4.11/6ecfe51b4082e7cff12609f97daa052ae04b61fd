Input: refuse to register absolute devices without absinfo

If device is supposed to send absolute events (i.e. EV_ABS bit is set in
dev->evbit) but dev->absinfo is not allocated, then the driver has done
something wrong, and we should not register such device. Otherwise we'll
crash later, when driver tries to send absolute event.
