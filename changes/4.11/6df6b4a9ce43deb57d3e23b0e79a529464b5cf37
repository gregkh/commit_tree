IB/cma: Destination and source addr families must match

The destination address in a listening rdma_id does not have an address
family. Since address family in both sides of a connection must be the
same in rdma_bind_addr() we set the address family of the destination to
the address family of the source.

This patch serves the logic in cma_port_is_unique() which requires to
know if destination address that is associated with a rdma_id is any address
(cma_zero_addr() and cma_loopback_addr()).

This can happen when port reuse is checked for a port number
that is being listened to.
