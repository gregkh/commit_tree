ASoC: soc-core: remove OF adjusting for snd_soc_of_parse_card_name

Because prototype of OF-graph sound card support didn't have Sound Card
node, commit 8f5ebb1bee15b5720741a98414767bb86f6c2b23
("ASoC: soc-core: adjust for graph on snd_soc_of_parse_card_name")
adjusted to it on each functions.

But final discussion result of ALSA SoC / OF-graph ML, OF-graph sound
card has node. Thus, this commit became no longer needed.

This reverts commit 8f5ebb1bee15b5720741a98414767bb86f6c2b23.
