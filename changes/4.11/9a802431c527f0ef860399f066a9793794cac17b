arm64: cacheinfo: add support to override cache levels via device tree

The cache hierarchy can be identified through Cache Level ID(CLIDR)
architected system register. However in some cases it will provide
only the number of cache levels that are integrated into the processor
itself. In other words, it can't provide any information about the
caches that are external and/or transparent.

Some platforms require to export the information about all such external
caches to the userspace applications via the sysfs interface.

This patch adds support to override the cache levels using device tree
to take such external non-architected caches into account.
