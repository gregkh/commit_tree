platform/x86: add support for devices with Silead touchscreens

On ACPI based tablets, the ACPI touchscreen node only contains info on
the gpio and the irq, and is missing any info on the axis. This info is
expected to be built into the tablet model specific version of the driver
shipped with the os-image for the device.

Add support for getting the missing info from a table built into the
driver, using dmi data to identify which entry of the table to use and
add info for the CUBE iwork8 Air and Jumper EZpad mini3 tablets on which
this code was tested / developed.
