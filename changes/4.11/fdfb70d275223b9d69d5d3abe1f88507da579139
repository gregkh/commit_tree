netvsc: fix calculation of available send sections

My change (introduced in 4.11) to use find_first_clear_bit
incorrectly assumed that the size argument was words, not bits.
The effect was only a small limited number of the available send
sections were being actually used. This can cause performance loss
with some workloads.

Since map_words is now used only during initialization, it can
be on stack instead of in per-device data.
