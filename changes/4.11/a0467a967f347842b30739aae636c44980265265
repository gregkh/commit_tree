USB: serial: ch341: fix modem-status handling

The modem-status register was read as part of device configuration at
port_probe and then again at open (and reset-resume). During open (and
reset-resume) the MSR was read before submitting the interrupt URB,
something which could lead to an MSR-change going unnoticed when it
races with open (reset-resume).

Fix this by dropping the redundant reconfiguration of the port at every
open, and only read the MSR after the interrupt URB has been submitted.
