bridge: fdb: converge fdb_delete_by functions into one

We can simplify the logic of entries pointing to the bridge by
converging the fdb_delete_by functions, this would allow us to use the
same function for both cases since the fdb's dst is set to NULL if it is
pointing to the bridge thus we can always check for a port match.
