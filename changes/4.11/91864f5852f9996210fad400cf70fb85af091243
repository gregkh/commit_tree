net: use net->count to check whether a netns is alive or not

The previous idea was to check whether a net namespace is in
net_exit_list or not. It doesn't work, because net->exit_list is used in
__register_pernet_operations and __unregister_pernet_operations where
all namespaces are added to a temporary list to make cleanup in a error
case, so list_empty(&net->exit_list) always returns false.
