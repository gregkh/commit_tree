clk: wm831x: fix usleep_range with bad range

The delay here is not in atomic context and does not seem critical with
respect to precision, but usleep_range(min,max) with min==max results in
giving the timer subsystem no room to optimize uncritical delays. Fix
this by setting the range to 2000,3000 us.
