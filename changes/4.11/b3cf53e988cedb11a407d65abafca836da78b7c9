can: flexcan: add support for timestamp based rx-offload

The flexcan IP core has 64 mailboxes. For now they are configured for
RX as a hardware FIFO. This FIFO has a fixed depth of 6 CAN frames. In
some high load scenarios it turns out thas this buffer is too small.

In order to have a buffer larger than the 6 frames FIFO, this patch adds
support for timestamp based offloading via the generic rx-offload
infrastructure.
