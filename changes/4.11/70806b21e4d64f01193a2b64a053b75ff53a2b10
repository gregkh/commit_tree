sched/headers: Move the 'root_task_group' declaration to <linux/sched/autogroup.h>

Also remove the duplicate declaration from <linux/init_task.h>.

( That declaration was originally duplicated for dependency hell reasons,
  but there's no problem including the much smaller <linux/sched/autogroup.h>
  header now, to pick up the right prototype. )
