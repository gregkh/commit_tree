tpm: fix RC value check in tpm2_seal_trusted

The error code handling is broken as any error code that has the same
bits set as TPM_RC_HASH passes. Implemented tpm2_rc_value() helper to
parse the error value from FMT0 and FMT1 error codes so that these types
of mistakes are prevented in the future.
