coresight: etm4x: Fix timestamp configuration when working from perf

When using the ETM4x tracers from the perf interface two trace options are
available: cycle accurate and timestamp.

Enabling the timestamp feature is done by setting TRCCONFIGR.TS (bit 11).
The position of the timestamp bit in that register coincidentally happens
to be the same as what was chosen to enable timestamping from the 'mode'
sysFS entry.  The code does the right thing but the semantic is wrong.

This patch sets TRCCONFIGR.TS explicitly, as it is done from the sysFS
interface.  That way timestamps are set the same way from both perf and
sysFS and there is no misunderstanding as to what is intended.
