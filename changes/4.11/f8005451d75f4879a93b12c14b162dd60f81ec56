tmpfs: change shmem_mapping() to test shmem_aops

Callers of shmem_mapping() are interested in whether the mapping is swap
backed - except for uprobes, which is interested in whether it should
use shmem_read_mapping_page().  All these callers are better served by a
shmem_mapping() which checks for shmem_aops, than the current version
which goes through several indirections to find where the inode lives -
and has the surprising effect that a private mmap of /dev/zero satisfies
both vma_is_anonymous() and shmem_mapping(), when that device node is on
devtmpfs.  I don't think anything in the tree suffers from that
surprise, but it caught me out, and is better fixed.
