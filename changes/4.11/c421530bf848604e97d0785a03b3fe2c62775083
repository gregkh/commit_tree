scsi: aacraid: Reorder Adapter status check

The driver currently checks the SELF_TEST_FAILED first and then
KERNEL_PANIC next. Under error conditions(boot code failure) both
SELF_TEST_FAILED and KERNEL_PANIC can be set at the same time.

The driver has the capability to reset the controller on an KERNEL_PANIC,
but not on SELF_TEST_FAILED.

Fixed by first checking KERNEL_PANIC and then the others.
