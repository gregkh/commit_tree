drm: remove unnecessary fault wrappers

The fault wrappers drm_vm_fault(), drm_vm_shm_fault(),
drm_vm_dma_fault() and drm_vm_sg_fault() used to provide extra logic
beyond what was in the "drm_do_*" versions of these functions, but as of
commit ca0b07d9a969 ("drm: convert drm from nopage to fault") they are
just unnecessary wrappers that do nothing.

Remove them, and rename the the drm_do_* fault handlers to remove the
"do_" since they no longer have corresponding wrappers.
