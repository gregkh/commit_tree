fbdev: omap/lcd: Remove no-op driver callbacks

Every single one of the OMAP fbdev LCD drivers implements no-op remove,
suspend and resume callbacks for their platform_driver. This is not
necessary as the driver core handles the case where the callbacks are not
set just fine. So they are just unnecessary boilerplate that can be
removed.
