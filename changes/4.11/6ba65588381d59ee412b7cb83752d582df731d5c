scsi: ufs: add host state prints in failure cases

Whenever some UFS failure occurs the driver prints the UFS
registers in order to help with analysis of the failure.
However this may not be sufficient in some cases, so having
the host controller state as it is represented and managed in
the driver will contribute to analysis efforts.
Added prints of various fields in the hba struct which may be
of interest.
