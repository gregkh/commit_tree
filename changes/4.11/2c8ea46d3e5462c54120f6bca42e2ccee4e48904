usb: chipidea: msm: Mark device as runtime pm active

We're not properly marking the glue layer/wrapper device as
runtime active, so runtime PM believes that the hardware state is
inactive when we call pm_runtime_enable() in this driver. This
causes a problem when the glue layer has a power domain
associated with it, because runtime PM will go and disable the
power domain to match the 'inactive' state of the device. Let's
mark the device as active so that runtime PM doesn't improperly
power down this device when it's actually active.
