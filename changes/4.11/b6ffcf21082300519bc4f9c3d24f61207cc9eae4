serial: 8250_omap: Add OMAP_DMA_TX_KICK quirk for AM437x

UART uses as EDMA as dma engine on AM437x SoC and therefore, requires
OMAP_DMA_TX_KICK quirk just like AM33xx. So, enable OMAP_DMA_TX_KICK
quirk for AM437x platform as well. While at that, drop use of
of_machine_is_compatible() and instead pass quirks via device data.
