KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Implement support for userspace access

Read and write of some registers like ISPENDR and ICPENDR
from userspace requires special handling when compared to
guest access for these registers.

Refer to Documentation/virtual/kvm/devices/arm-vgic-v3.txt
for handling of ISPENDR, ICPENDR registers handling.

Add infrastructure to support guest and userspace read
and write for the required registers
Also moved vgic_uaccess from vgic-mmio-v2.c to vgic-mmio.c
