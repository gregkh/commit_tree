serial: omap: Add omapserial earlycon

Add DT earlycon for omap_serial driver. This boot console is included
with CONFIG_SERIAL_EARLYCON=y, CONFIG_OF=y, CONFIG_SERIAL_OMAP=y, and
CONFIG_OF_EARLY_FLATTREE=y.

This boot console is enabled with the command line option "earlycon"
(without "=<name>...") when the DT 'stdout-path' property matches a
compatible uart.
