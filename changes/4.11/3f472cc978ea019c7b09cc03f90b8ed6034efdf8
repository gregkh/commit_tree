mm/shmem.c: fix unlikely() test of info->seals to test only for WRITE and GROW

Running my likely/unlikely profiler, I discovered that the test in
shmem_write_begin() that tests for info->seals as unlikely, is always
incorrect.  This is because shmem_get_inode() sets info->seals to have
F_SEAL_SEAL set by default, and it is unlikely to be cleared when
shmem_write_begin() is called.  Thus, the if statement is very likely.

But as the if statement block only cares about F_SEAL_WRITE and
F_SEAL_GROW, change the test to only test those two bits.
