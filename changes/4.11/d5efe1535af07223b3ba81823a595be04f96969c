rtlwifi: Move items out of rtl_pci_priv and rtl_usb_priv

In commit 6773386f977c ("rtlwifi: rtl8192c-common: Fix "BUG: KASAN:"),
a BUG detected when CONFIG_KASAN=y was fixed by reordering the layouts
of struct rtl_pci_priv, and struct rtl_usb_priv so that the variables
used by both PCI and USB drivers have the same offsets in both structs.
The better fix of relocating the critical variables into struct rtl_priv
was deferred as these changes do not have to be applied to stable
kernels.

This change also removes CamelCase variables with pLed0 => pled0.
