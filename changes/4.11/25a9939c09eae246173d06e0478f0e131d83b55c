drm/irq: drm_legacy_ prefix for legacy ioctls

Spotted while auditing our ioctl table. Also nuke the
not-really-kerneldoc comments, we don't document internals and
definitely don't want to mislead people with the old dragons.

I think with this all the legacy ioctls now have proper drm_legacy_
prefixes.
