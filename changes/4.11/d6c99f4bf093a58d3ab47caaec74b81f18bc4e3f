dma-fence: Wrap querying the fence->status

The fence->status is an optional field that is only valid once the fence
has been signaled. (Driver may fill the fence->status with an error code
prior to calling dma_fence_signal().) Given the restriction upon its
validity, wrap querying of the fence->status into a helper
dma_fence_get_status().
