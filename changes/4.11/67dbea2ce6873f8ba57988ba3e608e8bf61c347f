CIFS: Fix SMB3 mount without specifying a security mechanism

Commit ef65aaede23f ("smb2: Enforce sec= mount option") changed the
behavior of a mount command to enforce a specified security mechanism
during mounting. On another hand according to the spec if SMB3 server
doesn't respond with a security context it implies that it supports
NTLMSSP. The current code doesn't keep it in mind and fails a mount
for such servers if no security mechanism is specified. Fix this by
indicating that a server supports NTLMSSP if a security context isn't
returned during negotiate phase. This allows the code to use NTLMSSP
by default for SMB3 mounts.
