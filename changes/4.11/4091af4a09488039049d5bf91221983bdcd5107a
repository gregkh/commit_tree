staging: lustre: Fix variable type declaration after refactoring

A recent clean-up declared och_flags as a int rather than fmode_t. This
lead to the following sparse warning:

drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/llite/file.c:106:30: warning: restricted
fmode_t degrades to integer

This patch fixes this issue.
