tools/power turbostat: print system config, unless --quiet

Some users want turbostat to tell them everything, by default.
Some users want turbostat to be quiet, by default.

I find that I'm in the 1st camp, and so I've never liked
needing to type the --debug parameter to decode the system
configuration.

So here we change the default and print the system configuration,
by default.  (The --debug option is now un-documented, though
it does still exist for debugging turbostat internals)

When you do not want to see the system configuration
header, use the new "--quiet" option.
