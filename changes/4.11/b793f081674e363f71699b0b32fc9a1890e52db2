The problem is caused by emac_dt_phy_probe() returing success (0)
for existing device-trees configurations that do not specify a
"phy-handle" property. This caused the code to skip the existing
phy probe and setup. Which led to essential phy related
data-structures being uninitialized.

This patch also removes the unused variable in emac_dt_phy_connect().
