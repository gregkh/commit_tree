serial: exar: Fix initialization of EXAR registers for ports > 0

So far, pci_xr17v35x_setup always initialized 8XMODE, FCTR & Co. for
port 0 because it used the address of that port instead of moving the
pointer according to the port number. Fix this and remove the unneeded
temporary ioremap by moving default_setup up and reusing the membase it
fills into the port structure.
