Documentation: stable-kernel-rules: fix stable-tag format

A patch documenting how to specify which kernels a particular fix should
be backported to (seemingly) inadvertently added a minus sign after the
kernel version. This particular stable-tag format had never been used
prior to this patch, and was neither present when the patch in question
was first submitted (it was added in v2 without any comment).

Drop the minus sign to avoid any confusion.
