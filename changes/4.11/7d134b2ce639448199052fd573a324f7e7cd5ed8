kprobes: move kprobe declarations to asm-generic/kprobes.h

Often all is needed is these small helpers, instead of compiler.h or a
full kprobes.h.  This is important for asm helpers, in fact even some
asm/kprobes.h make use of these helpers...  instead just keep a generic
asm file with helpers useful for asm code with the least amount of
clutter as possible.

Likewise we need now to also address what to do about this file for both
when architectures have CONFIG_HAVE_KPROBES, and when they do not.  Then
for when architectures have CONFIG_HAVE_KPROBES but have disabled
CONFIG_KPROBES.

Right now most asm/kprobes.h do not have guards against CONFIG_KPROBES,
this means most architecture code cannot include asm/kprobes.h safely.
Correct this and add guards for architectures missing them.
Additionally provide architectures that not have kprobes support with
the default asm-generic solution.  This lets us force asm/kprobes.h on
the header include/linux/kprobes.h always, but most importantly we can
now safely include just asm/kprobes.h on architecture code without
bringing the full kitchen sink of header files.

Two architectures already provided a guard against CONFIG_KPROBES on its
kprobes.h: sh, arch.  The rest of the architectures needed gaurds added.
We avoid including any not-needed headers on asm/kprobes.h unless
kprobes have been enabled.

In a subsequent atomic change we can try now to remove compiler.h from
include/linux/kprobes.h.

During this sweep I've also identified a few architectures defining a
common macro needed for both kprobes and ftrace, that of the definition
of the breakput instruction up.  Some refer to this as
BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION.  This must be kept outside of the #ifdef
CONFIG_KPROBES guard.
