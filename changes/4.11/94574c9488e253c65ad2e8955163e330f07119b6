KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Add distributor and redistributor access

VGICv3 Distributor and Redistributor registers are accessed using
KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS and KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_REDIST_REGS
with KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR and KVM_GET_DEVICE_ATTR ioctls.
These registers are accessed as 32-bit and cpu mpidr
value passed along with register offset is used to identify the
cpu for redistributor registers access.

The version of VGIC v3 specification is defined here
Documentation/virtual/kvm/devices/arm-vgic-v3.txt

Also update arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h to compile for
AArch32 mode.
