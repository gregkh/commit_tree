sh: sh7724: Don't use a public mmc header for MMC_PROGRESS*

The enum that specifies the MMC_PROGRESS* types, is a sh mmcif specific
thing and has no relevance in a public mmc header. Currently it's used only
by the sh romImage MMCIF boot, so let's instead define the enum in there
and rename the types to MMCIF_* to show this.
