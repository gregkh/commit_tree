staging: lustre: statahead: drop support for remote entry

This patch dropped support for remote entry statahead, because it
needs 2 async RPCs to fetch both LOOKUP lock from parent MDT and
UPDATE lock from client MDT, which is complicated. Plus not
supporting remote entry statahead won't cause any issue.

* pack child fid in statahead request.
* lmv_intent_getattr_async() will compare parent and child MDT,
  if child is remote, return -ENOTSUPP.
