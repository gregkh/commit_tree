afs: Populate and use client modification time

The inode timestamps should be set from the client time
in the status received from the server, rather than the
server time which is meant for internal server use.

Set AFS_SET_MTIME and populate the mtime for operations
that take an input status, such as file/dir creation
and StoreData.  If an input time is not provided the
server will set the vnode times based on the current server
time.

In a situation where the server has some skew with the
client, this could lead to the client seeing a timestamp
in the future for a file that it just created or wrote.
