iommu: Disambiguate MSI region types

The introduction of reserved regions has left a couple of rough edges
which we could do with sorting out sooner rather than later. Since we
are not yet addressing the potential dynamic aspect of software-managed
reservations and presenting them at arbitrary fixed addresses, it is
incongruous that we end up displaying hardware vs. software-managed MSI
regions to userspace differently, especially since ARM-based systems may
actually require one or the other, or even potentially both at once,
(which iommu-dma currently has no hope of dealing with at all). Let's
resolve the former user-visible inconsistency ASAP before the ABI has
been baked into a kernel release, in a way that also lays the groundwork
for the latter shortcoming to be addressed by follow-up patches.

For clarity, rename the software-managed type to IOMMU_RESV_SW_MSI, use
IOMMU_RESV_MSI to describe the hardware type, and document everything a
little bit. Since the x86 MSI remapping hardware falls squarely under
this meaning of IOMMU_RESV_MSI, apply that type to their regions as well,
so that we tell the same story to userspace across all platforms.

Secondly, as the various region types require quite different handling,
and it really makes little sense to ever try combining them, convert the
bitfield-esque #defines to a plain enum in the process before anyone
gets the wrong impression.
