clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Add dt binding for hisilicon-161010101 erratum

This erratum describes a bug in logic outside the core, so MIDR can't be
used to identify its presence, and reading an SoC-specific revision
register from common arch timer code would be awkward.  So, describe it
in the device tree.
