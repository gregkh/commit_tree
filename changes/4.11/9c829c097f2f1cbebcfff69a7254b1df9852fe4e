of: device: Support loading a module with OF based modalias

In the case of ULPI devices, we want to be able to load the
driver before registering the device so that we don't get stuck
in a loop waiting for the phy module to appear and failing usb
controller probe. Currently we request the ulpi module via the
ulpi ids, but in the DT case we might need to request it with the
OF based modalias instead. Add a common function that allows
anyone to request a module with the OF based modalias.
