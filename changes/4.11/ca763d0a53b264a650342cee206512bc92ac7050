dm cache: fix corruption seen when using cache > 2TB

A rounding bug due to compiler generated temporary being 32bit was found
in remap_to_cache().  A localized cast in remap_to_cache() fixes the
corruption but this preferred fix (changing from uint32_t to sector_t)
eliminates potential for future rounding errors elsewhere.
