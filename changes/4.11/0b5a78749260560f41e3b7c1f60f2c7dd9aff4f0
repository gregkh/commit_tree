netfilter: nf_tables: add space notation to sets

The space notation allows us to classify the set backend implementation
based on the amount of required memory. This provides an order of the
set representation scalability in terms of memory. The size field is
still left in place so use this if the userspace provides no explicit
number of elements, so we cannot calculate the real memory that this set
needs. This also helps us break ties in the set backend selection
routine, eg. two backend implementations provide the same performance.
