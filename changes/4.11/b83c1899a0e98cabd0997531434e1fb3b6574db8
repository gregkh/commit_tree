PM / OPP: Use dev_pm_opp_get_opp_table() instead of _add_opp_table()

Migrate all users of _add_opp_table() to use dev_pm_opp_get_opp_table()
to guarantee that the OPP table doesn't get freed while being used.

Also update _managed_opp() to get the reference to the OPP table.

Now that the OPP table wouldn't get freed while these routines are
executing after dev_pm_opp_get_opp_table() is called, there is no need
to take opp_table_lock. Drop them as well.

Now that _add_opp_table(), _remove_opp_table() and the unlocked release
routines aren't used anymore, remove them.
