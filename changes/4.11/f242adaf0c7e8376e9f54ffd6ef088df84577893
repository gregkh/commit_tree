KVM: arm/arm64: Set up a background timer for the physical timer emulation

Set a background timer for the EL1 physical timer emulation while VMs
are running, so that VMs get the physical timer interrupts in a timely
manner.

Schedule the background timer on entry to the VM and cancel it on exit.
This would not have any performance impact to the guest OSes that
currently use the virtual timer since the physical timer is always not
enabled.
