x86/ioapic: Restore IO-APIC irq_chip retrigger callback

commit d32932d02e18 removed the irq_retrigger callback from the IO-APIC
chip and did not add it to the new IO-APIC-IR irq chip.

There is no harm because the interrupts are resent in software when the
retrigger callback is NULL, but it's less efficient. So restore them.
