IB/ipoib: Remove the unnecessary error check

The function ipoib_mcast_start_thread/ipoib_ib_dev_up always return zero.
As such, in the function ipoib_open, err_stop will never be reached.
So remove this err_stop and change the return type of the function
ipoib_mcast_start_thread/ipoib_ib_dev_up to void.
