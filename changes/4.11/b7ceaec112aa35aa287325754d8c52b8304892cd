x86/asm: Tidy up TSS limit code

In an earlier version of the patch ("x86/kvm/vmx: Defer TR reload
after VM exit") that introduced TSS limit validity tracking, I
confused which helper was which.  On reflection, the names I chose
sucked.  Rename the helpers to make it more obvious what's going on
and add some comments.

While I'm at it, clear __tss_limit_invalid when force-reloading as
well as when contitionally reloading, since any TR reload fixes the
limit.
