ASoC: wm_adsp: Set booted/running flags at the end of bring up

The booted and running flags should really only be set once all the
steps at that power level have been complete. Currently operations can
fail after the flags have been set, which would leave us in an
inconsistent state where the flags are set but the things expected to
reach that level have not happened. Whilst there isn't really any major
impact from this it is best to clean it up.
