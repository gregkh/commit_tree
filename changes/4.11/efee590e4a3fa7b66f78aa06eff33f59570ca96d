fscrypt: pass up error codes from ->get_context()

It was possible for the ->get_context() operation to fail with a
specific error code, which was then not returned to the caller of
FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY or FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY.  Make sure
to pass through these error codes.  Also reorganize the code so that
->get_context() only needs to be called one time when setting an
encryption policy, and handle contexts of unrecognized sizes more
appropriately.
