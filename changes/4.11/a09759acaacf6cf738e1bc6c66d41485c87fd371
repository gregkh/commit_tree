zram: remove waitqueue for IO done

zram_reset_device() waits for ongoing writepage pages to be completed by
zram->refcount logic.  However, it's pointless because before the reset,
we prevent further opening of zram by zram->claim and flush all of
pending IO by fsync_bdev so there should be no pending IO at the
zram_reset_device().

So let's remove that code which is even broken due to the lack of
wake_up elsewhere.
