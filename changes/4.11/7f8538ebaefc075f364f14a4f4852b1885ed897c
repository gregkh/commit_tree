PM / OPP: Fix memory leak while adding duplicate OPPs

There are two types of duplicate OPPs that get different behavior from
the core:
A) An earlier OPP is marked 'available' and has same freq/voltages as
   the new one.
B) An earlier OPP with same frequency, but is marked 'unavailable' OR
   doesn't have same voltages as the new one.

The OPP core returns 0 for the first one, but -EEXIST for the second.

While the OPP core returns 0 for the first case, its callers don't free
the newly allocated OPP structure which isn't used anymore. Fix that by
returning -EBUSY instead of 0, but make the callers return 0 eventually.

As this isn't a critical fix, its not getting marked for stable kernel.
