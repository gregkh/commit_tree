mtd: spi-nor: remove WARN_ONCE() message in spi_nor_write()

This patch removes the WARN_ONCE() test in spi_nor_write().
This macro triggers the display of a warning message almost every time we
use a UBI file-system because a write operation is performed at offset 64,
which is in the middle of the SPI NOR memory page. This is a valid
operation for ubifs.

Hence this warning is pretty annoying and useless so we just remove it.
