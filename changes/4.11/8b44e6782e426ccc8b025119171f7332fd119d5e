mfd: axp20x: Add missing axp288 irqs

The axp288 has the following irqs 2 times: VBUS_FALL, VBUS_RISE,
VBUS_OV. On boot / reset the enable flags for both the normal and alt
version of these irqs is set.

Since we were only listing the normal version in the axp288 regmap_irq
struct, we were never disabling the alt versions of these irqs.

Add the alt versions to the axp288 regmap_irq struct, so that these
get properly disabled.

Together with the other axp288 fixes in this series, this fixes the axp288
irq contineously triggering.
