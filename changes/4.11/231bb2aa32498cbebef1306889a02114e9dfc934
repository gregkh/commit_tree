perf pmu: Support event aliases for non cpu// pmus

The code for handling pmu aliases without specifying the PMU hardcoded
only supported the cpu PMU.

This patch extends it to work for all PMUs. We always duplicate the
event for all PMUs that have an matching alias.  This allows to
automatically expand an alias for all instances of a PMU (so for example
you can monitor all cache boxes with a single event)
