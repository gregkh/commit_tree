arm64: dts: marvell: adjust name of sd-mmc-gop clock in syscon

This commit adjusts the names of gatable clock #18 of the Marvell Armada
CP110 system controller. This clock not only controls SD/MMC, but also
the GOP (Group Of Ports) used for networking. So the clock is renamed to
{cpm,cps}-sd-mmc-gop instead of {cpm,cps}-sd-mmc.
