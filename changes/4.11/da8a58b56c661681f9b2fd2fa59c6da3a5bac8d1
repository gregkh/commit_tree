perf tools: Replace _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF with max_present_cpu in cpu_topology_map

There are 2 problems wrt. cpu_topology_map on systems with sparse CPUs:

1. offline/absent CPUs will have their socket_id and core_id set to -1
   which triggers:
   "socket_id number is too big.You may need to upgrade the perf tool."

2. size of cpu_topology_map (perf_env.cpu[]) is allocated based on
   _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF, but can be indexed with CPU ids going above.
   Users of perf_env.cpu[] are using CPU id as index. This can lead
   to read beyond what was allocated:
   ==19991== Invalid read of size 4
   ==19991==    at 0x490CEB: check_cpu_topology (topology.c:69)
   ==19991==    by 0x490CEB: test_session_topology (topology.c:106)
   ...

For example:
  _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF == 16
  available: 2 nodes (0-1)
  node 0 cpus: 0 6 8 10 16 22 24 26
  node 0 size: 12004 MB
  node 0 free: 9470 MB
  node 1 cpus: 1 7 9 11 23 25 27
  node 1 size: 12093 MB
  node 1 free: 9406 MB
  node distances:
  node   0   1
    0:  10  20
    1:  20  10

This patch changes HEADER_NRCPUS.nr_cpus_available from _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF
to max_present_cpu and updates any user of cpu_topology_map to iterate
with nr_cpus_avail.

As a consequence HEADER_CPU_TOPOLOGY core_id and socket_id lists get longer,
but maintain compatibility with pre-patch state - index to cpu_topology_map is
CPU id.
