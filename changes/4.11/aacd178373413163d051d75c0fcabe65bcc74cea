staging: android: ion: return -ENOMEM in ion_cma_heap allocation failure

Initial Commit 349c9e138551 ("gpu: ion: add CMA heap") returns -1 in allocation
failure. The returned value is passed up to userspace through ioctl. So user can
misunderstand error reason as -EPERM(1) rather than -ENOMEM(12).

This patch simply changed this to return -ENOMEM.
