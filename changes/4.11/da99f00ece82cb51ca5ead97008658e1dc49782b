openrisc: head: Move init strings to rodata section

The strings used during the head/init phase of openrisc bootup were
stored in the executable section of the binary.

This causes compilation to fail when using CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO with
error:
 Error: unaligned opcodes detected in executable segment
