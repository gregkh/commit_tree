fs: Better permission checking for submounts

To support unprivileged users mounting filesystems two permission
checks have to be performed: a test to see if the user allowed to
create a mount in the mount namespace, and a test to see if
the user is allowed to access the specified filesystem.

The automount case is special in that mounting the original filesystem
grants permission to mount the sub-filesystems, to any user who
happens to stumble across the their mountpoint and satisfies the
ordinary filesystem permission checks.

Attempting to handle the automount case by using override_creds
almost works.  It preserves the idea that permission to mount
the original filesystem is permission to mount the sub-filesystem.
Unfortunately using override_creds messes up the filesystems
ordinary permission checks.

Solve this by being explicit that a mount is a submount by introducing
vfs_submount, and using it where appropriate.

vfs_submount uses a new mount internal mount flags MS_SUBMOUNT, to let
sget and friends know that a mount is a submount so they can take appropriate
action.

sget and sget_userns are modified to not perform any permission checks
on submounts.

follow_automount is modified to stop using override_creds as that
has proven problemantic.

do_mount is modified to always remove the new MS_SUBMOUNT flag so
that we know userspace will never by able to specify it.

autofs4 is modified to stop using current_real_cred that was put in
there to handle the previous version of submount permission checking.

cifs is modified to pass the mountpoint all of the way down to vfs_submount.

debugfs is modified to pass the mountpoint all of the way down to
trace_automount by adding a new parameter.  To make this change easier
a new typedef debugfs_automount_t is introduced to capture the type of
the debugfs automount function.
