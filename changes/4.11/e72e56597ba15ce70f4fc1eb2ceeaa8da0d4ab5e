i40e/i40evf: Moves skb from i40e_rx_buffer to i40e_ring

This patch reduces the size of struct i40e_rx_buffer by one pointer,
and makes the i40e driver a little more consistent with the igb driver
in terms of packets that span buffers.

We do this by moving the skb field from struct i40e_rx_buffer to
struct i40e_ring. We pass the skb we already have (or NULL if we
don't) to i40e_fetch_rx_buffer(), which skips the skb allocation if we
already have one for this packet.
