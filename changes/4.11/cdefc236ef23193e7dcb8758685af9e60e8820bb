staging: lustre: lnet: fix type warning in lib-socket.c

The local socket address is defined as a __be32 value.  However, if the
local ip address is not given, then the constant INADDR_ANY is used.

This patch converts INADDR_ANY to __be32 for type consistency.

Fixes the following sparse warnings:

drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/lib-socket.c:396:41: warning:
 incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/lib-socket.c:397:56: warning:
 restricted __be32 degrades to integer
