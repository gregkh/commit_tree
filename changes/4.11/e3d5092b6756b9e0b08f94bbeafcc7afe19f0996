ACPI: ioapic: Clear on-stack resource before using it

The on-stack resource-window 'win' in setup_res() is not
properly initialized. This causes the pointers in the
embedded 'struct resource' to contain stale addresses.

These pointers (in my case the ->child pointer) later get
propagated to the global iomem_resources list, causing a #GP
exception when the list is traversed in
iomem_map_sanity_check().
