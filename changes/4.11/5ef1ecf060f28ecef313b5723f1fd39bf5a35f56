mmc: sdio: fix alignment issue in struct sdio_func

Certain 64-bit systems (e.g. Amlogic Meson GX) require buffers to be
used for DMA to be 8-byte-aligned. struct sdio_func has an embedded
small DMA buffer not meeting this requirement.
When testing switching to descriptor chain mode in meson-gx driver
SDIO is broken therefore. Fix this by allocating the small DMA buffer
separately as kmalloc ensures that the returned memory area is
properly aligned for every basic data type.
