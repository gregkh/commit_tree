powerpc/pseries: Don't give a warning when HPT resizing isn't available

As of commit 438cc81a41e8 ("powerpc/pseries: Automatically resize HPT
for memory hot add/remove"), when running on the pseries platform, we
always attempt to use the PAPR extension to resize the hashed page
table (HPT) when we add or remove memory.

This is fine, but when the extension is not available we'll give a
harmless, but scary warning. Instead check if the firmware supports HPT
resizing before populating the mmu_hash_ops.resize_hpt pointer.
