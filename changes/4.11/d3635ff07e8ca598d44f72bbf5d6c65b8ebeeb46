nfsd: fix configuration of supported minor versions

When the user turns off all minor versions of NFSv4, that should be
equivalent to turning off NFSv4 support, so a mount attempt using NFSv4
should get RPC_PROG_MISMATCH, not NFSERR_MINOR_VERS_MISMATCH.

Allow the user to use either '4.0' or '4' to enable or disable minor
version 0.  Other minor versions are still enabled or disabled using the
'4.x' format.
