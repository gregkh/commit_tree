tty: pl011: fix earlycon work-around for QDF2400 erratum 44

The work-around for the Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies QDF2400
erratum 44 sets the "qdf2400_e44_present" global variable if the
work-around is needed.  However, this check does not happen until after
earlycon is initialized, which means the work-around is not
used, and the console hangs as soon as it displays one character.
