srcu: Force full grace-period ordering

If a process invokes synchronize_srcu(), is delayed just the right amount
of time, and thus does not sleep when waiting for the grace period to
complete, there is no ordering between the end of the grace period and
the code following the synchronize_srcu().  Similarly, there can be a
lack of ordering between the end of the SRCU grace period and callback
invocation.

This commit adds the necessary ordering.
