jump_label: Fix anonymous union initialization

Pre-4.6 gcc do not allow direct static initialization of members of
anonymous structs/unions. After commit 3821fd35b58d ("jump_label:
Reduce the size of struct static_key") STATIC_KEY_INIT_{TRUE|FALSE}
definitions cannot be compiled with those older compilers.

Placing initializers inside curved brackets works around this problem.
