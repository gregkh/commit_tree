arm: kprobes: Allow to handle reentered kprobe on single-stepping

This is arm port of commit 6a5022a56ac3 ("kprobes/x86: Allow to
handle reentered kprobe on single-stepping")

Since the FIQ handlers can interrupt in the single stepping
(or preparing the single stepping, do_debug etc.), we should
consider a kprobe is hit in the NMI handler. Even in that
case, the kprobe is allowed to be reentered as same as the
kprobes hit in kprobe handlers
(KPROBE_HIT_ACTIVE or KPROBE_HIT_SSDONE).

The real issue will happen when a kprobe hit while another
reentered kprobe is processing (KPROBE_REENTER), because
we already consumed a saved-area for the previous kprobe.
