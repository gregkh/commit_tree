lib: Introduce priority array area manager

This introduces a infrastructure for management of linear priority
areas. Priority order in an array matters, however order of items inside
a priority group does not matter.

As an initial implementation, L-sort algorithm is used. It is quite
trivial. More advanced algorithm called P-sort will be introduced as a
follow-up. The infrastructure is prepared for other algos.

Alongside this, a testing module is introduced as well.
