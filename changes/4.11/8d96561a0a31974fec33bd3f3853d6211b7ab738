drm/i915: Protect dev_priv->atomic_cdclk_freq with all the crtc locks

A modeset on one pipe can update dev_priv->atomic_cdclk_freq without
actually touching the hardware, in which case we won't force a modeset
on all the pipes, and thus won't lock any of the other pipes either.
That means a parallel plane update on another pipe could be looking at
a stale dev_priv->atomic_cdcdlk_freq and thus fail to notice when the
plane configuration is invalid, or potentially reject a valid update.

To overcome this we must protect writes to atomic_cdclk_freq with
all the crtc locks, and thus for reads any single crtc lock will
be sufficient protection.
