IB/ipoib: Change list_del to list_del_init in the tx object

Since ipoib_cm_tx_start function and ipoib_cm_tx_reap function
belong to different work queues, they can run in parallel.
In this case if ipoib_cm_tx_reap calls list_del and release the
lock, ipoib_cm_tx_start may acquire it and call list_del_init
on the already deleted object.
Changing list_del to list_del_init in ipoib_cm_tx_reap fixes the problem.
