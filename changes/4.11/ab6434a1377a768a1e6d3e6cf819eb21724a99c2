audit: move audit_signal_info() into kernel/auditsc.c

Commit 5b52330bbfe6 ("audit: fix auditd/kernel connection state
tracking") made inlining audit_signal_info() a bit pointless as
it was always calling into auditd_test_task() so let's remove the
inline function in kernel/audit.h and convert __audit_signal_info()
in kernel/auditsc.c into audit_signal_info().
