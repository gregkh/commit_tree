mmc: core: Move public functions from core.h to private headers

A significant amount of functions are available through the public mmc
core.h header file. Let's slim down this public mmc interface, as to
prevent users from abusing it, by moving some of the functions to private
mmc header files.

This change concentrates on moving the functions into private mmc headers,
following changes may continue with additional clean-ups, as an example
some functions can be turned into static.
