exec: Don't reset euid and egid when the tracee has CAP_SETUID

Don't reset euid and egid when the tracee has CAP_SETUID in
it's user namespace.  I punted on relaxing this permission check
long ago but now that I have read this code closely it is clear
it is safe to test against CAP_SETUID in the user namespace.
