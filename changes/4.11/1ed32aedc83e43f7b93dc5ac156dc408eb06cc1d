staging: lustre: llite: Remove access of stripe in ll_setattr_raw

In ll_setattr_raw(), it needs to know if a file is released
when the file is being truncated. It used to get this information
by accessing lov_stripe_md. This turns out not necessary. This
patch removes the access of lov_stripe_md and solves the problem
in lov_io_init_released().
