arm64: dts: mt8173: Fix cpu_thermal cooling-maps contributions

According to [0], the contribution field for each cooling-device express
their relative power efficiency. Higher weights express higher power
efficiency.  Weighting is relative such that if each cooling device has a
weight of 1 they are considered equal. This is particularly useful in
heterogeneous systems where two cooling devices may perform the same kind
of compute, but with different efficiency.

[0] Documentation/thermal/power_allocator.txt

According to Mediatek IC designer, the power efficiency ratio between the
LITTLE core cluster (cooling-device cpu0) and big core cluster
(cooling-device cpu1) is around 3:1 (3072:1024).
