xen/pvh: Bootstrap PVH guest

Start PVH guest at XEN_ELFNOTE_PHYS32_ENTRY address. Setup hypercall
page, initialize boot_params, enable early page tables.

Since this stub is executed before kernel entry point we cannot use
variables in .bss which is cleared by kernel. We explicitly place
variables that are initialized here into .data.

While adjusting xen_hvm_init_shared_info() make it use cpuid_e?x()
instead of cpuid() (wherever possible).
