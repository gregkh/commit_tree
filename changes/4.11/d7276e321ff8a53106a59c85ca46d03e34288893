seccomp: Only dump core when single-threaded

The SECCOMP_RET_KILL filter return code has always killed the current
thread, not the entire process. Changing this as a side-effect of dumping
core isn't a safe thing to do (a few test suites have already flagged this
behavioral change). Instead, restore the RET_KILL semantics, but still
dump core when a RET_KILL delivers SIGSYS to a single-threaded process.
