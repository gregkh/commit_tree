mm, thp: add new defer+madvise defrag option

There is no thp defrag option that currently allows MADV_HUGEPAGE
regions to do direct compaction and reclaim while all other thp
allocations simply trigger kswapd and kcompactd in the background and
fail immediately.

The "defer" setting simply triggers background reclaim and compaction
for all regions, regardless of MADV_HUGEPAGE, which makes it unusable
for our userspace where MADV_HUGEPAGE is being used to indicate the
application is willing to wait for work for thp memory to be available.

The "madvise" setting will do direct compaction and reclaim for these
MADV_HUGEPAGE regions, but does not trigger kswapd and kcompactd in the
background for anybody else.

For reasonable usage, there needs to be a mesh between the two options.
This patch introduces a fifth mode, "defer+madvise", that will do direct
reclaim and compaction for MADV_HUGEPAGE regions and trigger background
reclaim and compaction for everybody else so that hugepages may be
available in the near future.

A proposal to allow direct reclaim and compaction for MADV_HUGEPAGE
regions as part of the "defer" mode, making it a very powerful setting
and avoids breaking userspace, was offered:
     http://marc.info/?t=148236612700003
This additional mode is a compromise.

A second proposal to allow both "defer" and "madvise" to be selected at
the same time was also offered:
     http://marc.info/?t=148357345300001.
This is possible, but there was a concern that it might break existing
userspaces the parse the output of the defrag mode, so the fifth option
was introduced instead.

This patch also cleans up the helper function for storing to "enabled"
and "defrag" since the former supports three modes while the latter
supports five and triple_flag_store() was getting unnecessarily messy.
