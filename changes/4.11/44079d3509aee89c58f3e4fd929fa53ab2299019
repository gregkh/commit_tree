MIPS: Use Makefile.postlink to insert relocations into vmlinux

When relocatable support for MIPS was merged, there was no support for
an architecture to add a postlink step for vmlinux. This meant that only
invoking a target within the boot directory, such as uImage, caused the
relocations to be inserted into vmlinux. Building just the vmlinux
target would result in a relocatable kernel with no relocation
information present.

Commit fbe6e37dab97 ("kbuild: add arch specific post-link Makefile")
recified this situation, so MIPS can now define a postlink step to add
relocation information into vmlinux, and remove the additional steps
tacked onto boot targets.
