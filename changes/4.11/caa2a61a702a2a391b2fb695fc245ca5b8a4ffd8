ALSA: x86: Remove superfluous check at resume

The had_get_hwstate() is identical with drv_status==DISCONECTED, which
was already checked before the call.  And, returning an error at
resume is simply bad.  That is, we should just kill this check.

Also, spewing an error at resume for drv_status!=SUSPENDED is also
annoying, as this is the normal case when the suspend was called
without the monitor connection.  Make it debug, too.
