ALSA: bebob: enclose identifiers referred by single function

Some identifiers are referred just by one functions. In this case, they
can be put into the function definition. This brings two merits; readers
can easily follow codes related to the identifiers, developers are free
from name conflict.

This commit moves such identifiers to each function definition.
