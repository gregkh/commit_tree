ipv4: fib: Add events for FIB replace and append

The FIB notification chain currently uses the NLM_F_{REPLACE,APPEND}
flags to signal routes being replaced or appended.

Instead of using netlink flags for in-kernel notifications we can simply
introduce two new events in the FIB notification chain. This has the
added advantage of making the API cleaner, thereby making it clear that
these events should be supported by listeners of the notification chain.
