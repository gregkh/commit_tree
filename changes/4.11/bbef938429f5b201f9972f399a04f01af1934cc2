mm: vmscan: remove old flusher wakeup from direct reclaim path

Direct reclaim has been replaced by kswapd reclaim in pretty much all
common memory pressure situations, so this code most likely doesn't
accomplish the described effect anymore.  The previous patch wakes up
flushers for all reclaimers when we encounter dirty pages at the tail
end of the LRU.  Remove the crufty old direct reclaim invocation.
