ipc/sem: add hysteresis

sysv sem has two lock modes: One with per-semaphore locks, one lock mode
with a single global lock for the whole array.  When switching from the
per-semaphore locks to the global lock, all per-semaphore locks must be
scanned for ongoing operations.

The patch adds a hysteresis for switching from the global lock to the
per semaphore locks.  This reduces how often the per-semaphore locks
must be scanned.

Compared to the initial patch, this is a simplified solution: Setting
USE_GLOBAL_LOCK_HYSTERESIS to 1 restores the current behavior.

In theory, a workload with exactly 10 simple sops and then one complex
op now scales a bit worse, but this is pure theory: If there is
concurrency, the it won't be exactly 10:1:10:1:10:1:...  If there is no
concurrency, then there is no need for scalability.
