atmel_serial: Use the fractional divider when possible

The fractional baud rate generator is available when using the
asynchronous mode of Atmel USART controllers. It makes it possible to
use higher baudrates, in exchange for a less precise clock with a
variable duty cycle.

The existing code restricts its use to the normal mode of the USART
controller, following the recommendation from the datasheet for the
first chip embedding this type of controller. This recommendation has
been removed from the documentation for the newer chips. After
verification, all revisions of this controller should be able to use the
fractional baud rate generator with the different asynchronous modes.

Removing the condition on ATMEL_US_USMODE makes it possible to get
correct baudrates at high speed in more cases.

This was tested with a board using an Atmel SAMA5D2 chip and a TI
WL1831 WiFi/Bluetooth combo chip at 3 Mbauds, with hardware flow control
enabled.
