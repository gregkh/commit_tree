block: Allow bdi re-registration

SCSI can call device_add_disk() several times for one request queue when
a device in unbound and bound, creating new gendisk each time. This will
lead to bdi being repeatedly registered and unregistered. This was not a
big problem until commit 165a5e22fafb "block: Move bdi_unregister() to
del_gendisk()" since bdi was only registered repeatedly (bdi_register()
handles repeated calls fine, only we ended up leaking reference to
gendisk due to overwriting bdi->owner) but unregistered only in
blk_cleanup_queue() which didn't get called repeatedly. After
165a5e22fafb we were doing correct bdi_register() - bdi_unregister()
cycles however bdi_unregister() is not prepared for it. So make sure
bdi_unregister() cleans up bdi in such a way that it is prepared for
a possible following bdi_register() call.

An easy way to provoke this behavior is to enable
CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and use scsi_debug driver to create a
scsi disk which immediately hangs without this fix.
