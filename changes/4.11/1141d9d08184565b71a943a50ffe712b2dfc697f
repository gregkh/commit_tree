clk: x86: Add Atom PMC platform clocks

The BayTrail and CherryTrail platforms provide platform clocks
through their Power Management Controller (PMC).

The SoC supports up to 6 clocks (PMC_PLT_CLK[0..5]) with a
frequency of either 19.2 MHz (PLL) or 25 MHz (XTAL) for BayTrail
and a frequency of 19.2 MHz (XTAL) for CherryTrail. These clocks
are available for general system use, where appropriate, and each
have Control & Frequency register fields associated with them.
