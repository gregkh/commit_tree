rtc: ds3232: Call device_init_wakeup before device_register

The wakealarm attribute is currently not exposed in the sysfs interface
as the device has not been set as doing wakealarm when device_register
is called. Changing the order of the calls fixes that problem. Interrupts
are cleared in check_rtc_status prior to requesting the interrupt.

This is only set if an irq is defined. If irq registration fails then
set wakeup_capable to false. With this change the sysfs wakealarm
attribute will be left visible but it is non functional. rtcwake
still returns that the device is not enabled for wakeup.
