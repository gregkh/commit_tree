drm/i915: Integrate i915_sw_fence with debugobjects

Add the tracking required to enable debugobjects for fences to improve
error detection in BAT. The debugobject interface lets us track the
lifetime and phases of the fences even while being embedded into larger
structs, i.e. to check they are not used after they have been released.

v2: Don't populate the stubs, debugobjects checks for a NULL pointer and
treats it equivalently.
