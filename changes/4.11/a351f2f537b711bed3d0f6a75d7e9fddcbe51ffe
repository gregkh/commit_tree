wil6210: support loading dedicated image for sparrow-plus devices

Driver may be used in platforms where some use sparrow cards while
other use sparrow-plus cards, where different FW image is needed.
Add the capability to load dedicated FW image in case sparrow-plus
card is detected and fallback to default image if such does not exist.
