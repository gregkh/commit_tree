block: optionally merge discontiguous discard bios into a single request

Add a new merge strategy that merges discard bios into a request until the
maximum number of discard ranges (or the maximum discard size) is reached
from the plug merging code.  I/O scheduler merging is not wired up yet
but might also be useful, although not for fast devices like NVMe which
are the only user for now.

Note that for now we don't support limiting the size of each discard range,
but if needed that can be added later.
