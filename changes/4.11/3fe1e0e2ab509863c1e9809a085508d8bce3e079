extcon: axp288: Simplify axp288_handle_chrg_det_event

axp288_handle_chrg_det_event only gets called on change interrupts
(so not that often), extcon_set_state_sync() checks itself if there are
any actual changes before notifying listeners, and gpiod_set_value is
not really expensive either.

So we can simply always do both on each interrupt removing a bunch of
somewhat magic looking code from axp288_handle_chrg_det_event.
