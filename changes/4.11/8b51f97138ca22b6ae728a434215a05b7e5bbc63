arm64: dts: r8a7796: Use R-Car Gen 3 fallback binding for msiof nodes

Use recently added R-Car Gen 3 fallback binding for msiof nodes in
DT for r8a7796 SoC.

This has no run-time effect for the current driver as the initialisation
sequence is the same for the SoC-specific binding for r8a7796 and the
fallback binding for R-Car Gen 3.
