sh: Don't set sh-sci pdata scscr TIE and RIE bits

The scscr platform data field is used by the driver in three locations.
One of them masks out all bits except SCSCR_REIE. The two other are the
set_termios handler and the console write handler.

The set_termios handler calls sci_start_rx() to enable the receiver,
which sets the RIE bit unconditionally. It then calls sci_port_disable()
that effectively disables both the transmitter and the receiver. The
TIE bit will thus get set later when the serial cores reenables the
serial port.

The console write handler runs with interrupts disabled, and saves and
restores the SCSCR register value. The RIE and TIE bits are thus not
needed there.

The bits are thus not necessary in platform data, remove them.
