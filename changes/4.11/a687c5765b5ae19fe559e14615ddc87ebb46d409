HID: sony: Fix input device leak when connecting a DS4 twice using USB/BT

When a user connects a DS4 twice using USB and BT, we reject the
second device connection after the setup work. We then perform
a cleanup, but during cleanup we are not removing the touchpad
device. This leads to leakage of an input device, which we would
never remove. It can likely result into a kernel oops as well
when the touchpad evdev node is accessed and the underlaying HID
device has been removed from the system.
