net/ena: change condition for host attribute configuration

Move the host info config to be the first admin command that is executed.
This change require the driver to remove the 'feature check'
from host info configuration flow.
The check is removed since the supported features bitmask field
is retrieved only after calling ENA_ADMIN_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES admin command.

If set host info is not supported an error will be returned by the device.
