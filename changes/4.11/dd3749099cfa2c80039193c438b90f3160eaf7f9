usb: chipidea: msm: Rely on core to override AHBBURST

The core framework already handles setting this parameter with a
platform quirk. Add the appropriate flag so that we always set
AHBBURST to 0. Technically DT should be doing this, but we always
do it for msm chipidea devices so setting the flag in the driver
works just as well. If the burst needs to be anything besides 0,
we expect the 'ahb-burst-config' dts property to be present.
