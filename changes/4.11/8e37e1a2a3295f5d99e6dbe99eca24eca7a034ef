cpuidle/menu: stop seeking deeper idle if current state is deep enough

Obsolete commit 71abbbf856a0 (cpuidle: extend cpuidle and menu governor
to handle dynamic states) wanted to introduce dynamic C-states, but that
idea was dropped long ago.  The nonsense deeper C-state checking
remained, though.

Since both target_residency and exit_latency are longer for deeper
idle state, there's no need to waste CPU time on useless checks.
