serial: sh-sci: Remove manual break debouncing

The sh-sci driver implements manual break debouncing for a few SH
platforms by reading the value of the RX pin port register. This feature
is optional and the driver considers all negative or zero values of the
platform data port_reg field as invalid. As the four platforms that set
the field to a register address all use an address higher than
0x7fffffff, the driver will always consider the value as invalid and
never perform debouncing. The feature is unused, remove it.

Debouncing could be implemented properly in the future using the pinctrl
and GPIO APIs if desired.
