PCI: thunder-pem: Add legacy firmware support for Cavium ThunderX host controller

During early days of PCI quirks support, ThunderX firmware did not provide
PNP0c02 node with PCI configuration space and PEM-specific register ranges.
This means that for legacy FW we are not reserving these resources and
cannot gather PEM-specific resources for further PEM initialization.

To support already deployed legacy FW, calculate PEM-specific ranges and
provide resources reservation as fallback scenario into PEM driver when we
could not gather PEM reg base from ACPI tables.
