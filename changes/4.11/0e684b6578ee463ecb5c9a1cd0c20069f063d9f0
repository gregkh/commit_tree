tracing: Reset parser->buffer to allow multiple "puts"

trace_parser_put() simply frees the allocated parser buffer. But it does not
reset the pointer that was freed. This means that if trace_parser_put() is
called on the same parser more than once, it will corrupt the allocation
system. Setting parser->buffer to NULL after free allows it to be called
more than once without any ill effect.
