rfkill: Add rfkill-any LED trigger

Add a new "global" (i.e. not per-rfkill device) LED trigger, rfkill-any,
which may be useful on laptops with a single "radio LED" and multiple
radio transmitters.  The trigger is meant to turn a LED on whenever
there is at least one radio transmitter active and turn it off
otherwise.

This requires taking rfkill_global_mutex before calling rfkill_set_block()
in rfkill_resume(): since __rfkill_any_led_trigger_event() is called from
rfkill_set_block() unconditionally, each caller of the latter needs to
take care of locking rfkill_global_mutex.
