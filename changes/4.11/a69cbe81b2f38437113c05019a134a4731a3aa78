KVM: s390: guestdbg: filter PER i-fetch on EXECUTE properly

When we get a PER i-fetch event on an EXECUTE or EXECUTE RELATIVE LONG
instruction, because the executed instruction generated a PER i-fetch
event, then the PER address points at the EXECUTE function, not the
fetched one.

Therefore, when filtering PER events, we have to take care of the
really fetched instruction, which we can only get by reading in guest
virtual memory.

For icpt code 4 and 56, we directly have additional information about an
EXECUTE instruction at hand. For icpt code 8, we always have to read
in guest virtual memory.
