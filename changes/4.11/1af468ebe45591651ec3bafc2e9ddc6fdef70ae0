mfd: axp20x: Fix axp288 PEK_DBR and PEK_DBF irqs being swapped

The R in PEK_DBR stands for rising, so it should be mapped to
AXP288_IRQ_POKP where the last P stands for positive edge.

Likewise PEK_DBF should be mapped to the falling edge, aka the
_N_egative edge, so it should be mapped to AXP288_IRQ_POKN.

This fixes the inverted powerbutton status reporting by the
axp20x-pek driver.
