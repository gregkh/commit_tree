usb: musb: dsps: Manage CPPI 4.1 DMA interrupt in DSPS

Despite the CPPI 4.1 is a generic DMA, it is tied to USB.
On the DSPS, CPPI 4.1 interrupt's registers are in USBSS (the MUSB glue).
Currently, to enable / disable and clear interrupts, the CPPI 4.1 driver
maps and accesses to USBSS's register, which making CPPI 4.1 driver not
really generic.
Move the interrupt management to DSPS driver.
