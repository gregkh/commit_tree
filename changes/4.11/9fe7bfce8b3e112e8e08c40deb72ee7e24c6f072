virtio_net: refactor freeze/restore logic into virtnet reset logic

For XDP we will need to reset the queues to allow for buffer headroom
to be configured. In order to do this we need to essentially run the
freeze()/restore() code path. Unfortunately the locking requirements
between the freeze/restore and reset paths are different however so
we can not simply reuse the code.

This patch refactors the code path and adds a reset helper routine.
