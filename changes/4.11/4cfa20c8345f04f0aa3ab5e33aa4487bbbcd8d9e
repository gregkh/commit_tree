drm/i915: allow GEM_BUG_ON expr checking with !DEBUG_GEM

Use BUILD_BUG_ON_INVALID(expr) in GEM_BUG_ON when building without
DEBUG_GEM. This means the compiler can now check the validity of expr
without generating any code, in turn preventing us from inadvertently
breaking the build when DEBUG_GEM is not enabled.
