[media] coda: support YUYV output if VDOA is used

The VDOA is able to transform the NV12 custom macroblock tiled format of
the CODA to YUYV format. If and only if the VDOA is available, the
driver can also provide YUYV support.

While the driver is configured to produce YUYV output, the CODA must be
configured to produce NV12 macroblock tiled frames and the VDOA must
transform the intermediate result into the final YUYV output.
