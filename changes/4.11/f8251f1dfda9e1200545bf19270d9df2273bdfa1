i2c: mux: pca954x: Add missing pca9542 definition to chip_desc

The spec for the pca954x was missing. This chip is the same as the pca9540
except that it has interrupt lines. While the i2c_device_id table mapped
the pca9542 to the pca9540 definition the compatible table did not. In
preparation for irq support add the pca9542 definition.
