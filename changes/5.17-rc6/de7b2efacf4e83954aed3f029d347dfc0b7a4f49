udp_tunnel: Fix end of loop test in udp_tunnel_nic_unregister()

This test is checking if we exited the list via break or not.  However
if it did not exit via a break then "node" does not point to a valid
udp_tunnel_nic_shared_node struct.  It will work because of the way
the structs are laid out it's the equivalent of
"if (info->shared->udp_tunnel_nic_info != dev)" which will always be
true, but it's not the right way to test.
