netfilter: nf_tables_offload: incorrect flow offload action array size

immediate verdict expression needs to allocate one slot in the flow offload
action array, however, immediate data expression does not need to do so.

fwd and dup expression need to allocate one slot, this is missing.

Add a new offload_action interface to report if this expression needs to
allocate one slot in the flow offload action array.
