bnxt_en: Fix devlink fw_activate

To install a livepatch, first flash the package to NVM, and then
activate the patch through the "HWRM_FW_LIVEPATCH" fw command.
To uninstall a patch from NVM, flash the removal package and then
activate it through the "HWRM_FW_LIVEPATCH" fw command.

The "HWRM_FW_LIVEPATCH" fw command has to consider following scenarios:

1. no patch in NVM and no patch active. Do nothing.
2. patch in NVM, but not active. Activate the patch currently in NVM.
3. patch is not in NVM, but active. Deactivate the patch.
4. patch in NVM and the patch active. Do nothing.

Fix the code to handle these scenarios during devlink "fw_activate".

To install and activate a live patch:
devlink dev flash pci/0000:c1:00.0 file thor_patch.pkg
devlink -f dev reload pci/0000:c1:00.0 action fw_activate limit no_reset

To remove and deactivate a live patch:
devlink dev flash pci/0000:c1:00.0 file thor_patch_rem.pkg
devlink -f dev reload pci/0000:c1:00.0 action fw_activate limit no_reset
