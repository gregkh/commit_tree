mm: fix use-after-free bug when mm->mmap is reused after being freed

oom reaping (__oom_reap_task_mm) relies on a 2 way synchronization with
exit_mmap.  First it relies on the mmap_lock to exclude from unlock
path[1], page tables tear down (free_pgtables) and vma destruction.
This alone is not sufficient because mm->mmap is never reset.

For historical reasons[2] the lock is taken there is also MMF_OOM_SKIP
set for oom victims before.

The oom reaper only ever looks at oom victims so the whole scheme works
properly but process_mrelease can opearate on any task (with fatal
signals pending) which doesn't really imply oom victims.  That means
that the MMF_OOM_SKIP part of the synchronization doesn't work and it
can see a task after the whole address space has been demolished and
traverse an already released mm->mmap list.  This leads to use after
free as properly caught up by KASAN report.

Fix the issue by reseting mm->mmap so that MMF_OOM_SKIP synchronization
is not needed anymore.  The MMF_OOM_SKIP is not removed from exit_mmap
yet but it acts mostly as an optimization now.
