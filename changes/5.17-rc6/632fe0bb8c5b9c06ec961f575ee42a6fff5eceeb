iio: Fix error handling for PM

The pm_runtime_enable will increase power disable depth.
If the probe fails, we should use pm_runtime_disable() to balance
pm_runtime_enable(). In the PM Runtime docs:
    Drivers in ->remove() callback should undo the runtime PM changes done
    in ->probe(). Usually this means calling pm_runtime_disable(),
    pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() etc.
We should do this in error handling.

Fix this problem for the following drivers: bmc150, bmg160, kmx61,
kxcj-1013, mma9551, mma9553.
