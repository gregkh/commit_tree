ftrace: Remove unused ftrace_startup_enable() stub

When building with clang + CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=n + W=1, there is a
warning:

  kernel/trace/ftrace.c:7194:20: error: unused function 'ftrace_startup_enable' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
  static inline void ftrace_startup_enable(int command) { }
                     ^
  1 error generated.

Clang warns on instances of static inline functions in .c files with W=1
after commit 6863f5643dd7 ("kbuild: allow Clang to find unused static
inline functions for W=1 build").

The ftrace_startup_enable() stub has been unused since
commit e1effa0144a1 ("ftrace: Annotate the ops operation on update"),
where its use outside of the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_TRACE section was replaced
by ftrace_startup_all().  Remove it to resolve the warning.
