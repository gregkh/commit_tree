gpu: host1x: Fix hang on Tegra186+

Tegra186+ hangs if host1x hardware is disabled at a kernel boot time
because we touch hardware before runtime PM is resumed. Move sync point
assignment initialization to the RPM-resume callback. Older SoCs were
unaffected because they skip that sync point initialization.
