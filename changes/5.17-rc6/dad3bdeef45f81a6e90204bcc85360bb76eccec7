netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj update

stateful objects can be updated from the control plane.
The transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.

The ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaks
resources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.

nft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,
but the update path doesn't increment it.

To avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get for
the update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().
