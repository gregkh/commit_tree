KVM: Fix lockdep false negative during host resume

I saw the below splatting after the host suspended and resumed.

lockdep_is_held() can return -1 when lockdep is disabled which triggers
this warning. Let's use lockdep_assert_not_held() which can detect
incorrect calls while holding a lock and it also avoids false negatives
when lockdep is disabled.
