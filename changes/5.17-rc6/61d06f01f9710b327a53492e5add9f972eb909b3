selftests: bpf: Check bpf_msg_push_data return value

bpf_msg_push_data may return a non-zero value to indicate an error. The
return value should be checked to prevent undetected errors.

To indicate an error, the BPF programs now perform a different action
than their intended one to make the userspace test program notice the
error, i.e., the programs supposed to pass/redirect drop, the program
supposed to drop passes.
