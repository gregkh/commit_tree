surface: surface3_power: Fix battery readings on batteries without a serial number

The battery on the 2nd hand Surface 3 which I recently bought appears to
not have a serial number programmed in. This results in any I2C reads from
the registers containing the serial number failing with an I2C NACK.

This was causing mshw0011_bix() to fail causing the battery readings to
not work at all.

Ignore EREMOTEIO (I2C NACK) errors when retrieving the serial number and
continue with an empty serial number to fix this.
