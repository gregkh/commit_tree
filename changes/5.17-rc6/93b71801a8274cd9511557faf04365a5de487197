KVM: PPC: reserve capability 210 for KVM_CAP_PPC_AIL_MODE_3

Add KVM_CAP_PPC_AIL_MODE_3 to advertise the capability to set the AIL
resource mode to 3 with the H_SET_MODE hypercall. This capability
differs between processor types and KVM types (PR, HV, Nested HV), and
affects guest-visible behaviour.

QEMU will implement a cap-ail-mode-3 to control this behaviour[1], and
use the KVM CAP if available to determine KVM support[2].
