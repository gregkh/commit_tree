cpufreq: Reintroduce ready() callback

This effectively revert '4bf8e582119e ("cpufreq: Remove ready()
callback")', in order to reintroduce the ready callback.

This is needed in order to be able to leave the thermal pressure
interrupts in the Qualcomm CPUfreq driver disabled during
initialization, so that it doesn't fire while related_cpus are still 0.
