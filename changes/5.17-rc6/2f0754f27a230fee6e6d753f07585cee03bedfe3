clk: jz4725b: fix mmc0 clock gating

The mmc0 clock gate bit was mistakenly assigned to "i2s" clock.
You can find that the same bit is assigned to "mmc0" too.
It leads to mmc0 hang for a long time after any sound activity
also it  prevented PM_SLEEP to work properly.
I guess it was introduced by copy-paste from jz4740 driver
where it is really controls I2S clock gate.
