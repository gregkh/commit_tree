nvme-tcp: send H2CData PDUs based on MAXH2CDATA

As per NVMe/TCP specification (revision 1.0a, section 3.6.2.3)
Maximum Host to Controller Data length (MAXH2CDATA): Specifies the
maximum number of PDU-Data bytes per H2CData PDU in bytes. This value
is a multiple of dwords and should be no less than 4,096.

Current code sets H2CData PDU data_length to r2t_length,
it does not check MAXH2CDATA value. Fix this by setting H2CData PDU
data_length to min(req->h2cdata_left, queue->maxh2cdata).

Also validate MAXH2CDATA value returned by target in ICResp PDU,
if it is not a multiple of dword or if it is less than 4096 return
-EINVAL from nvme_tcp_init_connection().
