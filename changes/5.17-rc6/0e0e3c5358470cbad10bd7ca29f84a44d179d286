bnxt_en: Restore the resets_reliable flag in bnxt_open()

During ifdown, we call bnxt_inv_fw_health_reg() which will clear
both the status_reliable and resets_reliable flags if these
registers are mapped.  This is correct because a FW reset during
ifdown will clear these register mappings.  If we detect that FW
has gone through reset during the next ifup, we will remap these
registers.

But during normal ifup with no FW reset, we need to restore the
resets_reliable flag otherwise we will not show the reset counter
during devlink diagnose.
