selftests/memfd: clean up mapping in mfd_fail_write

Running the memfd script ./run_hugetlbfs_test.sh will often end in error
as follows:

    memfd-hugetlb: CREATE
    memfd-hugetlb: BASIC
    memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-WRITE
    memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-FUTURE-WRITE
    memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-SHRINK
    fallocate(ALLOC) failed: No space left on device
    ./run_hugetlbfs_test.sh: line 60: 166855 Aborted                 (core dumped) ./memfd_test hugetlbfs
    opening: ./mnt/memfd
    fuse: DONE

If no hugetlb pages have been preallocated, run_hugetlbfs_test.sh will
allocate 'just enough' pages to run the test.  In the SEAL-FUTURE-WRITE
test the mfd_fail_write routine maps the file, but does not unmap.  As a
result, two hugetlb pages remain reserved for the mapping.  When the
fallocate call in the SEAL-SHRINK test attempts allocate all hugetlb
pages, it is short by the two reserved pages.

Fix by making sure to unmap in mfd_fail_write.
