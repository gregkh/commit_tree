IB/qib: Fix duplicate sysfs directory name

The qib driver load has been failing with the following message:

  sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/pci0000:80/0000:80:02.0/0000:81:00.0/infiniband/qib0/ports/1/linkcontrol'

The patch below has two "linkcontrol" names causing the duplication.

Fix by using the correct "diag_counters" name on the second instance.
