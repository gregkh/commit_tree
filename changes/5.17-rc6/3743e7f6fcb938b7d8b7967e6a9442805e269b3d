drm/amd/display: Fix stream->link_enc unassigned during stream removal

[Why]
Found when running igt@kms_atomic.

Userspace attempts to do a TEST_COMMIT when 0 streams which calls
dc_remove_stream_from_ctx. This in turn calls link_enc_unassign
which ends up modifying stream->link = NULL directly, causing the
global link_enc to be removed preventing further link activity
and future link validation from passing.

[How]
We take care of link_enc unassignment at the start of
link_enc_cfg_link_encs_assign so this call is no longer necessary.

Fixes global state from being modified while unlocked.
