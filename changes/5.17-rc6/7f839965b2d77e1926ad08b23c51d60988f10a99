net/mlx5: Update log_max_qp value to be 17 at most

Currently, log_max_qp value is dependent on what FW reports as its max capability.
In reality, due to a bug, some FWs report a value greater than 17, even though they
don't support log_max_qp > 17.

This FW issue led the driver to exhaust memory on startup.
Thus, log_max_qp value is set to be no more than 17 regardless
of what FW reports, as it was before the cited commit.
