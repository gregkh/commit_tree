Drivers: hv: copy from message page only what's needed

Hyper-V Interrupt Message Page (SIMP) has 16 256-byte slots for
messages. Each message comes with a header (16 bytes) which specifies the
payload length (up to 240 bytes). vmbus_on_msg_dpc(), however, doesn't
look at the real message length and copies the whole slot to a temporary
buffer before passing it to message handlers. This is potentially dangerous
as hypervisor doesn't have to clean the whole slot when putting a new
message there and a message handler can get access to some data which
belongs to a previous message.

Note, this is not currently a problem because all message handlers are
in-kernel but eventually we may e.g. get this exported to userspace.

Note also, that this is not a performance critical path: messages (unlike
events) represent rare events so it doesn't really matter (from performance
point of view) if we copy too much.

Fix the issue by taking into account the real message length. The temporary
buffer allocated by vmbus_on_msg_dpc() remains fixed size for now. Also,
check that the supplied payload length is valid (<= 240 bytes).
