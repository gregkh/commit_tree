libbpf: Support pre-initializing .bss global variables

Remove invalid assumption in libbpf that .bss map doesn't have to be updated
in kernel. With addition of skeleton and memory-mapped initialization image,
.bss doesn't have to be all zeroes when BPF map is created, because user-code
might have initialized those variables from user-space.
