spi: dw: Return any value retrieved from the dma_transfer callback

DW APB SSI DMA-part of the driver may need to perform the requested
SPI-transfer synchronously. In that case the dma_transfer() callback
will return 0 as a marker of the SPI transfer being finished so the
SPI core doesn't need to wait and may proceed with the SPI message
trasnfers pumping procedure. This will be needed to fix the problem
when DMA transactions are finished, but there is still data left in
the SPI Tx/Rx FIFOs being sent/received. But for now make dma_transfer
to return 1 as the normal dw_spi_transfer_one() method.
