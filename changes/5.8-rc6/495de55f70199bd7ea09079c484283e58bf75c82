net: netsec: Add support for XDP frame size

This driver takes advantage of page_pool PP_FLAG_DMA_SYNC_DEV that
can help reduce the number of cache-lines that need to be flushed
when doing DMA sync for_device. Due to xdp_adjust_tail can grow the
area accessible to the by the CPU (can possibly write into), then max
sync length *after* bpf_prog_run_xdp() needs to be taken into account.

For XDP_TX action the driver is smart and does DMA-sync. When growing
tail this is still safe, because page_pool have DMA-mapped the entire
page size.
