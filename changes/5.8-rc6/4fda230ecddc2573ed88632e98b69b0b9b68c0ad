iommu/vt-d: Allocate domain info for real DMA sub-devices

Sub-devices of a real DMA device might exist on a separate segment than
the real DMA device and its IOMMU. These devices should still have a
valid device_domain_info, but the current dma alias model won't
allocate info for the subdevice.

This patch adds a segment member to struct device_domain_info and uses
the sub-device's BDF so that these sub-devices won't alias to other
devices.
