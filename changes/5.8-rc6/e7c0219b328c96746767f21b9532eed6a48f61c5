objtool: Fix !CFI insn_state propagation

Objtool keeps per instruction CFI state in struct insn_state and will
save/restore this where required. However, insn_state has grown some
!CFI state, and this must not be saved/restored (that would
loose/destroy state).

Fix this by moving the CFI specific parts of insn_state into struct
cfi_state.
