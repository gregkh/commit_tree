bpf: Allocate ID for bpf_link

Generate ID for each bpf_link using IDR, similarly to bpf_map and bpf_prog.
bpf_link creation, initialization, attachment, and exposing to user-space
through FD and ID is a complicated multi-step process, abstract it away
through bpf_link_primer and bpf_link_prime(), bpf_link_settle(), and
bpf_link_cleanup() internal API. They guarantee that until bpf_link is
properly attached, user-space won't be able to access partially-initialized
bpf_link either from FD or ID. All this allows to simplify bpf_link attachment
and error handling code.
