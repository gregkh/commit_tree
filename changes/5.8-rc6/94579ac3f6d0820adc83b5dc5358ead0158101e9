xfrm: Fix double ESP trailer insertion in IPsec crypto offload.

During IPsec performance testing, we see bad ICMP checksum. The error packet
has duplicated ESP trailer due to double validate_xmit_xfrm calls. The first call
is from ip_output, but the packet cannot be sent because
netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped is true and the packet gets dev_requeue_skb. The second
call is from NET_TX softirq. However after the first call, the packet already
has the ESP trailer.

Fix by marking the skb with XFRM_XMIT bit after the packet is handled by
validate_xmit_xfrm to avoid duplicate ESP trailer insertion.
