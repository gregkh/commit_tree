pinctrl: freescale: imx: Fix an error handling path in 'imx_pinctrl_probe()'

'pinctrl_unregister()' should not be called to undo
'devm_pinctrl_register_and_init()', it is already handled by the framework.

This simplifies the error handling paths of the probe function.
The 'imx_free_resources()' can be removed as well.

Fixes: a51c158bf0f7 ("pinctrl: imx: use radix trees for groups and functions")
