mmc: sdhci-msm: Clear tuning done flag while hs400 tuning

Clear tuning_done flag while executing tuning to ensure vendor
specific HS400 settings are applied properly when the controller
is re-initialized in HS400 mode.

Without this, re-initialization of the qcom SDHC in HS400 mode fails
while resuming the driver from runtime-suspend or system-suspend.
