tools: bpftool: For "feature probe" define "full_mode" bool as global

The "full_mode" variable used for switching between full or partial
feature probing (i.e. with or without probing helpers that will log
warnings in kernel logs) was piped from the main do_probe() function
down to probe_helpers_for_progtype(), where it is needed.

Define it as a global variable: the calls will be more readable, and if
other similar flags were to be used in the future, we could use global
variables as well instead of extending again the list of arguments with
new flags.
