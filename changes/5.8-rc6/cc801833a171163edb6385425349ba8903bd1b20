x86/ldt: Disable 16-bit segments on Xen PV

Xen PV doesn't implement ESPFIX64, so they don't work right.  Disable
them.  Also print a warning the first time anyone tries to use a
16-bit segment on a Xen PV guest that would otherwise allow it
to help people diagnose this change in behavior.

This gets us closer to having all x86 selftests pass on Xen PV.
