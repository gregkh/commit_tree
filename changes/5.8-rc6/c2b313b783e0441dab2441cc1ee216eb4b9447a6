ice: fix kernel BUG if register_netdev fails

If register_netdev() fails, the driver will attempt to cleanup the
q_vectors and inadvertently trigger a kernel BUG due to a NULL pointer
dereference.

This occurs because cleaning up q_vectors attempts to call
netif_napi_del on napi_structs which were never initialized.

Resolve this by releasing the netdev in ice_cfg_netdev and setting
vsi->netdev to NULL. This ensures that after ice_cfg_netdev fails the
state is rewound to match as if ice_cfg_netdev was never called.
