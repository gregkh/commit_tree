btrfs: reloc: use wrapper to replace open-coded edge linking

Since backref_edge is used to connect upper and lower backref nodes, and
needs to access both nodes, some code can look pretty nasty:

		list_add_tail(&edge->list[LOWER], &cur->upper);

The above code will link @cur to the LOWER side of the edge, while both
"LOWER" and "upper" words show up.  This can sometimes be very confusing
for reader to grasp.

This patch introduces a new wrapper, link_backref_edge(), to handle the
linking behavior.  Which also has extra ASSERT() to ensure caller won't
pass wrong nodes.

Also, this updates the comment of related lists of backref_node and
backref_edge, to make it more clear that each list points to what.
