mm/memory-failure: Add memory_failure_queue_kick()

The GHES code calls memory_failure_queue() from IRQ context to schedule
work on the current CPU so that memory_failure() can sleep.

For synchronous memory errors the arch code needs to know any signals
that memory_failure() will trigger are pending before it returns to
user-space, possibly when exiting from the IRQ.

Add a helper to kick the memory failure queue, to ensure the scheduled
work has happened. This has to be called from process context, so may
have been migrated from the original cpu. Pass the cpu the work was
queued on.

Change memory_failure_work_func() to permit being called on the 'wrong'
cpu.
