erofs: fix partially uninitialized misuse in z_erofs_onlinepage_fixup

Hongyu reported "id != index" in z_erofs_onlinepage_fixup() with
specific aarch64 environment easily, which wasn't shown before.

After digging into that, I found that high 32 bits of page->private
was set to 0xaaaaaaaa rather than 0 (due to z_erofs_onlinepage_init
behavior with specific compiler options). Actually we only use low
32 bits to keep the page information since page->private is only 4
bytes on most 32-bit platforms. However z_erofs_onlinepage_fixup()
uses the upper 32 bits by mistake.

Let's fix it now.
