usb: gadget: lpc32xx_udc: don't dereference ep pointer before null check

Currently pointer ep is being dereferenced before it is null checked
leading to a null pointer dereference issue.  Fix this by only assigning
pointer udc once ep is known to be not null.  Also remove a debug
message that requires a valid udc which may not be possible at that
point.
