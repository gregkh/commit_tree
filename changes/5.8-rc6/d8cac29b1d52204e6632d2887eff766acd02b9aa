vfio-ccw: Introduce a new CRW region

This region provides a mechanism to pass a Channel Report Word
that affect vfio-ccw devices, and needs to be passed to the guest
for its awareness and/or processing.

The base driver (see crw_collect_info()) provides space for two
CRWs, as a subchannel event may have two CRWs chained together
(one for the ssid, one for the subchannel).  As vfio-ccw will
deal with everything at the subchannel level, provide space
for a single CRW to be transferred in one shot.
