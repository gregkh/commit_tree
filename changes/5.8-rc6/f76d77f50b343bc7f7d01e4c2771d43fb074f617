mei: me: disable mei interface on Mehlow server platforms

For SPS firmware versions 5.0 and newer the way detection has changed.
The detection is done now via PCI_CFG_HFS_3 register.
To prevent conflict the previous method will get sps_4 suffix
Disable both CNP_H and CNP_H_3 interfaces. CNP_H_3 requires
a separate configuration as it doesn't support DMA.
