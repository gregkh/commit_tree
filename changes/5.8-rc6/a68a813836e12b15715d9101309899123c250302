net: phy: Add cable test support to state machine

Running a cable test is desruptive to normal operation of the PHY and
can take a 5 to 10 seconds to complete. The RTNL lock cannot be held
for this amount of time, and add a new state to the state machine for
running a cable test.

The driver is expected to implement two functions. The first is used
to start a cable test. Once the test has started, it should return.

The second function is called once per second, or on interrupt to
check if the cable test is complete, and to allow the PHY to report
the status.

v2:
Rename phy_cable_test_abort to phy_abort_cable_test
Return different extack when already running test
Use phy_init_hw() to reset the PHY
