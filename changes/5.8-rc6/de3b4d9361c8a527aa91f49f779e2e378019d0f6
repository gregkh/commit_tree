drm/i915/gt: Restore aggressive post-boost downclocking

observation that the smoothness of animations suffered. However, since
reducing the evalution intervals, we should be able to respond to the
rapidly fluctuating workload of a simple desktop animation and so
restore the more aggressive downclocking.
