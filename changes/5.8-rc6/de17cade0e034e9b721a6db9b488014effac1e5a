mtd: rawnand: ingenic: Fix the probe error path

nand_release() is supposed be called after MTD device registration.
Here, only nand_scan() happened, so use nand_cleanup() instead.

There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
in this driver predates the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
which makes this change possible. Hence, pointing it as the commit to
fix for backporting purposes, even if this commit is not introducing
any bug makes sense.
