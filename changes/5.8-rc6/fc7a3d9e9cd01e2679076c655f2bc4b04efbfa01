thermal: cpuidle: Register cpuidle cooling device

The cpuidle driver can be used as a cooling device by injecting idle
cycles.

When the property is set, register the cpuidle driver with the idle
state node pointer as a cooling device. The thermal framework will do
the association automatically with the thermal zone via the
cooling-device defined in the device tree cooling-maps section.
