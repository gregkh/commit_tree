rcu-tasks: Refactor RCU-tasks to allow variants to be added

This commit splits out generic processing from RCU-tasks-specific
processing in order to allow additional flavors to be added.  It also
adds a def_bool TASKS_RCU_GENERIC to enable the common RCU-tasks
infrastructure code.

This is primarily, but not entirely, a code-movement commit.
