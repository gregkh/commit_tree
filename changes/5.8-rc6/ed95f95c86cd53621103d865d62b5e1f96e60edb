kcsan: Fix 0-sized checks

Instrumentation of arbitrary memory-copy functions, such as user-copies,
may be called with size of 0, which could lead to false positives.

To avoid this, add a comparison in check_access() for size==0, which
will be optimized out for constant sized instrumentation
(__tsan_{read,write}N), and therefore not affect the common-case
fast-path.
