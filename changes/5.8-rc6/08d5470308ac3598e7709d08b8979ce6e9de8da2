serial: core: fix sysrq overhead regression

Commit 8e20fc391711 ("serial_core: Move sysrq functions from header
file") converted the inline sysrq helpers to exported functions which
are now called for every received character, interrupt and break signal
also on systems without CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL instead of being
optimised away by the compiler.

Inlining these helpers again also avoids the function call overhead when
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL is enabled (e.g. when the port is not used as
a console).
