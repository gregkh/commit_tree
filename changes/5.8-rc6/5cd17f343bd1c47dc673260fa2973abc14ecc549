btrfs: speed up and simplify generic_bin_search

The bin search jumps over the extent buffer item keys, comparing
directly the bytes if the key is in one page, or storing it in a
temporary buffer in case it spans two pages.

The mapping start and length are obtained from map_private_extent_buffer,
which is heavy weight compared to what we need. We know the key size and
can find out the eb page in a simple way.  For keys spanning two pages
the fallback read_extent_buffer is used.

The temporary variables are reduced and moved to the scope of use.
