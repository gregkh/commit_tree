cfg80211: adapt to new channelization of the 6GHz band

The 6GHz band does not have regulatory approval yet, but things are
moving forward. However, that has led to a change in the channelization
of the 6GHz band which has been accepted in the 11ax specification. It
also fixes a missing MHZ_TO_KHZ() macro for 6GHz channels while at it.

This change is primarily thrown in to discuss how to deal with it.
I noticed ath11k adding 6G support with old channelization and ditto
for iw. It probably involves changes in hostapd as well.
