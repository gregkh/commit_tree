mtd: rawnand: Avoid indirect access to ->data_buf()

The logic in nand_do_read_ops() is to use a bufpoi variable, either
set to the original buffer, or set to a bounce buffer which in the end
happens to be chip->data_buf depending on the value of the
use_bounce_buf boolean. This is not a reason to call chip->data_buf
directly when we know that we are using the bounce buffer. Let's use
bufpoi instead to be consistent.
