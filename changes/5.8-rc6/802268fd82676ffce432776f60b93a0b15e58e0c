powerpc/xmon: Remove store_inst() for patch_instruction()

For modifying instructions in xmon, patch_instruction() can serve the
same role that store_inst() is performing with the advantage of not
being specific to xmon. In some places patch_instruction() is already
being using followed by store_inst(). In these cases just remove the
store_inst(). Otherwise replace store_inst() with patch_instruction().
