hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the VMBus channel

vmbus_chan_sched() might call the netvsc driver callback function that
ends up scheduling NAPI work.  This "work" can access the channel ring
buffer, so we must ensure that any such work is completed and that the
ring buffer is no longer being accessed before freeing the ring buffer
data structure in the channel closure path.  To this end, disable NAPI
before calling vmbus_close() in netvsc_device_remove().
