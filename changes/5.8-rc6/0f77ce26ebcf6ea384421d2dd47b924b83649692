Revert "ARM: sti: Implement dummy L2 cache's write_sec"

This reverts commit 7b8e0188fa717cd9abc4fb52587445b421835c2a.

Initially, STiH410-B2260 was supposed to be secured, that's why
l2c_write_sec was stubbed to avoid secure register access from
non secure world.

But by default, STiH410-B2260 is running in non secure mode,
so L2 cache register accesses are authorized, l2c_write_sec stub
is not needed.

With this patch, L2 cache is configured and performance are enhanced.
