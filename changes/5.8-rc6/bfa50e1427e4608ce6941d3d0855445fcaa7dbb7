vfio-ccw: make vfio_ccw_regops variables declarations static

Fixes the following sparse warnings:
drivers/s390/cio/vfio_ccw_chp.c:62:30: warning: symbol 'vfio_ccw_schib_region_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/s390/cio/vfio_ccw_chp.c:117:30: warning: symbol 'vfio_ccw_crw_region_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
