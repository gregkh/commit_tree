selftests/bpf: Fix sample_cnt shared between two threads

Make sample_cnt volatile to fix possible selftests failure due to compiler
optimization preventing latest sample_cnt value to be visible to main thread.
sample_cnt is incremented in background thread, which is then joined into main
thread. So in terms of visibility sample_cnt update is ok. But because it's
not volatile, compiler might make optimizations that would prevent main thread
to see latest updated value. Fix this by marking global variable volatile.
