net/filter: Permit reading NET in load_bytes_relative when MAC not set

Added a check in the switch case on start_header that checks for
the existence of the header, and in the case that MAC is not set
and the caller requests for MAC, -EFAULT. If the caller requests
for NET then MAC's existence is completely ignored.

There is no function to check NET header's existence and as far
as cgroup_skb/egress is concerned it should always be set.

Removed for ptr >= the start of header, considering offset is
bounded unsigned and should always be true. len <= end - mac is
redundant to ptr + len <= end.
