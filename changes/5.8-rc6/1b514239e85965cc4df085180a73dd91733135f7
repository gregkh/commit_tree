bpf: flow_dissector: Check value of unused flags to BPF_PROG_ATTACH

Using BPF_PROG_ATTACH on a flow dissector program supports neither
target_fd, attach_flags or replace_bpf_fd but accepts any value.

Enforce that all of them are zero. This is fine for replace_bpf_fd
since its presence is indicated by BPF_F_REPLACE. It's more
problematic for target_fd, since zero is a valid fd. Should we
want to use the flag later on we'd have to add an exception for
fd 0. The alternative is to force a value like -1. This requires
more changes to tests. There is also precedent for using 0,
since bpf_iter uses this for target_fd as well.
