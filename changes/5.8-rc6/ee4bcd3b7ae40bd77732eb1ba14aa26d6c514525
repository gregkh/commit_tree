net: hns3: refactor the MAC address configure

Currently, the HNS3 driver sync and unsync MAC address in function
hns3_set_rx_mode(). For PF, it adds and deletes MAC address directly
in the path of dev_set_rx_mode(). If failed, it won't retry until
next calling of hns3_set_rx_mode(). On the other hand, if request
add and remove a same address many times at a short interval, each
request must be done one by one, can't be merged. For VF, it sends
mailbox messages to PF to request adding or deleting MAC address in
the path of function hns3_set_rx_mode(), no matter the address is
configured success.

This patch refines it by recording the MAC address in function
hns3_set_rx_mode(), and updating MAC address in the service task.
If failed, it will retry by the next calling of periodical service
task. It also uses some state to mark the state of each MAC address
in the MAC list, which can help merge configure request for a same
address. With these changes, when global reset or IMP reset occurs,
we can restore the MAC table with the MAC list.
