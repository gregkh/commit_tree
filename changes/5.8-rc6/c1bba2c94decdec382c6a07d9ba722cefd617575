dt-bindings: thermal: Add yaml bindings for thermal sensors

As part of moving the thermal bindings to YAML, split it up into 3
bindings: thermal sensors, cooling devices and thermal zones.

The property #thermal-sensor-cells is required in each device that acts
as a thermal sensor. It is used to uniquely identify the instance of the
thermal sensor inside the system.
