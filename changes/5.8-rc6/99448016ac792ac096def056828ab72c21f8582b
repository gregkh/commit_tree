s390/protvirt: use scnprintf() instead of snprintf()

snprintf() returns the number of bytes that would be written,
which may be greater than the the actual length to be written.

uv_query_facilities() should return the number of bytes printed
into the buffer. This is the return value of scnprintf().
The other functions are the same.
