mips: Remove compiler check in unroll macro

CONFIG_CC_IS_GCC is undefined when Clang is used, which breaks the build
(see our Travis link below).

Clang 8 was chosen as a minimum version for this check because there
were some improvements around __builtin_constant_p in that release. In
reality, MIPS was not even buildable until clang 9 so that check was not
technically necessary. Just remove all compiler checks and just assume
that we have a working compiler.
