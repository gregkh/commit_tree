drm/amdgpu: Changed CU reservation golden settings

With previous golden settings, compute task can't use
reserved LDS (32K) on CU0 and CU1. On 64K LDS system,
if compute work group allocate more than 32K LDS, then
it can't be dispatched to CU0 and CU1 because of the
reservation. This enables compute task to use reserved
LDS on CU0 and CU1.
