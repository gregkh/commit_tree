x86/entry: Convert INT3 exception to IDTENTRY_RAW

Convert #BP to IDTENTRY_RAW:
  - Implement the C entry point with DEFINE_IDTENTRY_RAW
  - Invoke idtentry_enter/exit() from the function body
  - Emit the ASM stub with DECLARE_IDTENTRY_RAW
  - Remove the ASM idtentry in 64bit
  - Remove the open coded ASM entry code in 32bit
  - Fixup the XEN/PV code
  - Remove the old prototypes

No functional change.

This could be a plain IDTENTRY, but as Peter pointed out INT3 is broken
vs. the static key in the context tracking code as this static key might be
in the state of being patched and has an int3 which would recurse forever.
IDTENTRY_RAW is therefore chosen to allow addressing this issue without
lots of code churn.
