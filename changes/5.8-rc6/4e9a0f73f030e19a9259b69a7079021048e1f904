efi: Clean up config table description arrays

Increase legibility by adding whitespace to the efi_config_table_type_t
arrays that describe which EFI config tables we look for when going over
the firmware provided list. While at it, replace the 'name' char pointer
with a char array, which is more space efficient on relocatable 64-bit
kernels, as it avoids a 8 byte pointer and the associated relocation
data (24 bytes when using RELA format)
