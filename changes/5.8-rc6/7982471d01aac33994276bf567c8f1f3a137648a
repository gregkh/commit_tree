drm: rcar-du: Set primary plane zpos immutably at initializing

According to drm_plane_create_zpos_property() function documentation,
all planes zpos range should be set if zpos property is supported.
However, the rcar-du driver didn't set primary plane zpos range. Since
the primary plane's zpos is fixed, set it immutably.
