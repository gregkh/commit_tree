nvme-fc: avoid gcc-10 zero-length-bounds warning

When CONFIG_ARCH_NO_SG_CHAIN is set, op->sgl[0] cannot be dereferenced,
as gcc-10 now points out:

drivers/nvme/host/fc.c: In function 'nvme_fc_init_request':
drivers/nvme/host/fc.c:1774:29: warning: array subscript 0 is outside the bounds of an interior zero-length array 'struct scatterlist[0]' [-Wzero-length-bounds]
 1774 |  op->op.fcp_req.first_sgl = &op->sgl[0];
      |                             ^~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/nvme/host/fc.c:98:21: note: while referencing 'sgl'
   98 |  struct scatterlist sgl[NVME_INLINE_SG_CNT];
      |                     ^~~

I don't know if this is a legitimate warning or a false-positive.
If this is just a false alarm, the warning is easily suppressed
by interpreting the array as a pointer.
