ovl: drop negative dentry in upper layer

Negative dentries of upper layer are useless after construction of
overlayfs' own dentry and may keep in the memory long time even after
unmount of overlayfs instance. This patch tries to drop unnecessary
negative dentry of upper layer to effectively reclaim memory.
