uacce: Remove mm_exit() op

The mm_exit() op will be removed from the SVA API. When a process dies
and its mm goes away, the IOMMU driver won't notify device drivers
anymore. Drivers should expect to handle a lot more aborted DMA. On the
upside, it does greatly simplify the queue management.

The uacce_mm struct, that tracks all queues bound to an mm, was only
used by the mm_exit() callback. Remove it.
