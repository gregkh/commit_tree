drm/bridge: fix stack usage warning on old gcc

Some older versions of gcc badly optimize code that passes
an inline function argument into another function by reference,
causing huge stack usage:

drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/tc358768.c: In function 'tc358768_bridge_pre_enable':
drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/tc358768.c:840:1: error: the frame size of 2256 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

Use a temporary variable as a workaround and add a comment pointing
to the gcc bug.
