drm/i915/gem: Drop cached obj->bind_count

We cached the number of vma bound to the object in order to speed up
shrinker decisions. This has been superseded by being more proactive in
removing objects we cannot shrink from the shrinker lists, and so we can
drop the clumsy attempt at atomically counting the bind count and
comparing it to the number of pinned mappings of the object. This will
only get more clumsier with asynchronous binding and unbinding.
