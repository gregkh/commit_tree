x86/entry, nmi: Disable #DB

Instead of playing stupid games with IST stacks, fully disallow #DB
during NMIs. There is absolutely no reason to allow them, and killing
this saves a heap of trouble.

#DB is already forbidden on noinstr and CEA, so there can't be a #DB before
this. Disabling it right after nmi_enter() ensures that the full NMI code
is protected.
