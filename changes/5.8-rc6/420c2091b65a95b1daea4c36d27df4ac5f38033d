mm/gup: introduce pin_user_pages_locked()

Patch series "mm/gup: introduce pin_user_pages_locked(), use it in frame_vector.c", v2.

This adds yet one more pin_user_pages*() variant, and uses that to
convert mm/frame_vector.c.

With this, along with maybe 20 or 30 other recent patches in various
trees, we are close to having the relevant gup call sites
converted--with the notable exception of the bio/block layer.

This patch (of 2):

Introduce pin_user_pages_locked(), which is nearly identical to
get_user_pages_locked() except that it sets FOLL_PIN and rejects
FOLL_GET.

As with other pairs of get_user_pages*() and pin_user_pages() API calls,
it's prudent to assert that FOLL_PIN is *not* set in the
get_user_pages*() call, so add that as part of this.
