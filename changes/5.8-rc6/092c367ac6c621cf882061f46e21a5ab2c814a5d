drm/edid: Fix DispID tile parsing for override EDID

Currently the DispID tile block gets parsed in drm_get_edid(), which
is an odd place for it considering we parse nothing else there. Also
this doesn't work for override EDIDs since
drm_connector_update_edid_property() refuses to do its job twice
in such cases. Thus we never update the tile property with results
of the DispID tile block parsing during drm_get_edid().

To fix this let's just move the tile block parsing to happen during
drm_connector_update_edid_property(), which is where we parse a bunch
of other stuff as well (and where we update both the EDID and tile
properties).
