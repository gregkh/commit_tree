null_blk: force complete for timeout request

The commit 7b11eab041da ("blk-mq: blk-mq: provide forced completion
method") exports new API to force a request to complete without error
injection.

There should be no error injection when completing a request by timeout
handler.

Otherwise, the below would hang because timeout handler is failed.

echo 100 > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_io_timeout/probability
echo 1000 > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_io_timeout/times
echo 1 > /sys/block/nullb0/io-timeout-fail
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nullb0 bs=512 count=1 oflag=direct

With this patch, the timeout handler is able to complete the IO.
