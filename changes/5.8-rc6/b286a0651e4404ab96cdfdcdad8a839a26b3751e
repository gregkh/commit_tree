net/smc: handle incoming CDC validation message

Call smc_cdc_msg_validate() when a CDC message with the failover
validation bit enabled was received. Validate that the sequence number
sent with the message is one we already have received. If not, messages
were lost and the connection is terminated using a new abort_work.
