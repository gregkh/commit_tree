dt-bindings: i2c: Convert i2c-jz4780.txt to YAML

Convert the i2c-jz4780.txt file to ingenic,i2c.yaml.

Two things were changed in the process:
- the clock-frequency property can now only be set to the two values
  that can be set by the hardware;
- the dmas and dma-names properties are now required.
