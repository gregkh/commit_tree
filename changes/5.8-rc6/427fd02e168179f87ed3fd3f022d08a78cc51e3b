staging: wfx: update filtering even if not connected

Currently, filtering are not update if the device is not connected.
There is no obvious rationale for that. Updating filtering while it is
not necessary is harmless. On the other hand, it is difficult to ensure
that the filtering rule has been correctly sent to the firmware.

Just drop this useless condition.
