brcmfmac: map 802.1d priority to precedence level based on AP WMM params

In WLAN, priority among various access categories of traffic is
always set by the AP using WMM parameters and this may not always
follow the standard 802.1d priority.

In this change, priority is adjusted based on the AP WMM params
received as part of the Assoc Response and the same is later used
to map the priority of all incoming traffic.

In a specific scenario where EDCA parameters are configured to be same
for all ACs, use the default FW priority definition to avoid queuing
packets of all ACs to the same priority queue.

This change fixes the following 802.11 certification tests:
* 11n - 5.2.31 ACM Bit Conformance test
* 11n - 5.2.32 AC Parameter Modification test
* 11ac - 5.2.33 TXOP Limit test
