x86/resctrl: Fix memory bandwidth counter width for AMD

Memory bandwidth is calculated reading the monitoring counter
at two intervals and calculating the delta. It is the softwareâ€™s
responsibility to read the count often enough to avoid having
the count roll over _twice_ between reads.

The current code hardcodes the bandwidth monitoring counter's width
to 24 bits for AMD. This is due to default base counter width which
is 24. Currently, AMD does not implement the CPUID 0xF.[ECX=1]:EAX
to adjust the counter width. But, the AMD hardware supports much
wider bandwidth counter with the default width of 44 bits.

Kernel reads these monitoring counters every 1 second and adjusts the
counter value for overflow. With 24 bits and scale value of 64 for AMD,
it can only measure up to 1GB/s without overflowing. For the rates
above 1GB/s this will fail to measure the bandwidth.

Fix the issue setting the default width to 44 bits by adjusting the
offset.

AMD future products will implement CPUID 0xF.[ECX=1]:EAX.
