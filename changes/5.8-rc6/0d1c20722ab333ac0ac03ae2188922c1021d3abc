mm: memcontrol: switch to native NR_FILE_PAGES and NR_SHMEM counters

Memcg maintains private MEMCG_CACHE and NR_SHMEM counters.  This
divergence from the generic VM accounting means unnecessary code overhead,
and creates a dependency for memcg that page->mapping is set up at the
time of charging, so that page types can be told apart.

Convert the generic accounting sites to mod_lruvec_page_state and friends
to maintain the per-cgroup vmstat counters of NR_FILE_PAGES and NR_SHMEM.
The page is already locked in these places, so page->mem_cgroup is stable;
we only need minimal tweaks of two mem_cgroup_migrate() calls to ensure
it's set up in time.

Then replace MEMCG_CACHE with NR_FILE_PAGES and delete the private
NR_SHMEM accounting sites.
