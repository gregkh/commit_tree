objtool: Move the IRET hack into the arch decoder

Quoting Julien:

  "And the other suggestion is my other email was that you don't even
  need to add INSN_EXCEPTION_RETURN. You can keep IRET as
  INSN_CONTEXT_SWITCH by default and x86 decoder lookups the symbol
  conaining an iret. If it's a function symbol, it can just set the type
  to INSN_OTHER so that it caries on to the next instruction after
  having handled the stack_op."
