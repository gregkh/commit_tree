EDAC, {skx,i10nm}: Make some configurations CPU model specific

The device ID for configuration agent PCI device and the offset for
bus number configuration register can be CPU model specific. So add
a new structure res_config to make them configurable and pass res_config
to {skx,i10nm}_init() and skx_get_all_bus_mappings() for use.
