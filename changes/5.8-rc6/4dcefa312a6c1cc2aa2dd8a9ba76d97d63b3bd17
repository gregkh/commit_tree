KVM: nVMX: Rename exit_reason to vm_exit_reason for nested VM-Exit

Use "vm_exit_reason" for code related to injecting a nested VM-Exit to
VM-Exits to make it clear that nested_vmx_vmexit() expects the full exit
eason, not just the basic exit reason.  The basic exit reason (bits 15:0
of vmcs.VM_EXIT_REASON) is colloquially referred to as simply "exit
reason".

Note, other flows, e.g. vmx_handle_exit(), are intentionally left as is.
A future patch will convert vmx->exit_reason to a union + bit-field, and
the exempted flows will interact with the unionized of "exit_reason".
