KVM: nVMX: always update CR3 in VMCS

vmx_load_mmu_pgd is delaying the write of GUEST_CR3 to prepare_vmcs02 as
an optimization, but this is only correct before the nested vmentry.
If userspace is modifying CR3 with KVM_SET_SREGS after the VM has
already been put in guest mode, the value of CR3 will not be updated.
Remove the optimization, which almost never triggers anyway.
