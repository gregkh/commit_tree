arm64: vdso: use consistent 'map' nomenclature

The current code doesn't use a consistent naming scheme for structures,
enums, or variables, making it harder than necessary to determine the
relationship between these.

Let's make this easier by consistently using 'map' nomenclature for
mappings created in userspace, minimizing redundant comments, and
using designated array initializers to tie indices to their respective
elements.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
