xfs: refactor xfs_iomap_prealloc_size

Refactor xfs_iomap_prealloc_size to be the function that dynamically
computes the per-file preallocation size by moving the allocsize= case
to the caller.  Break up the huge comment preceding the function to
annotate the relevant parts of the code, and remove the impossible
check_writeio case.
