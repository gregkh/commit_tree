net_sched: sch_fq: add horizon attribute

QUIC servers would like to use SO_TXTIME, without having CAP_NET_ADMIN,
to efficiently pace UDP packets.

As far as sch_fq is concerned, we need to add safety checks, so
that a buggy application does not fill the qdisc with packets
having delivery time far in the future.

This patch adds a configurable horizon (default: 10 seconds),
and a configurable policy when a packet is beyond the horizon
at enqueue() time:
- either drop the packet (default policy)
- or cap its delivery time to the horizon.
