mm/page_alloc: restrict and formalize compound_page_dtors[]

Restrict elements in compound_page_dtors[] array per NR_COMPOUND_DTORS and
explicitly position them according to enum compound_dtor_id.  This
improves protection against possible misalignment between
compound_page_dtors[] and enum compound_dtor_id later on.
