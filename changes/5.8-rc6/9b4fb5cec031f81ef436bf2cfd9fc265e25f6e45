fault_inject: Don't rely on "return value" from WRITE_ONCE()

It's a bit weird that WRITE_ONCE() evaluates to the value it stores and
it's different to smp_store_release(), which can't be used this way.

In preparation for preventing this in WRITE_ONCE(), change the fault
injection code to use a local variable instead.
