net: phy: mscc: fix Serdes configuration in vsc8584_config_init

When converting the MSCC PHY driver to shared PHY packages, the Serdes
configuration in vsc8584_config_init was modified to use 'base_addr'
instead of 'base' as the port number. But 'base_addr' isn't equal to
'addr' for all PHYs inside the package, which leads to the Serdes still
being enabled on those ports. This patch fixes it.
