drm/hisilicon/hibmc: Move drm_fbdev_generic_setup() down to avoid the splat

The HiSilicon hibmc driver triggers a splat at boot time as below

This turned out to be due to the fbdev device hasn't been registered when
drm_fbdev_generic_setup() is invoked. Let's fix the splat by moving it down
after drm_dev_register() which will follow the "Display driver example"
documented by commit de99f0600a79 ("drm/drv: DOC: Add driver example
code").
