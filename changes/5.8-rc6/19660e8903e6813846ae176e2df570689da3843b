drm/v3d: make v3d_debugfs_init() return 0

Since commit 987d65d01356 (drm: debugfs: make
drm_debugfs_create_files() never fail), drm_debugfs_create_files() never
fails and should return void. Therefore, remove its use as the
return value of v3d_debugfs_init() and have the function return 0
directly instead.

v2: remove conversion of v3d_debugfs_init() to void to avoid build
breakage and enable individual compilation.
