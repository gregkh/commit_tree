mlxsw: spectrum: Share one group for all locally delivered packets

Routed IP packets with the Router Alert option need to be trapped to
the CPU as they might need to be locally delivered to raw sockets with
the IP_ROUTER_ALERT / IPV6_ROUTER_ALERT socket option.

Move them to the same group with other packets that might need to be
trapped following route lookup.
