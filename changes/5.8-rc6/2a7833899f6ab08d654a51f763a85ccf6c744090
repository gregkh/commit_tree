KVM: nVMX: Cast exit_reason to u16 to check for nested EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT

Explicitly check only the basic exit reason when emulating an external
interrupt VM-Exit in nested_vmx_vmexit().  Checking the full exit reason
doesn't currently cause problems, but only because the only exit reason
modifier support by KVM is FAILED_VMENTRY, which is mutually exclusive
with EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT.  Future modifiers, e.g. ENCLAVE_MODE, will
coexist with EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT.
