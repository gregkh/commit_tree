kdb: don't play with console_loglevel

Print the stack trace with KERN_EMERG - it should be always visible.

Playing with console_loglevel is a bad idea as there may be more messages
printed than wanted.  Also the stack trace might be not printed at all if
printk() was deferred and console_loglevel was raised back before the
trace got flushed.

Unfortunately, after rebasing on commit 2277b492582d ("kdb: Fix stack
crawling on 'running' CPUs that aren't the master"), kdb_show_stack() uses
now kdb_dump_stack_on_cpu(), which for now won't be converted as it uses
dump_stack() instead of show_stack().

Convert for now the branch that uses show_stack() and remove
console_loglevel exercise from that case.
