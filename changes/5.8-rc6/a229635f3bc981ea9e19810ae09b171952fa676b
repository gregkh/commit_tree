mfd: vexpress-sysreg: Drop selecting CONFIG_CLKSRC_MMIO

Nothing in the VExpress sysregs nor the MFD child drivers use
CONFIG_CLKSRC_MMIO. There's the 24MHz counter, but that's handled by
drivers/clocksource/timer-versatile.c which doesn't use
CONFIG_CLKSRC_MMIO either. So let's just drop CONFIG_CLKSRC_MMIO.

As the !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET dependency was added for
CONFIG_CLKSRC_MMIO, that can be dropped, too.
