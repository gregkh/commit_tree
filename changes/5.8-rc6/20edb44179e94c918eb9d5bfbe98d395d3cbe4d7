staging: fbtft: fb_st7789v: make HSD20_IPS numeric and not a string

Currently HSD20_IPS is defined as "true" and will always result in a
non-zero result even if it is defined as "false" because it is an array
and that will never be zero. Fix this by defining it as an integer 1
rather than a literal string.

Addessses-Coverity: ("Array compared against 0")
