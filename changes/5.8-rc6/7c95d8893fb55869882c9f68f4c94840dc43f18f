powerpc: Change calling convention for create_branch() et. al.

create_branch(), create_cond_branch() and translate_branch() return the
instruction that they create, or return 0 to signal an error. Separate
these concerns in preparation for an instruction type that is not just
an unsigned int.  Fill the created instruction to a pointer passed as
the first parameter to the function and use a non-zero return value to
signify an error.
