net/mlx5: Fix eeprom support for SFP module

Fix eeprom SFP query support by setting i2c_addr, offset and page number
correctly. Unlike QSFP modules, SFP eeprom params are as follow:
- i2c_addr is 0x50 for offset 0 - 255 and 0x51 for offset 256 - 511.
- Page number is always zero.
- Page offset is always relative to zero.

As part of eeprom query, query the module ID (SFP / QSFP*) via helper
function to set the params accordingly.

In addition, change mlx5_qsfp_eeprom_page() input type to be u16 to avoid
unnecessary casting.
