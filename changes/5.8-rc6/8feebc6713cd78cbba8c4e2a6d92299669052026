posix-cpu-timer: Tidy up group_leader logic in lookup_task

Replace has_group_leader_pid with thread_group_leader.  Years ago Oleg
suggested changing thread_group_leader to has_group_leader_pid to handle
races.  Looking at the code then and now I don't see how it ever helped.
Especially as then the code really did need to be the
thread_group_leader.

Today it doesn't make a difference if thread_group_leader races with
de_thread as the task returned from lookup_task in the non-thread case is
just used to find values in task->signal.

Since the races with de_thread have never been handled revert
has_group_header_pid to thread_group_leader for clarity.

Update the comment in lookup_task to remove implementation details that
are no longer true and to mention task->signal instead of task->sighand,
as the relevant cpu timer details are all in task->signal.
