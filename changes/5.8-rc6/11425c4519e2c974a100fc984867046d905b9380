drm/ttm: Fix dma_fence refcnt leak when adding move fence

ttm_bo_add_move_fence() invokes dma_fence_get(), which returns a
reference of the specified dma_fence object to "fence" with increased
refcnt.

When ttm_bo_add_move_fence() returns, local variable "fence" becomes
invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
ttm_bo_add_move_fence(). When no_wait_gpu flag is equals to true, the
function forgets to decrease the refcnt increased by dma_fence_get(),
causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by calling dma_fence_put() when no_wait_gpu flag is
equals to true.
