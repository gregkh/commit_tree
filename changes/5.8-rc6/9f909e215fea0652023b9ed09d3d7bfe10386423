drm/i915: Implement vm_ops->access for gdb access into mmaps

gdb uses ptrace() to peek and poke bytes of the target's address space.
The driver must implement an vm_ops->access() handler or else gdb will
be unable to inspect the pointer and report it as out-of-bounds.
Worse than useless as it causes immediate suspicion of the valid GTT
pointer, distracting the poor programmer trying to find his bug.

v2: Write-protect readonly objects (Matthew).
