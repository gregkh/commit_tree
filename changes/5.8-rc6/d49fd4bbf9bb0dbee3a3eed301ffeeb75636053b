efi/gop: Remove unreachable code from setup_pixel_info

pixel_format must be one of
	PIXEL_RGB_RESERVED_8BIT_PER_COLOR
	PIXEL_BGR_RESERVED_8BIT_PER_COLOR
	PIXEL_BIT_MASK
since we skip PIXEL_BLT_ONLY when finding a gop.

Remove the redundant code and add another check in find_gop to skip any
pixel formats that we don't know about, in case a later version of the
UEFI spec adds one.

Reformat the code a little.
