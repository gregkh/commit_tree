mac80211: mlme: remove duplicate AID bookkeeping

Maintain the connection AID only in sdata->vif.bss_conf.aid, not
also in sdata->u.mgd.aid.

Keep setting that where we set ifmgd->aid before, which has the
side effect of exposing the AID to the driver before the station
entry (AP) is marked associated, in case it needs it then.
