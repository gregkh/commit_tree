perf stat: Save aggr value to first member of prev_raw_counts

To collect the overall statistics for interval mode, we copy the counts
from evsel->prev_raw_counts to evsel->counts.

For AGGR_GLOBAL mode, because the perf_stat_process_counter creates aggr
values from per cpu values, but the per cpu values are 0, so the
calculated aggr values will be always 0.

This patch uses a trick that saves the previous aggr value to the first
member of perf_counts, then aggr calculation in process_counter_values
can work correctly for AGGR_GLOBAL.
