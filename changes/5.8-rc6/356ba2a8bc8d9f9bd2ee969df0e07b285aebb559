scsi: target: tcmu: Make pgr_support and alua_support attributes writable

Currently in tcmu reservation commands are handled by core's pr
implementation (default) or completely rejected (emulate_pr set to 0). We
additionally want to be able to do full reservation handling in
userspace. Therefore we need a way to set TRANSPORT_FLAG_PASSTHROUGH_PGR.

The inverted flag is displayed by attribute pgr_support.  Since we moved
the flag from transport/backend to se_device in the previous commit, we now
can make it changeable per device by allowing to write the attribute.  The
new field transport_flags_changeable in transport/backend is used to reject
writing if not allowed for a backend.

Regarding ALUA we also want to be able to passthrough commands to userspace
in tcmu. Therefore we need TRANSPORT_FLAG_PASSTHROUGH_ALUA to be
changeable, because by setting it we can switch off all ALUA checks in
core. So we also set TRANSPORT_FLAG_PASSTHROUGH_ALUA in tcmu's
transport_flags_changeable.

Of course, ALUA and reservation handling in userspace will work only, if
session/nexus information is sent to userspace along with every
command. This will be object of a patch series announced by Mike Christie.
