powerpc: Enable Prefixed Instructions

Prefix instructions have their own FSCR bit which needs to enabled via
a CPU feature. The kernel will save the FSCR for problem state but it
needs to be enabled initially.

If prefixed instructions are made unavailable by the [H]FSCR, attempting
to use them will cause a facility unavailable exception. Add "PREFIX" to
the facility_strings[].

Currently there are no prefixed instructions that are actually emulated
by emulate_instruction() within facility_unavailable_exception().
However, when caused by a prefixed instructions the SRR1 PREFIXED bit is
set. Prepare for dealing with emulated prefixed instructions by checking
for this bit.
