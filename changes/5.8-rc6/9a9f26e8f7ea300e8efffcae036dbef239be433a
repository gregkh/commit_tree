bridge: mrp: Connect MRP API with the switchdev API

Implement the MRP API.

In case the HW can't generate MRP Test frames then the SW will try to generate
the frames. In case that also the SW will fail in generating the frames then a
error is return to the userspace. The userspace is responsible to generate all
the other MRP frames regardless if the test frames are generated by HW or SW.

The forwarding/termination of MRP frames is happening in the kernel and is done
by the MRP instance. The userspace application doesn't do the forwarding.
