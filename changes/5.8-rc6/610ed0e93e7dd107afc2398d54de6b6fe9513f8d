ice: Don't reset and rebuild for Tx timeout on PFC enabled queue

When there's a Tx timeout for a queue which belongs to a PFC enabled TC,
then it's not because the queue is hung but because PFC is in action.

In PFC, peer sends a pause frame for a specified period of time when its
buffer threshold is exceeded (due to congestion). Netdev on the other
hand checks if ACK is received within a specified time for a TX packet, if
not, it'll invoke the tx_timeout routine.
