kcov: cleanup debug messages

Patch series "kcov: collect coverage from usb soft interrupts", v4.

This patchset extends kcov to allow collecting coverage from soft
interrupts and then uses the new functionality to collect coverage from
USB code.

This has allowed to find at least one new HID bug [1], which was recently
fixed by Alan [2].

Any subsystem that uses softirqs (e.g. timers) can make use of this in
the future. Looking at the recent syzbot reports, an obvious candidate
is the networking subsystem [3, 4, 5 and many more].
