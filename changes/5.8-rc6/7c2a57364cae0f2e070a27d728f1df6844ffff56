x86/irq: Rework handle_irq() for 64-bit

To consolidate the interrupt entry/exit code vs. the other exceptions
make handle_irq() an inline and handle both 64-bit and 32-bit mode.

Preparatory change to move irq stack switching for 64-bit to C which allows
to consolidate the entry exit handling by reusing the idtentry machinery
both in ASM and C.
