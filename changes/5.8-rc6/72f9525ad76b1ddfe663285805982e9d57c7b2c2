virtio-mem: Try to unplug the complete online memory block first

Right now, we always try to unplug single subblocks when processing an
online memory block. Let's try to unplug the complete online memory block
first, in case it is fully plugged and the unplug request is large
enough. Fallback to single subblocks in case the memory block cannot get
unplugged as a whole.
