drm/i915/gt: Always enable busy-stats for execlists

In the near future, we will utilize the busy-stats on each engine to
approximate the C0 cycles of each, and use that as an input to a manual
RPS mechanism. That entails having busy-stats always enabled and so we
can remove the enable/disable routines and simplify the pmu setup. As a
consequence of always having the stats enabled, we can also show the
current active time via sysfs/engine/xcs/active_time_ns.
