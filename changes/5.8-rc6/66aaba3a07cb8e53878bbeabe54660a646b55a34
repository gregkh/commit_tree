ubi: Relax the 'no MLC' rule and allow MLCs operating in SLC mode

The MTD layer provides an SLC mode (purely software emulation of SLC
behavior) addressing the paired-pages corruption issue, which was the
main reason for refusing attaching MLC NANDs to UBI.

Relax this rule and allow partitions that have the
MTD_EMULATE_SLC_ON_MLC flag set to be attached.
