arm64: cpufeature: Add CPU capability for AArch32 EL1 support

Although we emit a "SANITY CHECK" warning and taint the kernel if we
detect a CPU mismatch for AArch32 support at EL1, we still online the
CPU with disastrous consequences for any running 32-bit VMs.

Introduce a capability for AArch32 support at EL1 so that late onlining
of incompatible CPUs is forbidden.
