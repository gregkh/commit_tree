dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Fix the running channel handling in alloc_chan_resources

In the unlikely case when the channel is running (RT enabled) during
alloc_chan_resources then we should use udma_reset_chan() and not
udma_stop() as the later is trying to initiate a teardown on the channel,
which is not valid at this point.
