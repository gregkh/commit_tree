clocksource: dw_apb_timer: Affiliate of-based timer with any CPU

Currently any DW APB Timer device detected in OF is bound to CPU #0.
Doing so is redundant since DW APB Timer isn't CPU-local timer, but as
having APB interface is normally accessible from any CPU in the system. By
artificially affiliating the DW timer to the very first CPU we may and in
our case will make the clockevent subsystem to decline the more performant
real CPU-local timers selection in favor of in fact non-local and
accessible over a slow bus - DW APB Timers.

Let's not affiliate the of-detected DW APB Timers to any CPU. By doing so
the clockevent framework would prefer to select the real CPU-local timer
instead of DW APB one. Otherwise if there is no other than DW APB device
for clockevents tracking then it will be selected.
