flow_dissector: Pull BPF program assignment up to bpf-netns

Prepare for using bpf_prog_array to store attached programs by moving out
code that updates the attached program out of flow dissector.

Managing bpf_prog_array is more involved than updating a single bpf_prog
pointer. This will let us do it all from one place, bpf/net_namespace.c, in
the subsequent patch.

No functional change intended.
