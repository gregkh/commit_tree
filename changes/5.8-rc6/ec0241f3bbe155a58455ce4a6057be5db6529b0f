KVM: nVMX: Drop manual clearing of segment cache on nested VMCS switch

Drop the call to vmx_segment_cache_clear() in vmx_switch_vmcs() now that
the entire register cache is reset when switching the active VMCS, e.g.
vmx_segment_cache_test_set() will reset the segment cache due to
VCPU_EXREG_SEGMENTS being unavailable.

Move vmx_segment_cache_clear() to vmx.c now that it's no longer invoked
by the nested code.
