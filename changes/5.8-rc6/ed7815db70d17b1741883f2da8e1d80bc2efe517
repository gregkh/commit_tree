spi: spi-sun6i: sun6i_spi_transfer_one(): fix setting of clock rate

A SPI transfer defines the _maximum_ speed of the SPI transfer. However the
driver doesn't take into account that the clock divider is always rounded down
(due to integer arithmetics). This results in a too high clock rate for the SPI
transfer.

E.g.: with a mclk_rate of 24 MHz and a SPI transfer speed of 10 MHz, the
original code calculates a reg of "0", which results in a effective divider of
"2" and a 12 MHz clock for the SPI transfer.

This patch fixes the issue by using DIV_ROUND_UP() instead of a plain
integer division.

While there simplify the divider calculation for the CDR1 case, use
order_base_2() instead of two ilog2() calculations.
