media: Revert "media: atomisp: Add some ACPI detection info"

This reverts commit 0d64e9420583cbc3c4a3f949ebe38fd8f7769281.

As gmin_subdev_add() now takes the ACPI handle directly,
we can deprecate the code that were doing this inside each
I2C driver.

PS.: This also reverts commit c03496b3bd92 ("media: atomisp: add a notice about possible leak resources")
