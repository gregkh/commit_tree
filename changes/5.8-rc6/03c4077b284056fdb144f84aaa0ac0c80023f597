RDMA/mlx5: Rely on existence of udata to separate kernel/user flows

Instead of keeping special field to separate kernel/user create/destroy
flows, rely on existence of udata pointer. All allocation flows are
using kzalloc() and leave uninitialized pointers as NULL which makes
MLX5_QP_EMPTY and MLX5_QP_KERNEL flows to be the same.
