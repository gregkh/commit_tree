ALSA: firewire-lib: code refactoring for data block calculation

When calculating the number of data blocks per packet, some states are
stored in AMDTP stream structure. This is inconvenient when reuse the
calculation from non-stream structure.

This commit applies refactoring to helper function for the calculation
so that the function doesn't touch AMDTP stream structure.
