ARM: pxa: remove Compulab pxa2xx boards

As these boards have no more users nor testers, and patching them has
become a burden, be that because of the PCI part or the MTD NAND
support, let's remove them.

The cm-x300 will for now remain and represent Compulab boards at its
best in the PXA department.
