powerpc/crash: Use NMI context for printk when starting to crash

Currently, if printk lock (logbuf_lock) is held by other thread during
crash, there is a chance of deadlocking the crash on next printk, and
blocking a possibly desired kdump.

At the start of default_machine_crash_shutdown, make printk enter
NMI context, as it will use per-cpu buffers to store the message,
and avoid locking logbuf_lock.
