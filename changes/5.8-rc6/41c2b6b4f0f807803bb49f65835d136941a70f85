net: ethernet: mvneta: Add back interface mode validation

When writing the serdes configuration register was moved to
mvneta_config_interface() the whole code block was removed from
mvneta_port_power_up() in the assumption that its only purpose was to
write the serdes configuration register. As mentioned by Russell King
its purpose was also to check for valid interface modes early so that
later in the driver we do not have to care for unexpected interface
modes.
Add back the test to let the driver bail out early on unhandled
interface modes.
