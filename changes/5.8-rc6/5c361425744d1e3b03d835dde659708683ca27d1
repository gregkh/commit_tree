kcsan: Prefer __always_inline for fast-path

Prefer __always_inline for fast-path functions that are called outside
of user_access_save, to avoid generating UACCESS warnings when
optimizing for size (CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE). It will also avoid future
surprises with compiler versions that change the inlining heuristic even
when optimizing for performance.
