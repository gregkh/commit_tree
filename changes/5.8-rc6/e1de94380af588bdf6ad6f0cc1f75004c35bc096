ARM: 8978/1: mm: make act_mm() respect THREAD_SIZE

Recent work with KASan exposed the folling hard-coded bitmask
in arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S:

  bic     rd, sp, #8128
  bic     rd, rd, #63

This forms the bitmask 0x1FFF that is coinciding with
(PAGE_SIZE << THREAD_SIZE_ORDER) - 1, this code was assuming
that THREAD_SIZE is always 8K (8192).

As KASan was increasing THREAD_SIZE_ORDER to 2, I ran into
this bug.

Fix it by this little oneline suggested by Ard:

  bic     rd, sp, #(THREAD_SIZE - 1) & ~63

Where THREAD_SIZE is defined using THREAD_SIZE_ORDER.

We have to also include <linux/const.h> since the THREAD_SIZE
expands to use the _AC() macro.
