media: atomisp: Remove second increment of count in atomisp_subdev_probe

Clang warns:

../drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp_v4l2.c:1097:3: warning:
variable 'count' is incremented both in the loop header and in the loop
body [-Wfor-loop-analysis]
                count++;
                ^

This was probably unintentional, remove it.
