KVM: selftests: Add GUEST_ASSERT variants to pass values to host

Add variants of GUEST_ASSERT to pass values back to the host, e.g. to
help debug/understand a failure when the the cause of the assert isn't
necessarily binary.

It'd probably be possible to auto-calculate the number of arguments and
just have a single GUEST_ASSERT, but there are a limited number of
variants and silently eating arguments could lead to subtle code bugs.
