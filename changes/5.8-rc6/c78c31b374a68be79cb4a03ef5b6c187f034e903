Revert "Revert "driver core: Set fw_devlink to "permissive" behavior by default""

This reverts commit 18555cb6db2373b9a5ec1f7572773fd58c77f9ba.

The reason[1] for the original revert has now been fixed by
commit 00b247557858 ("driver core: Fix handling of
fw_devlink=permissive"). So, this patch reverts the revert. Marek has
also tested this patch with the fix mentioned above and confirmed that
the issue has been fixed.
