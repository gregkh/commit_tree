xfs: remove the m_active_trans counter

It's a global atomic counter, and we are hitting it at a rate of
half a million transactions a second, so it's bouncing the counter
cacheline all over the place on large machines. We don't actually
need it anymore - it used to be required because the VFS freeze code
could not track/prevent filesystem transactions that were running,
but that problem no longer exists.

Hence to remove the counter, we simply have to ensure that nothing
calls xfs_sync_sb() while we are trying to quiesce the filesytem.
That only happens if the log worker is still running when we call
xfs_quiesce_attr(). The log worker is cancelled at the end of
xfs_quiesce_attr() by calling xfs_log_quiesce(), so just call it
early here and then we can remove the counter altogether.

Concurrent create, 50 million inodes, identical 16p/16GB virtual
machines on different physical hosts. Machine A has twice the CPU
cores per socket of machine B:

		unpatched	patched
machine A:	3m16s		2m00s
machine B:	4m04s		4m05s

Create rates:
		unpatched	patched
machine A:	282k+/-31k	468k+/-21k
machine B:	231k+/-8k	233k+/-11k

Concurrent rm of same 50 million inodes:

		unpatched	patched
machine A:	6m42s		2m33s
machine B:	4m47s		4m47s

The transaction rate on the fast machine went from just under
300k/sec to 700k/sec, which indicates just how much of a bottleneck
this atomic counter was.
