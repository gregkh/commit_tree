bpf: Add support for BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD for bpf_link

Add ability to fetch bpf_link details through BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD command.
Also enhance show_fdinfo to potentially include bpf_link type-specific
information (similarly to obj_info).

Also introduce enum bpf_link_type stored in bpf_link itself and expose it in
UAPI. bpf_link_tracing also now will store and return bpf_attach_type.
