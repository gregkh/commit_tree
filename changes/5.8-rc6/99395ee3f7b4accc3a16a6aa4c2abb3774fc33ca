mm: ptdump: expand type of 'val' in note_page()

The page table entry is passed in the 'val' argument to note_page(),
however this was previously an "unsigned long" which is fine on 64-bit
platforms.  But for 32 bit x86 it is not always big enough to contain a
page table entry which may be 64 bits.

Change the type to u64 to ensure that it is always big enough.
