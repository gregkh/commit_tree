powerpc/pseries: Account for SPURR ticks on idle CPUs

On Pseries LPARs, to calculate utilization, we need to know the
[S]PURR ticks when the CPUs were busy or idle.

Via pseries_idle_prolog(), pseries_idle_epilog(), we track the idle
PURR ticks in the VPA variable "wait_state_cycles". This patch extends
the support to account for the idle SPURR ticks.
