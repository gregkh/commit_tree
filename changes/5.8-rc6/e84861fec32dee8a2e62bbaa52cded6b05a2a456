regmap: dev_get_regmap_match(): fix string comparison

This function is used by dev_get_regmap() to retrieve a regmap for the
specified device. If the device has more than one regmap, the name parameter
can be used to specify one.

The code here uses a pointer comparison to check for equal strings. This
however will probably always fail, as the regmap->name is allocated via
kstrdup_const() from the regmap's config->name.

Fix this by using strcmp() instead.
