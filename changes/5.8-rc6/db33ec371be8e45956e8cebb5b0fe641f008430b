doc: cgroup: update note about conditions when oom killer is invoked

Starting from v4.19 commit 29ef680ae7c2 ("memcg, oom: move out_of_memory
back to the charge path") cgroup oom killer is no longer invoked only
from page faults.  Now it implements the same semantics as global OOM
killer: allocation context invokes OOM killer and keeps retrying until
success.
