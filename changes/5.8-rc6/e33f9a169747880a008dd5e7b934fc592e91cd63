kcsan: Add __no_kcsan function attribute

Since the use of -fsanitize=thread is an implementation detail of KCSAN,
the name __no_sanitize_thread could be misleading if used widely.
Instead, we introduce the __no_kcsan attribute which is shorter and more
accurate in the context of KCSAN.

This matches the attribute name __no_kcsan_or_inline. The use of
__kcsan_or_inline itself is still required for __always_inline functions
to retain compatibility with older compilers.
