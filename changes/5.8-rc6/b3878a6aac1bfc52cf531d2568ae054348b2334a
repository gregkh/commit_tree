MIPS: Fix build warning about "PTR_STR" redefinition

PTR_STR is redefined when CONFIG_TEST_PRINTF is set. This causes the
following build warning:

  CC      lib/test_printf.o
lib/test_printf.c:214:0: warning: "PTR_STR" redefined
 #define PTR_STR "ffff0123456789ab"

Instead of renaming PTR_STR we move the unaligned macros to a new file,
which is only included inside MIPS code. This way we can safely include
asm.h and can use STR(PTR) again.
