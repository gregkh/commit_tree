objtool: Allow no-op CFI ops in alternatives

Randy reported a false-positive:

  arch/x86/hyperv/hv_apic.o: warning: objtool: hv_apic_write()+0x25: alternative modifies stack

What happens is that:

	alternative_io("movl %0, %P1", "xchgl %0, %P1", X86_BUG_11AP,
 13d:   89 9d 00 d0 7f ff       mov    %ebx,-0x803000(%rbp)

decodes to an instruction with CFI-ops because it modifies RBP.
However, due to this being a !frame-pointer build, that should not in
fact change the CFI state.

So instead of dis-allowing any CFI-op, verify the op would've actually
changed the CFI state.
