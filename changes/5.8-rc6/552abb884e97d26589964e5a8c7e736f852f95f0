cpufreq: Fix up cpufreq_boost_set_sw()

After commit 18c49926c4bf ("cpufreq: Add QoS requests for userspace
constraints") the return value of freq_qos_update_request(), that can
be 1, passed by cpufreq_boost_set_sw() to its caller sometimes
confuses the latter, which only expects to see 0 or negative error
codes, so notice that cpufreq_boost_set_sw() can return an error code
(which should not be -EINVAL for that matter) as soon as the first
policy without a frequency table is found (because either all policies
have a frequency table or none of them have it) and rework it to meet
its caller's expectations.
