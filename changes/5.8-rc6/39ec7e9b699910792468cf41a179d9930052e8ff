ASoC: mmp-sspa: Set appropriate bus format for given bit width

The values set by set_dai_fmt() and hw_params() seem to be tailored only
for 32-bit formats. Negotiate the correct ones in hw_params() callback
instead.

This was essentially copied from the OLPC kernel driver and tested to
fix wrong audio output for non-32bit formats. The documentation is not
available.
