selinux: store role transitions in a hash table

Currently, they are stored in a linked list, which adds significant
overhead to security_transition_sid(). On Fedora, with 428 role
transitions in policy, converting this list to a hash table cuts down
its run time by about 50%. This was measured by running 'stress-ng --msg
1 --msg-ops 100000' under perf with and without this patch.
