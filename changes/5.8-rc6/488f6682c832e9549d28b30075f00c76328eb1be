block: blk-crypto-fallback for Inline Encryption

Blk-crypto delegates crypto operations to inline encryption hardware
when available. The separately configurable blk-crypto-fallback contains
a software fallback to the kernel crypto API - when enabled, blk-crypto
will use this fallback for en/decryption when inline encryption hardware
is not available.

This lets upper layers not have to worry about whether or not the
underlying device has support for inline encryption before deciding to
specify an encryption context for a bio. It also allows for testing
without actual inline encryption hardware - in particular, it makes it
possible to test the inline encryption code in ext4 and f2fs simply by
running xfstests with the inlinecrypt mount option, which in turn allows
for things like the regular upstream regression testing of ext4 to cover
the inline encryption code paths.
