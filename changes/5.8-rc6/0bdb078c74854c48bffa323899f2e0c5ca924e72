net/mlx5e: Pass only eseg to IPSEC offload

IPSEC offload needs to modify the eseg of the WQE that is being filled,
but it receives a pointer to the whole WQE. To make the contract
stricter, pass only the pointer to the eseg of that WQE. This commit is
preparation for the following refactoring of offloads in the TX path and
for the MPWQE support.
