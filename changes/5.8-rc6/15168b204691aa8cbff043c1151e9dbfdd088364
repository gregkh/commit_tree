media: medium: cec: Make MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT default to n if !MEDIA_SUPPORT

Recently, MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT became indepedent of MEDIA_SUPPORT.
However, if MEDIA_SUPPORT is not enabled, MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER is not
defined, and MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT is thus enabled by default, which is not
desirable.

Fix this by adding a dependency on MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT to the default
configuration.
