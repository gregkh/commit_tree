dm zoned: separate random and cache zones

Instead of lumping emulated zones together with random zones we
should be handling them as separate 'cache' zones. This improves
code readability and allows an easier implementation of different
cache policies.

Also add additional allocation flags, to separate the type (cache,
random, or sequential) from the purpose (eg reclaim).

Also switch the allocation policy to not use random zones as buffer
zones if cache zones are present. This avoids a performance drop when
all cache zones are used.
