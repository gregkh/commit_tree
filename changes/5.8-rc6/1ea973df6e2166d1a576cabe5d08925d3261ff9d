ima: Calculate and extend PCR with digests in ima_template_entry

This patch modifies ima_calc_field_array_hash() to calculate a template
digest for each allocated PCR bank and SHA1. It also passes the tpm_digest
array of the template entry to ima_pcr_extend() or in case of a violation,
the pre-initialized digests array filled with 0xff.

Padding with zeros is still done if the mapping between TPM algorithm ID
and crypto ID is unknown.

This patch calculates again the template digest when a measurement list is
restored. Copying only the SHA1 digest (due to the limitation of the
current measurement list format) is not sufficient, as hash collision
detection will be done on the digest calculated with the IMA default hash
algorithm.
