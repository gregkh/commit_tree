ASoC: tegra-wm8903: Document new nvidia, headset property

Some devices have a 4-pin headset jack instead of 3-pin microphone jack.
The new boolean nvidia,headset property tells that the Mic Jack represents
the state of a headset microphone. This additional hardware description is
needed because microphone detection procedure differs in a case of a 4-pin
jack from a 3-pin jack.
