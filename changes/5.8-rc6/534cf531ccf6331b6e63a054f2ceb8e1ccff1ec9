btrfs: simplify error handling of clean_pinned_extents()

At clean_pinned_extents(), whether we end up returning success or failure,
we pretty much have to do the same things:

1) unlock unused_bg_unpin_mutex
2) decrement reference count on the previous transaction

We also call btrfs_dec_block_group_ro() in case of failure, but that is
better done in its caller, btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), since its the
caller that calls inc_block_group_ro(), so it should be responsible for
the decrement operation, as it is in case any of the other functions it
calls fail.

So move the call to btrfs_dec_block_group_ro() from clean_pinned_extents()
into  btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() and unify the error and success return
paths for clean_pinned_extents(), reducing duplicated code and making it
simpler.
