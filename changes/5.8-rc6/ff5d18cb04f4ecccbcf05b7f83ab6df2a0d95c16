ASoC: tegra: Enable audio mclk during tegra_asoc_utils_init()

Tegra PMC clock clk_out_1 is dedicated for audio mclk from Tegra30
through Tegra210 and currently Tegra clock driver keeps the audio mclk
enabled.

With the move of PMC clocks from clock driver into pmc driver, audio
mclk enable from clock driver is removed and this should be taken care
of by the audio driver.

tegra_asoc_utils_init() calls tegra_asoc_utils_set_rate() and audio mclk
rate configuration is not needed during init and the rate is actually
set during the ->hw_params() callback.

So, this patch removes tegra_asoc_utils_set_rate() call and just leaves
the audio mclk enabled.
