dt-bindings: remoteproc: qcom: Replace halt-nav with spare-regs

7C retail devices using MSA based boot will result in a fuse combination
which will prevent accesses to MSS PERPH register space where the mpss
clocks and halt-nav reside. However accesses to conn_box_spare0 in TCSR
register space is still permitted so rename the binding appropriately to
qcom,spare-regs and drop all accesses to the MPSS PERPH register space.
