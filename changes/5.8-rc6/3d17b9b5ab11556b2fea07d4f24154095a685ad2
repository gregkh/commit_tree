scsi: ufs: Add write booster feature support

The write performance of TLC NAND is considerably lower than SLC NAND.
Using SLC NAND as a WriteBooster Buffer enables the write request to be
processed with lower latency and improves the overall write performance.

Adds support for shared-buffer mode WriteBooster.

WriteBooster enable: SW enables it when clocks are scaled up, thus it's
enabled only in high load conditions.

WriteBooster disable: SW will disable the feature, when clocks are scaled
down. Thus writes would go as normal writes.

To keep the endurance of the WriteBooster Buffer at a maximum, this
load-based toggling is adopted.
