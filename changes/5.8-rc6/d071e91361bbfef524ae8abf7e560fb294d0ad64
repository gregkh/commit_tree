kcsan: Change data_race() to no longer require marking racing accesses

Thus far, accesses marked with data_race() would still require the
racing access to be marked in some way (be it with READ_ONCE(),
WRITE_ONCE(), or data_race() itself), as otherwise KCSAN would still
report a data race.  This requirement, however, seems to be unintuitive,
and some valid use-cases demand *not* marking other accesses, as it
might hide more serious bugs (e.g. diagnostic reads).

Therefore, this commit changes data_race() to no longer require marking
racing accesses (although it's still recommended if possible).

The alternative would have been introducing another variant of
data_race(), however, since usage of data_race() already needs to be
carefully reasoned about, distinguishing between these cases likely adds
more complexity in the wrong place.
