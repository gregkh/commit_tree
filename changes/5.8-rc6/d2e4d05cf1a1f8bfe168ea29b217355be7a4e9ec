modpost: fix potential segmentation fault for addend_i386_rel()

This may not be a practical problem, but the second pass of ARCH=i386
modpost causes segmentation fault if the -s option is not passed.

    MODPOST 12 modules
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  make[2]: *** [scripts/Makefile.modpost:94: __modpost] Error 139
  make[1]: *** [Makefile:1339: modules] Error 2
  make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

The segmentation fault occurs when section_rel() is called for vmlinux,
which is untested in regular builds. The cause of the problem is
reloc_location() returning a wrong pointer for ET_EXEC object type.
In this case, you need to subtract sechdr->sh_addr, otherwise it would
get access beyond the mmap'ed memory.

Add sym_get_data_by_offset() helper to avoid code duplication.
