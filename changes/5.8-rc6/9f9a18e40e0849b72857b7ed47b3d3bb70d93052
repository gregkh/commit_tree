staging: wfx: drop unnecessary condition checks in wfx_upload_ap_templates()

In former code, wfx_upload_ap_templates() was called in more cases
than necessary. Therefore, it tried to not update the frame templates
if it was not necessary.

Now, wfx_upload_ap_templates() is called only if mac80211 asked to
update the templates. In add, it does not hurt to upload template if
they are not used. So, remove unnecessary conditions at beginning of
wfx_upload_ap_templates()
