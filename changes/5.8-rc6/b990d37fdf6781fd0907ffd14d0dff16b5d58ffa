KVM: arm64: Stop sparse from moaning at __hyp_this_cpu_ptr

Sparse complains that __hyp_this_cpu_ptr() returns something
that is flagged noderef and not in the correct address space
(both being the result of the __percpu annotation).

Pretend that __hyp_this_cpu_ptr() knows what it is doing by
forcefully casting the pointer with __kernel __force.
