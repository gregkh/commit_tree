staging: rtl8723bs: os_dep: remove set but not used 'size'

And also remove the NULL check before kfree() because kfree() can handle
NULL pointers correctly.

Fix the following gcc warning:

drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/os_dep/ioctl_cfg80211.c:157:6: warning:
variable ‘size’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  u32 size = 0;
