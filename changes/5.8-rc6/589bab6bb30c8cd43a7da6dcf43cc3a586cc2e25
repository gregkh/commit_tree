cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add one more OOB control bit

Add one more bit for OOB (Out Of Band) enabling of P-states.

If OOB handling of P-states is enabled, intel_pstate shouldn't load.
Currently, only "BIT(8) == 1" of the MSR MSR_MISC_PWR_MGMT is
considered as OOB, but "BIT(18) == 1" needs to be taken into
consideration as OOB condition too.
