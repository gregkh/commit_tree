erofs: suppress false positive last_block warning

As Andrew mentioned, some rare specific gcc versions could report
last_block uninitialized warning. Actually last_block doesn't need
to be uninitialized first from its implementation due to bio == NULL
condition. After a bio is allocated, last_block will be assigned
then.

The detailed analysis is in this thread [1]. So let's silence those
confusing gccs simply.
