modpost: load KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS files in order

Currently, modpost reads extra symbol dump files in the reverse order.
If '-e foo -e bar' is given, modpost reads bar, foo, in this order.

This is probably not a big deal, but there is no good reason to reverse
the order. Read files in the given order.
