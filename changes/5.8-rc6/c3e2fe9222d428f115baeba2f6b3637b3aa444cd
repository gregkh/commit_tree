scsi: scsi_debug: Implement VERIFY(10), add VERIFY(16)

With the addition of the per_host_store option, the ability to check
whether two different ramdisk images are the same or not becomes
practical. Prior to this patch VERIFY(10) always returned true (i.e.  the
SCSI GOOD status) without checking. This option adds support for BYTCHK
equal to 0, 1 and 3. If the comparison fails, then a sense key of
MISCOMPARE is returned as per the T10 standards. Also add support for the
VERIFY(16) command.
