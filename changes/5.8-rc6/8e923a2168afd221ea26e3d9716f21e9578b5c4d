selftests/ftrace: Use printf for backslash included command

Since the built-in echo has different behavior in POSIX shell
(dash) and bash, kprobe_syntax_errors.tc can fail on dash which
interpret backslash escape automatically.

To fix this issue, we explicitly use printf "%s" (not interpret
backslash escapes) if the command string can include backslash.
