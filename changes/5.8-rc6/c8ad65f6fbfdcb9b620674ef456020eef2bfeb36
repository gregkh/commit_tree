w1_therm: fix reset_select_slave during discovery

Fix reset_select_slave issue during devices discovery by the master on
bus. The w1_reset_select_slave() from w1_io.c, which was previously used,
assume that if the slave count is 1 there is only one slave attached on
the bus. This is not always true. For example when discovering devices,
when the first device is discover by the bus master, its slave count is
1, but some other slaves may be on the bus.

In that case instead of adressing command to the attached slave the
master throw a SKIP ROM command so that all slaves attached on the bus
will answer simultenaously causing data collision.

A dedicated reset_select_slave() function is implemented here,
it always perform an adressing to each slave using the MATCH ROM
command.
