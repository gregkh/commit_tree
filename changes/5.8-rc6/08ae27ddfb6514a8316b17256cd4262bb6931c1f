net/smc: delete link processing as SMC server

Add smc_llc_process_srv_delete_link() to process a DELETE_LINK request
as SMC server. When the request is to delete ALL links then terminate
the whole link group. If not, find the link to delete by its link_id,
send the DELETE_LINK request LLC message and wait for the response.
No matter if a response was received, clear the deleted link and update
the link group state.
