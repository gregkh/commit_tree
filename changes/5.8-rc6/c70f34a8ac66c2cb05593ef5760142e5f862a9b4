bpf: Fix bpf_iter's task iterator logic

task_seq_get_next might stop prematurely if get_pid_task() fails to get
task_struct. Failure to do so doesn't mean that there are no more tasks with
higher pids. Procfs's iteration algorithm (see next_tgid in fs/proc/base.c)
does a retry in such case. After this fix, instead of stopping prematurely
after about 300 tasks on my server, bpf_iter program now returns >4000, which
sounds much closer to reality.
