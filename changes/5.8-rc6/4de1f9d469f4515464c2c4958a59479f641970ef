KVM: VMX: Don't reload APIC access page if its control is disabled

Don't reload the APIC access page if its control is disabled, e.g. if
the guest is running with x2APIC (likely) or with the local APIC
disabled (unlikely), to avoid unnecessary TLB flushes and VMWRITEs.
Unconditionally reload the APIC access page and flush the TLB when
the guest's virtual APIC transitions to "xAPIC enabled", as any
changes to the APIC access page's mapping will not be recorded while
the guest's virtual APIC is disabled.
