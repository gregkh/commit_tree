media: s5p-mfc: Properly handle dma_parms for the allocated devices

Commit 9495b7e92f71 ("driver core: platform: Initialize dma_parms for
platform devices") in v5.7-rc5 added allocation of dma_parms structure to
all platform devices. Then vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() have been
changed not to allocate dma_parms structure and rely on the one allocated
by the device core. Lets allocate the needed structure also for the
devices created for the 2 MFC device memory ports.
