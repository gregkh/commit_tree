ASoC: core: only convert non DPCM link to DPCM link

Additional checks for valid DAIs expose a corner case, where existing
BE dailinks get modified, e.g. HDMI links are tagged with
dpcm_capture=1 even if the DAIs are for playback.

This patch makes those changes conditional and flags configuration
issues when a BE dailink is has no_pcm=0 but dpcm_playback or
dpcm_capture=1 (which makes no sense).

As discussed on the alsa-devel mailing list, there are redundant flags
for dpcm_playback, dpcm_capture, playback_only, capture_only. This
will have to be cleaned-up in a future update. For now only correct
and flag problematic configurations.
