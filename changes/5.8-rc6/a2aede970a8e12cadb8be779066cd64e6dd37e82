scsi: scsi_debug: Improve command duration calculation

Previously the code did the work implied by the given SCSI command and
after that it waited for a timer based on the user specified command
duration to be exhausted before informing the mid-level that the command
was complete. For short command durations, the time to complete the work
implied by the SCSI command could be significant compared to the user
specified command duration.

For example a WRITE of 128 blocks (say 512 bytes each) on a machine that
can copy from main memory to main memory at a rate of 10 GB/sec will take
around 6.4 microseconds to do that copy.  If the user specified a command
duration of 5 microseconds (ndelay=5000), should the driver do a further
delay of 5 microseconds after the copy or return immediately because 6.4 >
5 ?

The action prior to this patch was to always do the timer based
delay. After this patch, for ndelay values less than 1 millisecond, this
driver will complete the command immediately.  And in the case where the
user specified delay was 7 microseconds, a timer delay of 600 nanoseconds
will be set ((7 - 6.4) * 1000).
