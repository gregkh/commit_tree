USB: gadget: udc: s3c2410_udc: Remove pointless NULL check in s3c2410_udc_nuke

Clang warns:

drivers/usb/gadget/udc/s3c2410_udc.c:255:11: warning: comparison of
address of 'ep->queue' equal to a null pointer is always false
[-Wtautological-pointer-compare]
        if (&ep->queue == NULL)
             ~~~~^~~~~    ~~~~
1 warning generated.

It is not wrong, queue is not a pointer so if ep is not NULL, the
address of queue cannot be NULL. No other driver does a check like this
and this check has been around since the driver was first introduced,
presumably with no issues so it does not seem like this check should be
something else. Just remove it.

Commit afe956c577b2d ("kbuild: Enable -Wtautological-compare") exposed
this but it is not the root cause of the warning.
