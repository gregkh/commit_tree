iommu: Don't call .probe_finalize() under group->mutex

The .probe_finalize() call-back of some IOMMU drivers calls into
arm_iommu_attach_device(). This function will call back into the
IOMMU core code, where it tries to take group->mutex again, resulting
in a deadlock.

As there is no reason why .probe_finalize() needs to be called under
that mutex, move it after the lock has been released to fix the
deadlock.
