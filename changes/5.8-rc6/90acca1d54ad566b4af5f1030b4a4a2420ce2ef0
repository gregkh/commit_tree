soundwire: bus_type: introduce sdw_slave_type and sdw_master_type

this is a preparatory patch before the introduction of the
sdw_master_type. The SoundWire slave support is slightly modified with
the use of a sdw_slave_type, and the uevent handling move to
slave.c (since it's not necessary for the master).

No functionality change other than moving code around.
