w1_therm: adding alarm sysfs entry

Adding device alarms settings by a dedicated sysfs entry alarms (RW):
read or write TH and TL in the device RAM. Checking devices in alarm
state could be performed using the master search command.

As alarms temperature level are store in a 8 bit register on the device
and are signed values, a safe cast shall be performed using the min and
max temperature that device are able to measure. This is done by
int_to_short inline function.

A 'write_data' field is added in the device structure, to bind the
correct writing function, as some devices may have 2 or 3 bytes RAM.

Updating Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-w1_therm accordingly.
