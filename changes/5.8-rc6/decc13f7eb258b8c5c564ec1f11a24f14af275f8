svcrdma: Displayed remote IP address should match stored address

Clean up: After commit 1e091c3bbf51 ("svcrdma: Ignore source port
when computing DRC hash"), the IP address stored in xpt_remote
always has a port number of zero. Thus, there's no need to display
the port number when displaying the IP address of a remote NFS/RDMA
client.
