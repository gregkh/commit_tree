net: qede: optional hw recovery procedure

Driver has an ability to initiate a recovery process as a reaction to
detected errors. But the codepath (recovery_process) was disabled and
never active.

Here we add ethtool private flag to allow user have the recovery
procedure activated.

We still do not enable this by default though, since in some configurations
this is not desirable. E.g. this may impact other PFs/VFs.
