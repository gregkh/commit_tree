remoteproc: sysmon: Inform current rproc about all active rprocs

Clients/services running on a remoteproc that booted up might need to be
aware of the state of already running remoteprocs. When a remoteproc boots
up (fresh or after recovery) it is not aware of the remoteprocs that booted
before it, i.e., the system state is incomplete. So to keep track of it we
send sysmon on behalf of all 'ONLINE' remoteprocs.
