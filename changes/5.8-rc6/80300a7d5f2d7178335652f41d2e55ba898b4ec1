spi: spi-mem: Fix Dual/Quad modes on Octal-capable devices

Currently buswidths 2 and 4 are rejected for a device that advertises
Octal capabilities.  Allow these buswidths, just like is done for
buswidth 2 and Quad-capable devices.

Fixes: b12a084c8729ef42 ("spi: spi-mem: add support for octal mode I/O data transfer")
