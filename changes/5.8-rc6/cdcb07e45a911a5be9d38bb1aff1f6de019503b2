ARM: 8975/1: module: fix handling of unwind init sections

Unwind information for init sections is placed in .ARM.exidx.init.text
and .ARM.extab.init.text.  The module core doesn't know that these are
init sections so they are allocated along with the core sections, and if
the core and init sections get allocated in different memory regions
(which is possible with CONFIG_ARM_MODULE_PLTS=y) and they can't reach
each other, relocation fails:

  final section addresses:
  	...
  	0x7f800000 .init.text
	..
  	0xcbb54078 .ARM.exidx.init.text
	..

 section 16 reloc 0 sym '': relocation 42 out of range (0xcbb54078 ->
 0x7f800000)

Fix this by informing the module core that these sections are init
sections, and by removing the init unwind tables before the module core
frees the init sections.
