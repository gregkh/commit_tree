workqueue: Remove unnecessary kfree() call in rcu_free_wq()

The data structure member "wq->rescuer" was reset to a null pointer
in one if branch. It was passed to a call of the function "kfree"
in the callback function "rcu_free_wq" (which was eventually executed).
The function "kfree" does not perform more meaningful data processing
for a passed null pointer (besides immediately returning from such a call).
Thus delete this function call which became unnecessary with the referenced
software update.
