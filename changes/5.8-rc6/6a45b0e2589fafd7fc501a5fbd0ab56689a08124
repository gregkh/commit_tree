gpiolib: Introduce gpiochip_irqchip_add_domain()

The function connects an IRQ domain to a gpiochip and reuses
gpiochip_to_irq() which is provided by gpiolib.

gpiochip_irqchip_* and regmap_irq partially provide the same
functionality. This function will help to connect just the
minimal functionality of the gpiochip_irqchip which is needed to
work together with regmap-irq.
