mlxsw: spectrum: Avoid copying sample values and use RCU pointer direcly instead

Currently, only the psample_group is accessed using RCU on RX path.
However, it is possible (unlikely) that other sample values get change
during RX processing. Fix this by having the port->sample struct
accessed as RCU pointer, containing all sample values including
psample_group pointer. That avoids extra alloc per-port, copying the
values and the race condition described above.
