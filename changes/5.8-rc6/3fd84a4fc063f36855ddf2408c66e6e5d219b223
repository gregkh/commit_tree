parisc: use -fno-strict-aliasing for decompressor

An experimental patch series of mine reworks how warnings are processed
in Kbuild. A side effect is a new warning about a harmless aliasing
rule violation in an inline function:

In file included from
include/linux/rhashtable-types.h:15:0,
                 from include/linux/ipc.h:7,
                 from include/uapi/linux/sem.h:5,
                 from include/linux/sem.h:5,
                 from include/linux/sched.h:15,
                 from include/linux/uaccess.h:6,
                 from arch/parisc/boot/compressed/misc.c:7:
include/linux/workqueue.h: In function 'work_static':
include/linux/workqueue.h:212:2: warning: dereferencing
type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]
  return *work_data_bits(work) & WORK_STRUCT_STATIC;

Make the decompressor use -fno-strict-aliasing like the rest of
the kernel for consistency, and to ensure this warning never makes
it into a release.
