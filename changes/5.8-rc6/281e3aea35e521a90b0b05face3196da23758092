mips: Add MIPS Warrior P5600 support

This is a MIPS32 Release 5 based IP core with XPA, EVA, dual/quad issue
exec pipes, MMU with two-levels TLB, UCA, MSA, MDU core level features
and system level features like up to six P5600 calculation cores, CM2
with L2 cache, IOCU/IOMMU (though might be unused depending on the
system-specific IP core configuration), GIC, CPC, virtualisation module,
eJTAG and PDtrace.

As being MIPS32 Release 5 based core it provides all the features
available by the CPU_MIPS32_R5 config, while adding a few more like
UCA attribute support, availability of CPU-freq (by means of L2/CM
clock ratio setting), EI/VI GIC modes detection at runtime.

In addition to this if P5600 architecture is enabled modern GNU GCC
provides a specific tuning for P5600 processors with respect to the
classic MIPS32 Release 5. First of all branch-likely avoidance is
activated only when the code is compiled with the speed optimization
(avoidance is always enabled for the pure MIPS32 Release 5
architecture). Secondly the madd/msub avoidance is enabled since
madd/msub utilization isn't profitable due to overhead of getting the
result out of the HI/LO registers. Multiply-accumulate instructions are
activated and utilized together with the necessary code reorder when
multiply-add/multiply-subtract statements are met. Finally load/store
bonding is activated by default. All of these optimizations may make
the code relatively faster than if just MIP32 release 5 architecture
was requested.
