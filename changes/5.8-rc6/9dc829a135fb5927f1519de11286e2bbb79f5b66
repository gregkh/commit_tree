drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Fixed the value of hard_header_len

When this driver transmits data,
  first this driver will remove a pseudo header of 1 byte,
  then the lapb module will prepend the LAPB header of 2 or 3 bytes,
  then this driver will prepend a length field of 2 bytes,
  then the underlying Ethernet device will prepend its own header.

So, the header length required should be:
  -1 + 3 + 2 + "the header length needed by the underlying device".

This patch fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF_PACKET
SOCK_DGRAM sockets.
