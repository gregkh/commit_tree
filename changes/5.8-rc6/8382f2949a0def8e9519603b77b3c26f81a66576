ASoC: Intel: broadwell: Fix oops during module removal

When removing the SOF module, the RT286 jack detect
handler will oops if jack detection is not disabled.
Disable the jack in the machine driver remove callback
to prevent this. This fix is only for SOF support and is
not needed for earlier versions.
