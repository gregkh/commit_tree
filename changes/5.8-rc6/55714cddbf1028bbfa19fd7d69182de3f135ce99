KVM: nSVM: Move SMI vmexit handling to svm_check_nested_events()

Unlike VMX, SVM allows a hypervisor to take a SMI vmexit without having
any special SMM-monitor enablement sequence.  Therefore, it has to be
handled like interrupts and NMIs.  Check for an unblocked SMI in
svm_check_nested_events() so that pending SMIs are correctly prioritized
over IRQs and NMIs when the latter events will trigger VM-Exit.

Note that there is no need to test explicitly for SMI vmexits, because
guests always runs outside SMM and therefore can never get an SMI while
they are blocked.
