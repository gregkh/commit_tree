staging: wfx: simplify handling of beacon filter during join process

When the device joins an AP, beacon are forwarded to the host. Once has
retrieved all necessary parameters, we can start to filter the beacon
(and only beacon with changed/new data will be forwarded).

Currently, the driver detect beacons in data Rx process. It is far more
easier to just wait for the BSS_CHANGED_BEACON_INFO event.
