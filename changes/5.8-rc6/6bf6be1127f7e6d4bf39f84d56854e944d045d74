e1000e: Do not wake up the system via WOL if device wakeup is disabled

Currently the system will be woken up via WOL(Wake On LAN) even if the
device wakeup ability has been disabled via sysfs:
 cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.6/power/wakeup
 disabled

The system should not be woken up if the user has explicitly
disabled the wake up ability for this device.

This patch clears the WOL ability of this network device if the
user has disabled the wake up ability in sysfs.
