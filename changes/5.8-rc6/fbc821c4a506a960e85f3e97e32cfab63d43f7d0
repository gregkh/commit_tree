drm/mst: Support simultaneous down replies

Currently we have one down reply message servicing the mst manager, so
we need to serialize all tx msgs to ensure we only have one message in
flight at a time. For obvious reasons this is suboptimal (but less
suboptimal than the free-for-all we had before serialization).

This patch removes the single down_rep_recv message from manager and
adds 2 replies in the branch structure. The 2 replies mirrors the tx_slots
which we use to rate-limit outgoing messages and correspond to seqno in
the packet headers.
