watchdog: iTCO: fix link error

When the MFD driver is a loadable module, the watchdog driver fails
to get linked into the kernel:

drivers/watchdog/iTCO_wdt.o: In function `update_no_reboot_bit_pmc':
iTCO_wdt.c:(.text+0x54f): undefined reference to `intel_pmc_gcr_update'

The code is written to support operation without the MFD driver, so
add a Kconfig dependency that allows this, while disallowing the watchdog
to be built-in when the MFD driver is a module.
