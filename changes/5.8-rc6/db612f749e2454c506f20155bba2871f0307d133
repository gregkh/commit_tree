xdp: Cpumap redirect use frame_sz and increase skb_tailroom

Knowing the memory size backing the packet/xdp_frame data area, and
knowing it already have reserved room for skb_shared_info, simplifies
using build_skb significantly.

With this change we no-longer lie about the SKB truesize, but more
importantly a significant larger skb_tailroom is now provided, e.g. when
drivers uses a full PAGE_SIZE. This extra tailroom (in linear area) can be
used by the network stack when coalescing SKBs (e.g. in skb_try_coalesce,
see TCP cases where tcp_queue_rcv() can 'eat' skb).
