drm/i915/execlists: Pull tasklet interrupt-bh local to direct submission

We dropped calling process_csb prior to handling direct submission in
order to avoid the nesting of spinlocks and lift process_csb() and the
majority of the tasklet out of irq-off. However, we do want to avoid
ksoftirqd latency in the fast path, so try and pull the interrupt-bh
local to direct submission if we can acquire the tasklet's lock.

v2: Document the read of pending[0] from outside the tasklet with
READ_ONCE.
