platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Split out SCU IPC functionality from the SCU driver

The SCU IPC functionality is usable outside of Intel MID devices. For
example modern Intel CPUs include the same thing but now it is called
PMC (Power Management Controller) instead of SCU. To make the IPC
available for those split the driver into core part (intel_scu_ipc.c)
and the SCU PCI driver part (intel_scu_pcidrv.c) which then calls the
former before it goes and creates rest of the SCU devices. The SCU IPC
will also register a new class that gets assigned to the device that is
created under the parent PCI device.

We also split the Kconfig symbols so that INTEL_SCU_IPC enables the SCU
IPC library and INTEL_SCU_PCI the SCU driver and convert the users
accordingly. While there remove default y from the INTEL_SCU_PCI symbol
as it is already selected by X86_INTEL_MID.
