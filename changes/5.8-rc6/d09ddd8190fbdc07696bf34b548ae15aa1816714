PCI: Allow pci_resize_resource() for devices on root bus

When resizing a BAR, pci_reassign_bridge_resources() is invoked to bring
the bridge windows of parent bridges in line with the new BAR assignment.

This assumes the device whose BAR is being resized lives on a subordinate
bus, but this is not necessarily the case. A device may live on the root
bus, in which case dev->bus->self is NULL, and passing a NULL pci_dev
pointer to pci_reassign_bridge_resources() will cause it to crash.

So let's make the call to pci_reassign_bridge_resources() conditional on
whether dev->bus->self is non-NULL in the first place.
