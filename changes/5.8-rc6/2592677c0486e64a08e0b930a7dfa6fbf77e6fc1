ima: Use ima_hash_algo for collision detection in the measurement list

Before calculating a digest for each PCR bank, collisions were detected
with a SHA1 digest. This patch includes ima_hash_algo among the algorithms
used to calculate the template digest and checks collisions on that digest.

The position in the measurement entry array of the template digest
calculated with the IMA default hash algorithm is stored in the
ima_hash_algo_idx global variable and is determined at IMA initialization
time.
