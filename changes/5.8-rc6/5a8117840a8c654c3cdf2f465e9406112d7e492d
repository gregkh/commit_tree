ASoC: amd :High hw_level while simultaneous capture

Simultaneous capture on dmic and headset mic is having
issue with high hw_level being reported.

Issue Can be reproduced by:
arecord -D hw:2,0 -f dat -d 60 /tmp/test0 &
arecord -D hw:2,2 -f dat -d 60 /tmp/test1 &
cat /proc/asound/card2/pcm?c/sub0/status

Actual issue is :
When we open one capture stream on one instance lets say I2S_SP and then
once again if we open other capture on other instance lets say I2S_BT while
first capture is in progress and when we try to read the status of both
running instances by below command cat /proc/asound/card2/pcm?c/sub0/status
we observe that avail_max is being doubled on first opened
capture(I2S_SP in the example).

This is because our previous implementation was like when any instance is
opened it gets initialized in dma_open irrespective of on what instance it
called open.

For example:
First I2S_SP called opened it initializes both SP/BT capture streams
irrespective of on which instance the stream opened.next time I2S_BT
called opened and it initializes both SP/BT this corrupts the behaviour .

So with this patch the stream gets initialized only on specific instance
when ever it gets opened calls hw_params.

This rectifies the issue.
