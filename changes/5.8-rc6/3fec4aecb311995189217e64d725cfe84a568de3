kgdb: Fix spurious true from in_dbg_master()

Currently there is a small window where a badly timed migration could
cause in_dbg_master() to spuriously return true. Specifically if we
migrate to a new core after reading the processor id and the previous
core takes a breakpoint then we will evaluate true if we read
kgdb_active before we get the IPI to bring us to halt.

Fix this by checking irqs_disabled() first. Interrupts are always
disabled when we are executing the kgdb trap so this is an acceptable
prerequisite. This also allows us to replace raw_smp_processor_id()
with smp_processor_id() since the short circuit logic will prevent
warnings from PREEMPT_DEBUG.
