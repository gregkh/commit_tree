arm64: Depend on newer binutils when building PAC

Versions of binutils prior to 2.33.1 don't understand the ELF notes that
are added by modern compilers to indicate the PAC and BTI options used
to build the code. This causes them to emit large numbers of warnings in
the form:

aarch64-linux-gnu-nm: warning: .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2: unsupported GNU_PROPERTY_TYPE (5) type: 0xc0000000

during the kernel build which is currently causing quite a bit of
disruption for automated build testing using clang.

In commit 15cd0e675f3f76b (arm64: Kconfig: ptrauth: Add binutils version
check to fix mismatch) we added a dependency on binutils to avoid this
issue when building with versions of GCC that emit the notes but did not
do so for clang as it was believed that the existing check for
.cfi_negate_ra_state was already requiring a new enough binutils. This
does not appear to be the case for some versions of binutils (eg, the
binutils in Debian 10) so instead refactor so we require a new enough
GNU binutils in all cases other than when we are using an old GCC
version that does not emit notes.

Other, more exotic, combinations of tools are possible such as using
clang, lld and gas together are possible and may have further problems
but rather than adding further version checks it looks like the most
robust thing will be to just test that we can build cleanly with the
configured tools but that will require more review and discussion so do
this for now to address the immediate problem disrupting build testing.
