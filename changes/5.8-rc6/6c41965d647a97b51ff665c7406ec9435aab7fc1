RDMA/mlx5: Don't access ib_qp fields in internal destroy QP path

destroy_qp_common is called for flows where QP is already created by
HW. While it is called from IB/core, the ibqp.* fields will be fully
initialized, but it is not the case if this function is called during QP
creation.

Don't rely on ibqp fields as much as possible and initialize
send_cq/recv_cq as temporal solution till all drivers will be converted to
IB/core QP allocation scheme.

refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
