net: stmmac: dwmac-meson8b: Add the PRG_ETH0_ADJ_* bits

The PRG_ETH0_ADJ_* are used for applying the RGMII RX delay. The public
datasheets only have very limited description for these registers, but
Jianxin Pan provided more detailed documentation from an (unnamed)
Amlogic engineer. Add the PRG_ETH0_ADJ_* bits along with the improved
description.
