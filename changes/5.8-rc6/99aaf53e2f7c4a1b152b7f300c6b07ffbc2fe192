tools/bpf: selftests : Explain bpf_iter test failures with llvm 10.0.0

Commit 6879c042e105 ("tools/bpf: selftests: Add bpf_iter selftests")
added self tests for bpf_iter feature. But two subtests
ipv6_route and netlink needs llvm latest 10.x release branch
or trunk due to a bug in llvm BPF backend. This patch added
the file README.rst to document these two failures
so people using llvm 10.0.0 can be aware of them.
