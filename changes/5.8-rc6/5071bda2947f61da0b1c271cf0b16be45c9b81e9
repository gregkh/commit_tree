iavf: use appropriate enum for comparison

adapter->link_speed has type enum virtchnl_link_speed but our comparisons
are against enum iavf_aq_link_speed. Though they are, currently, the same
values, change the comparison to the matching enum virtchnl_link_speed
since that may not always be the case.
