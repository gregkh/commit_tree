drm/i915: do AUD_FREQ_CNTRL state save on all gen9+ platforms

Replace the TGL/ICL specific platform checks with a more generic check
using INTEL_GEN(). Fixes bug with broken audio after S3 resume on JSL
platforms.

An initial version of state save and restore of AUD_FREQ_CNTRL register
was added for subset of platforms in commit 87c1694533c9
("drm/i915: save AUD_FREQ_CNTRL state at audio domain suspend"). The state
save has proven to work well and it is needed in newer platforms, so needs
to be extended. Although the logic is not in practise needed on GEN9/10
systems, follow the hardware specification and apply state and restore on
all gen9+ platforms.
