selftests/exec: Add binfmt_script regression test

While working on commit b5372fe5dc84 ("exec: load_script: Do not exec
truncated interpreter path"), I wrote a series of test scripts to verify
corner cases. However, soon after, commit 6eb3c3d0a52d ("exec: increase
BINPRM_BUF_SIZE to 256") landed, resulting in the tests needing to be
refactored for the larger BINPRM_BUF_SIZE, which got lost on my TODO
list. During the recent exec refactoring work[1], the need for these tests
resurfaced, so I've finished them up for addition to the kernel selftests.
