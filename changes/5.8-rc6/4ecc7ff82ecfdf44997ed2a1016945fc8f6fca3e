pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7790: Add r8a7742 PFC support

Renesas RZ/G1H (R8A7742) is pin compatible with R-Car H2 (R8A7790),
however it doesn't have several automotive specific peripherals. Add
automotive-specific pin groups/functions along with common pin
groups/functions for supporting both r8a7790 and r8a7742 SoC.
