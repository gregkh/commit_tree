btrfs: open code key_search

This function wraps the optimisation implemented by d7396f07358a
("Btrfs: optimize key searches in btrfs_search_slot") however this
optimisation is really used in only one place - btrfs_search_slot.

Just open code the optimisation and also add a comment explaining how it
works since it's not clear just by looking at the code - the key point
here is it depends on an internal invariant that BTRFS' btree provides,
namely intermediate pointers always contain the key at slot0 at the
child node. So in the case of exact match we can safely assume that the
given key will always be in slot 0 on lower levels.

Furthermore this results in a reduction of btrfs_search_slot's size:

./scripts/bloat-o-meter ctree.orig fs/btrfs/ctree.o
add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/1 up/down: 0/-75 (-75)

btrfs_search_slot                           2783    2708     -75
Total: Before=50423, After=50348, chg -0.15%
