staging: wfx: ensure that probe requests are filtered when AP

Device is able to automatically reply to probe request (therefore, the
probe requests are not forwarded to host). This feature is enabled by
wfx_start_ap(). However, further calls to wfx_configure_filter() can
disable it.

So, relocate the handling of probe request filtering in
wfx_configure_filter().

Note that wfx_configure_filter() is always called by mac80211 when an AP
start.
