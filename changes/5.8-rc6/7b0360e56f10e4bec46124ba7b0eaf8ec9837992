staging: wfx: simplify hif_set_bss_params()

The structure hif_req_set_bss_params come from hardware API. It is not
intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

In add, current code for hif_req_set_bss_params() is too dumb. It should
pack data with hardware representation instead of leaving all work to
the caller.
