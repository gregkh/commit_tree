dt-bindings: opp: Introduce opp-peak-kBps and opp-avg-kBps bindings

Interconnects often quantify their performance points in terms of
bandwidth. So, add opp-peak-kBps (required) and opp-avg-kBps (optional) to
allow specifying Bandwidth OPP tables in DT.

opp-peak-kBps is a required property that replaces opp-hz for Bandwidth OPP
tables.

opp-avg-kBps is an optional property that can be used in Bandwidth OPP
tables.
