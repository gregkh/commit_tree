irqchip/gic-v2, v3: Drop extra IRQ_NOAUTOEN setting for (E)PPIs

(E)PPIs are per-CPU interrupts, so we want each CPU to go and enable them
via enable_percpu_irq(); this also means we want IRQ_NOAUTOEN for them as
the autoenable would lead to calling irq_enable() instead of the more
appropriate irq_percpu_enable().

Calling irq_set_percpu_devid() is enough to get just that since it trickles
down to irq_set_percpu_devid_flags(), which gives us IRQ_NOAUTOEN (and a
few others). Setting IRQ_NOAUTOEN *again* right after this call is just
redundant, so don't do it.
