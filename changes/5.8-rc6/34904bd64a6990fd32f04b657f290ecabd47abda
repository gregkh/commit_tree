drm/i915/debugfs: move uC printers and update debugfs file names

Move the printers to the respective files for clarity. The
guc_load_status debugfs has been squashed in the guc_info one, has
having separate ones wasn't very useful. The HuC debugfs has been
renamed huc_info to match.

v2: keep printing HUC_STATUS2 (Tony), avoid const->non-const
    container_of (Jani)
