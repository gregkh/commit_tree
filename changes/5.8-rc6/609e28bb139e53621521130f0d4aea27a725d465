pstore: Remove filesystem records when backend is unregistered

If a backend was unloaded without having first removed all its
associated records in pstorefs, subsequent removals would crash while
attempting to call into the now missing backend. Add automatic removal
from the tree in pstore_unregister(), so that no references to the
backend remain.
