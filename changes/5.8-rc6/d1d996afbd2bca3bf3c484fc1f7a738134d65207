tty: serial: imx: clear Ageing Timer Interrupt in handler

The AGTIM flag must be cleared explicitly, otherwise the IRQ handler
will be called in an endless loop.

Fortunately, this issue currently doesn't affect mainline kernels in
practice, as the the RX FIFO trigger level is set to 1 in UFCR. When
setting the trigger level to a higher number, the issue is trivially
reproducible by any RX without DMA that doesn't fill the FIFO up to the
configured level.
