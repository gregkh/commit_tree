w1_therm: adding eeprom sysfs entry

The driver implement 2 hardware functions to access device RAM:
 * copy_scratchpad
 * recall_scratchpad
They act according to device specifications.

As EEPROM operations are not device dependent (all w1_therm can perform
EEPROM read/write operation following the same protocol), it is removed
from device families structures.

Updating Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-w1_therm accordingly.
