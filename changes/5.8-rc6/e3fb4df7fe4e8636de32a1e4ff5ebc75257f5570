modpost: re-add -e to set external_module flag

Previously, the -i option had two functions; load a symbol dump file,
and set the external_module flag.

I want to assign a dedicate option for each of them.

Going forward, the -i is used to load a symbol dump file, and the -e
to set the external_module flag.

With this, we will be able to use -i for loading in-kernel symbols.
