ovl: return required buffer size for file handles

Overlayfs doesn't work well with the fanotify mechanism.

Fanotify first probes for the required buffer size for the file handle,
but overlayfs currently bails out without passing the size back.

That results in errors in the kernel log, such as:

[527944.485384] overlayfs: failed to encode file handle (/, err=-75, buflen=0, len=29, type=1)
[527944.485386] fanotify: failed to encode fid (fsid=ae521e68.a434d95f, type=255, bytes=0, err=-2)
