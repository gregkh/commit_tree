KVM: nVMX: Skip IBPB when switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02

Skip the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier that is triggered on a VMCS
switch when running with spectre_v2_user=on/auto if the switch is
between two VMCSes in the same guest, i.e. between vmcs01 and vmcs02.
The IBPB is intended to prevent one guest from attacking another, which
is unnecessary in the nested case as it's the same guest from KVM's
perspective.

This all but eliminates the overhead observed for nested VMX transitions
when running with CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y and spectre_v2_user=on/auto, which
can be significant, e.g. roughly 3x on current systems.
