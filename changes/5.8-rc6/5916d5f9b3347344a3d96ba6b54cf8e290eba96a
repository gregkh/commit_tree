bug: Annotate WARN/BUG/stackfail as noinstr safe

Warnings, bugs and stack protection fails from noinstr sections, e.g. low
level and early entry code, are likely to be fatal.

Mark them as "safe" to be invoked from noinstr protected code to avoid
annotating all usage sites. Getting the information out is important.
