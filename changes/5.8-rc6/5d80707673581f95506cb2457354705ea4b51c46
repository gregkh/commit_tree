scsi: scsi_debug: Re-arrange parameters alphabetically

This module has a lot of parameters and when searching for one, the author
prefers them in alphabetical order. This can lead to somewhat illogical
ordering (e.g. inq_product before inq_vendor). However it is not clear what
another sensible total logical ordering would be.
