btrfs: clarify btrfs_lookup_bio_sums documentation

Fix a couple of issues in the btrfs_lookup_bio_sums documentation:

* The bio doesn't need to be a btrfs_io_bio if dst was provided. Move
  the declaration in the code to make that clear, too.
* dst must be large enough to hold nblocks * csum_size, not just
  csum_size.
