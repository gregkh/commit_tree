Input: edt-ft5x06 - improve power management operations

It is possible to bring the device into a deep sleep state. To exit this
state the reset or wakeup pin must be toggeled as documented in [1].
Because of the poor documentation I used the several downstream kernels
[2] and other applications notes [3] to indentify the related registers.

Furthermore I added the support to disable the device completely which
is obviously the most effective power-saving mechanism. This mechanism
needs the reset pin to ensure the power-up/down sequence.

We can't apply any of these power-saving mechanism if both pins are
missing (not connected) or if it is a wakeup device.
