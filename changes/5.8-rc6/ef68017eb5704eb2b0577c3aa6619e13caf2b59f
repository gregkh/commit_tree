x86/kvm: Handle async page faults directly through do_page_fault()

KVM overloads #PF to indicate two types of not-actually-page-fault
events.  Right now, the KVM guest code intercepts them by modifying
the IDT and hooking the #PF vector.  This makes the already fragile
fault code even harder to understand, and it also pollutes call
traces with async_page_fault and do_async_page_fault for normal page
faults.

Clean it up by moving the logic into do_page_fault() using a static
branch.  This gets rid of the platform trap_init override mechanism
completely.

[ tglx: Fixed up 32bit, removed error code from the async functions and
  	massaged coding style ]
