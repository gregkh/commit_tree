bcache: Convert pr_<level> uses to a more typical style

Remove the trailing newline from the define of pr_fmt and add newlines
to the uses.

Miscellanea:

o Convert bch_bkey_dump from multiple uses of pr_err to pr_cont
  as the earlier conversion was inappropriate done causing multiple
  lines to be emitted where only a single output line was desired
o Use vsprintf extension %pV in bch_cache_set_error to avoid multiple
  line output where only a single line output was desired
o Coalesce formats

Fixes: 6ae63e3501c4 ("bcache: replace printk() by pr_*() routines")
