drm/amd/display: add optc get crc support for timings with ODM/DSC

[why]
Optc needs to know if timing is enabled with ODM or DSC before computing
crc.  Otherwise value computed will be inaccurate. Before this change,
the CRC computed without ODM is not equal to the CRC computed with ODM
for the same timing. This is unexpected as we are driving the same
timing despite of the underlaying hardware setup to achieve it. This is
caused by missing hardware programming sequence to support it.

[how]
Add the new programming sequence based on hardware guide.
