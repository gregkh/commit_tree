ath11k: remove stale monitor status descriptor

The driver is not handling monitor status descriptor whenever
the done bit of status descriptor is not set by hardware. This leave
a stale entry in monitor status ring and flooding warning message.
Fix that by removing the descriptor and move forward to next one
in monitor status ring.
