drm: encoder_slave: use new I2C API

i2c_new_client() is deprecated, use the replacement
i2c_new_client_device(). Also, we have a helper to check if a driver is
bound. Use it to simplify the code. Note that this changes the errno for
a failed device creation from ENOMEM to ENODEV. No callers currently
interpret this errno, though, so we use this condensed error check.
