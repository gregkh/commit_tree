net: phy: make phy_disable_interrupts() non-static

We face an issue with rtl8211f, a pin is shared between INTB and PMEB,
and the PHY Register Accessible Interrupt is enabled by default, so
the INTB/PMEB pin is always active in polling mode case.

As Heiner pointed out "I was thinking about calling
phy_disable_interrupts() in phy_init_hw(), to have a defined init
state as we don't know in which state the PHY is if the PHY driver is
loaded. We shouldn't assume that it's the chip power-on defaults, BIOS
or boot loader could have changed this. Or in case of dual-boot
systems the other OS could leave the PHY in whatever state."

Make phy_disable_interrupts() non-static so that it could be used in
phy_init_hw() to have a defined init state.
