staging: wfx: drop useless attribute 'filter_mcast'

Currently, wfx_update_filtering() apply the value of wvif->filter_mcast
to the hardware. But an attentive reader will note that
wfx_update_filtering() is always called after set wvif->filter_mcast.
Thus, it not necessary to store filter_mcast in the struct wfx_vif. We
can just pass it as parameter.

Also rename wfx_update_filtering() in wfx_filter_mcast() to reflect this
change.
