xfrm: remove output_finish indirection from xfrm_state_afinfo

There are only two implementaions, one for ipv4 and one for ipv6.

Both are almost identical, they clear skb->cb[], set the TRANSFORMED flag
in IP(6)CB and then call the common xfrm_output() function.

By placing the IPCB handling into the common function, we avoid the need
for the output_finish indirection as the output functions can simply
use xfrm_output().
