KVM: arm64: Flush the instruction cache if not unmapping the VM on reboot

On a system with FWB, we don't need to unmap Stage-2 on reboot,
as even if userspace takes this opportunity to repaint the whole
of memory, FWB ensures that the data side stays consistent even
if the guest uses non-cacheable mappings.

However, the I-side is not necessarily coherent with the D-side
if CTR_EL0.DIC is 0. In this case, invalidate the i-cache to
preserve coherency.
