xfs: always return -ENOSPC on project quota reservation failure

XFS project quota treats project hierarchies as "mini filesysems" and
so rather than -EDQUOT, the intent is to return -ENOSPC when a quota
reservation fails, but this behavior is not consistent.

The only place we make a decision between -EDQUOT and -ENOSPC
returns based on quota type is in xfs_trans_dqresv().

This behavior is currently controlled by whether or not the
XFS_QMOPT_ENOSPC flag gets passed into the quota reservation.  However,
its use is not consistent; paths such as xfs_create() and xfs_symlink()
don't set the flag, so a reservation failure will return -EDQUOT for
project quota reservation failures rather than -ENOSPC for these sorts
of operations, even for project quota:

# mkdir mnt/project
# xfs_quota -x -c "project -s -p mnt/project 42" mnt
# xfs_quota -x -c 'limit -p isoft=2 ihard=3 42' mnt
# touch mnt/project/file{1,2,3}
touch: cannot touch ‘mnt/project/file3’: Disk quota exceeded

We can make this consistent by not requiring the flag to be set at the
top of the callchain; instead we can simply test whether we are
reserving a project quota with XFS_QM_ISPDQ in xfs_trans_dqresv and if
so, return -ENOSPC for that failure.  This removes the need for the
XFS_QMOPT_ENOSPC altogether and simplifies the code a fair bit.
