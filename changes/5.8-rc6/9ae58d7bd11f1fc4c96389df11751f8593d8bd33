rcu-tasks: Add Kconfig option to mediate smp_mb() vs. IPI

This commit provides a new TASKS_TRACE_RCU_READ_MB Kconfig option that
enables use of read-side memory barriers by both rcu_read_lock_trace()
and rcu_read_unlock_trace() when the are executed with the
current->trc_reader_special.b.need_mb flag set.  This flag is currently
never set.  Doing that is the subject of a later commit.
