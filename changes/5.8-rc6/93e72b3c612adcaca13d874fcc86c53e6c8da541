squashfs: migrate from ll_rw_block usage to BIO

ll_rw_block() function has been deprecated in favor of BIO which appears
to come with large performance improvements.

This patch decreases boot time by close to 40% when using squashfs for
the root file-system.  This is observed at least in the context of
starting an Android VM on Chrome OS using crosvm.  The patch was tested
on 4.19 as well as master.

This patch is largely based on Adrien Schildknecht's patch that was
originally sent as https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/9/22/814 though with some
significant changes and simplifications while also taking Phillip
Lougher's feedback into account, around preserving support for
FILE_CACHE in particular.
