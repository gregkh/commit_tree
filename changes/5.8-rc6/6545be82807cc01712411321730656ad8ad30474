sfc: fix dereference of table before it is null checked

Currently pointer table is being dereferenced on a null check of
table->must_restore_filters before it is being null checked, leading
to a potential null pointer dereference issue.  Fix this by null
checking table before dereferencing it when checking for a null
table->must_restore_filters.
