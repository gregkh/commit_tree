fs: handle FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC in fiemap_prep

By moving FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC handling to fiemap_prep we ensure it is
handled once instead of duplicated, but can still be done under fs locks,
like xfs/iomap intended with its duplicate handling.  Also make sure the
error value of filemap_write_and_wait is propagated to user space.
