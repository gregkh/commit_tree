KVM: VMX: Use accessor to read vmcs.INTR_INFO when handling exception

Use vmx_get_intr_info() when grabbing the cached vmcs.INTR_INFO in
handle_exception_nmi() to ensure the cache isn't stale.  Bypassing the
caching accessor doesn't cause any known issues as the cache is always
refreshed by handle_exception_nmi_irqoff(), but the whole point of
adding the proper caching mechanism was to avoid such dependencies.
