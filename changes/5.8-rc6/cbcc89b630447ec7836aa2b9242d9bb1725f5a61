gfs2: initialize transaction tr_ailX_lists earlier

Since transactions may be freed shortly after they're created, before
a log_flush occurs, we need to initialize their ail1 and ail2 lists
earlier. Before this patch, the ail1 list was initialized in gfs2_log_flush().
This moves the initialization to the point when the transaction is first
created.
