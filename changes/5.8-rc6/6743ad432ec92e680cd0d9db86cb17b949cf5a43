kprobes: Suppress the suspicious RCU warning on kprobes

Anders reported that the lockdep warns that suspicious
RCU list usage in register_kprobe() (detected by
CONFIG_PROVE_RCU_LIST.) This is because get_kprobe()
access kprobe_table[] by hlist_for_each_entry_rcu()
without rcu_read_lock.

If we call get_kprobe() from the breakpoint handler context,
it is run with preempt disabled, so this is not a problem.
But in other cases, instead of rcu_read_lock(), we locks
kprobe_mutex so that the kprobe_table[] is not updated.
So, current code is safe, but still not good from the view
point of RCU.

Joel suggested that we can silent that warning by passing
lockdep_is_held() to the last argument of
hlist_for_each_entry_rcu().

Add lockdep_is_held(&kprobe_mutex) at the end of the
hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() to suppress the warning.
