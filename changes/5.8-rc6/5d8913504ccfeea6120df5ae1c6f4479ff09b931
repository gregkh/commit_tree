gpio: pca953x: Fix GPIO resource leak on Intel Galileo Gen 2

When adding a quirk for IRQ on Intel Galileo Gen 2 the commit ba8c90c61847
("gpio: pca953x: Override IRQ for one of the expanders on Galileo Gen 2")
missed GPIO resource release. We can safely do this in the same quirk, since
IRQ will be locked by GPIO framework when requested and unlocked on freeing.
