MIPS: VDSO: Allow ld.lld to link the VDSO

Currently, when linking with ld.lld, this warning pops up:

    arch/mips/vdso/Makefile:70: MIPS VDSO requires binutils >= 2.25

CONFIG_LD_VERSION is set with scripts/ld-version.sh, which is specific
to GNU ld. It returns 0 for ld.lld so CONFIG_MIPS_LD_CAN_LINK_VDSO does
not set.

ld.lld has a completely different versioning scheme (as it follows
LLVM's versioning) and it does not have the issue mentioned in the
comment block so it should be allowed to link the VDSO.

With this patch, the VDSO successfully links and shows P_MIPS_PC32 in
vgettimeofday.o.

$ llvm-objdump -Dr arch/mips/vdso/vgettimeofday.o | grep R_MIPS_PC32
			00000024:  R_MIPS_PC32	_start
			000000b0:  R_MIPS_PC32	_start
			000002bc:  R_MIPS_PC32	_start
			0000036c:  R_MIPS_PC32	_start
			00000468:  R_MIPS_PC32	_start
