arm64: Rework ARM_ERRATUM_1414080 handling

The current handling of erratum 1414080 has the side effect that
cntkctl_el1 can get changed for both 32 and 64bit tasks.

This isn't a problem so far, but if we ever need to mitigate another
of these errata on the 64bit side, we'd better keep the messing with
cntkctl_el1 local to 32bit tasks.

For that, make sure that on entering the kernel from a 32bit tasks,
userspace access to cntvct gets enabled, and disabled returning to
userspace, while it never gets changed for 64bit tasks.
