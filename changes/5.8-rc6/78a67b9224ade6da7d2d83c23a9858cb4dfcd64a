mmc: mmc_spi: Add/rename defines for timeouts

Clarify the use of r1b_timeout, by renaming it to MMC_SPI_R1B_TIMEOUT_MS
and by dropping the corresponding confusing comment about it.

Additionally, let's also add a new define, MMC_SPI_INIT_TIMEOUT_MS and use
it during the initialization. Even if these two defines are given the same
value, the split makes it easier to understand them.
