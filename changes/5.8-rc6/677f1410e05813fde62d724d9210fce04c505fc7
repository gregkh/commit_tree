scripts/checkstack.pl: don't display $dre as different entity

currently script prints stack usage for functions
in two ways:($re and $dre)

dre breaks sorting mechanism.
0xffffa00011f26f88 sunxi_mux_clk_setup.isra.0 [vmlinux]:Dynamic (0x140)
..
0xffffa00011f27210 sunxi_divs_clk_setup [vmlinux]:      Dynamic (0x1d0)

so we can print it in decimal only.

Also address before function name is changed to function
start address rather than stack consumption address.
Because in next patch, arm has two ways to use stack
which can be clubbed and printed in one function only.

All symbols whose stack by adding(re and dre) is greater than
100, will be printed.
