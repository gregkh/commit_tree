powerpc/8xx: Allow large TLBs with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

DEBUG_PAGEALLOC only manages RW data.

Text and RO data can still be mapped with hugepages and pinned TLB.

In order to map with hugepages, also enforce a 512kB data alignment
minimum. That's a trade-off between size of speed, taking into
account that DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is a debug option. Anyway the alignment
is still tunable.

We also allow tuning of alignment for book3s to limit the complexity
of the test in Kconfig that will anyway disappear in the following
patches once DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is handled together with BATs.
