tracing/probe: Fix bpf_task_fd_query() for kprobes and uprobes

Commit 60d53e2c3b75 ("tracing/probe: Split trace_event related data from
trace_probe") removed the trace_[ku]probe structure from the
trace_event_call->data pointer. As bpf_get_[ku]probe_info() were
forgotten in that change, fix them now. These functions are currently
only used by the bpf_task_fd_query() syscall handler to collect
information about a perf event.
