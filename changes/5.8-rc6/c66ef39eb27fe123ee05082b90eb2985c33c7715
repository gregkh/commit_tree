hwmon: (drivetemp) Avoid SCT usage on Toshiba DT01ACA family drives

It has been observed that Toshiba DT01ACA family drives have
WRITE FPDMA QUEUED command timeouts and sometimes just freeze until
power-cycled under heavy write loads when their temperature is getting
polled in SCT mode. The SMART mode seems to be fine, though.

Let's make sure we don't use SCT mode for these drives then.

While only the 3 TB model was actually caught exhibiting the problem let's
play safe here to avoid data corruption and extend the ban to the whole
family.
