scsi: ufs: Cleanup WriteBooster feature

Small cleanup as below items,

 1. Use ufshcd_is_wb_allowed() directly instead of ufshcd_wb_sup() since
    ufshcd_wb_sup() just returns the result of ufshcd_is_wb_allowed().

 2. In ufshcd_suspend(), "else if (!ufshcd_is_runtime_pm(pm_op)) can be
    simplified to "else" since both have the same meaning.

This patch does not change any functionality.
