drm/i915/execlists: Avoid reusing the same logical CCID

The bspec is confusing on the nature of the upper 32bits of the LRC
descriptor. Once upon a time, it said that it uses the upper 32b to
decide if it should perform a lite-restore, and so we must ensure that
each unique context submitted to HW is given a unique CCID [for the
duration of it being on the HW]. Currently, this is achieved by using
a small circular tag, and assigning every context submitted to HW a
new id. However, this tag is being cleared on repinning an inflight
context such that we end up re-using the 0 tag for multiple contexts.

To avoid accidentally clearing the CCID in the upper 32bits of the LRC
descriptor, split the descriptor into two dwords so we can update the
GGTT address separately from the CCID.
