drm: Use drmm_ for drm_dev_init cleanup

Well for the simple stuff at least, vblank, gem and minor cleanup I
want to further split up as a demonstration.

v2: We need to clear drm_device->dev otherwise the debug drm printing
after our cleanup hook (e.g. in drm_manged_release) will chase
released memory and result in a use-after-free. Not really pretty, but
oh well.
