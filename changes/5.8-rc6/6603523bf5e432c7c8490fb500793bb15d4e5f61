crypto: api - Fix use-after-free and race in crypto_spawn_alg

There are two problems in crypto_spawn_alg.  First of all it may
return spawn->alg even if spawn->dead is set.  This results in a
double-free as detected by syzbot.

Secondly the setting of the DYING flag is racy because we hold
the read-lock instead of the write-lock.  We should instead call
crypto_shoot_alg in a safe manner by gaining a refcount, dropping
the lock, and then releasing the refcount.

This patch fixes both problems.
