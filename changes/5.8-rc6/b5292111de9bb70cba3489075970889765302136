libata: Use per port sync for detach

Commit 130f4caf145c ("libata: Ensure ata_port probe has completed before
detach") may cause system freeze during suspend.

Using async_synchronize_full() in PM callbacks is wrong, since async
callbacks that are already scheduled may wait for not-yet-scheduled
callbacks, causes a circular dependency.

Instead of using big hammer like async_synchronize_full(), use async
cookie to make sure port probe are synced, without affecting other
scheduled PM callbacks.
