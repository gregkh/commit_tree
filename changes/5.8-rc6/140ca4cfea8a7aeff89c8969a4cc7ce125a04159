usb: dwc3: gadget: Handle stream transfers

Overview of stream transfer requirement:
 * A transfer will have a set of TRBs of the same stream ID.
 * A transfer is started with a stream ID in START_TRANSFER command.
 * A new stream will only start when the previous completes.

Overview of stream events:
 * A "prime" from host indicates that its endpoints are active
   (buffers prepared and ready to receive/transmit data). The controller
   automatically initiates stream if it sees this.
 * A "NoStream" rejection event indicates that the host isn't ready.
   Host will put the endpoint back to idle state. Device may need to
   reinitiate the stream to start transfer again.
 * A Stream Found event means host accepted device initiated stream.
   Nothing needs to be done from driver.

To initiate a stream, the driver will issue START_TRANSFER command with
a stream ID. To reinitiate the stream, the driver must issue
END_TRANSFER and restart the transfer with START_TRANSFER command with
the same stream ID.

This implementation handles device-initated streams (e.g. UASP driver).
It also handles some hosts' quirky behavior where they only prime each
endpoint once.
