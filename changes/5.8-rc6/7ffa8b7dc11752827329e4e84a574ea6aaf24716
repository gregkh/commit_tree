powerpc/64: Don't initialise init_task->thread.regs

Aneesh increased the size of struct pt_regs by 16 bytes and started
seeing this WARN_ON:

Which was unexpected. The warning is checking the thread.regs->msr
value of the task we are switching from:

  usermsr = tsk->thread.regs->msr;
  ...
  WARN_ON((usermsr & MSR_VSX) && !((usermsr & MSR_FP) && (usermsr & MSR_VEC)));

ie. if MSR_VSX is set then both of MSR_FP and MSR_VEC are also set.

Dumping tsk->thread.regs->msr we see that it's: 0x1db60000

Which is not a normal looking MSR, in fact the only valid bit is
MSR_VSX, all the other bits are reserved in the current definition of
the MSR.

We can see from the oops that it was swapper/0 that we were switching
from when we hit the warning, ie. init_task. So its thread.regs points
to the base (high addresses) in init_stack.

Dumping the content of init_task->thread.regs, with the members of
pt_regs annotated (the 16 bytes larger version), we see:

This looks suspiciously like stack frames, not a pt_regs. If we look
closely we can see return addresses from the stack trace above,
c000000002004820 (start_kernel) and c00000000000c49c (start_here_common).

init_task->thread.regs is setup at build time in processor.h:

  #define INIT_THREAD  { \
  	.ksp = INIT_SP, \
  	.regs = (struct pt_regs *)INIT_SP - 1, /* XXX bogus, I think */ \

The early boot code where we setup the initial stack is:

  LOAD_REG_ADDR(r3,init_thread_union)

  /* set up a stack pointer */
  LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE(r1,THREAD_SIZE)
  add	r1,r3,r1
  li	r0,0
  stdu	r0,-STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD(r1)

Which creates a stack frame of size 112 bytes (STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD).
Which is far too small to contain a pt_regs.

So the result is init_task->thread.regs is pointing at some stack
frames on the init stack, not at a pt_regs.

We have gotten away with this for so long because with pt_regs at its
current size the MSR happens to point into the first frame, at a
location that is not written to by the early asm. With the 16 byte
expansion the MSR falls into the second frame, which is used by the
compiler, and collides with a saved register that tends to be
non-zero.

As far as I can see this has been wrong since the original merge of
64-bit ppc support, back in 2002.

Conceptually swapper should have no regs, it never entered from
userspace, and in fact that's what we do on 32-bit. It's also
presumably what the "bogus" comment is referring to.

So I think the right fix is to just not-initialise regs at all. I'm
slightly worried this will break some code that isn't prepared for a
NULL regs, but we'll have to see.

Remove the comment in head_64.S which refers to us setting up the
regs (even though we never did), and is otherwise not really accurate
any more.
