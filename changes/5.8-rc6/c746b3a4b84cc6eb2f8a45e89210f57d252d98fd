KVM: VMX: Skip global INVVPID fallback if vpid==0 in vpid_sync_context()

Skip the global INVVPID in the unlikely scenario that vpid==0 and the
SINGLE_CONTEXT variant of INVVPID is unsupported.  If vpid==0, there's
no need to INVVPID as it's impossible to do VM-Enter with VPID enabled
and vmcs.VPID==0, i.e. there can't be any TLB entries for the vCPU with
vpid==0.  The fact that the SINGLE_CONTEXT variant isn't supported is
irrelevant.
