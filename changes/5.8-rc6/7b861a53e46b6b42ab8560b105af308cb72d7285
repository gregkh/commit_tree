kasan: Bump required compiler version

Adds config variable CC_HAS_WORKING_NOSANITIZE_ADDRESS, which will be
true if we have a compiler that does not fail builds due to
no_sanitize_address functions. This does not yet mean they work as
intended, but for automated build-tests, this is the minimum
requirement.

For example, we require that __always_inline functions used from
no_sanitize_address functions do not generate instrumentation. On GCC <=
7 this fails to build entirely, therefore we make the minimum version
GCC 8.
