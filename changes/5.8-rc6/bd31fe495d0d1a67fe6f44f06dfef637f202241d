KVM: VMX: Add proper cache tracking for CR0

Move CR0 caching into the standard register caching mechanism in order
to take advantage of the availability checks provided by regs_avail.
This avoids multiple VMREADs in the (uncommon) case where kvm_read_cr0()
is called multiple times in a single VM-Exit, and more importantly
eliminates a kvm_x86_ops hook, saves a retpoline on SVM when reading
CR0, and squashes the confusing naming discrepancy of "cache_reg" vs.
"decache_cr0_guest_bits".

No functional change intended.
