ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add alternative topology binary name

Add alternative topology binary file name based on used machine driver
and fallback to use this name after failed attempt to load topology file
with name based on NHLT.
This change addresses multiple issues with current mechanism, for
example - there are devices without NHLT table, and that currently
results in tplg_name being empty.
