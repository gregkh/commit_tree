net/smc: llc_del_link_work and use the LLC flow for delete link

Introduce a work that is scheduled when a new DELETE_LINK LLC request is
received. The work will call either the SMC client or SMC server
DELETE_LINK processing.
And use the LLC flow framework to process incoming DELETE_LINK LLC
messages, scheduling the llc_del_link_work for those events.
With these changes smc_lgr_forget() is only called by one function and
can be migrated into smc_lgr_cleanup_early().
