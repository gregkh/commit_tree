spi: amd: Drop duplicate driver data assignments

The AMD SPI driver calls platform_set_drvdata() on probe even though
it's already been set by __spi_alloc_controller().  Likewise, it calls
platform_set_drvdata() on remove even though it's going to be set by
__device_release_driver().  Drop the duplicate assignments.
