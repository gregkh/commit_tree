MIPS: cleanup fixup_bigphys_addr handling

fixup_bigphys_addr is only provided by the alchemy platform.  Remove
all the stubs, and ensure we only call it if it is actually implemented.

Also don't bother implementing io_remap_pfn_range if we don't have to,
and move the remaining implementation to alchemy platform code.
