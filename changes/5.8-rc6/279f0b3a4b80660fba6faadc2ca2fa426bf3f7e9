hwmon: (k10temp) Add AMD family 17h model 60h PCI match

Add support for retrieving Tdie and Tctl on AMD Renoir (4000-series
Ryzen CPUs).

It appears SMU offsets for reading current/voltage and CCD temperature
have changed for this generation (reads from currently used offsets
yield zeros), so those features cannot be enabled so trivially.
