ALSA: firewire-motu: add model-specific table of chunk count

In MOTU protocol, data block consists of SPH and 24-bit chunks
aligned to quadlet. The number of chunks per data block is specific
to model. For models with optical interface, the number differs
depending on I/O settings for the interface (ADAT, TOSLINK).

Currently the number is calculated from flags in model-specific
data. However this is weak in the case that the model has quirks.
Actually, for quirks of some models, flags are used against their
original meanings.

This commit adds model-specific table of chunk count. For future
integration, this table is based on the calculation.
