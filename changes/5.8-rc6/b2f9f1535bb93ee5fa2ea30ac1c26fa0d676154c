libbpf: Fix libbpf hashmap on (I)LP32 architectures

On ILP32, 64-bit result was shifted by value calculated for 32-bit long type
and returned value was much outside hashmap capacity.
As advised by Andrii Nakryiko, this patch uses different hashing variant for
architectures with size_t shorter than long long.
