x86/PCI: Mark Intel C620 MROMs as having non-compliant BARs

The Intel C620 Platform Controller Hub has MROM functions that have non-PCI
registers (undocumented in the public spec) where BAR 0 is supposed to be,
which results in messages like this:

  pci 0000:00:11.0: [Firmware Bug]: reg 0x30: invalid BAR (can't size)

Mark these MROM functions as having non-compliant BARs so we don't try to
probe any of them.  There are no other BARs on these devices.

See the Intel C620 Series Chipset Platform Controller Hub Datasheet,
May 2019, Document Number 336067-007US, sec 2.1, 35.5, 35.6.
