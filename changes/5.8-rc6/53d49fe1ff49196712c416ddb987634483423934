soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Remove get_tcs_of_type() abstraction

The get_tcs_of_type() function doesn't provide any value.  It's not
conceptually difficult to access a value in an array, even if that
value is in a structure and we want a pointer to the value.  Having
the function in there makes me feel like it's doing something fancier
like looping or searching.  Remove it.
