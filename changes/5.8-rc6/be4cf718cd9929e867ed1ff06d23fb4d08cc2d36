dmaengine: imx-sdma: initialize all script addresses

The script addresses array increases with each new version. The driver
initializes the array to -EINVAL initially, but only up to the size
of the v1 array. Initialize the additional addresses for the newer
versions as well. Without this uninitialized values of the newer arrays
are treated as valid.
