bpf: Selftests, verifier case for non null pointer map value branch

When we have pointer type that is known to be non-null we only follow
the non-null branch. This adds tests to cover the map_value pointer
returned from a map lookup. To force an error if both branches are
followed we do an ALU op on R10.
