btrfs: don't set SHAREABLE flag for data reloc tree

SHAREABLE flag is set for subvolumes because users can create snapshot
for subvolumes, thus sharing tree blocks of them.

But data reloc tree is not exposed to user space, as it's only an
internal tree for data relocation, thus it doesn't need the full path
replacement handling at all.

This patch will make data reloc tree a non-shareable tree, and add
btrfs_fs_info::data_reloc_root for data reloc tree, so relocation code
can grab it from fs_info directly.

This would slightly improve tree relocation, as now data reloc tree
can go through regular COW routine to get relocated, without bothering
the complex tree reloc tree routine.
