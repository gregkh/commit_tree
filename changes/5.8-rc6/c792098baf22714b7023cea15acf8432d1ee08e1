drm/tidss: Drop explicit drm_mode_config_cleanup call

It's right above the drm_dev_put().

This is made possible by a preceeding patch which added a drmm_
cleanup action to drm_mode_config_init(), hence all we need to do to
ensure that drm_mode_config_cleanup() is run on final drm_device
cleanup is check the new error code for _init().

Aside: Another driver with a bit much devm_kzalloc, which should
probably use drmm_kzalloc instead ...

I'm pretty sure this one blows up already under KASAN because it's
using devm_drm_dev_init, and later on devm_kzalloc. Hence the memory
will get freed before the final drm_dev_put (all from the devres
code), but the cleanup in that final drm_dev_put will access the just
freed memory.

Unfortunately fixing this properly needs slightly more work, namely
drmm_ versions for all the drm objects (planes, crtc, ...), so that
the cleanup actually happens before even drmm_kzalloc would release
the underlying memory. Not quite there yet.

v2: Explain why this cleanup is possible (Laurent).

v3: Use drmm_mode_config_init() for more clarity (Sam, Thomas)
