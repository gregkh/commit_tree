KVM: nVMX: Prioritize SMI over nested IRQ/NMI

Check for an unblocked SMI in vmx_check_nested_events() so that pending
SMIs are correctly prioritized over IRQs and NMIs when the latter events
will trigger VM-Exit.  This also fixes an issue where an SMI that was
marked pending while processing a nested VM-Enter wouldn't trigger an
immediate exit, i.e. would be incorrectly delayed until L2 happened to
take a VM-Exit.
