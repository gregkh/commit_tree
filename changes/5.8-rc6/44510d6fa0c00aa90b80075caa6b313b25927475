s390/pci: Handling multifunctions

We allow multiple functions on a single bus.
We suppress the ZPCI_DEVFN definition and replace its
occurences with zpci->devfn.

We verify the number of device during the registration.

There can never be more domains in use than existing
devices, so we do not need to verify the count of domain
after having verified the count of devices.
