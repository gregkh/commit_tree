ice: Add helper function for clearing VPGEN_VFRTRIG

Create a helper function for clearing VPGEN_VFRTRIG as this needs to be
done on reset to notify the VF that we are done resetting it. Also, it
needs to be done on SR-IOV initialization/creation in case it was left
in a bad state after SR-IOV tear down.
