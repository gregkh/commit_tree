arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rtl8211e nodename for rk3399-orangepi

A test with the command below gives this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-orangepi.dt.yaml: phy@1:
'#phy-cells' is a required property

The phy nodename is used by a phy-handle.
The parent node is compatible with "snps,dwmac-mdio",
so change nodename to 'ethernet-phy', for which '#phy-cells'
is not a required property

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/dtschema/schemas/
phy/phy-provider.yaml
