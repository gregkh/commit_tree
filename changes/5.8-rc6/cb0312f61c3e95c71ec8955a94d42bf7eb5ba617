ASoC: SOF: imx: fix undefined reference issue

make.cross ARCH=mips allyesconfig fails with the following error:

sound/soc/sof/sof-of-dev.o:(.data.sof_of_imx8qxp_desc+0x40): undefined
reference to `sof_imx8x_ops'.

This seems to be a Makefile order issue, solve by using the same
structure as for Intel platforms.

dependency")
