powerpc/8xx: Allow STRICT_KERNEL_RwX with pinned TLB

Pinned TLB are 8M. Now that there is no strict boundary anymore
between text and RO data, it is possible to use 8M pinned executable
TLB that covers both text and RO data.

When PIN_TLB_DATA or PIN_TLB_TEXT is selected, enforce 8M RW data
alignment and allow STRICT_KERNEL_RWX.
