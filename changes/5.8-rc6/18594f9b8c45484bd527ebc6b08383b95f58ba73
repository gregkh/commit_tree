powerpc/64s/radix: Don't prefetch DAR in update_mmu_cache

The idea behind this prefetch was to kick off a page table walk before
returning from the fault, getting some pipelining advantage.

But this never showed up any noticable performance advantage, and in
fact with KUAP the prefetches are actually blocked and cause some
kind of micro-architectural fault. Removing this improves page fault
microbenchmark performance by about 9%.
