drm/vboxvideo: use managed pci functions

Allows us to drop the cleanup code on the floor.

Sam noticed in his review:
> With this change we avoid calling pci_disable_device()
> twise in case vbox_mm_init() fails.
> Once in vbox_hw_fini() and once in the error path.

v2: Include Sam's review remarks

v3: Fix typo in commit summary (Thomas Zimmermann)
