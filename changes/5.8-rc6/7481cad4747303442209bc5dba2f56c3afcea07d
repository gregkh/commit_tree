selftests/powerpc: Add a test of counting larx/stcx

This is based on the count_instructions test.

However this one also counts the number of failed stcx's, and in
conjunction with knowing the size of the stcx loop, can calculate the
total number of instructions executed even in the face of
non-deterministic stcx failures.
