s390/qeth: indicate contiguous TX buffer elements

The TX path usually maps the full content of a page into a buffer
element. But there's specific skb layouts (ie. linearized TSO skbs)
where the HW header (1) requires a separate buffer element, and (2) is
page-contiguous with the packet data that's mapped into the next buffer
element.
Flag such buffer elements accordingly, so that HW can optimize its data
access for them.
