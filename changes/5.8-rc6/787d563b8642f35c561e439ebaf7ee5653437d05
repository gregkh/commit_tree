mm/debug_vm_pgtable: fix kernel crash by checking for THP support

Architectures can have CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE enabled but no THP
support enabled based on platforms.  For ex: with 4K PAGE_SIZE ppc64
supports THP only with radix translation.

This results in below crash when running with hash translation and 4K
PAGE_SIZE.

    kernel BUG at arch/powerpc/include/asm/book3s/64/hash-4k.h:140!

Check for THP support correctly
