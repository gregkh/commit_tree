xfs: clean up xchk_bmap_check_rmaps usage of XFS_IFORK_Q

XFS_IFORK_Q is supposed to be a predicate, not a function returning a
value.  Its usage is in xchk_bmap_check_rmaps is incorrect, but that
function only cares about whether or not the "size" of the data is zero
or not.  Convert that logic to use a proper boolean, and teach the
caller to skip the call entirely if the end result would be that we'd do
nothing anyway.  This avoids a crash later in this series.
