bridge: mrp: Fix out-of-bounds read in br_mrp_parse

The issue was reported by syzbot. When the function br_mrp_parse was
called with a valid net_bridge_port, the net_bridge was an invalid
pointer. Therefore the check br->stp_enabled could pass/fail
depending where it was pointing in memory.
The fix consists of setting the net_bridge pointer if the port is a
valid pointer.
