KVM: x86/mmu: Move fast_cr3_switch() side effects to __kvm_mmu_new_cr3()

Handle the side effects of a fast CR3 (PGD) switch up a level in
__kvm_mmu_new_cr3(), which is the only caller of fast_cr3_switch().

This consolidates handling all side effects in __kvm_mmu_new_cr3()
(where freeing the current root when KVM can't do a fast switch is
already handled), and ameliorates the pain of adding a second boolean in
a future patch to provide a separate "skip" override for the MMU sync.
