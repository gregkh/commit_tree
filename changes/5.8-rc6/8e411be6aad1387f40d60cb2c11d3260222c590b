arm64: compat: Always use sigpage for sigreturn trampoline

The 32-bit sigreturn trampoline in the compat sigpage matches the binary
representation of the arch/arm/ sigpage exactly. This is important for
debuggers (e.g. GDB) and unwinders (e.g. libunwind) since they rely
on matching the instruction sequence in order to identify that they are
unwinding through a signal. The same cannot be said for the sigreturn
trampoline in the compat vDSO, which defeats the unwinder heuristics and
instead attempts to use unwind directives for the unwinding. This is in
contrast to arch/arm/, which never uses the vDSO for sigreturn.

Ensure compatibility with arch/arm/ and existing unwinders by always
using the sigpage for the sigreturn trampoline, regardless of the
presence of the compat vDSO.
