KVM: VMX: Add proper cache tracking for CR4

Move CR4 caching into the standard register caching mechanism in order
to take advantage of the availability checks provided by regs_avail.
This avoids multiple VMREADs and retpolines (when configured) during
nested VMX transitions as kvm_read_cr4_bits() is invoked multiple times
on each transition, e.g. when stuffing CR0 and CR3.

As an added bonus, this eliminates a kvm_x86_ops hook, saves a retpoline
on SVM when reading CR4, and squashes the confusing naming discrepancy
of "cache_reg" vs. "decache_cr4_guest_bits".

No functional change intended.
