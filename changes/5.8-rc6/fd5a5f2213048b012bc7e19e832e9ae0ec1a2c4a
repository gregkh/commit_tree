nvme-fc: Update header and host for common definitions for LS handling

Given that both host and target now generate and receive LS's create
a single table definition for LS names. Each tranport half will have
a local version of the table.

As Create Association LS is issued by both sides, and received by
both sides, create common routines to format the LS and to validate
the LS.

Convert the host side transport to use the new common Create
Association LS formatting routine.
