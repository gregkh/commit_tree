selftests/bpf: Add test for SO_BINDTODEVICE opt of bpf_setsockopt

This test intended to verify if SO_BINDTODEVICE option works in
bpf_setsockopt. Because we already in the SOL_SOCKET level in this
connect bpf prog its safe to verify the sanity in the beginning of
the connect_v4_prog by calling the bind_to_device test helper.

The testing environment already created by the test_sock_addr.sh
script so this test assume that two netdevices already existing in
the system: veth pair with names test_sock_addr1 and test_sock_addr2.
The test will try to bind the socket to those devices first.
Then the test assume there are no netdevice with "nonexistent_dev"
name so the bpf_setsockopt will give use ENODEV error.
At the end the test remove the device binding from the socket
by binding it to an empty name.
