mtd: spi-nor: sfdp: add/use local variable in spi_nor_parse_bfpt()

Despite of how spi_nor_parse_bfpt() abuses the structure fields during
their calculation, gcc manages to make some decent code out of that. :-)
Yet adding a local variable to store the BFPT DWORDs during calculations
still saves 12 bytes of the object code (AArch64 gcc 4.8.5)...
