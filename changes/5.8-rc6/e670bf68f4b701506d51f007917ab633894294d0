KVM: nSVM: save all control fields in svm->nested

In preparation for nested SVM save/restore, store all data that matters
from the VMCB control area into svm->nested.  It will then become part
of the nested SVM state that is saved by KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE and
restored by KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE, just like the cached vmcs12 for nVMX.
