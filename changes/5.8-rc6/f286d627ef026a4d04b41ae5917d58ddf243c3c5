gfs2: Keep track of deleted inode generations in LVBs

When deleting an inode, keep track of the generation of the deleted inode in
the inode glock Lock Value Block (LVB).  When trying to delete an inode
remotely, check the last-known inode generation against the deleted inode
generation to skip duplicate remote deletes.  This avoids taking the resource
group glock in order to verify the block type.
