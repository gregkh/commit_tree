platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode switch on "Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types

Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode
switch on 2-in-1's") added a DMI chassis-type check to avoid accidentally
reporting SW_TABLET_MODE = 1 to userspace on laptops.

Some devices with a detachable keyboard and using the intel-vbnt (INT33D6)
interface to report if they are in tablet mode (keyboard detached) or not,
report 32 / "Detachable" as chassis-type, e.g. the HP Pavilion X2 series.

Other devices with a detachable keyboard and using the intel-vbnt (INT33D6)
interface to report SW_TABLET_MODE, report 8 / "Portable" as chassis-type.
The Dell Venue 11 Pro 7130 is an example of this.

Extend the DMI chassis-type check to also accept Portables and Detachables
so that the intel-vbtn driver will report SW_TABLET_MODE on these devices.

Note the chassis-type check was originally added to avoid a false-positive
tablet-mode report on the Dell XPS 9360 laptop. To the best of my knowledge
that laptop is using a chassis-type of 9 / "Laptop", so after this commit
we still ignore the tablet-switch for that chassis-type.
