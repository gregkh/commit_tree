iommu/vt-d: Report SVA feature with generic flag

Query Shared Virtual Address/Memory capability is a generic feature.
SVA feature check is the required first step before calling
iommu_sva_bind_device().

VT-d checks SVA feature enabling at per IOMMU level during this step,
SVA bind device will check and enable PCI ATS, PRS, and PASID capabilities
at device level.

This patch reports Intel SVM as SVA feature such that generic code
(e.g. Uacce [1]) can use it.
