sched/cfs: change initial value of runnable_avg

Some performance regression on reaim benchmark have been raised with
  commit 070f5e860ee2 ("sched/fair: Take into account runnable_avg to classify group")

The problem comes from the init value of runnable_avg which is initialized
with max value. This can be a problem if the newly forked task is finally
a short task because the group of CPUs is wrongly set to overloaded and
tasks are pulled less agressively.

Set initial value of runnable_avg equals to util_avg to reflect that there
is no waiting time so far.
