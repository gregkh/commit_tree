x86/cpu: Uninline CR4 accessors

cpu_tlbstate is exported because various TLB-related functions need
access to it, but cpu_tlbstate is sensitive information which should
only be accessed by well-contained kernel functions and not be directly
exposed to modules.

The various CR4 accessors require cpu_tlbstate as the CR4 shadow cache
is located there.

In preparation for unexporting cpu_tlbstate, create a builtin function
for manipulating CR4 and rework the various helpers to use it.

No functional change.

 [ bp: push the export of native_write_cr4() only when CONFIG_LKTDM=m to
   the last patch in the series. ]
