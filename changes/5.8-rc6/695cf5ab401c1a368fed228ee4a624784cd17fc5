ALSA: usb-audio: Fix packet size calculation

Commit f0bd62b64016 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Improve frames size computation")
introduced a regression for devices which have playback endpoints with
bInterval > 1. Fix this by taking ep->datainterval into account.

Note that frame and fps are actually mean packet and packets per second
in the code introduces by the mentioned commit. This will be fixed in a
follow-up patch.
