ALSA: hda - let hs_mic be picked ahead of hp_mic

We have a Dell AIO, there is neither internal speaker nor internal
mic, only a multi-function audio jack on it.

Users reported that after freshly installing the OS and plug
a headset to the audio jack, the headset can't output sound. I
reproduced this bug, at that moment, the Input Source is as below:
Simple mixer control 'Input Source',0
  Capabilities: cenum
  Items: 'Headphone Mic' 'Headset Mic'
  Item0: 'Headphone Mic'

That is because the patch_realtek will set this audio jack as mic_in
mode if Input Source's value is hp_mic.

If it is not fresh installing, this issue will not happen since the
systemd will run alsactl restore -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state, this
will set the 'Input Source' according to history value.

If there is internal speaker or internal mic, this issue will not
happen since there is valid sink/source in the pulseaudio, the PA will
set the 'Input Source' according to active_port.

To fix this issue, change the parser function to let the hs_mic be
stored ahead of hp_mic.
