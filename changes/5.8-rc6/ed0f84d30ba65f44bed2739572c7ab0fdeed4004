exfat: replace 'time_ms' with 'time_cs'

Replace time_ms  with time_cs in the file directory entry structure
and related functions.

The unit of create_time_ms/modify_time_ms in File Directory Entry are not
'milli-second', but 'centi-second'.
The exfat specification uses the term '10ms', but instead use 'cs' as in
msdos_fs.h.
