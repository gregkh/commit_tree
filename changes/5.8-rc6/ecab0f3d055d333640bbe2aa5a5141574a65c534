drm/i915: Track active_pipes in bw_state

We need to calculate SAGV mask also in a non-modeset
commit, however currently active_pipes are only calculated
for modesets in global atomic state, thus now we will be
tracking those also in bw_state in order to be able to
properly access global data.

v2: - Removed pre/post plane SAGV updates from modeset(Ville)
    - Now tracking active pipes in intel_can_enable_sagv(Ville)

v3: - lock global state if active_pipes change as well(Ville)
