mmc: atmel-mci: Keep timer enabled when queuing a next request

When atmci_request_end() is about to finish a request for one slot, there
is a possibility that there is new request queued for another slot. If this
turns out to be the case, the new request is started and the timer is
re-programmed for it.

Although, a few lines below in atmci_request_end(), this timer becomes
deleted, likely corresponding to the other recently completed request. This
looks wrong, so let's fix it.
