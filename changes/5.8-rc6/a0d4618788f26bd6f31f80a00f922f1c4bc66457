usb: typec: ucsi: Workaround for missed op_mode change

EC firmware on Dell XPS & Latitude series does not set "Power Operation
Mode Change" bit in "Connector Status change" field of MESSAGE IN Data
while transitioning from type-C current to PD mode.

Instead the "Negotiated Power Level Change" bit is set when the "Power
Operation Mode" field shows the correct mode (i.e. PD).

This patch adds a check for this bit also, to trigger an update of
power operation mode in class driver, while handling GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS
command.
