platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Add managed function to register SCU IPC

Drivers such as intel_pmc_ipc.c can be unloaded as well so in order to
support those in this driver add a new function that can be called to
unregister the SCU IPC when it is not needed anymore.

We also add a managed version of the intel_scu_ipc_register() that takes
care of calling intel_scu_ipc_unregister() automatically when the driver
is unbound.
