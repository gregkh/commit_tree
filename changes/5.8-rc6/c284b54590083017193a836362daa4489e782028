switchdev: mrp: Extend switchdev API to offload MRP

Extend switchdev API to add support for MRP. The HW is notified in
following cases:

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_MRP: This is used when a MRP instance is added/removed
  from the MRP ring.

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_RING_ROLE_MRP: This is used when the role of the node
  changes. The current supported roles are MRM and MRC.

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_RING_TEST_MRP: This is used when to start/stop sending
  MRP_Test frames on the mrp ring ports. This is called only on nodes that have
  the role MRM. In case this fails then the SW will generate the frames.

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_RING_STATE_STATE: This is used when the ring changes it states
  to open or closed. This is required to notify HW because the MRP_Test frame
  contains the field MRP_InState which contains this information.

SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_MRP_PORT_STATE: This is used when the port's state is
  changed. It can be in blocking/forwarding mode.

SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_MRP_PORT_ROLE: This is used when port's role changes. The
  roles of the port can be primary/secondary. This is required to notify HW
  because the MRP_Test frame contains the field MRP_PortRole that contains this
  information.
