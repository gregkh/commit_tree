Drivers: hv: vmbus: Remove the unused HV_LOCALIZED channel affinity logic

The logic is unused since commit 509879bdb30b8 ("Drivers: hv: Introduce
a policy for controlling channel affinity").

This logic assumes that a channel target_cpu doesn't change during the
lifetime of a channel, but this assumption is incompatible with the new
functionality that allows changing the vCPU a channel will interrupt.
