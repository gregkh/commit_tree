printk/kdb: Redirect printk messages into kdb in any context

kdb has to get messages on consoles even when the system is stopped.
It uses kdb_printf() internally and calls console drivers on its own.

It uses a hack to reuse an existing code. It sets "kdb_trap_printk"
global variable to redirect even the normal printk() into the
kdb_printf() variant.

The variable "kdb_trap_printk" is checked in printk_default() and
it is ignored when printk is redirected to printk_safe in NMI context.
Solve this by moving the check into printk_func().

It is obvious that it is not fully safe. But it does not make things
worse. The console drivers are already called in this context by
db_printf() direct calls.
