KVM: VMX: enable X86_FEATURE_WAITPKG in KVM capabilities

Even though we might not allow the guest to use WAITPKG's new
instructions, we should tell KVM that the feature is supported by the
host CPU.

Note that vmx_waitpkg_supported checks that WAITPKG _can_ be set in
secondary execution controls as specified by VMX capability MSR, rather
that we actually enable it for a guest.
