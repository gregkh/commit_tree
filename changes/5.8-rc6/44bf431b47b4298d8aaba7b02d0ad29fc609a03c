mm/memory.c: Add memory read privilege on page fault handling

Here add pte_sw_mkyoung function to make page readable on MIPS
platform during page fault handling. This patch improves page
fault latency about 10% on my MIPS machine with lmbench
lat_pagefault case.

It is noop function on other arches, there is no negative
influence on those architectures.
