staging: rtl8188eu: remove 5 GHz if test

Cleanup a line over 80 characters by removing an if test that is valid
only for 5 GHz. According to the TODO 5 GHz code should be removed.

- find and remove remaining code valid only for 5 GHz. Most of the obvious
  ones have been removed, but things like channel > 14 still exist.
