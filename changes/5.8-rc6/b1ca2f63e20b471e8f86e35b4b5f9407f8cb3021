ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: add amp number in components string for ucm

The number of speaker amplifiers may vary between platforms. UCM
needs to check amp number to include different configuration files.
This patch keeps track of the number of speaker amplifiers and
stores it in components string of the card.

Tested on Comet Lake platforms.
