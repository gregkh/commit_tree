KVM: x86: don't expose MSR_IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL unconditionally

This msr is only available when the host supports WAITPKG feature.

This breaks a nested guest, if the L1 hypervisor is set to ignore
unknown msrs, because the only other safety check that the
kernel does is that it attempts to read the msr and
rejects it if it gets an exception.
