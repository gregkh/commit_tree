KVM: arm64: Fix kvm_reset_vcpu() return code being incorrect with SVE

If SVE is enabled then 'ret' can be assigned the return value of
kvm_vcpu_enable_sve() which may be 0 causing future "goto out" sites to
erroneously return 0 on failure rather than -EINVAL as expected.

Remove the initialisation of 'ret' and make setting the return value
explicit to avoid this situation in the future.
