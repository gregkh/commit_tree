drm/dp: get/set phy compliance pattern

During phy compliance auto test mode source need to read
requested test pattern from sink through DPCD. After processing
the request source need to set the pattern. So set/get method
added in drm layer as it is DP protocol.

v2: As per review feedback from Manasi on RFC version,
- added dp revision as function argument in set_phy_pattern api.
- used int for link_rate and u8 for lane_count to align with existing code.

v3: As per review feedback from Harry,
- used sizeof() instead of magic number.
- corrected kernel-doc for drm_dp_phy_test_params structure.
