staging: wfx: simplify hif_handle_tx_data()

The last argument of hif_handle_tx_data() was now unused. In add,
hif_handle_tx_data() has nothing to do with HIF layer and should be
renamed. Finally, it not convenient to pass a wfx_vif as parameter. It
is easier to let hif_handle_tx_data() find the interface itself.
