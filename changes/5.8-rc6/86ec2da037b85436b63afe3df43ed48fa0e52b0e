mm/thp: rename pmd_mknotpresent() as pmd_mkinvalid()

pmd_present() is expected to test positive after pmdp_mknotpresent() as
the PMD entry still points to a valid huge page in memory.
pmdp_mknotpresent() implies that given PMD entry is just invalidated from
MMU perspective while still holding on to pmd_page() referred valid huge
page thus also clearing pmd_present() test.  This creates the following
situation which is counter intuitive.

[pmd_present(pmd_mknotpresent(pmd)) = true]

This renames pmd_mknotpresent() as pmd_mkinvalid() reflecting the helper's
functionality more accurately while changing the above mentioned situation
as follows.  This does not create any functional change.

[pmd_present(pmd_mkinvalid(pmd)) = true]

This is not applicable for platforms that define own pmdp_invalidate() via
__HAVE_ARCH_PMDP_INVALIDATE.  Suggestion for renaming came during a
previous discussion here.
