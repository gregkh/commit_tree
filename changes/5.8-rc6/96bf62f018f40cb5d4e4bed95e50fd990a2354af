ASoC: soc-pcm: fix checks for multi-cpu FE dailinks

soc_dpcm_fe_runtime_update() is called for all dailinks, and we want
to first discard all back-ends, then deal with front-ends.

The existing code first reports an error with multi-cpu front-ends,
and that check needs to be moved after we know that we are dealing
with a front-end.

Fixes: 6e1276a5e613d ('ASoC: Return error if the function does not support multi-cpu')
