fs/ext4: Update ext4_should_use_dax()

S_DAX should only be enabled when the underlying block device supports
dax.

Cache the underlying support for DAX in the super block and modify
ext4_should_use_dax() to check for device support prior to the over
riding mount option.

While we are at it change the function to ext4_should_enable_dax() as
this better reflects the ask as well as matches xfs.
