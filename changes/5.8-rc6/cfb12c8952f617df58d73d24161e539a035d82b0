arm64: dts: imx8mn-ddr4-evk: correct ldo1/ldo2 voltage range

Correct ldo1 voltage range from wrong high group(3.0V~3.3V) to low group
(1.6V~1.9V) because the ldo1 should be 1.8V. Actually, two voltage groups
have been supported at bd718x7-regulator driver, hence, just corrrect the
voltage range to 1.6V~3.3V. For ldo2@0.8V, correct voltage range too.
Otherwise, ldo1 would be kept @3.0V and ldo2@0.9V which violate i.mx8mn
datasheet as the below warning log in kernel:

[    0.995524] LDO1: Bringing 1800000uV into 3000000-3000000uV
[    0.999196] LDO2: Bringing 800000uV into 900000-900000uV
