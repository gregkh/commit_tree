drm/i915/gt: Sanitize GT first

We see that if the HW doesn't actually sleep, the HW may eat the poison
we set in its write-only HWSP during sanitize:

  intel_gt_resume.part.8: 0000:00:02.0
  __gt_unpark: 0000:00:02.0
  gt_sanitize: 0000:00:02.0 force:yes
  process_csb: 0000:00:02.0 vcs0: cs-irq head=5, tail=90
  process_csb: 0000:00:02.0 vcs0: csb[0]: status=0x5a5a5a5a:0x5a5a5a5a
  assert_pending_valid: Nothing pending for promotion!

The CS TAIL pointer should have been reset by reset_csb_pointers(), so
in this case it is likely that we have read back from the CPU cache and
so we must clflush our control over that page. In doing so, push the
sanitisation to the start of the GT sequence so that our poisoning is
assuredly before we start talking to the HW.
