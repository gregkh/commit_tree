arm64: vdso: Map the vDSO text with guarded pages when built for BTI

The kernel is responsible for mapping the vDSO into userspace processes,
including mapping the text section as executable. Handle the mapping of
the vDSO for BTI similarly, mapping the text section as guarded pages so
the BTI annotations in the vDSO become effective when they are present.

This will mean that we can have BTI active for the vDSO in processes that
do not otherwise support BTI. This should not be an issue for any expected
use of the vDSO.
