net: ipa: fix QMI structure definition bugs

Building with "W=1" did exactly what it was supposed to do, namely
point out some suspicious-looking code to be verified not to contain
bugs.

Some QMI message structures defined in "ipa_qmi_msg.c" contained
some bad field names (duplicating the "elem_size" field instead of
defining the "offset" field), almost certainly due to copy/paste
errors that weren't obvious in a scan of the code.  Fix these bugs.
