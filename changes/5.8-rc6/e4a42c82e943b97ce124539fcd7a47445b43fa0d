kbuild: fix broken builds because of GZIP,BZIP2,LZOP variables

Redefine GZIP, BZIP2, LZOP variables as KGZIP, KBZIP2, KLZOP resp.
GZIP, BZIP2, LZOP env variables are reserved by the tools. The original
attempt to redefine them internally doesn't work in makefiles/scripts
intercall scenarios, e.g., "make GZIP=gzip bindeb-pkg" and results in
broken builds. There can be other broken build commands because of this,
so the universal solution is to use non-reserved env variables for the
compression tools.
