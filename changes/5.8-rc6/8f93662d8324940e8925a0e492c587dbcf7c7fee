bus: Add Baikal-T1 APB-bus driver

Baikal-T1 AXI-APB bridge is used to access the SoC subsystem CSRs.
IO requests are routed to this bus by means of the DW AMBA 3 AXI
Interconnect. In case if an attempted APB transaction stays with no
response for a pre-defined time an interrupt occurs and the bus gets
freed for a next operation. This driver provides the interrupt handler
to detect the erroneous address, prints an error message about the
address fault, updates an errors counter. The counter and the APB-bus
operations timeout can be accessed via corresponding sysfs nodes.
A dedicated sysfs-node can be also used to artificially cause the
bus errors described above.
