soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: A lot of comments

I've been pouring through the rpmh-rsc code and trying to understand
it.  Document everything to the best of my ability.  All documentation
here is strictly from code analysis--no actual knowledge of the
hardware was used.  If something is wrong in here I either
misunderstood the code, had a typo, or the code has a bug in it
leading to my incorrect understanding.

In a few places here I have documented things that don't make tons of
sense.  A future patch will try to address this.  While this means I'm
adding comments / todos and then later fixing them in the series, it
seemed more urgent to get things documented first so that people could
understand the later patches.

Any comments I adjusted I also tried to make match kernel-doc better.
Specifically:
- kernel-doc says do not leave a blank line between the function
  description and the arguments
- kernel-doc examples always have things starting w/ a capital and
  ending with a period.

This should be a no-op.  It's just comment changes.
