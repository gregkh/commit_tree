drm/i915/gem: Utilize rcu iteration of context engines

Now that we can peek at GEM->engines[] and obtain a reference to them
using RCU, do so for instances where we can safely iterate the
potentially old copy of the engines. For setting, we can do this when we
know the engine properties are copied over before swapping, so we know
the new engines already have the global property and we update the old
before they are discarded. For reading, we only need to be safe; as we
do so on behalf of the user, their races are their own problem.
