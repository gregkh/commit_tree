media: Kconfig files: use select for V4L2 subdevs and MC

There are lots of drivers that only work when the media controller
and/or the V4L2 subdev APIs are present.

Right now, someone need to first enable those APIs before
using those drivers.

Well, ideally, drivers, should, instead *optionally*
depend on it, in order for PC camera drivers to be able to use
them, but nowadays most drivers are UVC cameras, with don't
require a sensor driver.

So, be it.

Let's instead make them select the MEDIA_CONTROLLER and the
SUBDEV API, in order to make easier for people to be able
of enabling them.
