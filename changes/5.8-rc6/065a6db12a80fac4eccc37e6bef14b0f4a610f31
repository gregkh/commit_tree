rcu: Add READ_ONCE and data_race() to rcu_node ->boost_tasks

The rcu_node structure's ->boost_tasks field is read locklessly, so this
commit adds the READ_ONCE() to one load in order to avoid destructive
compiler optimizations.  The other load is from a diagnostic print,
so data_race() suffices.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
