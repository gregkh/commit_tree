perf jvmti: Do not report error when missing debug information

If the Java sources are compiled with -g:none to disable debug
information the perf JVMTI plugin reports a lot of errors like:

  java: GetLineNumberTable failed with JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION
  java: GetLineNumberTable failed with JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION
  java: GetLineNumberTable failed with JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION
  java: GetLineNumberTable failed with JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION
  java: GetLineNumberTable failed with JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION

Instead if GetLineNumberTable returns JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION
simply skip emitting line number information for that method. Unlike the
previous patch these errors don't affect the jitdump generation, they
just generate a lot of noise.

Similarly for native methods which also don't have line tables.
