KVM: arm64: Drop obsolete comment about sys_reg ordering

The general comment about keeping the enum order in sync
with the save/restore code has been obsolete for many years now.

Just drop it.

Note that there are other ordering requirements in the enum,
such as the PtrAuth and PMU registers, which are still valid.
