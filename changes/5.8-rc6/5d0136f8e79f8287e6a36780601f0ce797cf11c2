USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID for CH340

Add PID for CH340 that's found on some ESP8266 dev boards made by
LilyGO. The specific device that contains such serial converter can be
seen here: https://github.com/LilyGO/LILYGO-T-OI.

Apparently, it's a regular CH340, but I've confirmed with others that
also bought this board that the PID found on this device (0x7522)
differs from other devices with the "same" converter (0x7523).
Simply adding its PID to the driver and rebuilding it made it work
as expected.
