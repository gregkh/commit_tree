media: docs: move driver-specific info to driver-api

Those documents don't really describe the driver API.

Instead, they contain development-specific information.

Yet, as the main index file describes the content of it as:

	"how specific kernel subsystems work
	 from the point of view of a kernel developer"

It seems to be the better fit.
