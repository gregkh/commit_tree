drivers/mic/scif: convert get_user_pages() --> pin_user_pages()

This code was using get_user_pages*(), in a "Case 2" scenario
(DMA/RDMA), using the categorization from [1]. That means that it's
time to convert the get_user_pages*() + put_page() calls to
pin_user_pages*() + unpin_user_pages() calls.

There is some helpful background in [2]: basically, this is a small
part of fixing a long-standing disconnect between pinning pages, and
file systems' use of those pages.

Note that this effectively changes the code's behavior as well: it now
ultimately calls set_page_dirty_lock(), instead of SetPageDirty(). This
is probably more accurate.

As Christoph Hellwig put it, "set_page_dirty() is only safe if we are
dealing with a file backed page where we have reference on the inode it
hangs off." [3]
