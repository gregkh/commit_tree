ARM: dts: am335x-pocketbeagle: Fix mmc0 Write Protect

AM3358 pin mcasp0_aclkr (ZCZ ball B13) [0] is routed to P1.31 header [1]
Mode 4 of this pin is mmc0_sdwp (SD Write Protect).  A signal connected
to P1.31 may accidentally trigger mmc0 write protection.  To avoid this
situation, do not put mcasp0_aclkr in mode 4 (mmc0_sdwp) by default.
