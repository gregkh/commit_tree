ceph: request expedited service on session's last cap flush

When flushing a lot of caps to the MDS's at once (e.g. for syncfs),
we can end up waiting a substantial amount of time for MDS replies, due
to the fact that it may delay some of them so that it can batch them up
together in a single journal transaction. This can lead to stalls when
calling sync or syncfs.

What we'd really like to do is request expedited service on the _last_
cap we're flushing back to the server. If the CHECK_CAPS_FLUSH flag is
set on the request and the current inode was the last one on the
session->s_cap_dirty list, then mark the request with
CEPH_CLIENT_CAPS_SYNC.

Note that this heuristic is not perfect. New inodes can race onto the
list after we've started flushing, but it does seem to fix some common
use cases.
