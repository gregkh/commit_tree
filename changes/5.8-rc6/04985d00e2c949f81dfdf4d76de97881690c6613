ARM: tegra: Don't enable PLLX while resuming from LP1 on Tegra30

PLLX may be kept disabled if cpufreq driver selects some other clock for
CPU. In that case PLLX will be disabled later in the resume path by the
CLK driver, which also can enable PLLX if necessary by itself. Thus there
is no need to enable PLLX early during resume. Tegra114/124 CLK drivers do
not manage PLLX on resume and thus they are left untouched by this patch.
