exec: Convert security_bprm_set_creds into security_bprm_repopulate_creds

Rename bprm->cap_elevated to bprm->active_secureexec and initialize it
in prepare_binprm instead of in cap_bprm_set_creds.  Initializing
bprm->active_secureexec in prepare_binprm allows multiple
implementations of security_bprm_repopulate_creds to play nicely with
each other.

Rename security_bprm_set_creds to security_bprm_reopulate_creds to
emphasize that this path recomputes part of bprm->cred.  This
recomputation avoids the time of check vs time of use problems that
are inherent in unix #! interpreters.

In short two renames and a move in the location of initializing
bprm->active_secureexec.
