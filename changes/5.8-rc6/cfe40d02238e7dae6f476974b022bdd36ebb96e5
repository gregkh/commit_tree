panel: simple: Add BOE NV133FHM-N62

All info I could find about this panel show that it behaves the same
as the BOE NV133FHM-N61.  However, it definitely appears to be a
unique panel because reading the EDID shows "NV133FHM-N62".  We'll add
a string match for the new panel but until we find something unique
about it we'll just point at the N61's structures.
