dm zoned: metadata version 2

Implement handling for metadata version 2. The new metadata adds a
label and UUID for the device mapper device, and additional UUID for
the underlying block devices.

It also allows for an additional regular drive to be used for
emulating random access zones. The emulated zones will be placed
logically in front of the zones from the zoned block device, causing
the superblocks and metadata to be stored on that device.

The first zone of the original zoned device will be used to hold
another, tertiary copy of the metadata; this copy carries a generation
number of 0 and is never updated; it's just used for identification.
