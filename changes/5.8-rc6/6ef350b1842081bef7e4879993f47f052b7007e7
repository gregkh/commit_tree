afs: Detect cell aliases 2 - Cells with no root volumes

Implement the second phase of cell alias detection.  This part handles
alias detection for cells that don't have root.cell volumes and so we have
to find some other volume or fileserver to query.

We take the first volume from each such cell and attempt to look it up in
the new cell.  If found, we compare the records, if they are the same, we
judge the cell names to be aliases.
