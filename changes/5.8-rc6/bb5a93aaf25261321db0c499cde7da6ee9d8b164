x86/ldt: use "pr_info_once()" instead of open-coding it badly

Using a mutex for "print this warning only once" is so overdesigned as
to be actively offensive to my sensitive stomach.

Just use "pr_info_once()" that already does this, although in a
(harmlessly) racy manner that can in theory cause the message to be
printed twice if more than one CPU races on that "is this the first
time" test.

[ If somebody really cares about that harmless data race (which sounds
  very unlikely indeed), that person can trivially fix printk_once() by
  using a simple atomic access, preferably with an optimistic non-atomic
  test first before even bothering to treat the pointless "make sure it
  is _really_ just once" case.

  A mutex is most definitely never the right primitive to use for
  something like this. ]

Yes, this is a small and meaningless detail in a code path that hardly
matters.  But let's keep some code quality standards here, and not
accept outrageously bad code.
