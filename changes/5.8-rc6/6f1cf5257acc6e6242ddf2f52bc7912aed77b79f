regualtor: pfuze100: correct sw1a/sw2 on pfuze3000

PFUZE100_SWB_REG is not proper for sw1a/sw2, because enable_mask/enable_reg
is not correct. On PFUZE3000, sw1a/sw2 should be the same as sw1a/sw2 on
pfuze100 except that voltages are not linear, so add new PFUZE3000_SW_REG
and pfuze3000_sw_regulator_ops which like the non-linear PFUZE100_SW_REG
and pfuze100_sw_regulator_ops.
