powerpc: Support prefixed instructions in alignment handler

If a prefixed instruction results in an alignment exception, the
SRR1_PREFIXED bit is set. The handler attempts to emulate the
responsible instruction and then increment the NIP past it. Use
SRR1_PREFIXED to determine by how much the NIP should be incremented.

Prefixed instructions are not permitted to cross 64-byte boundaries. If
they do the alignment interrupt is invoked with SRR1 BOUNDARY bit set.
If this occurs send a SIGBUS to the offending process if in user mode.
If in kernel mode call bad_page_fault().
