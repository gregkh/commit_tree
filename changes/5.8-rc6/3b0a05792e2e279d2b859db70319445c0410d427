drm/i915: Allow asynchronous waits on the i915_active barriers

Allow the caller to also wait upon the barriers stored in i915_active.

v2: Hook up i915_request_await_active(I915_ACTIVE_AWAIT_BARRIER) as well
for completeness, and avoid the lazy GEM_BUG_ON()!

v3: Pull flush_lazy_signals() under the active-ref protection as it too
walks the rbtree and so we must be careful that we do not free it as we
iterate.
