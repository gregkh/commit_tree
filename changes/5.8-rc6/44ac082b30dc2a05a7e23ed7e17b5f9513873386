xsk: Fix xsk_umem_xdp_frame_sz()

Calculating the "data_hard_end" for an XDP buffer coming from AF_XDP
zero-copy mode, the return value of xsk_umem_xdp_frame_sz() is added
to "data_hard_start".

Currently, the chunk size of the UMEM is returned by
xsk_umem_xdp_frame_sz(). This is not correct, if the fixed UMEM
headroom is non-zero. Fix this by returning the chunk_size without the
UMEM headroom.
