RDMA/core: Add protection for shared CQs used by ULPs

A pre-step for adding shared CQs. Add the infrastructure to prevent shared
CQ users from altering the CQ configurations. For now all cqs are marked
as private (non-shared). The core driver should use the new force
functions to perform resize/destroy/moderation changes that are not
allowed for users of shared CQs.
