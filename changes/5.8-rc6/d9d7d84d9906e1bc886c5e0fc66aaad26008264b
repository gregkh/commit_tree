KVM: arm64: Parametrize exception entry with a target EL

We currently assume that an exception is delivered to EL1, always.
Once we emulate EL2, this no longer will be the case. To prepare
for this, add a target_mode parameter.

While we're at it, merge the computing of the target PC and PSTATE in
a single function that updates both PC and CPSR after saving their
previous values in the corresponding ELR/SPSR. This ensures that they
are updated in the correct order (a pretty common source of bugs...).
