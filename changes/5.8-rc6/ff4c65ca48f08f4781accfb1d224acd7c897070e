usb: hci: add hc_driver as argument for usb_hcd_pci_probe

usb_hcd_pci_probe expects users to call this with driver_data set as
hc_driver, that limits the possibility of using the driver_data for
driver data.

Add hc_driver as argument to usb_hcd_pci_probe and modify the callers
ehci/ohci/xhci/uhci to pass hc_driver as argument and freeup the
driver_data used

Tested xhci driver on Dragon-board RB3, compile tested ehci, ohci and
uhci.
