PM: runtime: clk: Fix clk_pm_runtime_get() error path

clk_pm_runtime_get() assumes that the PM-runtime usage counter will
be dropped by pm_runtime_get_sync() on errors, which is not the case,
so PM-runtime references to devices acquired by the former are leaked
on errors returned by the latter.

Fix this by modifying clk_pm_runtime_get() to drop the reference if
pm_runtime_get_sync() returns an error.
