ceph: reorganize __send_cap for less spinlock abuse

Get rid of the __releases annotation by breaking it up into two
functions: __prep_cap which is done under the spinlock and __send_cap
that is done outside it. Add new fields to cap_msg_args for the wake
boolean and old_xattr_buf pointer.

Nothing checks the return value from __send_cap, so make it void
return.
