drm/bridge: panel: Return always an error pointer in drm_panel_bridge_add()

Since commit 89958b7cd955 ("drm/bridge: panel: Infer connector type from
panel by default"), drm_panel_bridge_add() and their variants can return
NULL and an error pointer. This is fine but none of the actual users of
the API are checking for the NULL value. Instead of change all the
users, seems reasonable to return an error pointer instead. So change
the returned value for those functions when the connector type is unknown.
