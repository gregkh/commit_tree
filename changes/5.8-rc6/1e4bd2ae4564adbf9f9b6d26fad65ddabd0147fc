perf jit: Fix inaccurate DWARF line table

Fix an issue where addresses in the DWARF line table are offset by -0x40
(GEN_ELF_TEXT_OFFSET). This can be seen with `objdump -S` on the ELF
files after perf inject.

Without too much knowledge this looks good to me. The original code came
from oprofile's jit support:
