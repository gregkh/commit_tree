habanalabs: don't allow hard reset with open processes

When the MMU is heavily used by the engines, unmapping might take a lot of
time due to a full MMU cache invalidation done as part of the unmap flow.
Hence we might not be able to kill all open processes before going to hard
reset the device, as it involves unmapping of all user memory.
In case of a failure in killing all open processes, we should stop the
hard reset flow as it might lead to a kernel crash - one thread (killing
of a process) is updating MMU structures that other thread (hard reset) is
freeing.
Stopping a hard reset flow leaves the device as nonoperational and the
user can then initiate a hard reset via sysfs to reinitialize the device.
