ice: refactor filter functions

Move filter functions to separate file.

Add functions that prepare suitable ice_fltr_info struct
depending on the filter type and add this struct to earlier created
list:
- ice_fltr_add_mac_to_list
- ice_fltr_add_vlan_to_list
- ice_fltr_add_eth_to_list
This functions are used in adding and removing filters.

Create wrappers for functions mentioned above that alloc list,
add suitable ice_fltr_info to it and call add or remove function.
- ice_fltr_prepare_mac
- ice_fltr_prepare_mac_and_broadcast
- ice_fltr_prepare_vlan
- ice_fltr_prepare_eth
