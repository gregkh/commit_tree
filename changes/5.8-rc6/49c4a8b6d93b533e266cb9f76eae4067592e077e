drm/amd/display: fix typo

[why]
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_HDCP1_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION and
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_HDCP2_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION were supposed to be
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_HDCP1_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION_FAILURE and
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_HDCP2_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION_FAILURE. Because of this
it always seems like mod_hdcp_hdcp1_enable_encryption
and mod_hdcp_hdcp2_enable_encryption are always passing

[how]
rename the elements to what they were supposed to be called
