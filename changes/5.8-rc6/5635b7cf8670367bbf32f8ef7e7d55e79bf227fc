drm/mgag200: Use managed mode-config initialization

Mode configuration is now cleanued up automatically. While at it,
move all mode-config code into mgag200_mode.c. Done in preparation
of switching mgag200 to simple-KMS helpers.

v2:
	* improve commit message (Sam)
	* rebased during cherry pick
	* also move bpp_shift initialization
