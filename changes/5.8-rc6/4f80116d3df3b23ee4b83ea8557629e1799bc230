net: ipv4: add sysctl for nexthop api compatibility mode

Current route nexthop API maintains user space compatibility
with old route API by default. Dumps and netlink notifications
support both new and old API format. In systems which have
moved to the new API, this compatibility mode cancels some
of the performance benefits provided by the new nexthop API.

This patch adds new sysctl nexthop_compat_mode which is on
by default but provides the ability to turn off compatibility
mode allowing systems to run entirely with the new routing
API. Old route API behaviour and support is not modified by this
sysctl.

Uses a single sysctl to cover both ipv4 and ipv6 following
other sysctls. Covers dumps and delete notifications as
suggested by David Ahern.
