net: vmxnet3: fix possible buffer overflow caused by bad DMA value in vmxnet3_get_rss()

The value adapter->rss_conf is stored in DMA memory, and it is assigned
to rssConf, so rssConf->indTableSize can be modified at anytime by
malicious hardware. Because rssConf->indTableSize is assigned to n,
buffer overflow may occur when the code "rssConf->indTable[n]" is
executed.

To fix this possible bug, n is checked after being used.
