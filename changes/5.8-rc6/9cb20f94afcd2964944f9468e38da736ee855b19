fs/ext4: Make DAX mount option a tri-state

We add 'always', 'never', and 'inode' (default).  '-o dax' continues to
operate the same which is equivalent to 'always'.  This new
functionality is limited to ext4 only.

Specifically we introduce a 2nd DAX mount flag EXT4_MOUNT2_DAX_NEVER and set
it and EXT4_MOUNT_DAX_ALWAYS appropriately for the mode.

We also force EXT4_MOUNT2_DAX_NEVER if !CONFIG_FS_DAX.

Finally, EXT4_MOUNT2_DAX_INODE is used solely to detect if the user
specified that option for printing.
