compiler/gcc: Raise minimum GCC version for kernel builds to 4.8

It is very rare to see versions of GCC prior to 4.8 being used to build
the mainline kernel. These old compilers are also know to have codegen

Raise the minimum GCC version for kernel build to 4.8 and remove some
tautological Kconfig dependencies as a consequence.
