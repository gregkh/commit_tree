media: ti-vpe: cal: improve enable_irqs

IRQENABLE_SET registers are (usually) not meant to be read, only written
to. The current driver needlessly uses read-modify-write cycle to enable
IRQ bits.

The read-modify-write has no bad side effects here, but it's still
better to clean this up by only using write.
