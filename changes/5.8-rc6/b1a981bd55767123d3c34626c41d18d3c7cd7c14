drm/udl: drop drm_driver.release hook

There's only two functions called from that:
drm_kms_helper_poll_fini() and udl_free_urb_list(). Both of these are
also called from the ubs_driver->disconnect hook, so entirely
pointless to do the same again in the ->release hook.

Furthermore by the time we clean up the drm_driver we really shouldn't
be touching hardware anymore, so stopping the poll worker and freeing
the urb allocations in ->disconnect is the right thing to do.

Now disconnect still cleans things up before unregistering the driver,
but that's a different issue.

v2: Use _fini, not _disable in unplug, motivated by discussions with
Thomas. _disable/_enable are for suspend/resume.
