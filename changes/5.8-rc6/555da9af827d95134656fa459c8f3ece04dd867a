net/smc: add event-based llc_flow framework

The new framework allows to start specific types of LLC control flows,
protects active flows and makes it possible to wait for flows to finish
before starting a new flow.
This mechanism is used for the LLC control layer to model flows like
'add link' or 'delete link' which need to send/receive several LLC
messages and are not allowed to get interrupted by the wrong type of
messages.
'Add link' or 'Delete link' messages arriving in the middle of a flow
are delayed and processed when the current flow finished.
