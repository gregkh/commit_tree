mm/page_alloc: integrate classzone_idx and high_zoneidx

classzone_idx is just different name for high_zoneidx now.  So, integrate
them and add some comment to struct alloc_context in order to reduce
future confusion about the meaning of this variable.

The accessor, ac_classzone_idx() is also removed since it isn't needed
after integration.

In addition to integration, this patch also renames high_zoneidx to
highest_zoneidx since it represents more precise meaning.
