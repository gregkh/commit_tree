dt-bindings: do not build processed-schema.yaml for 'make dt_binding_check'

Currently, processed-schema.yaml is always built, but it is actually
used only for 'make dtbs_check'.

'make dt_binding_check' uses processed-schema-example.yaml instead.

Build processed-schema.yaml only for 'make dtbs_check'.
