exec: Make unlocking exec_update_mutex explict

With install_exec_creds updated to follow immediately after
setup_new_exec, the failure of unshare_sighand is the only
code path where exec_update_mutex is held but not explicitly
unlocked.

Update that code path to explicitly unlock exec_update_mutex.

Remove the unlocking of exec_update_mutex from free_bprm.
