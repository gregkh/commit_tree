powerpc/mm: Refactor pte_update() on book3s/32

When CONFIG_PTE_64BIT is set, pte_update() operates on
'unsigned long long'
When CONFIG_PTE_64BIT is not set, pte_update() operates on
'unsigned long'

In asm/page.h, we have pte_basic_t which is 'unsigned long long'
when CONFIG_PTE_64BIT is set and 'unsigned long' otherwise.

Refactor pte_update() using pte_basic_t.

While we are at it, drop the comment on 44x which is not applicable
to book3s version of pte_update().
