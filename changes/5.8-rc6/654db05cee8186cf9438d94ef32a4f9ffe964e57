rcu: Use data_race() for RCU expedited CPU stall-warning prints

Although the accesses used to determine whether or not an expedited
stall should be printed are an integral part of the concurrency algorithm
governing use of the corresponding variables, the values that are simply
printed are ancillary.  As such, it is best to use data_race() for these
accesses in order to provide the greatest latitude in the use of KCSAN
for the other accesses that are an integral part of the algorithm.  This
commit therefore changes the relevant uses of READ_ONCE() to data_race().
