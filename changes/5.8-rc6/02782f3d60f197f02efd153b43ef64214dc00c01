iommu/arm-smmu: Make remove callback message more informative

Currently on reboot/shutdown, the following messages are
displayed on the console as error messages before the
system reboots/shutdown as part of remove callback.

On SC7180:

  arm-smmu 15000000.iommu: removing device with active domains!
  arm-smmu 5040000.iommu: removing device with active domains!

Make this error message more informative and less scary.
