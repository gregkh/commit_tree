mwifiex: Fix memory corruption in dump_station

The mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_station() uses static variable for iterating
over a linked list of all associated stations (when the driver is in UAP
role). This has a race condition if .dump_station is called in parallel
for multiple interfaces. This corruption can be triggered by registering
multiple SSIDs and calling, in parallel for multiple interfaces
    iw dev <iface> station dump

This patch drops the use of the static iterator, and instead every time
the function is called iterates to the idx-th position of the
linked-list.

It would be better to convert the code not to use linked list for
associated stations storage (since the chip has a limited number of
associated stations anyway - it could just be an array). Such a change
may be proposed in the future. In the meantime this patch can backported
into stable kernels in this simple form.
