ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix generic hda codec support

Add support for using generic codec driver with SOF. Generic driver
is used if:
 - snd_sof_intel_hda_common.hda_model="generic" is set, or
 - fallback if no other codec driver is found

The implementation is aligned with snd-hda-intel driver, and fixes audio
support for systems like Acer Swift 3 SF314-57G, on which this issue was
originally reported.
