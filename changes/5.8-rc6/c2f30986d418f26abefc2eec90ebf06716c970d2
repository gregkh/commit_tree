clk: sprd: return correct type of value for _sprd_pll_recalc_rate

The function _sprd_pll_recalc_rate() defines return value to unsigned
long, but it would return a negative value when malloc fail, changing
to return its parent_rate makes more sense, since if the callback
.recalc_rate() is not set, the framework returns the parent_rate as
well.
