net: remove newlines in NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD

The NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD macro is used to report a string describing an
error message to userspace via the netlink extended ACK structure. It
should not have a trailing newline.

Add a cocci script which catches cases where the newline marker is
present. Using this script, fix the handful of cases which accidentally
included a trailing new line.

I couldn't figure out a way to get a patch mode working, so this script
only implements context, report, and org.
