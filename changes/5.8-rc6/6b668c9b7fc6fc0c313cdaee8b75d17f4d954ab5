io_uring: don't submit sqes when ctx->refs is dying

When IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL is enabled, io_ring_ctx_wait_and_kill() will wait
for sq thread to idle by busy loop:

    while (ctx->sqo_thread && !wq_has_sleeper(&ctx->sqo_wait))
        cond_resched();

Above loop isn't very CPU friendly, it may introduce a short cpu burst on
the current cpu.

If ctx->refs is dying, we forbid sq_thread from submitting any further
SQEs. Instead they just get discarded when we exit.
