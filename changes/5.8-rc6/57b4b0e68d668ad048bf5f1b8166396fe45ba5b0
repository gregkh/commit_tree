staging: vt6656: vnt_rxtx_rsvtime_le16 to use ieee80211_generic_frame_duration.

ieee80211_generic_frame_duration is the mac80211 equivalent to
vnt_get_rsvtime use this to get our frame time.

There is a change where there is rrv_time_a and rrv_time_b
the frame duration is always the same so both are equal.
