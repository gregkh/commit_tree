mmc: sdio: Align the initialization commands in retry path for UHS-I

According to the comment in mmc_sdio_reinit_card(), some SDIO cards may
require a "[CMD5,5,3,7] init sequence", which isn't always obeyed in
mmc_sdio_init_card(). Especially, when we end up retrying the UHS-I
specific initialization, there is a missing CMD5.

Let's update the code to make the behaviour consistent and let's also take
the opportunity to clean up the code a bit, to avoid open coding.
