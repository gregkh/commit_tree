clocksource/drivers/timer-microchip-pit64b: Select CONFIG_TIMER_OF

This driver is an OF driver, it depends on OF, and uses
TIMER_OF_DECLARE, so it should select CONFIG_TIMER_OF.

Without CONFIG_TIMER_OF enabled this can lead to warnings such as:

  powerpc-linux-ld: warning: orphan section `__timer_of_table' from
  `drivers/clocksource/timer-microchip-pit64b.o' being placed in
  section `__timer_of_table'.

Because TIMER_OF_TABLES in vmlinux.lds.h doesn't emit anything into
the linker script when CONFIG_TIMER_OF is not enabled.
