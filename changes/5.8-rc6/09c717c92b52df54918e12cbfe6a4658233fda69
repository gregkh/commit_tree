arm64: Add missing sentinel to erratum_1463225

When the erratum_1463225 array was introduced a sentinel at the end was
missing thus causing a KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in
is_affected_midr_range_list on arm64 error.

Fixes: a9e821b89daa ("arm64: Add KRYO4XX gold CPU cores to erratum list 1463225 and 1418040")
