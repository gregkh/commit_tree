r8169: change wmb to smb_wmb in rtl8169_start_xmit

A barrier is needed here to ensure that rtl_tx sees the descriptor
changes (DescOwn set) before the updated tp->cur_tx value. Else it may
wrongly assume that the transfer has been finished already. For this
purpose smp_wmb() is sufficient.

No separate barrier is needed for ordering the descriptor changes
with the MMIO doorbell write. The needed barrier is included in
the non-relaxed writel() used by rtl8169_doorbell().
