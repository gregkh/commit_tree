nvme-rdma: assign completion vector correctly

The completion vector index that is given during CQ creation can't
exceed the number of support vectors by the underlying RDMA device. This
violation currently can accure, for example, in case one will try to
connect with N regular read/write queues and M poll queues and the sum
of N + M > num_supported_vectors. This will lead to failure in establish
a connection to remote target. Instead, in that case, share a completion
vector between queues.
