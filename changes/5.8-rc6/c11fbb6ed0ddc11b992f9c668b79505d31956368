btrfs: reduce lock contention when creating snapshot

When creating a snapshot, ordered extents need to be flushed and this
can take a long time.

In create_snapshot there are two locks held when this happens:

  1. Destination directory inode lock
  2. Global subvolume semaphore

This will unnecessarily block other operations like subvolume destroy,
create, or setflag until the snapshot is created.

We can fix that by moving the flush outside the locked section as this
does not depend on the aforementioned locks.  The code factors out the
snapshot related work from create_snapshot to btrfs_mksnapshot.

__btrfs_ioctl_snap_create
  btrfs_mksubvol
    create_subvol
  btrfs_mksnapshot
    <flush>
    btrfs_mksubvol
      create_snapshot
