media: imx: Fix some pixel format selections

- imx_media_capture_device_register() needs to use CS_SEL_ANY when
  finding the format from the attached source subdevice, because the
  source can be a CSI which supports bayer, and the CSI may have selected
  a bayer format when it registered.

- Likewise, imx_media_init_mbus_fmt() is called from the CSI, so the
  function may be passed a bayer code. Use CS_SEL_ANY when locating
  the format.
