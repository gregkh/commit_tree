ice: Allow VF to request reset as soon as it's initialized

A VF driver has the ability to request reset via VIRTCHNL_OP_RESET_VF.
This is a required step in VF driver load. Currently, the PF is only
allowing a VF to request reset using this method after the VF has
already communicated resources via VIRTCHNL_OP_GET_VF_RESOURCES.
However, this is incorrect because the VF can request reset before
requesting resources. Fix this by allowing the VF to request a reset
once it has been initialized.
