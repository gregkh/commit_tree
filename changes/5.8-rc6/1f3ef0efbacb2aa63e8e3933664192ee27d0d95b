drm/amdgpu: add uncorrectable error count print in UMC ecc irq cb

Uncorrectable error count printing is missed when issuing UMC
UE injection. When going to the error count log function in GPU
recover work thread, there is no chance to get correct error count
value by last error injection and print, because the error status
register is automatically cleared after reading in UMC ecc irq
callback. So add such message printing in UMC ecc irq cb to be
consistent with other RAS error interrupt cases.
