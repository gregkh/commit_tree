ovl: use only uppermetacopy state in ovl_lookup()

Currently we use a variable "metacopy" which signifies that dentry could be
either uppermetacopy or lowermetacopy.  Amir suggested that we can move
code around and use d.metacopy in such a way that we don't need
lowermetacopy and just can do away with uppermetacopy.

So this patch replaces "metacopy" with "uppermetacopy".

It also moves some code little higher to keep reading little simpler.
