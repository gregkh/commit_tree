m68k: nommu: register start of the memory with memblock

The m68k nommu setup code didn't register the beginning of the physical
memory with memblock because it was anyway occupied by the kernel. However,
commit fa3354e4ea39 ("mm: free_area_init: use maximal zone PFNs rather than
zone sizes") changed zones initialization to use memblock.memory to detect
the zone extents and this caused inconsistency between zone PFNs and the
actual PFNs:

Adjust the memory registration with memblock to include the beginning of
the physical memory and make sure that the area occupied by the kernel is
marked as reserved.
