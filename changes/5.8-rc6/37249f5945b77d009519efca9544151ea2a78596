samples: connector: build sample program for target architecture

This userspace program includes UAPI headers exported to usr/include/.
'make headers' always works for the target architecture (i.e. the same
architecture as the kernel), so the sample program should be built for
the target as well. Kbuild now supports 'userprogs' for that.

$(CC) can always compile cn_text.o since it is the kenrel-space code,
but building ucon requires libc.

I guarded it by:

  always-$(CONFIG_CC_CAN_LINK) := $(userprogs)
