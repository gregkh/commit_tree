media: imx: utils: Handle Bayer format lookup through a selection flag

The format lookup (and enumeration) functions take a boolean flag to
tell if Bayer formats should be considered. This leads to hard to read
lines such as

	return enum_format(fourcc, NULL, index, cs_sel, true, false);

where the boolean parameters can easily be mixed. To make the code
clearer, add a CS_SEL_BAYER flag that can be passed through the
codespace_sel parameter of the lookup functions to replace the bool
parameter.

[slongerbeam@gmail.com: Instead of declaring CS_SEL_ANY as a bitfield
 containing only CS_SEL_YUV | CS_SEL_RGB, declare CS_SEL_ANY as all of
 the above (YUV, RGB, BAYER). A new enum is declared for the YUV | RGB
 selection as CS_SEL_YUV_RGB, and that is used by sub-devices that
 don't support BAYER and only allow selecting and enumerating YUV or RGB
 encodings. CS_SEL_ANY is now only used by the CSI sub-devices and the
 attached capture interfaces, since only those devices support BAYER
 formats.]
