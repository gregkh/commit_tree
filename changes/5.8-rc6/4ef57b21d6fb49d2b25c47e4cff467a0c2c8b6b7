recordmcount: support >64k sections

When compiling a kernel with Clang and LTO, we need to run
recordmcount on vmlinux.o with a large number of sections, which
currently fails as the program doesn't understand extended
section indexes. This change adds support for processing binaries
with >64k sections.
