PCI: endpoint: Add support to handle multiple base for mapping outbound memory

R-Car PCIe controller has support to map multiple memory regions for
mapping the outbound memory in local system also the controller limits
single allocation for each region (that is, once a chunk is used from the
region it cannot be used to allocate a new one). This features inspires to
add support for handling multiple memory bases in endpoint framework.

With this patch pci_epc_mem_init() initializes address space for endpoint
controller which support single window and pci_epc_multi_mem_init()
initializes multiple windows supported by endpoint controller.
