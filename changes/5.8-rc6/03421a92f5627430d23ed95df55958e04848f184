samples/bpf: Remove compiler warnings

Commit 5fbc220862fc ("tools/libpf: Add offsetof/container_of macro
in bpf_helpers.h") added macros offsetof/container_of to
bpf_helpers.h. Unfortunately, it caused compilation warnings
below for a few samples/bpf programs:

In all these cases, bpf_helpers.h is included first, followed by other
standard headers. The macro container_of is defined unconditionally
in kernel.h, causing the compiler warning.

The fix is to move bpf_helpers.h after standard headers.
