staging: mt7621-pci: rename 'PCIE_P2P_MAX' into 'PCIE_P2P_CNT'

Definition 'PCIE_P2P_MAX' is '3'. The value here is not a MAXimum.
It is a count or a number. It is how many masks there are.
The masks are numbered 0, 1, 2 so the maximum is 2. Hence rename
variable into 'PCIE_P2P_CNT' which is a more accurate name.
