xen: Move xen_setup_callback_vector() definition to include/xen/hvm.h

Kbuild test robot reports the following problem on ARM:

  for 'xen_setup_callback_vector' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
1664 | void xen_setup_callback_vector(void) {}
|      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The problem is that xen_setup_callback_vector is a x86 only thing, its
definition is present in arch/x86/xen/xen-ops.h but not on ARM. In
events_base.c there is a stub for !CONFIG_XEN_PVHVM but it is not declared
as 'static'.

On x86 the situation is hardly better: drivers/xen/events/events_base.c
doesn't include 'xen-ops.h' from arch/x86/xen/, it includes its namesake
from include/xen/ which also results in a 'no previous prototype' warning.

Currently, xen_setup_callback_vector() has two call sites: one in
drivers/xen/events_base.c and another in arch/x86/xen/suspend_hvm.c. The
former is placed under #ifdef CONFIG_X86 and the later is only compiled
in when CONFIG_XEN_PVHVM.

Resolve the issue by moving xen_setup_callback_vector() declaration to
arch neutral 'include/xen/hvm.h' as the implementation lives in arch
neutral drivers/xen/events/events_base.c.
