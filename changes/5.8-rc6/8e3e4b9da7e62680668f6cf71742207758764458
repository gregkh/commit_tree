iavf: increase reset complete wait time

With an increased number of VFs, it's possible to encounter the following
issue during reset.

    iavf b8d4:00:02.0: Hardware reset detected
    iavf b8d4:00:02.0: Reset never finished (0)
    iavf b8d4:00:02.0: Reset task did not complete, VF disabled

Increase the reset complete wait count to allow for 128 VFs to complete
reset.
