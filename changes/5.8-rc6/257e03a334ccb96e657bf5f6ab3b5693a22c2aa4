platform/x86: dell-laptop: don't register micmute LED if there is no token

On Dell G3-3590, error message is issued during boot up,
"platform::micmute: Setting an LED's brightness failed (-19)",
but there's no micmute led on the machine.

Get the related tokens of SMBIOS, GLOBAL_MIC_MUTE_DISABLE/ENABLE.
If one of two tokens doesn't exist,
don't call led_classdev_register() for platform::micmute.
After that, you wouldn't see the platform::micmute in /sys/class/leds/,
and the error message wouldn't see in dmesg.
