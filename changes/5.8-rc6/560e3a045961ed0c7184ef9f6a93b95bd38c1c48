bus: mhi: core: Handle firmware load using state worker

Upon power up, driver queues firmware worker thread if the execution
environment is PBL. Firmware worker is blocked with a timeout until
state worker gets a chance to run and unblock firmware worker. An
endpoint power up failure can be seen if state worker gets a chance to
run after firmware worker has timed out. Remove this dependency and
handle firmware load directly using state worker thread.
