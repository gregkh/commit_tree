drm/i915: work around false-positive maybe-uninitialized warning

gcc-9 gets confused by the code flow in check_dirty_whitelist:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/selftest_workarounds.c: In function 'check_dirty_whitelist':
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/selftest_workarounds.c:492:17: error: 'rsvd' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

I could not figure out a good way to do this in a way that gcc
understands better, so initialize the variable to zero, as last
resort.
