Bluetooth: btbcm: Make btbcm_setup_patchram use btbcm_finalize

On UART attached devices we do:

1. btbcm_initialize()
2. Setup UART baudrate, etc.
3. btbcm_finalize()

After our previous changes we can now also use btbcm_finalize() from
the btbcm_setup_patchram() function used on USB devices without any
functional changes. This completes unifying the USB and UART paths
as much as possible.
