mtd: spi-nor: Add support for s25fs128s1

Add support for Cypress s25fs128s1 flash. Previously the flash is
decoded as s25fl129p1 by mistake.

Add it in the flash info list to correctly decode. The flash also
needs a fixup for s25fs-s family. Further capability of the flash will
be parsed from bfpt.

The flash has been tested under SPI/DUAL/QUAD mode on hisi-sfc-v3xx
controller, all the write/read/erase works well.
