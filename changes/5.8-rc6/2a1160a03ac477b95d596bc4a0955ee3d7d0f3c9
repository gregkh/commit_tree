lpfc: Refactor lpfc nvme headers

A lot of files in lpfc include nvme headers, building up relationships that
require a file to change for its headers when there is no other change
necessary. It would be better to localize the nvme headers.

There is also no need for separate nvme (initiator) and nvmet (tgt)
header files.

Refactor the inclusion of nvme headers so that all nvme items are
included by lpfc_nvme.h

Merge lpfc_nvmet.h into lpfc_nvme.h so that there is a single header used
by both the nvme and nvmet sides. This prepares for structure sharing
between the two roles. Prep to add shared function prototypes for upcoming
shared routines.
