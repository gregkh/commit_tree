dt-bindings: i2c: Convert DW I2C slave to the DW I2C master example

dtc currently doesn't support I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS flag set in the
i2c "reg" property. If dtc finds an i2c-slave sub-node having an address
higher than ten-bits wide it'll print an ugly warning:

Warning (i2c_bus_reg): /example-2/i2c@1120000/eeprom@64: I2C bus unit address format error, expected "40000064"
Warning (i2c_bus_reg): /example-2/i2c@1120000/eeprom@64:reg: I2C address must be less than 10-bits, got "0x40000064"

In order to silence dtc up let's replace the corresponding DT binding
example with a normal DW I2C master mode-based one. It's done by clearing
the I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS bit in the reg property and converting the
sub-node to be compatible with normal EEPROM like "atmel,24c02".

Just revert this commit when dtc is fixed.
