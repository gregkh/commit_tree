powerpc: Remove Xilinx PPC405/PPC440 support

The latest Xilinx design tools called ISE and EDK has been released in
October 2013. New tool doesn't support any PPC405/PPC440 new designs.
These platforms are no longer supported and tested.

PowerPC 405/440 port is orphan from 2013 by
commit cdeb89943bfc ("MAINTAINERS: Fix incorrect status tag") and
commit 19624236cce1 ("MAINTAINERS: Update Grant's email address and maintainership")
that's why it is time to remove the support fot these platforms.
