interconnect: Add helpers for enabling/disabling a path

There is a repeated pattern in multiple drivers where they want to switch
the bandwidth between zero and some other value. This is happening often
in the suspend/resume callbacks. Let's add helper functions to enable and
disable the path, so that callers don't have to take care of remembering
the bandwidth values and handle this in the framework instead.

With this patch the users can call icc_disable() and icc_enable() to lower
their bandwidth request to zero and then restore it back to it's previous
value.
