net/mlx5: Refactor mlx5_accel_esp_create_hw_context parameter list

Currently the FPGA IPsec is the only hw implementation of the IPsec
acceleration api, and so the mlx5_accel_esp_create_hw_context was
wrongly made to suit this HW api, among other in its parameter list
and some of its parameter endianness.

This implementation might not be suitable for different HW.

Refactor by group and pass all function arguments of
mlx5_accel_esp_create_hw_context in common mlx5_accel_esp_xfrm_attrs
struct field of mlx5_accel_esp_xfrm struct and correct the endianness
according to the HW being called.
