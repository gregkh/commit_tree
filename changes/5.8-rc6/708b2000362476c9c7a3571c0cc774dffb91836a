PCI/AER: Remove HEST/FIRMWARE_FIRST parsing for AER ownership

Commit c100beb9ccfb ("PCI/AER: Use only _OSC to determine AER ownership")
removed the use of HEST in determining AER ownership, but the AER driver
still used HEST to verify AER ownership in some of its APIs.

Per the ACPI spec v6.3, sec 18.3.2.4, some HEST table entries contain a
FIRMWARE_FIRST bit, but that bit does not tell us anything about ownership
of the AER capability.

Remove parsing of HEST to look for FIRMWARE_FIRST.

Add pcie_aer_is_native() for the places that need to know whether the OS
owns the AER capability.
