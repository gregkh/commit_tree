ASoC: SOF: Intel: change trigger sequence to fix pop noise when stopping playback on sdw platforms

Now the trigger sequence is set to SND_SOC_DPCM_TRIGGER_POST for
SOF. This means FE will be stopped before BE, so BE will consume
invalid data and this generates huge pop noise. This sequence is
introduced for HDA DAI which requires SND_SOC_DPCM_TRIGGER_POST for
some reasons. Now set default trigger sequence to SND_SOC_DPCM_TRIGGER_PRE
for playback with all DAI and fix sequence only for HDA DAI.

Fully tested on Comet Lake for a few cycles.
