platform/x86: asus_wmi: Reserve more space for struct bias_args

On the ASUS laptop UX325JA/UX425JA, most of the media keys are not
working due to the ASUS WMI driver fails to be loaded. The ACPI error
as follows leads to the failure of asus_wmi_evaluate_method.
  ACPI BIOS Error (bug): AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT, Field [IIA3] at bit offset/length 96/32 exceeds size of target Buffer (96 bits) (20200326/dsopcode-203)
  No Local Variables are initialized for Method [WMNB]
  ACPI Error: Aborting method \_SB.ATKD.WMNB due to previous error (AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT) (20200326/psparse-531)

The DSDT for the WMNB part shows that 5 DWORD required for local
variables and the 3rd variable IIA3 hit the buffer limit.

Method (WMNB, 3, Serialized)
{ ..
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, Zero, IIA0)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x04, IIA1)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x08, IIA2)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x0C, IIA3)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x10, IIA4)
    Local0 = (Arg1 & 0xFFFFFFFF)
    If ((Local0 == 0x54494E49))
  ..
}

The limitation is determined by the input acpi_buffer size passed
to the wmi_evaluate_method. Since the struct bios_args is the data
structure used as input buffer by default for all ASUS WMI calls,
the size needs to be expanded to fix the problem.
