virtio-mem: Allow to offline partially unplugged memory blocks

Dropping the reference count of PageOffline() pages during MEM_GOING_ONLINE
allows offlining code to skip them. However, we also have to clear
PG_reserved, because PG_reserved pages get detected as unmovable right
away. Take care of restoring the reference count when offlining is
canceled.

Clarify why we don't have to perform any action when unloading the
driver. Also, let's add a warning if anybody is still holding a
reference to unplugged pages when offlining.
