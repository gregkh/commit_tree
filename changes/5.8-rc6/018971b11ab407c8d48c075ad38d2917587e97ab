iwlwifi: mvm: add support for range request version 10

Range request version 10 keeps the same command size as version 9
but uses 2 reserved fields for the responder beacon interval and
station id (if exists).
For now, since the beacon interval of unassoc APs is unknown, use
a value of 100 TUs which is a common value for many APs.

While at it, remove the definition for CCMP_256 cipher, since this
is not supported.
