x86/retpoline: Fix retpoline unwind

Currently objtool cannot understand retpolines, and thus cannot
generate ORC unwind information for them. This means that we cannot
unwind from the middle of a retpoline.

The recent ANNOTATE_INTRA_FUNCTION_CALL and UNWIND_HINT_RET_OFFSET
support in objtool enables it to understand the basic retpoline
construct. A further problem is that the ORC unwind information is
alternative invariant; IOW. every alternative should have the same
ORC, retpolines obviously violate this. This means we need to
out-of-line them.

Since all GCC generated code already uses out-of-line retpolines, this
should not affect performance much, if anything.

This will enable objtool to generate valid ORC data for the
out-of-line copies, which means we can correctly and reliably unwind
through a retpoline.
