RDMA/srpt: Fix disabling device management

Avoid disabling device management for devices that don't support
Management datagrams (MADs) by checking if the "mad_agent" pointer is
initialized before calling ib_modify_port, also fix the error flow in
srpt_refresh_port() to disable device management if
ib_register_mad_agent() fail.
