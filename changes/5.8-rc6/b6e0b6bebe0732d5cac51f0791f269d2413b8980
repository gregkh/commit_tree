net/mlx5: Fix fatal error handling during device load

Currently, in case of fatal error during mlx5_load_one(), we cannot
enter error state until mlx5_load_one() is finished, what can take
several minutes until commands will get timeouts, because these commands
can't be processed due to the fatal error.
Fix it by setting dev->state as MLX5_DEVICE_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR before
requesting the lock.
