powerpc: Use a macro for creating instructions from u32s

In preparation for instructions having a more complex data type start
using a macro, ppc_inst(), for making an instruction out of a u32.  A
macro is used so that instructions can be used as initializer elements.
Currently this does nothing, but it will allow for creating a data type
that can represent prefixed instructions.
