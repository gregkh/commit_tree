libbpf: Fix probe code to return EPERM if encountered

When the probe code was failing for any reason ENOTSUP was returned, even
if this was due to not having enough lock space. This patch fixes this by
returning EPERM to the user application, so it can respond and increase
the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK size.
