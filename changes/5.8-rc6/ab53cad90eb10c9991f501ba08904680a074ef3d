bpf, netns: Keep a list of attached bpf_link's

To support multi-prog link-based attachments for new netns attach types, we
need to keep track of more than one bpf_link per attach type. Hence,
convert net->bpf.links into a list, that currently can be either empty or
have just one item.

Instead of reusing bpf_prog_list from bpf-cgroup, we link together
bpf_netns_link's themselves. This makes list management simpler as we don't
have to allocate, initialize, and later release list elements. We can do
this because multi-prog attachment will be available only for bpf_link, and
we don't need to build a list of programs attached directly and indirectly
via links.

No functional changes intended.
