kgdb: enable arch to support XML packet.

The XML packet could be supported by required architecture if the
architecture defines CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_KGDB_QXFER_PKT and implement its own
kgdb_arch_handle_qxfer_pkt(). Except for the kgdb_arch_handle_qxfer_pkt(),
the architecture also needs to record the feature supported by gdb stub
into the kgdb_arch_gdb_stub_feature, and these features will be reported
to host gdb when gdb stub receives the qSupported packet.
