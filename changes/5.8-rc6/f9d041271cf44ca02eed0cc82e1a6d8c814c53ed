bpf: Refactor bpf_link update handling

Make bpf_link update support more generic by making it into another
bpf_link_ops methods. This allows generic syscall handling code to be agnostic
to various conditionally compiled features (e.g., the case of
CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF). This also allows to keep link type-specific code to remain
static within respective code base. Refactor existing bpf_cgroup_link code and
take advantage of this.
