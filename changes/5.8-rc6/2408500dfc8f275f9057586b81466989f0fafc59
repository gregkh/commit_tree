KVM: nVMX: Truncate writes to vmcs.SYSENTER_EIP/ESP for 32-bit vCPU

Explicitly truncate the data written to vmcs.SYSENTER_EIP/ESP on WRMSR
if the virtual CPU doesn't support 64-bit mode.  The SYSENTER address
fields in the VMCS are natural width, i.e. bits 63:32 are dropped if the
CPU doesn't support Intel 64 architectures.  This behavior is visible to
the guest after a VM-Exit/VM-Exit roundtrip, e.g. if the guest sets bits
63:32 in the actual MSR.
