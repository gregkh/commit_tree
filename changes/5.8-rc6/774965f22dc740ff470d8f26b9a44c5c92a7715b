brcmfmac: keep apsta enabled when AP starts with MCHAN feature

When starting station mode on wlan0 and AP mode on wlan1, the apsta will
be disabled and cause data stall on wlan0(station). The apsta feature
with MCHAN(Multi-Channel Concurrent) or RSDB(Real Simultaneous
Dual-Band) can make STA+AP work on two bands concurrently.
Because of that, we keep apsta enabled if firmware supports MCHAN or
RSDB features
