net/smc: first part of add link processing as SMC client

First set of functions to process an ADD_LINK LLC request as an SMC
client. Find an alternate IB device, determine the new link group type
and get the index for the new link. Then ready the link, map the buffers
and send an ADD_LINK LLC response. If any error occurs, send a reject
LLC message and terminate the processing.
Add smc_llc_alloc_alt_link() to find a free link index for a new link,
depending on the new link group type.
