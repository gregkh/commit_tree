net/smc: add new link state and related helpers

Before a link can be reused it must have been cleared. Lowest current
link state is INACTIVE, which does not mean that the link is already
cleared.
Add a new state UNUSED that is set when the link is cleared and can be
reused.
Add helper smc_llc_usable_link() to find an active link in a link group,
and smc_link_usable() to determine if a link is usable.
