sched: Defend cfs and rt bandwidth quota against overflow

When users write some huge number into cpu.cfs_quota_us or
cpu.rt_runtime_us, overflow might happen during to_ratio() shifts of
schedulable checks.

to_ratio() could be altered to avoid unnecessary internal overflow, but
min_cfs_quota_period is less than 1 << BW_SHIFT, so a cutoff would still
be needed. Set a cap MAX_BW for cfs_quota_us and rt_runtime_us to
prevent overflow.
