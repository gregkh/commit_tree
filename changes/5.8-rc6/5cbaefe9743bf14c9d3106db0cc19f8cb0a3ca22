kcsan: Improve various small stylistic details

Tidy up a few bits:

  - Fix typos and grammar, improve wording.

  - Remove spurious newlines that are col80 warning artifacts where the
    resulting line-break is worse than the disease it's curing.

  - Use core kernel coding style to improve readability and reduce
    spurious code pattern variations.

  - Use better vertical alignment for structure definitions and initialization
    sequences.

  - Misc other small details.

No change in functionality intended.
