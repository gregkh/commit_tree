tcp: add tp->dup_ack_counter

In commit 86de5921a3d5 ("tcp: defer SACK compression after DupThresh")
I added a TCP_FASTRETRANS_THRESH bias to tp->compressed_ack in order
to enable sack compression only after 3 dupacks.

Since we plan to relax this rule for flows that involve
stacks not requiring this old rule, this patch adds
a distinct tp->dup_ack_counter.

This means the TCP_FASTRETRANS_THRESH value is now used
in a single location that a future patch can adjust:

	if (tp->dup_ack_counter < TCP_FASTRETRANS_THRESH) {
		tp->dup_ack_counter++;
		goto send_now;
	}

This patch also introduces tcp_sack_compress_send_ack()
helper to ease following patch comprehension.

This patch refines LINUX_MIB_TCPACKCOMPRESSED to not
count the acks that we had to send if the timer expires
or tcp_sack_compress_send_ack() is sending an ack.
