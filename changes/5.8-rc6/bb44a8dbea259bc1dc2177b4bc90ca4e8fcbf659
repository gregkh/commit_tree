KVM: arm64: Move sysreg reset check to boot time

Our sysreg reset check has become a bit silly, as it only checks whether
a reset callback actually exists for a given sysreg entry, and apply the
method if available. Doing the check at each vcpu reset is pretty dumb,
as the tables never change. It is thus perfectly possible to do the same
checks at boot time.

This also allows us to introduce a sparse sys_regs[] array, something
that will be required with ARMv8.4-NV.
