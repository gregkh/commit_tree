media: cedrus: Program output format during each run

Previously, the output format was programmed as part of the ioctl()
handler. However, this has two problems:

  1) If there are multiple active streams with different output
     formats, the hardware will use whichever format was set last
     for both streams. Similarly, an ioctl() done in an inactive
     context will wrongly affect other active contexts.
  2) The registers are written while the device is not actively
     streaming. To enable runtime PM tied to the streaming state,
     all hardware access needs to be moved inside cedrus_device_run().

The call to cedrus_dst_format_set() is now placed just before the
codec-specific callback that programs the hardware.
