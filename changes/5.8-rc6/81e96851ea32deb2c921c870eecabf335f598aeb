x86: math-emu: Fix up 'cmp' insn for clang ias

The clang integrated assembler requires the 'cmp' instruction to
have a length prefix here:

arch/x86/math-emu/wm_sqrt.S:212:2: error: ambiguous instructions require an explicit suffix (could be 'cmpb', 'cmpw', or 'cmpl')
 cmp $0xffffffff,-24(%ebp)
 ^

Make this a 32-bit comparison, which it was clearly meant to be.
