i2c: algo-pca: Add 0x78 as SCL stuck low status for PCA9665

The PCA9665 datasheet says that I2CSTA = 78h indicates that SCL is stuck
low, this differs to the PCA9564 which uses 90h for this indication.
Treat either 0x78 or 0x90 as an indication that the SCL line is stuck.

Based on looking through the PCA9564 and PCA9665 datasheets this should
be safe for both chips. The PCA9564 should not return 0x78 for any valid
state and the PCA9665 should not return 0x90.
