xfs: use delete helper for items expected to be in AIL

Various intent log items call xfs_trans_ail_remove() with a log I/O
error shutdown type, but this helper historically checks whether an
item is in the AIL before calling xfs_trans_ail_delete(). This means
the shutdown check is essentially a no-op for users of
xfs_trans_ail_remove().

It is possible that some items might not be AIL resident when the
AIL remove attempt occurs, but this should be isolated to cases
where the filesystem has already shutdown. For example, this
includes abort of the transaction committing the intent and I/O
error of the iclog buffer committing the intent to the log.
Therefore, update these callsites to use xfs_trans_ail_delete() to
provide AIL state validation for the common path of items being
released and removed when associated done items commit to the
physical log.
