mm: clarify __GFP_MEMALLOC usage

It seems that the existing documentation is not explicit about the
expected usage and potential risks enough.  While it is calls out that
users have to free memory when using this flag it is not really apparent
that users have to careful to not deplete memory reserves and that they
should implement some sort of throttling wrt.  freeing process.

This is partly based on Neil's explanation [1].

Let's also call out that a pre allocated pool allocator should be
considered.
