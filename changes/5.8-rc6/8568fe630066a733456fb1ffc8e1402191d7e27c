media: atomisp: print a better message when fw version is wrong

The printed message when a firmware version is wrong says nothing
usefull:

	atomisp-isp2 0000:00:03.0: Fw version check failed.
	atomisp-isp2: probe of 0000:00:03.0 failed with error -22

Print the expected and the received firmware version instead.

In order to do that, the firmware functions will need at least
a struct device pointer, so pass it.

While writing this patch, it was noticed that some of the
abstraction layers of this driver have functions that are never
called, but use this interface. Get rid of them.
