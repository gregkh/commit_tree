net: phy: mscc-miim: read poll when high resolution timers are disabled

The driver uses a read polling mechanism to check the status of the MDIO
bus, to know if it is ready to accept next commands. This polling
mechanism uses usleep_delay() under the hood between reads which is fine
as long as high resolution timers are enabled. Otherwise the delays will
end up to be much longer than expected.

This patch fixes this by using udelay() under the hood when
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS isn't enabled. This increases CPU usage.
