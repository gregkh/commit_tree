KVM: arm64: BTI: Reset BTYPE when skipping emulated instructions

Since normal execution of any non-branch instruction resets the
PSTATE BTYPE field to 0, so do the same thing when emulating a
trapped instruction.

Branches don't trap directly, so we should never need to assign a
non-zero value to BTYPE here.
