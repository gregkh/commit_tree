btrfs: put direct I/O checksums in btrfs_dio_private instead of bio

The next commit will get rid of btrfs_dio_private->orig_bio. The only
thing we really need it for is containing all of the checksums, but we
can easily put the checksum array in btrfs_dio_private and have the
submitted bios reference the array. We can also look the checksums up
while we're setting up instead of the current awkward logic that looks
them up for orig_bio when the first split bio is submitted.

(Interestingly, btrfs_dio_private did contain the
checksums before commit 23ea8e5a0767 ("Btrfs: load checksum data once
when submitting a direct read io"), but it didn't look them up up
front.)
