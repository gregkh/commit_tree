bpf: Add xdp.frame_sz in bpf_prog_test_run_xdp().

Update the memory requirements, when adding xdp.frame_sz in BPF test_run
function bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() which e.g. is used by XDP selftests.

Specifically add the expected reserved tailroom, but also allocated a
larger memory area to reflect that XDP frames usually comes in this
format. Limit the provided packet data size to 4096 minus headroom +
tailroom, as this also reflect a common 3520 bytes MTU limit with XDP.

Note that bpf_test_init already use a memory allocation method that clears
memory.  Thus, this already guards against leaking uninit kernel memory.
