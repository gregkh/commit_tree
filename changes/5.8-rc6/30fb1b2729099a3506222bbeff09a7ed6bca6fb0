brcmfmac: use actframe_abort to cancel ongoing action frame

The driver sends an action frame down and waits for dwell time to be
completed or aborted before sending out the next action frame.
Driver issues "scan abort" to cancel the current time slot, but this
doesn't have any effect because, we are not using scan engine for
sending action frame.
Fix is to use "actframe_abort" to cancels the current action frame.
