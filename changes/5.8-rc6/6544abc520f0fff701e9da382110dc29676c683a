opp: Increase parsed_static_opps in _of_add_opp_table_v1()

Currently, when using _of_add_opp_table_v2 parsed_static_opps is
increased and this value is used in _opp_remove_all_static() to
check if there are static opp entries that need to be freed.
Unfortunately this does not happen when using _of_add_opp_table_v1(),
which leads to warnings.

This patch increases parsed_static_opps in _of_add_opp_table_v1() in a
similar way as in _of_add_opp_table_v2().
