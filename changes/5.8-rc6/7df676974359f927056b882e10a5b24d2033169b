mm/memory.c: Update local TLB if PTE entry exists

If two threads concurrently fault at the same page, the thread that
won the race updates the PTE and its local TLB. For now, the other
thread gives up, simply does nothing, and continues.

It could happen that this second thread triggers another fault, whereby
it only updates its local TLB while handling the fault. Instead of
triggering another fault, let's directly update the local TLB of the
second thread. Function update_mmu_tlb is used here to update local
TLB on the second thread, and it is defined as empty on other arches.
