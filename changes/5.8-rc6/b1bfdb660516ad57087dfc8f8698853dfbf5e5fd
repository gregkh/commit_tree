MIPS: ingenic: DTS: Update GCW0 support

Add support for the face buttons, the ACT8600 PMUC, the LCD panel
with backlight, the rumble, internal/external SD readers, and other
things.

Note that the otg-phy node was dropped in the process as it was neither
useful nor used, and was inside a non-compliant board "bus".
