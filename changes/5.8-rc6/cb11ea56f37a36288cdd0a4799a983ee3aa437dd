usb: dwc3: gadget: Properly handle ClearFeature(halt)

DWC3 must not issue CLEAR_STALL command to control endpoints. The
controller automatically clears the STALL when it receives the SETUP
token. Also, when the driver receives ClearFeature(halt_ep), DWC3 must
stop any active transfer from the endpoint and give back all the
requests to the function drivers.
