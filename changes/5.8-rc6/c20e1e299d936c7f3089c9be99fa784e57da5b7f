powerpc/vas: Alloc and setup IRQ and trigger port address

Allocate a xive irq on each chip with a vas instance. The NX coprocessor
raises a host CPU interrupt via vas if it encounters page fault on user
space request buffer. Subsequent patches register the trigger port with
the NX coprocessor, and create a vas fault handler for this interrupt
mapping.
