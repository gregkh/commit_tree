exfat: call sync_filesystem for read-only remount

We need to commit dirty metadata and pages to disk
before remounting exfat as read-only.

This fixes a failure in xfstests generic/452

generic/452 does the following:
cp something <exfat>/
mount -o remount,ro <exfat>

the <exfat>/something is corrupted. because while
exfat is remounted as read-only, exfat doesn't
have a chance to commit metadata and
vfs invalidates page caches in a block device.
