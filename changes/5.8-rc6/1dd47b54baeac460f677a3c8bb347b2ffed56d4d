drm/i915: Add live selftests for indirect ctx batchbuffers

Indirect ctx batchbuffers are a hw feature of which
batch can be run, by hardware, during context restoration stage.
Driver can setup a batchbuffer and also an offset into the
context image. When context image is marshalled from
memory to registers, and when the offset from the start of
context register state is equal of what driver pre-determined,
batch will run. So one can manipulate context restoration
process at cacheline granularity, given some limitations,
as you need to have rudimentaries in place before you can
run a batch.

Add selftest which will write the ring start register
to a canary spot. This will test that hardware will run a
batchbuffer for the context in question.
