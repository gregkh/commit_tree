driver core: Update device link status correctly for SYNC_STATE_ONLY links

When SYNC_STATE_ONLY support was added in commit 05ef983e0d65 ("driver
core: Add device link support for SYNC_STATE_ONLY flag"),
SYNC_STATE_ONLY links were treated similar to STATELESS links in terms
of not blocking consumer probe if the supplier hasn't probed yet.

That caused a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link's status to not get updated.
Since SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link is no longer useful once the
consumer probes, commit 21c27f06587d ("driver core: Fix
SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link implementation") addresses the status
update issue by deleting the SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link instead of
complicating the status update code.

However, there are still some cases where we need to update the status
of a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link. This is because a SYNC_STATE_ONLY
device link can later get converted into a normal MANAGED device link
when a normal MANAGED device link is created between a supplier and
consumer that already have a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link between them.

If a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link's status isn't maintained correctly
till it's converted to a normal MANAGED device link, then the normal
MANAGED device link will end up with a wrong link status. This can cause
a warning stack trace[1] when the consumer device probes successfully.

This commit fixes the SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link status update issue
where it wouldn't transition correctly from DL_STATE_DORMANT or
DL_STATE_AVAILABLE to DL_STATE_CONSUMER_PROBE. It also resets the status
back to DL_STATE_DORMANT or DL_STATE_AVAILABLE if the consumer probe
fails.
