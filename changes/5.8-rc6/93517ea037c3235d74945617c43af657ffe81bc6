media: staging: media: atomisp: declare 'struct device' before using it

In some configurations, including this header leads to a warning:

drivers/staging/media/atomisp//pci/sh_css_firmware.h:41:38: error: declaration of 'struct device' will not be visible outside of this function [-Werror,-Wvisibility]

Make sure the struct tag is known before declaring a function
that uses it as an argument.
