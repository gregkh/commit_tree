KVM: x86: Replace late check_nested_events() hack with more precise fix

Add an argument to interrupt_allowed and nmi_allowed, to checking if
interrupt injection is blocked.  Use the hook to handle the case where
an interrupt arrives between check_nested_events() and the injection
logic.  Drop the retry of check_nested_events() that hack-a-fixed the
same condition.

Blocking injection is also a bit of a hack, e.g. KVM should do exiting
and non-exiting interrupt processing in a single pass, but it's a more
precise hack.  The old comment is also misleading, e.g. KVM_REQ_EVENT is
purely an optimization, setting it on every run loop (which KVM doesn't
do) should not affect functionality, only performance.

[Extend to SVM, add SMI and NMI.  Even though NMI and SMI cannot come
 asynchronously right now, making the fix generic is easy and removes a
 special case. - Paolo]
