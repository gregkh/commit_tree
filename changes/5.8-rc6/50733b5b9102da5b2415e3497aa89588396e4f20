media: add v4l2 JPEG helpers

Add helpers for JPEG header parsing. They allow both scanning for marker
segment positions and later parsing the segments individually, as
required by s5p-jpeg, as well as parsing all headers in one go, as
required by coda-vpu. The frame header is always parsed, as basically
all decoders are interested in width, height, and number of components.
For convenience, the JPEG chroma subsampling factors are decoded into a
v4l2_jpeg_chroma_subsampling enum.

Only baseline and extended sequential DCT encoded JPEGs with 8-bit or
12-bit precision with up to four components are supported.
