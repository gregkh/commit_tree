x86/32: Remove CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT

Make the doublefault exception handler unconditional on 32-bit. Yes,
it is important to be able to catch #DF exceptions instead of silent
reboots. Yes, the code size increase is worth every byte. And one less
CONFIG symbol is just the cherry on top.

No functional changes.
