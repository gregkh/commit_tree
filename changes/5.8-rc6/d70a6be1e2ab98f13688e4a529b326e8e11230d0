tools/bpf: Don't use $(COMPILE.c)

When using make kselftest TARGETS=bpf, tools/bpf is built with
MAKEFLAGS=rR, which causes $(COMPILE.c) to be undefined, which in turn
causes the build to fail with

  CC       kselftest/bpf/tools/build/bpftool/map_perf_ring.o
/bin/sh: 1: -MMD: not found

Fix by using $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c instead of $(COMPILE.c).
