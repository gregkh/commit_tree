elf: Allow arch to tweak initial mmap prot flags

An arch may want to tweak the mmap prot flags for an
ELFexecutable's initial mappings.  For example, arm64 is going to
need to add PROT_BTI for executable pages in an ELF process whose
executable is marked as using Branch Target Identification (an
ARMv8.5-A control flow integrity feature).

So that this can be done in a generic way, add a hook
arch_elf_adjust_prot() to modify the prot flags as desired: arches
can select CONFIG_HAVE_ELF_PROT and implement their own backend
where necessary.

By default, leave the prot flags unchanged.
