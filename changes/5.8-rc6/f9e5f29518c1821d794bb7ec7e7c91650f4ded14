uapi: habanalabs: add signal/wait operations

This is a pre-requisite to upstreaming GAUDI support.

Signal/wait operations are done by the user to perform sync between two
Primary Queues (PQs). The sync is done using the sync manager and it is
usually resolved inside the device, but sometimes it can be resolved in the
host, i.e. the user should be able to wait in the host until a signal has
been completed.

The mechanism to define signal and wait operations is done by the driver
because it needs atomicity and serialization, which is already done in the
driver when submitting work to the different queues.

To implement this feature, the driver "takes" a couple of h/w resources,
and this is reflected by the defines added to the uapi file.

The signal/wait operations are done via the existing CS IOCTL, and they use
the same data structure. There is a difference in the meaning of some of
the parameters, and for that we added unions to make the code more
readable.
