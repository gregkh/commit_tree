netns: enable to inherit devconf from current netns

The goal is to be able to inherit the initial devconf parameters from the
current netns, ie the netns where this new netns has been created.

This is useful in a containers environment where /proc/sys is read only.
For example, if a pod is created with specifics devconf parameters and has
the capability to create netns, the user expects to get the same parameters
than his 'init_net', which is not the real init_net in this case.
