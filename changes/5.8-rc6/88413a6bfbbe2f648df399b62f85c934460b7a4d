powerpc/spufs: fix copy_to_user while atomic

Currently, we may perform a copy_to_user (through
simple_read_from_buffer()) while holding a context's register_lock,
while accessing the context save area.

This change uses a temporary buffer for the context save area data,
which we then pass to simple_read_from_buffer.

Includes changes from Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>.
