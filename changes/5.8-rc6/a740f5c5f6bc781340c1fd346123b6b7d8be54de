drm/i915/selftests: Skip energy consumption tests if not controlling freq

If we can not manipulate the frequency with RPS, then comparing min/max
power consumption is pointless / misleading. We will leave the warning
about not being able to control the frequency selection via RPS to other
tests so as not to confuse this more specialised check.
