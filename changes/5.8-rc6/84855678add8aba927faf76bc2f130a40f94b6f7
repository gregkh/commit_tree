spi: Fix controller unregister order

When an SPI controller unregisters, it unbinds all its slave devices.
For this, their drivers may need to access the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce
interrupts.

However since commit ffbbdd21329f ("spi: create a message queueing
infrastructure"), spi_destroy_queue() is executed before unbinding the
slaves.  It sets ctlr->running = false, thereby preventing SPI bus
access and causing unbinding of slave devices to fail.

Fix by unbinding slaves before calling spi_destroy_queue().
