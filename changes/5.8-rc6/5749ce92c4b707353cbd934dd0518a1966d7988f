afs: Fix file locking

Fix AFS file locking to use the correct vnode pointer and remove a member
of the afs_operation struct that is never set, but it is read and followed,
causing an oops.

This can be triggered by:

	flock -s /afs/example.com/foo sleep 1

when it calls the kernel to get a file lock.
