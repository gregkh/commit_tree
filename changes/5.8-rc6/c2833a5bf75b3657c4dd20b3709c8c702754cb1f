hugetlbfs: fix changes to command line processing

Previously, a check for hugepages_supported was added before processing
hugetlb command line parameters.  On some architectures such as powerpc,
hugepages_supported() is not set to true until after command line
processing.  Therefore, no hugetlb command line parameters would be
accepted.

Remove the additional checks for hugepages_supported.  In hugetlb_init,
print a warning if !hugepages_supported and command line parameters were
specified.
