khugepaged: allow to collapse PTE-mapped compound pages

We can collapse PTE-mapped compound pages.  We only need to avoid handling
them more than once: lock/unlock page only once if it's present in the PMD
range multiple times as it handled on compound level.  The same goes for
LRU isolation and putback.
