phy: cadence: salvo: add salvo phy driver

Cadence SALVO PHY is a 28nm product, and is only used for USB3 & USB2.
According to the Cadence, this PHY is a legacy Module, and Sierra and
Torrent are later evolutions from it, and their sequence overlap is
minimal, meaning we cannot reuse either (Sierra & Torrent) of the PHY
drivers.
