powerpc/watchpoint: Prepare handler to handle more than one watchpoint

Currently we assume that we have only one watchpoint supported by hw.
Get rid of that assumption and use dynamic loop instead. This should
make supporting more watchpoints very easy.

With more than one watchpoint, exception handler needs to know which
DAWR caused the exception, and hw currently does not provide it. So
we need sw logic for the same. To figure out which DAWR caused the
exception, check all different combinations of user specified range,
DAWR address range, actual access range and DAWRX constrains. For ex,
if user specified range and actual access range overlaps but DAWRX is
configured for readonly watchpoint and the instruction is store, this
DAWR must not have caused exception.
