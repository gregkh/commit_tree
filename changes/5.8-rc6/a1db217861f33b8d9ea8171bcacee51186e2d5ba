net: flow_offload: fix flow_indr_dev_unregister path

If the representor is removed, then identify the indirect flow_blocks
that need to be removed by the release callback and the port representor
structure. To identify the port representor structure, a new
indr.cb_priv field needs to be introduced. The flow_block also needs to
be removed from the driver list from the cleanup path.
