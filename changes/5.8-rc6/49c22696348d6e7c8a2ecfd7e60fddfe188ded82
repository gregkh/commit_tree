ASoC: SOF: Update correct LED status at the first time usage of update_mute_led()

At the first time update_mute_led() gets called, if channels are already
muted, the temp value equals to led_value as 0, skipping the following
LED setting.

So set led_value to -1 as an uninitialized state, to update the correct
LED status at first time usage.
