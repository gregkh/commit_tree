arm64/sve: Eliminate data races on sve_default_vl

sve_default_vl can be modified via the /proc/sys/abi/sve_default_vl
sysctl concurrently with use, and modified concurrently by multiple
threads.

Adding a lock for this seems overkill, and I don't want to think any
more than necessary, so just define wrappers using READ_ONCE()/
WRITE_ONCE().

This will avoid the possibility of torn accesses and repeated loads
and stores.

There's no evidence yet that this is going wrong in practice: this
is just hygiene.  For generic sysctl users, it would be better to
build this kind of thing into the sysctl common code somehow.
