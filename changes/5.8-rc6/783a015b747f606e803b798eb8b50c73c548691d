powerpc/rtas: Move type/struct definitions from rtas.h into rtas-types.h

In order to get any rtas* struct into other headers, including rtas.h
may cause a lot of errors, regarding include dependency needed for
inline functions.

Create rtas-types.h and move there all type/struct definitions
from rtas.h, then include rtas-types.h into rtas.h.

Also, as suggested by checkpath.pl, replace uint8_t for u8.
