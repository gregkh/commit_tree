powerpc/32s: Allow mapping with BATs with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

DEBUG_PAGEALLOC only manages RW data.

Text and RO data can still be mapped with BATs.

In order to map with BATs, also enforce data alignment. Set
by default to 256M which is a good compromise for keeping
enough BATs for also KASAN and IMMR.
