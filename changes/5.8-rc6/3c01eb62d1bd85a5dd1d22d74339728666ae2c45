net: ethernet: fec: Allow the MDIO preamble to be disabled

An MDIO transaction normally starts with 32 1s as a preamble. However
not all devices requires such a preamble. Add a device tree property
which allows the preamble to be suppressed. This will half the size of
the MDIO transaction, allowing faster transactions. But it should only
be used when all devices on the bus support suppressed preamble.
