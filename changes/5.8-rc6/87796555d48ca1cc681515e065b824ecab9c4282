KVM: nVMX: Store vmcs.EXIT_QUALIFICATION as an unsigned long, not u32

Use an unsigned long for 'exit_qual' in nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit(), the
EXIT_QUALIFICATION field is naturally sized, not a 32-bit field.

The bug is most easily observed by doing VMXON (or any VMX instruction)
in L2 with a negative displacement, in which case dropping the upper
bits on nested VM-Exit results in L1 calculating the wrong virtual
address for the memory operand, e.g. "vmxon -0x8(%rbp)" yields:

  Unhandled cpu exception 14 #PF at ip 0000000000400553
  rbp=0000000000537000 cr2=0000000100536ff8
