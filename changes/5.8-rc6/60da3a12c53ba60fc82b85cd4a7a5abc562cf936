perf build: Add NO_SDT=1 to the default set of build tests

We forgot to add it, so one would have to explicitely ask for it to be
run, fix that by adding it to the set of tests that are performed by
default when one does:

  $ make -C tools/perf build-test

It was being exercised only in the make_minimal test, this patch makes
it be tested in isolation, i.e. disabling only this feature.
