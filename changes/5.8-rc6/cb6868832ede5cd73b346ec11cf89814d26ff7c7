mm/swap: fix for "mm: workingset: age nonresident information alongside anonymous pages"

Non-file-lru page could also be activated in mark_page_accessed() and we
need to count this activation for nonresident_age.

Note that it's better for this patch to be squashed into the patch "mm:
workingset: age nonresident information alongside anonymous pages".
