ice: Refactor ice_ena_vf_mappings to split MSIX and queue mappings

Currently ice_ena_vf_mappings() does all of the VF's MSIX and queue
mapping in one function. This makes it hard to digest. Fix this by
creating a new function for enabling MSIX mappings and one for enabling
queue mappings.

Also, rename some variables in the functions for clarity.
