exfat: flush dirty metadata in fsync

generic_file_fsync() exfat used could not guarantee the consistency of
a file because it has flushed not dirty metadata but only dirty data pages
for a file.

Instead of that, use exfat_file_fsync() for files and directories so that
it guarantees to commit both the metadata and data pages for a file.
