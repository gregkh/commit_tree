net: mscc: ocelot: lift protocol restriction for flow_match_eth_addrs keys

An attempt was made in commit fe3490e6107e ("net: mscc: ocelot: Hardware
ofload for tc flower filter") to avoid clashes between MAC_ETYPE rules
and IP rules. Because the protocol blacklist should have included
ETH_P_ALL too, it created some confusion, but now the situation should
be dealt with a bit better by the patch immediately previous to this one
("net: mscc: ocelot: refine the ocelot_ace_is_problematic_mac_etype
function").

So now we can remove that check. MAC_ETYPE rules with a protocol of
ETH_P_IP, ETH_P_IPV6, ETH_P_ARP and ETH_P_ALL _are_ supported, with some
restrictions regarding per-port exclusivity which are enforced now.
