kdb: Remove the misfeature 'KDBFLAGS'

Currently, 'KDBFLAGS' is an internal variable of kdb, it is combined
by 'KDBDEBUG' and state flags. It will be shown only when 'KDBDEBUG'
is set, and the user can define an environment variable named 'KDBFLAGS'
too. These are puzzling indeed.

After communication with Daniel, it seems that 'KDBFLAGS' is a misfeature.
So let's replace 'KDBFLAGS' with 'KDBDEBUG' to just show the value we
wrote into. After this modification, we can use `md4c1 kdb_flags` instead,
to observe the state flags.
