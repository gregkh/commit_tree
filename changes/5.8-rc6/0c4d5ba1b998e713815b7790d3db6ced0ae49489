x86/resctrl: Support wider MBM counters

The original Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM) architectural
definition defines counters of up to 62 bits in the
IA32_QM_CTR MSR while the first-generation MBM implementation
uses statically defined 24 bit counters.

The MBM CPUID enumeration properties have been expanded to include
the MBM counter width, encoded as an offset from 24 bits.

While eight bits are available for the counter width offset IA32_QM_CTR
MSR only supports 62 bit counters. Add a sanity check, with warning
printed when encountered, to ensure counters cannot exceed the 62 bit
limit.
