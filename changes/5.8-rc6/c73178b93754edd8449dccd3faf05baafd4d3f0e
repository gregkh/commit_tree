i2c: tegra: Add support for the VI I2C on Tegra210

Tegra210 has an extra instance of the I2C controller that is in the
domain of host1x and usually used for camera use-cases. The programming
model for the VI variant of the controller is roughly the same as for
the other variants, except that the I2C registers start at an offset
and are spaced further apart. VI I2C also doesn't support slave mode.
