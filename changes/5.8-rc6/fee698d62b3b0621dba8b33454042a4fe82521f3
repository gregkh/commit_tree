net: phy: realtek: add delay to resume path of certain internal PHY's

Internal PHY's from RTL8168h up may not be instantly ready after calling
genphy_resume(). So far r8169 network driver adds the needed delay, but
better handle this in the PHY driver. The network driver may miss other
places where the PHY is resumed.
