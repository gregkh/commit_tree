ALSA: firewire-lib: use macro for maximum value of second in 1394 OHCI isoc descriptor

In descriptor of isochronous context in 1394 OHCI, the field of second
has 3 bit, thus the maximum value is 8. The value is used for correct
cycle calculation.

This commit replaces hard-coded value with macro to obsolete magic
number.
