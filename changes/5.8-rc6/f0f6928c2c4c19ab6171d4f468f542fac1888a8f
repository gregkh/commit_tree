kcsan: Move interfaces that affects checks to kcsan-checks.h

This moves functions that affect state changing the behaviour of
kcsan_check_access() to kcsan-checks.h. Since these are likely used with
kcsan_check_access() it makes more sense to have them in kcsan-checks.h,
to avoid including all of 'include/linux/kcsan.h'.

No functional change intended.
