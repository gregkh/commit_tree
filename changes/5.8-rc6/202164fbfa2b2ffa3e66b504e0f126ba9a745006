kgdb: Disable WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED for all kgdb

In commit 81eaadcae81b ("kgdboc: disable the console lock when in
kgdb") we avoided the WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() yell when we were in
kgdboc.  That still works fine, but it turns out that we get a similar
yell when using other I/O drivers.  One example is the "I/O driver"
for the kgdb test suite (kgdbts).  When I enabled that I again got the
same yells.

Even though "kgdbts" doesn't actually interact with the user over the
console, using it still causes kgdb to print to the consoles.  That
trips the same warning:
  con_is_visible+0x60/0x68
  con_scroll+0x110/0x1b8
  lf+0x4c/0xc8
  vt_console_print+0x1b8/0x348
  vkdb_printf+0x320/0x89c
  kdb_printf+0x68/0x90
  kdb_main_loop+0x190/0x860
  kdb_stub+0x2cc/0x3ec
  kgdb_cpu_enter+0x268/0x744
  kgdb_handle_exception+0x1a4/0x200
  kgdb_compiled_brk_fn+0x34/0x44
  brk_handler+0x7c/0xb8
  do_debug_exception+0x1b4/0x228

Let's increment/decrement the "ignore_console_lock_warning" variable
all the time when we enter the debugger.

This will allow us to later revert commit 81eaadcae81b ("kgdboc:
disable the console lock when in kgdb").
