thermal: k3: Add support for bandgap sensors

Add VTM thermal support. In the Voltage Thermal Management
Module(VTM), K3 AM654 supplies a voltage reference and a temperature
sensor feature that are gathered in the band gap voltage and
temperature sensor (VBGAPTS) module. The band gap provides current and
voltage reference for its internal circuits and other analog IP
blocks. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) produces an output value
that is proportional to the silicon temperature.

Currently reading temperatures only is supported.  There are no
active/passive cooling agent supported.
