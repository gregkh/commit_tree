spi: dw: Move Non-DMA code to the DW PCIe-SPI driver

This is a preparation patch before adding the DW DMA support into the
DW SPI MMIO driver. We need to unpin the Non-DMA-specific code from the
intended to be generic DW APB SSI DMA code. This isn't that hard,
since the most part of the spi-dw-mid.c driver in fact implements a
generic DMA interface for the DW SPI controller driver. The only Intel
MID specifics concern getting the max frequency from the MRST Clock
Control Unit and fetching the DMA controller channels from
corresponding PCIe DMA controller. Since first one is related with the
SPI interface configuration we moved it' implementation into the
DW PCIe-SPI driver module. After that former spi-dw-mid.c file
can be just renamed to be the DW SPI DMA module optionally compiled in to
the DW APB SSI core driver.
