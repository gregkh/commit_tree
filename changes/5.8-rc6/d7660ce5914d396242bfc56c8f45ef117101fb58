slub: Remove userspace notifier for cache add/remove

I came across some unnecessary uevents once again which reminded me
this.  The patch seems to be lost in the leaves of the original
discussion [1], so resending.

Kmem caches are internal kernel structures so it is strange that
userspace notifiers would be needed.  And I am not aware of any use of
these notifiers.  These notifiers may just exist because in the initial
slub release the sysfs code was copied from another subsystem.
