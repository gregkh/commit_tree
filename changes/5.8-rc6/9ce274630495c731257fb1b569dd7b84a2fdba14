cpufreq: tegra20: Use generic cpufreq-dt driver (Tegra30 supported now)

Re-parenting to intermediate clock is supported now by the clock driver
and thus there is no need in a customized CPUFreq driver, all that code
is common for both Tegra20 and Tegra30. The available CPU freqs are now
specified in device-tree in a form of OPPs, all users should update their
device-trees.
