KVM: x86/mmu: Add module param to force TLB flush on root reuse

Add a module param, flush_on_reuse, to override skip_tlb_flush and
skip_mmu_sync when performing a so called "fast cr3 switch", i.e. when
reusing a cached root.  The primary motiviation for the control is to
provide a fallback mechanism in the event that TLB flushing and/or MMU
sync bugs are exposed/introduced by upcoming changes to stop
unconditionally flushing on nested VMX transitions.
