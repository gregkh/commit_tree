net: dsa: sja1105: add packing ops for the Retagging Table

The Retagging Table is an optional feature that allows the switch to
match frames against a {ingress port, egress port, vid} rule and change
their VLAN ID. The retagged frames are by default clones of the original
ones (since the hardware-foreseen use case was to mirror traffic for
debugging purposes and to tag it with a special VLAN for this purpose),
but we can force the original frames to be dropped by removing the
pre-retagging VLAN from the port membership list of the egress port.
