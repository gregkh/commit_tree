sparc32: mm: Only call ctor()/dtor() functions for first and last user

The SRMMU page-table allocator allocates multiple PTE tables per page,
since they are only 1K in size. However, this means that calls to
pgtable_pte_page_{ctor,dtor}() must be serialised and performed only by
the first and last page-table allocation for the page respectively.

Use the page reference count to track how many PTE tables we have
allocated for a given page returned by the SRMMU allocator and only
call the ctor()/dtor() functions for the first and last user respectively.
