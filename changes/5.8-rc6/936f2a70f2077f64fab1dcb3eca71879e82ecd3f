cgroup: add cpu.stat file to root cgroup

Currently, the root cgroup does not have a cpu.stat file. Add one which
is consistent with /proc/stat to capture global cpu statistics that
might not fall under cgroup accounting.

We haven't done this in the past because the data are already presented
in /proc/stat and we didn't want to add overhead from collecting root
cgroup stats when cgroups are configured, but no cgroups have been
created.

By keeping the data consistent with /proc/stat, I think we avoid the
first problem, while improving the usability of cgroups stats.
We avoid the second problem by computing the contents of cpu.stat from
existing data collected for /proc/stat anyway.
