fscrypt: fix all kerneldoc warnings

Fix all kerneldoc warnings in fs/crypto/ and include/linux/fscrypt.h.
Most of these were due to missing documentation for function parameters.

Detected with:

    scripts/kernel-doc -v -none fs/crypto/*.{c,h} include/linux/fscrypt.h

This cleanup makes it possible to check new patches for kerneldoc
warnings without having to filter out all the existing ones.

For consistency, also adjust some function "brief descriptions" to
include the parentheses and to wrap at 80 characters.  (The latter
matches the checkpatch expectation.)
