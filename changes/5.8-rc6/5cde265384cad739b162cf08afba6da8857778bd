perf/x86/rapl: Add AMD Fam17h RAPL support

This patch enables AMD Fam17h RAPL support for the Package level metric.
The support is as per AMD Fam17h Model31h (Zen2) and model 00-ffh (Zen1) PPR.

The same output is available via the energy-pkg pseudo event:

  $ perf stat -a -I 1000 --per-socket -e power/energy-pkg/
