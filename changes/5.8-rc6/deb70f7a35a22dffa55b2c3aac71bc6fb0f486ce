powerpc/pseries/ras: Fix FWNMI_VALID off by one

This was discovered developing qemu fwnmi sreset support. This
off-by-one bug means the last 16 bytes of the rtas area can not
be used for a 16 byte save area.

It's not a serious bug, and QEMU implementation has to retain a
workaround for old kernels, but it's good to tighten it.
