Bluetooth: L2CAP: add support for waiting disconnection resp

Whenever we disconnect a L2CAP connection, we would immediately
report a disconnection event (EPOLLHUP) to the upper layer, without
waiting for the response of the other device.

This patch offers an option to wait until we receive a disconnection
response before reporting disconnection event, by using the "how"
parameter in l2cap_sock_shutdown(). Therefore, upper layer can opt
to wait for disconnection response by shutdown(sock, SHUT_WR).

This can be used to enforce proper disconnection order in HID,
where the disconnection of the interrupt channel must be complete
before attempting to disconnect the control channel.
