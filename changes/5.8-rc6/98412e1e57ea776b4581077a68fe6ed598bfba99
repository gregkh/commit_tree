dt-bindings: Add binding for Hardkernel Odroid Go Advance

Add a compatible for the Odroid Go Advance from Hardkernel.
The compatible used by the vendor already is odroid-go2, to distinguish
it from the previous (microcontroller-based) Odroid Go, so we're keeping
that, also to not cause unnecessary incompatibilites.
