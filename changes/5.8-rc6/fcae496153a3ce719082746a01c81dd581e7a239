drm/i915: Prevent using semaphores to chain up to external fences

The downside of using semaphores is that we lose metadata passing
along the signaling chain. This is particularly nasty when we
need to pass along a fatal error such as EFAULT or EDEADLK. For
fatal errors we want to scrub the request before it is executed,
which means that we cannot preload the request onto HW and have
it wait upon a semaphore.
