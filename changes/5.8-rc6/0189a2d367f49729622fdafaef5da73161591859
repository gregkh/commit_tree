fuse: use ->reconfigure() instead of ->remount_fs()

s_op->remount_fs() is only called from legacy_reconfigure(), which is not
used after being converted to the new API.

Convert to using ->reconfigure().  This restores the previous behavior of
syncing the filesystem and rejecting MS_MANDLOCK on remount.
