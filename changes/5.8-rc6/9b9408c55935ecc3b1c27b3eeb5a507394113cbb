powerpc/powernv/pci: Register iommu group at PE DMA setup

Move the registration of IOMMU groups out of the post-phb init fixup and
into when we configure DMA for a PE. For most devices this doesn't
result in any functional changes, but for NVLink attached GPUs it
requires a bit of care. When the GPU is probed an IOMMU group would be
created for the PE that contains it. We need to ensure that group is
removed before we add the PE to the compound group that's used to keep
the translations see by the PCIe and NVLink buses the same.

No functional changes. Probably.
