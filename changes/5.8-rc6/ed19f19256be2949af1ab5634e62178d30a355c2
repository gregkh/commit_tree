zram: Allocate struct zcomp_strm as per-CPU memory

zcomp::stream is a per-CPU pointer, pointing to struct zcomp_strm
which contains two pointers. Having struct zcomp_strm allocated
directly as per-CPU memory would avoid one additional memory
allocation and a pointer dereference. This also simplifies the
addition of a local_lock to struct zcomp_strm.

Allocate zcomp::stream directly as per-CPU memory.
