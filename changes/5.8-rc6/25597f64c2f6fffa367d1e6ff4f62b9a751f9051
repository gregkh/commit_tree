Revert "KVM: x86: work around leak of uninitialized stack contents"

handle_vmptrst()/handle_vmread() stopped injecting #PF unconditionally
and switched to nested_vmx_handle_memory_failure() which just kills the
guest with KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR in case of MMIO access, zeroing
'exception' in kvm_write_guest_virt_system() is not needed anymore.

This reverts commit 541ab2aeb28251bf7135c7961f3a6080eebcc705.
