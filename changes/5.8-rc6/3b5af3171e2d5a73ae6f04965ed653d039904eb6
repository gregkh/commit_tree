media: cec: silence shift wrapping warning in __cec_s_log_addrs()

The log_addrs->log_addr_type[i] value is a u8 which is controlled by
the user and comes from the ioctl.  If it's over 31 then that results in
undefined behavior (shift wrapping) and that leads to a Smatch static
checker warning.  We already cap the value later so we can silence the
warning just by re-ordering the existing checks.

I think the UBSan checker will also catch this bug at runtime and
generate a warning.  But otherwise the bug is harmless.
