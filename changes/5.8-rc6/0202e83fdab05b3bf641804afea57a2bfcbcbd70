btrfs: simplify iget helpers

The inode lookup starting at btrfs_iget takes the full location key,
while only the objectid is used to match the inode, because the lookup
happens inside the given root thus the inode number is unique.
The entire location key is properly set up in btrfs_init_locked_inode.

Simplify the helpers and pass only inode number, renaming it to 'ino'
instead of 'objectid'. This allows to remove temporary variables key,
saving some stack space.
