net: Replace the limit of TCP_LINGER2 with TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT_MAX

This patch changes the behavior of TCP_LINGER2 about its limit. The
sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout used to be the limit of TCP_LINGER2 but now it's
only the default value. A new macro named TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT_MAX is added
as the limit of TCP_LINGER2, which is 2 minutes.

Since TCP_LINGER2 used sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout as the default value
and the limit in the past, the system administrator cannot set the
default value for most of sockets and let some sockets have a greater
timeout. It might be a mistake that let the sysctl to be the limit of
the TCP_LINGER2. Maybe we can add a new sysctl to set the max of
TCP_LINGER2, but FIN-WAIT-2 timeout is usually no need to be too long
and 2 minutes are legal considering TCP specs.

Changes in v3:
- Remove the new socket option and change the TCP_LINGER2 behavior so
  that the timeout can be set to value between sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout
  and 2 minutes.

Changes in v2:
- Add int overflow check for the new socket option.

Changes in v1:
- Add a new socket option to set timeout greater than
  sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout.
