ath10k: enable alt data of TX path for sdio

The default credit size is 1792 bytes, but the IP mtu is 1500 bytes,
then it has about 290 bytes's waste for each data packet on sdio
transfer path for TX bundle, it will reduce the transmission utilization
ratio for data packet.

This patch enable the small credit size in firmware, firmware will use
the new credit size 1556 bytes, it will increase the transmission
utilization ratio for data packet on TX patch. It results in significant
performance improvement on TX path.

This patch only effect sdio chip, it will not effect PCI, SNOC etc.

Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware
WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00017-QCARMSWP-1.
