Documentation: SoundWire: clarify TDM mode support

The current description of stream topologies does not explicitly
mention 'mirror' topologies used for audio amplifiers, where all
amplifiers see the same data and generate a different output based on
configuration or dynamic information. Add examples and notes to
explain how channels can be transmitted and mapped.
