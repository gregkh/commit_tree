tracing/probe: reverse arguments to list_add

Elsewhere in the file, the function trace_kprobe_has_same_kprobe uses
a trace_probe_event.probes object as the second argument of
list_for_each_entry, ie as a list head, while the list_for_each_entry
iterates over the list fields of the trace_probe structures, making
them the list elements.  So, exchange the arguments on the list_add
call to put the list head in the second argument.

Since both list_head structures were just initialized, this problem
did not cause any loss of information.
