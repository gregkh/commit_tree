handle the group_source_req options directly

Native ->setsockopt() handling of these options (MCAST_..._SOURCE_GROUP
and MCAST_{,UN}BLOCK_SOURCE) consists of copyin + call of a helper that
does the actual work.  The only change needed for ->compat_setsockopt()
is a slightly different copyin - the helpers can be reused as-is.
