x86/entry/xen: Route #DB correctly on Xen PV

On Xen PV, #DB doesn't use IST. It still needs to be correctly routed
depending on whether it came from user or kernel mode.

Get rid of DECLARE/DEFINE_IDTENTRY_XEN -- it was too hard to follow the
logic.  Instead, route #DB and NMI through DECLARE/DEFINE_IDTENTRY_RAW on
Xen, and do the right thing for #DB.  Also add more warnings to the
exc_debug* handlers to make this type of failure more obvious.

This fixes various forms of corruption that happen when usermode
triggers #DB on Xen PV.
