pipe: Allow buffers to be marked read-whole-or-error for notifications

Allow a buffer to be marked such that read() must return the entire buffer
in one go or return ENOBUFS.  Multiple buffers can be amalgamated into a
single read, but a short read will occur if the next "whole" buffer won't
fit.

This is useful for watch queue notifications to make sure we don't split a
notification across multiple reads, especially given that we need to
fabricate an overrun record under some circumstances - and that isn't in
the buffers.
