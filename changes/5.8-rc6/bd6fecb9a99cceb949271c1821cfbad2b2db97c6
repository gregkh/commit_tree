selftests/bpf: Add cgroup_skb/egress test for load_bytes_relative

When cgroup_skb/egress triggers the MAC header is not set. Added a
test that asserts reading MAC header is a -EFAULT but NET header
succeeds. The test result from within the eBPF program is stored in
an 1-element array map that the userspace then reads and asserts on.

Another assertion is added that reading from a large offset, past
the end of packet, returns -EFAULT.
