serial: qcom_geni_serial: Support kgdboc_earlycon

Implement the read() function in the early console driver.  With
recent kgdb patches this allows you to use kgdb to debug fairly early
into the system boot.

We only bother implementing this if polling is enabled since kgdb
can't be enabled without that.
