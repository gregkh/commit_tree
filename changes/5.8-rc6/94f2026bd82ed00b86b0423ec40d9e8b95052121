drm/amdgpu/smu10: Replace one-element array and use struct_size() helper

The current codebase makes use of one-element arrays in the following
form:

struct something {
    int length;
    u8 data[1];
};

struct something *instance;

instance = kmalloc(sizeof(*instance) + size, GFP_KERNEL);
instance->length = size;
memcpy(instance->data, source, size);

but the preferred mechanism to declare variable-length types such as
these ones is a flexible array member[1][2], introduced in C99:

struct foo {
        int stuff;
        struct boo array[];
};

By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
in case the flexible array does not occur last in the structure, which
will help us prevent some kind of undefined behavior bugs from being
inadvertently introduced[3] to the codebase from now on. So, replace
the one-element array with a flexible-array member.

Also, make use of the new struct_size() helper to properly calculate the
size of struct smu10_voltage_dependency_table.

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and fixed
_manually_.
