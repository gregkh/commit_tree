iio:humidity:hts221 Fix alignment and data leak issues

One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
this driver which uses an array of smaller elements on the stack.
As Lars also noted this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to
userspace and that indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by
moving to a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data.
This data is allocated with kzalloc so no data can leak
apart from previous readings.

Explicit alignment of ts needed to ensure consistent padding
on all architectures (particularly x86_32 with it's 4 byte alignment
of s64)
