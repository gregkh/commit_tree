phy: phy-brcm-usb: Constify static structs

A number of structs were not modified and can therefore be made const
to allow the compiler to put them in read-only memory.

In order to do so, update a few functions that don't modify there input
to take pointers to const.

Before:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  15511    6448      64   22023    5607 drivers/phy/broadcom/phy-brcm-usb.o

After:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
