RDMA/uverbs: Make the event_queue fds return POLLERR when disassociated

If is_closed is set, and the event list is empty, then read() will return
-EIO without blocking. After setting is_closed in
ib_uverbs_free_event_queue(), we do trigger a wake_up on the poll_wait,
but the fops->poll() function does not check it, so poll will continue to
sleep on an empty list.
