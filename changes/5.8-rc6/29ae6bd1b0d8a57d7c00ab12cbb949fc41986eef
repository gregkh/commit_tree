net: ethernet: fec: Replace interrupt driven MDIO with polled IO

Measurements of the MDIO bus have shown that driving the MDIO bus
using interrupts is slow. Back to back MDIO transactions take about
90us, with 25us spent performing the transaction, and the remainder of
the time the bus is idle.

Replacing the completion interrupt with polled IO results in back to
back transactions of 40us. The polling loop waiting for the hardware
to complete the transaction takes around 28us. Which suggests
interrupt handling has an overhead of 50us, and polled IO nearly
halves this overhead, and doubles the MDIO performance.
