KVM: x86: WARN on injected+pending exception even in nested case

WARN if a pending exception is coincident with an injected exception
before calling check_nested_events() so that the WARN will fire even if
inject_pending_event() bails early because check_nested_events() detects
the conflict.  Bailing early isn't problematic (quite the opposite), but
suppressing the WARN is undesirable as it could mask a bug elsewhere in
KVM.
