mac80211: allow SA-QUERY processing in userspace

As discussed with Mathy almost two years ago in
http://lore.kernel.org/r/20180806224857.14853-1-Mathy.Vanhoef@cs.kuleuven.be
we should let userspace process SA-QUERY frames if it
wants to, so that it can handle OCV (operating channel
validation) which mac80211 doesn't know how to.

Evidently I had been expecting Mathy to (re)send such a
patch, but he never did, perhaps expecting me to do it
after our discussion.

In any case, this came up now with OCV getting more
attention, so move the code around as discussed there
to let userspace handle it, and do it properly.
