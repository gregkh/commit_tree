Drivers: hv: allocate the exact needed memory for messages

When we need to pass a buffer with Hyper-V message we don't need to always
allocate 256 bytes for the message: the real message length is known from
the header. Change 'struct onmessage_work_context' to make it possible to
not over-allocate.
