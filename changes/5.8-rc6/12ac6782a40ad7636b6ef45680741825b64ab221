sched/swait: Reword some of the main description

With both the increased use of swait and kvm no longer using
it, we can reword some of the comments. While removing Linus'
valid rant, I've also cared to explicitly mention that swait
is very different than regular wait. In addition it is
mentioned against using swait in favor of the regular flavor.
