net: add sock_set_reuseaddr

Add a helper to directly set the SO_REUSEADDR sockopt from kernel space
without going through a fake uaccess.

For this the iscsi target now has to formally depend on inet to avoid
a mostly theoretical compile failure.  For actual operation it already
did depend on having ipv4 or ipv6 support.
