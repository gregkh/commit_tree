atomisp: avoid warning about unused function

The atomisp_mrfld_power() function isn't actually ever called, because
the two call-sites have commented out the use because it breaks on some
platforms.  That results in:

  drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp_v4l2.c:764:12: warning: ‘atomisp_mrfld_power’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
    764 | static int atomisp_mrfld_power(struct atomisp_device *isp, bool enable)
        |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

during the build.

Rather than commenting out the use entirely, just disable it
semantically instead (using a "0 &&" construct), leaving the call in
place from a syntax standpoint, and avoiding the warning.

I really don't want my builds to have any warnings that can then hide
real issues.
