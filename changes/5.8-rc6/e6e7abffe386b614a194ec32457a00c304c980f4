blk-mq: simplify the blk_mq_get_request calling convention

The bio argument is entirely unused, and the request_queue can be passed
through the alloc_data, given that it needs to be filled out for the
low-level tag allocation anyway.  Also rename the function to
__blk_mq_alloc_request as the switch between get and alloc in the call
chains is rather confusing.
