zonefs: use REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND for sync DIO

Synchronous direct I/O to a sequential write only zone can be issued using
the new REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND request operation. As dispatching multiple
BIOs can potentially result in reordering, we cannot support asynchronous
IO via this interface.

We also can only dispatch up to queue_max_zone_append_sectors() via the
new zone-append method and have to return a short write back to user-space
in case an IO larger than queue_max_zone_append_sectors() has been issued.
