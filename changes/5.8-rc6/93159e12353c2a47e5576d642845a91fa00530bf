drm/i915/gem: Avoid gem_context->mutex for simple vma lookup

As we store the handle lookup inside a radix tree, we do not need the
gem_context->mutex except until we need to insert our lookup into the
common radix tree. This takes a small bit of rearranging to ensure that
the lut we insert into the tree is ready prior to actually inserting it
(as soon as it is exposed via the radixtree, it is visible to any other
submission).

v2: For brownie points, remove the goto spaghetti.
v3: Tighten up the closed-handle checks.
