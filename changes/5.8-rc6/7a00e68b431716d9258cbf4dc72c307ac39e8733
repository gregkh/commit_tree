drm/i915/psr: Use new DP VSC SDP compute routine on PSR

In order to use a common VSC SDP Colorimetry calculating code on PSR,
it uses a new psr vsc sdp compute routine.
Because PSR routine has its own scenario and timings of writing a VSC SDP,
the current PSR routine needs to have its own drm_dp_vsc_sdp structure
member variable on struct i915_psr.

In order to calculate colorimetry information, intel_psr_update()
function and intel_psr_enable() function extend a drm_connector_state
argument.

There are no changes to PSR mechanism.

v3: Replace a structure name to drm_dp_vsc_sdp from intel_dp_vsc_sdp
v4: Rebased
v8: Rebased
v10: When a PSR is enabled, it needs to add DP_SDP_VSC to
     infoframes.enable.
     It is needed for comparing between HW and pipe_state of VSC_SDP.
v11: If PSR is disabled by flag, it don't enable psr on pipe compute.
v12: Fix an inconsistent indenting
