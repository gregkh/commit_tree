batman-adv: use rcu_replace_pointer() where appropriate

In commit a63fc6b75cca ("rcu: Upgrade rcu_swap_protected() to
rcu_replace_pointer()") a new helper macro named rcu_replace_pointer() was
introduced to simplify code requiring to switch an rcu pointer to a new
value while extracting the old one.

Use rcu_replace_pointer() where appropriate to make code slimer.
