mmc: host: Prepare host drivers for mmc_regulator_set_vqmmc() returning > 0

Patch all drivers which use mmc_regulator_set_vqmmc() and prepare them for
the fact that mmc_regulator_set_vqmmc() can return a value > 0, which would
happen if the signal voltage switch did NOT happen, because the voltage was
already set correctly.
