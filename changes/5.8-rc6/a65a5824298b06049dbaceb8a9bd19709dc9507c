iwlwifi: avoid debug max amsdu config overwriting itself

If we set amsdu_len one after another the second one overwrites
the orig_amsdu_len so allow only moving from debug to non debug state.

Also the TLC update check was wrong: it was checking that also the orig
is smaller then the new updated size, which is not the case in debug
amsdu mode.
