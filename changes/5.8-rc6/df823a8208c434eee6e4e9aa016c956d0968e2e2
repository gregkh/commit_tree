media: cec: rename CEC platform drivers config options

Most CEC platform drivers are using VIDEO_*_CEC pattern, some with
an _HDMI extension too.

Well, they're not related to V4L2 support, and we don't really
need those big config names. So drop VIDEO_* from them, remove
_HDMI (if present) and move CEC to the start.

This way, all platform driver options are now CEC_<driver>.
