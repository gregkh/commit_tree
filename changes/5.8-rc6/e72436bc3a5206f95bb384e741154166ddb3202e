KVM: SVM: avoid infinite loop on NPF from bad address

When a nested page fault is taken from an address that does not have
a memslot associated to it, kvm_mmu_do_page_fault returns RET_PF_EMULATE
(via mmu_set_spte) and kvm_mmu_page_fault then invokes svm_need_emulation_on_page_fault.

The default answer there is to return false, but in this case this just
causes the page fault to be retried ad libitum.  Since this is not a
fast path, and the only other case where it is taken is an erratum,
just stick a kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_memslot check in there to detect the
common case where the erratum is not happening.

This fixes an infinite loop in the new set_memory_region_test.
