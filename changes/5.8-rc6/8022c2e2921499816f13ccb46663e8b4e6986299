media: atomisp: get rid of ia_css_sc_param.h version dependency

That's the last header file which had ifdefs for ISP2401.

The problem is that the conflicting dependencies were on another
file (sh_css_defs.h). Move the conflicting code to it, adding
a prefix which would describe what version the macro applies.

Then, ensure that binary.c will use the right version,
according with the hardware version.
