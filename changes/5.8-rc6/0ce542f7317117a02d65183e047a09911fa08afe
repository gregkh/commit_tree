drm/i915: Don't clear drvdata in ->release

For two reasons:

- The driver core clears this already for us after we're unloaded in
  __device_release_driver().

- It's way too late, the drm_device ->release callback might massively
  outlive the underlying physical device, since a drm_device can be
  kept alive by open drm_file or well really anything else userspace
  is still hanging onto. So if we clear this ourselves, we should
  clear it in the pci ->remove callback, not in the drm_device
  ->release callback.

Looking at git history this was fixed in the driver core with
