powerpc/papr_scm: Fetch nvdimm health information from PHYP

Implement support for fetching nvdimm health information via
H_SCM_HEALTH hcall as documented in Ref[1]. The hcall returns a pair
of 64-bit bitmap, bitwise-and of which is then stored in
'struct papr_scm_priv' and subsequently partially exposed to
user-space via newly introduced dimm specific attribute
'papr/flags'. Since the hcall is costly, the health information is
cached and only re-queried, 60s after the previous successful hcall.

The patch also adds a  documentation text describing flags reported by
the the new sysfs attribute 'papr/flags' is also introduced at
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-papr-pmem.
