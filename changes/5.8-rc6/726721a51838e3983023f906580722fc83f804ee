tracing: Move synthetic events to a separate file

With the addition of the in-kernel synthetic event API, synthetic
events are no longer specifically tied to the histogram triggers.

The synthetic event code is also making trace_event_hist.c very
bloated, so for those reasons, move it to a separate file,
trace_events_synth.c, along with a new trace_synth.h header file.

Because synthetic events are now independent from hist triggers, add a
new CONFIG_SYNTH_EVENTS config option, and have CONFIG_HIST_TRIGGERS
select it, and have CONFIG_SYNTH_EVENT_GEN_TEST depend on it.
