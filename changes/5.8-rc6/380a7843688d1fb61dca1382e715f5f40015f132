usb: chipidea: usbmisc_imx: using different ops for imx7d and imx7ulp

imx7ulp uses different USB PHY with imx7d (MXS PHY vs PICO PHY), so the
features are supported by non-core register are a little different.
For example, autoresume feature is supported by all controllers for
imx7ulp, but for imx7d, it is only supported by non-HSIC controller.

Besides, these two platforms use different HSIC controller, imx7ulp
needs software operation, but imx7d doesn't.
