KVM: nVMX: Add helper to handle TLB flushes on nested VM-Enter/VM-Exit

Add a helper to determine whether or not a full TLB flush needs to be
performed on nested VM-Enter/VM-Exit, as the logic is identical for both
flows and needs a fairly beefy comment to boot.  This also provides a
common point to make future adjustments to the logic.

Handle vpid12 changes the new helper as well even though it is specific
to VM-Enter.  The vpid12 logic is an extension of the flushing logic,
and it's worth the extra bool parameter to provide a single location for
the flushing logic.
