bpf: Fix unused-var without NETDEVICES

A recent commit added new variables only used if CONFIG_NETDEVICES is
set. A simple fix would be to only declare these variables if the same
condition is valid but Alexei suggested an even simpler solution:

    since CONFIG_NETDEVICES doesn't change anything in .h I think the
    best is to remove #ifdef CONFIG_NETDEVICES from net/core/filter.c
    and rely on sock_bindtoindex() returning ENOPROTOOPT in the extreme
    case of oddly configured kernels.
