drm/i915/gt: Prefer soft-rc6 over RPS DOWN_TIMEOUT

The RPS DOWN_TIMEOUT interrupt is signaled after a period of rc6, and
upon receipt of that interrupt we reprogram the GPU clocks down to the
next idle notch [to help convserve power during rc6]. However, on
execlists, we benefit from soft-rc6 immediately parking the GPU and
setting idle frequencies upon idling [within a jiffie], and here the
interrupt prevents us from restarting from our last frequency.

In the process, we can simply opt for a static pm_events mask and rely
on the enable/disable interrupts to flush the worker on parking.

This will reduce the amount of oscillation observed during steady
workloads with microsleeps, as each time the rc6 timeout occurs we
immediately follow with a waitboost for a dropped frame.
