powerpc: Add prefixed instructions to instruction data type

For powerpc64, redefine the ppc_inst type so both word and prefixed
instructions can be represented. On powerpc32 the type will remain the
same. Update places which had assumed instructions to be 4 bytes long.

[mpe: Rework the get_user_inst() macros to be parameterised, and don't
      assign to the dest if an error occurred. Use CONFIG_PPC64 not
      __powerpc64__ in a few places. Address other comments from
      Christophe. Fix some sparse complaints.]
