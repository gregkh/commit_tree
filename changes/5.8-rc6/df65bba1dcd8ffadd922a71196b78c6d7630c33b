lib/bsearch: Provide __always_inline variant

For code that needs the ultimate performance (it can inline the @cmp
function too) or simply needs to avoid calling external functions for
whatever reason, provide an __always_inline variant of bsearch().

[ tglx: Renamed to __inline_bsearch() as suggested by Andy ]
