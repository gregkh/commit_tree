platform/x86: intel-hid: Add a quirk to support HP Spectre X2 (2015)

HEBC method reports capabilities of 5 button array but HP Spectre X2 (2015)
does not have this control method (the same was for Wacom MobileStudio Pro).
Expand previous DMI quirk by Alex Hung to also enable 5 button array
for this system.
