net/mlx5: Dedicate fw page to the requesting function

The cited patch assumes that all chuncks in a fw page belong to the same
function, thus the driver must dedicate fw page to the requesting
function, which is actually what was intedned in the original fw pages
allocator design, hence the fwp->func_id !

Up until the cited patch everything worked ok, but now "relase all pages"
is broken on systems with page_size > 4k.

Fix this by dedicating fw page to the requesting function id via adding a
func_id parameter to alloc_4k() function.
