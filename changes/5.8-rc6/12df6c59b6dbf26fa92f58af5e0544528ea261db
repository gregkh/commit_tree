drm/i915/gt: allow setting generic data pointer

When registering debugfs files the intel gt debugfs library
forces a 'struct *gt' private data on the caller.

To be open to different usages make the new
"intel_gt_debugfs_register_files()"[*] function more generic by
converting the 'struct *gt' pointer to a 'void *' type.

I take the chance to rename the functions by using "intel_gt_" as
prefix instead of "debugfs_", so that "debugfs_gt_register_files()"
becomes "intel_gt_debugfs_register_files()".
