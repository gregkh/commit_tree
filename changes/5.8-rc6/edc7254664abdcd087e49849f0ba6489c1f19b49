pinctrl: ocelot: Remove instance number from pin functions

This patch removes the instance number from the "miim", "reco_clk" and
"sfp" pin function.

The change needed is to prepare the driver for adding new platforms
with more of these instances. The instance number is also redundant,
as this is implicit for each pin.
