driver core: fw_devlink: Add support for batching fwnode parsing

The amount of time spent parsing fwnodes of devices can become really
high if the devices are added in an non-ideal order. Worst case can be
O(N^2) when N devices are added. But this can be optimized to O(N) by
adding all the devices and then parsing all their fwnodes in one batch.

This commit adds fw_devlink_pause() and fw_devlink_resume() to allow
doing this.
