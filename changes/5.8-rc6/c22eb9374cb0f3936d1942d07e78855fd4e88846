sierra-ms: do not call scsi_get_host_dev()

scsi_get_host_dev() will create a virtual device such that either
the target id is ignored from scanning (if 'this_id' is set to
something which can be reached during scanning) or if the driver
needs a scsi device for the HBA to send commands to.
Neither is true for sierra-ms; 'this_id' remains at the default
value '-1' and the created device is never ever used within
the driver.
So kill it.
