mwifiex: avoid -Wstringop-overflow warning

gcc-10 reports a warning for mwifiex_cmd_802_11_key_material_v1:

drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/sta_cmd.c: In function 'mwifiex_cmd_802_11_key_material_v1':
cc1: warning: writing 16 bytes into a region of size 0 [-Wstringop-overflow=]
In file included from drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/sta_cmd.c:23:
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/fw.h:993:9: note: at offset 0 to object 'action' with size 2 declared here
  993 |  __le16 action;
      |         ^~~~~~

As the warning makes no sense, I reported it as a bug for gcc. In the
meantime using a temporary pointer for the key data makes the code easier
to read and stops the warning.
