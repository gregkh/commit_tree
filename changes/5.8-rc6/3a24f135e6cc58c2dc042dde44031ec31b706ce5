ASoC: intel/skl/hda - set autosuspend timeout for hda codecs

On some Lenovo and HP laptops, if both codec driver and SOF driver
are in runtime suspend mode, we plug a headset to the audio jack,
the headphone could be detected but Mic couldn't.

That is because when plugging, the headphone triggers a unsol event
first, and about 0.7s later (on the Lenovo X1 Carbon 7th), the Mic
triggers a unsol event. But if the codec driver enters runtime suspend
within 0.7s, the Mic can't trigger the unsol event.

If we don't set autosuspend_delay to a non-zero value for the hda codec
driver, it will enter runtime suspend immediately after the headphone
triggers the unsol event.

Follow the sequence of legacy hda driver and set a autosuspend delay
of 1sec after card registration (refer to pci/hda/hda_intel.c and
pci/hda/hda_codec.c).
