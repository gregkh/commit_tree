drm/i915/gt: Move hsw GT workarounds from init_clock_gating to workarounds

Rescue the GT workarounds from being buried inside init_clock_gating so
that we remember to apply them after a GT reset, and that they are
included in our verification that the workarounds are applied.

v2: Leave HSW_SCRATCH to set an explicit value, not or in our disable
bit.
