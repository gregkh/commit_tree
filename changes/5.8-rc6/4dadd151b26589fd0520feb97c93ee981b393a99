net/smc: enqueue local LLC messages

As SMC server, when a second link was deleted, trigger the setup of an
asymmetric link. Do this by enqueueing a local ADD_LINK message which
is processed by the LLC layer as if it were received from peer. Do the
same when a new IB port became active and a new link could be created.
smc_llc_srv_add_link_local() enqueues a local ADD_LINK message.
And smc_llc_srv_delete_link_local() is used the same way to enqueue a
local DELETE_LINK message. This is used when an IB port is no longer
active.
