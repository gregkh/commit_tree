habanalabs: add gaudi security module

Add the code to initialize the security module of GAUDI. Similar to Goya,
we have two dedicated mechanisms for security: Range Registers and
Protection bits. Those mechanisms protect sensitive memory and
configuration areas inside the device.

In addition, in Gaudi we moved to a 3-level security scheme, where the F/W
runs with the highest security level (Privileged), the driver runs with a
less secured level (Secured) and the user is neither privileged nor
secured. The security module in the driver configures the Secured parts so
the user won't be able to access them. The Privileged parts are configured
by the F/W.
