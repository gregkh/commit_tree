s390/vdso: fix vDSO clock_getres()

clock_getres in the vDSO library has to preserve the same behaviour
of posix_get_hrtimer_res().

In particular, posix_get_hrtimer_res() does:
    sec = 0;
    ns = hrtimer_resolution;
and hrtimer_resolution depends on the enablement of the high
resolution timers that can happen either at compile or at run time.

Fix the s390 vdso implementation of clock_getres keeping a copy of
hrtimer_resolution in vdso data and using that directly.
