drivers/perf: Prevent forced unbinding of PMU drivers

Forcefully unbinding PMU drivers during perf sampling will lead to
a kernel panic, because the perf upper-layer framework call a NULL
pointer in this situation.

To solve this issue, "suppress_bind_attrs" should be set to true, so
that bind/unbind can be disabled via sysfs and prevent unbinding PMU
drivers during perf sampling.
