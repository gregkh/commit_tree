IB/hfi1: Correct -EBUSY handling in tx code

The current code mishandles -EBUSY in two ways:
- The flow change doesn't test the return from the flush and runs on to
  process the current packet racing with the wakeup processing
- The -EBUSY handling for a single packet inserts the tx into the txlist
  after the submit call, racing with the same wakeup processing

Fix the first by dropping the skb and returning NETDEV_TX_OK.

Fix the second by insuring the the list entry within the txreq is inited
when allocated.  This enables the sleep routine to detect that the txreq
has used the non-list api and queue the packet to the txlist.

Both flaws can lead to having the flushing thread executing in causing two
threads to manipulate the txlist.
