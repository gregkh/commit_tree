audit: fix a net reference leak in audit_list_rules_send()

If audit_list_rules_send() fails when trying to create a new thread
to send the rules it also fails to cleanup properly, leaking a
reference to a net structure.  This patch fixes the error patch and
renames audit_send_list() to audit_send_list_thread() to better
match its cousin, audit_send_reply_thread().
