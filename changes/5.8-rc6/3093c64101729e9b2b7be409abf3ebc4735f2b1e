i2c: mux: pca954x: Move device_remove_file() out of pca954x_cleanup()

device_create_file() is called the last in ->probe() but pca954x_cleanup(),
which is called earlier in error path, tries to remove never created file.
Move device_remove_file() call outside of pca954x_cleanup() to make it
slightly closer to what pca954x_init() is doing.
