btrfs: don't do repair validation for checksum errors

The purpose of the validation step is to distinguish between good and
bad sectors in a failed multi-sector read. If a multi-sector read
succeeded but some of those sectors had checksum errors, we don't need
to validate anything; we know the sectors with bad checksums need to be
repaired.
