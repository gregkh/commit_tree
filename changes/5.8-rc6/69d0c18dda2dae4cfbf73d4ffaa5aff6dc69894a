drm/amdgpu: Disable FRU read on Arcturus

Update the list with supported Arcturus chips, but disable for now until
final list is confirmed.

Ideally we can poll atombios for FRU support, instead of maintaining
this list of chips, but this will enable serial number reading for
supported ASICs for the time-being.
