ELF: Add ELF program property parsing support

ELF program properties will be needed for detecting whether to
enable optional architecture or ABI features for a new ELF process.

For now, there are no generic properties that we care about, so do
nothing unless CONFIG_ARCH_USE_GNU_PROPERTY=y.

Otherwise, the presence of properties using the PT_PROGRAM_PROPERTY
phdrs entry (if any), and notify each property to the arch code.

For now, the added code is not used.
