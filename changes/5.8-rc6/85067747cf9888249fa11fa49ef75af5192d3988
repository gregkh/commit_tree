dm: do not use waitqueue for request-based DM

Given request-based DM now uses blk-mq's blk_mq_queue_inflight() to
determine if outstanding IO has completed (and DM has no control over
the blk-mq state machine used to track outstanding IO) it is unsafe to
wakeup waiter (dm_wait_for_completion) before blk-mq has cleared a
request's state bits (e.g. MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT or MQ_RQ_COMPLETE).  As
such dm_wait_for_completion() could be left to wait indefinitely if no
other requests complete.

Fix this by eliminating request-based DM's use of waitqueue to wait
for blk-mq requests to complete in dm_wait_for_completion.
