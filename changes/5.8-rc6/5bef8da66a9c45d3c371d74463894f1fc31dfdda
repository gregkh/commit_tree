rcu: Add per-task state to RCU CPU stall warnings

Currently, an RCU-preempt CPU stall warning simply lists the PIDs of
those tasks holding up the current grace period.  This can be helpful,
but more can be even more helpful.

To this end, this commit adds the nesting level, whether the task
thinks it was preempted in its current RCU read-side critical section,
whether RCU core has asked this task for a quiescent state, whether the
expedited-grace-period hint is set, and whether the task believes that
it is on the blocked-tasks list (it must be, or it would not be printed,
but if things are broken, best not to take too much for granted).
