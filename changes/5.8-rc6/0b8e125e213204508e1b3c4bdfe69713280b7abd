RDMA/core: Fix several reference count leaks.

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.  If this
function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to properly clean
up the memory associated with the object. Previous
commit b8eb718348b8 ("net-sysfs: Fix reference count leak in
rx|netdev_queue_add_kobject") fixed a similar problem.
