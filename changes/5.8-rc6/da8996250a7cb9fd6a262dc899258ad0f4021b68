dm ioctl: use struct_size() helper in retrieve_deps()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct dm_target_deps {
      ...
        __u64 dev[0];   /* out */
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.
