kcsan: Document static blacklisting options

Updates the section on "Selective analysis", listing all available
options to blacklist reporting data races for: specific accesses,
functions, compilation units, and entire directories.

These options should provide adequate control for maintainers to opt out
of KCSAN analysis at varying levels of granularity. It is hoped to
provide the required control to reflect preferences for handling data
races across the kernel.
