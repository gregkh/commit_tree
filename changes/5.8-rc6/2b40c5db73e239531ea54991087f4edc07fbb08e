selftests/pidfd: add pidfd setns tests

This is basically a test-suite for setns() and as of now contains:
- test that we can't pass garbage flags
- test that we can't attach to the namespaces of  task that has already exited
- test that we can incrementally setns into all namespaces of a target task
  using a pidfd
- test that we can setns atomically into all namespaces of a target task
- test that we can't cross setns into a user namespace outside of our user
  namespace hierarchy
- test that we can't setns into namespaces owned by user namespaces over which
  we are not privileged
