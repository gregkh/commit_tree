KVM: X86: Force ASYNC_PF_PER_VCPU to be power of two

Forcing the ASYNC_PF_PER_VCPU to be power of two is much easier to be
used rather than calling roundup_pow_of_two() from time to time.  Do
this by adding a BUILD_BUG_ON() inside the hash function.

Another point is that generally async pf does not allow concurrency
over ASYNC_PF_PER_VCPU after all (see kvm_setup_async_pf()), so it
does not make much sense either to have it not a power of two or some
of the entries will definitely be wasted.
