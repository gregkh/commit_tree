spi: flags 'SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_RX' and 'SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_TX' can't be coexit with 'SPI_3WIRE' mode

since chip spi driver need get the transfer direction by 'tx_buf' and
'rx_buf' of 'struct spi_transfer' in 'SPI_3WIRE' mode.

so, we need bypass 'SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_RX' and 'SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_TX'
feature in 'SPI_3WIRE' mode
