KVM: arm64: Make KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS compatible with the selected GIC version

KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS always return the maximum possible number of
VCPUs, irrespective of the selected interrupt controller. This
is pretty misleading for userspace that selects a GICv2 on a GICv3
system that supports v2 compat: It always gets a maximum of 512
VCPUs, even if the effective limit is 8. The 9th VCPU will fail
to be created, which is unexpected as far as userspace is concerned.

Fortunately, we already have the right information stashed in the
kvm structure, and we can return it as requested.
