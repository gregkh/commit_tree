bus: bt1-axi: Build the driver into the kernel

Alas the method trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() isn't exported by the
kernel, but we need to have it called in case of the bus errors detected
to get a better description of a possible cause of the error. Let's
disable the ability to build the driver as a loadable kernel module then.
Note In future the driver will support the AXI-bus interconnect capability,
so we'd have to make it built into the kernel anyway.
