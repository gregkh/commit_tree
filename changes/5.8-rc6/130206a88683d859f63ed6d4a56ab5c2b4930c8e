usb: typec: mux: intel_pmc_mux: Fix DP alternate mode entry

The PMC needs to be notified separately about HPD (hotplug
detected) signal being high after mode entry. There is a bit
"HPD High" in the Alternate Mode Request that the driver
already sets, but that bit is only valid when the
DisplayPort Alternate Mode is directly entered from
disconnected state.
