x86/entry: Clean up idtentry_enter/exit() leftovers

Now that everything is converted to conditional RCU handling remove
idtentry_enter/exit() and tidy up the conditional functions.

This does not remove rcu_irq_exit_preempt(), to avoid conflicts with the RCU
tree. Will be removed once all of this hits Linus's tree.
