Drivers: hv: vmbus: Don't bind the offer&rescind works to a specific CPU

The offer and rescind works are currently scheduled on the so called
"connect CPU".  However, this is not really needed: we can synchronize
the works by relying on the usage of the offer_in_progress counter and
of the channel_mutex mutex.  This synchronization is already in place.
So, remove this unnecessary "bind to the connect CPU" constraint and
update the inline comments accordingly.
