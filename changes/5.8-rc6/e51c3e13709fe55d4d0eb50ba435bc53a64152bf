powerpc/entry32: Blacklist exception exit points for kprobe.

kprobe does not handle events happening in real mode.

The very last part of exception exits cannot support a trap.
Blacklist them from kprobe.

While we are at it, remove exc_exit_start symbol which is not
used to avoid having to blacklist it.
