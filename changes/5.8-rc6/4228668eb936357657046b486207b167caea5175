ASoC: Intel: SOF: merge COMETLAKE_LP and COMETLAKE_H

We already have two configurations for CometLake, and a third one
coming. On other platforms, we used a single Kconfig option, so we
should follow the same trend by merging the two cases in a backwards
compatible way.

The backwards compatibility is handled by overloading the COMETLAKE_LP
kconfig as COMETLAKE. In practice we've never seen a case where
COMETLAKE_H is not selected along with COMETLAKE_LP, so keeping one
of the two is enough.
