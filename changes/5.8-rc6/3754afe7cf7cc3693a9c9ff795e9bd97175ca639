tools/kvm_stat: Add command line switch '-L' to log to file

To integrate with logrotate, we have a signal handler that will re-open
the logfile.
Assuming we have a systemd unit file with
     ExecStart=kvm_stat -dtc -s 10 -L /var/log/kvm_stat.csv
     ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
and a logrotate config featuring
     postrotate
        /bin/systemctl reload kvm_stat.service
     endscript
Then the overall flow will look like this:
(1) systemd starts kvm_stat, logging to A.
(2) At some point, logrotate runs, moving A to B.
    kvm_stat continues to write to B at this point.
(3) After rotating, logrotate restarts the kvm_stat unit via systemctl.
(4) The kvm_stat unit sends a SIGHUP to kvm_stat, finally making it
    switch over to writing to A again.
Note that in order to keep the structure of the cvs output in tact, we
make sure to, in contrast to the standard log format, only write the
header once at the beginning of a file. This implies that the header is
suppressed when appending to an existing file. Unlike with the standard
format, where we append to an existing file by starting out with a
header.
