ALSA: hda/realtek - Enable micmute LED on and HP system

Though the system uses DMIC, headset mic still uses the HDA, let's use
GPIO 0x1 to control the micmute LED.

The micmute LED GPIO has a different polarity to the mute LED GPIO, we
can use the newly added micmute_led_polarity to indicate that.
