e1000e: fix unused-function warning

The CONFIG_PM_SLEEP #ifdef checks in this file are inconsistent,
leading to a warning about sometimes unused function:

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c:137:13: error: unused function 'e1000e_check_me' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]

Rather than adding more #ifdefs, just remove them completely
and mark the PM functions as __maybe_unused to let the compiler
work it out on it own.
