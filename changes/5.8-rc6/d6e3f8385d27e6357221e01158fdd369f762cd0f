KVM: nVMX: Invalidate all roots when emulating INVVPID without EPT

Free all roots when emulating INVVPID for L1 and EPT is disabled, as
outstanding changes to the page tables managed by L1 need to be
recognized.  Because L1 and L2 share an MMU when EPT is disabled, and
because VPID is not tracked by the MMU role, all roots in the current
MMU (root_mmu) need to be freed, otherwise a future nested VM-Enter or
VM-Exit could do a fast CR3 switch (without a flush/sync) and consume
stale SPTEs.
