clocksource/drivers/versatile: Allow CONFIG_CLKSRC_VERSATILE to be disabled

The timer-versatile driver provides a sched_clock for certain Arm Ltd.
reference platforms. Specifically, it is used on Versatile and 32-bit
VExpress. It is not needed for those platforms with an arch timer (all
the 64-bit ones) yet CONFIG_MFD_VEXPRESS_SYSREG does still need to be
enabled. In that case, the timer-versatile can only be disabled when
COMPILE_TEST is enabled which is not desirable. Let's use the sub-arch
kconfig symbols instead.

Realview platforms don't have the sysregs that this driver uses so
correct the help text.
