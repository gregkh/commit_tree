net: ipa: do not cache channel state

It is possible for a GSI channel's state to be changed as a result
of an action by a different execution environment.  Specifically,
the modem is able to issue a GSI generic command that causes a state
change on a GSI channel associated with the AP.

A channel's state only needs to be known when a channel is allocated
or deallocaed, started or stopped, or reset.  So there is little
value in caching the state anyway.

Stop recording a copy of the channel's last known state, and instead
fetch the true state from hardware whenever it's needed.  In such
cases, *do* record the state in a local variable, in case an error
message reports it (so the value reported is the value seen).
