rcu: Fix the (t=0 jiffies) false positive

It is possible that an over-long grace period will end while the RCU
CPU stall warning message is printing.  In this case, the estimate of
the offending grace period's duration can be erroneous due to refetching
of rcu_state.gp_start, which will now be the time of the newly started
grace period.  Computation of this duration clearly needs to use the
start time for the old over-long grace period, not the fresh new one.
This commit avoids such errors by causing both print_other_cpu_stall() and
print_cpu_stall() to reuse the value previously fetched by their caller.
