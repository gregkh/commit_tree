mm: allow swappiness that prefers reclaiming anon over the file workingset

With the advent of fast random IO devices (SSDs, PMEM) and in-memory swap
devices such as zswap, it's possible for swap to be much faster than
filesystems, and for swapping to be preferable over thrashing filesystem
caches.

Allow setting swappiness - which defines the rough relative IO cost of
cache misses between page cache and swap-backed pages - to reflect such
situations by making the swap-preferred range configurable.
