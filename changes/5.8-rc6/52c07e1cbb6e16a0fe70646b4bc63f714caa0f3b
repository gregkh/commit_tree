KVM: MIPS: Use root tlb to control guest's CCA for Loongson-3

KVM guest has two levels of address translation: guest tlb translates
GVA to GPA, and root tlb translates GPA to HPA. By default guest's CCA
is controlled by guest tlb, but Loongson-3 maintains all cache coherency
by hardware (including multi-core coherency and I/O DMA coherency) so it
prefers all guest mappings be cacheable mappings. Thus, we use root tlb
to control guest's CCA for Loongson-3.
