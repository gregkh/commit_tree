ARM: dts: stm32: add sd-uhs properties in SD-card node for stm32mp157c-ed1

The sdmmc1 peripheral is connected on SD-card on STM32MP1-ED1 board.
Add the UHS features the controller is able to manage.
Those features require a level shifter on the board, and the support of
the voltage switch in driver, which is done in Linux v5.7.
