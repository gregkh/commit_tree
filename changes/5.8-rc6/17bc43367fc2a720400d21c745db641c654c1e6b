powerpc/uaccess: Implement unsafe_copy_to_user() as a simple loop

At the time being, unsafe_copy_to_user() is based on
raw_copy_to_user() which calls __copy_tofrom_user().

__copy_tofrom_user() is a big optimised function to copy big amount
of data. It aligns destinations to cache line in order to use
dcbz instruction.

Today unsafe_copy_to_user() is called only from filldir().
It is used to mainly copy small amount of data like filenames,
so __copy_tofrom_user() is not fit.

Also, unsafe_copy_to_user() is used within user_access_begin/end
sections. In those section, it is preferable to not call functions.

Rewrite unsafe_copy_to_user() as a macro that uses __put_user_goto().
We first perform a loop of long, then we finish with necessary
complements.

unsafe_copy_to_user() might be used in the near future to copy
fixed-size data, like pt_regs structs during signal processing.
Having it as a macro allows GCC to optimise it for instead when
it knows the size in advance, it can unloop loops, drop complements
when the size is a multiple of longs, etc ...
