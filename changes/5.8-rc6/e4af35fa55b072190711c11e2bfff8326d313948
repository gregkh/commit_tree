cifs: handle hostnames that resolve to same ip in failover

In order to support reconnect to hostnames that resolve to same ip
address, besides relying on the currently set hostname to match DFS
targets, attempt to resolve the targets and then match their addresses
with the reconnected server ip address.

For instance, if we have two hostnames "FOO" and "BAR", and both
resolve to the same ip address, we would be able to handle failover in
DFS paths like

    \\FOO\dfs\link1 -> [ \BAZ\share2 (*), \BAR\share1 ]
    \\FOO\dfs\link2 -> [ \BAZ\share2 (*), \FOO\share1 ]

so when "BAZ" is no longer accessible, link1 and link2 would get
reconnected despite having different target hostnames.
