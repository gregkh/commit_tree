gpio: dwapb: Drop of_match_ptr() & ACPI_PTR() calls

Since we always have a table of IDs compiled in, there is no use
for of_match_ptr() nor ACPI_PTR() call. Besides that it brings
a warning (depending on configuration):

.../gpio-dwapb.c:638:34: warning: ‘dwapb_of_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
  638 | static const struct of_device_id dwapb_of_match[] = {
      |                                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get rid of them for good.
