btrfs: reloc: refactor direct tree backref processing into its own function

For BTRFS_SHARED_BLOCK_REF_KEY, its processing is straightforward, as we
now the parent node bytenr directly.

If the parent is already cached, or a root, call it a day.
If the parent is not cached, add it pending list.

This patch will just refactor this part into its own function,
handle_direct_tree_backref() and add some comment explaining the
@ref_key parameter.
