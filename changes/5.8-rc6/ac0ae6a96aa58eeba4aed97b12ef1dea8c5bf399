habanalabs: add gaudi asic-dependent code

Add the ASIC-dependent code for GAUDI. Supply (almost) all of the function
callbacks that the driver's common code need to initialize, finalize and
submit workloads to the GAUDI ASIC.

It also contains the code to initialize the F/W of the GAUDI ASIC and to
receive events from the F/W.
