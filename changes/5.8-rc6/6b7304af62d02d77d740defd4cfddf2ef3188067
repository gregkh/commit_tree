btrfs: rename member 'trimming' of block group to a more generic name

Back in 2014, commit 04216820fe83d5 ("Btrfs: fix race between fs trimming
and block group remove/allocation"), I added the 'trimming' member to the
block group structure. Its purpose was to prevent races between trimming
and block group deletion/allocation by pinning the block group in a way
that prevents its logical address and device extents from being reused
while trimming is in progress for a block group, so that if another task
deletes the block group and then another task allocates a new block group
that gets the same logical address and device extents while the trimming
task is still in progress.

After the previous fix for scrub (patch "btrfs: fix a race between scrub
and block group removal/allocation"), scrub now also has the same needs that
trimming has, so the member name 'trimming' no longer makes sense.
Since there is already a 'pinned' member in the block group that refers
to space reservations (pinned bytes), rename the member to 'frozen',
add a comment on top of it to describe its general purpose and rename
the helpers to increment and decrement the counter as well, to match
the new member name.

The next patch in the series will move the helpers into a more suitable
file (from free-space-cache.c to block-group.c).
