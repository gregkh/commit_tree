net: Do not clear the sock TX queue in sk_set_socket()

Clearing the sock TX queue in sk_set_socket() might cause unexpected
out-of-order transmit when called from sock_orphan(), as outstanding
packets can pick a different TX queue and bypass the ones already queued.

This is undesired in general. More specifically, it breaks the in-order
scheduling property guarantee for device-offloaded TLS sockets.

Remove the call to sk_tx_queue_clear() in sk_set_socket(), and add it
explicitly only where needed.
