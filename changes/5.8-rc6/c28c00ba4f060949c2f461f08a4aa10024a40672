scsi: ufs: Introduce fixup_dev_quirks vops

Some UFS deivces may have required device quirks or have non-standard
features which are enabled only on specified UFS hosts or for special
customers.

To not "pollute" common device quirk list, i.e. ufs_fixups table, for those
devices mentioned above, introduce "fixup_dev_quirks" vops to allow vendors
to fix or modify device quirks accordingly.
