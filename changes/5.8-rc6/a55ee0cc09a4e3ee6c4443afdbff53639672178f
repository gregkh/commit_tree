checkpatch: look for c99 comments in ctx_locate_comment

Some checks look for comments around a specific function like
read_barrier_depends.

Extend the check to support both c89 and c90 comment styles.

	c89 /* comment */
or
	c99 // comment

For c99 comments, only look a 3 single lines, the line being scanned,
the line above and the line below the line being scanned rather than
the patch diff context.
