Revert "i2c: tegra: Fix suspending in active runtime PM state"

This reverts commit 9f42de8d4ec2304f10bbc51dc0484f3503d61196.

It's not safe to use pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}(), especially
during the noirq phase of suspend. See also the guidance provided in
commit 1e2ef05bb8cf ("PM: Limit race conditions between runtime PM
and system sleep (v2)").
