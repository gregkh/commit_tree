btrfs: turn space cache writeout failure messages into debug messages

Since commit 1afb648e945428 ("btrfs: use standard debug config option to
enable free-space-cache debug prints"), we started to log error messages
that were never logged before since there was no DEBUG macro defined
anywhere. This started to make test case btrfs/187 to fail very often,
as it greps for any btrfs error messages in dmesg/syslog and fails if
any is found:

(...)
btrfs/186 1s ...  2s

The space cache write failures happen due to ENOSPC when attempting to
update the free space cache items in the root tree. This happens because
when starting or joining a transaction we don't know how many block
groups we will end up changing (due to extent allocation or release) and
therefore never reserve space for updating free space cache items.
More often than not, the free space cache writeout succeeds since the
metadata space info is not yet full nor very close to being full, but
when it is, the space cache writeout fails with ENOSPC.

Occasional failures to write space caches are not considered critical
since they can be rebuilt when mounting the filesystem or the next
attempt to write a free space cache in the next transaction commit might
succeed, so we used to hide those error messages with a preprocessor
check for the existence of the DEBUG macro that was never enabled
anywhere.

A few other generic test cases also trigger the error messages due to
ENOSPC failure when writing free space caches as well, however they don't
fail since they don't grep dmesg/syslog for any btrfs specific error
messages.

So change the messages from 'error' level to 'debug' level, as it doesn't
make much sense to have error messages triggered only if the debug macro
is enabled plus, more importantly, the error is not serious nor highly
unexpected.
