staging: qlge: Remove print statements for lbq_clean_idx and lbq_free_cnt

Remove debug print statements referring to non-existent fields
'lbq_clean_idx' and 'lbq_free_cnt' in the 'rx_ring' struct, which causes
a compilation failure when QL_DEV_DUMP is set.

These fields were initially removed as a part of commit aec626d2092f
("staging: qlge: Update buffer queue prod index despite oom") in 2019.

Their replacement fields ('next_to_use' and 'next_to_clean') are already
being printed, so this patch does not add new debug statements for them.
