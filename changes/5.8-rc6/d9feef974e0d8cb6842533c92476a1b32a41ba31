usb: dwc3: gadget: Continue to process pending requests

If there are still pending requests because no TRB was available,
prepare more when started requests are completed.

Introduce dwc3_gadget_ep_should_continue() to check for incomplete and
pending requests to resume updating new TRBs to the controller's TRB
cache.
