rcu-tasks: Make RCU Tasks Trace make use of RCU scheduler hooks

This commit makes the calls to rcu_tasks_qs() detect and report
quiescent states for RCU tasks trace.  If the task is in a quiescent
state and if ->trc_reader_checked is not yet set, the task sets its own
->trc_reader_checked.  This will cause the grace-period kthread to
remove it from the holdout list if it still remains there.
