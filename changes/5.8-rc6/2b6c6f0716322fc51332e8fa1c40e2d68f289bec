bpf, i386: Remove unneeded conversion to bool

The '==' expression itself is bool, no need to convert it to bool again.
This fixes the following coccicheck warning:

  arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c:1478:50-55: WARNING: conversion to bool not needed here
  arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c:1479:50-55: WARNING: conversion to bool not needed here
