kcsan: Introduce kcsan_value_change type

Introduces kcsan_value_change type, which explicitly points out if we
either observed a value-change (TRUE), or we could not observe one but
cannot rule out a value-change happened (MAYBE). The MAYBE state can
either be reported or not, depending on configuration preferences.

A follow-up patch introduces the FALSE state, which should never be
reported.

No functional change intended.
