net: hns3: change the order of reinitializing RoCE and NIC client during reset

The HNS RDMA driver will support VF device later, whose
re-initialization should be done after PF's. This patch
changes the order of hclge_reset_prepare_up() and
hclge_notify_roce_client(), so that PF's RoCE client
will be reinitialized before VF's.
