dt-bindings: thermal: Add yaml bindings for thermal cooling-devices

As part of moving the thermal bindings to YAML, split it up into 3
bindings: thermal sensors, cooling devices and thermal zones.

The property #cooling-cells is required in each device that acts as a
cooling device - whether active or passive. So any device that can
throttle its performance to passively reduce heat dissipation (e.g.
CPUs, GPUs) and any device that can actively dissipate heat at different
levels (e.g. fans) will contain this property.
