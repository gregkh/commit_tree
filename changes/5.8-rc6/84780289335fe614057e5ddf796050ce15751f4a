btrfs: reloc: add backref_cache::pending_edge and backref_cache::useless_node

These two new members will act the same as the existing local lists,
@useless and @list in build_backref_tree().

Currently build_backref_tree() is only executed serially, thus moving
such local list into backref_cache is still safe.

Also since we're here, use list_first_entry() to replace a lot of
list_entry() calls after !list_empty().
