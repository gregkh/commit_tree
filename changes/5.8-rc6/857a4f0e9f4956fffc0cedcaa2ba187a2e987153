ice: Fix resource leak on early exit from function

Memory allocated in the ice_add_prof_id_vsig() function wasn't being
properly freed if an error occurred inside the for-loop in the function.

In particular, 'p' wasn't being freed if an error occurred before it was
added to the resource list at the end of the for-loop.
