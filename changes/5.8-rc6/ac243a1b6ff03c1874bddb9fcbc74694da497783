staging: wfx: re-enable BA after reset

Firmware does not support Block Acks when multiple vif are running.
Thus, wfx_add_interface() and wfx_remove_interface() enable and disable
Block Acks as necessary.

Block Ack policy is also reset after hif_reset(). Driver have to
re-enable it after each call to hif_reset().

This patch reflects this behavior.
