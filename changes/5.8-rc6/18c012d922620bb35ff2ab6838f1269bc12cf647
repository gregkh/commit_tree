iavf: Fix reporting 2.5 Gb and 5Gb speeds

Commit 4ae4916b5643 ("i40e: fix 'Unknown bps' in dmesg for 2.5Gb/5Gb
speeds") added the ability for the PF to report 2.5 and 5Gb speeds,
however, the iavf driver does not recognize those speeds as the values were
not added there. Add the proper enums and values so that iavf can properly
deal with those speeds.
