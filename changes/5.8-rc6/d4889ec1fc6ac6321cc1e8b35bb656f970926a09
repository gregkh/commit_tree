soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Allow RPMHPD driver to be loaded as a module

This patch allow the rpmhpd driver to be loaded as a permenent
module. Meaning it can be loaded from a module, but then cannot
be unloaded.

Ideally, it would include a remove hook and related logic, but
apparently the genpd code isn't able to track usage and cleaning
things up?

So making it a permenent module at least improves things slightly
over requiring it to be a built in driver.
