net/dst: use a smaller percpu_counter batch for dst entries accounting

percpu_counter_add() uses a default batch size which is quite big
on platforms with 256 cpus. (2*256 -> 512)

This means dst_entries_get_fast() can be off by +/- 2*(nr_cpus^2)
(131072 on servers with 256 cpus)

Reduce the batch size to something more reasonable, and
add logic to ip6_dst_gc() to call dst_entries_get_slow()
before calling the _very_ expensive fib6_run_gc() function.
