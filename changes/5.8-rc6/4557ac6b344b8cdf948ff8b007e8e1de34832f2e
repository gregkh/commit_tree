powerpc/64s/exception: Fix 0x1500 interrupt handler crash

A typo caused the interrupt handler to branch immediately to the
common "unknown interrupt" handler and skip the special case test for
denormal cause.

This does not affect KVM softpatch handling (e.g., for POWER9 TM
assist) because the KVM test was moved to common code by commit
9600f261acaa ("powerpc/64s/exception: Move KVM test to common code")
just before this bug was introduced.
