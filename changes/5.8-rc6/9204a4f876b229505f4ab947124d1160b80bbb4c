batman-adv: trace: Drop unneeded types.h include

The commit 04ae87a52074 ("ftrace: Rework event_create_dir()") restructured
various macros in the ftrace framework. These changes also had the nice
side effect that the linux/types.h include is no longer necessary to define
some of the types used by these macros.
