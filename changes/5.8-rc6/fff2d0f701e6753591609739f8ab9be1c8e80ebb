hwmon: (applesmc) avoid overlong udelay()

Building this driver with "clang -O3" produces a link error
after the compiler partially unrolls the loop and 256ms
becomes a compile-time constant that triggers the check
in udelay():

ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: __bad_udelay
>>> referenced by applesmc.c
>>>               hwmon/applesmc.o:(read_smc) in archive drivers/built-in.a

I can see no reason against using a sleeping function here,
as no part of the driver runs in atomic context, so instead use
usleep_range() with a wide range and use jiffies for the
end condition.
