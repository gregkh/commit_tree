drm/i915/execlists: Explicitly reset both reg and context runtime

Upon a GPU reset, we copy the default context image over top of the
guilty image. This will rollback the CTX_TIMESTAMP register to before
our value of ce->runtime.last. Reset both back to 0 so that we do not
encounter an underflow on the next schedule out after resume.

This should not be a huge issue in practice, as hangs should be rare in
correct code.
