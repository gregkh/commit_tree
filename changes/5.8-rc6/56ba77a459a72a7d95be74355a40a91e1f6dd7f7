KVM: x86: Save L1 TSC offset in 'struct kvm_vcpu_arch'

Save L1's TSC offset in 'struct kvm_vcpu_arch' and drop the kvm_x86_ops
hook read_l1_tsc_offset().  This avoids a retpoline (when configured)
when reading L1's effective TSC, which is done at least once on every
VM-Exit.

No functional change intended.
