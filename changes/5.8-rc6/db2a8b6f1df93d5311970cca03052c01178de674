i2c: designware: platdrv: Set class based on DMI

Current AMD's zen-based APUs use this core for some of its i2c-buses.

With this patch we re-enable autodetection of hwmon-alike devices, so
lm-sensors will be able to work automatically.

It does not affect the boot-time of embedded devices, as the class is
set based on the DMI information.

DMI is probed only on Qtechnology QT5222 Industrial Camera Platform.
