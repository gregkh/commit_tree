KVM: x86: Remove superfluous brackets from case statement

Remove unnecessary brackets from a case statement that unintentionally
encapsulates unrelated case statements in the same switch statement.
While technically legal and functionally correct syntax, the brackets
are visually confusing and potentially dangerous, e.g. the last of the
encapsulated case statements has an undocumented fall-through that isn't
flagged by compilers due the encapsulation.
