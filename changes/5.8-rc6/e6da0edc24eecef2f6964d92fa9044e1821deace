Bluetooth: Acquire sk_lock.slock without disabling interrupts

There was a lockdep which led to commit
   fad003b6c8e3d ("Bluetooth: Fix inconsistent lock state with RFCOMM")

Lockdep noticed that `sk->sk_lock.slock' was acquired without disabling
the softirq while the lock was also used in softirq context.
Unfortunately the solution back then was to disable interrupts before
acquiring the lock which however made lockdep happy.
It would have been enough to simply disable the softirq. Disabling
interrupts before acquiring a spinlock_t is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT
because these locks are converted to 'sleeping' spinlocks.

Use spin_lock_bh() in order to acquire the `sk_lock.slock'.
