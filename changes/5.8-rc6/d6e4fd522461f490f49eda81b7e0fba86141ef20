mtd: rawnand: nandsim: Stop using nand_release()

nand_release() basically calls mtd_device_unregister() and
nand_cleanup(). Both helpers should be called after MTD device
registration and NAND scan, respectively. Drop nand_release() and use
the two helpers directly so that they fit the error path and the
labels there.
