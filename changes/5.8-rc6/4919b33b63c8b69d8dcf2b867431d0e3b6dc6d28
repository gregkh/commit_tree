scsi: ibmvscsi: Don't send host info in adapter info MAD after LPM

The adapter info MAD is used to send the client info and receive the host
info as a response. A persistent buffer is used and as such the client info
is overwritten after the response. During the course of a normal adapter
reset the client info is refreshed in the buffer in preparation for sending
the adapter info MAD.

However, in the special case of LPM where we reenable the CRQ instead of a
full CRQ teardown and reset we fail to refresh the client info in the
adapter info buffer. As a result, after Live Partition Migration (LPM) we
erroneously report the host's info as our own.
