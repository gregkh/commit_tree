of: platform: Batch fwnode parsing when adding all top level devices

The fw_devlink_pause() and fw_devlink_resume() APIs allow batching the
parsing of the device tree nodes when a lot of devices are added. This
will significantly cut down parsing time (as much a 1 second on some
systems). So, use them when adding devices for all the top level device
tree nodes in a system.
