KVM: arm64: Stop save/restoring ACTLR_EL1

KVM sets HCR_EL2.TACR via HCR_GUEST_FLAGS. This means ACTLR* accesses
from the guest are always trapped, and always return the value in the
sys_regs array.

The guest can't change the value of these registers, so we are
save restoring the reset value, which came from the host.

Stop save/restoring this register. Keep the storage for this register
in sys_regs[] as this is how the value is exposed to user-space,
removing it would break migration.
