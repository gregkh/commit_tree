MIPS: Loongson: Build ATI Radeon GPU driver as module

When ATI Radeon GPU driver has been compiled directly into the kernel
instead of as a module, we should make sure the firmware for the model
(check available ones in /lib/firmware/radeon) is built-in to the kernel
as well, otherwise there exists the following fatal error during GPU init,
change CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=y to CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m to fix it.

[    1.900997] [drm] Loading RS780 Microcode
[    1.905077] radeon 0000:01:05.0: Direct firmware load for radeon/RS780_pfp.bin failed with error -2
