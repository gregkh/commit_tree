x86/cpu: Use pinning mask for CR4 bits needing to be 0

The X86_CR4_FSGSBASE bit of CR4 should not change after boot[1]. Older
kernels should enforce this bit to zero, and newer kernels need to
enforce it depending on boot-time configuration (e.g. "nofsgsbase").
To support a pinned bit being either 1 or 0, use an explicit mask in
combination with the expected pinned bit values.
