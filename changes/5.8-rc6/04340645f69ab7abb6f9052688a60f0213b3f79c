RDMA/siw: Fix reporting vendor_part_id

Move the initialization of the vendor_part_id to be before calling
ib_register_device(), this is needed because the query_device() callback
is called from the context of ib_register_device() before initializing the
vendor_part_id, so the reported value is wrong.
