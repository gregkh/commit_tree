drm/msm/a4xx: add adreno a405 support

It adds support for adreno a405 found on MSM8939.  The adreno_is_a430()
check in adreno_submit() needs an extension to cover a405.  The
downstream driver suggests it should cover the whole a4xx generation.
That's why it gets changed to adreno_is_a4xx(), while a420 is not
tested though.
