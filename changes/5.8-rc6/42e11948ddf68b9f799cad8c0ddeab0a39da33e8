serial: uartps: Wait for tx_empty in console setup

On some platforms, the log is corrupted while console is being
registered. It is observed that when set_termios is called, there
are still some bytes in the FIFO to be transmitted.

So, wait for tx_empty inside cdns_uart_console_setup before calling
set_termios.
