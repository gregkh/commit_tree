media: ipu3.rst: add yuv-downscaling into pipeline diagram

For ipu3 ImgU image processing, the frame data from TNR can feed into
DDR by Output Formatting System or feed into YUV downscaler to do YUV
downscaling for secondary output, which is usually used for display.
current ImgU image pipeline diagram misses the YUV downscaling,
this patch add it to aligh with actual hardware blocks.
