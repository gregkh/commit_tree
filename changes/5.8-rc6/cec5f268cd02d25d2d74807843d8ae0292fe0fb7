x86/delay: Introduce TPAUSE delay

TPAUSE instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state. The instruction execution wakes up when the time-stamp
counter reaches or exceeds the implicit EDX:EAX 64-bit input value.
The instruction execution also wakes up due to the expiration of
the operating system time-limit or by an external interrupt
or exceptions such as a debug exception or a machine check exception.

TPAUSE offers a choice of two lower power states:
 1. Light-weight power/performance optimized state C0.1
 2. Improved power/performance optimized state C0.2

This way, it can save power with low wake-up latency in comparison to
spinloop based delay. The selection between the two is governed by the
input register.

TPAUSE is available on processors with X86_FEATURE_WAITPKG.
