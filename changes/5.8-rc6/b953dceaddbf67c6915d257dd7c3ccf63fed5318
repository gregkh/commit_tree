dt-bindings: arm: Add smc/hvc transport for SCMI

SCMI could use SMC/HVC as tranports. Since there is no standardized
SMC/HVC function identifier for the same, we need to use vendor
specific id. Add the same into the devicetree binding document.

Also add arm,scmi-smc compatible string for smc/hvc transport
