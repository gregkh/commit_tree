RISC-V: Don't mark init section as non-executable

The head text section (i.e. _start, secondary_start_sbi, etc) and the
init section fall under same page table level-1 mapping.

Currently, the runtime CPU hotplug is broken because we are marking
init section as non-executable which in-turn marks head text section
as non-executable.

Further investigating other architectures, it seems marking the init
section as non-executable is redundant because the init section pages
are anyway poisoned and freed.

To fix broken runtime CPU hotplug, we simply remove the code marking
the init section as non-executable.
