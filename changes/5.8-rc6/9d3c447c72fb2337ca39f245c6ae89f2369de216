The testcase enables APF mechanism in MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_EN with ASYNC_PF_INT
enabled w/o setting MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_INT before, what's worse, interrupt
based APF 'page ready' event delivery depends on in kernel lapic, however,
we didn't bail out when lapic is not in kernel during guest setting
MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_EN which causes the null-ptr-deref in host later.
This patch fixes it.
