fuse: clean up condition for writepage sending

fuse_writepages_fill uses following construction:

if (wpa && ap->num_pages &&
    (A || B || C)) {
        action;
} else if (wpa && D) {
        if (E) {
                the same action;
        }
}

 - ap->num_pages check is always true and can be removed

 - "if" and "else if" calls the same action and can be merged.

Move checking A, B, C, D, E conditions to a helper, add comments.
