arm64: bti: Support building kernel C code using BTI

When running with BTI enabled we need to ask the compiler to enable
generation of BTI landing pads beyond those generated as a result of
pointer authentication instructions being landing pads. Since the two
features are practically speaking unlikely to be used separately we
will make kernel mode BTI depend on pointer authentication in order
to simplify the Makefile.
