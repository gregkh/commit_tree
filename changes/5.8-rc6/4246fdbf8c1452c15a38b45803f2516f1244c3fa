staging: wfx: fix endianness of the struct hif_ind_startup

The struct hif_ind_startup is received from the hardware. So it is
declared as little endian. However, it is also stored in the main driver
structure and used on different places in the driver. Sparse complains
about that:

    drivers/staging/wfx/data_tx.c:388:43: warning: restricted __le16 degrades to integer
    drivers/staging/wfx/bh.c:199:9: warning: restricted __le16 degrades to integer
    drivers/staging/wfx/bh.c:221:62: warning: restricted __le16 degrades to integer

In order to make Sparse happy and to keep access from the driver easy,
this patch declare hif_ind_startup with native endianness.

On reception of this struct, this patch takes care to do byte-swap and
keep Sparse happy.
