ASoC: q6asm: handle EOS correctly

Successful send of EOS command does not indicate that EOS is actually
finished, correct event to wait EOS is finished is EOS_RENDERED event.
EOS_RENDERED means that the DSP has finished processing all the buffers
for that particular session and stream.

This patch fixes EOS handling!
