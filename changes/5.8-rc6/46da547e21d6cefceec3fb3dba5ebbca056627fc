scsi: lpfc: Avoid another null dereference in lpfc_sli4_hba_unset()

Commit cdb42becdd40 ("scsi: lpfc: Replace io_channels for nvme and fcp with
general hdw_queues per cpu") has introduced static checker warnings for
potential null dereferences in 'lpfc_sli4_hba_unset()' and commit 1ffdd2c0440d
("scsi: lpfc: resolve static checker warning in lpfc_sli4_hba_unset") has
tried to fix it.  However, yet another potential null dereference is
remaining.  This commit fixes it.
