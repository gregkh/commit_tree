io_uring: batch reap of dead file registrations

We currently embed and queue a work item per fixed_file_ref_node that
we update, but if the workload does a lot of these, then the associated
kworker-events overhead can become quite noticeable.

Since we rarely need to wait on these, batch them at 1 second intervals
instead. If we do need to wait for them, we just flush the pending
delayed work.
