r8169: remove mask argument from rtl_w0w1_eri

rtl_eri_read() returns the full 32bit value, therefore there's no
benefit in writing back parts of it only. handle it like the vendor
driver and write the full 32 bit always. Omitting the mask argument
avoids some overhead and makes the code better readable.
