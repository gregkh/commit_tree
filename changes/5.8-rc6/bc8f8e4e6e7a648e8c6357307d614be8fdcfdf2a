um: Add a generic "fd" vector transport

Learn to take a pre-opened file-descriptor for vector IO.

Instead of teaching the driver to open a FD in multiple ways, it can
rely on management layer to do it on its behalf. For example, this
allows inheriting a preconfigured device fd or a simple socketpair()
setup, without further arguments, privileges or system access by UML.
