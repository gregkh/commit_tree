drm/amd/display: Fix green screen issue after suspend

[why]
We have seen a green screen after resume from suspend in a Raven system
connected with two displays (HDMI and DP) on X based system. We noticed
that this issue is related to bad DCC metadata from user space which may
generate hangs and consequently an underflow on HUBP. After taking a
deep look at the code path we realized that after resume we try to
restore the commit with the DCC enabled framebuffer but the framebuffer
is no longer valid.

[how]
This problem was only reported on Raven based system and after suspend,
for this reason, this commit adds a new parameter on
fill_plane_dcc_attributes() to give the option of disabling DCC
programmatically. In summary, for disabling DCC we first verify if is a
Raven system and if it is in suspend; if both conditions are true we
disable DCC temporarily, otherwise, it is enabled.
