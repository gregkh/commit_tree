selftests/bpf: Add general instructions for test execution

Getting a clean BPF selftests run involves ensuring latest trunk LLVM/clang
are used, pahole is recent (>=1.16) and config matches the specified
config file as closely as possible.  Add to bpf_devel_QA.rst and point
tools/testing/selftests/bpf/README.rst to it.
