x86/mce: Rename "first" function as "early"

It isn't going to be first on the notifier chain when the CEC is moved
to be a normal user of the notifier chain.

Fix the enum for the MCE_PRIO symbols to list them in reverse order so
that the compiler can give them numbers from low to high priority. Add
an entry for MCE_PRIO_CEC as the highest priority.
