scsi: scsi_debug: Implement ZBC host-aware emulation

Implement ZBC host-aware device model emulation. The main changes from the
host-managed emulation are the device type (TYPE_DISK is used), relaxation
of access checks for read and write operations and different handling of a
sequential write preferred zone write pointer as mandated by the ZBC r05
specifications.

To facilitate the implementation and avoid a lot of "if" statement, the
zmodel field is added to the device information and the z_type field to the
zone state data structure.
