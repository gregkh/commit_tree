mmc: sdhci-msm: Fix error handling for dev_pm_opp_of_add_table()

Even though specifying OPP's in device tree is optional, ignoring all errors
reported by dev_pm_opp_of_add_table() means we can't distinguish between a
missing OPP table and a wrong/buggy OPP table. While missing OPP table
(dev_pm_opp_of_add_table() returns a -ENODEV in such case) can be ignored,
a wrong/buggy OPP table in device tree should make the driver error out.

while we fix that, lets also fix the variable names for opp/opp_table to
avoid confusion and name them opp_table/has_opp_table instead.
