coresight: etmv4: Update default filter and initialisation

Differing default states set on driver init / perf init and as a result
of a sysfs reset.

The ETMv4 can be programmed to trace the entire instruction address range
without the need to use address comparator filter resources.
(Described in the ETMv4.x technical reference manual)

sysfs reset was using this method, perf and default driver init were setup
with an address range comparator for the entire address range.

The perf / driver init has been altered to use the method without needing
any comparator address hardware.

Minor adjustment to the vinst_ctrl register initialisation to ensure
correct zero initialisation.
