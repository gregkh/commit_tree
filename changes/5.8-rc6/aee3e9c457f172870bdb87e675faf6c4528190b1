net/mlx5: Accel: fpga tls fix cast to __be64 and incorrect argument types

tls handle and rcd_sn are actually big endian and not in host format.
Fix that.

Fix the following sparse warnings:
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_accel/tls.c:177:21:
warning: cast to restricted __be64

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_accel/tls.c:178:52:
warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different base types)
    expected unsigned int [usertype] handle
    got restricted __be32 [usertype] handle
