media: tegra-video: Add Tegra210 Video input driver

Tegra210 contains a powerful Video Input (VI) hardware controller
which can support up to 6 MIPI CSI camera sensors.

Each Tegra CSI port can be one-to-one mapped to VI channel and can
capture from an external camera sensor connected to CSI or from
built-in test pattern generator.

Tegra210 supports built-in test pattern generator from CSI to VI.

This patch adds a V4L2 capture driver with a media interface for
Tegra210 built-in CSI to VI test pattern generator.

This patch includes TPG support only and all the video pipeline
configuration happens through the video device node.
