pstore: Convert "records_list" locking to mutex

The pstorefs internal list lock doesn't need to be a spinlock and will
create problems when trying to access the list in the subsequent patch
that will walk the pstorefs records during pstore_unregister(). Change
this to a mutex to avoid may_sleep() warnings when unregistering devices.
