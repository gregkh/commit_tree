Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix QCA6390 memdump failure

QCA6390 memdump VSE sometimes come to bluetooth driver
with wrong sequence number as illustrated as follows:
frame # in dec: frame data in hex
1396: ff fd 01 08 74 05 00 37 8f 14
1397: ff fd 01 08 75 05 00 ff bf 38
1414: ff fd 01 08 86 05 00 fb 5e 4b
1399: ff fd 01 08 77 05 00 f3 44 0a
1400: ff fd 01 08 78 05 00 ca f7 41
it is mistook for controller missing packets, so results
in page fault after overwriting memdump buffer allocated.

Fixed by ignoring QCA6390 sequence number check and
checking buffer space before writing.
