selftests/powerpc: Use proper error code to check fault address

ERR_NX_TRANSLATION(CSB.CC=5) is for internal to VAS for fault handling
and should not used by OS. ERR_NX_AT_FAULT(CSB.CC=250) is the proper
error code should be reported by OS when NX encounters address
translation failure.

This patch uses CC=250 to determine the fault address when the request
is not successful.
