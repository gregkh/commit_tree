KVM: nVMX: Really make emulated nested preemption timer pinned

The PINNED bit is ignored by hrtimer_init. It is only considered when
starting the timer.

When the hrtimer isn't pinned to the same logical processor as the
vCPU thread to be interrupted, the emulated VMX-preemption timer
often fails to adhere to the architectural specification.
