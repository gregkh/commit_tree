spi: rspi: Use requested instead of maximum bit rate

Currently, the RSPI driver always tries to use the maximum configured
bit rate for communicating with a slave device, even if the transfer(s)
in the current message specify a lower rate.

Use the mininum rate specified in the message instead.
Rename rspi_data.max_speed_hz accordingly.
