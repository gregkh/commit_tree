ice: Initialize Flow Director resources

Flow Director allows for redirection based on ntuple rules. Rules are
programmed using the ethtool set-ntuple interface. Supported actions are
redirect to queue and drop.

Setup the initial framework to process Flow Director filters. Create and
allocate resources to manage and program filters to the hardware. Filters
are processed via a sideband interface; a control VSI is created to manage
communication and process requests through the sideband. Upon allocation of
resources, update the hardware tables to accept perfect filters.
