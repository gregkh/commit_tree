xfs: refactor the buffer cancellation table helpers

Replace the somewhat convoluted use of xlog_peek_buffer_cancelled and
xlog_check_buffer_cancelled with two obvious helpers:

 xlog_is_buffer_cancelled, which returns true if there is a buffer in
 the cancellation table, and
 xlog_put_buffer_cancelled, which also decrements the reference count
 of the buffer cancellation table.

Both share a little helper to look up the entry.
