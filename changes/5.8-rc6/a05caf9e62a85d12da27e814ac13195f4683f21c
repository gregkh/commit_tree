drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Use generic orientation-data for Acer S1003

The Acer S1003 has proper DMI strings for sys-vendor and product-name,
so we do not need to match by BIOS-date.

This means that the Acer S1003 can use the generic lcd800x1280_rightside_up
drm_dmi_panel_orientation_data struct which is also used by other quirks.
