tools lib traceevent: Add handler for __builtin_expect()

In order to move pointer checks like IS_ERR_VALUE() out of the hotpath
and into the reader path of a trace event, user space tools need to be
able to parse that. IS_ERR_VALUE() is defined as:

 #define IS_ERR_VALUE() unlikely((unsigned long)(void *)(x) >= (unsigned long)-MAX_ERRNO)

Which eventually turns into:

  __builtin_expect(!!((unsigned long)(void *)(x) >= (unsigned long)-4095), 0)

Now the traceevent parser can handle most of that except for the
__builtin_expect(), which needs to be added.
