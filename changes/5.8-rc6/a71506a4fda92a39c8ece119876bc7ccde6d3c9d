xsk: Move driver interface to xdp_sock_drv.h

Move the AF_XDP zero-copy driver interface to its own include file
called xdp_sock_drv.h. This, hopefully, will make it more clear for
NIC driver implementors to know what functions to use for zero-copy
support.

v4->v5: Fix -Wmissing-prototypes by include header file. (Jakub)
