io_wq: add per-wq work handler instead of per work

io_uring is the only user of io-wq, and now it uses only io-wq callback
for all its requests, namely io_wq_submit_work(). Instead of storing
work->runner callback in each instance of io_wq_work, keep it in io-wq
itself.

pros:
- reduces io_wq_work size
- more robust -- ->func won't be invalidated with mem{cpy,set}(req)
- helps other work
