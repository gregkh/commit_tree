dt: fix broken links due to txt->yaml renames

There are some new broken doc links due to yaml renames
at DT. Developers should really run:

	./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check

in order to solve those issues while submitting patches.
This tool can even fix most of the issues with:

	./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check --fix
