staging: vt6656: vnt_get_rtscts_rsvtime_le replace with rts/cts duration.

rsvtime is the time needed in firmware to process the received
frame time in firmware so they can be the same as vnt_get_rts_duration
or vnt_get_cts_duration where appropriate.

The rts_rrv_time are now all the same timing in vnt_rxtx_rts.

So vnt_get_rtscts_rsvtime_le and and vnt_get_frame_time are no longer
required.
