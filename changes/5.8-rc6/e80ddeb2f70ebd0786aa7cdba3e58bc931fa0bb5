smb3: fix incorrect number of credits when ioctl MaxOutputResponse > 64K

We were not checking to see if ioctl requests asked for more than
64K (ie when CIFSMaxBufSize was > 64K) so when setting larger
CIFSMaxBufSize then ioctls would fail with invalid parameter errors.
When requests ask for more than 64K in MaxOutputResponse then we
need to ask for more than 1 credit.
