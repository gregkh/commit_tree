s390/pci: define kernel parameters for PCI multifunction

Using PCI multifunctions in S390 is a new feature we may want
to ignore to continue provide the same topology as in the past
to userland even if the configuration supports exposing the
topology of a multi-Function device.

A new boolean parameters allows to overwrite the kernel
pci configuration:

- pci=norid when on, disallow the use a new firmware field,
  RID, which provides the PCI <bus>:<device>.<function> part
  of the PCI address.

To be used in the following patches and satisfy the checkpatch.pl
the variable is exposed in pci.h
