efi/x86: Fix build with gcc 4

Commit

  bbf8e8b0fe04 ("efi/libstub: Optimize for size instead of speed")

changed the optimization level for the EFI stub to -Os from -O2.

Andrey Ignatov reports that this breaks the build with gcc 4.8.5.

Testing on godbolt.org, the combination of -Os,
-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables, and ms_abi functions doesn't work,
failing with the error:
  sorry, unimplemented: ms_abi attribute requires
  -maccumulate-outgoing-args or subtarget optimization implying it

This does appear to work with gcc 4.9 onwards.

Add -maccumulate-outgoing-args explicitly to unbreak the build with
pre-4.9 versions of gcc.
