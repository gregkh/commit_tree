drm/i915/tc: Catch TC users accessing FIA registers without enable aux

As described in "drm/i915/tc/icl: Implement TC cold sequences" users
of TC functions should held aux power well during access to avoid
read garbage due HW in TC cold state.

v3:
- renamed is_tc_cold_blocked() to assert_tc_cold_blocked()
- restored the removed 0xffffffff checks
