staging: wfx: call wfx_tx_update_sta() before to destroy tx_priv

The function wfx_notify_buffered_tx() need to know if the frame was
associated to a station. This information is available in the Control
Buffer (CB) of the skb. However, when wfx_notify_buffered_tx() is
called, the CB is no more available. Thus, the caller has to take care
of this information.

wfx_notify_buffered_tx() is a specific case. All the other function are
called before the destruction of the CB. So, this patch align the API of
wfx_notify_buffered_tx() with the other functions. Call it before the CB
was destroyed and drop the extra argument 'has_sta'.

It is also the right time to rename it into wfx_tx_update_sta() (which
is closer to the behavior of the function).
