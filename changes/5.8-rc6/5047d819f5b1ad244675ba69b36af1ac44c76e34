mlxsw: spectrum: Align TC and trap priority

The traffic class (TC) attribute of packet traps determines through which
TC a packet trap will be scheduled through the CPU port.

The priority attribute determines which trap will be triggered in case
several packet traps match a packet.

We try to configure these attributes to the same value for all packet
traps as there is little reason not to.

Some packet traps did not use the same value, so rectify that now.
