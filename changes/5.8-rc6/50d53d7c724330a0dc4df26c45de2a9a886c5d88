memcg: fix memcg_kmem_bypass() for remote memcg charging

While trying to use remote memcg charging in an out-of-tree kernel
module I found it's not working, because the current thread is a
workqueue thread.

As we will probably encounter this issue in the future as the users of
memalloc_use_memcg() grow, and it's nothing wrong for this usage, it's
better we fix it now.
