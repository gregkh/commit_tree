ceph: add read/write latency metric support

Calculate the latency for OSD read requests. Add a new r_end_stamp
field to struct ceph_osd_request that will hold the time of that
the reply was received. Use that to calculate the RTT for each call,
and divide the sum of those by number of calls to get averate RTT.

Keep a tally of RTT for OSD writes and number of calls to track average
latency of OSD writes.
