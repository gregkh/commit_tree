mm, memory_failure: don't send BUS_MCEERR_AO for action required error

Some processes dont't want to be killed early, but in "Action Required"
case, those also may be killed by BUS_MCEERR_AO when sharing memory with
other which is accessing the fail memory.  And sending SIGBUS with
BUS_MCEERR_AO for action required error is strange, so ignore the
non-current processes here.
