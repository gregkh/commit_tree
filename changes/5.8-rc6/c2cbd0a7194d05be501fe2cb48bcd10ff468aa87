ASoC: topology: remove the redundant pass checks

As we have check the 'pass' in the soc_elem_pass_load(), so no need to
check it again in each specific elem_load function, at the same time,
the tplg->pos will be reset to the next header base when the pass is
mismatched, so the increasing of the tplg->pos in these cases made no
sense. Here remove all of them.
