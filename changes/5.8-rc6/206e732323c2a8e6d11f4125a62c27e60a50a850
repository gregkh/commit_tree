net: bridge: enfore alignment for ethernet address

The eth_addr member is passed to ether_addr functions that require
2-byte alignment, therefore the member must be properly aligned
to avoid unaligned accesses.

The problem is in place since the initial merge of multicast to unicast:
commit 6db6f0eae6052b70885562e1733896647ec1d807 bridge: multicast to unicast
