irqchip/sifive-plic: Set default irq affinity in plic_irqdomain_map()

For multiple PLIC instances, each PLIC can only target a subset of
CPUs which is represented by "lmask" in the "struct plic_priv".

Currently, the default irq affinity for each PLIC interrupt is all
online CPUs which is illegal value for default irq affinity when we
have multiple PLIC instances. To fix this, we now set "lmask" as the
default irq affinity in for each interrupt in plic_irqdomain_map().
