floppy: cleanup: make result() not rely on current_fdc anymore

Now the fdc is passed in argument so that the function does not
use current_fdc anymore.

It's worth noting that there's still a single reply_buffer[] which
will store the result for the current fdc. It may or may not make
sense to implement one buffer per fdc in the future.
