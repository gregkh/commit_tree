iwlwifi: mvm: set properly station flags in STA_HE_CTXT_CMD

For ACK_ENABLED and 32BIT_BA_BITMAP flags check the station capabilities
rather than bss_conf.ack_enabled and bss_conf.multi_sta_back_32bit.
These fields are stations capabilities and should not be in bss_conf.
Also note that the bss_conf flags are set in station mode only.
In the next patch I will remove ack_enabled and multi_sta_back_32bit
from the bss_conf structure.
