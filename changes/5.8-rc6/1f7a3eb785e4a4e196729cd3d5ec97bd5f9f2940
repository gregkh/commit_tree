Revert "soc: qcom: rpmh: Allow RPMH driver to be loaded as a module"

Attempting to compile rpmh-rsc.c as a module with TRACING enabled causes
a build error as no _rcuidle function is generated for tracepoints when
CONFIG_MODULE is set.

Attempts has been made, but no resolution has been agreed upon, so lets
revert this commit for now.

This reverts commit 1d3c6f86fd3f8b88c707f56d8c3f94e014b40e83.
