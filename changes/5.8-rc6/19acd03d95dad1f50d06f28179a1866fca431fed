kcsan: Add __kcsan_{enable,disable}_current() variants

The __kcsan_{enable,disable}_current() variants only call into KCSAN if
KCSAN is enabled for the current compilation unit. Note: This is
typically not what we want, as we usually want to ensure that even calls
into other functions still have KCSAN disabled.

These variants may safely be used in header files that are shared
between regular kernel code and code that does not link the KCSAN
runtime.
