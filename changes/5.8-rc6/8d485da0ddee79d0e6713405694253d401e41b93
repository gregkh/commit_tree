thermal/int340x_thermal: Don't require IDSP to exist

The IDSP method doesn't appear to exist on the most recent Intel platforms:
instead, the IDSP data is included in the GDDV blob. Since we probably
don't want to decompress and parse that in-kernel, just allow any UUID to
be written if IDSP is missing.
