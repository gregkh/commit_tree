perf flamegraph: Use /bin/bash for report and record scripts

As all the other tools/perf/scripts/python/bin/*-{report,record}
scripts, fixing the this problem reported by Daniel Diaz:

  Our OpenEmbedded builds detected an issue with 5287f9269206 ("perf
  script: Add flamegraph.py script"):
    ERROR: perf-1.0-r9 do_package_qa: QA Issue:
  /usr/libexec/perf-core/scripts/python/bin/flamegraph-report contained
  in package perf-python requires /usr/bin/sh, but no providers found in
  RDEPENDS_perf-python? [file-rdeps]

  This means that there is a new binary pulled in in the shebang line
  which was unaccounted for: `/usr/bin/sh`. I don't see any other usage
  of /usr/bin/sh in the kernel tree (does not even exist on my Ubuntu
  dev machine) but plenty of /bin/sh. This patch is needed:
