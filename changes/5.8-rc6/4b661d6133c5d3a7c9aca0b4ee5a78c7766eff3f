arm64: arch_timer: Disable the compat vdso for cores affected by ARM64_WORKAROUND_1418040

ARM64_WORKAROUND_1418040 requires that AArch32 EL0 accesses to
the virtual counter register are trapped and emulated by the kernel.
This makes the vdso pretty pointless, and in some cases livelock
prone.

Provide a workaround entry that limits the vdso to 64bit tasks.
