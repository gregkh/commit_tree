modpost: fix -i (--ignore-errors) MAKEFLAGS detection

$(filter -i,$(MAKEFLAGS)) works only in limited use-cases.

The representation of $(MAKEFLAGS) depends on various factors:
  - GNU Make version (version 3.8x or version 4.x)
  - The presence of other flags like -j

In my experiments, $(MAKEFLAGS) is expanded as follows:

  * GNU Make 3.8x:

    * without -j option:
      --no-print-directory -Rri

    * with -j option:
      --no-print-directory -Rr --jobserver-fds=3,4 -j -i

  * GNU Make 4.x:

    * without -j option:
      irR --no-print-directory

    * with -j option:
      irR -j --jobserver-fds=3,4 --no-print-directory

For GNU Make 4.x, the flags are grouped as 'irR', which does not work.

For the single thread build with GNU Make 3.8x, the flags are grouped
as '-Rri', which does not work either.

To make it work for all cases, do likewise as commit 6f0fa58e4596
("kbuild: simplify silent build (-s) detection").

BTW, since commit ff9b45c55b26 ("kbuild: modpost: read modules.order
instead of $(MODVERDIR)/*.mod"), you also need to pass -k option to
build final *.ko files. 'make -i -k' ignores compile errors in modules,
and build as many remaining *.ko as possible.

Please note this feature is kind of dangerous if other modules depend
on the broken module because the generated modules will lack the correct
module dependency or CRC. Honestly, I am not a big fan of it, but I am
keeping this feature.
