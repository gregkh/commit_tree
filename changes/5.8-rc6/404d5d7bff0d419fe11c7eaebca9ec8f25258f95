KVM: X86: Introduce more exit_fastpath_completion enum values

Adds a fastpath_t typedef since enum lines are a bit long, and replace
EXIT_FASTPATH_SKIP_EMUL_INS with two new exit_fastpath_completion enum values.

- EXIT_FASTPATH_EXIT_HANDLED  kvm will still go through it's full run loop,
                              but it would skip invoking the exit handler.

- EXIT_FASTPATH_REENTER_GUEST complete fastpath, guest can be re-entered
                              without invoking the exit handler or going
                              back to vcpu_run
