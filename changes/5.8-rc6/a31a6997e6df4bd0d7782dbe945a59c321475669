ata: libata-core: fix a doc warning

The docs toolchain doesn't recognise this pattern:

	@link->[hw_]sata_spd_limit

As it can't really process it. So, instead, let's mark it with
a literal block markup:

	``link->[hw_]sata_spd_limit``

in order to get rid of the following warning:

	./drivers/ata/libata-core.c:5974: WARNING: Unknown target name: "hw".
