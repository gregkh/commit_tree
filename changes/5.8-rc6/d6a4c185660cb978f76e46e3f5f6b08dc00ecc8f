vfio iommu: Implementation of ioctl for dirty pages tracking

VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES ioctl performs three operations:
- Start dirty pages tracking while migration is active
- Stop dirty pages tracking.
- Get dirty pages bitmap. Its user space application's responsibility to
  copy content of dirty pages from source to destination during migration.

To prevent DoS attack, memory for bitmap is allocated per vfio_dma
structure. Bitmap size is calculated considering smallest supported page
size. Bitmap is allocated for all vfio_dmas when dirty logging is enabled

Bitmap is populated for already pinned pages when bitmap is allocated for
a vfio_dma with the smallest supported page size. Update bitmap from
pinning functions when tracking is enabled. When user application queries
bitmap, check if requested page size is same as page size used to
populated bitmap. If it is equal, copy bitmap, but if not equal, return
error.
