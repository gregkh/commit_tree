r8169: switch from netif_xxx message functions to netdev_xxx

Considering the few messages we have in the driver, there's not really
a benefit in being able to control them on a message type level.
Therefore simplify the code and switch to the netdev_xxx message
functions. In addition add net_ratelimit() to messages that can be
printed from a hot path.
