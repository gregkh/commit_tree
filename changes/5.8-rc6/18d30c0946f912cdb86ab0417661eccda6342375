i2c: pxa: remove some unnecessary debug

Remove unnecessary show_state() in the loop inside
i2c_pxa_pio_set_master(), which can be unnecessarily verbose.

Remove the i2c_pxa_scream_blue_murder() in i2c_pxa_pio_xfer(), which
will trigger if we are probing the I2C bus and a slave does not
respond; this is a normal event, and not something to report.
