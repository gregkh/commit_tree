usb: musb: start session in resume for host port

Commit 17539f2f4f0b ("usb: musb: fix enumeration after resume") replaced
musb_start() in musb_resume() to not override softconnect bit, but it
doesn't restart the session for host port which was done in musb_start().
The session could be disabled in musb_suspend(), which leads the host
port doesn't stay in host mode.

So let's start the session specifically for host port in musb_resume().
