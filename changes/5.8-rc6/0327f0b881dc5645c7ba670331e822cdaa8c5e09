spi: dw: Clear DMAC register when done or stopped

If DMAC register is left uncleared any further DMAless transfers
may cause the DMAC hardware handshaking interface getting activated.
So the next DMA-based Rx/Tx transaction will be started right
after the dma_async_issue_pending() method is invoked even if no
DMATDLR/DMARDLR conditions are met. This at the same time may cause
the Tx/Rx FIFO buffers underrun/overrun. In order to fix this we
must clear DMAC register after a current DMA-based transaction is
finished.
