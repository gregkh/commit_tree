drm/core: Add drm_afbc_framebuffer and a corresponding helper

The new struct contains afbc-specific data.

The new function can be used by drivers which support afbc to complete
the preparation of struct drm_afbc_framebuffer. It must be called after
allocating the said struct and calling drm_gem_fb_init_with_funcs().
