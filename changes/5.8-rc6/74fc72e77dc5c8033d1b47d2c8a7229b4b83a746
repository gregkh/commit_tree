arm64: vdso: remove aarch32_vdso_pages[]

The aarch32_vdso_pages[] array is unnecessarily confusing. We only ever
use the C_VECTORS and C_SIGPAGE slots, and the other slots are unused
despite having corresponding mappings (sharing pages with the AArch64
vDSO).

Let's make this clearer by using separate variables for the vectors page
and the sigreturn page. A subsequent patch will clean up the C_* naming
and conflation of pages with mappings.

Note that since both the vectors page and sig page are single
pages, and the mapping is a single page long, their pages array do not
need to be NULL-terminated (and this was not the case with the existing
code for the sig page as it was the last entry in the aarch32_vdso_pages
array).

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
