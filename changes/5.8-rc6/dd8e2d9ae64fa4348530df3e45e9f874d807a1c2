x86/entry: Move irq tracing on syscall entry to C-code

Now that the C entry points are safe, move the irq flags tracing code into
the entry helper:

    - Invoke lockdep before calling into context tracking

    - Use the safe trace_hardirqs_on_prepare() trace function after context
      tracking established state and RCU is watching.

enter_from_user_mode() is also still invoked from the exception/interrupt
entry code which still contains the ASM irq flags tracing. So this is just
a redundant and harmless invocation of tracing / lockdep until these are
removed as well.
