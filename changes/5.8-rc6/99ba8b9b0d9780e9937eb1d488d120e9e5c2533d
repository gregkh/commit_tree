dmaengine: dw: Initialize channel before each transfer

In some cases DMA can be used only with a consumer which does runtime power
management and on the platforms, that have DMA auto power gating logic
(see comments in the drivers/acpi/acpi_lpss.c), may result in DMA losing
its context. Simple mitigation of this issue is to initialize channel
each time the consumer initiates a transfer.
