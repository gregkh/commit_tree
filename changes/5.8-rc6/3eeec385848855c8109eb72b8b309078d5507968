x86/entry: Provide idtentry_entry/exit_cond_rcu()

After a lengthy discussion [1] it turned out that RCU does not need a full
rcu_irq_enter/exit() when RCU is already watching. All it needs if
NOHZ_FULL is active is to check whether the tick needs to be restarted.

This allows to avoid a separate variant for the pagefault handler which
cannot invoke rcu_irq_enter() on a kernel pagefault which might sleep.

The cond_rcu argument is only temporary and will be removed once the
existing users of idtentry_enter/exit() have been cleaned up. After that
the code can be significantly simplified.
