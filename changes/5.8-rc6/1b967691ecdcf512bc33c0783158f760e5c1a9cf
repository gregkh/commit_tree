usb: musb: return -ESHUTDOWN in urb when three-strikes error happened

When a USB device attached to a hub got disconnected, MUSB controller
generates RXCSR_RX_ERROR interrupt for the 3-strikes-out error.

Currently the MUSB host driver returns -EPROTO in current URB, then the
USB device driver could immediately resubmit the URB which causes MUSB
generate RXCSR_RX_ERROR interrupt again. This circle causes interrupt
storm then the hub never got a chance to report the USB device detach.

To fix the interrupt storm, change the URB return code to -ESHUTDOWN for
MUSB_RXCSR_H_ERROR interrupt, so that the USB device driver will not
immediately resubmit the URB.
