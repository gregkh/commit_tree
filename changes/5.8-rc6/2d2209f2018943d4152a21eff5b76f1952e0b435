net/smc: first part of add link processing as SMC server

First set of functions to process an ADD_LINK LLC request as an SMC
server. Find an alternate IB device, determine the new link group type
and get the index for the new link. Then initialize the link and send
the ADD_LINK LLC message to the peer. Save the contents of the response,
ready the link, map all used buffers and register the buffers with the
IB device. If any error occurs, stop the processing and clear the link.
And call smc_llc_srv_add_link() in af_smc.c to start second link
establishment after the initial link of a link group was created.
