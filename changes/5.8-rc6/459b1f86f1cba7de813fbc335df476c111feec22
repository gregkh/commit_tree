firmware: qcom_scm: fix bogous abuse of dma-direct internals

As far as the device is concerned the dma address is the physical
address.  There is no need to convert it to a physical address,
especially not using dma-direct internals that are not available
to drivers and which will interact badly with IOMMUs.  Last but not
least the commit introducing it claimed to just fix a type issue,
but actually changed behavior.
