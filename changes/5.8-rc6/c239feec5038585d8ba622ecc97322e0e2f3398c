iwlwifi: pcie: gen2: use DMA pool for byte-count tables

Since the recent patch in this area, we no longer allocate 64k
for a single queue, but only 1k, which still means a full page.
Use a DMA pool to reduce this further, since we will have a lot
of queues in a typical system that can share pages.
