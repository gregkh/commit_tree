selftests/bpf: Install generated test progs

Before commit 74b5a5968fe8 ("selftests/bpf: Replace test_progs and
test_maps w/ general rule") selftests/bpf used generic install
target from selftests/lib.mk to install generated bpf test progs
by mentioning them in TEST_GEN_FILES variable.

Take that functionality back.
