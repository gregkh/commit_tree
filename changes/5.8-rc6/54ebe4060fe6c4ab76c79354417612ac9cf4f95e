um: Use fdatasync() when mapping the UBD FSYNC command

We do not need to update the metadata (atime, mtime, etc)
on the UBD file and/or the COW file until UML exits.

UBD image mtime is checked in UML only when opening
the files. After that they are locked and used
exclusively by a single UML instance, so there is
no point wasting resources on updating metadata on
every sync. We can sync data only. The host will
always update mtime if a file has been modified upon
closing it.
