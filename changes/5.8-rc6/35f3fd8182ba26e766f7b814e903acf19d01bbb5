drm/i915/execlists: Workaround switching back to a completed context

In what seems remarkably similar to the w/a required to not reload an
idle context with HEAD==TAIL, it appears we must prevent the HW from
switching to an idle context in ELSP[1], while simultaneously trying to
preempt the HW to run another context and a continuation of the idle
context (which is no longer idle).

We can achieve this by preventing the context from completing while we
reload a new ELSP (by applying ring_set_paused(1) across the whole of
dequeue), except this eventually fails due to a lite-restore into a
waiting semaphore does not generate an ACK. Instead, we try to avoid
making the GPU do anything too challenging and not submit a new ELSP
while the interrupts + CSB events appear to have fallen behind the
completed contexts. We expect it to catch up shortly so we queue another
tasklet execution and hope for the best.
