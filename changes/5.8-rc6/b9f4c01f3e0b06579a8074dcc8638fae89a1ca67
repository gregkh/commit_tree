selftest/bpf: Make bpf_iter selftest compilable against old vmlinux.h

It's good to be able to compile bpf_iter selftest even on systems that don't
have the very latest vmlinux.h, e.g., for libbpf tests against older kernels in
Travis CI. To that extent, re-define bpf_iter_meta and corresponding bpf_iter
context structs in each selftest. To avoid type clashes with vmlinux.h, rename
vmlinux.h's definitions to get them out of the way.
