efi/libstub: Use snprintf with %ls to convert the command line

Now we can use snprintf to do the UTF-16 to UTF-8 translation for the
command line.

Drop the special "zero" trick to handle an empty command line. This was
unnecessary even before this since with options_chars == 0,
efi_utf16_to_utf8 would not have accessed options at all. snprintf won't
access it either with a precision of 0.
