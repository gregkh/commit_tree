soc: qcom: rpmpd: Allow RPMPD driver to be loaded as a module

This patch allow the rpmpd driver to be loaded as a permenent
module. Meaning it can be loaded from a module, but then cannot
be unloaded.

Ideally, it would include a remove hook and related logic, but
apparently the genpd code isn't able to track usage and cleaning
things up? (See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/1/24/38)

So making it a permenent module at least improves things slightly
over requiring it to be a built in driver.
