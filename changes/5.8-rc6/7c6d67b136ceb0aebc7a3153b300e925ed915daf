ath10k: Skip handling del_server during driver exit

The qmi infrastructure sends the client a del_server
event when the client releases its qmi handle. This
is not the msg indicating the actual qmi server exiting.
In such cases the del_server msg should not be processed,
since the wifi firmware does not reset its qmi state.

Hence skip the processing of del_server event when the
driver is unloading.

Tested HW: WCN3990
Tested FW: WLAN.HL.3.1-01040-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
