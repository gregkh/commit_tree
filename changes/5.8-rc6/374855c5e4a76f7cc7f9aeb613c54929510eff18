tools lib traceevent: Add API to read time information from kbuffer

Add the functions kbuffer_subbuf_timestamp() and kbuffer_ptr_delta() to
get the timing data stored in the ring buffer that is used to produced
the time stamps of the records.

This is useful for tools like trace-cmd to be able to display the
content of the read data to understand why the records show the time
stamps that they do.
