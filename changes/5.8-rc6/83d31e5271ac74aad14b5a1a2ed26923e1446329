KVM: nVMX: fixes for preemption timer migration

Commit 850448f35aaf ("KVM: nVMX: Fix VMX preemption timer migration",
2020-06-01) accidentally broke nVMX live migration from older version
by changing the userspace ABI.  Restore it and, while at it, ensure
that vmx->nested.has_preemption_timer_deadline is always initialized
according to the KVM_STATE_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER_DEADLINE flag.
