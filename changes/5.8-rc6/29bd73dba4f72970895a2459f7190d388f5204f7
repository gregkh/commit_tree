net/smc: send failover validation message

When a connection is switched to a new link then a link validation
message must be sent to the peer over the new link, containing the
sequence number of the last CDC message that was sent over the old link.
The peer will validate if this sequence number is the same or lower then
the number he received, and abort the connection if messages were lost.
Add smcr_cdc_msg_send_validation() to send the message validation
message and call it when a connection was switched in
smc_switch_cursor().
