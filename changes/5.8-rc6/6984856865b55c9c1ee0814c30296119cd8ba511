powerpc/powernv/npu: Clean up compound table group initialisation

Re-work the control flow a bit so what's going on is a little clearer.
This also ensures the table_group is only initialised once in the P9
case. This shouldn't be a functional change since all the GPU PCI
devices should have the same table_group configuration, but it does
look strange.
