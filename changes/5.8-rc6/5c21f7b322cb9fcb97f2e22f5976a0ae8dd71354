rcuwait: Introduce prepare_to and finish_rcuwait

This allows further flexibility for some callers to implement
ad-hoc versions of the generic rcuwait_wait_event(). For example,
kvm will need this to maintain tracing semantics. The naming
is of course similar to what waitqueue apis offer.

Also go ahead and make use of rcu_assign_pointer() for both task
writes as it will make the __rcu sparse people happy - this will
be the special nil case, thus no added serialization.
