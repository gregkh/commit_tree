btrfs: reloc: rename mark_block_processed and __mark_block_processed

These two functions are weirdly named, mark_block_processed() in fact
just marks a range dirty unconditionally, while __mark_block_processed()
does extra check before doing the marking.

This patch will open code old mark_block_processed, and rename
__mark_block_processed() to remove the "__" prefix.

Since we're here, also kill the forward declaration, which could also
kill in_block_group() with in_range() macro.
