mlx5: fix xdp data_meta setup in mlx5e_fill_xdp_buff

The helper function xdp_set_data_meta_invalid() must be called after
setting xdp->data as it depends on it.

The bug was introduced in the cited patch below, and cause the kernel
to crash when using BPF helper bpf_xdp_adjust_head() on mlx5 driver.
