mac80211: determine chandef from HE 6 GHz operation

Support connecting to HE 6 GHz APs and mesh networks on 6 GHz,
where the HT/VHT information is missing but instead the HE 6 GHz
band capability is present, and the 6 GHz Operation information
field is used to encode the channel configuration instead of the
HT/VHT operation elements.

Also add some other bits needed to connect to 6 GHz networks.
