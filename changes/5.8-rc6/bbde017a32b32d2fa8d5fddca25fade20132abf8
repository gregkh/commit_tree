io_uring: add memory barrier to synchronize io_kiocb's result and iopoll_completed

In io_complete_rw_iopoll(), stores to io_kiocb's result and iopoll
completed are two independent store operations, to ensure that once
iopoll_completed is ture and then req->result must been perceived by
the cpu executing io_do_iopoll(), proper memory barrier should be used.

And in io_do_iopoll(), we check whether req->result is EAGAIN, if it is,
we'll need to issue this io request using io-wq again. In order to just
issue a single smp_rmb() on the completion side, move the re-submit work
to io_iopoll_complete().
