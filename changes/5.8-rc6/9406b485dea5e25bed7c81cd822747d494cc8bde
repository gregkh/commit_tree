tools/bpftool: Add bpf_iter support for bptool

Currently, only one command is supported
  bpftool iter pin <bpf_prog.o> <path>

It will pin the trace/iter bpf program in
the object file <bpf_prog.o> to the <path>
where <path> should be on a bpffs mount.

For example,
  $ bpftool iter pin ./bpf_iter_ipv6_route.o \
    /sys/fs/bpf/my_route
User can then do a `cat` to print out the results:
  $ cat /sys/fs/bpf/my_route
    fe800000000000000000000000000000 40 00000000000000000000000000000000 ...
    00000000000000000000000000000000 00 00000000000000000000000000000000 ...
    00000000000000000000000000000001 80 00000000000000000000000000000000 ...
    fe800000000000008c0162fffebdfd57 80 00000000000000000000000000000000 ...
    ff000000000000000000000000000000 08 00000000000000000000000000000000 ...
    00000000000000000000000000000000 00 00000000000000000000000000000000 ...

The implementation for ipv6_route iterator is in one of subsequent
patches.

This patch also added BPF_LINK_TYPE_ITER to link query.

In the future, we may add additional parameters to pin command
by parameterizing the bpf iterator. For example, a map_id or pid
may be added to let bpf program only traverses a single map or task,
similar to kernel seq_file single_open().

We may also add introspection command for targets/iterators by
leveraging the bpf_iter itself.
