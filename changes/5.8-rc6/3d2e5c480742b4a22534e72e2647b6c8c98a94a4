ASoC: SOF: Intel: BYT: harden IPC initialization and handling

On probe and reset, we should not touch the SHIM_IMRD register since
it is configured by firmware.

The driver only configures SHIM_IMRX with the BUSY interrupt enabled
by default and DONE interrupt disabled. When sending an IPC message,
the DONE interrupt is enabled until the DSP response is provided.

This sequence hardens the IPC communication and avoid
interrupt-related issues when adding/removing modules or during system
suspend-resume transitions.
