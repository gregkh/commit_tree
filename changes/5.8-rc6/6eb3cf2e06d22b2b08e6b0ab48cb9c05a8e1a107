drm/amd/display: Only revalidate bandwidth on medium and fast updates

[Why]
Changes that are fast don't require updating DLG parameters making
this call unnecessary. Considering this is an expensive call it should
not be done on every flip.

DML touches clocks, p-state support, DLG params and a few other DC
internal flags and these aren't expected during fast. A hang has been
reported with this change when called on every flip which suggests that
modifying these fields is not recommended behavior on fast updates.

[How]
Guard the validation to only happen if update type isn't FAST.
