afs: Fix handling of CB.ProbeUuid cache manager op

The AFS filesystem driver is handling the CB.ProbeUuid request incorrectly.
The UUID presented in the request is that of the cache manager, not the
fileserver, so afs_deliver_cb_probe_uuid() shouldn't be using that UUID to
look up the server.

Fix this by looking up the server by address instead.
