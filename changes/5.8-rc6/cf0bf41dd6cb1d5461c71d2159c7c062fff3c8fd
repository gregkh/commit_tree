ice: Reset VF for all port VLAN changes from host

Currently the PF is modifying the VF's port VLAN on the fly when
configured via iproute. This is okay for most cases, but if the VF
already has guest VLANs configured the PF has to remove all of those
filters so only VLAN tagged traffic that matches the port VLAN will
pass. Instead of adding functionality to track which guest VLANs have
been added, just reset the VF each time port VLAN parameters are
modified.
