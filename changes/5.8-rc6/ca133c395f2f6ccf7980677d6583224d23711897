media: atomisp: improve device detection code

- Remove useless check if !dev at the probe function: if
  such function is called, the device is defined.
- Cleanup the PCI ID table using macros.
- Use the same macros at the version-dependent part of the
  atomisp_v4l2.c file;
- Add print messages to help understand what model the
  driver detect;
- If device is not valid, better explain why.
