i2c: designware: Add Baikal-T1 System I2C support

Baikal-T1 System Controller is equipped with a dedicated I2C Controller
which functionality is based on the DW APB I2C IP-core, the only
difference in a way it' registers are accessed. There are three access
register provided in the System Controller registers map, which indirectly
address the normal DW APB I2C registers space. So in order to have the
Baikal-T1 System I2C Controller supported by the common DW APB I2C driver
we created a dedicated Dw I2C controller model quirk, which retrieves the
syscon regmap from the parental dt node and creates a new regmap based on
it.
