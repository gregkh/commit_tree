xhci: Return if xHCI doesn't support LPM

Just return if xHCI is quirked to disable LPM. We can save some time
from reading registers and doing spinlocks.

Add stable tag as we want this patch together with the next one,
"Poll for U0 after disabling USB2 LPM" which fixes a suspend issue
for some USB2 LPM devices
