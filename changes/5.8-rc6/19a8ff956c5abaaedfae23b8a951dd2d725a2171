rcutorture: Add flag to produce non-busy-wait task stalls

This commit aids testing of RCU task stall warning messages by adding
an rcutorture.stall_cpu_block module parameter that results in the
induced stall sleeping within the RCU read-side critical section.
Spinning with interrupts disabled is still available via the
rcutorture.stall_cpu_irqsoff module parameter, and specifying neither
of these two module parameters will spin with preemption disabled.

Note that sleeping (as opposed to preemption) results in additional
complaints from RCU at context-switch time, so yet more testing.
