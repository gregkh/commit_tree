MIPS: Fix IRQ tracing when call handle_fpe() and handle_msa_fpe()

Register "a1" is unsaved in this function,
 when CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS is enabled,
 the TRACE_IRQS_OFF macro will call trace_hardirqs_off(),
 and this may change register "a1".
 The changed register "a1" as argument will be send
 to do_fpe() and do_msa_fpe().
