arm64: dts: rockchip: fix &pinctrl phy sub nodename for rk3399-orangepi

A test with the command below this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-orangepi.dt.yaml: phy:
'#phy-cells' is a required property

'phy' is a reserved nodename and should not be used for pinctrl,
so change it to 'gmac'.

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/dtschema/schemas/
phy/phy-provider.yaml
