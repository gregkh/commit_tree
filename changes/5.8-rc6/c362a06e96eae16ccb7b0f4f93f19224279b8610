net/sched: act_gate: fix configuration of the periodic timer

assigning a dummy value of 'clock_id' to avoid cancellation of the cycle
timer before its initialization was a temporary solution, and we still
need to handle the case where act_gate timer parameters are changed by
commands like the following one:

 # tc action replace action gate <parameters>

the fix consists in the following items:

1) remove the workaround assignment of 'clock_id', and init the list of
   entries before the first error path after IDR atomic check/allocation
2) validate 'clock_id' earlier: there is no need to do IDR atomic
   check/allocation if we know that 'clock_id' is a bad value
3) use a dedicated function, 'gate_setup_timer()', to ensure that the
   timer is cancelled and re-initialized on action overwrite, and also
   ensure we initialize the timer in the error path of tcf_gate_init()

v3: improve comment in the error path of tcf_gate_init() (thanks to
    Vladimir Oltean)
v2: avoid 'goto' in gate_setup_timer (thanks to Cong Wang)
