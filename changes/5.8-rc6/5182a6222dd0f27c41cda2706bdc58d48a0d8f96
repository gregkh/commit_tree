net: dsa: sja1105: fix checks for VLAN state in gate action

This action requires the VLAN awareness state of the switch to be of the
same type as the key that's being added:

- If the switch is unaware of VLAN, then the tc filter key must only
  contain the destination MAC address.
- If the switch is VLAN-aware, the key must also contain the VLAN ID and
  PCP.

But this check doesn't work unless we verify the VLAN awareness state on
both the "if" and the "else" branches.
