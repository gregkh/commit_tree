hugetlbfs: remove hugetlb_add_hstate() warning for existing hstate

hugetlb_add_hstate() prints a warning if the hstate already exists.  This
was originally done as part of kernel command line parsing.  If
'hugepagesz=' was specified more than once, the warning

	pr_warn("hugepagesz= specified twice, ignoring\n");

would be printed.

Some architectures want to enable all huge page sizes.  They would call
hugetlb_add_hstate for all supported sizes.  However, this was done after
command line processing and as a result hstates could have already been
created for some sizes.  To make sure no warning were printed, there would
often be code like:

	if (!size_to_hstate(size)
		hugetlb_add_hstate(ilog2(size) - PAGE_SHIFT)

The only time we want to print the warning is as the result of command
line processing.  So, remove the warning from hugetlb_add_hstate and add
it to the single arch independent routine processing "hugepagesz=".  After
this, calls to size_to_hstate() in arch specific code can be removed and
hugetlb_add_hstate can be called without worrying about warning messages.
