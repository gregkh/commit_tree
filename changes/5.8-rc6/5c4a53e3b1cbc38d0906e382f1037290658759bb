drm/i915/execlists: Track inflight CCID

The presumption is that by using a circular counter that is twice as
large as the maximum ELSP submission, we would never reuse the same CCID
for two inflight contexts.

However, if we continually preempt an active context such that it always
remains inflight, it can be resubmitted with an arbitrary number of
paired contexts. As each of its paired contexts will use a new CCID,
eventually it will wrap and submit two ELSP with the same CCID.

Rather than use a simple circular counter, switch over to a small bitmap
of inflight ids so we can avoid reusing one that is still potentially
active.
