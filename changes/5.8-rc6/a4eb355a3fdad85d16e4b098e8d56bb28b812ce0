arm64: vdso: Fix CFI directives in sigreturn trampoline

Daniel reports that the .cfi_startproc is misplaced for the sigreturn
trampoline, which causes LLVM's unwinder to misbehave:

  | I run into this with LLVMâ€™s unwinder.
  | This combination was always broken.

This prompted Dave to question our use of CFI directives more generally,
and I ended up going down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how this
very poorly documented stuff gets used.

Move the CFI directives so that the "mysterious NOP" is included in
the .cfi_{start,end}proc block and add a bunch of comments so that I
can save myself another headache in future.
