staging: wfx: update list of errors

The device raises error indications when it thinks there is a bug in the
driver and it can't recover it (while it raises exception when a bug is
detected in the device).

The current list of of errors was a bit dated.

This patch cleans up the list of errors and the associated message. It
is also the right time to clean up the way the error indications are
handled. Replace the switch..case with a clean loop over an array.
