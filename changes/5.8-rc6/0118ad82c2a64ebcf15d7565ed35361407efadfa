x86/cpu: Move resctrl CPUID code to resctrl/

The function determining a platform's support and properties of cache
occupancy and memory bandwidth monitoring (properties of
X86_FEATURE_CQM_LLC) can be found among the common CPU code. After
the feature's properties is populated in the per-CPU data the resctrl
subsystem is the only consumer (via boot_cpu_data).

Move the function that obtains the CPU information used by resctrl to
the resctrl subsystem and rename it from init_cqm() to
resctrl_cpu_detect(). The function continues to be called from the
common CPU code. This move is done in preparation of the addition of some
vendor specific code.

No functional change.
