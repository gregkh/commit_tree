objtool: Support multiple stack_op per instruction

Instruction sets can include more or less complex operations which might
not fit the currently defined set of stack_ops.

Combining more than one stack_op provides more flexibility to describe
the behaviour of an instruction. This also reduces the need to define
new stack_ops specific to a single instruction set.

Allow instruction decoders to generate multiple stack_op per
instruction.
