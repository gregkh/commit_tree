mips: Add udelay lpj numbers adjustment

Loops-per-jiffies is a special number which represents a number of
noop-loop cycles per CPU-scheduler quantum - jiffies. As you
understand aside from CPU-specific implementation it depends on
the CPU frequency. So when a platform has the CPU frequency fixed,
we have no problem and the current udelay interface will work
just fine. But as soon as CPU-freq driver is enabled and the cores
frequency changes, we'll end up with distorted udelay's. In order
to fix this we have to accordinly adjust the per-CPU udelay_val
(the same as the global loops_per_jiffy) number. This can be done
in the CPU-freq transition event handler. We subscribe to that event
in the MIPS arch time-inititalization method.
