staging: wfx: add support for hardware revision 2 and further

Currently, the driver explicitly exclude support for chip with version
number it does not know. However, it unlikely that any futur hardware
change would break the driver. Therefore, we prefer to invert the test
and only exclude the versions we know the driver does not support.
