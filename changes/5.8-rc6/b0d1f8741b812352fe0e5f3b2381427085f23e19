iommu/vt-d: Add nested translation helper function

Nested translation mode is supported in VT-d 3.0 Spec.CH 3.8.
With PASID granular translation type set to 0x11b, translation
result from the first level(FL) also subject to a second level(SL)
page table translation. This mode is used for SVA virtualization,
where FL performs guest virtual to guest physical translation and
SL performs guest physical to host physical translation.

This patch adds a helper function for setting up nested translation
where second level comes from a domain and first level comes from
a guest PGD.
