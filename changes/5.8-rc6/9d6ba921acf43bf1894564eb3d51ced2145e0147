soc: qcom: cmd-db: Cast sizeof() to int to silence field width warning

We pass the result of sizeof() here to tell the printk format specifier
how many bytes to print. That expects an int though and sizeof() isn't
that type. Cast to int to silence this warning:

drivers/soc/qcom/cmd-db.c: In function 'cmd_db_debugfs_dump':
drivers/soc/qcom/cmd-db.c:281:30: warning: field width specifier '*' expects argument of type 'int', but argument 4 has type 'long unsigned int' [-Wformat=]
