powerpc/vas: Add VAS user space API

On power9, userspace can send GZIP compression requests directly to NX
once kernel establishes NX channel / window with VAS. This patch provides
user space API which allows user space to establish channel using open
VAS_TX_WIN_OPEN ioctl, mmap and close operations.

Each window corresponds to file descriptor and application can open
multiple windows. After the window is opened, VAS_TX_WIN_OPEN icoctl to
open a window on specific VAS instance, mmap() system call to map
the hardware address of engine's request queue into the application's
virtual address space.

Then the application can then submit one or more requests to the the
engine by using the copy/paste instructions and pasting the CRBs to
the virtual address (aka paste_address) returned by mmap().

Only NX GZIP coprocessor type is supported right now and allow GZIP
engine access via /dev/crypto/nx-gzip device node.

Thanks to Michael Ellerman for his changes and suggestions to make the
ioctl generic to support any coprocessor type.
