net/mlx5e: Update UDP fields of the SKB for GSO first

mlx5e_udp_gso_handle_tx_skb updates the length field in the UDP header
in case of GSO. It doesn't interfere with other offloads, so do it first
to simplify further restructuring of the code. This way we'll make all
independent modifications to the SKB before starting to work with WQEs.
