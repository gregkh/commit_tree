powerpc/64s/exceptions: Change irq reconcile for NMIs from reusing _DAR to RESULT

A spare interrupt stack slot is needed to save irq state when
reconciling NMIs (sreset and decrementer soft-nmi). _DAR is used
for this, but we want to reconcile machine checks as well, which
do use _DAR. Switch to using RESULT instead, as it's used by
system calls.
