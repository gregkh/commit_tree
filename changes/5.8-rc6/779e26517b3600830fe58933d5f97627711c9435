ext4: clean up GET_BLOCKS_PRE_IO error handling

If the call to ext4_split_convert_extents() fails in the
EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_PRE_IO case within ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(),
error out through the exit point at function end rather than jumping
through an intermediate point.  Fix the error handling in the event
ext4_split_convert_extents() returns 0, which it shouldn't do when
splitting an existing extent.  The current code returns the passed in
value of allocated (which is likely non-zero) while failing to set
m_flags, m_pblk, and m_len.
