irqchip: RISC-V per-HART local interrupt controller driver

The RISC-V per-HART local interrupt controller manages software
interrupts, timer interrupts, external interrupts (which are routed
via the platform level interrupt controller) and other per-HART
local interrupts.

We add a driver for the RISC-V local interrupt controller, which
eventually replaces the RISC-V architecture code, allowing for a
better split between arch code and drivers.

The driver is compliant with RISC-V Hart-Level Interrupt Controller
