docs: mm/gup: pin_user_pages.rst: add a "case 5"

Patch series "vhost, docs: convert to pin_user_pages(), new "case 5""

It recently became clear to me that there are some get_user_pages*()
callers that don't fit neatly into any of the four cases that are so far
listed in pin_user_pages.rst.  vhost.c is one of those.

Add a Case 5 to the documentation, and refer to that when converting
vhost.c.

Thanks to Jan Kara for helping me (again) in understanding the
interaction between get_user_pages() and page writeback [1].

This is based on today's mmotm, which has a nearby patch to
pin_user_pages.rst that rewords cases 3 and 4.

Note that I have only compile-tested the vhost.c patch, although that
does also include cross-compiling for a few other arches.  Any run-time
testing would be greatly appreciated.

This patch (of 2):

There are four cases listed in pin_user_pages.rst.  These are intended
to help developers figure out whether to use get_user_pages*(), or
pin_user_pages*().  However, the four cases do not cover all the
situations.  For example, drivers/vhost/vhost.c has a "pin, write to
page, set page dirty, unpin" case.

Add a fifth case, to help explain that there is a general pattern that
requires pin_user_pages*() API calls.
