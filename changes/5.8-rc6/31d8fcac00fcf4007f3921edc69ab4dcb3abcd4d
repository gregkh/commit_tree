mm: workingset: age nonresident information alongside anonymous pages

Patch series "fix for "mm: balance LRU lists based on relative
thrashing" patchset"

This patchset fixes some problems of the patchset, "mm: balance LRU
lists based on relative thrashing", which is now merged on the mainline.

Patch "mm: workingset: let cache workingset challenge anon fix" is the
result of discussion with Johannes.  See following link.

  http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200520232525.798933-6-hannes@cmpxchg.org

And, the other two are minor things which are found when I try to rebase
my patchset.

This patch (of 3):

After ("mm: workingset: let cache workingset challenge anon fix"), we
compare refault distances to active_file + anon.  But age of the
non-resident information is only driven by the file LRU.  As a result,
we may overestimate the recency of any incoming refaults and activate
them too eagerly, causing unnecessary LRU churn in certain situations.

Make anon aging drive nonresident age as well to address that.
