net_sched: sch_fq: change fq_flow size/layout

sizeof(struct fq_flow) is 112 bytes on 64bit arches.

This means that half of them use two cache lines, but 50% use
three cache lines.

This patch adds cache line alignment, and makes sure that only
the first cache line is touched by fq_enqueue(), which is more
expensive that fq_dequeue() in general.
