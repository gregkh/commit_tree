soc: qcom: cmd-db: Properly endian swap the slv_id for debugfs

Read the slv_id properly by making sure the 16-bit number is endian
swapped from little endian to CPU native before we read it to figure out
what to print for the human readable name. Otherwise we may just show
that all the elements in the cmd-db are "Unknown" which isn't right.
