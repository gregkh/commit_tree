KVM: nSVM: move map argument out of enter_svm_guest_mode

Unmapping the nested VMCB in enter_svm_guest_mode is a bit of a wart,
since the map argument is not used elsewhere in the function.  There are
just two callers, and those are also the place where kvm_vcpu_map is
called, so it is cleaner to unmap there.
