ASoC: fsl_asrc_dma: Fix data copying speed issue with EDMA

With EDMA, there is two dma channels can be used for dev_to_dev,
one is from ASRC, one is from another peripheral (ESAI or SAI).

If we select the dma channel of ASRC, there is an issue for ideal
ratio case, the speed of copy data is faster than sample
frequency, because ASRC output data is very fast in ideal ratio
mode.

So it is reasonable to use the dma channel of Back-End peripheral.
then copying speed of DMA is controlled by data consumption
speed in the peripheral FIFO,
