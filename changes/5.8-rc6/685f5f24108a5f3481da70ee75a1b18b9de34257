usb: musb: jz4740: Prevent lockup when CONFIG_SMP is set

The function dma_controller_irq() locks up the exact same spinlock we
locked before calling it, which obviously resulted in a deadlock when
CONFIG_SMP was enabled. This flew under the radar as none of the boards
supported by this driver needs SMP.
