iommu/vt-d: Enlightened PASID allocation

Enabling IOMMU in a guest requires communication with the host
driver for certain aspects. Use of PASID ID to enable Shared Virtual
Addressing (SVA) requires managing PASID's in the host. VT-d 3.0 spec
provides a Virtual Command Register (VCMD) to facilitate this.
Writes to this register in the guest are trapped by vIOMMU which
proxies the call to the host driver.

This virtual command interface consists of a capability register,
a virtual command register, and a virtual response register. Refer
to section 10.4.42, 10.4.43, 10.4.44 for more information.

This patch adds the enlightened PASID allocation/free interfaces
via the virtual command interface.
