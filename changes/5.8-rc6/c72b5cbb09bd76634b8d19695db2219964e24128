bpf: Selftests, verifier case for non null pointer check branch taken

When we have pointer type that is known to be non-null and comparing
against zero we only follow the non-null branch. This adds tests to
cover this case for reference tracking. Also add the other case when
comparison against a non-zero value and ensure we still fail with
unreleased reference.
