ALSA: fireface: add support for RME Fireface UFX (untested)

Fireface UFX was shipped by RME GmbH in 2010, and now discontinued.
Although this model has some enhanced feature which Fireface 802
doesn't have (e.g. on-board USB mass storage device class, configuration
interface with color display), the functionality relevant to
packet communication on IEEE 1394 bus seems to be the same as
Fireface 802 (e.g. available number of channels for PCM frame in
each sampling transfer frequency).

With the assumption, this commit adds support for Fireface UFX. In ALSA
fireface driver, these two models are handled as the same one.
