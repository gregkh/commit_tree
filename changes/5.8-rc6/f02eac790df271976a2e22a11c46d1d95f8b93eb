media: imx: csi: Lookup upstream endpoint with imx_media_get_pad_fwnode

Fix the 1:1 port-id:pad-index assumption for the upstream subdevice, by
searching the upstream subdevice's endpoints for one that maps to the
pad's index. This is carried out by a new reverse mapping function
imx_media_get_pad_fwnode().
