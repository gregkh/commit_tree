arm64: hw_breakpoint: Don't invoke overflow handler on uaccess watchpoints

Unprivileged memory accesses generated by the so-called "translated"
instructions (e.g. STTR) at EL1 can cause EL0 watchpoints to fire
unexpectedly if kernel debugging is enabled. In such cases, the
hw_breakpoint logic will invoke the user overflow handler which will
typically raise a SIGTRAP back to the current task. This is futile when
returning back to the kernel because (a) the signal won't have been
delivered and (b) userspace can't handle the thing anyway.

Avoid invoking the user overflow handler for watchpoints triggered by
kernel uaccess routines, and instead single-step over the faulting
instruction as we would if no overflow handler had been installed.

(Fixes tag identifies the introduction of unprivileged memory accesses,
 which exposed this latent bug in the hw_breakpoint code)
