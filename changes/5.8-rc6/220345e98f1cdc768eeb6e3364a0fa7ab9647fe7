ALSA: usb-audio: Fix OOB access of mixer element list

The USB-audio mixer code holds a linked list of usb_mixer_elem_list,
and several operations are performed for each mixer element.  A few of
them (snd_usb_mixer_notify_id() and snd_usb_mixer_interrupt_v2())
assume each mixer element being a usb_mixer_elem_info object that is a
subclass of usb_mixer_elem_list, cast via container_of() and access it
members.  This may result in an out-of-bound access when a
non-standard list element has been added, as spotted by syzkaller
recently.

This patch adds a new field, is_std_info, in usb_mixer_elem_list to
indicate that the element is the usb_mixer_elem_info type or not, and
skip the access to such an element if needed.
