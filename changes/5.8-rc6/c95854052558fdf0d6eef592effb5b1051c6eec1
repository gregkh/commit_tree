dt-bindings: clock: tegra: Remove PMC clock IDs

clk_out_1, clk_out_2, clk_out_3, blink are part of Tegra PMC block so
these clocks should be provided by the Tegra PMC. IDs for these clocks
have been defined in dt-bindings/soc/tegra-pmc.h.

This patch removes the IDs for these clocks from the Tegra clock device
tree bindings.
