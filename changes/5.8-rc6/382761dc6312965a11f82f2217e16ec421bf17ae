dm: use bio_uninit instead of bio_disassociate_blkg

bio_uninit is the proper API to clean up a BIO that has been allocated
on stack or inside a structure that doesn't come from the BIO allocator.
Switch dm to use that instead of bio_disassociate_blkg, which really is
an implementation detail.  Note that the bio_uninit calls are also moved
to the two callers of __send_empty_flush, so that they better pair with
the bio_init calls used to initialize them.
