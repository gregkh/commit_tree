powerpc: Use a datatype for instructions

Currently unsigned ints are used to represent instructions on powerpc.
This has worked well as instructions have always been 4 byte words.

However, ISA v3.1 introduces some changes to instructions that mean
this scheme will no longer work as well. This change is Prefixed
Instructions. A prefixed instruction is made up of a word prefix
followed by a word suffix to make an 8 byte double word instruction.
No matter the endianness of the system the prefix always comes first.
Prefixed instructions are only planned for powerpc64.

Introduce a ppc_inst type to represent both prefixed and word
instructions on powerpc64 while keeping it possible to exclusively
have word instructions on powerpc32.
