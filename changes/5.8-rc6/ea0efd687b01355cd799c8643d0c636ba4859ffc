usb: renesas_usbhs: getting residue from callback_result

This driver assumed that dmaengine_tx_status() could return
the residue even if the transfer was completed. However,
this was not correct usage [1] and this caused to break getting
the residue after the commit 24461d9792c2 ("dmaengine:
virt-dma: Fix access after free in vchan_complete()") actually.
So, this is possible to get wrong received size if the usb
controller gets a short packet. For example, g_zero driver
causes "bad OUT byte" errors.

The usb-dmac driver will support the callback_result, so this
driver can use it to get residue correctly. Note that even if
the usb-dmac driver has not supported the callback_result yet,
this patch doesn't cause any side-effects.
