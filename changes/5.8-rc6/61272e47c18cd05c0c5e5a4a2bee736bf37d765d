drm/dp_mst: Don't drop NAKs for down responses

It looks like that when we introduced the ability to handle multiple
down requests at once, we accidentally started dropping NAK replies -
causing sideband messages which got NAK'd to seemingly timeout and cause
all sorts of weirdness.

So, fix this by making sure we don't return from
drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() early, but instead treat NAKs like any
other message.
