block: provide a blk_rq_map_sg variant that returns the last element

To be able to move some of the special purpose hacks in blk_rq_map_sg
into the callers we need a variant that returns the last mapped
S/G list element to the caller.  Add that variant as __blk_rq_map_sg
and make blk_rq_map_sg a trivial inline wrapper around it.
