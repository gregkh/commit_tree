exec: Remove BUG_ON(has_group_leader_pid)

With the introduction of exchange_tids thread_group_leader and
has_group_leader_pid have become equivalent.  Further at this point in the
code a thread group has exactly two threads, the previous thread_group_leader
that is waiting to be reaped and tsk.  So we know it is impossible for tsk to
be the thread_group_leader.

This is also the last user of has_group_leader_pid so removing this check
will allow has_group_leader_pid to be removed.

So remove the "BUG_ON(has_group_leader_pid)" that will never fire.
