loop: Fix wrong masking of status flags

In faf1d25440d6, loop_set_status() now assigns lo_status directly from
the passed in lo_flags, but then fixes it up by masking out flags that
can't be set by LOOP_SET_STATUS; unfortunately the mask was negated.

Re-ran all ltp ioctl_loop tests, and they all passed.

Pass run of the previously failing one:
