media: staging: rkisp1: remove TODO item - uapi structs compatibility

remove the TODO item:

* Make sure uapi structs have the same size and layout in 32 and 62 bits,
and that there are no holes in the structures (pahole is a utility that
can be used to test this).

It was tested with pahole and found compatible.
