afs: Fix use of BUG()

Fix afs_compare_addrs() to use WARN_ON(1) instead of BUG() and return 1
(ie. srx_a > srx_b).

There's no point trying to put actual error handling in as this should not
occur unless a new transport address type is allowed by AFS.  And even if
it does, in this particular case, it'll just never match unknown types of
addresses.  This BUG() was more of a 'you need to add a case here'
indicator.
