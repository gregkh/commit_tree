bus: vexpress-config: simplify config bus probing

The vexpress-config initialization is dependent on the vexpress-syscfg
driver probing. As vexpress-config was not a driver, deferred probe
could not be used and instead initcall ordering was relied upon. This is
fragile and doesn't work for modules.

Let's move the config bus init into the vexpress-syscfg probe. This
eliminates the initcall ordering requirement and the need to create a
struct device and the "vexpress-config" class.
