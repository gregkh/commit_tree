powerpc: Define new SRR1 bits for a ISA v3.1

Add the BOUNDARY SRR1 bit definition for when the cause of an
alignment exception is a prefixed instruction that crosses a 64-byte
boundary. Add the PREFIXED SRR1 bit definition for exceptions caused
by prefixed instructions.

Bit 35 of SRR1 is called SRR1_ISI_N_OR_G. This name comes from it
being used to indicate that an ISI was due to the access being no-exec
or guarded. ISA v3.1 adds another purpose. It is also set if there is
an access in a cache-inhibited location for prefixed instruction.
Rename from SRR1_ISI_N_OR_G to SRR1_ISI_N_G_OR_CIP.
