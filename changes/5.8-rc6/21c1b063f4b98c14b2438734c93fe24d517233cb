ath11k: add pktlog checksum in trace events to support pktlog

Pktlog data are different among the chipset & chipset versions.
As part of enhancing the user space script to decode the pktlog
trace events generated, it is desirable to know which chipset or
which chipset version has provided the events and thereby decode
the pktlogs appropriately.

Pktlog checksum helps to determine the chipset variant which is
given by the firmware in the struct wmi_ready_event.

Pktlog checksums are computed during the firmware build.
So, adding that pktlog checksum in the pklog trace events.
