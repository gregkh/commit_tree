driver core: Look for waiting consumers only for a fwnode's primary device

Commit 4dbe191c046e ("driver core: Add device links from fwnode only for
the primary device") skipped linking a fwnode's secondary device to
the suppliers listed in its fwnode.

However, a fwnode's secondary device can't be found using
get_dev_from_fwnode(). So, there's no point in trying to see if devices
waiting for suppliers might want to link to a fwnode's secondary device.

This commit removes that unnecessary step for devices that aren't a
fwnode's primary device and also moves the code to a more appropriate
part of the file.
