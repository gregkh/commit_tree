Bluetooth: btbcm: Drop upper nibble version check from btbcm_initialize()

btbcm_initialize() must either return an error; or fill the passed in
fw_name, otherwise we end up passing uninitialized stack memory to
request_firmware().

Since we have a fallback hw_name of "BCM" not having a known version
in the subver field does not matter, drop the check so that we always
fill the passed in fw_name.
