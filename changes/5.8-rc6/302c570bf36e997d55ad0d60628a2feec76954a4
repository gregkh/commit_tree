usb: typec: tcpci_rt1711h: avoid screaming irq causing boot hangs

John reported screaming irq caused by rt1711h when system boot[1],
this is because irq request is done before tcpci_register_port(),
so the chip->tcpci has not been setup, irq handler is entered but
can't do anything, this patch is to address this by moving the irq
request after tcpci_register_port().
