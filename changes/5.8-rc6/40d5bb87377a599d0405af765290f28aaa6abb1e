HID: multitouch: enable multi-input as a quirk for some devices

Two touchpad/trackstick combos are currently not behaving properly.
They define a mouse emulation collection, as per Win8 requirements,
but also define a separate mouse collection for the trackstick.

The way the kernel currently treat the collections is that it
merges both in one device. However, given that the first mouse
collection already defines X,Y and left, right buttons, when
mapping the events from the second mouse collection, hid-multitouch
sees that these events are already mapped, and simply ignores them.

To be able to report events from the tracktick, add a new quirked
class for it, and manually add the 2 devices we know about.
