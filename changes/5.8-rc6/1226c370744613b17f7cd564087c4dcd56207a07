iommu/amd: Let free_pagetable() not rely on domain->pt_root

Use 'struct domain_pgtable' instead to free_pagetable(). This solves
the problem that amd_iommu_domain_direct_map() needs to restore
domain->pt_root after the device table has been updated just to make
free_pagetable release the domain page-table.
