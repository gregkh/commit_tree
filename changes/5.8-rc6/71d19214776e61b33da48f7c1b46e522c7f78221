bpf: add bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns()

On a device like a cellphone which is constantly suspending
and resuming CLOCK_MONOTONIC is not particularly useful for
keeping track of or reacting to external network events.
Instead you want to use CLOCK_BOOTTIME.

Hence add bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns() as a mirror of bpf_ktime_get_ns()
based around CLOCK_BOOTTIME instead of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
