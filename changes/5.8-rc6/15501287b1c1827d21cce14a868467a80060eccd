drm/i915/execlists: Drop request-before-CS assertion

When we migrated to execlists, one of the conditions we wanted to test
for was whether the breadcrumb seqno was being written before the
breadcumb interrupt was delivered. This was following on from issues
observed on previous generations which were not so strongly ordered. With
the removal of the missed interrupt detection, we have not reliable
means of detecting the out-of-order seqno/interrupt but instead tried to
assert that the relationship between the CS event interrupt and the
breadwrite should be strongly ordered. However, Icelake proves it is
possible for the HW implementation to forget about minor little details
such as write ordering and so the order between *processing* the CS
event and the breadcrumb is unreliable.

Remove the unreliable assertion, but leave a debug telltale in case we
have reason to suspect.
