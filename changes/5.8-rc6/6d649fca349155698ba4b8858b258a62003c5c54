pinctrl: intel: Move npins closer to pin_base in struct intel_community

It's common across the drivers to use the (pin_base, npins) pair to describe
community characteristics. Thus, move them in the struct intel_community
to be closer to each other.

While at it, add a blank line to cut driver usable fields from what core
reserves for itself.
