modpost: use read_text_file() and get_line() for reading text files

grab_file() mmaps a file, but it is not so efficient here because
get_next_line() copies every line to the temporary buffer anyway.

read_text_file() and get_line() are simpler. get_line() exploits the
library function strchr().

Going forward, the missing *.symvers or *.cmd is a fatal error.
This should not happen because scripts/Makefile.modpost guards the
-i option files with $(wildcard $(input-symdump)).
