net: dsa: sja1105: fix port mirroring for P/Q/R/S

The dynamic configuration interface for the General Params and the L2
Lookup Params tables was copy-pasted between E/T devices and P/Q/R/S
devices. Nonetheless, these interfaces are bitwise different.

The driver is using dynamic reconfiguration of the General Parameters
table for the port mirroring feature, which was therefore broken on
P/Q/R/S.

Note that this patch can't be backported easily very far to stable trees
(since it conflicts with some other development done since the
introduction of the driver). So the Fixes: tag is purely informational.
