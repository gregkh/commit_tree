READ_ONCE: Simplify implementations of {READ,WRITE}_ONCE()

The implementations of {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() suffer from a significant
amount of indirection and complexity due to a historic GCC bug:

https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58145

which was originally worked around by 230fa253df63 ("kernel: Provide
READ_ONCE and ASSIGN_ONCE").

Since GCC 4.8 is fairly vintage at this point and we emit a warning if
we detect it during the build, return {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to their former
glory with an implementation that is easier to understand and, crucially,
more amenable to optimisation. A side effect of this simplification is
that WRITE_ONCE() no longer returns a value, but nobody seems to be
relying on that and the new behaviour is aligned with smp_store_release().
