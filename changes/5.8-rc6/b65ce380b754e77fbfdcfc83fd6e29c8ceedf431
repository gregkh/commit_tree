genetlink: clean up family attributes allocations

genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse() and genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_free()
take a boolean parameter to determine whether allocate/free the family
attrs. This is unnecessary as we can just check family->parallel_ops.
More importantly, callers would not need to worry about pairing these
parameters correctly after this patch.

And this fixes a memory leak, as after commit c36f05559104
("genetlink: fix memory leaks in genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit()")
we call genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse() for both parallel and
non-parallel cases.
