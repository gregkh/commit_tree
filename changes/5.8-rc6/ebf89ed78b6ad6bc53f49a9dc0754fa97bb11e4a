ARM: dts: dra7: Fix timer nodes properly for timer_sys_ck clocks

The commit 5390130f3b28 ("ARM: dts: dra7: add timer_sys_ck entries
for IPU/DSP timers") was added to allow the OMAP clocksource timer
driver to use the clock aliases when reconfiguring the parent clock
source for the timer functional clocks after the timer_sys_ck clock
aliases got cleaned up in commit a8202cd5174d ("clk: ti: dra7: drop
unnecessary clock aliases").

The above patch however has missed adding the entries for couple of
timers (14, 15 and 16), and also added erroneously in the parent
ti-sysc nodes for couple of clocks (timers 4, 5 and 6). Fix these
properly, so that any of these timers can be used with OMAP remoteproc
IPU and DSP devices. The always-on timers 1 and 12 are not expected
to use this clock source, so they are not modified.
