drm/i915: Streamline the artihmetic

All these ROUNDING_FACTORs and whatnot are making this thing hard to
read. Get rid of them. And let's massage some of the fractions to
give us less questionable intermediate results and perhaps less
divisions.

Also looks like a good helping of 64bit math stuff is needed to
avoid some of overflows present in the current code. There
might still be a few overflows, namely when calculating
link_clks_available/samples_room (would require a huge hblank
though), and potentially when calculating hblank_rise (not sure
how large link_clks_active can get).

It looks like we're still not calculating exactly what the spec says
since we truncate tu_data and tu_line early. But I'm too lazy to
figure out if we could avoid that.

    Remove ROUNDING_FACTOR define (Uma)
    s/5*link_clk+5*cdclk/5*(link_clk+cdclk)/ (Chris)
