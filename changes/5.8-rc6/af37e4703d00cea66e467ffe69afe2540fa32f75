iio: adc: ad7476: Generate CONVST signal internally

Compared to the other supported parts, AD7091R are dependent of
a CONVST signal that initiates the conversion. At this moment, only
sampling in buffered mode is supported for AD7091R and the only
option until now was to generate this signal externally using an
IIO trigger. This patch adds the option of generating it internally,
more compatible triggers being available in this case.

Also, it is an intermediate step of adding support more devices.
