mtd: rawnand: pasemi: Fix the probe error path

nand_cleanup() is supposed to be called on error after a successful
call to nand_scan() to free all NAND resources.

There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
in this driver predates by far the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
which makes this change possible, hence pointing it as the commit to
fix for backporting purposes, even if this commit is not introducing
any bug.
