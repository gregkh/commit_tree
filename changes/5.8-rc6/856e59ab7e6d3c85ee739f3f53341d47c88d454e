net: ethernet: ti: cpts: switch to use new .gettimex64() interface

The CPTS HW latches and saves CPTS counter value in CPTS fifo immediately
after writing to CPSW_CPTS_PUSH.TS_PUSH (bit 0), so the total time that the
driver needs to read the CPTS timestamp is the time required CPSW_CPTS_PUSH
write to actually reach HW.

Hence switch CPTS driver to implement new .gettimex64() callback for more
precise measurement of the offset between a PHC and the system clock which
is measured as time between
  write(CPSW_CPTS_PUSH)
  read(CPSW_CPTS_PUSH)
