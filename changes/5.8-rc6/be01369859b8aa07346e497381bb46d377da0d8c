esp, ah: modernize the crypto algorithm selections

The crypto algorithms selected by the ESP and AH kconfig options are
out-of-date with the guidance of RFC 8221, which lists the legacy
algorithms MD5 and DES as "MUST NOT" be implemented, and some more
modern algorithms like AES-GCM and HMAC-SHA256 as "MUST" be implemented.
But the options select the legacy algorithms, not the modern ones.

Therefore, modify these options to select the MUST algorithms --
and *only* the MUST algorithms.

Also improve the help text.

Note that other algorithms may still be explicitly enabled in the
kconfig, and the choice of which to actually use is still controlled by
userspace.  This change only modifies the list of algorithms for which
kernel support is guaranteed to be present.
