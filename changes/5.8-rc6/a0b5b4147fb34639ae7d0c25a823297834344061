mm: memcontrol: update page->mem_cgroup stability rules

The previous patches have simplified the access rules around
page->mem_cgroup somewhat:

1. We never change page->mem_cgroup while the page is isolated by
   somebody else.  This was by far the biggest exception to our rules and
   it didn't stop at lock_page() or lock_page_memcg().

2. We charge pages before they get put into page tables now, so the
   somewhat fishy rule about "can be in page table as long as it's still
   locked" is now gone and boiled down to having an exclusive reference to
   the page.

Document the new rules.  Any of the following will stabilize the
page->mem_cgroup association:

- the page lock
- LRU isolation
- lock_page_memcg()
- exclusive access to the page
