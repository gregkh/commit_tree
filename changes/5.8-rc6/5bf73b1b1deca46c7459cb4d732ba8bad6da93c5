ASoC: intel/skl/hda - fix oops on systems without i915 audio codec

Recent fix for jack detection caused a regression on systems with HDA
audio codec but no HDMI/DP audio via i915 graphics, leading to a kernel
oops at device probe. On these systems, HDA bus instance lookup fails,
as the first ASoC runtime of the card is connected to a dummy codec
(as no HDMI codec is present).
