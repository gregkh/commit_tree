drivers: Remove inclusion of vermagic header

Get rid of linux/vermagic.h includes, so that MODULE_ARCH_VERMAGIC from
the arch header arch/x86/include/asm/module.h won't be redefined.

  In file included from ./include/linux/module.h:30,
                   from drivers/net/ethernet/3com/3c515.c:56:
  ./arch/x86/include/asm/module.h:73: warning: "MODULE_ARCH_VERMAGIC"
redefined
     73 | # define MODULE_ARCH_VERMAGIC MODULE_PROC_FAMILY
        |
  In file included from drivers/net/ethernet/3com/3c515.c:25:
  ./include/linux/vermagic.h:28: note: this is the location of the
previous definition
     28 | #define MODULE_ARCH_VERMAGIC ""
        |
