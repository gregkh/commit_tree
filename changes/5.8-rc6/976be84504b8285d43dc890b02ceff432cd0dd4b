perf evlist: Allow reusing the side band thread for more purposes

I.e. so far we had just one event in that side band thread, a dummy one
with attr.bpf_event set, so that 'perf record' can go ahead and ask the
kernel for further information about BPF programs being loaded.

Allow for more than one event to be there, so that we can use it as
well for the upcoming --switch-output-event feature.
