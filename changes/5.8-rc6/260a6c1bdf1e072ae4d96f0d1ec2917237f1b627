drm/i915: Fix glk watermark calculations

GLK wants the +1 adjustement for the "blocks per line" value
for x-tile/y-tile, just like cnl+.

Also the x-tile and linear cases are almost identical. The only
difference is this +1 which is always done for glk+, and only
done for linear on skl/bxt. Let's unify it to a single branch
with a special case for the +1, just like we do for y-tile.
