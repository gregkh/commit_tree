pinctrl: amd: fix npins for uart0 in kerncz_groups

uart0_pins is defined as:
static const unsigned uart0_pins[] = {135, 136, 137, 138, 139};

which npins is wronly specified as 9 later
	{
		.name = "uart0",
		.pins = uart0_pins,
		.npins = 9,
	},

npins should be 5 instead of 9 according to the definition.
