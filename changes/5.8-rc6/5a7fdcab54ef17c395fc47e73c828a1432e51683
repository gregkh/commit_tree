powerpc/xmon: Use bitwise calculations in_breakpoint_table()

A modulo operation is used for calculating the current offset from a
breakpoint within the breakpoint table. As instruction lengths are
always a power of 2, this can be replaced with a bitwise 'and'. The
current check for word alignment can be replaced with checking that the
lower 2 bits are not set.
