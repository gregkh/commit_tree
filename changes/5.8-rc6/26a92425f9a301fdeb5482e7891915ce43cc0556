efi/x86: Remove __efistub_global and add relocation check

Instead of using __efistub_global to force variables into the .data
section, leave them in the .bss but pull the EFI stub's .bss section
into .data in the linker script for the compressed kernel.

Add relocation checking for x86 as well to catch non-PC-relative
relocations that require runtime processing, since the EFI stub does not
do any runtime relocation processing.

This will catch, for example, data relocations created by static
initializers of pointers.
