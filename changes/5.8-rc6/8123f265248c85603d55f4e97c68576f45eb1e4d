KVM: x86/mmu: Add a helper to consolidate root sp allocation

Add a helper, mmu_alloc_root(), to consolidate the allocation of a root
shadow page, which has the same basic mechanics for all flavors of TDP
and shadow paging.

Note, __pa(sp->spt) doesn't need to be protected by mmu_lock, sp->spt
points at a kernel page.

No functional change intended.
