s390/bpf: Maintain 8-byte stack alignment

Certain kernel functions (e.g. get_vtimer/set_vtimer) cause kernel
panic when the stack is not 8-byte aligned. Currently JITed BPF programs
may trigger this by allocating stack frames with non-rounded sizes and
then being interrupted. Fix by using rounded fp->aux->stack_depth.
