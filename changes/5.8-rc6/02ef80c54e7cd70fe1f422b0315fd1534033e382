drm/msm/a6xx: update pdc/rscc GMU registers for A640/A650

Update the gmu_pdc registers for A640 and A650.

Some of the RSCC registers on A650 are in a separate region.

Note this also changes the address of these registers:

RSCC_TCS1_DRV0_STATUS
RSCC_TCS2_DRV0_STATUS
RSCC_TCS3_DRV0_STATUS

Based on the values in msm-4.14 and msm-4.19 kernels.

v3: replaced adreno_is_a650 around ->rscc with checks for "rscc" resource
