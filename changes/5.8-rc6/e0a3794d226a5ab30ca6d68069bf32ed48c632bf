same with CL#1711022(correcting yuv420 black color in function dcn10_blank_pixel_data,program_scaler),
yuv420 black color also needs to be correct when enabling HDMI stream at the resume procedure.

[How]
correcting the yuv420 black color according to the way how 420 is packed :2 channels carry Y component,
1 channel alternate between Cb and Cr.
