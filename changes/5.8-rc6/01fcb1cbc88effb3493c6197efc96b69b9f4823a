vhost: allow device that does not depend on vhost worker

vDPA device currently relays the eventfd via vhost worker. This is
inefficient due the latency of wakeup and scheduling, so this patch
tries to introduce a use_worker attribute for the vhost device. When
use_worker is not set with vhost_dev_init(), vhost won't try to
allocate a worker thread and the vhost_poll will be processed directly
in the wakeup function.

This help for vDPA since it reduces the latency caused by vhost worker.

In my testing, it saves 0.2 ms in pings between VMs on a mutual host.
