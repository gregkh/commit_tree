selftests/bpf: Ensure test flavors use correct skeletons

Ensure that test runner flavors include their own skeletons from <flavor>/
directory. Previously, skeletons generated for no-flavor test_progs were used.
Apart from fixing correctness, this also makes it possible to compile only
flavors individually:

  $ make clean && make test_progs-no_alu32
  ... now succeeds ...
