i2c: designware: Use `-y` to build multi-object modules

Since commit 4f8272802739 ("Documentation: update kbuild loadable modules
goals & examples") `-objs` is fitted for building host programs, lets
change DW I2C core, platform and PCI driver kbuild directives to using
`-y`, which more straightforward for device drivers. By doing so we can
discard the ifeq construction in favor to the more natural and less bulky
`<module>-$(CONFIG_X) += x.o`
