net/smc: allocate index for a new link

Add smc_llc_alloc_alt_link() to find a free link index for a new link,
depending on the new link group type. And update constants for the
maximum number of links to 3 (2 symmetric and 1 dangling asymmetric link).
These maximum numbers are the same as used by other implementations of the
SMC-R protocol.
