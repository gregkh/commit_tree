ASoC: codecs: wm97xx: fix ac97 dependency

A recent build fix got the dependency slightly wrong, breaking
builds with CONFIG_AC97_BUS_NEW:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_WM9713
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_AC97_BUS [=n]
  Selected by [m]:
  - SND_SOC_ZYLONITE [=m] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_PXA2XX_SOC [=m] && MACH_ZYLONITE [=y] && AC97_BUS [=n]=n

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_WM9712
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_AC97_BUS [=n]
  Selected by [m]:
  - SND_PXA2XX_SOC_EM_X270 [=m] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_PXA2XX_SOC [=m] && (MACH_EM_X270 [=n] || MACH_EXEDA [=n] || MACH_CM_X300 [=y]) && AC97_BUS [=n]=n

Change the dependency to allow either version of the AC97 library
code.
