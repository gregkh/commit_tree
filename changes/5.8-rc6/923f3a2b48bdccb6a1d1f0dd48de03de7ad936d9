x86/resctrl: Query LLC monitoring properties once during boot

Cache and memory bandwidth monitoring are features that are part of
x86 CPU resource control that is supported by the resctrl subsystem.
The monitoring properties are obtained via CPUID from every CPU
and only used within the resctrl subsystem where the properties are
only read from boot_cpu_data.

Obtain the monitoring properties once, placed in boot_cpu_data, via the
->c_bsp_init() helpers of the vendors that support X86_FEATURE_CQM_LLC.
