audit: fix a net reference leak in audit_send_reply()

If audit_send_reply() fails when trying to create a new thread to
send the reply it also fails to cleanup properly, leaking a reference
to a net structure.  This patch fixes the error path and makes a
handful of other cleanups that came up while fixing the code.
