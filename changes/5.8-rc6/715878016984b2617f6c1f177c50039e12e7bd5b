arm64: dts: marvell: armada-37xx: Set pcie_reset_pin to gpio function

We found out that we are unable to control the PERST# signal via the
default pin dedicated to be PERST# pin (GPIO2[3] pin) on A3700 SOC when
this pin is in EP_PCIE1_Resetn mode. There is a register in the PCIe
register space called PERSTN_GPIO_EN (D0088004[3]), but changing the
value of this register does not change the pin output when measuring
with voltmeter.

We do not know if this is a bug in the SOC, or if it works only when
PCIe controller is in a certain state.

Commit f4c7d053d7f7 ("PCI: aardvark: Wait for endpoint to be ready
before training link") says that when this pin changes pinctrl mode
from EP_PCIE1_Resetn to GPIO, the PERST# signal is asserted for a brief
moment.

So currently the situation is that on A3700 boards the PERST# signal is
asserted in U-Boot (because the code in U-Boot issues reset via this pin
via GPIO mode), and then in Linux by the obscure and undocumented
mechanism described by the above mentioned commit.

We want to issue PERST# signal in a known way, therefore this patch
changes the pcie_reset_pin function from "pcie" to "gpio" and adds the
reset-gpios property to the PCIe node in device tree files of
EspressoBin and Armada 3720 Dev Board (Turris Mox device tree already
has this property and uDPU does not have a PCIe port).
