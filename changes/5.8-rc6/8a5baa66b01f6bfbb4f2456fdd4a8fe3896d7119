staging: vt6656: Remove the local variable "array"

Remove the local variable "array" and all the memcpy function calls
because this copy operation from different arrays to this variable is
unnecessary.

The vnt_control_out function already does a kmemdup copy of its const
char *buffer argument and this was made unnecessary by:

    staging: vt6656: use off stack for out buffer USB transfers.

    Since 4.9 mandated USB buffers be heap allocated this causes the driver
    to fail.

    Since there is a wide range of buffer sizes use kmemdup to create
    allocated buffer.

So, the same result can be achieved using the arrays directly.
