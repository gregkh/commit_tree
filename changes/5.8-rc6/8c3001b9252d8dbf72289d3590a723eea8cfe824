arm64: entry: Tidy up block comments and label numbers

Continually butchering our entry code with CPU errata workarounds has
led to it looking a little scruffy. Consistently used /* */ comment
style for multi-line block comments and ensure that small numeric labels
use consecutive integers.

No functional change, but the state of things was irritating.
