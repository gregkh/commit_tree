media: v4l2-ctrls: v4l2_ctrl_g/s_ctrl*(): don't continue when WARN_ON

If the v4l2_ctrl_g_ctrl*() or __v4l2_ctrl_s_ctrl*() functions
are called for the wrong control type then they call WARN_ON
since that is a driver error. But they still continue, potentially
overwriting data. Change this to return an error (s_ctrl) or 0
(g_ctrl), just to be safe.
