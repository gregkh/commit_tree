media: imx: csi: Implement get_fwnode_pad op

The CSI does not have a 1:1 relationship between fwnode port numbers and
pad indexes. In fact the CSI fwnode device is itself a port which is the
sink, containing only a single fwnode endpoint. Implement media_entity
operation get_fwnode_pad to first verify the given endpoint is the CSI's
sink endpoint, and if so return the CSI sink pad index.
