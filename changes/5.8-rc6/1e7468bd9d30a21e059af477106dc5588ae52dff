clk: Specify IOMEM dependency for HSDK pll driver

The HSDK pll driver uses the devm_ioremap_resource function, but does
not specify a dependency on IOMEM in Kconfig. This causes a build
failure on architectures without IOMEM, for example, UML (notably with
make allyesconfig).

Fix this by making CONFIG_CLK_HSDK depend on CONFIG_IOMEM.
