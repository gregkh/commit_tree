xhci: Fix enumeration issue when setting max packet size for FS devices.

Unable to complete the enumeration of a USB TV Tuner device.

Per XHCI spec (4.6.5), the EP state field of the input context shall
be cleared for a set address command. In the special case of an FS
device that has "MaxPacketSize0 = 8", the Linux XHCI driver does
not do this before evaluating the context. With an XHCI controller
that checks the EP state field for parameter context error this
causes a problem in cases such as the device getting reset again
after enumeration.

When that field is cleared, the problem does not occur.

This was found and fixed by Sasi Kumar.
