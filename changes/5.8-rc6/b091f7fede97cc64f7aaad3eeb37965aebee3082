btrfs: use kfree() in btrfs_ioctl_get_subvol_info()

In btrfs_ioctl_get_subvol_info(), there is a classic case where kzalloc()
was incorrectly paired with kzfree(). According to David Sterba, there
isn't any sensitive information in the subvol_info that needs to be
cleared before freeing. So kzfree() isn't really needed, use kfree()
instead.
