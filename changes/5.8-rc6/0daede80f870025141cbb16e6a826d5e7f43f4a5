i2c: designware: Convert driver to using regmap API

Seeing the DW I2C driver is using flags-based accessors with two
conditional clauses it would be better to replace them with the regmap
API IO methods and to initialize the regmap object with read/write
callbacks specific to the controller registers map implementation. This
will be also handy for the drivers with non-standard registers mapping
(like an embedded into the Baikal-T1 System Controller DW I2C block, which
glue-driver is a part of this series).

As before the driver tries to detect the mapping setup at probe stage and
creates a regmap object accordingly, which will be used by the rest of the
code to correctly access the controller registers. In two places it was
appropriate to convert the hand-written read-modify-write and
read-poll-loop design patterns to the corresponding regmap API
ready-to-use methods.

Note the regmap IO methods return value is checked only at the probe
stage. The rest of the code won't do this because basically we have
MMIO-based regmap so non of the read/write methods can fail (this also
won't be needed for the Baikal-T1-specific I2C controller).
