ARM: dts: am5729: beaglebone-ai: fix rgmii phy-mode

Since commit cd28d1d6e52e ("net: phy: at803x: Disable phy delay for
RGMII mode") the networking is broken on the BeagleBone AI which has
the AR8035 PHY for Gigabit Ethernet [0].  The fix is to switch from
phy-mode = "rgmii" to phy-mode = "rgmii-rxid".

Note: Grygorii made a similar DT fix for other AM57xx boards with a
different phy in commit 820f8a870f65 ("ARM: dts: am57xx: fix networking
on boards with ksz9031 phy").
