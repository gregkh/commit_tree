printk: Convert a use of sprintf to snprintf in console_unlock

When CONFIG_PRINTK is disabled (e.g. when building allnoconfig), clang
warns:

../kernel/printk/printk.c:2416:10: warning: 'sprintf' will always
overflow; destination buffer has size 0, but format string expands to at
least 33 [-Wfortify-source]
			len = sprintf(text,
			      ^
1 warning generated.

It is not wrong; text has a zero size when CONFIG_PRINTK is disabled
because LOG_LINE_MAX and PREFIX_MAX are both zero. Change to snprintf so
that this case is explicitly handled without any risk of overflow.
