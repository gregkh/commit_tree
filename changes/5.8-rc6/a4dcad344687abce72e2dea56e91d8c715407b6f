net: ipa: remove endpoint delay mode feature

A "delay mode" feature was put in place to work around a problem
that was observed during development of the upstream IPA driver.  It
used TX endpoint "delay mode" in order to prevent transmitting
packets toward the modem before it was ready.

A race condition that would explain the problem has long since been
fixed, and we have concluded that the "delay mode" feature is no
longer required.  So get rid of it.
