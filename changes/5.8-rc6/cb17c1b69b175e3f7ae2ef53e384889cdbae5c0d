scsi: hpsa: Don't bother with vmalloc for BIG_IOCTL_Command_struct

"BIG" in the name refers to the amount of data being transferred, _not_ the
size of structure itself; it's 140 or 144 bytes (for 32bit and 64bit hosts
resp.).  IOCTL_Command_struct is 136 or 144 bytes large...

No point whatsoever turning that into dynamic allocation, let alone vmalloc
one.  Just keep it as local variable...
