kernel: set USER_DS in kthread_use_mm

Some architectures like arm64 and s390 require USER_DS to be set for
kernel threads to access user address space, which is the whole purpose of
kthread_use_mm, but other like x86 don't.  That has lead to a huge mess
where some callers are fixed up once they are tested on said
architectures, while others linger around and yet other like io_uring try
to do "clever" optimizations for what usually is just a trivial asignment
to a member in the thread_struct for most architectures.

Make kthread_use_mm set USER_DS, and kthread_unuse_mm restore to the
previous value instead.
