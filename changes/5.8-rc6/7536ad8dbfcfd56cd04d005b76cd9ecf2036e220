firmware: fpga: replace the error codes with the standard ones

The Intel service layer driver has defined error codes for the
specific services, which started from FPGA configuration then RSU
(Remote Status Update).

Intel service layer driver should define the standard error codes
rather than keep adding more error codes for the new services.

The standard error codes will be used by all the clients of Intel service
layer driver.

Replace FPGA and RSU specific error codes with Intel service layerâ€™s
Common error codes.
