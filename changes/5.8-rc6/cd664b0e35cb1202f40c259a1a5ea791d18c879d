io_uring: fix hanging iopoll in case of -EAGAIN

io_do_iopoll() won't do anything with a request unless
req->iopoll_completed is set. So io_complete_rw_iopoll() has to set
it, otherwise io_do_iopoll() will poll a file again and again even
though the request of interest was completed long time ago.

Also, remove -EAGAIN check from io_issue_sqe() as it races with
the changed lines. The request will take the long way and be
resubmitted from io_iopoll*().
