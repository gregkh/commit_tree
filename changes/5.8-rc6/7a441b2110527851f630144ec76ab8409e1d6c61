iommu/amd: Use pci_ats_supported()

The pci_ats_supported() function checks if a device supports ATS and is
allowed to use it. In addition to checking that the device has an ATS
capability and that the global pci=noats is not set
(pci_ats_disabled()), it also checks if a device is untrusted.

A device is untrusted if it is plugged into an external-facing port such
as Thunderbolt and could be spoofing an existing device to exploit
weaknesses in the IOMMU configuration. By calling pci_ats_supported() we
keep DTE[I]=0 for untrusted devices and abort transactions with
Pretranslated Addresses.
