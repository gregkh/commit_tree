selftests/x86: Consolidate and fix get/set_eflags() helpers

There are several copies of get_eflags() and set_eflags() and they all are
buggy.  Consolidate them and fix them.  The fixes are:

Add memory clobbers.  These are probably unnecessary but they make sure
that the compiler doesn't move something past one of these calls when it
shouldn't.

Respect the redzone on x86_64.  There has no failure been observed related
to this, but it's definitely a bug.
