exec: Factor security_bprm_creds_for_exec out of security_bprm_set_creds

Today security_bprm_set_creds has several implementations:
apparmor_bprm_set_creds, cap_bprm_set_creds, selinux_bprm_set_creds,
smack_bprm_set_creds, and tomoyo_bprm_set_creds.

Except for cap_bprm_set_creds they all test bprm->called_set_creds and
return immediately if it is true.  The function cap_bprm_set_creds
ignores bprm->calld_sed_creds entirely.

Create a new LSM hook security_bprm_creds_for_exec that is called just
before prepare_binprm in __do_execve_file, resulting in a LSM hook
that is called exactly once for the entire of exec.  Modify the bits
of security_bprm_set_creds that only want to be called once per exec
into security_bprm_creds_for_exec, leaving only cap_bprm_set_creds
behind.

Remove bprm->called_set_creds all of it's former users have been moved
to security_bprm_creds_for_exec.

Add or upate comments a appropriate to bring them up to date and
to reflect this change.
