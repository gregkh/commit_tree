ubsan: entirely disable alignment checks under UBSAN_TRAP

Commit 8d58f222e85f ("ubsan: disable UBSAN_ALIGNMENT under
COMPILE_TEST") tried to fix the pathological results of UBSAN_ALIGNMENT
with UBSAN_TRAP (which objtool would rightly scream about), but it made
an assumption about how COMPILE_TEST gets set (it is not set for
randconfig).  As a result, we need a bigger hammer here: just don't
allow the alignment checks with the trap mode.
