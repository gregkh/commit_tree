x86/mce/amd: Cleanup threshold device remove path

Pass in the bank pointer directly to the cleaning up functions,
obviating the need for per-CPU accesses. Make the clean up path
interrupt-safe by cleaning the bank pointer first so that the rest of
the teardown happens safe from the thresholding interrupt.

No functional changes.

 [ bp: Write commit message and reverse bank->shared test to save an
   indentation level in threshold_remove_bank(). ]
