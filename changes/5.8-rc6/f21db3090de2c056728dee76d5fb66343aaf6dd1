KVM: MIPS: Add Loongson-3 Virtual IPI interrupt support

This patch add Loongson-3 Virtual IPI interrupt support in the kernel.
The current implementation of IPI emulation in QEMU is based on GIC for
MIPS, but Loongson-3 doesn't use GIC. Furthermore, IPI emulation in QEMU
is too expensive for performance (because of too many context switches
between Host and Guest). With current solution, the IPI delay may even
cause RCU stall warnings in a multi-core Guest. So, we design a faster
solution that emulate IPI interrupt in kernel (only used by Loongson-3
now).
