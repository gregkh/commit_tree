staging: wfx: also fix network parameters for IBSS networks

Current code skip some configuration during joining an IBSS network.
Indeed, it seems that this configuration is not used in IBSS. However,
it would be harmless to set them. In add, we would prefer to keep
association processes for ad-hoc and managed networks the closest as
possible. It also ensures the values of internal parameters of the
firmware.

Therefore, apply them unconditionally.
