nvme-pci: align io queue count with allocted nvme_queue in nvme_probe

Since commit 147b27e4bd08 ("nvme-pci: allocate device queues storage
space at probe"), nvme_alloc_queue does not alloc the nvme queues
itself anymore.

If the write/poll_queues module parameters are changed at runtime to
values larger than the number of allocated queues in nvme_probe,
nvme_alloc_queue will access unallocated memory.

Add a new nr_allocated_queues member to struct nvme_dev to record how
many queues were alloctated in nvme_probe to avoid using more than the
allocated queues after a reset following a change to the
write/poll_queues module parameters.

Also add nr_write_queues and nr_poll_queues members to allow refreshing
the number of write and poll queues based on a change to the module
parameters when resetting the controller.
