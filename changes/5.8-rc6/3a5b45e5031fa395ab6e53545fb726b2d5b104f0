kcsan: Fix misreporting if concurrent races on same address

If there are at least 4 threads racing on the same address, it can
happen that one of the readers may observe another matching reader in
other_info. To avoid locking up, we have to consume 'other_info'
regardless, but skip the report. See the added comment for more details.
