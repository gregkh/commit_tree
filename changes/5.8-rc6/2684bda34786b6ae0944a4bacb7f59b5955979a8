net: phy: mscc: fix PHYs using the vsc8574_probe

PHYs using the vsc8574_probe fail to be initialized and their
config_init return -EIO leading to errors like:
"could not attach PHY: -5".

This is because when the conversion of the MSCC PHY driver to use the
shared PHY package helpers was done, the base address retrieval and the
base PHY read and write helpers in the driver were modified. In
particular, the base address retrieval logic was moved from the
config_init to the probe. But the vsc8574_probe was forgotten. This
patch fixes it.
