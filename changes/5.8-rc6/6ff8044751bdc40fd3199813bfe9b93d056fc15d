dpaa2-eth: use the bulk ring mode enqueue interface

Update the dpaa2-eth driver to use the bulk enqueue function introduced
with the change to QBMAN ring mode. At the moment, no functional changes
are made but rather the driver just transitions to the new interface
while still enqueuing just one frame at a time.
