bridge: mrp: Add support for role MRA

A node that has the MRA role, it can behave as MRM or MRC.

Initially it starts as MRM and sends MRP_Test frames on both ring ports.
If it detects that there are MRP_Test send by another MRM, then it
checks if these frames have a lower priority than itself. In this case
it would send MRP_Nack frames to notify the other node that it needs to
stop sending MRP_Test frames.
If it receives a MRP_Nack frame then it stops sending MRP_Test frames
and starts to behave as a MRC but it would continue to monitor the
MRP_Test frames send by MRM. If at a point the MRM stops to send
MRP_Test frames it would get the MRM role and start to send MRP_Test
frames.
