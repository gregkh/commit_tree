net/mlx5e: Return bool from TLS and IPSEC offloads

TLS and IPSEC offloads currently return struct sk_buff *, but the value
is either NULL or the same skb that was passed as a parameter. Return
bool instead to provide stronger guarantees to the calling code (it
won't need to support handling a different SKB that could be potentially
returned before this change) and to simplify restructuring this code in
the following commits.
