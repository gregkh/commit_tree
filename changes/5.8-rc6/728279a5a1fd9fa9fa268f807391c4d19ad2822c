afs: Fix use of afs_check_for_remote_deletion()

afs_check_for_remote_deletion() checks to see if error ENOENT is returned
by the server in response to an operation and, if so, marks the primary
vnode as having been deleted as the FID is no longer valid.

However, it's being called from the operation success functions, where no
abort has happened - and if an inline abort is recorded, it's handled by
afs_vnode_commit_status().

Fix this by actually calling the operation aborted method if provided and
having that point to afs_check_for_remote_deletion().
