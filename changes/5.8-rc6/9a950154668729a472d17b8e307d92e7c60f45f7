kbuild: use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT to construct LINUX_COMPILER macro

scripts/mkcompile_h runs $(CC) just for getting the version string.
Reuse CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT for optimization.

For GCC, this slightly changes the version string. I do not think it
is a big deal as we do not have the defined format for LINUX_COMPILER.
In fact, the recent commit 4dcc9a88448a ("kbuild: mkcompile_h:
Include $LD version in /proc/version") added the linker version.
