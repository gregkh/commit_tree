staging: wfx: fix display of exception indication

Until now, the exception received from the chip was only displayed if
driver was compiled with DEBUG enabled. It was not very convenient to
help users. We prefer to show the exception unconditionally.

In add, this patch provides the semantic of the first bytes of the
struct.
