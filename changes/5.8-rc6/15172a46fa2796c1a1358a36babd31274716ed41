bpf: net: Refactor bpf_iter target registration

Currently bpf_iter_reg_target takes parameters from target
and allocates memory to save them. This is really not
necessary, esp. in the future we may grow information
passed from targets to bpf_iter manager.

The patch refactors the code so target reg_info
becomes static and bpf_iter manager can just take
a reference to it.
