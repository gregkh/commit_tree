KVM: nSVM: implement KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE and KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE

Similar to VMX, the state that is captured through the currently available
IOCTLs is a mix of L1 and L2 state, dependent on whether the L2 guest was
running at the moment when the process was interrupted to save its state.

In particular, the SVM-specific state for nested virtualization includes
the L1 saved state (including the interrupt flag), the cached L2 controls,
and the GIF.
