PCI: amlogic: meson: Don't use FAST_LINK_MODE to set up link

The vim3l board does not work with a standard PCIe switch (ASM1184e),
spitting all kind of errors - hinting at HW misconfiguration (no link,
port enumeration issues, etc).

According to the the Synopsys DWC PCIe Reference Manual, in the section
dedicated to the PLCR register, bit 7 is described (FAST_LINK_MODE) as:

"Sets all internal timers to fast mode for simulation purposes."

it is sound to set this bit from a simulation perspective, but on actual
silicon, which expects timers to have a nominal value, it is not.

Make sure the FAST_LINK_MODE bit is cleared when configuring the RC
to solve this problem.
