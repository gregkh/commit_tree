drm/i915/perf: remove generated code

A little bit of history :

   Back when i915-perf was introduced (4.13), there was no way to
   dynamically add new OA configurations to i915. Only the generated
   configs baked in at build time were allowed.

   It quickly became obvious that we would need to allow applications
   to upload their own configurations, for instance to be able to test
   new ones, and so by the next stable version (4.14) we added uAPIs
   to allow uploading new configurations.

   When adding that capability, we took the opportunity to remove most
   HW configurations except the TestOa one which is a configuration
   IGT would rely on to verify that the HW is outputting correct
   values. At the time it made sense to have that confiuration in at
   the same time a given HW platform added to the i915-perf driver.

Now that IGT has become the reference point for HW configurations (see
commit 53f8f541ca ("lib: Add i915_perf library"), previously this was
located in the GPUTop repository), the need for having those
configurations in i915-perf is gone.

On the Mesa side, we haven't relied on this test configuration for a
while. The MDAPI library always required 4.14 feature level and always
loaded its configuration into i915.

I'm sure nobody will miss this generated stuff in i915 :)

v2: Fix selftests by creating an empty config

v3: Fix unlocking on allocation error (Dan Carpenter)

v4: Fixup checkpatch warnings

v5: Fix incorrect unlock in error path (Umesh)
