mm/slub: fix stack overruns with SLUB_STATS

There is no need to copy SLUB_STATS items from root memcg cache to new
memcg cache copies.  Doing so could result in stack overruns because the
store function only accepts 0 to clear the stat and returns an error for
everything else while the show method would print out the whole stat.

Then, the mismatch of the lengths returns from show and store methods
happens in memcg_propagate_slab_attrs():

	else if (root_cache->max_attr_size < ARRAY_SIZE(mbuf))
		buf = mbuf;

max_attr_size is only 2 from slab_attr_store(), then, it uses mbuf[64]
in show_stat() later where a bounch of sprintf() would overrun the stack
variable.  Fix it by always allocating a page of buffer to be used in
show_stat() if SLUB_STATS=y which should only be used for debug purpose.
