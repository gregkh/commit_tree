ixgbevf: Add XDP frame size to VF driver

This patch mirrors the changes to ixgbe in previous patch.

This VF driver doesn't support XDP_REDIRECT, but correct tailroom is
still necessary for BPF-helper xdp_adjust_tail.  In legacy-mode +
larger PAGE_SIZE, due to lacking tailroom, we accept that
xdp_adjust_tail shrink doesn't work.
