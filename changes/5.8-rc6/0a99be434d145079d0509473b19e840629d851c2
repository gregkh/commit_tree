net/smc: log important pnetid and state change events

Print to system log when SMC links are available or go down, link group
state changes or pnetids are applied to and removed from devices.
The log entries are triggered by either user configuration actions or
adapter activation/deactivation events and are not expected to happen
often. The entries help SMC users to keep track of the SMC link group
status and to detect when actions are needed (like to add replacements
for failed adapters).
