ALSA: hda: add autodetection for SoundWire

When an ACPI companion device is present and the SoundWire link mask
information is available, use SoundWire instead of legacy HDA or
Skylake drivers.

The SOF driver is selected when SoundWire or DMIC are detected. There
is no precedence at this level. In the SOF driver proper, SoundWire
will be handled first since it is mutually exclusive with HDaudio.

Known devices with an existing DMI quirk bypass this detection to
avoid any dependency on ACPI/DSDT tables.
