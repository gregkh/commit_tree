include/linux: Add instrumented.h infrastructure

This adds instrumented.h, which provides generic wrappers for memory
access instrumentation that the compiler cannot emit for various
sanitizers. Currently this unifies KASAN and KCSAN instrumentation. In
future this will also include KMSAN instrumentation.

Note that, copy_{to,from}_user should use special instrumentation, since
we should be able to instrument both source and destination memory
accesses if both are kernel memory.

The current patch only instruments the memory access where the address
is always in kernel space, however, both may in fact be kernel addresses
when a compat syscall passes an argument allocated in the kernel to a
real syscall. In a future change, both KASAN and KCSAN should check both
addresses in such cases, as well as KMSAN will make use of both
addresses. [It made more sense to provide the completed function
signature, rather than updating it and changing all locations again at a
later time.]
