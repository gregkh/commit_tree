arm64: BTI: Decode BYTPE bits when printing PSTATE

The current code to print PSTATE symbolically when generating
backtraces etc., does not include the BYTPE field used by Branch
Target Identification.

So, decode BYTPE and print it too.

In the interests of human-readability, print the classes of BTI
matched.  The symbolic notation, BYTPE (PSTATE[11:10]) and
permitted classes of subsequent instruction are:

    -- (BTYPE=0b00): any insn
    jc (BTYPE=0b01): BTI jc, BTI j, BTI c, PACIxSP
    -c (BYTPE=0b10): BTI jc, BTI c, PACIxSP
    j- (BTYPE=0b11): BTI jc, BTI j
