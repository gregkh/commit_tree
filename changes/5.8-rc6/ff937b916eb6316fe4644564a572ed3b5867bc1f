qed: Add EDPM mode type for user-fw compatibility

In older FW versions the completion flag was treated as the ack flag in
edpm messages. Expose the FW option of setting which mode the QP is in
by adding a flag to the qedr <-> qed API.

Flag is added for backward compatibility with libqedr.
This flag will be set by qedr after determining whether the libqedr is
using the updated version.
