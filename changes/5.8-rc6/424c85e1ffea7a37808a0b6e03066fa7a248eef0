dt-bindings: clock: Add and reorder ABI for X1000.

1.The SSI clock of X1000 not like JZ4770 and JZ4780, they are not
  directly derived from the output of SSIPLL, but from the clock
  obtained by dividing the frequency by 2. "X1000_CLK_SSIPLL_DIV2"
  is added for this purpose, it must between "X1000_CLK_SSIPLL"
  and "X1000_CLK_SSIMUX", otherwise an error will occurs when
  initializing the clock. These ABIs are only used for X1000, and
  I'm sure that no other devicetree out there is using these ABIs,
  so we should be able to reorder them.
2.Clocks of LCD, OTG, EMC, EFUSE, OST, TCU are also added.
