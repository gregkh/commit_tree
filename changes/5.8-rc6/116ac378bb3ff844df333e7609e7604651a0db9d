powerpc/64s: machine check interrupt update NMI accounting

machine_check_early() is taken as an NMI, so nmi_enter() is used
there. machine_check_exception() is no longer taken as an NMI (it's
invoked via irq_work in the case a machine check hits in kernel mode),
so remove the nmi_enter() from that case.

In NMI context, hash faults don't try to refill the hash table, which
can lead to crashes accessing non-pinned kernel pages. System reset
still has this potential problem.
