locking/atomics: Provide the arch_atomic_ interface to generic code

Architectures with instrumented (KASAN/KCSAN) atomic operations
natively provide arch_atomic_ variants that are not instrumented.

It turns out that some generic code also requires arch_atomic_ in
order to avoid instrumentation, so provide the arch_atomic_ interface
as a direct map into the regular atomic_ interface for
non-instrumented architectures.
