net: ks8851: Use 16-bit read of RXFC register

The RXFC register is the only one being read using 8-bit accessors.
To make it easier to support the 16-bit accesses used by the parallel
bus variant of KS8851, use 16-bit accessor to read RXFC register as
well as neighboring RXFCTR register.

Remove ks8851_rdreg8() as it is not used anywhere anymore.

There should be no functional change.
