gfs2: Turn gl_delete into a delayed work

This requires flushing delayed work items in gfs2_make_fs_ro (which is called
before unmounting a filesystem).

When inodes are deleted and then recreated, pending gl_delete work items would
have no effect because the inode generations will have changed, so we can
cancel any pending gl_delete works before reusing iopen glocks.
