ima: Directly free *entry in ima_alloc_init_template() if digests is NULL

To support multiple template digests, the static array entry->digest has
been replaced with a dynamically allocated array in commit aa724fe18a8a
("ima: Switch to dynamically allocated buffer for template digests"). The
array is allocated in ima_alloc_init_template() and if the returned pointer
is NULL, ima_free_template_entry() is called.

However, (*entry)->template_desc is not yet initialized while it is used by
ima_free_template_entry(). This patch fixes the issue by directly freeing
*entry without calling ima_free_template_entry().
