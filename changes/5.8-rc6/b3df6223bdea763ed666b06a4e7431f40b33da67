scripts: sphinx-pre-install: improve openSuse Tumbleweed check

Currently, with openSUSE Tumbleweed 20200303, it keeps
recommending this forever:

	sudo zypper install --no-recommends rsvg-view

This dependency will never be fulfilled there, as the package
now is named as on other distros: rsvg-convert.

So, improve the detection to avoid such issue.
