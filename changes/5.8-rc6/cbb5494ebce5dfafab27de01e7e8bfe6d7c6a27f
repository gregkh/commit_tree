Revert "thunderbolt: Prevent crash if non-active NVMem file is read"

This reverts commit 03cd45d2e219301880cabc357e3cf478a500080f.

Commit 664f0549380c ("nvmem: core: use is_bin_visible for permissions")
incidentally adds support for write-only nvmem. Hence, this workaround
is no longer required, so drop it.
