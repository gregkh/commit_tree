mmc: sdhci-msm: Read and use DLL Config property from device tree file

Certain platforms require different settings in the
SDCC_HC_REG_DLL_CONFIG register. This setting can change from platform
to platform. So the driver should check whether a particular platform
require a different setting by reading the DT file and use it.

Also use msm_cm_dll_set_freq only when DLL not supplied.
