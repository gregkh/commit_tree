gpio: xgene-sb: Drop redundant OF_GPIO dependency

There is nothing in the driver requires OF_GPIO. Moreover, driver
supports ACPI and OF_GPIO may be a quite overhead on such configurations.

Drop dependency for good and replace of_gpio.h to of.h since we have
one function to be defined from there.
