mips: Fix cpu_has_mips64r1/2 activation for MIPS32 CPUs

Commit 1aeba347b3a9 ("MIPS: Hardcode cpu_has_mips* where target ISA
allows") updated the cpu_has_mips* macro to be replaced with a constant
expression where it's possible. By mistake it wasn't done correctly
for cpu_has_mips64r1/cpu_has_mips64r2 macro. They are defined to
be replaced with conditional expression __isa_range_or_flag(), which
means either ISA revision being within the range or the corresponding
CPU options flag was set at the probe stage or both being true at the
same time. But the ISA level value doesn't indicate whether the ISA is
MIPS32 or MIPS64. Due to this if we select MIPS32r1 - MIPS32r5
architectures the __isa_range() macro will activate the
cpu_has_mips64rX flags, which is incorrect. In order to fix the
problem we make sure the 64bits CPU support is enabled by means of
checking the flag cpu_has_64bits aside with proper ISA range and specific
Revision flag being set.
