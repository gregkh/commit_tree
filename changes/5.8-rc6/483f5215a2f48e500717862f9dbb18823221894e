media: atomisp: atomisp_compat_ioctl32.c: be independent of ISP version

There are two ioctls that are only available with ISP2401. Yet,
at the compat level, we don't really need to take care, as
the native ioctl handler will already return an error code if
the ioctl doesn't exist.

So, let's just remove the ifdefs here.
