PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Eliminate the 'reserved' member

Per PCIe 5.0 r1.0, Terms and Acronyms, Page 80:

  Reserved register fields must be read only and must return 0 (all 0's
  for multi-bit fields) when read. Reserved encodings for register and
  packet fields must not be used. Any implementation dependence on a
  Reserved field value or encoding will result in an implementation that
  is not PCI Express-compliant.

This patch ensures reads will return 0 for any bit not in the Read-Only,
Read-Write, or Write-1-to-Clear bitmasks.
