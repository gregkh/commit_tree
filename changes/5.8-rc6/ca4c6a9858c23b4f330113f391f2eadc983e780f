x86/traps: Make interrupt enable/disable symmetric in C code

Traps enable interrupts conditionally but rely on the ASM return code to
disable them again. That results in redundant interrupt disable and trace
calls.

Make the trap handlers disable interrupts before returning to avoid that,
which allows simplification of the ASM entry code in follow up changes.
