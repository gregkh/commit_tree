io_uring: acquire 'mm' for task_work for SQPOLL

If we're unlucky with timing, we could be running task_work after
having dropped the memory context in the sq thread. Since dropping
the context requires a runnable task state, we cannot reliably drop
it as part of our check-for-work loop in io_sq_thread(). Instead,
abstract out the mm acquire for the sq thread into a helper, and call
it from the async task work handler.
