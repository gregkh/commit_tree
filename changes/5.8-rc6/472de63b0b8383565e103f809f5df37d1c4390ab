firmware: arm_sdei: Document the motivation behind these set_fs() calls

The SDEI handler save/restores the addr_limit using set_fs(). It isn't
very clear why. The reason is to mirror the arch code's entry assembly.
The arch code does this because perf may access user-space, and
inheriting the addr_limit may be a problem.

Add a comment explaining why this is here.
