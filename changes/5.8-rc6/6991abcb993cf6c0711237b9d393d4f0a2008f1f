IB/hfi1: Add functions to receive accelerated ipoib packets

Ipoib netdev will share receive contexts with existing VNIC netdev.
To achieve that, a dummy netdev is allocated with hfi1_devdata to
own the receive contexts, and ipoib and VNIC netdevs will be put
on top of it. Each receive context is associated with a single
NAPI object.

This patch adds the functions to receive incoming packets for
accelerated ipoib.
