i2c: pxa: clear all master action bits in i2c_pxa_stop_message()

If we timeout during a message transfer, the control register may
contain bits that cause an action to be set. Read-modify-writing the
register leaving these bits set may trigger the hardware to attempt
one of these actions unintentionally.

Always clear these bits when cleaning up after a message or after
a timeout.
