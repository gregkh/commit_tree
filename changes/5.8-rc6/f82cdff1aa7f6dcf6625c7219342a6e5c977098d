x86/mce: Drop bogus comment about mce.kflags

The bit definitions for kflags are for internal use only. A
late edit moved them from uapi/asm/mce.h to the internal
x86 <asm/mce.h>, but the comment saying "See below" was
accidentally left here.

Delete "See below". Just labelling this field as internal
kernel use is sufficient.
