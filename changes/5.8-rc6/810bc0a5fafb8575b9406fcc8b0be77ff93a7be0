tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: make coverity happy

Coverity reports the following:

  var_compare_op: Comparing chan to null implies that chan might be null.

  1234        if (chan)
  1235                dmaengine_terminate_all(chan);
  1236

  Dereference after null check (FORWARD_NULL)
  var_deref_op: Dereferencing null pointer chan.

  1237        dma_unmap_sg(chan->device->dev, &sport->rx_sgl, 1, DMA_FROM_DEVICE);

Technically, this is correct. But lpuart_dma_rx_free() is guarded by
lpuart_dma_rx_use which is only true if there is a dma channel, see
lpuart_rx_dma_startup(). In any way, this looks bogus. So remove
the superfluous "if (chan)" check and make coverity happy.
