media: atomisp: avoid OOPS due to non-existing ref_frames

stage->args->delay_frames array could point to NULL frames.

What's weird is that we didn't notice this behavior with the
Intel Aero Yocto code.

Handle it, while adding a notice at the code, as this could
be due to some broken pipeline setup.
