phy: amlogic: meson8b-usb2: unset the IDDQ bit during PHY power-on

The vendor driver unsets the set_iddig bit during power-on as well and
sets it when suspending the PHY. I did not notice this in the vendor
driver first, because it's part of the dwc_otg driver there (instead of
their PHY code). While here, also add all other REG_DBG_UART register
bit definitions.
