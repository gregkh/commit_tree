net/mlx5: Add support for release all pages event

If FW sets release_all_pages bit in MLX5_EVENT_TYPE_PAGE_REQUEST,
driver shall release all pages of a given function id, with no further
pages reclaim negotiation with FW nor MANAGE_PAGES commands from driver
towards FW.

Upon receiving this bit as part of pages reclaim event, driver will
initiate release all flow, in which it will iterate and release all
function's pages.

As part of driver <-> FW capabilities handshake, FW will report
release_all_pages max HCA cap bit, and driver will set the
release_all_pages bit in HCA cap.

NIC: ConnectX-4 Lx
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v2 @ 2.60GHz
Test case: Simulataniously FLR 4 VFs, and measure FW release pages by
driver.
Before: 3.18 Sec
After:  0.31 Sec
