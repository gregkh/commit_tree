pstore: Convert "psinfo" locking to mutex

Currently pstore can only have a single backend attached at a time, and it
tracks the active backend via "psinfo", under a lock. The locking for this
does not need to be a spinlock, and in order to avoid may_sleep() issues
during future changes to pstore_unregister(), switch to a mutex instead.
