iio: move 'indio_dev->info' null check first in __iio_device_register()

Moves this to be the first check, as it's very simple and fails the
registration earlier, instead of potentially initializing the
'indio_dev->label' and checking for duplicate indexes, and then failing
with this simple-check.

This is a minor optimization, since '__iio_device_register()' will waste
fewer validation cycles in case 'indio_dev->info' is NULL.
