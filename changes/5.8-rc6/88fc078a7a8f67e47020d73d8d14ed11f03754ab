x86/module: Use text_poke() for late relocations

Because of late module patching, a livepatch module needs to be able to
apply some of its relocations well after it has been loaded.  Instead of
playing games with module_{dis,en}able_ro(), use existing text poking
mechanisms to apply relocations after module loading.

So far only x86, s390 and Power have HAVE_LIVEPATCH but only the first
two also have STRICT_MODULE_RWX.

This will allow removal of the last module_disable_ro() usage in
livepatch.  The ultimate goal is to completely disallow making
executable mappings writable.

[ jpoimboe: Split up patches.  Use mod state to determine whether
	    memcpy() can be used.  Implement text_poke() for UML. ]
