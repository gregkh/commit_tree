checkpatch: additional MAINTAINER section entry ordering checks

There is a preferred order for the entries in MAINTAINERS sections.

See commits 3b50142d8528 ("MAINTAINERS: sort field names for all
entries") and 6680125ea5a2 ("MAINTAINERS: list the section entries in
the preferred order")

Add checkpatch tests to try to keep that ordering.
