Revert "tpm: selftest: cleanup after unseal with wrong auth/policy test"

The reverted commit illegitly uses tpm2-tools. External dependencies are
absolutely forbidden from these tests. There is also the problem that
clearing is not necessarily wanted behavior if the test/target computer is
not used only solely for testing.
