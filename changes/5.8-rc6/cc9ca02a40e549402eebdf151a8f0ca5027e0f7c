dt-bindings: power: meson-ee-pwrc: add support for the Meson GX SoCs

The power domains on the GX SoCs are very similar to G12A. The only
known differences so far are:
- The GX SoCs do not have the HHI_VPU_MEM_PD_REG2 register (for the
  VPU power-domain)
- The GX SoCs have an additional reset line called "dvin"

Add a new compatible string and adjust the reset line expectations for
these SoCs.
