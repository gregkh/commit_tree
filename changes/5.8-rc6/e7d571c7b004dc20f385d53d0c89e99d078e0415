btrfs: reloc: remove the open-coded goto loop for breadth-first search

build_backref_tree() uses "goto again;" to implement a breadth-first
search to build backref cache.

This patch will extract most of its work into a wrapper,
handle_one_tree_block(), and use a do {} while() loop to implement the
same thing.
