Crypto/chcr: Fixes compilations warnings

This patch fixes the compilation warnings displayed by sparse tool for
chcr driver.

V1->V2

Avoid type casting by using get_unaligned_be32() and
put_unaligned_be16/32() functions.

The key which comes from stack is an u8 byte stream so we store it in
an unsigned char array(ablkctx->key). The function get_aes_decrypt_key()
is a used to calculate  the reverse round key for decryption, for this
operation the key has to be divided into 4 bytes, so to extract 4 bytes
from an u8 byte stream and store it in an u32 variable, get_aligned_be32()
is used. Similarly for copying back the key from u32 variable to the
original u8 key stream, put_aligned_be32() is used.
