KVM: MIPS: Add more types of virtual interrupts

In current implementation, MIPS KVM uses IP2, IP3, IP4 and IP7 for
external interrupt, two kinds of IPIs and timer interrupt respectively,
but Loongson-3 based machines prefer to use IP2, IP3, IP6 and IP7 for
two kinds of external interrupts, IPI and timer interrupt. So we define
two priority-irq mapping tables: kvm_loongson3_priority_to_irq[] for
Loongson-3, and kvm_default_priority_to_irq[] for others. The virtual
interrupt infrastructure is updated to deliver all types of interrupts
from IP2, IP3, IP4, IP6 and IP7.
