x86/resctrl: Rename asm/resctrl_sched.h to asm/resctrl.h

asm/resctrl_sched.h is dedicated to the code used for configuration
of the CPU resource control state when a task is scheduled.

Rename resctrl_sched.h to resctrl.h in preparation of additions that
will no longer make this file dedicated to work done during scheduling.

No functional change.
