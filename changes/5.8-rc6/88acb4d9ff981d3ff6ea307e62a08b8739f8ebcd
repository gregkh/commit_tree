scsi: lpfc: Remove unnecessary lockdep_assert_held calls

In an audit of lockdep calls in the driver, there are multiple lockdep
checks in successive calling layers. E.g. a routine checks, and then calls
a lower routine that also checks, and so on. Calling sequences result in
many redundant checks.

Refine the code to remove lower-level lockdep checks.  Update comments on
the lock, correcting a few places where lock object in comment was
incorrect.
