nvme: don't protect ns mutation with ns->head->lock

Right now ns->head->lock is protecting namespace mutation
which is wrong and unneeded. Move it to only protect
against head mutations. While we're at it, remove unnecessary
ns->head reference as we already have head pointer.

The problem with this is that the head->lock spans
mpath disk node I/O that may block under some conditions (if
for example the controller is disconnecting or the path
became inaccessible), The locking scheme does not allow any
other path to enable itself, preventing blocked I/O to complete
and forward-progress from there.

This is a preparation patch for the fix in a subsequent patch
where the disk I/O will also be done outside the head->lock.
