nvmet-fc: perform small cleanups on unneeded checks

While code reviewing saw a couple of items that can be cleaned up:
- In nvmet_fc_delete_target_queue(), the routine unlocks, then checks
  and relocks.  Reorganize to avoid the unlock/relock.
- In nvmet_fc_delete_target_queue(), there's a check on the disconnect
  state that is unnecessary as the routine validates the state before
  starting any action.
