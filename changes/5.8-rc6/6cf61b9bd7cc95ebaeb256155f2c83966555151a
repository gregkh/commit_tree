tty: serial: Add modem control gpio support for STM32 UART

STM32 UART controllers have the built in modem control support using
dedicated gpios which can be enabled using 'st,hw-flow-ctrl' flag in DT.
But there might be cases where the board design need to use different
gpios for modem control.

For supporting such cases, this commit adds modem control gpio support
to STM32 UART controller using mctrl_gpio driver.
