block/floppy: fix contended case in floppy_queue_rq()

Since the switch of floppy driver to blk-mq, the contended (fdc_busy) case
in floppy_queue_rq() is not handled correctly.

In case we reach floppy_queue_rq() with fdc_busy set (i.e. with the floppy
locked due to another request still being in-flight), we put the request
on the list of requests and return BLK_STS_OK to the block core, without
actually scheduling delayed work / doing further processing of the
request. This means that processing of this request is postponed until
another request comes and passess uncontended.

Which in some cases might actually never happen and we keep waiting
indefinitely. The simple testcase is

	for i in `seq 1 2000`; do echo -en $i '\r'; blkid --info /dev/fd0 2> /dev/null; done

run in quemu. That reliably causes blkid eventually indefinitely hanging
in __floppy_read_block_0() waiting for completion, as the BIO callback
never happens, and no further IO is ever submitted on the (non-existent)
floppy device. This was observed reliably on qemu-emulated device.

Fix that by not queuing the request in the contended case, and return
BLK_STS_RESOURCE instead, so that blk core handles the request
rescheduling and let it pass properly non-contended later.
