pstore: Do not leave timer disabled for next backend

The pstore.update_ms value was being disabled during pstore_unregister(),
which would cause any prior value to go unnoticed on the next
pstore_register(). Instead, just let del_timer() stop the timer, which
was always sufficient. This additionally refactors the timer reset code
and allows the timer to be enabled if the module parameter is changed
away from the default.
