media: atomisp: Clean up if block in sh_css_sp_init_stage

Clang warns:

../drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/sh_css_sp.c:1039:23: warning:
address of 'binary->in_frame_info' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                } else if (&binary->in_frame_info) {
                       ~~   ~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~

in_frame_info is not a pointer so if binary is not NULL, in_frame_info's
address cannot be NULL. Change this to an else since it will always be
evaluated as one.

While we are here, clean up this if block. The contents of both if
blocks are the same but a check against "stage == 0" is added when
ISP2401 is defined. USE_INPUT_SYSTEM_VERSION_2401 is only defined when
isp2401_system_global.h is included, which only happens when ISP2401. In
other words, USE_INPUT_SYSTEM_VERSION_2401 always requires ISP2401 to be
defined so the '#ifndef ISP2401' makes no sense. Remove that part of the
block to simplify everything.
