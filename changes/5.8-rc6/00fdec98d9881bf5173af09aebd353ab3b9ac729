ARC: entry: fix potential EFA clobber when TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE

Trap handler for syscall tracing reads EFA (Exception Fault Address),
in case strace wants PC of trap instruction (EFA is not part of pt_regs
as of current code).

However this EFA read is racy as it happens after dropping to pure
kernel mode (re-enabling interrupts). A taken interrupt could
context-switch, trigger a different task's trap, clobbering EFA for this
execution context.

Fix this by reading EFA early, before re-enabling interrupts. A slight
side benefit is de-duplication of FAKE_RET_FROM_EXCPN in trap handler.
The trap handler is common to both ARCompact and ARCv2 builds too.

This just came out of code rework/review and no real problem was reported
but is clearly a potential problem specially for strace.
