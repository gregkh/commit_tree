mlxsw: spectrum_trap: Store all trap data in one array

Each trap registered with devlink is mapped to one or more Rx listeners.
These listeners allow the switch driver (e.g., mlxsw_spectrum) to
register a function that is called when a packet is received (trapped)
for a specific reason.

Currently, three arrays are used to describe the mapping between the
logical devlink traps and the Rx listeners.

Instead, get rid of these arrays and store all the information in one
array that is easier to validate and extend with more per-trap
information.
