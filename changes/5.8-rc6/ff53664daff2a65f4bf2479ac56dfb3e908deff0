ALSA: hda/realtek: enable headset mic of ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14(G401) series with ALC289

This patch adds support for headset mic to the ASUS ROG Zephyrus
G14(GA401) notebook series by adding the corresponding
vendor/pci_device id, as well as adding a new fixup for the used
realtek ALC289. The fixup stets the correct pin to get the headset mic
correctly recognized on audio-jack.
