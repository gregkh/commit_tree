media: venus: core: remove CNOC voting while device suspend

The Venus driver is voting Configuration NoC during .probe but not clear
voting in .suspend. Because of this NoC is up during shutdown also. As a
consequence the whole device could leak energy while in .suspend.

So correct this by moving voting in .resume and unvoting
in .suspend
