arm64: vdso: Don't prefix sigreturn trampoline with a BTI C instruction

For better or worse, GDB relies on the exact instruction sequence in the
VDSO sigreturn trampoline in order to unwind from signals correctly.
Commit c91db232da48 ("arm64: vdso: Convert to modern assembler annotations")
unfortunately added a BTI C instruction to the start of __kernel_rt_sigreturn,
which breaks this check. Thankfully, it's also not required, since the
trampoline is called from a RET instruction when returning from the signal
handler

Remove the unnecessary BTI C instruction from __kernel_rt_sigreturn,
and do the same for the 32-bit VDSO as well for good measure.
