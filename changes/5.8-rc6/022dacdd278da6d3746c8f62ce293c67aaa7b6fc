ARM: clps711x: Drop unneeded select of multi-platform selected options

Support for Cirrus Logic EP721x/EP731x-based SoCs depends on
ARCH_MULTI_V7, and thus on ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.
As the latter selects AUTO_ZRELADDR, TIMER_OF, COMMON_CLK,
GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS, and USE_OF, there is no need for ARCH_CLPS711X to
select any of them.
