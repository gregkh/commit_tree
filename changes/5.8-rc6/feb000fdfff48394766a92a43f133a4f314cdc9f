drm/amd/powerplay: skip judging if baco support for Arcturus sriov

since for sriov, baco happens on host side, no need and meaning
to judge is baco.
also, since kiq reads strap0 in here, if kiq is not ready
or gpu reset(kiq resume) happens after this read, would fail
to read and wrongly set baco as true(1).
