btrfs: backref: rename and move should_ignore_root()

This function is mostly single purpose to relocation backref cache, but
since we're moving the main part of backref cache to backref.c, we need
to export such function.

And to avoid confusion, rename the function to
btrfs_should_ignore_reloc_root() make the name a little more clear.
