scsi: mpt3sas: Fix memset() in non-RDPQ mode

Fix memset() accessing out of range address when reply_queue count is less
than RDPQ_MAX_INDEX_IN_ONE_CHUNK (i.e. 16) in non-RDPQ mode.

In non-RDPQ mode, the driver allocates a single contiguous pool of size
reply_queue's count * reqly_post_free_sz. But the driver is always
memsetting this pool with size 16 * reqly_post_free_sz. If reply queue
count is less than 16 (i.e. when MSI-X vectors enabled < 16), the driver is
accessing out of range address and this results in 'BUG: unable to handle
kernel paging request at fff0x...x' bug.

Make driver use dma_pool_zalloc() API to allocate and zero the pool.
