ice: Fix check for removing/adding mac filters

In function ice_set_mac_address, we will remove old dev_addr before
adding the new MAC. In the removing and adding process of the MAC,
there is no need to return error if the check finds the to-be-removed
dev_addr does not exist in the MAC filter list or the to-be-added mac
already exists, keep going or return success accordingly.
