bus: mhi: core: Add range check for channel id received in event ring

MHI data completion handler function reads channel id from event
ring element. Value is under the control of MHI devices and can be
any value between 0 and 255. In order to prevent out of bound access
add a bound check against the max channel supported by controller
and skip processing of that event ring element.
