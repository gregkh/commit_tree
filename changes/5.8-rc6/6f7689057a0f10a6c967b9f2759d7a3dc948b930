net: bcmgenet: Fix WoL with password after deep sleep

Broadcom STB chips support a deep sleep mode where all register contents
are lost. Because we were stashing the MagicPacket password into some of
these registers a suspend into that deep sleep then a resumption would
not lead to being able to wake-up from MagicPacket with password again.

Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it
during suspend.
