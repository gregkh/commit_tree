net: dsa: microchip: set the correct number of ports

The number of ports is incorrectly set to the maximum available for a DSA
switch. Even if the extra ports are not used, this causes some functions
to be called later, like port_disable() and port_stp_state_set(). If the
driver doesn't check the port index, it will end up modifying unknown
registers.
