nvmet-fc: Better size LS buffers

Current code uses NVME_FC_MAX_LS_BUFFER_SIZE (2KB) when allocating
buffers for LS requests and responses. This is considerable overkill
for what is actually defined.

Rework code to have unions for all possible requests and responses
and size based on the unions.  Remove NVME_FC_MAX_LS_BUFFER_SIZE.
