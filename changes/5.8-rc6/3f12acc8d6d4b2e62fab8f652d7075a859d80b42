drm/amdgpu: put the audio codec into suspend state before gpu reset V3

At default, the autosuspend delay of audio controller is 3S. If the
gpu reset is triggered within 3S(after audio controller idle),
the audio controller may be unable into suspended state. Then
the sudden gpu reset will cause some audio errors. The change
here is targeted to resolve this.

However if the audio controller is in use when the gpu reset
triggered, this change may be still not enough to put the
audio controller into suspend state. Under this case, the
gpu reset will still proceed but there will be a warning
message printed("failed to suspend display audio").

V2: limit this for BACO and mode1 reset only
V3: try 1st to use pm_runtime_autosuspend_expiration() to
    query how much time is left. Use default setting on
    failure
