efivarfs: Don't return -EINTR when rate-limiting reads

Applications that read EFI variables may see a return
value of -EINTR if they exceed the rate limit and a
signal delivery is attempted while the process is sleeping.

This is quite surprising to the application, which probably
doesn't have code to handle it.

Change the interruptible sleep to a non-interruptible one.
