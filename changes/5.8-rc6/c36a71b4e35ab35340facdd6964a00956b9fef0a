ext4: fix EXT_MAX_EXTENT/INDEX to check for zeroed eh_max

If eh->eh_max is 0, EXT_MAX_EXTENT/INDEX would evaluate to unsigned
(-1) resulting in illegal memory accesses. Although there is no
consistent repro, we see that generic/019 sometimes crashes because of
this bug.

Ran gce-xfstests smoke and verified that there were no regressions.
