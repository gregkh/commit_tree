ALSA: firewire-lib: add cache for packet sequence to AMDTP domain structure

For future extension, storage is required to store packet sequence in
incoming AMDTP stream to recover media clock for outgoing AMDTP stream.

This commit adds the storage to AMDTP domain for this purpose. The
packet sequence is represented by 'struct seq_desc' which has two
members; syt_offset and the number of data blocks. The size of storage
is decided according to the size of packet queue.
