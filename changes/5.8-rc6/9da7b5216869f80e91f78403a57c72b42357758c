mm: memcontrol: prepare cgroup vmstat infrastructure for native anon counters

Anonymous compound pages can be mapped by ptes, which means that if we
want to track NR_MAPPED_ANON, NR_ANON_THPS on a per-cgroup basis, we have
to be prepared to see tail pages in our accounting functions.

Make mod_lruvec_page_state() and lock_page_memcg() deal with tail pages
correctly, namely by redirecting to the head page which has the
page->mem_cgroup set up.
