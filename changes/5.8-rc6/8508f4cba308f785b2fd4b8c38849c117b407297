Which seems to be due to the fact that after allocating the uap
structure, nothing initializes the spinlock.

Its a little confusing, as uart_port_spin_lock_init() is one
place where the lock is supposed to be initialized, but it has
an exception for the case where the port is a console.

This makes it seem like a deeper fix is needed to properly
register the console, but I'm not sure what that entails, and
Andy suggested that this approach is less invasive.

Thus, this patch resolves the issue by initializing the spinlock
in the driver, and resolves the resulting warning.
