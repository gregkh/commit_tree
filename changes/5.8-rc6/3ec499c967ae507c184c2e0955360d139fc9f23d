habanalabs: don't wait for ASIC CPU after reset

Upon reset of the ASIC, the driver would have waited for the CPU to come
out of reset before finishing the reset process. This was done for the
purpose of making the CPU available to answer FLR requests. However, when a
VM shuts down, the driver isn't removed so a reset never happens.
Therefore, remove this waiting period as we don't need it.
