io_uring: fix regression with always ignoring signals in io_cqring_wait()

When switching to TWA_SIGNAL for task_work notifications, we also made
any signal based condition in io_cqring_wait() return -ERESTARTSYS.
This breaks applications that rely on using signals to abort someone
waiting for events.

Check if we have a signal pending because of queued task_work, and
repeat the signal check once we've run the task_work. This provides a
reliable way of telling the two apart.

Additionally, only use TWA_SIGNAL if we are using an eventfd. If not,
we don't have the dependency situation described in the original commit,
and we can get by with just using TWA_RESUME like we previously did.
