dma-direct: check return value when encrypting or decrypting memory

__change_page_attr() can fail which will cause set_memory_encrypted() and
set_memory_decrypted() to return non-zero.

If the device requires unencrypted DMA memory and decryption fails, simply
free the memory and fail.

If attempting to re-encrypt in the failure path and that encryption fails,
there is no alternative other than to leak the memory.
