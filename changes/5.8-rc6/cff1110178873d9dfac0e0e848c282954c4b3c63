arm64: dts: allwinner: sun50i-a64: Add missing address/size-cells

The binding specifies #address-cells and #size-cells should be present.
Without them present, dtc issues a warning because default for
#address-cells seems to be <2>:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/sun50i-a64.dtsi:1108.4-52:
  Warning (dma_ranges_format):
    /soc/dram-controller@1c62000:dma-ranges:
    "dma-ranges" property has invalid length (12 bytes)
    (parent #address-cells == 1, child #address-cells == 2,
    #size-cells == 1)

mbus #address-cells should be 1.
