USB: pci-quirks: Add Raspberry Pi 4 quirk

On the Raspberry Pi 4, after a PCI reset, VL805's firmware may either be
loaded directly from an EEPROM or, if not present, by the SoC's
VideoCore. Inform VideoCore that VL805 was just reset.

Also, as this creates a dependency between USB_PCI and VideoCore's
firmware interface, and since USB_PCI can't be set as a module neither
this can. Reflect that on the firmware interface Kconfg.
