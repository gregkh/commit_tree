mm: move readahead prototypes from mm.h

Patch series "Change readahead API", v11.

This series adds a readahead address_space operation to replace the
readpages operation.  The key difference is that pages are added to the
page cache as they are allocated (and then looked up by the filesystem)
instead of passing them on a list to the readpages operation and having
the filesystem add them to the page cache.  It's a net reduction in code
for each implementation, more efficient than walking a list, and solves
the direct-write vs buffered-read problem reported by yu kuai at
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200116063601.39201-1-yukuai3@huawei.com

The only unconverted filesystems are those which use fscache.  Their
conversion is pending Dave Howells' rewrite which will make the
conversion substantially easier.  This should be completed by the end of
the year.

I want to thank the reviewers/testers; Dave Chinner, John Hubbard, Eric
Biggers, Johannes Thumshirn, Dave Sterba, Zi Yan, Christoph Hellwig and
Miklos Szeredi have done a marvellous job of providing constructive
criticism.

These patches pass an xfstests run on ext4, xfs & btrfs with no
regressions that I can tell (some of the tests seem a little flaky
before and remain flaky afterwards).

This patch (of 25):

The readahead code is part of the page cache so should be found in the
pagemap.h file.  force_page_cache_readahead is only used within mm, so
move it to mm/internal.h instead.  Remove the parameter names where they
add no value, and rename the ones which were actively misleading.
