connector/cn_proc: Protect send_msg() with a local lock

send_msg() disables preemption to avoid out-of-order messages. As the
code inside the preempt disabled section acquires regular spinlocks,
which are converted to 'sleeping' spinlocks on a PREEMPT_RT kernel and
eventually calls into a memory allocator, this conflicts with the RT
semantics.

Convert it to a local_lock which allows RT kernels to substitute them with
a real per CPU lock. On non RT kernels this maps to preempt_disable() as
before. No functional change.
