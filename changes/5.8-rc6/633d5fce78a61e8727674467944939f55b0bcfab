dma-direct: always align allocation size in dma_direct_alloc_pages()

dma_alloc_contiguous() does size >> PAGE_SHIFT and set_memory_decrypted()
works at page granularity.  It's necessary to page align the allocation
size in dma_direct_alloc_pages() for consistent behavior.

This also fixes an issue when arch_dma_prep_coherent() is called on an
unaligned allocation size for dma_alloc_need_uncached() when
CONFIG_DMA_DIRECT_REMAP is disabled but CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_DMA_SET_UNCACHED
is enabled.
