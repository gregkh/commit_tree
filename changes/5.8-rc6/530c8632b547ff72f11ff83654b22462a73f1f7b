IB/mlx5: Fix 50G per lane indication

Some released FW versions mistakenly don't set the capability that 50G per
lane link-modes are supported for VFs (ptys_extended_ethernet capability
bit).

Use PTYS.ext_eth_proto_capability instead, as this indication is always
accurate. If PTYS.ext_eth_proto_capability is valid
(has a non-zero value) conclude that the HCA supports 50G per lane.

Otherwise, conclude that the HCA doesn't support 50G per lane.
