dpaa2-eth: Update FQ taildrop threshold and buffer pool count

Now that we have congestion group taildrop configured at all
times, we can afford to increase the frame queue taildrop
threshold; this will ensure a better response when receiving
bursts of large-sized frames.

Also decouple the buffer pool count from the Rx FQ taildrop
threshold, as above change would increase it too much. Instead,
keep the old count as a hardcoded value.

With the new limits, we try to ensure that:
* we allow enough leeway for large frame bursts (by buffering
enough of them in queues to avoid heavy dropping in case of
bursty traffic, but when overall ingress bandwidth is manageable)
* allow pending frames to be evenly spread between ingress FQs,
regardless of frame size
* avoid dropping frames due to the buffer pool being empty; this
is not a bad behaviour per se, but system overall response is
more linear and predictable when frames are dropped at frame
queue/group level.
