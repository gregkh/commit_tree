nvme: introduce NVME_INLINE_METADATA_SG_CNT

SGL size of metadata is usually small. Thus, 1 inline sg should cover
most cases. The macro will be used for pre-allocate a single SGL entry
for metadata. The preallocation of small inline SGLs depends on SG_CHAIN
capability so if the ARCH doesn't support SG_CHAIN, use the runtime
allocation for the SGL. This patch is a preparation for adding metadata
(T10-PI) over fabric support.
