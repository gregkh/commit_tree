signal: refactor copy_siginfo_to_user32

Factor out a copy_siginfo_to_external32 helper from
copy_siginfo_to_user32 that fills out the compat_siginfo, but does so
on a kernel space data structure.  With that we can let architectures
override copy_siginfo_to_user32 with their own implementations using
copy_siginfo_to_external32.  That allows moving the x32 SIGCHLD purely
to x86 architecture code.

As a nice side effect copy_siginfo_to_external32 also comes in handy
for avoiding a set_fs() call in the coredump code later on.

Contains improvements from Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
and Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>.
