hyper-v: Use UUID API for exporting the GUID (part 2)

This is a follow up to the commit 1d3c9c075462
  ("hyper-v: Use UUID API for exporting the GUID")
which starts the conversion.

There is export_guid() function which exports guid_t to the u8 array.
Use it instead of open coding variant.

This allows to hide the uuid_t internals.
