dt-bindings: clk: Add Baikal-T1 CCU Dividers binding

After being gained by the CCU PLLs the signals must be transformed to
be suitable for the clock-consumers. This is done by a set of dividers
embedded into the CCU. A first block of dividers is used to create
reference clocks for AXI-bus of high-speed peripheral IP-cores of the
chip. The second block dividers alter the PLLs output signals to be then
consumed by SoC peripheral devices. Both block DT nodes are ordinary
clock-providers with standard set of properties supported. But in addition
to that each clock provider can be used to reset the corresponding clock
domain. This makes the AXI-bus and System Devices CCU DT nodes to be also
reset-providers.
