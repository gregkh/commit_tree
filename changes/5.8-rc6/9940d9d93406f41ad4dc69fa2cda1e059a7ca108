drm/exynos: gem: Get rid of the internal 'pages' array

Internal pages array and scatter-list for them is not really needed for
anything. FBDev emulation can simply rely on the DMA-mapping framework
to create a proper kernel mapping for the buffer, while all other buffer
use cases don't really need that array at all.
