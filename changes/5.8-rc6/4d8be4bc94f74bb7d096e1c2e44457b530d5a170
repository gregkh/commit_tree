ACPI: CPPC: Fix reference count leak in acpi_cppc_processor_probe()

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
properly clean up the memory associated with the object. Previous
commit "b8eb718348b8" fixed a similar problem.
