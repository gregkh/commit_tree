drm/amd: fix potential memleak in err branch

The function kobject_init_and_add alloc memory like:
kobject_init_and_add->kobject_add_varg->kobject_set_name_vargs
->kvasprintf_const->kstrdup_const->kstrdup->kmalloc_track_caller
->kmalloc_slab, in err branch this memory not free. If use
kmemleak, this path maybe catched.
These changes are to add kobject_put in kobject_init_and_add
failed branch, fix potential memleak.
