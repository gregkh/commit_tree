phy: intel: fix enum type mismatch warning

clang points out that a local variable is initialized with
an enum value of the wrong type:

drivers/phy/intel/phy-intel-combo.c:202:34: error: implicit conversion from enumeration type 'enum intel_phy_mode' to different enumeration type 'enum intel_combo_mode' [-Werror,-Wenum-conversion]
        enum intel_combo_mode cb_mode = PHY_PCIE_MODE;
                              ~~~~~~~   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

>From reading the code, it seems that this was not only the
wrong type, but not even supposed to be a code path that can
happen in practice.

Change the code to have no default phy mode but instead return an
error for invalid input.
