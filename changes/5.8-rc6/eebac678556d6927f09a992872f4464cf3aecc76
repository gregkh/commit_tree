crypto: ccp -- don't "select" CONFIG_DMADEVICES

DMADEVICES is the top-level option for the slave DMA
subsystem, and should not be selected by device drivers,
as this can cause circular dependencies such as:

drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:6:error: recursive dependency detected!
drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:6:	symbol NET_VENDOR_FREESCALE depends on PPC_BESTCOMM
drivers/dma/bestcomm/Kconfig:6:	symbol PPC_BESTCOMM depends on DMADEVICES
drivers/dma/Kconfig:6:	symbol DMADEVICES is selected by CRYPTO_DEV_SP_CCP
drivers/crypto/ccp/Kconfig:10:	symbol CRYPTO_DEV_SP_CCP depends on CRYPTO
crypto/Kconfig:16:	symbol CRYPTO is selected by LIBCRC32C
lib/Kconfig:222:	symbol LIBCRC32C is selected by LIQUIDIO
drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/Kconfig:65:	symbol LIQUIDIO depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
drivers/ptp/Kconfig:8:	symbol PTP_1588_CLOCK is implied by FEC
drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:23:	symbol FEC depends on NET_VENDOR_FREESCALE

The LIQUIDIO driver causing this problem is addressed in a
separate patch, but this change is needed to prevent it from
happening again.

Using "depends on DMADEVICES" is what we do for all other
implementations of slave DMA controllers as well.
