drm/i915: Mark concurrent submissions with a weak-dependency

We recorded the dependencies for WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT in order that we could
correctly perform priority inheritance from the parallel branches to the
common trunk. However, for the purpose of timeslicing and reset
handling, the dependency is weak -- as we the pair of requests are
allowed to run in parallel and not in strict succession.

The real significance though is that this allows us to rearrange
groups of WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT linked requests along the single engine, and
so can resolve user level inter-batch scheduling dependencies from user
semaphores.
