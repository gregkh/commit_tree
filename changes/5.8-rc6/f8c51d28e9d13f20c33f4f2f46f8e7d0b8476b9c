Bluetooth: btbcm: Move setting of USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY quirk to hci_bcm.c

btbcm_finalize() is currently only used by UART attached BCM devices.

Move the setting of the USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY quirk, which we only want
for UART attached devices to hci_bcm in preparation for using
btbcm_finalize() for USB attached devices too.
