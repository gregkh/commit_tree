arm64: syscall: Expand the comment about ptrace and syscall(-1)

If a task executes syscall(-1), we intercept this early and force x0 to
be -ENOSYS so that we don't need to distinguish this scenario from one
where the scno is -1 because a tracer wants to skip the system call
using ptrace. With the return value set, the return path is the same as
the skip case.

Although there is a one-line comment noting this in el0_svc_common(), it
misses out most of the detail. Expand the comment to describe a bit more
about what is going on.
