powerpc/ps3: Fix kexec shutdown hang

The ps3_mm_region_destroy() and ps3_mm_vas_destroy() routines
are called very late in the shutdown via kexec's mmu_cleanup_all
routine.  By the time mmu_cleanup_all runs it is too late to use
udbg_printf, and calling it will cause PS3 systems to hang.

Remove all debugging statements from ps3_mm_region_destroy() and
ps3_mm_vas_destroy() and replace any error reporting with calls
to lv1_panic.

With this change builds with 'DEBUG' defined will not cause kexec
reboots to hang, and builds with 'DEBUG' defined or not will end
in lv1_panic if an error is encountered.
