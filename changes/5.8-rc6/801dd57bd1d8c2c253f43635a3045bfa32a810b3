io_uring: cancel by ->task not pid

For an exiting process it tries to cancel all its inflight requests. Use
req->task to match such instead of work.pid. We always have req->task
set, and it will be valid because we're matching only current exiting
task.

Also, remove work.pid and everything related, it's useless now.
