KVM: arm64: Annotate hyp NMI-related functions as __always_inline

The "inline" keyword is a hint for the compiler to inline a function.  The
functions system_uses_irq_prio_masking() and gic_write_pmr() are used by
the code running at EL2 on a non-VHE system, so mark them as
__always_inline to make sure they'll always be part of the .hyp.text
section.

This fixes the following splat when trying to run a VM:

The instruction abort was caused by the code running at EL2 trying to fetch
an instruction which wasn't mapped in the EL2 translation tables. Using
objdump showed the two functions as separate symbols in the .text section.
