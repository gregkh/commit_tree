igc: Fix NFC rules with multicast addresses

Multicast MAC addresses are valid address for NFC rules but
igc_add_mac_filter() is currently rejecting them. In fact, the I225
controller doesn't impose any constraint on the address value so this
patch gets rid of the address validation check in MAC filter APIs.
