clk: meson: meson8b: Make the CCF use the glitch-free VPU mux

The "vpu_0" or "vpu_1" clock trees should not be updated while the
clock is running. Enforce this by setting CLK_SET_RATE_GATE on the
"vpu_0" and "vpu_1" gates. This makes the CCF switch to the "vpu_1"
tree when "vpu_0" is currently active and vice versa, which is exactly
what the vendor driver does when updating the frequency of the VPU
clock.
