drm/amdgpu: reroute VMC and UMD to IH ring 1 for oss v5

[Why]
Due Page faults can easily overwhelm the interrupt handler.
So to make sure that we never lose valuable interrupts on the primary ring
we re-route page faults to IH ring 1.
It also facilitates the recovery page process, since it's already
running from a process context.
This is valid for Arcturus and future Navi generation GPUs.

[How]
Setting IH_CLIENT_CFG_DATA for VMC and UMD IH clients.
