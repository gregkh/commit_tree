RISC-V: Upgrade smp_mb__after_spinlock() to iorw,iorw

While digging through the recent mmiowb preemption issue it came up that
we aren't actually preventing IO from crossing a scheduling boundary.
While it's a bit ugly to overload smp_mb__after_spinlock() with this
behavior, it's what PowerPC is doing so there's some precedent.
