platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Log more information if SCU IPC command fails

Currently we only log an error if the command times out which makes it
hard to figure out the failing command. This changes the driver to log
command and subcommand with the error code which should make debugging
easier. This also allows us to simplify the callers as they don't need
to log these errors themselves.
