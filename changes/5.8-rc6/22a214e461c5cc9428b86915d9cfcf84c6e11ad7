powerpc/watchpoint: Disable all available watchpoints when !dawr_force_enable

Instead of disabling only first watchpoint, disable all available
watchpoints while clearing dawr_force_enable.

Callback function is used only for disabling watchpoint, rename it
to disable_dawrs_cb(). And null_brk parameter is not really required
while disabling watchpoint, remove it.
