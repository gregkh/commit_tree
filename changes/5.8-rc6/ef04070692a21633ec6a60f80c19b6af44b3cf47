iio: adc: adi-axi-adc: add support for AXI ADC IP core

This change adds support for the Analog Devices Generic AXI ADC IP core.
The IP core is used for interfacing with analog-to-digital (ADC) converters
that require either a high-speed serial interface (JESD204B/C) or a source
synchronous parallel interface (LVDS/CMOS).

Usually, some other interface type (i.e SPI) is used as a control interface
for the actual ADC, while the IP core (controlled via this driver), will
interface to the data-lines of the ADC and handle  the streaming of data
into memory via DMA.

Because of this, the AXI ADC driver needs the other SPI-ADC driver to
register with it. The SPI-ADC needs to be register via the SPI framework,
while the AXI ADC registers as a platform driver. The two cannot be ordered
in a hierarchy as both drivers have their own registers, and trying to
organize this [in a hierarchy becomes] problematic when trying to map
memory/registers.

There are some modes where the AXI ADC can operate as standalone ADC, but
those will be implemented at a later point in time.
