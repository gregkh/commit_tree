x86/hyper-v: Add synthetic debugger definitions

Hyper-V synthetic debugger has two modes, one that uses MSRs and
the other that use Hypercalls.

Add all the required definitions to both types of synthetic debugger
interface.

Some of the required new CPUIDs and MSRs are not documented in the TLFS
so they are in hyperv.h instead.

The reason they are not documented is because they are subjected to be
removed in future versions of Windows.
