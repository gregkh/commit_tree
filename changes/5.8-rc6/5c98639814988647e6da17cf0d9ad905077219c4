MAINTAINERS: reorder media attributes

Some media entry attributes got out of the order after the
bug was split into 3. Also, as reported by Johan, the
Rockchip VPU entry also had their attributes at the wrong
order.

As those entries weren't merged yet upstream, let's reorder
them with:

	./scripts/parse-maintainers.pl --input=MAINTAINERS --output=MAINTAINERS --order
