selftests/bpf: Test updating flow_dissector link with same program

This case, while not particularly useful, is worth covering because we
expect the operation to succeed as opposed when re-attaching the same
program directly with PROG_ATTACH.

While at it, update the tests summary that fell out of sync when tests
extended to cover links.
