iwlwifi: use longer queues for 256-BA

When we have 256 block-ack support, we may need to be very fast
to provide a lot of frames to the hardware to transmit, but that
cannot be guaranteed. Use a longer queue size to have more time,
and the next possible queue size is 1024 since it must be a power
of two.
