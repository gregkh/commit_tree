ovl: check permission to open real file

Call inode_permission() on real inode before opening regular file on one of
the underlying layers.

In some cases ovl_permission() already checks access to an underlying file,
but it misses the metacopy case, and possibly other ones as well.

Removing the redundant permission check from ovl_permission() should be
considered later.
