net/smc: rkey processing for a new link as SMC client

Part of the SMC client new link establishment process is the exchange of
rkeys for all used buffers.
Add new LLC message type ADD_LINK_CONTINUE which is used to exchange
rkeys of all current RMB buffers. Add functions to iterate over all
used RMB buffers of the link group, and implement the ADD_LINK_CONTINUE
processing.
