PCI/ASPM: Allow ASPM on links to PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X Bridges

7d715a6c1ae5 ("PCI: add PCI Express ASPM support") added the ability for
Linux to enable ASPM, but for some undocumented reason, it didn't enable
ASPM on links where the downstream component is a PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X Bridge.

Remove this exclusion so we can enable ASPM on these links.

The Dell OptiPlex 7080 mentioned in the bugzilla has a TI XIO2001
PCIe-to-PCI Bridge.  Enabling ASPM on the link leading to it allows the
Intel SoC to enter deeper Package C-states, which is a significant power
savings.
