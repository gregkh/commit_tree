ALSA: firewire-lib: add reference to domain structure from stream structure

In current implementation, AMDTP domain structure and AMDTP stream
structure has one way of reference from the former to the latter. For
future extension, bidirectional reference is needed.

This commit adds a member into stream structure to refer to domain
structure to which the stream belongs.
