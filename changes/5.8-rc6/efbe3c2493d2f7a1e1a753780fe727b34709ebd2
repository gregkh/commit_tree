fs: Remove unneeded IS_DAX() check in io_is_direct()

Remove the check because DAX now has it's own read/write methods and
file systems which support DAX check IS_DAX() prior to IOCB_DIRECT on
their own.  Therefore, it does not matter if the file state is DAX when
the iocb flags are created.

Also remove io_is_direct() as it is just a simple flag check.
