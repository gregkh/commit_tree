gfs2: eliminate GIF_ORDERED in favor of list_empty

In several places, we used the GIF_ORDERED inode flag to determine
if an inode was on the ordered writes list. However, since we always
held the sd_ordered_lock spin_lock during the manipulation, we can
just as easily check list_empty(&ip->i_ordered) instead.
This allows us to keep more than one ordered writes list to make
journal writing improvements.

This patch eliminates GIF_ORDERED in favor of checking list_empty.
