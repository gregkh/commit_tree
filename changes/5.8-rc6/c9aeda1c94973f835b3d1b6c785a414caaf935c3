ASoC: mmp-sspa: Get rid of dma_params and phys_base

This makes things simpler. There's no reason not to just embed the struct
snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data in struct sspa_priv and do away with an
unnecessary kmalloc(). While at that, we can initialize the
snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data structures earlier.

Let's also stop offsetting the source/destination of the DMA transfer by
phys_base. Firstly, it's never set and is always zero. Secondly, the
hardware actually ignores it, at least on a MMP2 and MMP3.
