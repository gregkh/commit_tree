sparc32: mm: Don't try to free page-table pages if ctor() fails

The pages backing page-table allocations for SRMMU are allocated via
memblock as part of the "nocache" region initialisation during
srmmu_paging_init() and should not be freed even if a later call to
pgtable_pte_page_ctor() fails.

Remove the broken call to __free_page().
