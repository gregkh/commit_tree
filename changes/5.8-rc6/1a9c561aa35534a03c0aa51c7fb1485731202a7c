ice: fix PCI device serial number to be lowercase values

Commit ceb2f00707f9 ("ice: Use pci_get_dsn()") changed the code to
use a new function to get the Device Serial Number. It also changed
the case of the filename for loading a package on a specific NIC
from lowercase to uppercase. Change the filename back to
lowercase since that is what we specified.
