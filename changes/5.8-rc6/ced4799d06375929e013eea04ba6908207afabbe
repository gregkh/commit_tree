net: macb: mark device wake capable when "magic-packet" property present

Change the way the "magic-packet" DT property is handled in the
macb_probe() function, matching DT binding documentation.
Now we mark the device as "wakeup capable" instead of calling the
device_init_wakeup() function that would enable the wakeup source.

For Ethernet WoL, enabling the wakeup_source is done by
using ethtool and associated macb_set_wol() function that
already calls device_set_wakeup_enable() for this purpose.

That would reduce power consumption by cutting more clocks if
"magic-packet" property is set but WoL is not configured by ethtool.
