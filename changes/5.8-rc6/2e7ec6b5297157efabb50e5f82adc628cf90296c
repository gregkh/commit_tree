drm/msm/dpu: allow initialization of encoder locks during encoder init

In the current implementation, mutex initialization
for encoder mutex locks are done during encoder
setup. This can lead to scenarios where the lock
is used before it is initialized. Move mutex_init
to dpu_encoder_init to avoid this.
