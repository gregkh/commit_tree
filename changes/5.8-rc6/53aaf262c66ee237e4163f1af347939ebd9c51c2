x86/idtentry: Provide macros to define/declare IDT entry points

Provide DECLARE/DEFINE_IDTENTRY() macros.

DEFINE_IDTENTRY() provides a wrapper which acts as the function
definition. The exception handler body is just appended to it with curly
brackets. The entry point is marked noinstr so that irq tracing and the
enter_from_user_mode() can be moved into the C-entry point. As all
C-entries use the same macro (or a later variant) the necessary entry
handling can be implemented at one central place.

DECLARE_IDTENTRY() provides the function prototypes:
  - The C entry point 	    	cfunc
  - The ASM entry point		asm_cfunc
  - The XEN/PV entry point	xen_asm_cfunc

They all follow the same naming convention.

When included from ASM code DECLARE_IDTENTRY() is a macro which emits the
low level entry point in assembly by instantiating idtentry.

IDTENTRY is the simplest variant which just has a pt_regs argument. It's
going to be used for all exceptions which have no error code.
