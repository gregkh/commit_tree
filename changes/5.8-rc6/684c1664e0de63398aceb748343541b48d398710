powerpc/8xx: Always pin TLBs at startup.

At startup, map 32 Mbytes of memory through 4 pages of 8M,
and PIN them inconditionnaly. They need to be pinned because
KASAN is using page tables early and the TLBs might be
dynamically replaced otherwise.

Remove RSV4I flag after installing mappings unless
CONFIG_PIN_TLB_XXXX is selected.
