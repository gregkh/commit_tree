drm/virtio: fix OOB in virtio_gpu_object_create

After commit f651c8b05542 ("drm/virtio: factor out the sg_table from
virtio_gpu_object"), virtio_gpu_create_object allocates too small space
to fit everything in. It is because it allocates struct
virtio_gpu_object, but should allocate a newly added struct
virtio_gpu_object_shmem which has 2 more members.

So fix that by using correct type in virtio_gpu_create_object.
