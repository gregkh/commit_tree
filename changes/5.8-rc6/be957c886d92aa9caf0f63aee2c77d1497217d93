mm/hmm: make hmm_range_fault return 0 or -1

hmm_vma_walk->last is supposed to be updated after every write to the
pfns, so that it can be returned by hmm_range_fault(). However, this is
not done consistently. Fortunately nothing checks the return code of
hmm_range_fault() for anything other than error.

More importantly last must be set before returning -EBUSY as it is used to
prevent reading an output pfn as an input flags when the loop restarts.

For clarity and simplicity make hmm_range_fault() return 0 or -ERRNO. Only
set last when returning -EBUSY.
