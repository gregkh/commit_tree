ASoC: SOF: topology: fix: handle DAI widget connections properly with multiple CPU DAI's

Currently, when connecting a DAI widget to the BE CPU DAI, we overwrite
the previous connections. This worked because we only ever had 1 CPU DAI
for each rtd until now. But with multiple CPU DAI's, a new connection
between a BE CPU DAI and the DAI widget should be established without
affecting the previous connections. So, modify the loop to set the
playback/capture widget for the first BE CPU DAI that does not have a
connection established previously.

cpu-dais")
