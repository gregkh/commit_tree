selinux: Implement the watch_key security hook

Implement the watch_key security hook to make sure that a key grants the
caller View permission in order to set a watch on a key.

For the moment, the watch_devices security hook is left unimplemented as
it's not obvious what the object should be since the queue is global and
didn't previously exist.
