drivers: drm: panel: Add ASUS TM5P5 NT35596 panel driver

This adds support for TMP5P5 NT35596 1080x1920 video
mode panel that can be found on some Asus Zenfone 2
Laser (Z00T) devices.

This panel seems to only be found in this device
and we have no straightforward way of actually
getting the correct model number, as no schematics
are released publicly.
