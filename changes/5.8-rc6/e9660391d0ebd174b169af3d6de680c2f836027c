x86/doublefault: Remove memmove() call

Use of memmove() in #DF is problematic considered tracing and other
instrumentation.

Remove the memmove() call and simply write out what needs doing; this
even clarifies the code, win-win! The code copies from the espfix64
stack to the normal task stack, there is no possible way for that to
overlap.

Survives selftests/x86, specifically sigreturn_64.
