ath10k: remove the max_sched_scan_reqs value

The struct cfg80211_wowlan of NET_DETECT WoWLAN feature share the same
struct cfg80211_sched_scan_request together with scheduled scan request
feature, and max_sched_scan_reqs of wiphy is only used for sched scan,
and ath10k does not support scheduled scan request feature, so ath10k
does not set flag NL80211_FEATURE_SCHED_SCAN_RANDOM_MAC_ADDR, but ath10k
set max_sched_scan_reqs of wiphy to a non zero value 1, then function
nl80211_add_commands_unsplit of cfg80211 will set it support command
NL80211_CMD_START_SCHED_SCAN because max_sched_scan_reqs is a non zero
value, but actually ath10k not support it, then it leads a mismatch result
for sched scan of cfg80211, then application shill found the mismatch and
stop running case of MAC random address scan and then the case fail.

After remove max_sched_scan_reqs value, it keeps match for sched scan and
case of MAC random address scan pass.

Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00029.
Tested with QCA6174 PCIe with firmware WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00110-QCARMSWP-1.
