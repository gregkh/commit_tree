io_uring: fix overflowed reqs cancellation

Overflowed requests in io_uring_cancel_files() should be shed only of
inflight and overflowed refs. All other left references are owned by
someone else.

If refcount_sub_and_test() fails, it will go further and put put extra
ref, don't do that. Also, don't need to do io_wq_cancel_work()
for overflowed reqs, they will be let go shortly anyway.
