usb: dwc3: meson-g12a: refactor usb init

Refactor the USB init code patch to handle the Amlogic GXL/GXM needing
to initialize the OTG port as Peripheral mode for the DWC2 IP to probe
correctly.

A secondary, post_init callback is added to setup the OTG PHY mode after
powering up the PHYs and before probing the DWC2 and DWC3 controllers.
