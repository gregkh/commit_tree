remove the no longer needed pid_alive() check in __task_pid_nr_ns()

Starting from 2c4704756cab ("pids: Move the pgrp and session pid pointers
from task_struct to signal_struct") __task_pid_nr_ns() doesn't dereference
task->group_leader, we can remove the pid_alive() check.

pid_nr_ns() has to check pid != NULL anyway, pid_alive() just adds the
unnecessary confusion.
