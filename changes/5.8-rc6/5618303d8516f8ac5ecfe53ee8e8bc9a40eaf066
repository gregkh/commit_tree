cifs: update ctime and mtime during truncate

As the man description of the truncate, if the size changed,
then the st_ctime and st_mtime fields should be updated. But
in cifs, we doesn't do it.

It lead the xfstests generic/313 failed.

So, add the ATTR_MTIME|ATTR_CTIME flags on attrs when change
the file size
