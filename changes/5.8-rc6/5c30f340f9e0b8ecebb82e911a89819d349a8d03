mmc: host: sdhci-msm: Configure dll-user-control in dll init sequence

With SDCC v5.1.0, additional setting needed for enabling DLL output.
The dll-user-control register need to be configured during dll
initialization for getting proper dll output.

Without this configuration, we don't get the DLL lock status properly.
Also update the DLL register settings according to the SDCC Hardware
Programming Guide.
