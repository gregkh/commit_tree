bpf: Selftests, sockmap test prog run without setting cgroup

Running test_sockmap with arguments to specify a test pattern requires
including a cgroup argument. Instead of requiring this if the option is
not provided create one

This is not used by selftest runs but I use it when I want to test a
specific test. Most useful when developing new code and/or tests.
