KVM: arm64: PMU: Fix per-CPU access in preemptible context

Commit 07da1ffaa137 ("KVM: arm64: Remove host_cpu_context
member from vcpu structure") has, by removing the host CPU
context pointer, exposed that kvm_vcpu_pmu_restore_guest
is called in preemptible contexts:

Note that the bug was always there, it is only the switch to
using percpu accessors that made it obvious.
The fix is to wrap these accesses in a preempt-disabled section,
so that we sample a coherent context on trap from the guest.
