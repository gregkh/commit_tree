include: dt-bindings: rockchip: remove unused defines

The Rockchip dtsi and dts files have been bulk-converted for the
remaining raw gpio numbers into their descriptive counterparts and
also got rid of the unhelpful RK_FUNC_x -> x and RK_GPIOx -> x
mappings, so remove the unused defines in 'rockchip.h' to prevent
that someone start using them again.
