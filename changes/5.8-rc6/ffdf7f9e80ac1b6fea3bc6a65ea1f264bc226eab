KVM: nSVM: extract svm_set_gif

Extract the code that is needed to implement CLGI and STGI,
so that we can run it from VMRUN and vmexit (and in the future,
KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE).  Skip the request for KVM_REQ_EVENT unless needed,
subsuming the evaluate_pending_interrupts optimization that is found
in enter_svm_guest_mode.
