drm/managed: Fix off-by-one in warning

I'm thinking this is the warning that fired in the 0day report, but I
can't double-check yet since 0day didn't upload its source tree
anywhere I can check. And all the drivers I can easily test don't use
drm_dev_alloc anymore ...

Also if I'm correct supreme amounts of bad luck because usually kslap
(for bigger structures) gives us something quite a bit bigger than
what we asked for.

[0day uploaded tree, guess is correct]
