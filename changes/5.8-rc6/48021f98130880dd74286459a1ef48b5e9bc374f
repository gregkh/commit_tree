printk: handle blank console arguments passed in.

If uboot passes a blank string to console_setup then it results in
a trashed memory. Ultimately, the kernel crashes during freeing up
the memory.

This fix checks if there is a blank parameter being
passed to console_setup from uboot. In case it detects that
the console parameter is blank then it doesn't setup the serial
device and it gracefully exits.
