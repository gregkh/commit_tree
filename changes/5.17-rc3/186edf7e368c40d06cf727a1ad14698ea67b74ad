selinux: fix double free of cond_list on error paths

On error path from cond_read_list() and duplicate_policydb_cond_list()
the cond_list_destroy() gets called a second time in caller functions,
resulting in NULL pointer deref.  Fix this by resetting the
cond_list_len to 0 in cond_list_destroy(), making subsequent calls a
noop.

Also consistently reset the cond_list pointer to NULL after freeing.
