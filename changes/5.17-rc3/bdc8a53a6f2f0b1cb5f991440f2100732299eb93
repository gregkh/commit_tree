ext4: fast commit may miss file actions

in the follow scenario:
1. jbd start transaction n
2. task A get new handle for transaction n+1
3. task A do some actions and add inode to FC_Q_MAIN fc_q
4. jbd complete transaction n and clear FC_Q_MAIN fc_q
5. task A call fsync

Fast commit will lost the file actions during a full commit.

we should also add updates to staging queue during a full commit.
and in ext4_fc_cleanup(), when reset a inode's fc track range, check
it's i_sync_tid, if it bigger than current transaction tid, do not
rest it, or we will lost the track range.

And EXT4_MF_FC_COMMITTING is not needed anymore, so drop it.
