netfilter: nft_reject_bridge: Fix for missing reply from prerouting

Prior to commit fa538f7cf05aa ("netfilter: nf_reject: add reject skbuff
creation helpers"), nft_reject_bridge did not assign to nskb->dev before
passing nskb on to br_forward(). The shared skbuff creation helpers
introduced in above commit do which seems to confuse br_forward() as
reject statements in prerouting hook won't emit a packet anymore.

Fix this by simply passing NULL instead of 'dev' to the helpers - they
use the pointer for just that assignment, nothing else.
