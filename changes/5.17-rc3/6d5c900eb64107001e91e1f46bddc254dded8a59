net/mlx5e: Use struct_group() for memcpy() region

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Use struct_group() in struct vlan_ethhdr around members h_dest and
h_source, so they can be referenced together. This will allow memcpy()
and sizeof() to more easily reason about sizes, improve readability,
and avoid future warnings about writing beyond the end of h_dest.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct vlan_ethhdr.
"objdump -d" shows no object code changes.
