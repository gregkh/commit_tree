pinctrl: cherryview: Trigger hwirq0 for interrupt-lines without a mapping

Commit bdfbef2d29dc ("pinctrl: cherryview: Don't use selection 0 to mark
an interrupt line as unused") made the code properly differentiate
between unset vs (hwirq) 0 entries in the GPIO-controller interrupt-line
to GPIO pinnumber/hwirq mapping.

This is causing some boards to not boot. This commit restores the old
behavior of triggering hwirq 0 when receiving an interrupt on an
interrupt-line for which there is no mapping.
