ASoC: soc-pcm: Move debugfs removal out of spinlock

The recent fix for DPCM locking also covered the loop in
dpcm_be_disconnect() with the FE stream lock.  This caused an
unexpected side effect, thought: calling debugfs_remove_recursive() in
the spinlock may lead to lockdep splats as the code there assumes the
SOFTIRQ-safe context.

For avoiding the problem, this patch changes the disconnection
procedure to two phases: at first, the matching entries are removed
from the linked list, then the resources are freed outside the lock.
