xfs: set prealloc flag in xfs_alloc_file_space()

Now that we only call xfs_update_prealloc_flags() from
xfs_file_fallocate() in the case where we need to set the
preallocation flag, do this in xfs_alloc_file_space() where we
already have the inode joined into a transaction and get
rid of the call to xfs_update_prealloc_flags() from the fallocate
code.

This also means that we now correctly avoid setting the
XFS_DIFLAG_PREALLOC flag when xfs_is_always_cow_inode() is true, as
these inodes will never have preallocated extents.
