ASoC: codecs: lpass-rx-macro: fix sidetone register offsets

For some reason we ended up with incorrect register offfset calcuations
for sidetone. regmap clearly throw errors when accessing these incorrect
registers as these do not belong to any read/write ranges.
so fix them to point to correct register offsets.
