spi: mediatek: Avoid NULL pointer crash in interrupt

In some case, like after a transfer timeout, master->cur_msg pointer
is NULL which led to a kernel crash when trying to use master->cur_msg->spi.
mtk_spi_can_dma(), pointed by master->can_dma, doesn't use this parameter
avoid the problem by setting NULL as second parameter.
