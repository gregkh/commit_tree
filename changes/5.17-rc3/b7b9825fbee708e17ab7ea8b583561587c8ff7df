tools headers UAPI: Sync linux/kvm.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  f6c6804c43fa18d3 ("kvm: Move KVM_GET_XSAVE2 IOCTL definition at the end of kvm.h")

That just rebuilds perf, as these patches don't add any new KVM ioctl to
be harvested for the the 'perf trace' ioctl syscall argument
beautifiers.

This is also by now used by tools/testing/selftests/kvm/, a simple test
build succeeded.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h include/uapi/linux/kvm.h
