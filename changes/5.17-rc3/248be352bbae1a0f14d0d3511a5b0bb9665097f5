ASoC: amd: acp-mach: Fix Left and Right rt1019 amp devices

We're setting wrong card codec conf for rt1019 amp devices in our
machine driver. Due to this left and right amp channels data are
reversed in our machines as wrong device prefix results in wrong
value for "Mono LR Select" rt1019 mixer control. Reverse dev ids
in codec conf with Left and Right name_prefix to fix such issue.
