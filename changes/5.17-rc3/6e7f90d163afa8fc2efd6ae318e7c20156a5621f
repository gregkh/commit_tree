lockd: fix server crash on reboot of client holding lock

I thought I was iterating over the array when actually the iteration is
over the values contained in the array?

Ugh, keep it simple.

Symptoms were a null deference in vfs_lock_file() when an NFSv3 client
that previously held a lock came back up and sent a notify.
