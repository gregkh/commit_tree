scsi: hisi_sas: Fix setting of hisi_sas_slot.is_internal

The hisi_sas_slot.is_internal member is not set properly for ATA commands
which the driver sends directly. A TMF struct pointer is normally used as a
test to set this, but it is NULL for those commands. It's not ideal, but
pass an empty TMF struct to set that member properly.
