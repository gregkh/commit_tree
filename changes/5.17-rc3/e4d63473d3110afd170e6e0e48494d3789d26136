spi: stm32-qspi: Update spi registering

Some device driver need to communicate to qspi device during the remove
process, qspi controller must be functional when spi_unregister_master()
is called.

To ensure this, replace devm_spi_register_master() by spi_register_master()
and spi_unregister_master() is called directly in .remove callback before
stopping the qspi controller.

This issue was put in evidence using kernel v5.11 and later
with a spi-nor which supports the software reset feature introduced
by commit d73ee7534cc5 ("mtd: spi-nor: core: perform a Soft Reset on
shutdown")

Fixes: c530cd1d9d5e ("spi: spi-mem: add stm32 qspi controller")
