ext4: fix error handling in ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()

Current code does not fully takes care of krealloc() error case, which
could lead to silent memory corruption or a kernel bug.  This patch
fixes that.

Also it cleans up some duplicated error handling logic from various
functions in fast_commit.c file.
