ipheth: fix EOVERFLOW in ipheth_rcvbulk_callback

When rx_buf is allocated we need to account for IPHETH_IP_ALIGN,
which reduces the usable size by 2 bytes. Otherwise we have 1512
bytes usable instead of 1514, and if we receive more than 1512
bytes, ipheth_rcvbulk_callback is called with status -EOVERFLOW,
after which the driver malfunctiones and all communication stops.

Resolves ipheth 2-1:4.2: ipheth_rcvbulk_callback: urb status: -75
