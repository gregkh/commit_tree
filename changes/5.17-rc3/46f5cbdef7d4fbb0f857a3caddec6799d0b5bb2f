cifs: Fix the readahead conversion to manage the batch when reading from cache

Fix the readahead conversion to correctly manage the last batch skipping
when reading from cache.  This involves a readahead batch of one page or
one folio, so set the batch size according to the number of constituent
pages (should be 1 for a filesystem that doesn't do multipage folios yet).
