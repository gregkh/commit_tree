platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Add support for disabling ACPI _AEI handlers

Some of the broken DSDTs on these devices often also include broken / wrong
_AEI (ACPI Event Interrupt) handlers, which can cause e.g. interrupt storms
by listening to a floating GPIO pin.

Add support for disabling these and disable them on the Asus ME176C and
TF103C tablets.
