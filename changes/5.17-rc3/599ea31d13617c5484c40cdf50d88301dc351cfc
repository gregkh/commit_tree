ext4: prevent used blocks from being allocated during fast commit replay

During fast commit replay procedure, we clear inode blocks bitmap in
ext4_ext_clear_bb(), this may cause ext4_mb_new_blocks_simple() allocate
blocks still in use.

Make ext4_fc_record_regions() also record physical disk regions used by
inodes during replay procedure. Then ext4_mb_new_blocks_simple() can
excludes these blocks in use.
