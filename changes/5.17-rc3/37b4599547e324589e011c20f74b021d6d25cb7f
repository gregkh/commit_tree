btrfs: fix use of uninitialized variable at rm device ioctl

Clang static analysis reports this problem
ioctl.c:3333:8: warning: 3rd function call argument is an
  uninitialized value
    ret = exclop_start_or_cancel_reloc(fs_info,

cancel is only set in one branch of an if-check and is always used.  So
initialize to false.
