RDMA/mlx4: Don't continue event handler after memory allocation failure

The failure to allocate memory during MLX4_DEV_EVENT_PORT_MGMT_CHANGE
event handler will cause skip the assignment logic, but
ib_dispatch_event() will be called anyway.

Fix it by calling to return instead of break after memory allocation
failure.
