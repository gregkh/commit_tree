drm/i915/pmu: Use PM timestamp instead of RING TIMESTAMP for reference

All timestamps returned by GuC for GuC PMU busyness are captured from
GUC PM TIMESTAMP. Since this timestamp does not tick when GuC goes idle,
kmd uses RING_TIMESTAMP to measure busyness of an engine with an active
context. In further stress testing, the MMIO read of the RING_TIMESTAMP
is seen to cause a rare hang. Resolve the issue by using gt specific
timestamp from PM which is in sync with the GuC PM timestamp.
