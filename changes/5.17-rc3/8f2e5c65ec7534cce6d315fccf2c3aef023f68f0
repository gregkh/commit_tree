ASoC: qdsp6: q6apm-dai: only stop graphs that are started

Its possible that the sound card is just opened and closed without actually
playing stream, ex: if the audio file itself is missing.

Even in such cases we do call stop on graphs that are not yet started.
DSP can throw errors in such cases, so add a check to see if the graph
was started before stopping it.
