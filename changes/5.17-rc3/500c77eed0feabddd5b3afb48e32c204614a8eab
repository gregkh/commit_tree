pinctrl: zynqmp: Revert "Unify pin naming"

This reverts commit 54784ff24971ed5bd3f1056edce998148709d0a7.

This patch changes the pin names from "MIO%d" to "MIO-%d", but all dts
in arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx still use the old name. As a result my
ZCU104 has no output on serial terminal and is not reachable over
network.
