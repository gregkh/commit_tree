The current implementation of gntdev guarantees that the first call to
IOCTL_GNTDEV_MAP_GRANT_REF will set @index to 0.  This is required to
use gntdev for Wayland, which is a future desire of Qubes OS.
Additionally, requesting zero grants results in an error, but this was
not documented either.  Document both of these.
