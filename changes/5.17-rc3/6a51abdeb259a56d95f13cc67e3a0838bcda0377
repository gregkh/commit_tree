nvme-fabrics: fix state check in nvmf_ctlr_matches_baseopts()

Controller deletion/reset, immediately followed by or concurrent with
a reconnect, is hard failing the connect attempt resulting in a
complete loss of connectivity to the controller.

In the connect request, fabrics looks for an existing controller with
the same address components and aborts the connect if a controller
already exists and the duplicate connect option isn't set. The match
routine filters out controllers that are dead or dying, so they don't
interfere with the new connect request.

When NVME_CTRL_DELETING_NOIO was added, it missed updating the state
filters in the nvmf_ctlr_matches_baseopts() routine. Thus, when in this
new state, it's seen as a live controller and fails the connect request.

Correct by adding the DELETING_NIO state to the match checks.
