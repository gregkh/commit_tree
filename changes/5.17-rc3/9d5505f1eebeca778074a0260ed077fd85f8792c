random: only call crng_finalize_init() for primary_crng

crng_finalize_init() returns instantly if it is called for another pool
than primary_crng. The test whether crng_finalize_init() is still required
can be moved to the relevant caller in crng_reseed(), and
crng_need_final_init can be reset to false if crng_finalize_init() is
called with workqueues ready. Then, no previous callsite will call
crng_finalize_init() unless it is needed, and we can get rid of the
superfluous function parameter.
