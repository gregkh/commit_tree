PCI/MSI: Remove bogus warning in pci_irq_get_affinity()

The recent overhaul of pci_irq_get_affinity() introduced a regression when
pci_irq_get_affinity() is called for an MSI-X interrupt which was not
allocated with affinity descriptor information.

The original code just returned a NULL pointer in that case, but the rework
added a WARN_ON() under the assumption that the corresponding WARN_ON() in
the MSI case can be applied to MSI-X as well.

In fact the MSI warning in the original code does not make sense either
because it's legitimate to invoke pci_irq_get_affinity() for a MSI
interrupt which was not allocated with affinity descriptor information.

Remove it and just return NULL as the original code did.
