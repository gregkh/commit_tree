KVM: arm64: Workaround Cortex-A510's single-step and PAC trap errata

Cortex-A510's erratum #2077057 causes SPSR_EL2 to be corrupted when
single-stepping authenticated ERET instructions. A single step is
expected, but a pointer authentication trap is taken instead. The
erratum causes SPSR_EL1 to be copied to SPSR_EL2, which could allow
EL1 to cause a return to EL2 with a guest controlled ELR_EL2.

Because the conditions require an ERET into active-not-pending state,
this is only a problem for the EL2 when EL2 is stepping EL1. In this case
the previous SPSR_EL2 value is preserved in struct kvm_vcpu, and can be
restored.
