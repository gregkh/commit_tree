platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Fix incorrect use of platform profile on AMD platforms

Lenovo AMD based platforms have been offering platform_profiles but they
are not working correctly. This is because the mode we are using on the
Intel platforms (MMC) is not available on the AMD platforms.

This commit adds checking of the functional capabilities returned by the
BIOS to confirm if MMC is supported or not. Profiles will not be
available if the platform is not MMC capable.

I'm investigating and working on an alternative for AMD platforms but
that is still work-in-progress.
