mm/pgtable: define pte_index so that preprocessor could recognize it

Since commit 974b9b2c68f3 ("mm: consolidate pte_index() and
pte_offset_*() definitions") pte_index is a static inline and there is
no define for it that can be recognized by the preprocessor.  As a
result, vm_insert_pages() uses slower loop over vm_insert_page() instead
of insert_pages() that amortizes the cost of spinlock operations when
inserting multiple pages.
