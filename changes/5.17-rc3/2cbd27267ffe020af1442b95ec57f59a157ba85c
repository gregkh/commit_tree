spi: bcm-qspi: check for valid cs before applying chip select

Apply only valid chip select value. This change fixes case where chip
select is set to initial value of '-1' during probe and  PM supend and
subsequent resume can try to use the value with undefined behaviour.
Also in case where gpio based chip select, the check in
bcm_qspi_chip_select() shall prevent undefined behaviour on resume.
