selftests: netfilter: check stateless nat udp checksum fixup

Add a test that sends large udp packet (which is fragmented)
via a stateless nft nat rule, i.e. 'ip saddr set 10.2.3.4'
and check that the datagram is received by peer.

On kernels without
commit 4e1860a38637 ("netfilter: nft_payload: do not update layer 4 checksum when mangling fragments")',
this will fail with:

cmp: EOF on /tmp/tmp.V1q0iXJyQF which is empty
-rw------- 1 root root 4096 Jan 24 22:03 /tmp/tmp.Aaqnq4rBKS
-rw------- 1 root root    0 Jan 24 22:03 /tmp/tmp.V1q0iXJyQF
ERROR: in and output file mismatch when checking udp with stateless nat
FAIL: nftables v1.0.0 (Fearless Fosdick #2)

On patched kernels, this will show:
PASS: IP statless for ns2-PFp89amx
