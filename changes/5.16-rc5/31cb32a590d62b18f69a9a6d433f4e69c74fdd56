can: m_can: m_can_read_fifo: fix memory leak in error branch

In m_can_read_fifo(), if the second call to m_can_fifo_read() fails,
the function jump to the out_fail label and returns without calling
m_can_receive_skb(). This means that the skb previously allocated by
alloc_can_skb() is not freed. In other terms, this is a memory leak.

This patch adds a goto label to destroy the skb if an error occurs.

Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for
details.
