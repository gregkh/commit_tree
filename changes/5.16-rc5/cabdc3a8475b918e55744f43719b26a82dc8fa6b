sched,x86: Don't use cluster topology for x86 hybrid CPUs

For x86 hybrid CPUs like Alder Lake, the order of CPU selection should
be based strictly on CPU priority.  Don't include cluster topology for
hybrid CPUs to avoid interference with such CPU selection order.

On Alder Lake, the Atom CPU cluster has more capacity (4 Atom CPUs) vs
Big core cluster (2 hyperthread CPUs). This could potentially bias CPU
selection towards Atom over Big Core, when Big core CPU has higher
priority.
