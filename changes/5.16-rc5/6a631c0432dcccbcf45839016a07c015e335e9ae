Documentation/locking/locktypes: Update migrate_disable() bits.

The initial implementation of migrate_disable() for mainline was a
wrapper around preempt_disable(). RT kernels substituted this with
a real migrate disable implementation.

Later on mainline gained true migrate disable support, but the
documentation was not updated.

Update the documentation, remove the claims about migrate_disable()
mapping to preempt_disable() on non-PREEMPT_RT kernels.

Fixes: 74d862b682f51 ("sched: Make migrate_disable/enable() independent of RT")
