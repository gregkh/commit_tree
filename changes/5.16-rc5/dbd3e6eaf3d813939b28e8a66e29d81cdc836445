hwmon: (dell-smm) Fix warning on /proc/i8k creation error

The removal function is called regardless of whether
/proc/i8k was created successfully or not, the later
causing a WARN() on module removal.
Fix that by only registering the removal function
if /proc/i8k was created successfully.

Tested on a Inspiron 3505.
