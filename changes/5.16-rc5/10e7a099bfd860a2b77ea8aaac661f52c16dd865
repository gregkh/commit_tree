selftests: KVM: Add test to verify KVM doesn't explode on "bad" I/O

Add an x86 selftest to verify that KVM doesn't WARN or otherwise explode
if userspace modifies RCX during a userspace exit to handle string I/O.
This is a regression test for a user-triggerable WARN introduced by
commit 3b27de271839 ("KVM: x86: split the two parts of emulator_pio_in").
