vmxnet3: fix minimum vectors alloc issue

'Commit 39f9895a00f4 ("vmxnet3: add support for 32 Tx/Rx queues")'
added support for 32Tx/Rx queues. Within that patch, value of
VMXNET3_LINUX_MIN_MSIX_VECT was updated.

However, there is a case (numvcpus = 2) which actually requires 3
intrs which matches VMXNET3_LINUX_MIN_MSIX_VECT which then is
treated as failure by stack to allocate more vectors. This patch
fixes this issue.
