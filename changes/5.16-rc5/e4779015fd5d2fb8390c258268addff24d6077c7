timers: implement usleep_idle_range()

Patch series "mm/damon: Fix fake /proc/loadavg reports", v3.

This patchset fixes DAMON's fake load report issue.  The first patch
makes yet another variant of usleep_range() for this fix, and the second
patch fixes the issue of DAMON by making it using the newly introduced
function.

This patch (of 2):

Some kernel threads such as DAMON could need to repeatedly sleep in
micro seconds level.  Because usleep_range() sleeps in uninterruptible
state, however, such threads would make /proc/loadavg reports fake load.

To help such cases, this commit implements a variant of usleep_range()
called usleep_idle_range().  It is same to usleep_range() but sets the
state of the current task as TASK_IDLE while sleeping.
