HID: add hid_is_usb() function to make it simpler for USB detection

A number of HID drivers already call hid_is_using_ll_driver() but only
for the detection of if this is a USB device or not.  Make this more
obvious by creating hid_is_usb() and calling the function that way.

Also converts the existing hid_is_using_ll_driver() functions to use the
new call.
