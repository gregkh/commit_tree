perf bpf: Fix building perf with BUILD_BPF_SKEL=1 by default in more distros

Arnaldo reported that building all his containers with BUILD_BPF_SKEL=1
to then make this the default he found problems in some distros where
the system linux/bpf.h file was being used and lacked this:

   util/bpf_skel/bperf_leader.bpf.c:13:20: error: use of undeclared identifier 'BPF_F_PRESERVE_ELEMS'
           __uint(map_flags, BPF_F_PRESERVE_ELEMS);

So use instead the vmlinux.h file generated by bpftool from BTF info.

This fixed these as well, getting the build back working on debian:11,
debian:experimental and ubuntu:21.10:
