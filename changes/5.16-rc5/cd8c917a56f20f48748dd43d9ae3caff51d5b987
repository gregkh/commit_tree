Makefile: Do not quote value for CONFIG_CC_IMPLICIT_FALLTHROUGH

Andreas reported that a specific build environment for an external
module, being a bit broken, does pass CC_IMPLICIT_FALLTHROUGH quoted as
argument to gcc, causing an error

  gcc-11: error: "-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5": linker input file not found: No such file or directory

Until this is more generally fixed as outlined in [1], by fixing
scripts/link-vmlinux.sh, scripts/gen_autoksyms.sh, etc to not directly
include the include/config/auto.conf, and in a second step, change
Kconfig to generate the auto.conf without "", workaround the issue by
explicitly unquoting CC_IMPLICIT_FALLTHROUGH.
