scsi: scsi_debug: Fix buffer size of REPORT ZONES command

According to ZBC and SPC specifications, the unit of ALLOCATION LENGTH
field of REPORT ZONES command is byte. However, current scsi_debug
implementation handles it as number of zones to calculate buffer size to
report zones. When the ALLOCATION LENGTH has a large number, this results
in too large buffer size and causes memory allocation failure.  Fix the
failure by handling ALLOCATION LENGTH as byte unit.
