ASoC: tegra: Use normal system sleep for ADX

The driver currently subscribes for a late system sleep call.
The initcall_debug log shows that suspend call for ADX device
happens after the parent device (AHUB). This seems to cause
suspend failure on Jetson TX2 platform. Also there is no use
of having late system sleep specifically for ADX device. Fix
the order by using normal system sleep.
