can: m_can: pci: fix iomap_read_fifo() and iomap_write_fifo()

The same fix that was previously done in m_can_platform in commit
99d173fbe894 ("can: m_can: fix iomap_read_fifo() and iomap_write_fifo()")
is required in m_can_pci as well to make iomap_read_fifo() and
iomap_write_fifo() work for val_count > 1.

Fixes: 812270e5445b ("can: m_can: Batch FIFO writes during CAN transmit")
Fixes: 1aa6772f64b4 ("can: m_can: Batch FIFO reads during CAN receive")
