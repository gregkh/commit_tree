perf header: Fix memory leaks when processing feature headers

These leaks were found with leak sanitizer running "perf pipe recording

In pipe mode feat_fd may hold onto an events struct that needs freeing.

When string features are processed they may overwrite an already created
string, so free this before the overwrite.
