qede: validate non LSO skb length

Although it is unlikely that stack could transmit a non LSO
skb with length > MTU, however in some cases or environment such
occurrences actually resulted into firmware asserts due to packet
length being greater than the max supported by the device (~9700B).

This patch adds the safeguard for such odd cases to avoid firmware
asserts.

v2: Added "Fixes" tag with one of the initial driver commit
    which enabled the TX traffic actually (as this was probably
    day1 issue which was discovered recently by some customer
    environment)
