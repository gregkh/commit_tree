iio: adc: stm32: fix a current leak by resetting pcsel before disabling vdda

Some I/Os are connected to ADC input channels, when the corresponding bit
in PCSEL register are set on STM32H7 and STM32MP15. This is done in the
prepare routine of stm32-adc driver.
There are constraints here, as PCSEL shouldn't be set when VDDA supply
is disabled. Enabling/disabling of VDDA supply in done via stm32-adc-core
runtime PM routines (before/after ADC is enabled/disabled).

Currently, PCSEL remains set when disabling ADC. Later on, PM runtime
can disable the VDDA supply. This creates some conditions on I/Os that
can start to leak current.
So PCSEL needs to be cleared when disabling the ADC.
