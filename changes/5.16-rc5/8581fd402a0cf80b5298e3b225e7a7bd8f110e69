treewide: Add missing includes masked by cgroup -> bpf dependency

cgroup.h (therefore swap.h, therefore half of the universe)
includes bpf.h which in turn includes module.h and slab.h.
Since we're about to get rid of that dependency we need
to clean things up.

v2: drop the cpu.h include from cacheinfo.h, it's not necessary
and it makes riscv sensitive to ordering of include files.
