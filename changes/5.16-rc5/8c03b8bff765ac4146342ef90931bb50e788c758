can: m_can: pci: fix incorrect reference clock rate

When testing the CAN controller on our Ekhart Lake hardware, we
determined that all communication was running with twice the configured
bitrate. Changing the reference clock rate from 100MHz to 200MHz fixed
this. Intel's support has confirmed to us that 200MHz is indeed the
correct clock rate.
