ASoC: qdsp6: q6routing: Fix return value from msm_routing_put_audio_mixer

msm_routing_put_audio_mixer() can return incorrect value in various scenarios.

scenario 1:
amixer cset iface=MIXER,name='SLIMBUS_0_RX Audio Mixer MultiMedia1' 1
amixer cset iface=MIXER,name='SLIMBUS_0_RX Audio Mixer MultiMedia1' 0

return value is 0 instead of 1 eventhough value was changed

scenario 2:
amixer cset iface=MIXER,name='SLIMBUS_0_RX Audio Mixer MultiMedia1' 1
amixer cset iface=MIXER,name='SLIMBUS_0_RX Audio Mixer MultiMedia1' 1

return value is 1 instead of 0 eventhough the value was not changed

scenario 3:
amixer cset iface=MIXER,name='SLIMBUS_0_RX Audio Mixer MultiMedia1' 0
return value is 1 instead of 0 eventhough the value was not changed

Fix this by adding checks, so that change notifications are sent correctly.
