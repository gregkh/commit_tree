xhci: Remove CONFIG_USB_DEFAULT_PERSIST to prevent xHCI from runtime suspending

When the xHCI is quirked with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME, runtime resume
routine also resets the controller.

This is bad for USB drivers without reset_resume callback, because
there's no subsequent call of usb_dev_complete() ->
usb_resume_complete() to force rebinding the driver to the device. For
instance, btusb device stops working after xHCI controller is runtime
resumed, if the controlled is quirked with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME.

So always take XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME into account to solve the issue.
