selftests: netfilter: Add correctness test for mac,net set type

The existing net,mac test didn't cover the issue recently reported
by Nikita Yushchenko, where MAC addresses wouldn't match if given
as first field of a concatenated set with AVX2 and 8-bit groups,
because there's a different code path covering the lookup of six
8-bit groups (MAC addresses) if that's the first field.

Add a similar mac,net test, with MAC address and IPv4 address
swapped in the set specification.
