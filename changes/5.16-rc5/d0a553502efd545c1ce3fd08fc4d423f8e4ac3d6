irqchip/armada-370-xp: Fix support for Multi-MSI interrupts

irq-armada-370-xp driver already sets MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI flag into
msi_domain_info structure. But allocated interrupt numbers for Multi-MSI
needs to be properly aligned otherwise devices send MSI interrupt with
wrong number.

Fix this issue by using function bitmap_find_free_region() instead of
bitmap_find_next_zero_area() to allocate aligned interrupt numbers.
