Revert "kbuild: Enable DT schema checks for %.dtb targets"

This reverts commit 53182e81f47d4ea0c727c49ad23cb782173ab849.

This added tool dependencies on various build systems using %.dtb
targets. Validation will need to be controlled by a kconfig or make
variable instead, but for now let's just revert it.
