tools/resolve_btfids: Skip unresolved symbol warning for empty BTF sets

resolve_btfids prints a warning when it finds an unresolved symbol,
(id == 0) in id_patch. This can be the case for BTF sets that are empty
(due to disabled config options), hence printing warnings for certain
builds, most recently seen in [0].

The reason behind this is because id->cnt aliases id->id in btf_id
struct, leading to empty set showing up as ID 0 when we get to id_patch,
which triggers the warning. Since sets are an exception here, accomodate
by reusing hole in btf_id for bool is_set member, setting it to true for
BTF set when setting id->cnt, and use that to skip extraneous warning.

Before:

; ./tools/bpf/resolve_btfids/resolve_btfids -v -b vmlinux net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.ko
adding symbol tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids
WARN: resolve_btfids: unresolved symbol tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids
patching addr     0: ID       0 [tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids]
sorting  addr     4: cnt      0 [tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids]
update ok for net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.ko

After:

; ./tools/bpf/resolve_btfids/resolve_btfids -v -b vmlinux net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.ko
adding symbol tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids
patching addr     0: ID       0 [tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids]
sorting  addr     4: cnt      0 [tcp_cubic_kfunc_ids]
update ok for net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.ko
