iio: adc: axp20x_adc: fix charging current reporting on AXP22x

Both the charging and discharging currents on AXP22x are stored as
12-bit integers, in accordance with the datasheet.
It's also confirmed by vendor BSP (axp20x_adc.c:axp22_icharge_to_mA).

The scale factor of 0.5 is never mentioned in datasheet, nor in the
vendor source code. I think it was here to compensate for
erroneous addition bit in register width.

Tested on custom A40i+AXP221s board with external ammeter as
a reference.
