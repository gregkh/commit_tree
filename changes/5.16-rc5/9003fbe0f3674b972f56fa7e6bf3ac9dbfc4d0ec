HID: quirks: Add quirk for the Microsoft Surface 3 type-cover

Add a HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk for the
Microsoft Surface 3 (non pro) type-cover.

Trying to init the reports seems to confuse the type-cover and
causes 2 issues:

1. Despite hid-multitouch sending the command to switch the
touchpad to multitouch mode, it keeps sending events on the
mouse emulation interface.

2. The touchpad completely stops sending events after a reboot.

Adding the HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk fixes both issues.
