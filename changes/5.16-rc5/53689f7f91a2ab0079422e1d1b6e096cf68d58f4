ASoC: rockchip: i2s_tdm: Dup static DAI template

Previously, the DAI template was used directly, which lead to
fun bugs such as "why is my channels_max changing?" when one
instantiated more than one i2s_tdm IP block in a device tree.

This change makes it so that we instead duplicate the template
struct, and then use that.
