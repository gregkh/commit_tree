perf intel-pt: Fix some PGE (packet generation enable/control flow packets) usage

Packet generation enable (PGE) refers to whether control flow (COFI)
packets are being produced.

PGE may be false even when branch-tracing is enabled, due to being
out-of-context, or outside a filter address range.  Fix some missing PGE
usage.

Fixes: 7c1b16ba0e26e6 ("perf intel-pt: Add support for decoding FUP/TIP only")
Fixes: 839598176b0554 ("perf intel-pt: Allow decoding with branch tracing disabled")
