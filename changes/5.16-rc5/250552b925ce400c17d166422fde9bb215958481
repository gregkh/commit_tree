KVM: nVMX: Don't use Enlightened MSR Bitmap for L3

When KVM runs as a nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V it uses Enlightened
VMCS and enables Enlightened MSR Bitmap feature for its L1s and L2s (which
are actually L2s and L3s from Hyper-V's perspective). When MSR bitmap is
updated, KVM has to reset HV_VMX_ENLIGHTENED_CLEAN_FIELD_MSR_BITMAP from
clean fields to make Hyper-V aware of the change. For KVM's L1s, this is
done in vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr()/vmx_enable_intercept_for_msr().
MSR bitmap for L2 is build in nested_vmx_prepare_msr_bitmap() by blending
MSR bitmap for L1 and L1's idea of MSR bitmap for L2. KVM, however, doesn't
check if the resulting bitmap is different and never cleans
HV_VMX_ENLIGHTENED_CLEAN_FIELD_MSR_BITMAP in eVMCS02. This is incorrect and
may result in Hyper-V missing the update.

The issue could've been solved by calling evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() for
eVMCS02 from nested_vmx_prepare_msr_bitmap() unconditionally but doing so
would not give any performance benefits (compared to not using Enlightened
MSR Bitmap at all). 3-level nesting is also not a very common setup
nowadays.

Don't enable 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' feature for KVM's L2s (real L3s) for
now.
