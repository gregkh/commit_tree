perf intel-pt: Fix sync state when a PSB (synchronization) packet is found

When syncing, it may be that branch packet generation is not enabled at
that point, in which case there will not immediately be a control-flow
packet, so some packets before a control flow packet turns up, get
ignored.  However, the decoder is in sync as soon as a PSB is found, so
the state should be set accordingly.
