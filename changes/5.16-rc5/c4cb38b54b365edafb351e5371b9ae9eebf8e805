dt-bindings: input: gpio-keys: Fix interrupts in example

The "interrupts" property in the example looks weird:
  - The type is not in the last cell,
  - Level interrupts don't work well with gpio-keys, as they keep the
    interrupt asserted as long as the key is pressed, causing an
    interrupt storm.

Use a more realistic falling-edge interrupt instead.
