KVM: x86: Ignore sparse banks size for an "all CPUs", non-sparse IPI req

Do not bail early if there are no bits set in the sparse banks for a
non-sparse, a.k.a. "all CPUs", IPI request.  Per the Hyper-V spec, it is
legal to have a variable length of '0', e.g. VP_SET's BankContents in
this case, if the request can be serviced without the extra info.

  It is possible that for a given invocation of a hypercall that does
  accept variable sized input headers that all the header input fits
  entirely within the fixed size header. In such cases the variable sized
  input header is zero-sized and the corresponding bits in the hypercall
  input should be set to zero.

Bailing early results in KVM failing to send IPIs to all CPUs as expected
by the guest.
