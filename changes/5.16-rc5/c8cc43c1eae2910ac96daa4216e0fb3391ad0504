selftests: KVM: avoid failures due to reserved HyperTransport region

AMD proceessors define an address range that is reserved by HyperTransport
and causes a failure if used for guest physical addresses.  Avoid
selftests failures by reserving those guest physical addresses; the
rules are:

- On parts with <40 bits, its fully hidden from software.

- Before Fam17h, it was always 12G just below 1T, even if there was more
RAM above this location.  In this case we just not use any RAM above 1T.

- On Fam17h and later, it is variable based on SME, and is either just
below 2^48 (no encryption) or 2^43 (encryption).
