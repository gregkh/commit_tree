ath11k: Fix the hal descriptor mask

Below listed hal descriptor mask are incorrect, so modify it to correct one
 - CE destination status description meta info mask is increased from
   8 bits to 16 bits from the 0th bit position
 - Rx Reo queue duplicate count mask is decreased from 22 bits to 16 bits
 - Reo threshold status counter sum mask is increased from 24 bits to 26 bits

No functionality impact, these descriptors are currently not used in any
supported platform. But in future if someone referred these descriptor then
ended with wrong values.

Found this during code review.
