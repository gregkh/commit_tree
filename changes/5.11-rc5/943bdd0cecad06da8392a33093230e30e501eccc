cpufreq: powernow-k8: pass policy rather than use cpufreq_cpu_get()

Currently there is an unlikely case where cpufreq_cpu_get() returns a
NULL policy and this will cause a NULL pointer dereference later on.

Fix this by passing the policy to transition_frequency_fidvid() from
the caller and hence eliminating the need for the cpufreq_cpu_get()
and cpufreq_cpu_put().

Thanks to Viresh Kumar for suggesting the fix.
