net: ena: add device distinct log prefix to files

ENA logs are adjusted to display the full ENA representation to
distinct each ENA device in case of multiple interfaces.
Using netdev_err/warn and dev_info functions for logging provides
uniform printing with clear distinction of the device and interface.

This patch changes all printing in ena_com files to use netev_* logging
functions except for messages of info level. Log functions of that level
would be printed with dev_info because of the early stage they are
called in when net_device struct isn't yet registered.

To allow using netdev_* functions in all ena_com functions, a pointer to
the net_device was added to ena_com_dev struct.

The patch also adds some log messages to make driver debugging easier.
