MIPS: Don't round up kernel sections size for memblock_add()

Linux doesn't own the memory immediately after the kernel image. On Octeon
bootloader places a shared structure right close after the kernel _end,
refer to "struct cvmx_bootinfo *octeon_bootinfo" in cavium-octeon/setup.c.

If check_kernel_sections_mem() rounds the PFNs up, first memblock_alloc()
inside early_init_dt_alloc_memory_arch() <= device_tree_init() returns
memory block overlapping with the above octeon_bootinfo structure, which
is being overwritten afterwards.
