kcov, usb: only collect coverage from __usb_hcd_giveback_urb in softirq

Currently there's a KCOV remote coverage collection section in
__usb_hcd_giveback_urb(). Initially that section was added based on the
assumption that usb_hcd_giveback_urb() can only be called in interrupt
context as indicated by a comment before it. This is what happens when
syzkaller is fuzzing the USB stack via the dummy_hcd driver.

As it turns out, it's actually valid to call usb_hcd_giveback_urb() in task
context, provided that the caller turned off the interrupts; USB/IP does
exactly that. This can lead to a nested KCOV remote coverage collection
sections both trying to collect coverage in task context. This isn't
supported by KCOV, and leads to a WARNING.

Change __usb_hcd_giveback_urb() to only call kcov_remote_*() callbacks
when it's being executed in a softirq. As the result, the coverage from
USB/IP related usb_hcd_giveback_urb() calls won't be collected, but the
WARNING is fixed.

A potential future improvement would be to support nested remote coverage
collection sections, but this patch doesn't address that.
