powerpc/smp: Rename cpu_l1_cache_map as thread_group_l1_cache_map

On platforms which have the "ibm,thread-groups" property, the per-cpu
variable cpu_l1_cache_map keeps a track of which group of threads
within the same core share the L1 cache, Instruction and Data flow.

This patch renames the variable to "thread_group_l1_cache_map" to make
it consistent with a subsequent patch which will introduce
thread_group_l2_cache_map.

This patch introduces no functional change.
