media: v4l2-fwnode: v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse caller must init vep argument

Document that the caller of v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse() must init the
fields of struct v4l2_fwnode_endpoint (vep argument) fields.

It used to be that the fields were zeroed by v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse
when bus type was set to V4L2_MBUS_UNKNOWN but with recent changes (Fixes:
line below) that no longer makes sense.

Fixes: bb4bba9232fc ("media: v4l2-fwnode: Make bus configuration a struct")
