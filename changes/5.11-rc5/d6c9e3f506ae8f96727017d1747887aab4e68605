net: ipa: only enable generic command completion IRQ when needed

The completion of a generic EE GSI command is signaled by a global
interrupt of type GP_INT1.  The only other used type for a global
interrupt is a hardware error report.

First, disallow all global interrupt types in gsi_irq_setup().  We
want to know about hardware errors, so re-enable the interrupt type
in gsi_irq_enable(), to allow hardware errors to be reported.
Disable that interrupt type again in gsi_irq_disable().

We only issue generic EE commands one at a time, and there's no
reason to keep the completion interrupt enabled when no generic
EE command is pending.  We furthermore have no need to enable the
GP_INT2 or GP_INT3 interrupt types (which aren't used).

The change in gsi_irq_enable() makes GSI_CNTXT_GLOB_IRQ_ALL unused,
so get rid of it.  Have gsi_generic_command() enable the GP_INT1
interrupt type (in addition to the ERROR_INT type) only while a
generic command is pending.
