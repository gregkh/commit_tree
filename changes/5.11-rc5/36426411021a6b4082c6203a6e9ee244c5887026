net: ipa: set up IPA v4.5 Qtime configuration

IPA v4.5 introduces a new unified timer architecture driven on the
19.2 MHz SoC crystal oscillator (XO).  It is independent of the IPA
core clock and avoids some duplication.

Lower-resolution time stamps are derived from this by using only the
high-order bits of the 19.2 MHz Qtime clock.  And timers are derived
from this based on "pulse generators" configured to fire at a fixed
rate based on the Qtime clock.

This patch introduces ipa_qtime_config(), which configures the Qtime
mechanism for use.  It also adds to the IPA register definitions
related to timers and time stamping.
