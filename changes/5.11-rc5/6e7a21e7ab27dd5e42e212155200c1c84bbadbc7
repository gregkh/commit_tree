drm/i915/selftests: Exercise intel_timeline_read_hwsp()

intel_timeline_read_hwsp() is used to support semaphore waits between
engines, that may themselves be deferred for arbitrary periods -- that
is the read of the target request's HWSP is at an indeterminant point in
the future. To support this, we need to prevent overwriting a HWSP that
is being watched across a seqno wrap (otherwise the next request will
write its value into the old HWSP preventing the watcher from making
progress, ad infinitum.) To simulate the observer across a wrap, let's
create a request that reads from the HWSP and dispatch it at different
points around a wrap to see if the value is lost.
