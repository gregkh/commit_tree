fuse: add a flag FUSE_OPEN_KILL_SUIDGID for open() request

With FUSE_HANDLE_KILLPRIV_V2 support, server will need to kill suid/sgid/
security.capability on open(O_TRUNC), if server supports
FUSE_ATOMIC_O_TRUNC.

But server needs to kill suid/sgid only if caller does not have CAP_FSETID.
Given server does not have this information, client needs to send this info
to server.

So add a flag FUSE_OPEN_KILL_SUIDGID to fuse_open_in request which tells
server to kill suid/sgid (only if group execute is set).

This flag is added to the FUSE_OPEN request, as well as the FUSE_CREATE
request if the create was non-exclusive, since that might result in an
existing file being opened/truncated.
