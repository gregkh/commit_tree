mac80211: fix incorrect strlen of .write in debugfs

This fixes strlen mismatch problems happening in some .write callbacks
of debugfs.

When trying to configure airtime_flags in debugfs, an error appeared:
ash: write error: Invalid argument

The error is returned from kstrtou16() since a wrong length makes it
miss the real end of input string.  To fix this, use count as the string
length, and set proper end of string for a char buffer.

The debug print is shown - airtime_flags_write: count = 2, len = 8,
where the actual length is 2, but "len = strlen(buf)" gets 8.

Also cleanup the other similar cases for the sake of consistency.
