perf mem: Introduce weak function perf_mem_events__ptr()

Different architectures might use different event or different event
parameters for memory profiling, this patch introduces a weak
perf_mem_events__ptr() function which allows to return back a
architecture specific memory event.

Since the variable 'perf_mem_events' can be only accessed by the
perf_mem_events__ptr() function, mark the variable as 'static', this
allows the architectures to define its own memory event array.
