rtc: hym8563: enable wakeup when applicable

Enable wakeup in the hym8563 driver if the IRQ was successfully
requested or if wakeup-source is set in the devicetree.

As per the description of device_init_wakeup(), it should be enabled
for "devices that everyone expects to be wakeup sources".  One would
expect this to be the case with a real-time clock.

Tested on rk3288-rock2-square, which has an IRQ configured for the
RTC.  As a result, wakeup was enabled during driver initialisation.
