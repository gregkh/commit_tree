sctp: call sk_setup_caps in sctp_packet_transmit instead

sk_setup_caps() was originally called in Commit 90017accff61 ("sctp:
Add GSO support"), as:

  "We have to refresh this in case we are xmiting to more than one
   transport at a time"

This actually happens in the loop of sctp_outq_flush_transports(),
and it shouldn't be tied to gso, so move it out of gso part and
before sctp_packet_pack().
