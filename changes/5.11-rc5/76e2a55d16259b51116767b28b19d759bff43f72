mptcp: better msk-level shutdown.

Instead of re-implementing most of inet_shutdown, re-use
such helper, and implement the MPTCP-specific bits at the
'proto' level.

The msk-level disconnect() can now be invoked, lets provide a
suitable implementation.

As a side effect, this fixes bad state management for listener
sockets. The latter could lead to division by 0 oops since
commit ea4ca586b16f ("mptcp: refine MPTCP-level ack scheduling").
