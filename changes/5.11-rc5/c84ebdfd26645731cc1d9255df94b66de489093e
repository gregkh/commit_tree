arm64: tegra: Change order of SATA resets for Tegra132 and Tegra210

Tegra AHCI dt-binding doc is converted from text based to yaml based.

dtbs_check valdiation strictly follows reset-names order specified
in yaml dt-binding.

Tegra124 thru Tegra210 has 3 resets sata, sata-oob and sata-cold.
Tegra186 has 2 resets sata and sata-cold.

This patch changes order of SATA resets to maintain proper resets
order for commonly available resets across Tegra124 thru Tegra186
for dtbs_check to pass.
