Input: libps2 - fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix a
warning by replacing a /* Fall through */ comment with the new
pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* Fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
