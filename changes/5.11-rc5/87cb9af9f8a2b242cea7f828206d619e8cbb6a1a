ALSA: usb-audio: Fix UAC1 rate setup for secondary endpoints

The current sample rate setup function for UAC1 assumes only the first
endpoint retrieved from the interface:altset pair, but the rate set up
may be needed also for the secondary endpoint.  Also, retrieving the
endpoint number from the interface descriptor is redundant; we have
already the target endpoint in the given audioformat object.

This patch simplifies the code and corrects the target endpoint as
described in the above.  It simply refers to fmt->endpoint directly.

Also, this patch drops the pioneer_djm_set_format_quirk() that is
caleld from snd_usb_set_format_quirk(); this function does the sample
rate setup but for the capture endpoint (0x82), and that's exactly
what the change above fixes.
