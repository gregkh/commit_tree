module: drop version-attribute alignment

Commit 98562ad8cb03 ("module: explicitly align module_version_attribute
structure") added an alignment attribute to the struct
module_version_attribute type in order to fix an alignment issue on m68k
where the structure is 2-byte aligned while MODULE_VERSION() forced the
__modver section entries to be 4-byte aligned (sizeof(void *)).

This was essentially an alternative fix to the problem addressed by
b4bc842802db ("module: deal with alignment issues in built-in module
versions") which used the array-of-pointer trick to prevent gcc from
increasing alignment of the version attribute entries. And with the
pointer indirection in place there's no need to increase the alignment
of the type.
