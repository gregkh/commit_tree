cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix fast-switch fallback path

When sugov_update_single_perf() falls back to the "frequency"
path due to the missing scale-invariance, it will call
cpufreq_driver_fast_switch() via sugov_fast_switch()
and the driver's ->fast_switch() callback will be invoked,
so it must not be NULL.

However, after commit a365ab6b9dfb ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Implement
the ->adjust_perf() callback") intel_pstate sets ->fast_switch() to
NULL when it is going to use intel_cpufreq_adjust_perf(), which is a
mistake, because on x86 the scale-invariance may be turned off
dynamically, so modify it to retain the original ->adjust_perf()
callback pointer.

Fixes: a365ab6b9dfb ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Implement the ->adjust_perf() callback")
