tty: Remove dead termiox code

set_termiox() and the TCGETX handler bail out with -EINVAL immediately
if ->termiox is NULL, but there are no code paths that can set
->termiox to a non-NULL pointer; and no such code paths seem to have
existed since the termiox mechanism was introduced back in
commit 1d65b4a088de ("tty: Add termiox") in v2.6.28.
Similarly, no driver actually implements .set_termiox; and it looks like
no driver ever has.

Delete this dead code; but leave the definition of struct termiox in the
UAPI headers intact.
