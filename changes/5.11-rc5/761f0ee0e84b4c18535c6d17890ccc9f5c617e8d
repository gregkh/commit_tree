platform/x86: ISST: Allow configurable offset range

The mmio offset range can be different based on the PCI device id. Here
for INTEL_RAPL_PRIO_DEVID_1, the range is increased from 45 to 64. Pass
the range as the driver_data. Also account for different ranges during
save/restore via suspend/resume callbacks.
