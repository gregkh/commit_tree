ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Resume codec to do jack detection

Instead of queueing jackpoll_work, runtime resume the codec to let it
use different jack detection methods based on jackpoll_interval.

This partially matches SOF driver's behavior with commit a6e7d0a4bdb0
("ALSA: hda: fix jack detection with Realtek codecs when in D3"), the
difference is SOF unconditionally resumes the codec.
