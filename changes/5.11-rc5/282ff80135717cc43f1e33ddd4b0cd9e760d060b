KVM: arm64: Remove redundant call to kvm_pmu_vcpu_reset()

KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT ioctl calls kvm_reset_vcpu(), which in turn resets the
PMU with a call to kvm_pmu_vcpu_reset(). The function zeroes the PMU
chained counters bitmap and stops all the counters with a perf event
attached. Because it is called before the VCPU has had the chance to run,
no perf events are in use and none are released.

kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable(), called by kvm_vcpu_first_run_init() only if the
VCPU has been initialized, also resets the PMU. kvm_pmu_vcpu_reset() in
this case does the exact same thing as the previous call, so remove it.
