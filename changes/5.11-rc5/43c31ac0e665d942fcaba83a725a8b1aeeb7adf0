sched: Remove relyance on STRUCT_ALIGNMENT

Florian reported that all of kernel/sched/ is rebuild when
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is changed, which, while not a bug is
unexpected. This is due to us including vmlinux.lds.h.

Jakub explained that the problem is that we put the alignment
requirement on the type instead of on a variable. Type alignment is a
minimum, the compiler is free to pick any larger alignment for a
specific instance of the type (eg. the variable).

So force the type alignment on all individual variable definitions and
remove the undesired dependency on vmlinux.lds.h.

Fixes: 85c2ce9104eb ("sched, vmlinux.lds: Increase STRUCT_ALIGNMENT to 64 bytes for GCC-4.9")
