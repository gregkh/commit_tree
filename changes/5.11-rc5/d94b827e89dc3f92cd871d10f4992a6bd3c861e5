powerpc/book3s64/kuap: Use Key 3 for kernel mapping with hash translation

This patch updates kernel hash page table entries to use storage key 3
for its mapping. This implies all kernel access will now use key 3 to
control READ/WRITE. The patch also prevents the allocation of key 3 from
userspace and UAMOR value is updated such that userspace cannot modify key 3.
