ibmvnic: Correctly re-enable interrupts in NAPI polling routine

If the current NAPI polling loop exits without completing it's
budget, only re-enable interrupts if there are no entries remaining
in the queue and napi_complete_done is successful. If there are entries
remaining on the queue that were missed, restart the polling loop.
