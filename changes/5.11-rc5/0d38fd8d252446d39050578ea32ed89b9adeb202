MAINTAINERS: update references to stm32 audio bindings

Changeset 81437cc3b0d9 ("Merge series "dt-bindings: stm32: convert audio dfsdm to json-schema" from Olivier Moysan <olivier.moysan@st.com>:")
removed bindings/sound/st,stm32-adfsdm.txt, as stm32-* audio
bindings are now under: bindings/iio/adc/st,stm32-*.yaml.

Update cross-references to them accordingly.
