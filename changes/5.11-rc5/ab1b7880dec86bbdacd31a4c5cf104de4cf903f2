rcutorture:  Make stutter_wait() caller restore priority

Currently, stutter_wait() will happily spin waiting for the stutter
interval to end even if the caller is running at a real-time priority
level.  This could starve normal-priority tasks for no good reason.  This
commit therefore drops the calling task's priority to SCHED_OTHER MAX_NICE
if stutter_wait() needs to wait.  But when it waits, stutter_wait()
returns true, which allows the caller to restore the priority if needed.
Callers that were already running at SCHED_OTHER MAX_NICE obviously
do not need any changes, but this commit also restores priority for
higher-priority callers.
