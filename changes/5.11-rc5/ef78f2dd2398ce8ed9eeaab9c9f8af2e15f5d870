powerpc/85xx: Fix declaration made after definition

Currently the clang build of corenet64_smp_defconfig fails with:

  arch/powerpc/platforms/85xx/corenet_generic.c:210:1: error:
  attribute declaration must precede definition
  machine_arch_initcall(corenet_generic, corenet_gen_publish_devices);

Fix it by moving the initcall definition prior to the machine
definition, and directly below the function it calls, which is the
usual style anyway.
