selftests: Add benchmark for syscall user dispatch

This is the patch I'm using to evaluate the impact syscall user dispatch
has on native syscall (syscalls not redirected to userspace) when
enabled for the process and submiting syscalls though the unblocked
dispatch selector. It works by running a step to define a baseline of
the cost of executing sysinfo, then enabling SUD, and rerunning that
step.

On my test machine, an AMD Ryzen 5 1500X, I have the following results
with the latest version of syscall user dispatch patches.

root@olga:~# syscall_user_dispatch/sud_benchmark
  Calibrating test set to last ~5 seconds...
  test iterations = 37500000
  Avg syscall time 134ns.
  Caught sys_ff00
  trapped_call_count 1, native_call_count 0.
  Avg syscall time 147ns.
  Interception overhead: 9.7% (+13ns).
