arm64: dts: qcom: qrb5165-rb5: Add USB support

RB5 makes use of the two USB controllers onboard. USB0 is connected
to the Type C port and USB1 is connected to USB3.1 HUB which exposes
following downstream ports:

* 2 Type A ports
* 2 HS/SS ports on the expansion connector
* USB to LAN device

Hence, enable these two controllers with the required PHYs.
