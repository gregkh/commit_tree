ntp: Fix RTC synchronization on 32-bit platforms

Due to an integer overflow, RTC synchronization now happens every 2s
instead of the intended 11 minutes.  Fix this by forcing 64-bit
arithmetic for the sync period calculation.

Annotate the other place which multiplies seconds for consistency as well.
