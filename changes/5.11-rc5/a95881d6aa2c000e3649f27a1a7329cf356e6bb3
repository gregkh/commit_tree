pinctrl: qcom: Properly clear "intr_ack_high" interrupts when unmasking

In commit 4b7618fdc7e6 ("pinctrl: qcom: Add irq_enable callback for
msm gpio") we tried to Ack interrupts during unmask.  However, that
patch forgot to check "intr_ack_high" so, presumably, it only worked
for a certain subset of SoCs.

Let's add a small accessor so we don't need to open-code the logic in
both places.

This was found by code inspection.  I don't have any access to the
hardware in question nor software that needs the Ack during unmask.
