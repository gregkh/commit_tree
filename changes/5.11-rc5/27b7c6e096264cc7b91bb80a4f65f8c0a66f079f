i2c: tegra: Wait for config load atomically while in ISR

Upon a communication error, the interrupt handler can call
tegra_i2c_disable_packet_mode. This causes a sleeping poll to happen
unless the current transaction was marked atomic. Fix this by
making the poll happen atomically if we are in an IRQ.

This matches the behavior prior to the patch mentioned
in the Fixes tag.
