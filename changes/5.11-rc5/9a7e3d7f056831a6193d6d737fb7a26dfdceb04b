ACPI: NFIT: Fix input validation of bus-family

Dan reports that smatch thinks userspace can craft an out-of-bound bus
family number. However, nd_cmd_clear_to_send() blocks all non-zero
values of bus-family since only the kernel can initiate these commands.
However, in the speculation path, family is a user controlled array
index value so mask it for speculation safety. Also, since the
nd_cmd_clear_to_send() safety is non-obvious and possibly may change in
the future include input validation as if userspace could get past the
nd_cmd_clear_to_send() gatekeeper.
