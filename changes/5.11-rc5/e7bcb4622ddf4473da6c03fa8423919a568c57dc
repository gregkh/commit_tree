powerpc: Enable seccomp architecture tracking

To enable seccomp constant action bitmaps, we need to have a static
mapping to the audit architecture and system call table size. Add these
for powerpc.

__LITTLE_ENDIAN__ is used here instead of CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
to keep it consistent with asm/syscall.h.
