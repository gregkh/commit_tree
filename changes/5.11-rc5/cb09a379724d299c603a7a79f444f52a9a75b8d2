x86/topology: Set cpu_die_id only if DIE_TYPE found

CPUID Leaf 0x1F defines a DIE_TYPE level (nb: ECX[8:15] level type == 0x5),
but CPUID Leaf 0xB does not. However, detect_extended_topology() will
set struct cpuinfo_x86.cpu_die_id regardless of whether a valid Die ID
was found.

Only set cpu_die_id if a DIE_TYPE level is found. CPU topology code may
use another value for cpu_die_id, e.g. the AMD NodeId on AMD-based
systems. Code ordering should be maintained so that the CPUID Leaf 0x1F
Die ID value will take precedence on systems that may use another value.
