arm64: Enable perf events based hard lockup detector

With the recent feature added to enable perf events to use pseudo NMIs
as interrupts on platforms which support GICv3 or later, its now been
possible to enable hard lockup detector (or NMI watchdog) on arm64
platforms. So enable corresponding support.

One thing to note here is that normally lockup detector is initialized
just after the early initcalls but PMU on arm64 comes up much later as
device_initcall(). So we need to re-initialize lockup detection once
PMU has been initialized.
