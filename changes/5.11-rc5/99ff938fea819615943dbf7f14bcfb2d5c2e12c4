dt-bindings:iio:temperature: Drop generic binding file.

So far, the thermocouple-type property described in here is only
used in a single driver.  Whilst I would like it to be more generally
used that hasn't happened yet and I don't see a reason to maintain
this small file in the hope that it happens.

I pushed for this generic binding in the first place.  Hopefully
we can bring it back at somepoint.
