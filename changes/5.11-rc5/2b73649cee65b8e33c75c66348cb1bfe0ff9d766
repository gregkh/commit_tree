ALSA: hda: Balance runtime/system PM if direct-complete is disabled

After hibernation, HDA controller can't be runtime-suspended after
commit 215a22ed31a1 ("ALSA: hda: Refactor codjc PM to use
direct-complete optimization"), which enables direct-complete for HDA
codec.

The HDA codec driver didn't expect direct-complete will be disabled
after it returns a positive value from prepare() callback. However,
there are some places that PM core can disable direct-complete. For
instance, system hibernation or when codec has subordinates like LEDs.

So if the codec is prepared for direct-complete but PM core still calls
codec's suspend or freeze callback, partially revert the commit and take
the original approach, which uses pm_runtime_force_*() helpers to
ensure PM refcount are balanced. Meanwhile, still keep prepare() and
complete() callbacks to enable direct-complete and request a resume for
jack detection, respectively.
