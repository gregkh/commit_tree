selftests/bpf: Fix broken riscv build

The selftests/bpf Makefile includes system include directories from
the host, when building BPF programs. On RISC-V glibc requires that
__riscv_xlen is defined. This is not the case for "clang -target bpf",
which messes up __WORDSIZE (errno.h -> ... -> wordsize.h) and breaks
the build.

By explicitly defining __risc_xlen correctly for riscv, we can
workaround this.
