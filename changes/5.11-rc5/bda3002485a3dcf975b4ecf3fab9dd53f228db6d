drm/i915: Improve record of hung engines in error state

Between events which trigger engine and GPU resets and capturing the error
state we lose information on which engine triggered the reset. Improve
this by passing in the hung engine mask down to error capture.

Result is that the list of engines in user visible "GPU HANG: ecode
<gen>:<engines>:<ecode>, <process>" is now a list of hanging and not just
active engines. Most importantly the displayed process is now the one
which was actually hung.

v2:
 * Stub prototype. (Chris)
