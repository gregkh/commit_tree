net/smc: Introduce SMCR get link command

Introduce get link command which loops through
all available links of all available link groups. It
uses the SMC-R linkgroup list as entry point, not
the socket list, which makes linkgroup diagnosis
possible, in case linkgroup does not contain active
connections anymore.
