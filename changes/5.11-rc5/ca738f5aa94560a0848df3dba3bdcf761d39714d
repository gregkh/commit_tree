s390/ctcm: Avoid temporary allocation of struct pdu.

The size of struct pdu is 8 byte. The memory is allocated, initialized,
used and deallocated a few lines later.

It is more efficient to avoid the allocation/free dance and assign the
values directly to skb's data part instead of using memcpy() for it.

Avoid an allocation of struct pdu and use the resulting skb pointer
instead.
