xen/privcmd: allow fetching resource sizes

Allow issuing an IOCTL_PRIVCMD_MMAP_RESOURCE ioctl with num = 0 and
addr = 0 in order to fetch the size of a specific resource.

Add a shortcut to the default map resource path, since fetching the
size requires no address to be passed in, and thus no VMA to setup.

This is missing from the initial implementation, and causes issues
when mapping resources that don't have fixed or known sizes.
