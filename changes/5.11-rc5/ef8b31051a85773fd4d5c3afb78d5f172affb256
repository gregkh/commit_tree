ARM: dts: imx6sl-warp: correct vendor in compatible to Revotics

The WaRP board (Wearable Development Platform) was apparently made by
Revolution Robotics, Inc (brand: Revotics), not by "Warp".  Correct the
vendor in compatible to reflect this.  The compatibles were not
documented in the bindings before.
