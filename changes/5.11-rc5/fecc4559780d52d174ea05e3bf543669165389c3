fsnotify: fix events reported to watching parent and child

fsnotify_parent() used to send two separate events to backends when a
parent inode is watching children and the child inode is also watching.
In an attempt to avoid duplicate events in fanotify, we unified the two
backend callbacks to a single callback and handled the reporting of the
two separate events for the relevant backends (inotify and dnotify).
However the handling is buggy and can result in inotify and dnotify
listeners receiving events of the type they never asked for or spurious
events.

The problem is the unified event callback with two inode marks (parent and
child) is called when any of the parent and child inodes are watched and
interested in the event, but the parent inode's mark that is interested
in the event on the child is not necessarily the one we are currently
reporting to (it could belong to a different group).

So before reporting the parent or child event flavor to backend we need
to check that the mark is really interested in that event flavor.

The semantics of INODE and CHILD marks were hard to follow and made the
logic more complicated than it should have been.  Replace it with INODE
and PARENT marks semantics to hopefully make the logic more clear.

Thanks to Hugh Dickins for spotting a bug in the earlier version of this
patch.
