crypto: keembay - Add support for Keem Bay OCS AES/SM4

Add support for the AES/SM4 crypto engine included in the Offload and
Crypto Subsystem (OCS) of the Intel Keem Bay SoC, thus enabling
hardware-acceleration for the following transformations:

- ecb(aes), cbc(aes), ctr(aes), cts(cbc(aes)), gcm(aes) and cbc(aes);
  supported for 128-bit and 256-bit keys.

- ecb(sm4), cbc(sm4), ctr(sm4), cts(cbc(sm4)), gcm(sm4) and cbc(sm4);
  supported for 128-bit keys.

The driver passes crypto manager self-tests, including the extra tests
(CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS=y).
