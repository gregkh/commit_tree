io_uring: fix short read retries for non-reg files

Sockets and other non-regular files may actually expect short reads to
happen, don't retry reads for them. Because non-reg files don't set
FMODE_BUF_RASYNC and so it won't do second/retry do_read, we can filter
out those cases after first do_read() attempt with ret>0.
