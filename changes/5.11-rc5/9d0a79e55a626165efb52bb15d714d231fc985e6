media: Documentation: v4l: Document required controls on camera sensors

Raw camera sensors connected to parallel or CSI-2 busses need to implement
V4L2_CID_LINK_FREQ control so receiver drivers can configure the hardware
accordingly.

Document this. Also say V4L2_CID_PIXEL_RATE is recommended for such
hardware.
