dmaengine: Add support for per channel coherency handling

If the DMA device supports per channel coherency configuration (a channel
can be configured to have coherent or not coherent view) then a single
device (the DMA controller's device) can not be used for dma_api for all
channels as channels can have different coherency.

Introduce custom_dma_mapping flag for the dma_chan and a new helper to get
the device pointer to be used for dma_api for the given channel.

Client drivers should be updated to be able to support per channel
coherency by:

- dma_map_single(chan->device->dev, ptr, size, DMA_TO_DEVICE);
+ struct device *dma_dev = dmaengine_get_dma_device(chan);
+
+ dma_map_single(dma_dev, ptr, size, DMA_TO_DEVICE);
