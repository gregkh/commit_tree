KVM: arm64: Move hyp-init params to a per-CPU struct

Once we start initializing KVM on newly booted cores before the rest of
the kernel, parameters to __do_hyp_init will need to be provided by EL2
rather than EL1. At that point it will not be possible to pass its three
arguments directly because PSCI_CPU_ON only supports one context
argument.

Refactor __do_hyp_init to accept its parameters in a struct. This
prepares the code for KVM booting cores as well as removes any limits on
the number of __do_hyp_init arguments.
