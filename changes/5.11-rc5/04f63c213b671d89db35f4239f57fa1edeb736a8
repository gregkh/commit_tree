driver core: Redefine the meaning of fwnode_operations.add_links()

Change the meaning of fwnode_operations.add_links() to just create
fwnode links by parsing the properties of a given fwnode.

This patch doesn't actually make any code changes. To keeps things more
digestable, the actual functional changes come in later patches in this
series.
