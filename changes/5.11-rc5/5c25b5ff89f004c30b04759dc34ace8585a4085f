workqueue: Tag bound workers with KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU

Mark the per-cpu workqueue workers as KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU.

Workqueues have unfortunate semantics in that per-cpu workers are not
default flushed and parked during hotplug, however a subset does
manual flush on hotplug and hard relies on them for correctness.

Therefore play silly games..
