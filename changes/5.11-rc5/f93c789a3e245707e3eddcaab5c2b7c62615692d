tools headers cpufeatures: Sync with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  e7b6385b01d8e9fb ("x86/cpufeatures: Add Intel SGX hardware bits")

That causes only these 'perf bench' objects to rebuild:

  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memcpy-x86-64-asm.o
  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memset-x86-64-asm.o

And addresses these perf build warnings:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h'
