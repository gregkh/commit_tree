memory: tegra30-emc: Remove unnecessary of_node_put in tegra_emc_probe

Clang warns:

  drivers/memory/tegra/tegra30-emc.c:1275:15: warning: variable 'np' is uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
                of_node_put(np);
                            ^~
  drivers/memory/tegra/tegra30-emc.c:1269:24: note: initialize the variable 'np' to silence this warning

There does not need to be an of_node_put call in this error handling
block after the shuffling of the np assignment. Remove it so there is
no use of uninitialized memory.
