usb: gadget: u_ether: Fix MTU size mismatch with RX packet size

Fix the MTU size issue with RX packet size as the host sends the packet
with extra bytes containing ethernet header. This causes failure when
user sets the MTU size to the maximum i.e. 15412. In this case the
ethernet packet received will be of length 15412 plus the ethernet header
length. This patch fixes the issue where there is a check that RX packet
length must not be more than max packet length.
