bpf: Fix helper bpf_map_peek_elem_proto pointing to wrong callback

I assume this was obtained by copy/paste. Point it to bpf_map_peek_elem()
instead of bpf_map_pop_elem(). In practice it may have been less likely
hit when under JIT given shielded via 84430d4232c3 ("bpf, verifier: avoid
retpoline for map push/pop/peek operation").

Fixes: f1a2e44a3aec ("bpf: add queue and stack maps")
