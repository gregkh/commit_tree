drm/amd/include/vega10_ip_offset: Mark _BASE structs as __maybe_unused

This patch fixes nearly 400 warnings!

These structures are too widely used in too many varying
configurations to be split-up into different headers or moved into
source files.

Instead, we'll mark them as __maybe_unused which tells the compiler
that we're aware they're being included into source files which do not
make use of them - but we've looked into it, and it's okay.

Let's tidy-up whilst were here.  Just alignment stuff.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):
