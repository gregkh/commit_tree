Modify return value of nla_strlcpy to match that of strscpy.

nla_strlcpy now returns -E2BIG if src was truncated when written to dst.
It also returns this error value if dstsize is 0 or higher than INT_MAX.

For example, if src is "foo\0" and dst is 3 bytes long, the result will be:
1. "foG" after memcpy (G means garbage).
2. "fo\0" after memset.
3. -E2BIG is returned because src was not completely written into dst.

The callers of nla_strlcpy were modified to take into account this modification.
