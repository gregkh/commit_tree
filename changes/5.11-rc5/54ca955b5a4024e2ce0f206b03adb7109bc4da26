serial: mvebu-uart: fix tx lost characters at power off

Commit c685af1108d7 ("serial: mvebu-uart: fix tx lost characters") fixed tx
lost characters at low baud rates but started causing tx lost characters
when kernel is going to power off or reboot.

TX_EMP tells us when transmit queue is empty therefore all characters were
transmitted. TX_RDY tells us when CPU can send a new character.

Therefore we need to use different check prior transmitting new character
and different check after all characters were sent.

This patch splits polling code into two functions: wait_for_xmitr() which
waits for TX_RDY and wait_for_xmite() which waits for TX_EMP.

When rebooting A3720 platform without this patch on UART is print only:
[   42.699�

And with this patch on UART is full output:
[   39.530216] reboot: Restarting system
