selftests/bpf: Add bpf_testmod kernel module for testing

Add bpf_testmod module, which is conceptually out-of-tree module and provides
ways for selftests/bpf to test various kernel module-related functionality:
raw tracepoint, fentry/fexit/fmod_ret, etc. This module will be auto-loaded by
test_progs test runner and expected by some of selftests to be present and
loaded.

Pahole currently isn't able to generate BTF for static functions in kernel
modules, so make sure traced function is global.
