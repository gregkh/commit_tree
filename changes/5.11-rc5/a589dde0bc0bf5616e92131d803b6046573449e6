btrfs: disallow mixed-bg in ZONED mode

Placing both data and metadata in a block group is impossible in ZONED
mode. For data, we can allocate a space for it and write it immediately
after the allocation. For metadata, however, we cannot do that, because
the logical addresses are recorded in other metadata buffers to build up
the trees. As a result, a data buffer can be placed after a metadata
buffer, which is not written yet. Writing out the data buffer will break
the sequential write rule.

Check and disallow MIXED_BG with ZONED mode.
