PCI/PM: Do not generate wakeup event when runtime resuming device

When a PCI bridge is runtime resumed from D3cold, we resume any downstream
devices as well.  Previously, we also generated a wakeup event for each
device even though this is not a wakeup signal coming from the hardware.

Normally this does not cause problems but when combined with
/sys/power/wakeup_count like using the steps below:

  # count=$(cat /sys/power/wakeup_count)
  # echo $count > /sys/power/wakeup_count
  # echo mem > /sys/power/state

The system suspend cycle might fail at this point if a PCI bridge that was
runtime suspended (D3cold) was runtime resumed for any reason. The runtime
resume calls pci_resume_bus(), which generates a wakeup event and increases
wakeup_count.

Since this is not a real wakeup event, remove the call to
pci_wakeup_event() from pci_resume_one().
