iommu/amd: Set iommu->int_enabled consistently when interrupts are set up

When I made the INTCAPXT support stop gratuitously pretending to be MSI,
I missed the fact that iommu_setup_msi() also sets the ->int_enabled
flag. I missed this in the iommu_setup_intcapxt() code path, which means
that a resume from suspend will try to allocate the IRQ domains again,
accidentally re-enabling interrupts as it does, resulting in much sadness.

Lift out the bit which sets iommu->int_enabled into the iommu_init_irq()
function which is also where it gets checked.
