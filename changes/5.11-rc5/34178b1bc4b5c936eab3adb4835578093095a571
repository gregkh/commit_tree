f2fs: fix compat F2FS_IOC_{MOVE,GARBAGE_COLLECT}_RANGE

Eric reported a ioctl bug in below link:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-f2fs-devel/20201103032234.GB2875@sol.localdomain/

That said, on some 32-bit architectures, u64 has only 32-bit alignment,
notably i386 and x86_32, so that size of struct f2fs_gc_range compiled
in x86_32 is 20 bytes, however the size in x86_64 is 24 bytes, binary
compiled in x86_32 can not call F2FS_IOC_GARBAGE_COLLECT_RANGE successfully
due to mismatched value of ioctl command in between binary and f2fs
module, similarly, F2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE will fail too.

In this patch we introduce two ioctls for compatibility of above special
32-bit binary:
- F2FS_IOC32_GARBAGE_COLLECT_RANGE
- F2FS_IOC32_MOVE_RANGE
