dmaengine: of-dma: Add support for optional router configuration callback

Additional configuration for the DMA event router might be needed for a
channel which can not be done during device_alloc_chan_resources callback
since the router information is not yet present for the drivers.

If there is a need for additional configuration for the channel if DMA
router is in use, then the driver can implement the device_router_config
callback.
