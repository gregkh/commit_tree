rxrpc: Don't retain the server key in the connection

Don't retain a pointer to the server key in the connection, but rather get
it on demand when the server has to deal with a response packet.

This is necessary to implement RxGK (GSSAPI-mediated transport class),
where we can't know which key we'll need until we've challenged the client
and got back the response.

This also means that we don't need to do a key search in the accept path in
softirq mode.

Also, whilst we're at it, allow the security class to ask for a kvno and
encoding-type variant of a server key as RxGK needs different keys for
different encoding types.  Keys of this type have an extra bit in the
description:

	"<service-id>:<security-index>:<kvno>:<enctype>"
