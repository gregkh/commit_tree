mac80211: don't overwrite QoS TID of injected frames

Currently ieee80211_set_qos_hdr sets the QoS TID of all frames based
on the value assigned to skb->priority. This means it will also
overwrite the QoS TID of injected frames. The commit 753ffad3d624
("mac80211: fix TID field in monitor mode transmit") prevented
injected frames from being modified because of this by setting
skb->priority to the TID of the injected frame, which assured the
QoS TID will not be changed to a different value. Unfortunately,
this workaround complicates the handling of injected frames because
we can't set skb->priority without affecting the TID value in the
QoS field of injected frames.

To avoid this, and to simplify the next patch, detect if a frame is
injected in ieee80211_set_qos_hdr and if so do not change its QoS
field.
