io_uring: close a small race gap for files cancel

The purpose of io_uring_cancel_files() is to wait for all requests
matching ->files to go/be cancelled. We should first drop files of a
request in io_req_drop_files() and only then make it undiscoverable for
io_uring_cancel_files.

First drop, then delete from list. It's ok to leave req->id->files
dangling, because it's not dereferenced by cancellation code, only
compared against. It would potentially go to sleep and be awaken by
following in io_req_drop_files() wake_up().
