crypto: arm/aes-neonbs - fix usage of cbc(aes) fallback

Loading the module deadlocks since:
-local cbc(aes) implementation needs a fallback and
-crypto API tries to find one but the request_module() resolves back to
the same module

Fix this by changing the module alias for cbc(aes) and
using the NEED_FALLBACK flag when requesting for a fallback algorithm.
