PCI/ERR: Use "bridge" for clarity in pcie_do_recovery()

pcie_do_recovery() may be called with "dev" being either a bridge (Root
Port or Switch Downstream Port) or an Endpoint.  The bulk of the function
deals with the bridge, so if we start with an Endpoint, we reset "dev" to
be the bridge leading to it.

For clarity, replace "dev" in the body of the function with "bridge".  No
functional change intended.
