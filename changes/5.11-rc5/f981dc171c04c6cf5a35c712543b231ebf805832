tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Set scaling_max_freq to base_frequency

When BIOS disables turbo, The scaling_max_freq in cpufreq sysfs will be
limited to config level 0 base frequency. But when user selects a higher
config levels, this will result in higher base frequency. But since
scaling_max_freq is still old base frequency, the performance will still
be limited. So when the turbo is disabled and cpufreq base_frequency is
higher than scaling_max_freq, update the scaling_max_freq to the
base_frequency.
