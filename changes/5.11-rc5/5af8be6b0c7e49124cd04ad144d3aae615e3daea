platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Fix the wrong variable assignment

The commit 78429e55e4057 ("platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Clean up
variable declaration") cleans up variable declaration in
video_proc_write(). Seems it does the variable assignment in the
wrong place, this results in dead code and changes the source code
logic. Fix it by doing the assignment at the beginning of the funciton.
