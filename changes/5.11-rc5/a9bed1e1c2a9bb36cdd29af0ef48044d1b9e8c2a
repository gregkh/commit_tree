selftests/vm: only some gup_test items are really benchmarks

Therefore, some minor cleanup and improvements are in order:

1. Rename the other items appropriately.

2. Stop reporting timing information on the non-benchmark items. It's
   still being recorded and is available, but there's no point in
   cluttering up the report with data that no one reasonably needs to
   check.

3. Don't do iterations, for non-benchmark items.

4. Print out a shorter, more appropriate report for the non-benchmark
   tests.

5. Add the command that was run, to the report. This really helps, as
   there are quite a lot of options now.

6. Use a larger integer type for cmd, now that it's being compared
   Otherwise it doesn't work, because in this case cmd is about 3 billion,
   which is the perfect size for problems with signed vs unsigned int.
