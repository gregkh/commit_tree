soc: xilinx: vcu: use vcu-settings syscon registers

Switch the "logicoreip" registers to the new xlnx,vcu-settings binding
to be able to read the settings if the settings are specified in a
separate device tree node that is shared with other drivers.

If the driver is not able to find a node with the new binding, fall back
to check for the logicore register bank to be backwards compatible.
