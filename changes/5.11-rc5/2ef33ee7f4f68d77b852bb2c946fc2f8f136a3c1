ACPI: scan: Add PNP0D80 to the _DEP exceptions list

The PNP0D80 ("Windows-compatible System Power Management Controller")
device ID is used for identifying the special device object providing
the LPI (Low-power S0 Idle) _DSM interface [1].  That device object
does not supply any operation regions, but it appears in _DEP lists
for other devices in the ACPI tables on some systems to enforce
specific enumeration ordering that does not matter for Linux.

For this reason, _DEP list entries pointing to the device object whose
_CID returns PNP0D80 need not be taken into account as real operation
region dependencies, so add that device ID to the list of device IDs
for which the matching _DEP list entries should be ignored.

Accordingly, update the function used for matching device IDs in that
list to allow it to check _CID as well as _HID and rename it to
acpi_info_matches_ids().
