drm/amd/display: Fix to be able to stop crc calculation

[Why]
Find out when we try to disable CRC calculation,
crc generation is still enabled. Main reason is
that dc_stream_configure_crc() will never get
called when the source is AMDGPU_DM_PIPE_CRC_SOURCE_NONE.

[How]
Add checking condition that when source is
AMDGPU_DM_PIPE_CRC_SOURCE_NONE, we should also call
dc_stream_configure_crc() to disable crc calculation.
Also, clean up crc window when disable crc calculation.
