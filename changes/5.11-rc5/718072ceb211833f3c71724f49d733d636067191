PM: domains: create debugfs nodes when adding power domains

debugfs nodes were created in genpd_debug_init alled in late_initcall
preventing power domains registered though loadable modules to have
a debugfs entry.

Create/remove debugfs nodes when the power domain is added/removed
to/from the internal gpd_list.
