torture: Make torture_stutter() use hrtimer

The torture_stutter() function uses schedule_timeout_interruptible()
to time the stutter duration, but this can miss race conditions due to
its being time-synchronized with everything else that is based on the
timer wheels.  This commit therefore converts torture_stutter() to use
the high-resolution timers via schedule_hrtimeout(), and also to fuzz
the stutter interval.  While in the area, this commit also limits the
spin-loop portion of the stutter_wait() function's wait loop to two
jiffies, down from about one second.
