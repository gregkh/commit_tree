ALSA: usb-audio: Fix UBSAN warnings for MIDI jacks

The calculation of in_cables and out_cables bitmaps are done with the
bit shift by the value from the descriptor, which is an arbitrary
value, and can lead to UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warnings.

Fix it by filtering the bad descriptor values with the check of the
upper bound 0x10 (the cable bitmaps are 16 bits).
