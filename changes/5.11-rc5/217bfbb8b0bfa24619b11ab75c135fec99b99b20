ALSA: seq: oss: Fix missing error check in snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info()

snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info() didn't check the error code from
snd_seq_oss_midi_make_info(), and this leads to the call of strlcpy()
with the uninitialized string as the source, which may lead to the
access over the limit.

Add the proper error check for avoiding the failure.
