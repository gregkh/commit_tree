ALSA/hda: apply jack fixup for the Acer Veriton N4640G/N6640G/N2510G

This Acer Veriton N4640G/N6640G/N2510G desktops have 2 headphone
jacks(front and rear), and a separate Mic In jack.

The rear headphone jack is actually a line out jack but always silent
while playing audio. The front 'Mic In' also fails the jack sensing.
Apply the ALC269_FIXUP_LIFEBOOK to have all audio jacks to work as
expected.
