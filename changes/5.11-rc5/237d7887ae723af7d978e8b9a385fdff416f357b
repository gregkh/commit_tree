xfs: show the proper user quota options

The quota option 'usrquota' should be shown if both the XFS_UQUOTA_ACCT
and XFS_UQUOTA_ENFD flags are set. The option 'uqnoenforce' should be
shown when only the XFS_UQUOTA_ACCT flag is set. The current code logic
seems wrong, Fix it and show proper options.
