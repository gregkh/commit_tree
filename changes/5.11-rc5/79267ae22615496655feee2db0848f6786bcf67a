net: mscc: ocelot: allow offloading of bridge on top of LAG

The blamed commit was too aggressive, and it made ocelot_netdevice_event
react only to network interface events emitted for the ocelot switch
ports.

In fact, only the PRECHANGEUPPER should have had that check.

When we ignore all events that are not for us, we miss the fact that the
upper of the LAG changes, and the bonding interface gets enslaved to a
bridge. This is an operation we could offload under certain conditions.
