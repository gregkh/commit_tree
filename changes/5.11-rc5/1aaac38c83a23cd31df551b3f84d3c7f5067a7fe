btrfs: don't allow tree block to cross page boundary for subpage support

As a preparation for subpage sector size support (allowing filesystem
with sector size smaller than page size to be mounted) if the sector
size is smaller than page size, we don't allow tree block to be read if
it crosses 64K(*) boundary.

The 64K is selected because:

- we are only going to support 64K page size for subpage for now
- 64K is also the maximum supported node size

This ensures that tree blocks are always contained in one page for a
system with 64K page size, which can greatly simplify the handling.

Otherwise we would have to do complex multi-page handling of tree
blocks.  Currently there is no way to create such tree blocks.

In kernel we have avoided such tree blocks allocation even on 4K page
size, as it can lead to RAID56 stripe scrubbing.

While btrfs-progs have fixed its chunk allocator since 2016 for convert,
and has extra checks to do the same behavior as the kernel.

Just add such graceful checks in case of an ancient filesystem.
