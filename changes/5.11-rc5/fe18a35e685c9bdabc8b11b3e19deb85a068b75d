powerpc/64: Fix an EMIT_BUG_ENTRY in head_64.S

Commit 63ce271b5e37 ("powerpc/prom: convert PROM_BUG() to standard
trap") added an EMIT_BUG_ENTRY for the trap after the branch to
start_kernel(). The EMIT_BUG_ENTRY was for the address "0b", however the
trap was not labeled with "0". Hence the address used for bug is in
relative_toc() where the previous "0" label is. Label the trap as "0" so
the correct address is used.
