net: ipa: record IPA version in GSI structure

Record the IPA version passed to gsi_init() in the GSI structure.
This allows that value to be used directly where needed, rather than
passing and storing certain flag arguments through the code.

In particular, for all but one supported version of IPA, the command
channel is programmed to only use an "escape buffer".  By storing
the IPA version, we can do a simple version check in one location,
and avoid storing a flag field in every channel (and passing a flag
along while initializing channels to set that field properly).
