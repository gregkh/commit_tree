Bluetooth: hci_qca: Enhance retry logic in qca_setup

Currently driver only retries to download FW if FW downloading
is failed. Sometimes observed command timeout for version request
command, if this happen on some platforms during boot time, then
a reboot is needed to turn ON BT. Instead to avoid a reboot, now
extended retry logic for version request command too.
