btrfs: skip unnecessary searches for xattrs when logging an inode

Every time we log an inode we lookup in the fs/subvol tree for xattrs and
if we have any, log them into the log tree. However it is very common to
have inodes without any xattrs, so doing the search wastes times, but more
importantly it adds contention on the fs/subvol tree locks, either making
the logging code block and wait for tree locks or making the logging code
making other concurrent operations block and wait.

The most typical use cases where xattrs are used are when capabilities or
ACLs are defined for an inode, or when SELinux is enabled.

This change makes the logging code detect when an inode does not have
xattrs and skip the xattrs search the next time the inode is logged,
unless the inode is evicted and loaded again or a xattr is added to the
inode. Therefore skipping the search for xattrs on inodes that don't ever
have xattrs and are fsynced with some frequency.

The following script that calls dbench was used to measure the impact of
this change on a VM with 8 CPUs, 16Gb of ram, using a raw NVMe device
directly (no intermediary filesystem on the host) and using a non-debug
kernel (default configuration on Debian distributions):

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdk
  MNT=/mnt/sdk
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"

  mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -d single $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 200 40

  umount $MNT
