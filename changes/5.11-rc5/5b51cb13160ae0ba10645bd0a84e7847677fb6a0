KVM: SVM: Add support for CR4 write traps for an SEV-ES guest

For SEV-ES guests, the interception of control register write access
is not recommended. Control register interception occurs prior to the
control register being modified and the hypervisor is unable to modify
the control register itself because the register is located in the
encrypted register state.

SEV-ES guests introduce new control register write traps. These traps
provide intercept support of a control register write after the control
register has been modified. The new control register value is provided in
the VMCB EXITINFO1 field, allowing the hypervisor to track the setting
of the guest control registers.

Add support to track the value of the guest CR4 register using the control
register write trap so that the hypervisor understands the guest operating
mode.
