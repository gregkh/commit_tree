watchdog: sbc_fitpc2_wdt: add __user annotations

After a change to the put_user() macro on x86, kernel test robot has
started sending me complaints (from sparse) about passing kernel
pointers to put_user(). So add the __user annotations to the various
casts in fitpc2_wdt_ioctl(), and while in here, also make the write
method actually match the prototype of file_operations::write.
