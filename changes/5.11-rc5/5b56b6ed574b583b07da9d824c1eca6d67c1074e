block: refactor blkdev_get

Move more code that is only run on the outer open but not the open of
the underlying whole device when opening a partition into blkdev_get,
which leads to a much easier to follow structure.

This allows to simplify the disk and module refcounting so that one
reference is held for each open, similar to what we do with normal
file operations.
