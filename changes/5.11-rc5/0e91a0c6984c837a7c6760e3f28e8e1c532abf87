mm/highmem: Provide CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP

CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL, which is selected by CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM is only
providing guard pages, but does not provide a mechanism to enforce the
usage of the kmap_local() infrastructure.

Provide CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP which forces the temporary
mapping even for lowmem pages. This needs to be a seperate config switch
because this only works on architectures which do not have cache aliasing
problems.
