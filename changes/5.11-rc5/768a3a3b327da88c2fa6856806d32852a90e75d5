ASoC: Intel: catpt: Optimize applying user settings

Initial user settings such as volume control need to be applied only
once after stream is allocated. As prepare() operation can be invoked
multiple times during the stream's lifetime, relocate
catpt_dai_apply_usettings() and call it directly within
catpt_dai_hw_params() rather than on every catpt_dai_prepare().

catpt_dai_apply_usettings() remains unchanged.
