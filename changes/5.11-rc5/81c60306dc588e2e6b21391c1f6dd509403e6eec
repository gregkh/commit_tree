kunit: tool: fix minor typing issue with None status

The code to handle aggregating statuses didn't check that the status
actually got set to some non-None value.
Default the value to SUCCESS instead of adding a bunch of `is None`
checks.

This sorta follows the precedent in commit 3fc48259d525 ("kunit: Don't
fail test suites if one of them is empty").

Also slightly simplify the code and add type annotations.
