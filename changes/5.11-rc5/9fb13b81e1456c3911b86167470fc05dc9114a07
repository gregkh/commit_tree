ath11k: Fix single phy hw mode

driver not able to bootup in the single radio configured board.
single phy hw mode is converted to invalid hw mode and sent to FW
through wmi init cmd. In that case driver is not receiving wmi
ready event which leads to driver bootup fail. single phy hw mode
is a valid for single radio configured board. so removed the
conversion logic.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-01238-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-2
