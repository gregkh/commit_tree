ALSA: usb-audio: Fix the missing endpoints creations for quirks

The recent change in the endpoint management moved the endpoint object
creation from the stream open time to the parser of the audio
descriptor.  It works fine for the standard audio, but it overlooked
the other places that create audio streams via quirks
(QUIRK_AUDIO_FIXED_ENDPOINT) like the reported a few Pioneer devices;
those call snd_usb_add_audio_stream() manually, hence they miss the
endpoints, eventually resulting in the error at opening streams.
Moreover, now the sync EP setup was moved to the explicit call of
snd_usb_audioformat_set_sync_ep(), and this needs to be added for
those places, too.

This patch addresses those regressions for quirks.  It adds a local
helper function add_audio_stream_from_fixed_fmt(), which does the all
needed tasks, and replaces the calls of snd_usb_add_audio_stream()
with this new function.
