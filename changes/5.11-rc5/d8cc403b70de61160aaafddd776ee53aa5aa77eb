RDMA/hns: Simplify AEQE process for different types of queue

There is no need to get queue number repeatly for different queues from an
AEQE entity, as they are the same. Furthermore, redefine the AEQE
structure to make the codes more readable.

In addition, HNS_ROCE_EVENT_TYPE_CEQ_OVERFLOW is removed because the
hardware never reports this event.
