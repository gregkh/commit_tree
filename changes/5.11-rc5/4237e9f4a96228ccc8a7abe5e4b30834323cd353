selftests/bpf: Add verifier test for PTR_TO_MEM spill

Add a test to check that the verifier is able to recognize spilling of
PTR_TO_MEM registers, by reserving a ringbuf buffer, forcing the spill
of a pointer holding the buffer address to the stack, filling it back
in from the stack and writing to the memory area pointed by it.

The patch was partially contributed by CyberArk Software, Inc.
