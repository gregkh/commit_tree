x86/msi: Provide msi message shadow structs

Create shadow structs with named bitfields for msi_msg data, address_lo and
address_hi and use them in the MSI message composer.

Provide a function to retrieve the destination ID. This could be inline,
but that'd create a circular header dependency.

[dwmw2: fix bitfields not all to be a union]
