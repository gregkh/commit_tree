RDMA: Manual changes for sysfs_emit and neatening

Make changes to use sysfs_emit in the RDMA code as cocci scripts can not
be written to handle _all_ the possible variants of various sprintf family
uses in sysfs show functions.

While there, make the code more legible and update its style to be more
like the typical kernel styles.

Miscellanea:

o Use intermediate pointers for dereferences
o Add and use string lookup functions
o return early when any intermediate call fails so normal return is
  at the bottom of the function
o mlx4/mcg.c:sysfs_show_group: use scnprintf to format intermediate strings
