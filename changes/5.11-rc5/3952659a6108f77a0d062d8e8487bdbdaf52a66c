staging: greybus: codecs: Fix reference counter leak in error handling

gb_pm_runtime_get_sync has increased the usage counter of the device here.
Forgetting to call gb_pm_runtime_put_noidle will result in usage counter
leak in the error branch of (gbcodec_hw_params and gbcodec_prepare). We
fixed it by adding it.
