erofs: get rid of magical Z_EROFS_MAPPING_STAGING

Previously, we played around with magical page->mapping for short-lived
temporary pages since we need to identify different types of pages in
the same pcluster but both invalidated and short-lived temporary pages
can have page->mapping == NULL. It was considered as safe because that
temporary pages are all non-LRU / non-movable pages.

This patch tends to use specific page->private to identify short-lived
pages instead so it won't rely on page->mapping anymore. Details are
described in "compress.h" as well.
