iio: sx9310: Fix semtech,avg-pos-strength setting when > 16

This DT property can be 0, 16, and then 64, but not 32. The math here
doesn't recognize this slight bump in the power of 2 numbers and
translates a DT property of 64 into the register value '3' when it
really should be '2'. Fix it by subtracting one more if the number being
translated is larger than 31. Also use clamp() because we're here.
