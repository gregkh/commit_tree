scsi: ibmvfc: Add new fields for version 2 of several MADs

Introduce a target_wwpn field to several MADs. Its possible that a SCSI ID
of a target can change due to some fabric changes. The WWPN of the SCSI
target provides a better way to identify the target. Also, add flags for
receiving MAD versioning information and advertising client support for
targetWWPN with the VIOS. This latter capability flag will be required for
future clients capable of requesting multiple hardware queues from the host
adapter.
