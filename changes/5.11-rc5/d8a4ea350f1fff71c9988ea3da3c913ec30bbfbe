octeontx2-af: Fix undetected unmap PF error check

Currently the check for an unmap PF error is always going to be false
because intr_val is a 32 bit int and is being bit-mask checked against
1ULL << 32.  Fix this by making intr_val a u64 to match the type at it
is copied from, namely npa_event_context->npa_af_rvu_ge.
