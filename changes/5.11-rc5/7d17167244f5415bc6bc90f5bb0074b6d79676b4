selftests/bpf: Print reason when a tester could not run a program

Commit 8184d44c9a57 ("selftests/bpf: skip verifier tests for unsupported
program types") added a check to skip unsupported program types. As
bpf_probe_prog_type can change errno, do_single_test should save it before
printing a reason why a supported BPF program type failed to load.
