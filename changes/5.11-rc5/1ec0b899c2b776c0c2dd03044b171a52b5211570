media: ccs: Add the generator for CCS register definitions and limits

Add register definitions of the MIPI CCS 1.1 standard.

The CCS driver makes extended use of device's capability registers that
are dependent on CCS version. This involves having an in-memory data
structure for limit and capability information, creating that data
structure and accessing it.

The register definitions as well as the definitions of this data structure
are generated from a text file using a Perl script. Add the generator
script to make it easy to update the generated files.
