Driver core: platform: Add extra error check in devm_platform_get_irqs_affinity()

The current check of nvec < minvec for nvec returned from
platform_irq_count() will not detect a negative error code in nvec.

This is because minvec is unsigned, and, as such, nvec is promoted to
unsigned in that check, which will make it a huge number (if it contained
-EPROBE_DEFER).

In practice, an error should not occur in nvec for the only in-tree
user, but add a check anyway.
