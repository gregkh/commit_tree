perf stat: Introduce struct runtime_stat_data

To pass more info to the saved_value in the runtime_stat, add a new
struct runtime_stat_data.  Currently it only has 'ctx' field but later
patch will add more.

Note that we intentionally pass 0 as ctx to clock-related events for
compatibility.  It was already there in a few places.  So move the code
into the saved_value_lookup() explicitly and add a comment.
