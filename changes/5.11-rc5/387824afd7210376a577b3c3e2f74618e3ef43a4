btrfs: use the right number of levels for lockdep keysets

BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL is 8 and the keyset table is supposed to have a key for
each level, but we'll never have more than 8 levels.  The values passed
to btrfs_set_buffer_lockdep_class are always derived from a valid extent
buffer.  Set the array sizes to the right value.
