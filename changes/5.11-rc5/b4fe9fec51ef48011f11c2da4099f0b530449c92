selftests/bpf: Silence ima_setup.sh when not running in verbose mode.

Currently, ima_setup.sh spews outputs from commands like mkfs and dd
on the terminal without taking into account the verbosity level of
the test framework. Update test_progs to set the environment variable
SELFTESTS_VERBOSE=1 when a verbose output is requested. This
environment variable is then used by ima_setup.sh (and can be used by
other similar scripts) to obey the verbosity level of the test harness
without needing to re-implement command line options for verbosity.

In "silent" mode, the script saves the output to a temporary file, the
contents of which are echoed back to stderr when the script encounters
an error.
