nvme-fabrics: reject I/O to offline device

Commands get stuck while Host NVMe-oF controller is in reconnect state.
The controller enters into reconnect state when it loses connection with
the target.  It tries to reconnect every 10 seconds (default) until
a successful reconnect or until the reconnect time-out is reached.
The default reconnect time out is 10 minutes.

Applications are expecting commands to complete with success or error
within a certain timeout (30 seconds by default).  The NVMe host is
enforcing that timeout while it is connected, but during reconnect the
timeout is not enforced and commands may get stuck for a long period or
even forever.

To fix this long delay due to the default timeout, introduce new
"fast_io_fail_tmo" session parameter.  The timeout is measured in seconds
from the controller reconnect and any command beyond that timeout is
rejected.  The new parameter value may be passed during 'connect'.
The default value of -1 means no timeout (similar to current behavior).
