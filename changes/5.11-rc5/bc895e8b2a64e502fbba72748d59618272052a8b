bpf: Fix signed_{sub,add32}_overflows type handling

Fix incorrect signed_{sub,add32}_overflows() input types (and a related buggy
comment). It looks like this might have slipped in via copy/paste issue, also
given prior to 3f50f132d840 ("bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking")
the signature of signed_sub_overflows() had s64 a and s64 b as its input args
whereas now they are truncated to s32. Thus restore proper types. Also, the case
of signed_add32_overflows() is not consistent to signed_sub32_overflows(). Both
have s32 as inputs, therefore align the former.
