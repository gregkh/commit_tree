checkpatch: add fix option for ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS

Currently, checkpatch warns us if an assignment operator is placed at the
start of a line and not at the end of previous line.

E.g., running checkpatch on commit 8195b1396ec8 ("hv_netvsc: fix
deadlock on hotplug") reports:

  CHECK: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
  +	struct netvsc_device *nvdev
  +		= container_of(w, struct netvsc_device, subchan_work);

Provide a simple fix by appending assignment operator to the previous
line and removing from the current line, if both the lines are additions
(ie start with '+')
