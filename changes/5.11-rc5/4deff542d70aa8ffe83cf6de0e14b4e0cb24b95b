media: adv748x: Only set i2c addresses once during probe

During probe the i2c slave addresses are set two times in a row, once in
adv748x_initialise_clients() and once directly after in adv748x_reset().
Remove the call to adv748x_set_slave_addresses() in
adv748x_initialise_clients() as it's only called during probe while
adv748x_reset() is called during probe and normal operation.
