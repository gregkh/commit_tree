nvme-pci: mark Samsung PM1725a as IGNORE_DEV_SUBNQN

A system with more than one of these SSDs will only have one usable.
Hence the kernel fails to detect nvme devices due to duplicate cntlids.

[    6.274554] nvme nvme1: Duplicate cntlid 33 with nvme0, rejecting
[    6.274566] nvme nvme1: Removing after probe failure status: -22

Adding the NVME_QUIRK_IGNORE_DEV_SUBNQN quirk to resolves the issue.
