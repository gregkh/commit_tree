mmc: core: don't initialize block size from ext_csd if not present

If extended CSD was not available, the eMMC driver would incorrectly
set the block size to 0, as the data_sector_size field of ext_csd
was never initialized. This issue was exposed by commit 817046ecddbc
("block: Align max_hw_sectors to logical blocksize") which caused
max_sectors and max_hw_sectors to be set to 0 after setting the block
size to 0, resulting in a kernel panic in bio_split when attempting
to read from the device. Fix it by only reading the block size from
ext_csd if it is available.
