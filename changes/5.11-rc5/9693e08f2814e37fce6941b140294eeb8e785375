net: ipa: fix build-time bug in ipa_hardware_config_qsb()

Jon Hunter reported observing a build bug in the IPA driver:
  https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/5b5d9d40-94d5-5dad-b861-fd9bef8260e2@nvidia.com

The problem is that the QMB0 max read value set for IPA v4.5 (16) is
too large to fit in the 4-bit field.

The actual value we want is 0, which requests that the hardware use
the maximum it is capable of.
