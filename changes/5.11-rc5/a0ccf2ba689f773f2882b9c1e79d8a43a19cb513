arm64: sdei: move uaccess logic to arch/arm64/

The SDEI support code is split across arch/arm64/ and drivers/firmware/,
largley this is split so that the arch-specific portions are under
arch/arm64, and the management logic is under drivers/firmware/.
However, exception entry fixups are currently under drivers/firmware.

Let's move the exception entry fixups under arch/arm64/. This
de-clutters the management logic, and puts all the arch-specific
portions in one place. Doing this also allows the fixups to be applied
earlier, so things like PAN and UAO will be in a known good state before
we run other logic. This will also make subsequent refactoring easier.
