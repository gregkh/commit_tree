irqchip/mips-cpu: Set IPI domain parent chip

Since commit 55567976629e ("genirq/irqdomain: Allow partial trimming of
irq_data hierarchy") the irq_data chain is valided.

The irq_domain_trim_hierarchy() function doesn't consider the irq + ipi
domain hierarchy as valid, since the ipi domain has the irq domain set
as parent, but the parent domain has no chip set. Hence the boot ends in
a kernel panic.

Set the chip for the parent domain as it is done in the mips gic irq
driver, to have a valid irq_data chain.
