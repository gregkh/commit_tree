Revert "ACPI / resources: Use AE_CTRL_TERMINATE to terminate resources walks"

This reverts commit 8a66790b7850a6669129af078768a1d42076a0ef.

Switching this function to AE_CTRL_TERMINATE broke the documented
behaviour of acpi_dev_get_resources() - AE_CTRL_TERMINATE does not, in
fact, terminate the resource walk because acpi_walk_resource_buffer()
ignores it (specifically converting it to AE_OK), referring to that
value as "an OK termination by the user function". This means that
acpi_dev_get_resources() does not abort processing when the preproc
function returns a negative value.
