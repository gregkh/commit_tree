drm/kmb: Add support for KeemBay Display

This is a basic KMS atomic modesetting display driver for KeemBay family of
SOCs. Driver has no 2D or 3D graphics. It calls into the ADV bridge
driver at the connector level.

Single CRTC with LCD controller->mipi DSI->ADV bridge

Only 1080p resolution and single plane is supported at this time.
