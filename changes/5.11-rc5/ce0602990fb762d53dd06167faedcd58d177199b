PCI: vmd: Update type of the __iomem pointers

Use "void __iomem" instead "char __iomem" pointer type when working with
the accessor functions (with names like readb() or writel(), etc.) to
better match a given accessor function signature where commonly the address
pointing to an I/O memory region would be a "void __iomem" pointer.
