driver core: auxiliary bus: Fix auxiliary bus shutdown null auxdrv ptr

If the probe of the auxdrv failed, the device->driver is set to NULL.
During kernel shutdown, the bus shutdown will call auxdrv->shutdown and
cause an invalid ptr dereference. Add check to make sure device->driver is
not NULL before we proceed.
