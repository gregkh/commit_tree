net: bridge: explicitly convert between mdb entry state and port group flags

When creating a new multicast port group, there is implicit conversion
between the __u8 state member of struct br_mdb_entry and the unsigned
char flags member of struct net_bridge_port_group. This implicit
conversion relies on the fact that MDB_PERMANENT is equal to
MDB_PG_FLAGS_PERMANENT.

Let's be more explicit and convert the state to flags manually.
