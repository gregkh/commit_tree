s390/head: set io/ext handlers to disabled wait

Set io/ext handlers to disabled wait in the initial lowcore, so that they
are effective right from the kernel start, when a boot method used does
not rewrite this part of the lowcore for its own needs (i.e. kexec, z/vm
ipl reader boot, qemu direct boot, load from removable media or server).

When the kernel is loaded by zipl, scsi loader or qemu loader, some or
all of the io/ext/pgm handlers addresses might be rewritten. Rewrite them
to initial values again as early as possible.
