ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_nau8824: Change SSP2-Codec DAI id to 0

The snd-soc-sst-acpi driver does not care about the id specified for
the SSP2-Codec DAI, but it does matter for the snd-sof-acpi driver;
and when it is not 0 then the snd-sof-acpi driver does not work.

Set the SSP2-Codec DAI id to 0, fixing the snd-sof-acpi driver not
working on devices using the cht_bsw_nau8824 machine-driver.
