net: hns3: adjust rss tc mode configure command

For the max rss size of PF may be up to 512, the max queue
number of single tc may be up to 512 too. For the total queue
numbers may be up to 1280, so the queue offset of each tc may
be more than 1024. So adjust the rss tc mode configuration
command, including extend tc size field from 10 bits to 11
bits, and extend tc size field from 3 bits to 4 bits.
