dmaengine: ti: k3-psil: Extend psil_endpoint_config for K3 PKTDMA

Additional fields needed for K3 PKTDMA to be able to handle the mapped
channels (channels are locked to handle specific threads) and flow ranges
for these mapped threads.
PKTDMA also introduces tflow for tx channels which can not be found in
K3 UDMA architecture.
