mm, page_poison: remove CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_NO_SANITY

CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_NO_SANITY skips the check on page alloc whether the
poison pattern was corrupted, suggesting a use-after-free.  The motivation
to introduce it in commit 8823b1dbc05f ("mm/page_poison.c: enable
PAGE_POISONING as a separate option") was to simply sanitize freed pages,
optimally together with CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO.

These days we have an init_on_free=1 boot option, which makes this use
case of page poisoning redundant.  For sanitizing, writing zeroes is
sufficient, there is pretty much no benefit from writing the 0xAA poison
pattern to freed pages, without checking it back on alloc.  Thus, remove
this option and suggest init_on_free instead in the main config's help.
