media: stm32-dcmi: remove deprecated dmaengine_terminate_all()

Replace dmaengine_terminate_all() by dmaengine_terminate_sync()
to ensure that all pending dma operations are really finished.
This is not ensured by dmaengine_terminate_all() and this API
is deprecated, so better to use the _sync() variant.
