crypto: arm64/gcm - move authentication tag check to SIMD domain

Instead of copying the calculated authentication tag to memory and
calling crypto_memneq() to verify it, use vector bytewise compare and
min across vector instructions to decide whether the tag is valid. This
is more efficient, and given that the tag is only transiently held in a
NEON register, it is also safer, given that calculated tags for failed
decryptions should be withheld.
