scsi: mpt3sas: Update hba_port's sas_address & phy_mask

Update hba_port's sas_address & phy_mask fields whenever a direct expander
or sas/sata target devices are added or removed.

When any direct attached device is discovered then driver:

 - Gets the hba_port object corresponding to device's PhysicalPort
   number;

 - Updates the hba_port's sas_address field with device's SAS
   Address;

 - Updates the hba_port's phy_mask filed with device's narrow/wide
   port Phy number bits;

 - If a sas/sata end device (not only direct-attached devices) is added
   then corresponding sas_device object's port variable is assigned with
   hba_port object's address whose port_id matches the device's
   PhysicalPort number.

 - If an expander device is added then corresponding sas_expander object's
   port variable is assigned with hba_port object's address whose port_id
   matches the expander device's PhysicalPort number.

When any direct attached device is detached then driver will delete the
hba_port object corresponding to device's PhysicalPort number.

Whenever any HBA phy's link (of direct attached device's port) comes up
then update the phy_mask field of corresponding hba_port object.
