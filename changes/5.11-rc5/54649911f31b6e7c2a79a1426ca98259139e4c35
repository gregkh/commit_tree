efi: stub: get rid of efi_get_max_fdt_addr()

Now that ARM started following the example of arm64 and RISC-V, and
no longer imposes any restrictions on the placement of the FDT in
memory at boot, we no longer need per-arch implementations of
efi_get_max_fdt_addr() to factor out the differences. So get rid of
it.
