clk: imx: scu: fix build break when compiled as modules

After commit e0d0d4d86c76 ("clk: imx8qxp: Support building i.MX8QXP clock
driver as module"), clk-scu.c and clk-imx8qxp.c are complied in one module,
thus there can be only one module_init() in those two files.
Commit 77d8f3068c63 ("clk: imx: scu: add two cells binding support")
introduced another module_init() in clk_scu.c which caused the errors
below.

To fix the issue, we can remove the unnecessary builtin_platform_driver
from clk_scu.c and directly register the driver in imx_clk_scu_init().
