RDMA/core: remove use of dma_virt_ops

Use the ib_dma_* helpers to skip the DMA translation instead.  This
removes the last user if dma_virt_ops and keeps the weird layering
violation inside the RDMA core instead of burderning the DMA mapping
subsystems with it.  This also means the software RDMA drivers now don't
have to mess with DMA parameters that are not relevant to them at all, and
that in the future we can use PCI P2P transfers even for software RDMA, as
there is no first fake layer of DMA mapping that the P2P DMA support.
