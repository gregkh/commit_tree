drm/i915/display: Rename pipe_timings to transcoder_timings

No functional changes in this patch.

With Bigjoiner, there are 2 pipes driving 2 halfs of 1
transcoder. The transcoder_mode has the full timings, and is used
for configuring the transcoder with the intended mode after
joining the 2 halves.
To clear the confusion, we rename intel_set_pipe_timings to
intel_set_transcoder_timings

v2:
* Split the renaming into separate patch (Ville)
