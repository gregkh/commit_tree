btrfs: use cached value of fs_info::csum_size everywhere

btrfs_get_16 shows up in the system performance profiles (helper to read
16bit values from on-disk structures). This is partially because of the
checksum size that's frequently read along with data reads/writes, other
u16 uses are from item size or directory entries.

Replace all calls to btrfs_super_csum_size by the cached value from
fs_info.
