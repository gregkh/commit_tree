clk: ingenic: Fix divider calculation with div tables

The previous code assumed that a higher hardware value always resulted
in a bigger divider, which is correct for the regular clocks, but is
an invalid assumption when a divider table is provided for the clock.

Perfect example of this is the PLL0_HALF clock, which applies a /2
divider with the hardware value 0, and a /1 divider otherwise.
