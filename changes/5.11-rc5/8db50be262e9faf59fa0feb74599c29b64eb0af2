Documentation: kunit: include example of a parameterized test

Commit fadb08e7c750 ("kunit: Support for Parameterized Testing")
introduced support but lacks documentation for how to use it.

This patch builds on commit 1f0e943df68a ("Documentation: kunit: provide
guidance for testing many inputs") to show a minimal example of the new
feature.
