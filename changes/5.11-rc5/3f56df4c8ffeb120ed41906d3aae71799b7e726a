media: sunxi-cir: ensure IR is handled when it is continuous

If a user holds a button down on a remote, then no ir idle interrupt will
be generated until the user releases the button, depending on how quickly
the remote repeats. No IR is processed until that point, which means that
holding down a button may not do anything.

This also resolves an issue on a Cubieboard 1 where the IR receiver is
picking up ambient infrared as IR and spews out endless
"rc rc0: IR event FIFO is full!" messages unless you choose to live in
the dark.
