net/mlx5: DR, Free unused buddy ICM memory

Track buddy's used ICM memory, and free it if all
of the buddy's memory bacame unused.
Do this only for STEs.
MODIFY_ACTION buddies are much smaller, so in case there
is a large amount of modify_header actions, which result
in large amount of MODIFY_ACTION buddies, doing this
cleanup during sync will result in performance hit while
not freeing significant amount of memory.
