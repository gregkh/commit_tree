tcp: correctly handle increased zerocopy args struct size

A prior patch increased the size of struct tcp_zerocopy_receive
but did not update do_tcp_getsockopt() handling to properly account
for this.

This patch simply reintroduces content erroneously cut from the
referenced prior patch that handles the new struct size.
