kvm: x86/mmu: Add existing trace points to TDP MMU

The TDP MMU was initially implemented without some of the usual
tracepoints found in mmu.c. Correct this discrepancy by adding the
missing trace points to the TDP MMU.

Tested: ran the demand paging selftest on an Intel Skylake machine with
	all the trace points used by the TDP MMU enabled and observed
	them firing with expected values.
