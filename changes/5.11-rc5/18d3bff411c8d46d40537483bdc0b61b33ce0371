btrfs: don't get an EINTR during drop_snapshot for reloc

This was partially fixed by f3e3d9cc3525 ("btrfs: avoid possible signal
interruption of btrfs_drop_snapshot() on relocation tree"), however it
missed a spot when we restart a trans handle because we need to end the
transaction.  The fix is the same, simply use btrfs_join_transaction()
instead of btrfs_start_transaction() when deleting reloc roots.
