xsk: Check need wakeup flag in sendmsg()

Add a check for need wake up in sendmsg(), so that if a user calls
sendmsg() when no wakeup is needed, do not trigger a wakeup.

To simplify the need wakeup check in the syscall, unconditionally
enable the need wakeup flag for Tx. This has a side-effect for poll();
If poll() is called for a socket without enabled need wakeup, a Tx
wakeup is unconditionally performed.

The wakeup matrix for AF_XDP now looks like:

need wakeup | poll()       | sendmsg()   | recvmsg()
------------+--------------+-------------+------------
disabled    | wake Tx      | wake Tx     | nop
enabled     | check flag;  | check flag; | check flag;
            |   wake Tx/Rx |   wake Tx   |   wake Rx
