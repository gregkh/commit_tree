mm: memcontrol: add file_thp, shmem_thp to memory.stat

As huge page usage in the page cache and for shmem files proliferates in
our production environment, the performance monitoring team has asked for
per-cgroup stats on those pages.

We already track and export anon_thp per cgroup.  We already track file
THP and shmem THP per node, so making them per-cgroup is only a matter of
switching from node to lruvec counters.  All callsites are in places where
the pages are charged and locked, so page->memcg is stable.
