ALSA: usb-audio: Set sample rate for all sharing EPs on UAC1

The UAC2/3 sample rate setup is based on the clock node, which is
usually shared in the interface, and can't be re-setup without
deselecting the interface once, and that's how the current code
behaves.  OTOH, the sample rate setup of UAC1 is per endpoint, hence
we basically need to call for each endpoint usage even if those share
the same interface.

This patch fixes the behavior of UAC1 to call always
snd_usb_init_sample_rate() in snd_usb_endpoint_configure().
