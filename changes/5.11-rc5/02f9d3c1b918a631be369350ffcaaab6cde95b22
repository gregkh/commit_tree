ath11k: cold boot calibration support

cold boot calibration is the process to calibrate all the channels
during the boot-up to avoid the calibration delay during the
channel change.
During the boot-up, firmware started in cold boot calibration mode
Firmware calibrate all channels and generate CalDb(DDR).
Subsequent wifi bringup will reuse the same CalDb.
Firmware is restarted in normal mode to continue the normal operation.

caldb memory address send to firmware through the QMI message.Firmware
use this address to store the caldb data and use it until next reboot.

This will give the improvement during the channel change. But it is
increasing the boot-up time(up to 15sec depend on number of radios).
So if the user want to reduce the boot-up time and accepting for channel
change delay, user can disable this feature using the module param
cold_boot_cal=0.
