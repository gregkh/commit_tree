powerpc/vdso: Replace vdso_base by vdso

All other architectures but s390 use a void pointer named 'vdso'
to reference the VDSO mapping.

In a following patch, the VDSO data page will be put in front of
text, vdso_base will then not anymore point to VDSO text.

To avoid confusion between vdso_base and VDSO text, rename vdso_base
into vdso and make it a void __user *.
