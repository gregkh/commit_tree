s390: make sure vmemmap is top region table entry aligned

Since commit 29d37e5b82f3 ("s390/protvirt: add ultravisor initialization")
vmax is adjusted to the ultravisor secure storage limit. This limit is
currently applied when 4-level paging is used. Later vmax is also used
to align vmemmap address to the top region table entry border. When vmax
is set to the ultravisor secure storage limit this is no longer the case.

Instead of changing vmax, make only MODULES_END be affected by the
secure storage limit, so that vmax stays intact for further vmemmap
address alignment.
