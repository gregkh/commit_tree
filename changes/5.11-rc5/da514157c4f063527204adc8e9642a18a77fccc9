docs: make reporting-bugs.rst obsolete

Make various places which point to
Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-bugs.rst point to
Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst instead. That document is
brand new and as of now is not completely finished. But even at this
stage it's a lot more helpful and accurate than reporting-bugs.rst.
Hence also add a note to reporting-bugs.rst, telling people they're
better off reading reporting-issues.rst instead.

reporting-bugs.rst is scheduled for removal once reporting-issues.rst
is considered ready.
