regulator: pf8x00: Use specific compatible strings for devices

The pf8x00 driver supports three devices, the DT compatible strings
and I2C IDs should enumerate these specifically rather than using a
wildcard so that we don't collide with anything incompatible in the
same ID range in the future and so that we can handle any software
visible differences between the variants we find.
