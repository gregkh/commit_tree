x86/CPU/AMD: Save AMD NodeId as cpu_die_id

AMD systems provide a "NodeId" value that represents a global ID
indicating to which "Node" a logical CPU belongs. The "Node" is a
physical structure equivalent to a Die, and it should not be confused
with logical structures like NUMA nodes. Logical nodes can be adjusted
based on firmware or other settings whereas the physical nodes/dies are
fixed based on hardware topology.

The NodeId value can be used when a physical ID is needed by software.

Save the AMD NodeId to struct cpuinfo_x86.cpu_die_id. Use the value
from CPUID or MSR as appropriate. Default to phys_proc_id otherwise.
Do so for both AMD and Hygon systems.

Drop the node_id parameter from cacheinfo_*_init_llc_id() as it is no
longer needed.

Update the x86 topology documentation.
