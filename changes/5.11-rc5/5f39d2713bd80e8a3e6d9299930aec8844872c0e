SUNRPC: Move the svc_xdr_recvfrom tracepoint again

Commit 156708adf2d9 ("SUNRPC: Move the svc_xdr_recvfrom()
tracepoint") tried to capture the correct XID in the trace record,
but this line in svc_recv:

	rqstp->rq_xid = svc_getu32(&rqstp->rq_arg.head[0]);

alters the size of rq_arg.head[0].iov_len. The tracepoint records
the correct XID but an incorrect value for the length of the
xdr_buf's head.

To keep the trace callsites simple, I've created two trace classes.
One assumes the xdr_buf contains a full RPC message, and the XID
can be extracted from it. The other assumes the contents of the
xdr_buf are arbitrary, and the xid will be provided by the caller.

Currently there is only one user of each class, but I expect we will
need a few more tracepoints using each class as time goes on.
