net: dsa: Add tag handling for Hirschmann Hellcreek switches

The Hirschmann Hellcreek TSN switches have a special tagging protocol for frames
exchanged between the CPU port and the master interface. The format is a one
byte trailer indicating the destination or origin port.

It's quite similar to the Micrel KSZ tagging. That's why the implementation is
based on that code.
