block: remove i_bdev

Switch the block device lookup interfaces to directly work with a dev_t
so that struct block_device references are only acquired by the
blkdev_get variants (and the blk-cgroup special case).  This means that
we now don't need an extra reference in the inode and can generally
simplify handling of struct block_device to keep the lookups contained
in the core block layer code.
