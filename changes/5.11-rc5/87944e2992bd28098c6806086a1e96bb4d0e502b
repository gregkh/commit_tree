mm: Introduce page memcg flags

The lowest bit in page->memcg_data is used to distinguish between struct
memory_cgroup pointer and a pointer to a objcgs array.  All checks and
modifications of this bit are open-coded.

Let's formalize it using page memcg flags, defined in enum
page_memcg_data_flags.

Additional flags might be added later.
