soc: mediatek: Check if power domains can be powered on at boot time

In the error case, where a power domain cannot be powered on
successfully at boot time (in mtk_register_power_domains),
pm_genpd_init would still be called with is_off=false, and the
system would later try to disable the power domain again, triggering
warnings as disabled clocks are disabled again (and other potential
issues).

Also print a warning splat in that case, as this should never
happen.
