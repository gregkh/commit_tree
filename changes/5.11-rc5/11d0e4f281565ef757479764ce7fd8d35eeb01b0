arm64: dts: qcom: c630: Polish i2c-hid devices

The numbering of the i2c busses differs from ACPI and a number of typos
was made in the original patch. Further more the irq flags for the
various resources was not correct and i2c3 only has one of the two
client devices active in any one device.

Also label the various devices, for easier comparison with the ACPI
tables.
