nexthop: Emit a notification when a nexthop group is modified

When a single nexthop is replaced, the configuration of all the groups
using the nexthop is effectively modified. In this case, emit a
notification in the nexthop notification chain for each modified group
so that listeners would not need to keep track of which nexthops are
member in which groups.

The notification can only be emitted after the new configuration (i.e.,
'struct nh_info') is pointed at by the old shell (i.e., 'struct
nexthop'). Before that the configuration of the nexthop groups is still
the same as before the replacement.
