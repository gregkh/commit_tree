io_uring: fix racy IOPOLL flush overflow

It's not safe to call io_cqring_overflow_flush() for IOPOLL mode without
hodling uring_lock, because it does synchronisation differently. Make
sure we have it.

As for io_ring_exit_work(), we don't even need it there because
io_ring_ctx_wait_and_kill() already set force flag making all overflowed
requests to be dropped.
