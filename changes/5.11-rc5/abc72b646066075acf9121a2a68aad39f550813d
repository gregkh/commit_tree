remoteproc: coredump: Add minidump functionality

This change adds a new kind of core dump mechanism which instead of dumping
entire program segments of the firmware, dumps sections of the remoteproc
memory which are sufficient to allow debugging the firmware. This function
thus uses section headers instead of program headers during creation of the
core dump elf.
