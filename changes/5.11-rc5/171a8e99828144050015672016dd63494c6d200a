drm/i915/pmu: Don't grab wakeref when enabling events

Chris found a CI report which points out calling intel_runtime_pm_get from
inside i915_pmu_enable hook is not allowed since it can be invoked from
hard irq context. This is something we knew but forgot, so lets fix it
once again.

We do this by syncing the internal book keeping with hardware rc6 counter
on driver load.

v2:
 * Always sync on parking and fully sync on init.
