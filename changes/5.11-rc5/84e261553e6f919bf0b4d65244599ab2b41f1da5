hwmon: (amd_energy) fix allocation of hwmon_channel_info config

hwmon, specifically hwmon_num_channel_attrs, expects the config
array in the hwmon_channel_info structure to be terminated by
a zero entry.  amd_energy does not honor this convention.  As
result, a KASAN warning is possible.  Fix this by adding an
additional entry and setting it to zero.

Fixes: 8abee9566b7e ("hwmon: Add amd_energy driver to report energy counters")
