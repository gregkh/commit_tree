mm/filemap.c: generic_file_buffered_read() now uses find_get_pages_contig

Convert generic_file_buffered_read() to get pages to read from in batches,
and then copy data to userspace from many pages at once - in particular,
we now don't touch any cachelines that might be contended while we're in
the loop to copy data to userspace.

This is is a performance improvement on workloads that do buffered reads
with large blocksizes, and a very large performance improvement if that
file is also being accessed concurrently by different threads.

On smaller reads (512 bytes), there's a very small performance improvement
(1%, within the margin of error).
