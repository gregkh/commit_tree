habanalabs/gaudi: add support for NIC QMANs

Initialize the QMANs that are responsible to submit doorbells to the NIC
engines. Add support for stopping and disabling them, and reset them as
part of the hard-reset procedure of GAUDI. This will allow the user to
submit work to the NICs.

Add support for receiving events on QMAN errors from the firmware.

However, the nic_ports_mask is still initialized to 0. That means this code
won't initialize the QMANs just yet. That will be in a later patch.
