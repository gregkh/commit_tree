iio: adc: stm32-adc: adapt clock duty cycle for proper operation

For proper operation, STM32 ADC should be used with a clock duty cycle
of 50%, in the range of 49% to 51%. Depending on the clock tree, divider
can be used in case clock duty cycle is out of this range.
In case clk_get_scaled_duty_cycle() returns an error, kindly apply a
divider by default (don't make the probe fail).
