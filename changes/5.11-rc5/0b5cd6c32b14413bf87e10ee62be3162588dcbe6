io_uring: fix skipping disabling sqo on exec

If there are no requests at the time __io_uring_task_cancel() is called,
tctx_inflight() returns zero and and it terminates not getting a chance
to go through __io_uring_files_cancel() and do
io_disable_sqo_submit(). And we absolutely want them disabled by the
time cancellation ends.
