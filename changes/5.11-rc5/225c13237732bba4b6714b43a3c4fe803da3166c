ARM: zynq: Fix OCM mapping to be aligned with binding on zc702

The commit f69629919942 ("dt-bindings: sram: Convert SRAM bindings to
json-schema") converted binding to yaml and some missing required
properties started to be reported. Align binding based on it.

The patch is fixing these warnings:
.../zynq-zc702.dt.yaml: sram@fffc0000: '#address-cells' is a required property
.../zynq-zc702.dt.yaml: sram@fffc0000: '#size-cells' is a required property
.../zynq-zc702.dt.yaml: sram@fffc0000: 'ranges' is a required property
>From schema: .../Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.yaml
