pm-graph v5.8

 - if wakeups occur in s2idle: "freeze time: N (-x ms waking y times) ms"

 - change FREEZELOOP and FREEZEWAKE to S2LOOP and S2WAKE for brevity

 - returns all sysfs vals to their initial state after testing

 - use the dmesg log for debugging until the test is completed,
   instrument the executeSuspend process to have a full trace,
   if test completes, formal dmesg log overwrites the debug log

 - fix CPU_ON and CPU_OFF devices in the timeline, should include [n]
