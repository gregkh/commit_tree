ASoC: SOF: Intel: fix page fault at probe if i915 init fails

The earlier commit to fix runtime PM in case i915 init fails,
introduces a possibility to hit a page fault.

snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit() is designed to be called from
dev.release(). Calling it outside device reference counting, is
not safe and may lead to calling the device_exit() function
twice. Additionally, as part of ext_bus_device_init(), the device
is also registered with snd_hdac_device_register(). Thus before
calling device_exit(), the device must be removed from device
hierarchy first.

Fix the issue by rolling back init actions by calling
hdac_device_unregister() and then releasing device with put_device().
This matches with existing code in hdac-ext module.

To complete the fix, add handling for the case where
hda_codec_load_module() returns -ENODEV, and clean up the hdac_ext
resources also in this case.

In future work, hdac-ext interface should be extended to allow clients
more flexibility to handle the life-cycle of individual devices, beyond
just the current snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_remove(), which removes all
devices.
