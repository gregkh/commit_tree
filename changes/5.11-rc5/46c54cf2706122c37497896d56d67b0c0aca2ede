platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add swap-x-y quirk for Goodix touchscreen on Estar Beauty HD tablet

The Estar Beauty HD (MID 7316R) tablet uses a Goodix touchscreen,
with the X and Y coordinates swapped compared to the LCD panel.

Add a touchscreen_dmi entry for this adding a "touchscreen-swapped-x-y"
device-property to the i2c-client instantiated for this device before
the driver binds.

This is the first entry of a Goodix touchscreen to touchscreen_dmi.c,
so far DMI quirks for Goodix touchscreen's have been added directly
to drivers/input/touchscreen/goodix.c. Currently there are 3
DMI tables in goodix.c:
1. rotated_screen[] for devices where the touchscreen is rotated
   180 degrees vs the LCD panel
2. inverted_x_screen[] for devices where the X axis is inverted
3. nine_bytes_report[] for devices which use a non standard touch
   report size

Arguably only 3. really needs to be inside the driver and the other
2 cases are better handled through the generic touchscreen DMI quirk
mechanism from touchscreen_dmi.c, which allows adding device-props to
any i2c-client. Esp. now that goodix.c is using the generic
touchscreen_properties code.

Alternative to the approach from this patch we could add a 4th
dmi_system_id table for devices with swapped-x-y axis to goodix.c,
but that seems undesirable.
