drm/i915/region: fix max size calculation

We are incorrectly limiting the max allocation size as per the mm
max_order, which is effectively the largest power-of-two that we can fit
in the region size. However, it's normal to setup the region or
allocator with a non-power-of-two size(for example 3G), which we should
already handle correctly, except it seems for the early too-big-check.

v2: make sure we also exercise the I915_BO_ALLOC_CONTIGUOUS path, which
is quite different, since for that we are actually limited by the
largest power-of-two that we can fit within the region size. (Chris)
