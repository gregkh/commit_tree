x86/{cpufeatures,msr}: Add Intel SGX Launch Control hardware bits

The SGX Launch Control hardware helps restrict which enclaves the
hardware will run.  Launch control is intended to restrict what software
can run with enclave protections, which helps protect the overall system
from bad enclaves.

For the kernel's purposes, there are effectively two modes in which the
launch control hardware can operate: rigid and flexible. In its rigid
mode, an entity other than the kernel has ultimate authority over which
enclaves can be run (firmware, Intel, etc...). In its flexible mode, the
kernel has ultimate authority over which enclaves can run.

Enable X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC to enumerate when the CPU supports SGX Launch
Control in general.

Add MSR_IA32_SGXLEPUBKEYHASH{0, 1, 2, 3}, which when combined contain a
SHA256 hash of a 3072-bit RSA public key. The hardware allows SGX enclaves
signed with this public key to initialize and run [*]. Enclaves not signed
with this key can not initialize and run.

Add FEAT_CTL_SGX_LC_ENABLED, which informs whether the SGXLEPUBKEYHASH MSRs
can be written by the kernel.

If the MSRs do not exist or are read-only, the launch control hardware is
operating in rigid mode. Linux does not and will not support creating
enclaves when hardware is configured in rigid mode because it takes away
the authority for launch decisions from the kernel. Note, this does not
preclude KVM from virtualizing/exposing SGX to a KVM guest when launch
control hardware is operating in rigid mode.
