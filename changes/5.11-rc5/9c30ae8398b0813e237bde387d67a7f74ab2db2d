tcp: fix TCP socket rehash stats mis-accounting

The previous commit 32efcc06d2a1 ("tcp: export count for rehash attempts")
would mis-account rehashing SNMP and socket stats:

  a. During handshake of an active open, only counts the first
     SYN timeout

  b. After handshake of passive and active open, stop updating
     after (roughly) TCP_RETRIES1 recurring RTOs

  c. After the socket aborts, over count timeout_rehash by 1

This patch fixes this by checking the rehash result from sk_rethink_txhash.
