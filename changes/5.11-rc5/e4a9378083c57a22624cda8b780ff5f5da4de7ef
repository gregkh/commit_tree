usb: typec: tcpm: Pass down negotiated rev to update retry count

nRetryCount was updated from 3 to 2 between PD2.0 and PD3.0 spec.
nRetryCount in "Table 6-34 Counter parameters" of the PD 2.0
spec is set to 3, whereas, nRetryCount in "Table 6-59 Counter
parameters" is set to 2.

Pass down negotiated rev in pd_transmit so that low level chip
drivers can update the retry count accordingly before attempting
packet transmission.

This helps in passing "TEST.PD.PORT.ALL.02" of the
"Power Delivery Merged" test suite which was initially failing
with "The UUT did not retransmit the message nReryCount times"

In fusb302 & tcpci drivers, by default the driver sets the retry
count to 3 (Default for PD 2.0). Update this to 2,
if the negotiated rev is PD 3.0.

In wcove, since the retry count is intentionally set to max, leaving
it as is.
