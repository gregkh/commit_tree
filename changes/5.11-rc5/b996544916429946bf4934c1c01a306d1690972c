tick: Get rid of tick_period

The variable tick_period is initialized to NSEC_PER_TICK / HZ during boot
and never updated again.

If NSEC_PER_TICK is not an integer multiple of HZ this computation is less
accurate than TICK_NSEC which has proper rounding in place.

Aside of the inaccuracy there is no reason for having this variable at
all. It's just a pointless indirection and all usage sites can just use the
TICK_NSEC constant.
