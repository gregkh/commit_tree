kasan, arm64: fix pointer tags in KASAN reports

As of the "arm64: expose FAR_EL1 tag bits in siginfo" patch, the address
that is passed to report_tag_fault has pointer tags in the format of 0x0X,
while KASAN uses 0xFX format (note the difference in the top 4 bits).

Fix up the pointer tag for kernel pointers in do_tag_check_fault by
setting them to the same value as bit 55. Explicitly use __untagged_addr()
instead of untagged_addr(), as the latter doesn't affect TTBR1 addresses.

Fixes: dceec3ff7807 ("arm64: expose FAR_EL1 tag bits in siginfo")
Fixes: 4291e9ee6189 ("kasan, arm64: print report from tag fault handler")
