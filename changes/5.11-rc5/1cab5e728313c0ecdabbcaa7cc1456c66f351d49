btrfs: merge __set_extent_bit and set_extent_bit

There are only 2 direct calls to set_extent_bit outside of extent-io -
in btrfs_find_new_delalloc_bytes and btrfs_truncate_block, the rest are
thin wrappers around __set_extent_bit. This adds unnecessary indirection
and just makes it more annoying when looking at the various extent bit
manipulation functions.  This patch renames __set_extent_bit to
set_extent_bit effectively removing a level of indirection. No
functional changes.
