i2c: i801: Fix interrupt storm from SMB_ALERT signal

Currently interrupt storm will occur from i2c-i801 after first
transaction if SMB_ALERT signal is enabled and ever asserted. It is
enough if the signal is asserted once even before the driver is loaded
and does not recover because that interrupt is not acknowledged.

This fix aims to fix it by two ways:
- Add acknowledging for the SMB_ALERT interrupt status
- Disable the SMB_ALERT interrupt on platforms where possible since the
  driver currently does not make use for it

Acknowledging resets the SMB_ALERT interrupt status on all platforms and
also should help to avoid interrupt storm on older platforms where the
SMB_ALERT interrupt disabling is not available.

For simplicity this fix reuses the host notify feature for disabling and
restoring original register value.
