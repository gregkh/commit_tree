mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware

When processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware,
the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local
ports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a
netdev.

This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when calling
netif_carrier_{on,off}().

Fix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU
port. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.
