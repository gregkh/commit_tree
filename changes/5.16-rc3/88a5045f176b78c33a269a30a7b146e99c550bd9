PM: hibernate: Fix snapshot partial write lengths

snapshot_write() is inappropriately limiting the amount of data that can
be written in cases where a partial page has already been written. For
example, one would expect to be able to write 1 byte, then 4095 bytes to
the snapshot device, and have both of those complete fully (since now
we're aligned to a page again). But what ends up happening is we write 1
byte, then 4094/4095 bytes complete successfully.

The reason is that simple_write_to_buffer()'s second argument is the
total size of the buffer, not the size of the buffer minus the offset.
Since simple_write_to_buffer() accounts for the offset in its
implementation, snapshot_write() can just pass the full page size
directly down.
