net: hns3: fix one incorrect value of page pool info when queried by debugfs

Currently, when user queries page pool info by debugfs command
"cat page_pool_info", the cnt of allocated page for page pool may be
incorrect because of memory inconsistency problem caused by compiler
optimization.

So this patch uses READ_ONCE() to read value of pages_state_hold_cnt to
fix this problem.
