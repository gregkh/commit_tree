HID: wacom: Use "Confidence" flag to prevent reporting invalid contacts

The HID descriptor of many of Wacom's touch input devices include a
"Confidence" usage that signals if a particular touch collection contains
useful data. The driver does not look at this flag, however, which causes
even invalid contacts to be reported to userspace. A lucky combination of
kernel event filtering and device behavior (specifically: contact ID 0 ==
invalid, contact ID >0 == valid; and order all data so that all valid
contacts are reported before any invalid contacts) spare most devices from
any visibly-bad behavior.

The DTH-2452 is one example of an unlucky device that misbehaves. It uses
ID 0 for both the first valid contact and all invalid contacts. Because
we report both the valid and invalid contacts, the kernel reports that
contact 0 first goes down (valid) and then goes up (invalid) in every
report. This causes ~100 clicks per second simply by touching the screen.

This patch inroduces new `confidence` flag in our `hid_data` structure.
The value is initially set to `true` at the start of a report and can be
set to `false` if an invalid touch usage is seen.
