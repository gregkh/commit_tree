HID: magicmouse: prevent division by 0 on scroll

In hid_magicmouse, if the user has set scroll_speed to a value between
55 and 63 and scrolls seven times in quick succession, the
step_hr variable in the magicmouse_emit_touch function becomes 0.

That causes a division by zero further down in the function when
it does `step_x_hr /= step_hr`.

To reproduce, create `/etc/modprobe.d/hid_magicmouse.conf` with the
following content:

```
options hid_magicmouse scroll_acceleration=1 scroll_speed=55
```

Then reboot, connect a Magic Mouse and scroll seven times quickly.
The system will freeze for a minute, and after that `dmesg` will
confirm that a division by zero occurred.

Enforce a minimum of 1 for the variable so the high resolution
step count can never reach 0 even at maximum scroll acceleration.
