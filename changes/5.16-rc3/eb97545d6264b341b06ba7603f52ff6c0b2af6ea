scsi: core: sysfs: Fix setting device state to SDEV_RUNNING

This fixes an issue added in commit 4edd8cd4e86d ("scsi: core: sysfs: Fix
hang when device state is set via sysfs") where if userspace is requesting
to set the device state to SDEV_RUNNING when the state is already
SDEV_RUNNING, we return -EINVAL instead of count. The commmit above set ret
to count for this case, when it should have set it to 0.
