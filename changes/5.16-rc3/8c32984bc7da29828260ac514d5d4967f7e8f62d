ASoC: mediatek: mt8173: Fix debugfs registration for components

When registering the mt8173-afe-pcm driver, we are also adding two
components: one is for the PCM DAIs and one is for the HDMI DAIs, but
when debugfs is enabled, we're getting the following issue:

[   17.279176] debugfs: Directory '11220000.audio-controller' with parent 'mtk-rt5650' already present!
[   17.288345] debugfs: Directory '11220000.audio-controller' with parent 'mtk-rt5650' already present!

To overcome to that without any potentially big rewrite of this driver,
similarly to what was done in mt8195-afe-pcm, add a debugfs_prefix to
the components before actually adding them.
