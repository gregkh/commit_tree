ASoC: codecs: wcd938x: fix volatile register range

Interrupt Clear registers WCD938X_INTR_CLEAR_0 -  WCD938X_INTR_CLEAR_2
are not marked as volatile. This has resulted in a missing interrupt bug
while performing runtime pm. regcache_sync() during runtime pm resume path
will write to Interrupt clear registers with previous values which basically
clears the pending interrupt and actual interrupt handler never sees this
interrupt.

This issue is more visible with headset plug-in plug-out case compared to
headset button.

Fix this by adding the Interrupt clear registers to volatile range
