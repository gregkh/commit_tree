USB: serial: pl2303: fix GC type detection

At least some PL2303GC have a bcdDevice of 0x105 instead of 0x100 as the
datasheet claims. Add it to the list of known release numbers for the
HXN (G) type.

Note the chip type could only be determined indirectly based on its
package being of QFP type, which appears to only be available for
PL2303GC.
