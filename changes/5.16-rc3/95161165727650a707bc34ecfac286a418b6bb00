firmware: arm_scmi: Fix null de-reference on error path

During channel setup a failure in the call of scmi_vio_feed_vq_rx() leads
to an attempt to access a dev pointer by dereferencing vioch->cinfo at
a time when vioch->cinfo has still to be initialized.

Fix it by providing the device reference directly to scmi_vio_feed_vq_rx.
