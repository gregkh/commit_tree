tracing: Check pid filtering when creating events

When pid filtering is activated in an instance, all of the events trace
files for that instance has the PID_FILTER flag set. This determines
whether or not pid filtering needs to be done on the event, otherwise the
event is executed as normal.

If pid filtering is enabled when an event is created (via a dynamic event
or modules), its flag is not updated to reflect the current state, and the
events are not filtered properly.
