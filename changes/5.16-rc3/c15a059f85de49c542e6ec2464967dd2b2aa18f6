staging: r8188eu: Use kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC in atomic context

Use the GFP_ATOMIC flag of kzalloc() with two memory allocation in
report_del_sta_event(). This function is called while holding spinlocks,
therefore it is not allowed to sleep. With the GFP_ATOMIC type flag, the
allocation is high priority and must not sleep.

This issue is detected by Smatch which emits the following warning:
"drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_mlme_ext.c:6848 report_del_sta_event()
warn: sleeping in atomic context".

After the change, the post-commit hook output the following message:
"CHECK: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pcmd_obj)...) over
kzalloc(sizeof(struct cmd_obj)...)".

According to the above "CHECK", use the preferred style in the first
kzalloc().
