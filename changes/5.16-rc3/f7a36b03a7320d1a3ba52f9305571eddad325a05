vsock/virtio: suppress used length validation

It turns out that vhost vsock violates the virtio spec
by supplying the out buffer length in the used length
(should just be the in length).
As a result, attempts to validate the used length fail with:
vmw_vsock_virtio_transport virtio1: tx: used len 44 is larger than in buflen 0

Since vsock driver does not use the length fox tx and
validates the length before use for rx, it is safe to
suppress the validation in virtio core for this driver.
