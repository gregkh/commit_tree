usb: typec: fusb302: Fix masking of comparator and bc_lvl interrupts

The code that enables either BC_LVL or COMP_CHNG interrupt in tcpm_set_cc
wrongly assumes that the interrupt is unmasked by writing 1 to the apropriate
bit in the mask register. In fact, interrupts are enabled when the mask
is 0, so the tcpm_set_cc enables interrupt for COMP_CHNG when it expects
BC_LVL interrupt to be enabled.

This causes inability of the driver to recognize cable unplug events
in host mode (unplug is recognized only via a COMP_CHNG interrupt).

In device mode this bug was masked by simultaneous triggering of the VBUS
change interrupt, because of loss of VBUS when the port peer is providing
power.
