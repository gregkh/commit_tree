usb: chipidea: ci_hdrc_imx: fix potential error pointer dereference in probe

If the first call to devm_usb_get_phy_by_phandle(dev, "fsl,usbphy", 0)
fails with something other than -ENODEV then it leads to an error
pointer dereference.  For those errors we should just jump directly to
the error handling.
