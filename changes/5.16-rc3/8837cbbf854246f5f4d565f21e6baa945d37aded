net: ipv6: add fib6_nh_release_dsts stub

We need a way to release a fib6_nh's per-cpu dsts when replacing
nexthops otherwise we can end up with stale per-cpu dsts which hold net
device references, so add a new IPv6 stub called fib6_nh_release_dsts.
It must be used after an RCU grace period, so no new dsts can be created
through a group's nexthop entry.
Similar to fib6_nh_release it shouldn't be used if fib6_nh_init has failed
so it doesn't need a dummy stub when IPv6 is not enabled.
