net: hns3: fix incorrect components info of ethtool --reset command

Currently, HNS3 driver doesn't clear the reset flags of components after
successfully executing reset, it causes userspace info of
"Components reset" and "Components not reset" is incorrect.

So fix this problem by clear corresponding reset flag after reset process.
