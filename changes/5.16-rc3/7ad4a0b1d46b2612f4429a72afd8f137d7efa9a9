usb: dwc2: gadget: Fix ISOC flow for elapsed frames

Added updating of request frame number for elapsed frames,
otherwise frame number will remain as previous use of request.
This will allow function driver to correctly track frames in
case of Missed ISOC occurs.

Added setting request actual length to 0 for elapsed frames.
In Slave mode when pushing data to RxFIFO by dwords, request
actual length incrementing accordingly. But before whole packet
will be pushed into RxFIFO and send to host can occurs Missed
ISOC and data will not send to host. So, in this case request
actual length should be reset to 0.
