HID: multitouch: Fix Iiyama ProLite T1931SAW (0eef:0001 again!)

Iiyama ProLite T1931SAW does not work with Linux - input devices are
created but cursor does not move.

It has the infamous 0eef:0001 ID which has been reused for various
devices before.

It seems to require export_all_inputs = true.

Hopefully there are no HID devices using this ID that will break.
It should not break non-HID devices (handled by usbtouchscreen).
