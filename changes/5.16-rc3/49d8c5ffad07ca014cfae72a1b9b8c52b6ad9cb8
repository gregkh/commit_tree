vhost/vsock: fix incorrect used length reported to the guest

The "used length" reported by calling vhost_add_used() must be the
number of bytes written by the device (using "in" buffers).

In vhost_vsock_handle_tx_kick() the device only reads the guest
buffers (they are all "out" buffers), without writing anything,
so we must pass 0 as "used length" to comply virtio spec.
