mlxsw: spectrum: Allow driver to load with old firmware versions

The driver fails to load with old firmware versions that cannot report
the maximum number of RIF MAC profiles [1].

Fix this by defaulting to a maximum of a single profile in such
situations, as multiple profiles are not supported by old firmware
versions.

mlxsw_spectrum 0000:03:00.0: cannot register bus device
mlxsw_spectrum: probe of 0000:03:00.0 failed with error -5
