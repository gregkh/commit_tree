mm: Add functions to zero portions of a folio

These functions are wrappers around zero_user_segments(), which means
that zero_user_segments() can now be called for compound pages even when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is disabled.

Use 'xend' as the name of the parameter to indicate that this is an
excluded end, not the more usual included end.  Excluding the end makes
more sense to the callers, but can cause confusion to readers who are
more used to seeing included ends.
