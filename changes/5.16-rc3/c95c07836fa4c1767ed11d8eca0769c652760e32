netfilter: ipvs: Fix reuse connection if RS weight is 0

We are changing expire_nodest_conn to work even for reused connections when
conn_reuse_mode=0, just as what was done with commit dc7b3eb900aa ("ipvs:
Fix reuse connection if real server is dead").

For controlled and persistent connections, the new connection will get the
needed real server depending on the rules in ip_vs_check_template().

Fixes: d752c3645717 ("ipvs: allow rescheduling of new connections when port reuse is detected")
