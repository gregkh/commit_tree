binder: fix test regression due to sender_euid change

This is a partial revert of commit
29bc22ac5e5b ("binder: use euid from cred instead of using task").
Setting sender_euid using proc->cred caused some Android system test
regressions that need further investigation. It is a partial
reversion because subsequent patches rely on proc->cred.
