net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface

The Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to
stop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a
kernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions:
* reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L)
* reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G)
* installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp)

Prevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping
an interface.

Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing
any of the actions above:

Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff80001238d040
