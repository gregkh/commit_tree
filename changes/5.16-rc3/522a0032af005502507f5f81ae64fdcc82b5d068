Add linux/cacheflush.h

Many architectures do not include asm-generic/cacheflush.h, so turn
the includes on their head and add linux/cacheflush.h which includes
asm/cacheflush.h.

Move the flush_dcache_folio() declaration from asm-generic/cacheflush.h
to linux/cacheflush.h and change linux/highmem.h to include
linux/cacheflush.h instead of asm/cacheflush.h so that all necessary
places will see flush_dcache_folio().

More functions should have their default implementations moved in the
future, but those are for follow-on patches.  This fixes csky, sparc and
sparc64 which were missed in the commit which added flush_dcache_folio().
