NFSv42: Don't fail clone() unless the OP_CLONE operation failed

The failure to retrieve post-op attributes has no bearing on whether or
not the clone operation itself was successful. We must therefore ignore
the return value of decode_getfattr() when looking at the success or
failure of nfs4_xdr_dec_clone().
