mmc: spi: Add device-tree SPI IDs

Commit 5fa6863ba692 ("spi: Check we have a spi_device_id for each DT
compatible") added a test to check that every SPI driver has a
spi_device_id for each DT compatiable string defined by the driver
and warns if the spi_device_id is missing. The spi_device_id is
missing for the MMC SPI driver and the following warning is now seen.

 WARNING KERN SPI driver mmc_spi has no spi_device_id for mmc-spi-slot

Fix this by adding the necessary spi_device_id.
