cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add Ice Lake server to out-of-band IDs

Commit fbdc21e9b038 ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add Icelake servers
support in no-HWP mode") enabled the use of Intel P-State driver
for Ice Lake servers.

But it doesn't cover the case when OS can't control P-States.

Therefore, for Ice Lake server, if MSR_MISC_PWR_MGMT bits 8 or 18
are enabled, then the Intel P-State driver should exit as OS can't
control P-States.
