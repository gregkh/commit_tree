ASoC: mediatek: mt8173-rt5650: Rename Speaker control to Ext Spk

Some RT5645 and RT5650 powered platforms are using "Ext Spk"
instead of "Speaker", and this is also reflected in alsa-lib
configurations for the generic RT5645 usecase manager configs.

Rename the "Speaker" control to "Ext Spk" in order to be able
to make the userspace reuse/inherit the same configurations also
for this machine, along with the others.
