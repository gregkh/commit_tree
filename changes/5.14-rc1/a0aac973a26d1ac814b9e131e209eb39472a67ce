nvme-pci: fix var. type for increasing cq_head

nvmeq->cq_head is compared with nvmeq->q_depth and changed the value
and cq_phase for handling the next cq db.

but, nvmeq->q_depth's type is u32 and max. value is 0x10000 when
CQP.MSQE is 0xffff and io_queue_depth is 0x10000.

current temp. variable for comparing with nvmeq->q_depth is overflowed
when previous nvmeq->cq_head is 0xffff.

in this case, nvmeq->cq_phase is not updated.
so, fix data type for temp. variable to u32.
