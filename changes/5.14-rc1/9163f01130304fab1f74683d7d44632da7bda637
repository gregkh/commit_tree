arm64/mm: Fix ttbr0 values stored in struct thread_info for software-pan

When using CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN, a task's thread_info::ttbr0 must be
the TTBR0_EL1 value used to run userspace. With 52-bit PAs, the PA must be
packed into the TTBR using phys_to_ttbr(), but we forget to do this in some
of the SW PAN code. Thus, if the value is installed into TTBR0_EL1 (as may
happen in the uaccess routines), this could result in UNPREDICTABLE
behaviour.

Since hardware with 52-bit PA support almost certainly has HW PAN, which
will be used in preference, this shouldn't be a practical issue, but let's
fix this for consistency.
