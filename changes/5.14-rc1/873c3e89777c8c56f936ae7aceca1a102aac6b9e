arm64: Kill 32-bit applications scheduled on 64-bit-only CPUs

Scheduling a 32-bit application on a 64-bit-only CPU is a bad idea.

Ensure that 32-bit applications always take the slow-path when returning
to userspace on a system with mismatched support at EL0, so that we can
avoid trying to run on a 64-bit-only CPU and force a SIGKILL instead.
