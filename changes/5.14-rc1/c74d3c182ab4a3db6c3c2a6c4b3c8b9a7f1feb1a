s390/speculation: Use statically initialized const for instructions

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
confusing the checks when using a static const source.

Move the static const array into a variable so the compiler can perform
appropriate bounds checking.
