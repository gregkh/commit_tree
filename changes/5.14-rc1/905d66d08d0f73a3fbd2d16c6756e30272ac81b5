drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: More renames in prep for sub-devices

Like the previous patch ("drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Rename the main
driver data structure") this is just a no-op rename in preparation for
splitting the driver up a bit.

Here I've attempted to rename functions / structures making sure that
anything applicable to the whole chip (instead of just the MIPI to eDP
bridge part) included "sn65dsi86" somewhere in the name instead of
just "ti_sn_bridge".
