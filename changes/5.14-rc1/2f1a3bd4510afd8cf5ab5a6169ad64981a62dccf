pwm: tegra: Assert reset only after the PWM was unregistered

The driver is supposed to stay functional until pwmchip_remove()
returns. So the reset must be asserted only after that.

pwmchip_remove() always returns 0, so the return code can be ignored
which keeps the tegra_pwm_remove() a bit simpler.
