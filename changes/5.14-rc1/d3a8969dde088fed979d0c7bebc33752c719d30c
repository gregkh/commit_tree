iio: accel: bmc150-accel: Balanced runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

A call to pm_runtime_put_noidle() doesn't match any call that would
result in a get().  It is safe because runtime pm core protects against
the reference counter going 0, but it makes it harder to understand the
code.

Whilst here use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to tidy things up.
The Coccinelle script didn't get this one due to more complex code
structure.
