crypto: octeontx2 - Add mailbox support for CN10K

Mailbox region configuration has some changes on CN10K platform
from OcteonTX2(CN9XX) platform.

On CN10K platform:
The DRAM region allocated to PF is enumerated as PF BAR4 memory.
PF BAR4 contains AF-PF mbox region followed by its VFs mbox region.
AF-PF mbox region base address is configured at RVU_AF_PFX_BAR4_ADDR
PF-VF mailbox base address is configured at
RVU_PF(x)_VF_MBOX_ADDR = RVU_AF_PF()_BAR4_ADDR+64KB. PF access its
mbox region via BAR4, whereas VF accesses PF-VF DRAM mailboxes via
BAR2 indirect access.

On CN9XX platform:
Mailbox region in DRAM is divided into two parts AF-PF mbox region and
PF-VF mbox region i.e all PFs mbox region is contiguous similarly all
VFs.
The base address of the AF-PF mbox region is configured at
RVU_AF_PF_BAR4_ADDR.
AF-PF1 mbox address can be calculated as RVU_AF_PF_BAR4_ADDR * mbox
size.

This patch changes mbox initialization to support both CN9XX and CN10K
platform.
This patch also removes platform specific name from the PF/VF driver name
to make it appropriate for all supported platforms.
