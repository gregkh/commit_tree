RDMA/irdma: Store PBL info address a pointer type

The level1 PBL info address is stored as u64.  This requires casting
through a uinptr_t before used as a pointer type.

And this leads to sparse warning such as this when uinptr_t is missing:

drivers/infiniband/hw/irdma/hw.c: In function 'irdma_destroy_virt_aeq':
drivers/infiniband/hw/irdma/hw.c:579:23: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
  579 |  dma_addr_t *pg_arr = (dma_addr_t *)aeq->palloc.level1.addr;

This can be fixed using an intermediate uintptr_t, but rather it is better
to fix the structure irdm_pble_info to store the address as u64* and the
VA it is assigned in irdma_chunk as a void*. This greatly reduces the
casting on this address.
