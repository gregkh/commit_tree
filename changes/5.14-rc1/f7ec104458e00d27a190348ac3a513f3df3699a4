mm/page_alloc: fix counting of managed_pages

commit f63661566fad ("mm/page_alloc.c: clear out zone->lowmem_reserve[] if
the zone is empty") clears out zone->lowmem_reserve[] if zone is empty.
But when zone is not empty and sysctl_lowmem_reserve_ratio[i] is set to
zero, zone_managed_pages(zone) is not counted in the managed_pages either.
This is inconsistent with the description of lowmem_reserve, so fix it.
