ALSA: rawmidi: fix incorrect array bounds check on clock_names

The array bounds check on clock_names is currently checking the size
of the entire array rather than the number of elements in the array
leading to a potential array bounds read error. Fix this by using
the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead of sizeof.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Out-of-bounds read")
