locking/lockdep: Fix the dep path printing for backwards BFS

We use the same code to print backwards lock dependency path as the
forwards lock dependency path, and this could result into incorrect
printing because for a backwards lock_list ->trace is not the call trace
where the lock of ->class is acquired.

Fix this by introducing a separate function on printing the backwards
dependency path. Also add a few comments about the printing while we are
at it.
