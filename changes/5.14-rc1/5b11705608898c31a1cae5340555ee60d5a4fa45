drm/i915/selftests: Rename pm_ prefixed functions names

pm_resume and pm_suspend might be conflict with the ones defined in
include/linux/suspend.h. Rename all pm_* to igt_pm_* in selftests since
they are only used here.

v2 by Jani:
- Use igt_ prefix instead of i915_ to avoid colliding with existing
  i915_pm_* functions
- Rename all pm_ prefixed functions in the file
