scsi: lpfc: Fix node handling for Fabric Controller and Domain Controller

During link bounce testing, RPI counts were seen to differ from the number
of nodes. For fabric and domain controllers, a temporary RPI is assigned,
but the code isn't registering it. If the nodes do go away, such as on link
down, the temporary RPI isn't being released.

Change the way these two fabric services are managed, make them behave like
any other remote port. Register the RPI and register with the transport.
Never leave the nodes in a NPR or UNUSED state where their RPI is in limbo.
This allows them to follow normal dev_loss_tmo handling, RPI refcounting,
and normal removal rules. It also allows fabric I/Os to use the RPI for
traffic requests.

Note: There is some logic that still has a couple of exceptions when the
Domain controller (0xfffcXX). There are cases where the fabric won't have a
valid login but will send RDP. Other times, it will it send a LOGO then an
RDP. It makes for ad-hoc behavior to manage the node. Exceptions are
documented in the code.
