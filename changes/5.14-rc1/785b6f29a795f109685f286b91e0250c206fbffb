ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Fix wrong resume call

The current way of the scarlett2 mixer code managing the
usb_mixer_elem_info object is wrong in two ways: it passes its
internal index to the head.id field, and the val_type field is
uninitialized.  This ended up with the wrong execution at the resume
because a bogus unit id is passed wrongly.  Also, in the later code
extensions, we'll have more mixer elements, and passing the index will
overflow the unit id size (of 256).

This patch corrects those issues.  It introduces a new value type,
USB_MIXER_BESPOKEN, which indicates a non-standard mixer element, and
use this type for all scarlett2 mixer elements, as well as
initializing the fixed unit id 0 for avoiding the overflow.
