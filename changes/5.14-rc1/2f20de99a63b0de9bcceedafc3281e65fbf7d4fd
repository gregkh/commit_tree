rcu: Make rcu_gp_cleanup() be noinline for tracing

Although there are trace events for RCU grace periods, these are only
enabled in CONFIG_RCU_TRACE=y kernels.  This commit therefore marks
rcu_gp_cleanup() noinline in order to provide a function that can be
traced that is invoked near the end of each grace period.
