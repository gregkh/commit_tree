ACPI: processor_perflib: Cleanup print messages

The log messages in processor_perflib.c is not in consistency,
we have some printk() calls with PREFIX, but some are not; we
use pr_*() functions without prefix. So add pr_fmt() and unify
them with pr_*() functions.

While at it, fix some obvious coding style issues when going
through the functions.
