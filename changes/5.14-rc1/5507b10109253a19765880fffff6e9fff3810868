media: atmel: atmel-isc: extend pipeline with extra modules

Newer ISC pipelines have the additional modules of
Defective Pixel Correction -> DPC itself,
Defective Pixel Correction -> Green Disparity Correction (DPC_GDC)
Defective Pixel Correction -> Black Level Correction (DPC_BLC)
Vertical and Horizontal Scaler -> VHXS

Some products have this full pipeline (sama7g5), other products do not (sama5d2)

Add the modules to the isc base, and also extend the register range to include
the modules.
