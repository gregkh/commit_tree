staging: mt7621-pci: make cleaner 'mt7621_pcie_enable_ports'

Function 'mt7621_pcie_enable_ports' call 'mt7621_pcie_enable_port'
for each available pcie port. Instead of having two for loops
there just move needed initialization. There is one setting
that can be removed which is the set for 'PCI_COMMAND_MASTER'
bit. Pci drivers are in charge of set that bit if is really
needed and should be not a mission of the controller to do that.
