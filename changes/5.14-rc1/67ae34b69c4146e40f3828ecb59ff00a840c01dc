btrfs: add device delete cancel

Accept device name "cancel" as a request to cancel running device
deletion operation. The string is literal, in case there's a real device
named "cancel", pass it as full absolute path or as "./cancel"

This works for v1 and v2 ioctls when the device is specified by name.
Moving chunks from the device uses relocation, use the conditional
exclusive operation start and cancellation helpers
