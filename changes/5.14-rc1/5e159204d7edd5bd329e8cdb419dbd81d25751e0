io_uring: small io_submit_sqe() optimisation

submit_state.link is used only to assemble a link and not used for
actual submission, so clear it before io_queue_sqe() in io_submit_sqe(),
awhile it's hot and in caches and queueing doesn't spoil it. May also
potentially help compiler with spilling or to do other optimisations.
