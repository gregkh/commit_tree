media: mdk-mdp: fix pm_runtime_get_sync() usage count

The pm_runtime_get_sync() internally increments the
dev->power.usage_count without decrementing it, even on errors.
Replace it by the new pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), introduced by:
commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
in order to properly decrement the usage counter, avoiding
a potential PM usage counter leak.

While here, fix the return contition of mtk_mdp_m2m_start_streaming(),
as it doesn't make any sense to return 0 if the PM runtime failed
to resume.
