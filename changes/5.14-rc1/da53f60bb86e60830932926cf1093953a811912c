x86/fpu: Clean up fpregs_set()

fpregs_set() has unnecessary complexity to support short or nonzero-offset
writes and to handle the case in which a copy from userspace overwrites
some of the target buffer and then fails.  Support for partial writes is
useless -- just require that the write has offset 0 and the correct size,
and copy into a temporary kernel buffer to avoid clobbering the state if
the user access fails.
