mm: drop SECTION_SHIFT in code comments

Actually SECTIONS_SHIFT is used in the kernel code, so the code comments
is strictly incorrect.  And since commit bbeae5b05ef6 ("mm: move page
flags layout to separate header"), SECTIONS_SHIFT definition has been
moved to include/linux/page-flags-layout.h, since code itself looks quite
straighforward, instead of moving the code comment into the new place as
well, we just simply remove it.

This also fixed a checkpatch complain derived from the original code:
WARNING: please, no space before tabs
+ * SECTIONS_SHIFT    ^I^I#bits space required to store a section #$
