iio: accel: kxcjk-1013: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

This driver alls pm_runtime_put_noidle() in it's remove function, but there
is no matching get call.  This isn't a bug as runtime pm will not allow
the reference counter to go negative, but it is missleading so lets remove
it.

Whilst here use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to tidy up some boilerplate.
The coccicheck script didn't get this one due to the less obvious
structure. Found by inspection.
