userfaultfd/selftests: remove the time() check on delayed uffd

There seems to have no guarantee that time() will return the same for the
two calls even if there's no delay, e.g.  when a fault is accidentally
crossing the changing of a second.  Meanwhile, this message is also not
helping that much since delay could happen with a lot of reasons, e.g.,
schedule latency of resolving thread.  It may not mean an issue with uffd.

Neither do I saw this error triggered either in the past runs.  Even if it
triggers, it'll be drown in all the rest of test logs.  Remove it.
