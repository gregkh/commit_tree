ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Fixup SPI binding

1. Reorder interrupts
2. Fix typo: s/spi_lr_overhead/spi_lr_overread/
3. Rename node: s/spi-nor@0/flash@0/

This fixes:
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm4709-buffalo-wxr-1900dhp.dt.yaml: spi@18029200: interrupt-names: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
        ['spi_lr_fullness_reached', 'spi_lr_session_aborted', 'spi_lr_impatient', 'spi_lr_session_done', 'spi_lr_overhead', 'mspi_done', 'mspi_halted'] is too long
        Additional items are not allowed ('spi_lr_session_aborted', 'spi_lr_impatient', 'spi_lr_session_done', 'spi_lr_overhead', 'mspi_done', 'mspi_halted' were unexpected)
        'mspi_done' was expected
        'spi_l1_intr' was expected
        'mspi_halted' was expected
        'spi_lr_fullness_reached' was expected
        'spi_lr_session_aborted' was expected
        'spi_lr_impatient' was expected
        'spi_lr_session_done' was expected
        'spi_lr_overread' was expected
