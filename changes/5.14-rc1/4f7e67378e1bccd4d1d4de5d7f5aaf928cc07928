btrfs: fix misleading and incomplete comment of btrfs_truncate()

The comment at the top of btrfs_truncate() mentions that csum items are
dropped or truncated to the new i_size, but this is wrong and non sense,
as they are unrelated to the i_size and are located in the csums tree and
not on a tree with inode items (fs/subvolume tree or a log tree). Instead
that claim applies to file extent items, so fix the comment to refer to
them instead.

While at it make the whole comment for the function more descriptive and
follow the kernel doc style.
