net: qualcomm: rmnet: always expose a few functions

A recent change tidied up some conditional code, avoiding the use of
some #ifdefs.  Unfortunately, if CONFIG_IPV6 was not enabled, it
meant that two functions were referenced but never defined.

The easiest fix is to just define stubs for these functions if
CONFIG_IPV6 is not defined.  This will soon be simplified further
by some other development in the works...
