ocfs2: fix snprintf() checking

The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes which would have been
printed if the buffer was large enough.  In other words it can return ">=
remain" but this code assumes it returns "== remain".

The run time impact of this bug is not very severe.  The next iteration
through the loop would trigger a WARN() when we pass a negative limit to
snprintf().  We would then return success instead of -E2BIG.

The kernel implementation of snprintf() will never return negatives so
there is no need to check and I have deleted that dead code.
