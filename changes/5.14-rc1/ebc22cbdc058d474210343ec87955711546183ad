drm/amd/display: minor dp link training refactor

[how]
The change includes some dp link training refactors:
1. break down is_ch_eq_done to checking individual conditions in
its own function.
2. update dpcd_set_training_pattern to take in dc_dp_training_pattern
as input.
3. moving lttpr mode struct definition into link_service_types.h
