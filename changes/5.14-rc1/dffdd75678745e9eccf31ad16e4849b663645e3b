iio: gyro: st_gyro: Move platform data from header to C file

Platform data is solely used by one file. Don't share it with others.

While at it, drop unneeded anymore __maybe_unused and fix kernel doc
to avoid warning:

  st_gyro_core.c:366: error: Cannot parse struct or union!

by converting to a simple comment. It is described at the declaration.
