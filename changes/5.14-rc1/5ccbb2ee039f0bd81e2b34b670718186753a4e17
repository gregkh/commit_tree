drm/bridge: DRM_CROS_EC_ANX7688 should depend on I2C_CROS_EC_TUNNEL

The ChromeOS EC ANX7688 bridge is connected to a ChromeOS Embedded
Controller, and is accessed using I2C tunneling through the Embedded
Controller.  Hence add a dependency on I2C_CROS_EC_TUNNEL, to prevent
asking the user about this driver when configuring a kernel without
support for the ChromeOS EC tunnel I2C bus.
