docs: ABI: sysfs-class-led-trigger-pattern: remove repeat duplication

As reported by scripts/get_abi.pl:

	Warning: /sys/class/leds/<led>/repeat is defined 2 times:  Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-driver-el15203000:0  Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-pattern:28

The definition for the EL15203000 is just a special case of
the sysfs led class. So, drop it and mentions the possible
exception at the class definition.
