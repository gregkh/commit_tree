net: hns3: refactor dump tm of debugfs

Currently, user gets some tm info by implementing debugfs command
"echo dump tm > cmd", this command will dump info in dmesg. It's
unnecessary and heavy.

In addition, the info of this command mixes info of qset, priority,
pg and port. Qset and priority have their own command to get info of
themself, so can remove info of qset and priority from this command.

To optimize it, create two new files "tm_pg", "tm_port" in tm directory
and use cat command to separately get info of pg and port.

The display style is below:
$ cat tm_pg
ID  PRI_MAP  MODE DWRR  C_IR_B  C_IR_U  C_IR_S  C_BS_B  C_BS_S ...
00   0x1f    dwrr  1       75       9       0      31      20  ...

$ cat tm_port
IR_B  IR_U  IR_S  BS_B  BS_S  FLAG  RATE(Mbps)
75     9     0    31    20    1     200000
