mm: add a signature in struct page

This is needed by the page_pool to avoid recycling a page not allocated
via page_pool.

The page->signature field is aliased to page->lru.next and
page->compound_head, but it can't be set by mistake because the
signature value is a bad pointer, and can't trigger a false positive
in PageTail() because the last bit is 0.
