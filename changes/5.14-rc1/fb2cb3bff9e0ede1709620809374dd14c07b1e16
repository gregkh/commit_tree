pwm: vt8500: Drop if with an always false condition

vt8500_pwm_remove() is only called after vt8500_pwm_probe() returned
successfully. In this case driver data was set to a non-NULL value
and so chip can never be NULL.

While touching this code also put declaration and assignment in a single
line.
