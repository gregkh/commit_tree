ice: add support for sideband messages

In order to support certain device features, including enabling the PTP
hardware clock, the ice driver needs to control some registers on the
device PHY.

These registers are accessed by sending sideband messages. For some
hardware, these messages must be sent over the device admin queue, while
other hardware has a dedicated control queue for the sideband messages.

Add the neighbor device message structure for sending a message to the
neighboring device. Where supported, initialize the sideband control
queue and handle cleanup.

Add a wrapper function for sending sideband control queue messages that
read or write a neighboring device register.

Because some devices send sideband messages over the AdminQ, also
increase the length of the admin queue to allow more messages to be
queued up. This is important because the sideband messages add
additional pressure on the AQ usage.

This support will be used in following patches to enable support for
CONFIG_1588_PTP_CLOCK.
