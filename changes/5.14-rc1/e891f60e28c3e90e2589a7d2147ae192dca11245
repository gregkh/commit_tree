mm/z3fold: remove magic number in z3fold_create_pool()

It's meaningless to pass a magic number 2 to __alloc_percpu() as there is
a minimum alignment size of PCPU_MIN_ALLOC_SIZE (> 2) in it.  Also there
is no special alignment requirement for unbuddied.  So we could replace
this magic number with nature alignment, i.e.  __alignof__(struct
list_head), to improve readability.
