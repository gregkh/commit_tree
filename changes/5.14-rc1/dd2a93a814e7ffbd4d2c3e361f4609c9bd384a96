cxl/mem: Demarcate vendor specific capability IDs

Vendor capabilities occupy 0x8000 to 0xFFFF according to CXL 2.0 spec
8.2.8.2.1 CXL Device Capabilities. While they are not defined by the
spec, they are allowed and not "unknown". Call this detail out in the
logs to let users easily distinguish the difference.

This patch is a squash of two earlier patches and take in some minor
suggestions from both Vishal and Dan.
