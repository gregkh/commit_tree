arm64: Import updated version of Cortex Strings' strlen

Import an updated version of the former Cortex Strings - now Arm
Optimized Routines - strcmp function. The latest version introduces
Advanced SIMD usage which rules it out for our purposes, but we can
still pick an intermediate improvement from the previous version,
namely string/aarch64/strlen.S at commit 98e4d6a from
https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines

Note that for simplicity Arm have chosen to contribute this code
to Linux under GPLv2 rather than the original MIT license.
