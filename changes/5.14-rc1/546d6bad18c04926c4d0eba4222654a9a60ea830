net: phy: fix yt8511 clang uninitialized variable warning

clang doesn't preinitialize variables. If phy_select_page failed and
returned an error, phy_restore_page would be called with `ret` being
uninitialized.
Even though phy_restore_page won't use `ret` in this scenario,
initialize `ret` to silence the warning.
