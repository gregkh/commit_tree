writeback, cgroup: add smp_mb() to cgroup_writeback_umount()

A full memory barrier is required between clearing SB_ACTIVE flag in
generic_shutdown_super() and checking isw_nr_in_flight in
cgroup_writeback_umount(), otherwise a new switch operation might be
scheduled after atomic_read(&isw_nr_in_flight) returned 0.  This would
result in a non-flushed isw_wq, and a potential crash.

The problem hasn't yet been seen in the real life and was discovered by
Jan Kara by looking into the code.
