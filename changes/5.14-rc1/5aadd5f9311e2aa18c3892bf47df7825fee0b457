nvme-tcp-offload: Add controller level implementation

In this patch we implement controller level functionality including:
- create_ctrl.
- delete_ctrl.
- free_ctrl.

The implementation is similar to other nvme fabrics modules, the main
difference being that the nvme-tcp-offload ULP calls the vendor specific
claim_dev() op with the given TCP/IP parameters to determine which device
will be used for this controller.
Once found, the vendor specific device and controller will be paired and
kept in a controller list managed by the ULP.
