KVM: arm64: Remove the creation time's mapping of MMIO regions

The MMIO regions may be unmapped for many reasons and can be remapped
by stage2 fault path. Map MMIO regions at creation time becomes a
minor optimization and makes these two mapping path hard to sync.

Remove the mapping code while keep the useful sanity check.
