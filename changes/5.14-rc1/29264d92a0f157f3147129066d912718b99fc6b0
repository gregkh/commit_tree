writeback, cgroup: switch to rcu_work API in inode_switch_wbs()

Inode's wb switching requires two steps divided by an RCU grace period.
It's currently implemented as an RCU callback inode_switch_wbs_rcu_fn(),
which schedules inode_switch_wbs_work_fn() as a work.

Switching to the rcu_work API allows to do the same in a cleaner and
slightly shorter form.
