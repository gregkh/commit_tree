KVM: x86/mmu: Use MMU's roles to compute last non-leaf level

Use the MMU's role to get CR4.PSE when determining the last level at
which the guest _cannot_ create a non-leaf PTE, i.e. cannot create a
huge page.

Note, the existing logic is arguably wrong when considering 5-level
paging and the case where 1gb pages aren't supported.  In practice, the
logic is confusing but not broken, because except for 32-bit non-PAE
paging, bit 7 (_PAGE_PSE) bit is reserved when a huge page isn't supported at
that level.  I.e. setting bit 7 will terminate the guest walk one way or
another.  Furthermore, last_nonleaf_level is only consulted after KVM has
verified there are no reserved bits set.

All that confusion will be addressed in a future patch by dropping
last_nonleaf_level entirely.  For now, massage the code to continue the
march toward using mmu_role for (almost) all MMU computations.
