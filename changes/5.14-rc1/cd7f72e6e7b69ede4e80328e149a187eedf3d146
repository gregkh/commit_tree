drm/bridge/synopsys: dw-hdmi: Add an option to suppress loading CEC driver

This adds DW-HDMI driver a glue option to disable loading of the CEC sub-driver.

On some SoCs, the CEC functionality is enabled in the IP config bits, but the
CEC bus is non-functional like on Amlogic SoCs, where the CEC config bit is set
but the DW-HDMI CEC signal is not connected to a physical pin, leading to some
confusion when the DW-HDMI CEC controller can't communicate on the bus.
