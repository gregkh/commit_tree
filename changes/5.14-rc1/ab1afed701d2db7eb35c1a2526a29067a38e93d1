intel_th: Wait until port is in reset before programming it

Some devices don't drain their pipelines if we don't make sure that
the corresponding output port is in reset before programming it for
a new trace capture, resulting in bits of old trace appearing in the
new trace capture. Fix that by explicitly making sure the reset is
asserted before programming new trace capture.
