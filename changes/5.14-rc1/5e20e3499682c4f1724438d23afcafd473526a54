arm64: Downgrade flush_icache_range to invalidate

Since __flush_dcache_area is called right before,
invalidate_icache_range is sufficient in this case.

Rewrite the comment to better explain the rationale behind the
cache maintenance operations used here.

No functional change intended.
Possible performance impact due to invalidating only the icache
rather than invalidating and cleaning both caches.
