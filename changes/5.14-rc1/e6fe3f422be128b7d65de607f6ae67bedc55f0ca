sched: Make multiple runqueue task counters 32-bit

Make:

	struct dl_rq::dl_nr_migratory
	struct dl_rq::dl_nr_running

	struct rt_rq::rt_nr_boosted
	struct rt_rq::rt_nr_migratory
	struct rt_rq::rt_nr_total

	struct rq::nr_uninterruptible

32-bit.

If total number of tasks can't exceed 2**32 (and less due to futex pid
limits), then per-runqueue counters can't as well.

This patchset has been sponsored by REX Prefix Eradication Society.
