KVM: x86/mmu: Rename unsync helper and update related comments

Rename mmu_need_write_protect() to mmu_try_to_unsync_pages() and update
a variety of related, stale comments.  Add several new comments to call
out subtle details, e.g. that upper-level shadow pages are write-tracked,
and that can_unsync is false iff KVM is in the process of synchronizing
pages.

No functional change intended.
