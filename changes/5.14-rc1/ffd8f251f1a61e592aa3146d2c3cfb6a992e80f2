mm/page_alloc: move prototype for find_suitable_fallback

make W=1 generates the following warning in mmap_lock.c for allnoconfig

  mm/page_alloc.c:2670:5: warning: no previous prototype for `find_suitable_fallback' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
   int find_suitable_fallback(struct free_area *area, unsigned int order,
       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

find_suitable_fallback is only shared outside of page_alloc.c for
CONFIG_COMPACTION but to suppress the warning, move the protype outside of
CONFIG_COMPACTION.  It is not worth the effort at this time to find a
clever way of allowing compaction.c to share the code or avoid the use
entirely as the function is called on relatively slow paths.
