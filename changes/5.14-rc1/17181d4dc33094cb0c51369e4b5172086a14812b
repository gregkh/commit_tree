iio: adc: ads1015: Balance runtime pm + pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

The call to pm_runtime_put_noidle() in remove() is not balancing a
counter increment.  Note this doesn't matter as the runtime pm core
will not allow the counter to go negative.  However, it is confusing
to the reader so let's remove it.

The pm_runtime_resume_and_get() replacement was found using coccicheck
script under review at:

This is a prequel to taking a closer look at the runtime pm in IIO drivers
in general.
