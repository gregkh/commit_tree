powerpc: Don't use 'struct ppc_inst' to reference instruction location

'struct ppc_inst' is an internal representation of an instruction, but
in-memory instructions are and will remain a table of 'u32' forever.

Replace all 'struct ppc_inst *' used for locating an instruction in
memory by 'u32 *'. This removes a lot of undue casts to 'struct
ppc_inst *'.

It also helps locating ab-use of 'struct ppc_inst' dereference.
