cfg80211: Support hidden AP discovery over 6GHz band

To discover a hidden AP on the 6GHz band, the probe request
sent to the AP needs to include the AP's SSID, as some APs
would not respond with a probe response based only on short
SSID match.

To support hidden AP discovery over the 6GHz band,
when constructing the specific 6GHz band scan also include
SSIDs that were part of the original scan request, so these
can be used in the probe requests transmitted during scan.
