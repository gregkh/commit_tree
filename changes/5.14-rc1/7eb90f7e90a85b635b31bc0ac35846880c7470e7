ubd: remove the code to register as the legacy IDE driver

With the legacy IDE driver long deprecated, and modern userspace being
much more flexible about dev_t assignments there is no reason to fake
a registration as the legacy IDE driver in ubd.  This registeration
is a little problematic as it registers the same request_queue for
multiple gendisks, so just remove it.
