s390/ap: Rework ap_dqap to deal with messages greater than recv buffer

Rework of the ap_dqap() inline function with the dqap inline assembler
invocation and the caller code in ap_queue.c to be able to handle
replies which exceed the receive buffer size.

ap_dqap() now provides two additional parameters to handle together
with the caller the case where a reply in the firmware queue entry
exceeds the given message buffer size. It depends on the caller how to
exactly handle this. The behavior implemented now by ap_sm_recv() in
ap_queue.c is to simple purge this entry from the firmware queue and
let the caller 'receive' a -EMSGSIZE for the request without
delivering any reply data - not even a truncated reply message.

However, the reworked ap_dqap() could now get invoked in a way that
the message is received in multiple parts and the caller assembles the
parts into one reply message.
