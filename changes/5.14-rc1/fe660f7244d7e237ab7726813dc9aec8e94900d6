KVM: x86/mmu: Collapse 32-bit PAE and 64-bit statements for helpers

Skip paging32E_init_context() and paging64_init_context_common() and go
directly to paging64_init_context() (was the common version) now that
the relevant flows don't need to distinguish between 64-bit PAE and
32-bit PAE for other reasons.

No functional change intended.
