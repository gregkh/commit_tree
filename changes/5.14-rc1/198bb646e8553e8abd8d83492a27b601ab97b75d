media: i2c: rdacm20: Re-work ov10635 reset

The OV10635 image sensor embedded in the camera module is currently
reset after the MAX9271 initialization with two long delays that were
most probably not correctly characterized.

Re-work the image sensor reset procedure by holding the chip in reset
during the MAX9271 configuration, removing the long sleep delays and
only wait after the chip exits from reset for 350-500 microseconds
interval, which is larger than the minimum (2048 * (1 / XVCLK)) timeout
characterized in the chip manual.
