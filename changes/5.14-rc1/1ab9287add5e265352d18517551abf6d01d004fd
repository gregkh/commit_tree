KVM: X86: Add vendor callbacks for writing the TSC multiplier

Currently vmx_vcpu_load_vmcs() writes the TSC_MULTIPLIER field of the
VMCS every time the VMCS is loaded. Instead of doing this, set this
field from common code on initialization and whenever the scaling ratio
changes.

Additionally remove vmx->current_tsc_ratio. This field is redundant as
vcpu->arch.tsc_scaling_ratio already tracks the current TSC scaling
ratio. The vmx->current_tsc_ratio field is only used for avoiding
unnecessary writes but it is no longer needed after removing the code
from the VMCS load path.
