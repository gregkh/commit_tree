powerpc: Offline CPU in stop_this_cpu()

printk_safe_flush_on_panic() has special lock breaking code for the case
where we panic()ed with the console lock held. It relies on panic IPI
causing other CPUs to mark themselves offline.

Do as most other architectures do.

This effectively reverts commit de6e5d38417e ("powerpc: smp_send_stop do
not offline stopped CPUs"), unfortunately it may result in some false
positive warnings, but the alternative is more situations where we can
crash without getting messages out.

Fixes: de6e5d38417e ("powerpc: smp_send_stop do not offline stopped CPUs")
