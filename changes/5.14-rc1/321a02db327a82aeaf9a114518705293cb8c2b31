btrfs: only require sector size alignment for end_bio_extent_writepage()

Just like read page, for subpage support we only require sector size
alignment.

So change the error message condition to only require sector alignment.

This should not affect existing code, as for regular sectorsize ==
PAGE_SIZE case, we are still requiring page alignment.
