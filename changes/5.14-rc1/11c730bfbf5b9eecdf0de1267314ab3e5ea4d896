octeontx2-af: support for coalescing KPU profiles

Adding support to load a new type of KPU image, known as coalesced/
consolidated KPU image via firmware database. This image is a
consolidation of multiple KPU profiles into a single image.

During kernel bootup this coalesced image will be read via
firmware database and only the relevant KPU profile will be loaded.
Existing functionality of loading single KPU/MKEX profile
is intact as the images are differentiated based on the image signature.
