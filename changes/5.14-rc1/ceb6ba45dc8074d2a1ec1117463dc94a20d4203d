commit 9e077b52d86a ("sched/pelt: Check that *_avg are null when *_sum are")
reported some inconsitencies between *_avg and *_sum.

commit 1c35b07e6d39 ("sched/fair: Ensure _sum and _avg values stay consistent")
fixed some but one remains when dequeuing load.

sync the cfs's load_sum with its load_avg after dequeuing the load of a
sched_entity.
