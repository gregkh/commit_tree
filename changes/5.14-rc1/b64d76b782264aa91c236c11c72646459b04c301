net: wwan: make WWAN_PORT_MAX meaning less surprised

It is quite unusual when some value can not be equal to a defined range
max value. Also most subsystems defines FOO_TYPE_MAX as a maximum valid
value. So turn the WAN_PORT_MAX meaning from the number of supported
port types to the maximum valid port type.
