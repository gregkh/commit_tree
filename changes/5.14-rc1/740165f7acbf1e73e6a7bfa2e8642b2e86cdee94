mxser: introduce and use start/stop_tx helpers

Starting and stopping TX is performed on many places in the driver. It
is repeated outb and info->IER modification.  Create few helpers
(__mxser_start_tx, mxser_start_tx, __mxser_stop_tx) and use them in the
code instead of open coding.

This should be a base for an uart driver for this device in the future.
