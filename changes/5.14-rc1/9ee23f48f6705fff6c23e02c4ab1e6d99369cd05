wwan_hwsim: add debugfs management interface

wwan_hwsim creates and removes simulated control ports on module loading
and unloading. It would be helpful to be able to create/remove devices
and ports at run-time to trigger wwan port (un-)register actions without
module reloading.

Some simulator objects (e.g. ports) do not have the underling device and
it is not possible to fully manage the simulator via sysfs. wwan_hsim
intend for developers, so implement it as a self-contained debugfs based
management interface.
