drm/amdkfd: add owner ref param to get hmm pages

The parameter is used in the dev_private_owner to decide if device
pages in the range require to be migrated back to system memory, based
if they are or not in the same memory domain.
In this case, this reference could come from the same memory domain
with devices connected to the same hive.
