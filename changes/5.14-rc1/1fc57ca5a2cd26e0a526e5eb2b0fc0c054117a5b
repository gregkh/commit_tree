ext4: remove redundant assignment to error

Variable error is set to zero but this value is never read as it's not
used later on, hence it is a redundant assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

fs/ext4/ioctl.c:657:3: warning: Value stored to 'error' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
