KVM: arm64: Add ioctl to fetch/store tags in a guest

The VMM may not wish to have it's own mapping of guest memory mapped
with PROT_MTE because this causes problems if the VMM has tag checking
enabled (the guest controls the tags in physical RAM and it's unlikely
the tags are correct for the VMM).

Instead add a new ioctl which allows the VMM to easily read/write the
tags from guest memory, allowing the VMM's mapping to be non-PROT_MTE
while the VMM can still read/write the tags for the purpose of
migration.
