futex: Prepare futex_lock_pi() for runtime clock selection

futex_lock_pi() is the only futex operation which cannot select the clock
for timeouts (CLOCK_MONOTONIC/CLOCK_REALTIME). That's inconsistent and
there is no particular reason why this cannot be supported.

This was overlooked when CLOCK_REALTIME_FLAG was introduced and
unfortunately not reported when the inconsistency was discovered in glibc.

Prepare the function and enforce the CLOCK_REALTIME_FLAG on FUTEX_LOCK_PI
so that a new FUTEX_LOCK_PI2 can implement it correctly.
