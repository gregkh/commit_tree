iio: adis16475: do not return ints in irq handlers

On an IRQ handler we should not return normal error codes as 'irqreturn_t'
is expected.

This is done by jumping to the 'check_burst32' label where we return
'IRQ_HANDLED'. Note that it is fine to do the burst32 check in this
error path. If we have proper settings to apply burst32, we might just
do the setup now so that the next sample already uses it.
