component: Rename 'dev' to 'parent'

Let's rename this struct member to 'parent' to better reflect the
reality that it's the parent device of this psuedo-device. In the next
patch we'll put a 'struct device' inside of this struct so moving this
away simplifies that patch by reducing the number of places that 'dev'
is modified.
