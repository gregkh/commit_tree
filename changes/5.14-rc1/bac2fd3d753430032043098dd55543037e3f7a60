mac80211: remove use of ieee80211_get_he_sta_cap()

All uses of ieee80211_get_he_sta_cap() were actually wrong,
in net/mac80211/mlme.c they were wrong because that code is
also used for P2P (which is a different interface type), in
net/mac80211/main.c that should check all interface types.
Fix all that.
