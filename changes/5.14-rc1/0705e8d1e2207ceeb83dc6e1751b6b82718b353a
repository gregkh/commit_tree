ext4: inline jbd2_journal_[un]register_shrinker()

The function jbd2_journal_unregister_shrinker() was getting called
twice when the file system was getting unmounted.  On Power and ARM
platforms this was causing kernel crash when unmounting the file
system, when a percpu_counter was destroyed twice.

Fix this by removing jbd2_journal_[un]register_shrinker() functions,
and inlining the shrinker setup and teardown into
journal_init_common() and jbd2_journal_destroy().  This means that
ext4 and ocfs2 now no longer need to know about registering and
unregistering jbd2's shrinker.

Also, while we're at it, rename the percpu counter from
j_jh_shrink_count to j_checkpoint_jh_count, since this makes it
clearer what this counter is intended to track.
