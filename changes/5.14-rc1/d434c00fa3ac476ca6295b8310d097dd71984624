kvfree_rcu: Add a bulk-list check when a scheduler is run

The rcu_scheduler_active flag is set to RCU_SCHEDULER_RUNNING once the
scheduler is up and running.  That signal is used in order to check
and queue a "monitor work" to reclaim freed objects (if there are any)
during early boot.  This flag is used by kvfree_rcu() to determine when
work can safely be queued, at which point memory passed to earlier
invocations of kvfree_rcu() can be processed.

However, only "krcp->head" is checked for objects that need to be
released, and there are now two more, namely, "krcp->bkvhead[0]" and
"krcp->bkvhead[1]".  Therefore, check these two additional channels.
