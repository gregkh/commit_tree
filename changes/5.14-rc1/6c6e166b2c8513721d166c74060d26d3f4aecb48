KVM: x86/mmu: Don't WARN on a NULL shadow page in TDP MMU check

Treat a NULL shadow page in the "is a TDP MMU" check as valid, non-TDP
root.  KVM uses a "direct" PAE paging MMU when TDP is disabled and the
guest is running with paging disabled.  In that case, root_hpa points at
the pae_root page (of which only 32 bytes are used), not a standard
shadow page, and the WARN fires (a lot).
