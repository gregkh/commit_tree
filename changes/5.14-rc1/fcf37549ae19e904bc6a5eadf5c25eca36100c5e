jbd2: ensure abort the journal if detect IO error when writing original buffer back

Although we merged c044f3d8360 ("jbd2: abort journal if free a async
write error metadata buffer"), there is a race between
jbd2_journal_try_to_free_buffers() and jbd2_journal_destroy(), so the
jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() may still fail to detect the buffer write
io error flag which may lead to filesystem inconsistency.

jbd2_journal_try_to_free_buffers()     ext4_put_super()
                                        jbd2_journal_destroy()
  __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint()
  detect buffer write error              jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()
                                         jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()
                                           <--- lead to inconsistency
  jbd2_journal_abort()

Fix this issue by introducing a new atomic flag which only have one
JBD2_CHECKPOINT_IO_ERROR bit now, and set it in
__jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint() when freeing a checkpoint buffer
which has write_io_error flag. Then jbd2_journal_destroy() will detect
this mark and abort the journal to prevent updating log tail.
