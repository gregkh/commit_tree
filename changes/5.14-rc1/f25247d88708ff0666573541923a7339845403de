net: phy: realtek: net: Fix less than zero comparison of a u16

The comparisons of the u16 values priv->phycr1 and priv->phycr2 to less
than zero always false because they are unsigned. Fix this by using an
int for the assignment and less than zero check.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
