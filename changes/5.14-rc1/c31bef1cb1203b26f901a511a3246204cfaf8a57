drm/amd/display: Fix clock table filling logic

[Why]
Currently, the code that fills the clock table can miss filling
information about some of the higher voltage states advertised
by the SMU. This, in turn, may cause some of the higher pixel clock
modes (e.g. 8k60) to fail validation.

[How]
Fill the table with one entry per DCFCLK level instead of one entry
per FCLK level. This is needed because the maximum FCLK does not
necessarily need maximum voltage, whereas DCFCLK values from SMU
cover the full voltage range.
