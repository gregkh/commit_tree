proc: Avoid mixing integer types in mem_rw()

Use size_t when capping the count argument received by mem_rw(). Since
count is size_t, using min_t(int, ...) can lead to a negative value
that will later be passed to access_remote_vm(), which can cause
unexpected behavior.

Since we are capping the value to at maximum PAGE_SIZE, the conversion
from size_t to int when passing it to access_remote_vm() as "len"
shouldn't be a problem.
