clk: si5341: Allow different output VDD_SEL values

The driver was not previously programming the VDD_SEL values for each
output to indicate what external VDDO voltage was used for each. Add
ability to specify a regulator supplying the VDDO pin for each output of
the device. The voltage of the regulator is used to automatically set the
VDD_SEL value appropriately. If no regulator is specified and the chip is
being reconfigured, assume 2.5V which appears to be the chip default.
