powerpc/papr_scm: Properly handle UUID types and API

Parse to and export from UUID own type, before dereferencing.
This also fixes wrong comment (Little Endian UUID is something else)
and should eliminate the direct strict types assignments.

Fixes: 43001c52b603 ("powerpc/papr_scm: Use ibm,unit-guid as the iset cookie")
Fixes: 259a948c4ba1 ("powerpc/pseries/scm: Use a specific endian format for storing uuid from the device tree")
