KVM: X86: Introduce KVM_HC_MAP_GPA_RANGE hypercall

This hypercall is used by the SEV guest to notify a change in the page
encryption status to the hypervisor. The hypercall should be invoked
only when the encryption attribute is changed from encrypted -> decrypted
and vice versa. By default all guest pages are considered encrypted.

The hypercall exits to userspace to manage the guest shared regions and
integrate with the userspace VMM's migration code.
