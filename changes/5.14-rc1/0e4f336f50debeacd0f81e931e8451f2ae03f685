iio: chemical: atlas-sensor: Balance runtime pm + pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

The pm_runtime_put_noidle() call in remove isn't balanced with any get, so
drop it.  Note this isn't a bug as the runtime pm core will not allow the
reference count to go negative, making this a noop. However, it is
confusing to the reader so let's drop it.

pm_runtime_resume_and_get() replacement found using the coccicheck script
under review at:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210427141946.2478411-1-Julia.Lawall@inria.fr/

As pm_runtime_resume_and_get() returns <= 0 take advantage of that to
change the error checking to if (ret) which is more in keeping with the
rest of this driver.

This is a prequel to taking a closer look at the runtime pm in IIO drivers
in general.
