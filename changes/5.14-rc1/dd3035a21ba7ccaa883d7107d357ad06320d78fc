um: add a UML specific futex implementation

The generic asm futex implementation emulates atomic access to
memory by doing a get_user followed by put_user. These translate
to two mapping operations on UML with paging enabled in the
meantime. This, in turn may end up changing interrupts,
invoking the signal loop, etc.

This replaces the generic implementation by a mapping followed
by an operation on the mapped segment.
