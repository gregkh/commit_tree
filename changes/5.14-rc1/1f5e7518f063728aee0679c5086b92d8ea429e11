w1: ds2438: fixing bug that would always get page0

The purpose of the w1_ds2438_get_page function is to get the register
values at the page passed as the pageno parameter. However, the page0 was
hardcoded, such that the function always returned the page0 contents. Fixed
so that the function can retrieve any page.
