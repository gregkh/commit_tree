scsi: lpfc: Fix non-optimized ERSP handling

When processing an NVMe ERSP IU which didn't match the optimized CQE-only
path, the status was being left to the WQE status. WQE status is non-zero
as it is indicating a non-optimized completion that needs to be handled by
the driver.

Fix by clearing the status field when falling into the non-optimized
case. Log message added to track optimized vs non-optimized debug.
