drm/amd/display: Add Overflow check to skip MALL

[Why]
In some small modes (<200pixels) the stutter period is really big and will cause
overflow. In these cases we shouldnt try to enable MALL as it will exceeds range
of hysteresis timer (this can be seen in some IGT tests where the
plane size is small)

[How]
Compare the stutter_period with the frame time and if we will overflow
there is no point in trying to enable MALL (and see the ASSERT) so we
early exist in this case
