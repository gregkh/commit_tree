arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: Add support for SONY Xperia 1 II / 5 II (Edo platform)

Add support for SONY Xperia 1 II and 5 II smartphones (read one/five mark two).
They are based on the Qualcomm SM8250 chipset and both feature 5G modems. There
also exists a third Edo board, namely the Xperia PRO (PDX204), but it's $2500
and no developers have obtained it so far (to my knowledge).

The devices are affected by a scary UFS behaviour where sending a certain UFS
command (which is worked around on downstream) renders the device unbootable,
by effectively erasing the bootloader. Therefore UFS AND UFSPHY are strictly
disabled for now.

Downstream workaround:
