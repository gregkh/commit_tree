platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add info for the Goodix GT912 panel of TM800A550L tablets

The Bay Trail Glavey TM800A550L tablet, which ships with Android installed
from the factory, uses a GT912 touchscreen controller which needs to have
its firmware uploaded by the OS to work (this is a first for a x86 based
device with a Goodix touchscreen controller).

Add a touchscreen_dmi entry for this which specifies the filenames
to use for the firmware and config files needed for this.

Note this matches on a GDIX1001 ACPI HID, while the original DSDT uses
a HID of GODX0911. For the touchscreen to work on these devices a DSDT
override is necessary to fix a missing IRQ and broken GPIO settings in
the ACPI-resources for the touchscreen. This override also changes the
HID to the standard GDIX1001 id typically used for Goodix touchscreens.
The DSDT override is available here:
