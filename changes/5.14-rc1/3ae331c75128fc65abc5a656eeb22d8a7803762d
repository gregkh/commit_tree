RDMA/irdma: Add QoS definitions

Add definitions for managing the RDMA HW work scheduler (WS) tree.

A WS node is created via a control QP operation with the bandwidth
allocation, arbitration scheme, and traffic class of the QP specified.
The Qset handle returned associates the QoS parameters for the QP.
The Qset is registered with the LAN and an equivalent node is created
in the LAN packet scheduler tree.
