net: hns3: refactor dump qs shaper of debugfs

Currently, user gets qset shaper parameters by implementing debugfs
command "echo dump qs shaper > cmd", this command will dump info in
dmesg. It's unnecessary and heavy.

As there is "tm_qset" file in tm directory for dump qset info, to
optimize these command, merge qset shaper parameters to tm_qset
file and use cat command to get them.

The display style is below:
$ cat tm_qset
ID    MAP_PRI  LINK_VLD  MODE  DWRR  IR_B  IR_U  IR_S  BS_B  BS_S  FLAG
0000     0        1      dwrr  100   150     7     0     5    20     0
0001     0        0        sp    0   150     7     0     5    20     0
