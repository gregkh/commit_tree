powerpc/lib/code-patching: Don't use struct 'ppc_inst' for runnable code in tests.

'struct ppc_inst' is meant to represent an instruction internally, it
is not meant to dereference code in memory.

For testing code patching, use patch_instruction() to properly
write into memory the code to be tested.
