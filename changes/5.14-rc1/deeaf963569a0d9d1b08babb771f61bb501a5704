serial: mvebu-uart: correctly calculate minimal possible baudrate

For default (x16) scheme which is currently used by mvebu-uart.c driver,
maximal divisor of UART base clock is 1023*16. Therefore there is limit for
minimal supported baudrate. This change calculate it correctly and prevents
setting invalid divisor 0 into hardware registers.
