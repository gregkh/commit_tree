    drm: Auto-set allow_fb_modifiers when given modifiers at plane init

this is done automatically as part of plane init, if drivers set the
modifier list correctly. Which is the case here.

Note that this fixes an inconsistency: We've set the cap everywhere,
but only nv50+ supports modifiers. Hence cc stable, but not further
back then the patch from Paul.
