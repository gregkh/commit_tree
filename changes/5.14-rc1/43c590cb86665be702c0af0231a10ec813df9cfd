um: virtio/pci: enable suspend/resume

The UM virtual PCI devices currently cannot be suspended properly
since the virtio driver already disables VQs well before the PCI
bus's suspend_noirq wants to complete the transition by writing to
PCI config space.

After trying around for a long time with moving the devices on the
DPM list, trying to create dependencies between them, etc. I gave
up and instead added UML specific cross-driver API that lets the
virt-pci code enable not suspending/resuming VQs for its devices.

This then allows the PCI bus suspend_noirq to still talk to the
device, and suspend/resume works properly.
