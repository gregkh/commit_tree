cifs: decoding negTokenInit with generic ASN1 decoder

Decode negTokenInit with lib/asn1_decoder. For that,
add OIDs in linux/oid_registry.h and a negTokenInit
ASN1 file, "spnego_negtokeninit.asn1".
And define decoder's callback functions, which
are the gssapi_this_mech for checking SPENGO oid and
the neg_token_init_mech_type for getting authentication
mechanisms supported by a server.
