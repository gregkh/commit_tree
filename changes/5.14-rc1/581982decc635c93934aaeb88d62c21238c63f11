KVM: arm64: Use refcount at hyp to check page availability

The hyp buddy allocator currently checks the struct hyp_page list node
to see if a page is available for allocation or not when trying to
coalesce memory. Now that decrementing the refcount and attaching to
the buddy tree is done in the same critical section, we can rely on the
refcount of the buddy page to be in sync, which allows to replace the
list node check by a refcount check. This will ease removing the list
node from struct hyp_page later on.
