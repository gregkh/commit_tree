mtd: rawnand: Add a helper to find the closest ONFI NV-DDR mode

Introduce a similar helper to onfi_find_closest_sdr_mode(), but for
NV-DDR timings. It just takes a timing structure as parameter and
returns the closest mode by comparing all minimum timings. This is
useful for rigid controllers on which tuning the timings is not
possible.
