crypto: ccp - Annotate SEV Firmware file names

Annotate the firmware files CCP might need using MODULE_FIRMWARE().
This will get them included into an initrd when CCP is also included
there. Otherwise the CCP module will not find its firmware when loaded
before the root-fs is mounted.
This can cause problems when the pre-loaded SEV firmware is too old to
support current SEV and SEV-ES virtualization features.
