media: gspca/gl860: fix zero-length control requests

The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
implementation.

Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
will now trigger a warning.

Fix the gl860_RTx() helper so that zero-length control reads fail with
an error message instead. Note that there are no current callers that
would trigger this.
