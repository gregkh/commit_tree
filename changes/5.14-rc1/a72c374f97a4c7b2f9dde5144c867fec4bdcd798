block: mark queue init done at the end of blk_register_queue

Mark queue init done when everything is done well in blk_register_queue(),
so that wbt_enable_default() can be run quickly without any RCU period
involved since adding rq qos requires to freeze queue.

Also no any side effect by delaying to mark queue init done.
