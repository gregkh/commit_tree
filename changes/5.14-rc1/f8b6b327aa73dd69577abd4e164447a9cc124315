mxser: alloc struct mxser_board dynamically

There is no need to preallocate an array of four struct mxser_board's.
In most cases a single board or two will be present in a machine. So
allocate struct mxser_board as needed in ->probe.

This makes mxser_boards a bit array. There we store which indexes are
free (unallocated).
