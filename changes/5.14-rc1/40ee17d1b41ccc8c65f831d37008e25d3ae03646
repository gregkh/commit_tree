media: atmel: atmel-isc: add RLP to register offsets

The RLP submodule is a part of the atmel-isc pipeline, and stands for
Rounding,Limiting and Packaging. It used to extract specific data from the
ISC pipeline. For example if we want to output greyscale 8 bit, we would
use limiting to 8 bits, and packaging to Luma component only.
Add rlp to the reg offsets struct.
This will allow different products to have a different reg offset for this
particular module.
