thermal/drivers/int340x/processor_thermal: Split enumeration and processing part

Remove enumeration part from the processor_thermal_device to two
different modules. One for ACPI and one for PCI:
	ACPI enumeration: int3401_thermal
	PCI part: processor_thermal_device_pci_legacy

The current processor_thermal_device now just implements interface
functions to be used by the ACPI and PCI enumeration module. This is
done by:
1. Make functions proc_thermal_add() and proc_thermal_remove() non static
and export them for usage in other processor_thermal_device_pci_legacy.c
and in int3401_thermal.c.

2. Move the sysfs file creation for TCC offset and power limit attribute
group to the proc_thermal_add() from the individual enumeration callbacks
for PCI and ACPI.

3. Create new interface functions proc_thermal_mmio_add() and
proc_thermal_mmio_remove() which will be called from the
processor_thermal_device_pci_legacy module.

4. Export proc_thermal_resume(), so that it can be used by power
management callbacks.

5. Remove special check for double enumeration as it never happens.

While here, fix some cleanup on error conditions in proc_thermal_add().

No functional changes are expected with this change.
