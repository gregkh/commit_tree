scsi: target: core: Add the VERSION DESCRIPTOR fields to the INQUIRY data

Extend the standard INQUIRY data to 96 bytes and fill in the VERSION
DESCRIPTOR fields.

The layout follows SPC-4:

 - SCSI architecture standard
 - SCSI transport protocol standard
 - SCSI primary command set standard
 - SCSI device type command set standard

All version descriptor values are defined as "no version claimed" because
some initiators fail to recognize anything else.
