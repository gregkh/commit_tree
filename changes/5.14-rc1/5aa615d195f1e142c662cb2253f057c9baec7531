scsi: lpfc: Fix crash when lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() fails to initialize the SGLs

The driver is encountering a crash in lpfc_free_iocb_list() while
performing initial attachment.

Code review found this to be an errant failure path that was taken, jumping
to a tag that then referenced structures that were uninitialized.

Fix the failure path.
