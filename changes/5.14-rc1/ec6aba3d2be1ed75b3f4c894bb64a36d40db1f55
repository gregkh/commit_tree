kprobes: Remove kprobe::fault_handler

The reason for kprobe::fault_handler(), as given by their comment:

 * We come here because instructions in the pre/post
 * handler caused the page_fault, this could happen
 * if handler tries to access user space by
 * copy_from_user(), get_user() etc. Let the
 * user-specified handler try to fix it first.

Is just plain bad. Those other handlers are ran from non-preemptible
context and had better use _nofault() functions. Also, there is no
upstream usage of this.
