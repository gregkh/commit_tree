igc: Replace IGC_TX_FLAGS_XDP flag by an enum

Up to this point, Tx buffers are associated with either a skb or a xdpf,
and the IGC_TX_FLAGS_XDP flag was enough to distinguish between these
two case. However, with upcoming patches that will add AF_XDP zero-copy
support, a third case will be introduced so this flag-based approach
won't fit well.

In preparation to land AF_XDP zero-copy support, replace the
IGC_TX_FLAGS_XDP flag by an enum which will be extended once zero-copy
support is introduced to the driver.
