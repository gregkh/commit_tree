x86/fpu: Rename fxregs-related copy functions

The function names for fxsave/fxrstor operations are horribly named and
a permanent source of confusion.

Rename:
	copy_fxregs_to_kernel() to fxsave()
	copy_kernel_to_fxregs() to fxrstor()
	copy_fxregs_to_user() to fxsave_to_user_sigframe()
	copy_user_to_fxregs() to fxrstor_from_user_sigframe()

so it's clear what these are doing. All these functions are really low
level wrappers around the equally named instructions, so mapping to the
documentation is just natural.

While at it, replace the static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_FXSR) with
use_fxsr() to be consistent with the rest of the code.

No functional change.
