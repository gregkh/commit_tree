tools headers cpufeatures: Sync with the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  1348924ba8169f35 ("x86/msr: Define new bits in TSX_FORCE_ABORT MSR")
  cbcddaa33d7e11a0 ("perf/x86/rapl: Use CPUID bit on AMD and Hygon parts")

This only causes these perf files to be rebuilt:

  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memcpy-x86-64-asm.o
  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memset-x86-64-asm.o

And addresses this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h
