xfrm: replay: avoid xfrm replay notify indirection

replay protection is implemented using a callback structure and then
called via

   x->repl->notify(), x->repl->recheck(), and so on.

all the differect functions are always built-in, so this could be direct
calls instead.

This first patch prepares for removal of the x->repl structure.
Add an enum with the three available replay modes to the xfrm_state
structure and then replace all x->repl->notify() calls by the new
xfrm_replay_notify() helper.

The helper checks the enum internally to adapt behaviour as needed.
