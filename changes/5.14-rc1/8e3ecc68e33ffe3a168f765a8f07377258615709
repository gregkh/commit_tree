ACPI: LPSS: Use kstrtol() instead of simple_strtol()

The simple_strtol() function is not reliable in some situation, since
it does not check for the range overflow. Use kstrtol() instead.

While at it, modify the code to avoid evaluating _SEM unnecessarily
if uid_str is NULL or kstrtol() fails to convert that string to a
nonzero number.
