arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916-samsung-a2015: Add rt5033 battery

The Samsung Galaxy A3/A5 use a Richtek RT5033 PMIC as battery
fuel gauge, charger, flash LED and for some regulators. For now,
only add the fuel gauge/battery device to the device tree,
so we can check the remaining battery percentage.

The other RT5033 drivers need some more work first before
they can be used properly.
