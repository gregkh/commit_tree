platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add an extra entry for the upside down Goodix touchscreen on Teclast X89 tablets

Teclast X89 tablets come in 2 versions, with Windows pre-installed and with
Android pre-installed. These 2 versions have different DMI strings.

Add a match for the DMI strings used by the Android version BIOS.

Note the Android version BIOS has a bug in the DSDT where no IRQ is
provided, so for the touchscreen to work a DSDT override fixing this
is necessary as well.
