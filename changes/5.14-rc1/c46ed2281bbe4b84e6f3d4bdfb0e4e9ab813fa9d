tpm_tis_spi: add missing SPI device ID entries

The SPI core always reports a "MODALIAS=spi:<foo>", even if the device was
registered via OF. This means that this module won't auto-load if a DT has
for example has a node with a compatible "infineon,slb9670" string.

In that case kmod will expect a "MODALIAS=of:N*T*Cinfineon,slb9670" uevent
but instead will get a "MODALIAS=spi:slb9670", which is not present in the
kernel module aliases:

$ modinfo drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis_spi.ko | grep alias
alias:          of:N*T*Cgoogle,cr50C*
alias:          of:N*T*Cgoogle,cr50
alias:          of:N*T*Ctcg,tpm_tis-spiC*
alias:          of:N*T*Ctcg,tpm_tis-spi
alias:          of:N*T*Cinfineon,slb9670C*
alias:          of:N*T*Cinfineon,slb9670
alias:          of:N*T*Cst,st33htpm-spiC*
alias:          of:N*T*Cst,st33htpm-spi
alias:          spi:cr50
alias:          spi:tpm_tis_spi
alias:          acpi*:SMO0768:*

To workaround this issue, add in the SPI device ID table all the entries
that are present in the OF device ID table.
