openvswitch: add trace points

This makes openvswitch module use the event tracing framework
to log the upcall interface and action execution pipeline.  When
using openvswitch as the packet forwarding engine, some types of
debugging are made possible simply by using the ovs-vswitchd's
ofproto/trace command.  However, such a command has some
limitations:

  1. When trying to trace packets that go through the CT action,
     the state of the packet can't be determined, and probably
     would be potentially wrong.

  2. Deducing problem packets can sometimes be difficult as well
     even if many of the flows are known

  3. It's possible to use the openvswitch module even without
     the ovs-vswitchd (although, not common use).

Introduce the event tracing points here to make it possible for
working through these problems in kernel space.  The style is
copied from the mac80211 driver-trace / trace code for
consistency - this creates some checkpatch splats, but the
official 'guide' for adding tracepoints, as well as the existing
examples all add the same splats so it seems acceptable.
