media: i2c: ccs-core: fix pm_runtime_get_sync() usage count

The pm_runtime_get_sync() internally increments the
dev->power.usage_count without decrementing it, even on errors.

There is a bug at ccs_pm_get_init(): when this function returns
an error, the stream is not started, and RPM usage_count
should not be incremented. However, if the calls to
v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup() return errors, it will be kept
incremented.

At ccs_suspend() the best is to replace it by the new
pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), introduced by:
commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
in order to properly decrement the usage counter automatically,
in the case of errors.
