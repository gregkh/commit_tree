iio: light: tcs3472: Fix buffer alignment in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

To make code more readable, use a structure to express the channel
layout and ensure the timestamp is 8 byte aligned.

Found during an audit of all calls of uses of
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp().

Fixes tag is not strictly accurate as prior to that patch there was
potentially an unaligned write.  However, any backport past there will
need to be done manually.
