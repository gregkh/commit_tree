btrfs: add cancellation to resize

Accept literal string "cancel" as resize operation and interpret that
as a request to cancel the running operation. If it's running, wait
until it finishes current work and return ECANCELED.

Shrinking resize uses relocation to move the chunks away, use the
conditional exclusive operation start and cancellation helpers.
