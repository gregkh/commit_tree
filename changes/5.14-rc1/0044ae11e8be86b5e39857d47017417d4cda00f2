btrfs: make free space cache size consistent across different PAGE_SIZE

Currently free space cache inode size is determined by two factors:

- block group size
- PAGE_SIZE

This means, for the same sized block groups, with different PAGE_SIZE,
it will result in different inode sizes.

This will not be a good thing for subpage support, so change the
requirement for PAGE_SIZE to sectorsize.

Now for the same 4K sectorsize btrfs, it should result the same inode
size no matter what the PAGE_SIZE is.
