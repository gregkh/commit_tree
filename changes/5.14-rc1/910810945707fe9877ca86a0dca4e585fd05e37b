fsi: core: Fix return of error values on failures

Currently the cfam_read and cfam_write functions return the provided
number of bytes given in the count parameter and not the error return
code in variable rc, hence all failures of read/writes are being
silently ignored. Fix this by returning the error code in rc.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
