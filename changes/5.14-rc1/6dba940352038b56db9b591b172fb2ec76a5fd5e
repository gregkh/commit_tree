KVM: x86: Introduce KVM_GET_SREGS2 / KVM_SET_SREGS2

This is a new version of KVM_GET_SREGS / KVM_SET_SREGS.

It has the following changes:
   * Has flags for future extensions
   * Has vcpu's PDPTRs, allowing to save/restore them on migration.
   * Lacks obsolete interrupt bitmap (done now via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS)

New capability, KVM_CAP_SREGS2 is added to signal
the userspace of this ioctl.
