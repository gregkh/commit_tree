octeontx2-af: load NPC profile via firmware database

Currently NPC profile (KPU + MKEX) can be loaded using firmware
binary in filesystem scheme. Enhancing the functionality to load
NPC profile image from system firmware database. It uses the same
technique as used for loading MKEX profile. Firstly firmware binary
in kernel is checked for a valid image else tries to load NPC profile
from firmware database and at last uses default profile if no proper
image found.
