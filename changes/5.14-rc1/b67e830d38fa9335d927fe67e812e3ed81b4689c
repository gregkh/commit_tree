serial: 8250: 8250_omap: Fix possible interrupt storm on K3 SoCs

On K3 family of SoCs (which includes AM654 SoC), it is observed that RX
TIMEOUT is signalled after RX FIFO has been drained, in which case a
dummy read of RX FIFO is required to clear RX TIMEOUT condition.
Otherwise, this would lead to an interrupt storm.

Fix this by introducing UART_RX_TIMEOUT_QUIRK flag and doing a dummy
read in IRQ handler when RX TIMEOUT is reported with no data in RX FIFO.
