ASoC: SOF: Intel: Constify sof_probe_compressed_ops

The only usage of sof_probe_compressed_ops is to assign its address to
the compress_ops field in the snd_soc_component_driver struct, which is
a pointer to const. The assignment is done in sound/soc/sof/pcm.c. Make
it const to allow the compiler to put it in read-only memory.
