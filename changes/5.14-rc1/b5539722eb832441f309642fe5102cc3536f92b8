HID: hid-input: add Surface Go battery quirk

The Elantech touchscreen/digitizer in the Surface Go mistakenly reports
having a battery. This results in a low battery message every time you
try to use the pen.

This patch adds a quirk to ignore the non-existent battery and
gets rid of the false low battery messages.
