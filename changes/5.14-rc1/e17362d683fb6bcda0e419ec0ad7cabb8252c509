ARM: 9097/1: mmu: Declare section start/end correctly

The kernel test robot reported an interesting bug:

A debug print was using %08x with kernel_sec_start and kernel_sec_end
being phys_addr_t which can be either u32 or u64 (possibly more).

Actually these should just be declared as u32 to begin with: they are
declared as such in the assembly in head.S and the kernel definitely
boots in a 32 bit physical address space. Redeclare the kernel_sec_start
and kernel_sec_end to rid the bug.
