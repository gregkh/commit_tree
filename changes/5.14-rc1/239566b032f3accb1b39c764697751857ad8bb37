ARM: dts: aspeed: Set earlycon boot argument

Most of the aspeed boards have copied the 'earlyprink' string in
the bootargs. However, there's no earlyprink driver configured in the
defconfigs, so this does nothing.

A combination of setting stdout in the chosen node and adding earlycon
to bootargs causes early serial output to appear early. This changes all
boards to use this option.

The console=ttyS4,115200 option is still required, as this is used by
the run time uart driver.
