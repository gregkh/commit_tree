staging: vchiq_arm: tidy up service function naming

During a recent review Dan Carpenter reported that the function naming of
(un)lock_service is misleading. They are like wrapper around kref_get /
kref_put and don't have anything to do with locking. So use a name which
represent more the actual behavior. Btw add the vchiq prefix to avoid
possible name conflicts.
