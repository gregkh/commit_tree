ice: add support for auxiliary input/output pins

The E810 device supports programmable pins for enabling both input and
output events related to the PTP hardware clock. This includes both
output signals with programmable period, as well as timestamping of
events on input pins.

Add support for enabling these using the CONFIG_PTP_1588_CLOCK
interface.

This allows programming the software defined pins to take advantage of
the hardware clock features.
