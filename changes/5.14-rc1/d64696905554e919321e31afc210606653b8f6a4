Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts

The rlimit counter is tied to uid in the user_namespace. This allows
rlimit values to be specified in userns even if they are already
globally exceeded by the user. However, the value of the previous
user_namespaces cannot be exceeded.

Changelog

v11:
* Revert most of changes to fix performance issues.

v10:
* Fix memory leak on get_ucounts failure.
