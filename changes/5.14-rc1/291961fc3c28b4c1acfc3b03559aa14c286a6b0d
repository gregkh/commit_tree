perf script: Add API for filtering via dynamically loaded shared object

In some cases, users want to filter very large amounts of data (e.g.
from AUX area tracing like Intel PT) looking for something specific.
While scripting such as Python can be used, Python is 10 to 20 times
slower than C. So define a C API so that custom filters can be written
and loaded.
