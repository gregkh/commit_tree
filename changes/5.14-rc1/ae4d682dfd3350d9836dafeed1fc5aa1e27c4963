compiler_attributes.h: cleanups for GCC 4.9+

Since
commit 6ec4476ac825 ("Raise gcc version requirement to 4.9")
we no longer support building the kernel with GCC 4.8; drop the
preprocess checks for __GNUC_MINOR__ version. It's implied that if
__GNUC_MAJOR__ is 4, then the only supported version of __GNUC_MINOR__
left is 9.
