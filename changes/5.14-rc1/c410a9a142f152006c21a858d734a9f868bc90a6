cpuidle: teo: Change the main idle state selection logic

Two aspects of the current main idle state selection logic in the
TEO (Timer Events Oriented) cpuidle governor are quite questionable.

First of all, the "hits" and "misses" metrics used by it are only
updated for a given idle state if the time till the next timer event
("sleep length") is between the target residency of that state and
the target residency of the next one.  Consequently, they are likely
to become stale if the sleep length tends to fall outside that
interval which increases the likelihood of subomtimal idle state
selection.

Second, the decision on whether or not to select the idle state
"matching" the sleep length is based on the metrics collected for
that state alone, whereas in principle the metrics collected for
the other idle states should be taken into consideration when that
decision is made.  For example, if the measured idle duration is less
than the target residency of the idle state "matching" the sleep
length, then it is also less than the target residency of any deeper
idle state and that should be taken into account when considering
whether or not to select any of those states, but currently it is
not.

In order to address the above shortcomings, modify the main idle
state selection logic in the TEO governor to take the metrics
collected for all of the idle states into account when deciding
whether or not to select the one "matching" the sleep length.

Moreover, drop the "misses" metric that becomes redundant after the
above change and rename the "early_hits" metric to "intercepts" so
that its role is better reflected by its name (the idea being that
if a CPU wakes up earlier than indicated by the sleep length, then
it must be a result of a non-timer interrupt that "intercepts" the
CPU).

Also rename the states[] array in struct struct teo_cpu to
state_bins[] to avoid confusing it with the states[] array in
struct cpuidle_driver and update the documentation to match the
new code (and make it more comprehensive while at it).
