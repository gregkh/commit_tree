fs: dlm: don't allow half transmitted messages

This patch will clean a dirty page buffer if a reconnect occurs. If a page
buffer was half transmitted we cannot start inside the middle of a dlm
message if a node connects again. I observed invalid length receptions
errors and was guessing that this behaviour occurs, after this patch I
never saw an invalid message length again. This patch might drops more
messages for dlm version 3.1 but 3.1 can't deal with half messages as
well, for 3.2 it might trigger more re-transmissions but will not leave dlm
in a broken state.
