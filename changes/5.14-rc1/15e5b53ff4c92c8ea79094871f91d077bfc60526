s390/cpumf: remove WARN_ON_ONCE in counter start handler

Remove some WARN_ON_ONCE() warnings when a counter is started. Each
counter is installed function calls
event_sched_in() --> cpumf_pmu_add(..., PERF_EF_START).

This is done after the event has been created using
perf_pmu_event_init() which verifies the counter is valid.
Member hwc->config must be valid at this point.

Function cpumf_pmu_start(..., PERF_EF_RELOAD) is called from
function cpumf_pmu_add() for counter events. All other invocations of
cpumf_pmu_start(..., PERF_EF_RELOAD) are from the performance subsystem
for sampling events.
