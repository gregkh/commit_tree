watchdog: sbsa: Support architecture version 1

For Armv8.6, The frequency of CNTFRQ_EL0 is standardized to a
frequency of 1GHz, so Arm Base System Architecture 1.0[1] has
introduced watchdog revision 1 that increases the length the
watchdog offset register to 48 bit, while other operation of
the watchdog remains the same.

The driver can determine which version of the watchdog is
implemented through the watchdog interface identification
register (W_IID). If the version is 0x1, the watchdog
offset register will be 48 bit, otherwise it will be 32 bit.
