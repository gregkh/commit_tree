kcsan: Refactor passing watchpoint/other_info

The `watchpoint_idx` argument to kcsan_report() isn't meaningful for
races which were not detected by a watchpoint, and it would be clearer
if callers passed the other_info directly so that a NULL value can be
passed in this case.

Given that callers manipulate their watchpoints before passing the index
into kcsan_report_*(), and given we index the `other_infos` array using
this before we sanity-check it, the subsequent sanity check isn't all
that useful.

Let's remove the `watchpoint_idx` sanity check, and move the job of
finding the `other_info` out of kcsan_report().

Other than the removal of the check, there should be no functional
change as a result of this patch.
