Input: elants_i2c - fix NULL dereference at probing

The recent change in elants_i2c driver to support more chips
introduced a regression leading to Oops at probing.  The driver reads
id->driver_data, but the id may be NULL depending on the device type
the driver gets bound.

Replace the driver data extraction with the device_get_match_data()
helper, and define the driver data in OF table, too.
