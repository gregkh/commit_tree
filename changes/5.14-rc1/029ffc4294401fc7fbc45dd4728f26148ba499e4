ALSA: oxfw: perform sequence replay for media clock recovery

This commit takes ALSA oxfw driver to perform sequence replay for media
clock recovery. Unfortunately, OXFW970 ASIC and its firmware has a quirk
called jumbo payload which skips several isochronous cycles for packet
transmission, thus the sequence replay is just adopted to OXFW971 ASIC.
As well as Fireworks, OXFW ASICs also ignores presentation time against
the way in IEC 61883-1/6.

The sequence replay is tested with below models:
 * Tascam FireOne
 * Stanton Magnetics SCS.1m
 * Apogee Duet FireWire

For below models, the sequence replay is tested to be disabled:

 * Griffin FireWave
 * Behringer F-Control Audio 202
 * Loud Technology Tapco Link.FireWire 4x6
 * Loud Technology Mackie Onyx Satellite
