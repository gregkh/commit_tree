KVM: x86/mmu: Move nested NPT reserved bit calculation into MMU proper

Move nested NPT's invocation of reset_shadow_zero_bits_mask() into the
MMU proper and unexport said function.  Aside from dropping an export,
this is a baby step toward eliminating the call entirely by fixing the
shadow_root_level confusion.

No functional change intended.
