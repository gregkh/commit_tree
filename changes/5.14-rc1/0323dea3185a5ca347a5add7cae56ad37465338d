perf cs-etm: Delay decode of non-timeless data until cs_etm__flush_events()

Currently, timeless mode starts the decode on PERF_RECORD_EXIT, and
non-timeless mode starts decoding on the fist PERF_RECORD_AUX record.

This can cause the "data has no samples!" error if the first
PERF_RECORD_AUX record comes before the first (or any relevant)
PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 record because the mmaps are required by the decoder
to access the binary data.

This change pushes the start of non-timeless decoding to the very end of
parsing the file. The PERF_RECORD_EXIT event can't be used because it
might not exist in system-wide or snapshot modes.

I have not been able to find the exact cause for the events to be
intermittently in the wrong order in the basic scenario:

	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u top

But it can be made to happen every time with the --delay option. This is
because "enable_on_exec" is disabled, which causes tracing to start
before the process to be launched is exec'd. For example:

	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --delay=1 top
	perf report -D | grep 'AUX\|MAP'

Another scenario in which decoding from the first aux record fails is a
workload that forks. Although the aux record comes after 'bash', it
comes before 'top', which is what we are interested in. For example:

	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u -- bash -c top
	perf report -D | grep 'AUX\|MAP'

	4294967295 16853946421300 0x510 [0x70]: PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 8723/8723: [0x558f280000(0x142000) @ 0 00:17 5213953 0]: r-xp /usr/bin/bash

	4294967295 16853967181620 0x1888 [0x88]: PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 8723/8723: [0x7f9ed06000(0x34000) @ 0 00:17 5214354 0]: r-xp /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/ld-2.31.so

A third scenario is when the majority of time is spent in a shared
library that is not loaded at startup. For example a dynamically loaded
plugin.

Testing
=======

Testing was done by checking if any samples that are present in the
old output are missing from the new output. Timestamps must be
stripped out with awk because now they are set to the last AUX sample,
rather than the first:

	./perf script $4 | awk '!($4="")' > new.script
	./perf-default script $4 | awk '!($4="")' > default.script
	comm -13 <(sort -u new.script) <(sort -u default.script)

Testing showed that the new output is a superset of the old. When lines
appear in the comm output, it is not because they are missing but
because [unknown] is now resolved to sensible locations. For example
last putp branch here now resolves to libtinfo, so it's not missing
from the output, but is actually improved:

Old:
	top 305 [001]  1 branches:uH: 402830 _init+0x30 (/usr/bin/top.procps) => 404a1c [unknown] (/usr/bin/top.procps)
	top 305 [001]  1 branches:uH: 404a20 [unknown] (/usr/bin/top.procps) => 402970 putp@plt+0x0 (/usr/bin/top.procps)
	top 305 [001]  1 branches:uH: 40297c putp@plt+0xc (/usr/bin/top.procps) => 0 [unknown] ([unknown])
New:
	top 305 [001]  1 branches:uH: 402830 _init+0x30 (/usr/bin/top.procps) => 404a1c [unknown] (/usr/bin/top.procps)
	top 305 [001]  1 branches:uH: 404a20 [unknown] (/usr/bin/top.procps) => 402970 putp@plt+0x0 (/usr/bin/top.procps)
	top 305 [001]  1 branches:uH: 40297c putp@plt+0xc (/usr/bin/top.procps) => 7f8ab39208 putp+0x0 (/lib/libtinfo.so.5.9)

In the following two modes, decoding now works and the "data has no
samples!" error is not displayed any more:

	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u -- bash -c top
	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --delay=1 top

In snapshot mode, there is also an improvement to decoding. Previously
samples for the 'kill' process that was used to send SIGUSR2 were
completely missing, because the process hadn't started yet. But now
there are additional samples present:

	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --snapshot -a
	perf script

		stress 19380 [003] 161627.938153:    1000000    instructions:uH:      aaaabb612fb4 [unknown] (/usr/bin/stress)
		  kill 19644 [000] 161627.938153:    1000000    instructions:uH:      ffffae0ef210 [unknown] (/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/ld-2.27.so)
		stress 19380 [003] 161627.938153:    1000000    instructions:uH:      ffff9e754d40 random_r+0x20 (/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc-2.27.so)

Also tested was the round trip of 'perf inject' followed by 'perf
report' which has the same differences and improvements.
