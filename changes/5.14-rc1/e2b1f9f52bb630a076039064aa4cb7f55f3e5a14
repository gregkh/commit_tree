drm/amdkfd: refine the poison data consumption handling

The user applications maybe register the KFD_EVENT_TYPE_HW_EXCEPTION and
KFD_EVENT_TYPE_MEMORY events, driver could notify them when poison data
consumed. Beside that, some applications maybe register SIGBUS signal
hander. These applications will handle poison data by themselves, exit
or re-create context to re-dispatch works.
