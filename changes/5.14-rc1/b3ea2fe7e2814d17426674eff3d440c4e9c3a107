docs: hwmon: avoid using UTF-8 chars

While UTF-8 characters can be used at the Linux documentation,
the best is to use them only when ASCII doesn't offer a good replacement.
So, replace the occurences of the following UTF-8 characters:

	- U+2010 ('‐'): HYPHEN
	- U+2013 ('–'): EN DASH
	- U+2019 ('’'): RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
