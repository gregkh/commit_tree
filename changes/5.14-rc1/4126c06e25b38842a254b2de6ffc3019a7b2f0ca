xfs: Reverse apply 72b97ea40d

Originally we added this patch to help modularize the attr code in
preparation for delayed attributes and the state machine it requires.
However, later reviews found that this slightly alters the transaction
handling as the helper function is ambiguous as to whether the
transaction is diry or clean.  This may cause a dirty transaction to be
included in the next roll, where previously it had not.  To preserve the
existing code flow, we reverse apply this commit.
