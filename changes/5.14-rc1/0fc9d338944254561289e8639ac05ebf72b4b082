perf intel-pt: Add a tree for VMCS information

Even when VMX TSC Offset is not changing (during perf record), different
virtual machines can have different TSC Offsets. There is a Virtual Machine
Control Structure (VMCS) for each virtual CPU, the address of which is
reported to Intel PT in the VMCS packet. We do not know which VMCS belongs
to which virtual machine, so use a tree to keep track of VMCS information.
Then the decoder will be able to use the current VMCS value to look up the
current TSC Offset.
