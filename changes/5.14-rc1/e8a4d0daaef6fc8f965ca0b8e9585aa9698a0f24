scsi: hisi_sas: Speed up error handling when internal abort timeout occurs

If an internal task abort timeout occurs, the controller has developed a
fault, and needs to be reset to be recovered.

When this occurs during error handling, the current policy is to allow
error handling to continue, and the inevitable nexus ha reset will handle
the required reset.

However various steps of error handling need to taken before this happens.
These also involve some level of HW interaction, which will also fail with
various timeouts.

Speed up this process by recording a HW fault bit for an internal abort
timeout - when this is set, just automatically error any HW interaction,
and essentially go straight to clear nexus ha (to reset the controller).
