iwlwifi: mvm: fill phy_data.d1 for no-data RX

We don't fill in phy_data.d1 in no-data RX, and thus we
pretend some data is actually filled in radiotap when it
isn't or has default (zero) values.

Fill in phy_data.d1 appropriately, and while at it also
move the info_type initialization into the initializer.
