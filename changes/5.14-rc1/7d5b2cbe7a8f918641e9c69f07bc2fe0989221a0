comedi: remove editor modelines and cruft (again)

Commit fa60ce2cb450 ("treewide: remove editor modelines and cruft")
is different from what I submitted.

My original patch [1] did treewide cleanups including the comedi driver.

Unfortunately, commit 8ffdff6a8cfb ("staging: comedi: move out of staging
directory") moved drivers/staging/comedi/ to drivers/comedi/ before my
patch landed on Linus' tree from akpm tree.

If Andrew Morton had used Git, 'git merge' would have resolved such file
moves properly without any manual intervention.

Patches in akpm tree often get broken in his quilt workflows, and then
people end up with sending fixup patches.
