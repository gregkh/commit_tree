selftests/ftrace: fix event-no-pid on 1-core machine

When running event-no-pid test on small machines (e.g. cloud 1-core
instance), other events might not happen:

    + cat trace
    + cnt=0
    + [ 0 -eq 0 ]
    + fail No other events were recorded
    [15] event tracing - restricts events based on pid notrace filtering [FAIL]

Schedule a simple sleep task to be sure that some other process events
get recorded.
