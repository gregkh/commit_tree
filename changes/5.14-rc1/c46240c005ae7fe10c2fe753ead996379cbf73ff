ARM: tegra: acer-a500: Bump thermal trips by 10C

It's possible to hit the temperature of the thermal zone in a very warm
environment under a constant load, like watching a video using software
decoding. It's even easier to hit the limit with a slightly overclocked
CPU. Bump the temperature limit by 10C in order to improve user
experience. Acer A500 has a large board and 10" display panel which are
used for the heat dissipation, the SoC is placed far away from battery,
hence we can safely bump the temperature limit.
