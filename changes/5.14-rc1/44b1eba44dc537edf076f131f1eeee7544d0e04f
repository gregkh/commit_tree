bus: mhi: core: Fix power down latency

On graceful power-down/disable transition, when an MHI reset is
performed, the MHI device loses its context, including interrupt
configuration. However, the current implementation is waiting for
event(irq) driven state change to confirm reset has been completed,
which never happens, and causes reset timeout, leading to unexpected
high latency of the mhi_power_down procedure (up to 45 seconds).

Fix that by moving to the recently introduced poll_reg_field method,
waiting for the reset bit to be cleared, in the same way as the
power_on procedure.
