media: exynos-gsc: don't resume at remove time

Calling pm_runtime_get_sync() at driver's removal time is not
needed, as this will resume PM runtime. Also, the PM runtime
code at pm_runtime_disable() already calls it, if it detects
the need.

So, change the logic in order to disable PM runtime earlier.
