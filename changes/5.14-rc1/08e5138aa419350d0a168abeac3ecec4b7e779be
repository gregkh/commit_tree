eeprom: ee1004: Improve check for SMBUS features

We have to read 512 bytes only, therefore read performance isn't really
a concern. Don't bother the user if i2c block read isn't supported.

For i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated() to work it's sufficient
if I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_I2C_BLOCK or I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE_DATA is
supported. Therefore remove the check for I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_WORD_DATA.

In addition check for I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WRITE_BYTE (included in
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BYTE) which is needed for setting the page.
