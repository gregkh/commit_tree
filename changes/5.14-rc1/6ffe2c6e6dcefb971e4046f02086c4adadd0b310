KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Reduce irq_work vs guest decrementer races

irq_work's use of the DEC SPR is racy with guest<->host switch and guest
entry which flips the DEC interrupt to guest, which could lose a host
work interrupt.

This patch closes one race, and attempts to comment another class of
races.
