KVM: selftests: Genericize upper level page table entry struct

In preparation for adding hugepage support, replace "pageMapL4Entry",
"pageDirectoryPointerEntry", and "pageDirectoryEntry" with a common
"pageUpperEntry", and add a helper to create an upper level entry. All
upper level entries have the same layout, using unique structs provides
minimal value and requires a non-trivial amount of code duplication.

No functional change intended.
