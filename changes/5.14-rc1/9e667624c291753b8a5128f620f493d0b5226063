jump_label: Fix jump_label_text_reserved() vs __init

It turns out that jump_label_text_reserved() was reporting __init text
as being reserved past the time when the __init text was freed and
re-used.

For a long time, this resulted in, at worst, not being able to kprobe
text that happened to land at the re-used address. However a recent
commit e7bf1ba97afd ("jump_label, x86: Emit short JMP") made it a
fatal mistake because it now needs to read the instruction in order to
determine the conflict -- an instruction that's no longer there.

Fixes: 4c3ef6d79328 ("jump label: Add jump_label_text_reserved() to reserve jump points")
