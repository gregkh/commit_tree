hwmon: (sht4x) Fix sht4x_read_values return value

Kernel doc for sht4x_read_values() shows 0 on success, 1 on failure but
the return value on success is actually always positive as it is set to
SHT4X_RESPONSE_LENGTH by a successful call to i2c_master_recv().

Miscellanea:

o Update the kernel doc for sht4x_read_values to 0 for success or -ERRNO
o Remove incorrectly used kernel doc /** header for other _read functions
o Typo fix succesfull->successful
o Reverse a test to unindent a block and use goto unlock
o Declare cmd[SHT4X_CMD_LEN] rather than cmd[]

At least for gcc 10.2, object size is reduced a tiny bit.
