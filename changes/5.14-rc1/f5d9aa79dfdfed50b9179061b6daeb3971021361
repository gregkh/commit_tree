ARM: imx6q: remove clk-out fixup for the Atheros AR8031 and AR8035 PHYs

This configuration should be set over device tree.

If this patch breaks network functionality on your system, enable the
AT803X_PHY driver and set following device tree property in the PHY
node:

    qca,clk-out-frequency = <125000000>;
