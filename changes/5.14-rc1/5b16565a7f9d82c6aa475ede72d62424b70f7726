iwlwifi: support ver 6 of WOWLAN_CONFIGURATION and ver 10 of WOWLAN_GET_STATUSES

These two version updates deprecate the need to set/get the nonqos sequence
counter during suspend/resume flow respectively; NICs supporting this
version maintain this counter internally and don't lose it during the
suspend/resume flow.

Note that this means that for such NICs the NON_QOS_TX_COUNTER_CMD is no
longer ever sent.
