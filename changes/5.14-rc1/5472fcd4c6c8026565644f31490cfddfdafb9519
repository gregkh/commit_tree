KVM: x86/mmu: Get nested MMU's root level from the MMU's role

Initialize the MMU's (guest) root_level using its mmu_role instead of
redoing the calculations.  The role_regs used to calculate the mmu_role
are initialized from the vCPU, i.e. this should be a complete nop.

No functional change intended.
