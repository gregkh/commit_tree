clk: tegra: clk-tegra124-dfll-fcpu: don't use devm functions for regulator

The purpose of the device-managed functions is to bind the life-time of an
object to that of a parent device object.

This is not the case for the 'vdd-cpu' regulator in this driver. A
reference is obtained via devm_regulator_get() and immediately released
with devm_regulator_put().

In this case, the usage of devm_ functions is slightly excessive, as the
un-managed versions of these functions is a little cleaner (and slightly
more economical in terms of allocation).

This change converts the devm_regulator_{get,put}() to
regulator_{get,put}() in the get_alignment_from_regulator() function of
this driver.
