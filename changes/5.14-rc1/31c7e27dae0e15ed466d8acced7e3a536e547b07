perf intel-pt: Better 7-byte timestamp wraparound logic

A timestamp should not go backwards. If it does it is assumed that the
 7-byte TSC packet value has wrapped. Improve that logic so that it will
not allow the timestamp to go past the buffer timestamp (which is recorded
when the buffer is copied out)
