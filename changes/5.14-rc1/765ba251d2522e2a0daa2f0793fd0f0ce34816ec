media: subdev: remove VIDIOC_DQEVENT_TIME32 handling

Converting the VIDIOC_DQEVENT_TIME32/VIDIOC_DQEVENT32/
VIDIOC_DQEVENT32_TIME32 arguments to the canonical form is done in common
code, but for some reason I ended up adding another conversion helper to
subdev_do_ioctl() as well. I must have concluded that this does not go
through the common conversion, but it has done that since the ioctl
handler was first added.

I assume this one is harmless as there should be no way to arrive here
from user space if CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME is set, but since it is dead
code, it should just get removed.

On a 64-bit architecture, as well as a 32-bit architecture without
CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME, handling this command is a mistake,
and the kernel should return an error.
