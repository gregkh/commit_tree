arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Disable PON on Trogdor

We don't use the PON module on Trogdor devices. Instead the reboot
reason is sort of stored in the 'eventlog' and the bootloader figures
out if the boot is abnormal and records that there. Disable the PON node
and then drop the power key disabling because that's a child node that
will no longer be enabled if the PON node is disabled.
