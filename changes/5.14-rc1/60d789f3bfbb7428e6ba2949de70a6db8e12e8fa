usb: isp1760: add support for isp1763

isp1763 have some differences from the isp1760, 8 bit address for
registers and 16 bit for values, no bulk access to memory addresses,
16 PTD's instead of 32.

Following the regmap work done before add the registers, memory access
and add the functions to support differences in setup sequences.
