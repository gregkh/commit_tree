staging: rtl8188eu: remove include/rtw_debug.h header

Remove include/rtw_debug.h header file, as this isn't used and gets
rid of the various other definitions we don't need. Also move the
DRIVERVERSION constant value directly to os_dep/os_intfs.c as it is
only used there anyway. This results in removal of more unnecessary code.
