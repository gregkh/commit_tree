powerpc/pseries/vas: Integrate API with open/close windows

This patch adds VAS window allocatioa/close with the corresponding
hcalls. Also changes to integrate with the existing user space VAS
API and provide register/unregister functions to NX pseries driver.

The driver register function is used to create the user space
interface (/dev/crypto/nx-gzip) and unregister to remove this entry.

The user space process opens this device node and makes an ioctl
to allocate VAS window. The close interface is used to deallocate
window.
