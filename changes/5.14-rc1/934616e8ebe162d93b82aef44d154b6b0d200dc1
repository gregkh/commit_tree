iio: light: rpr0521: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Calls to pm_runtime_put_noidle in probe() error path and remove() are
not match to any get() calls.

The runtime pm core protects against negative reference counts, so this
doesn't have any visible impact beyond confusing the reader.

Whilst here use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to replace boilerplate.
