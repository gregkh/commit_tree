dm: Fix dm_accept_partial_bio() relative to zone management commands

Fix dm_accept_partial_bio() to actually check that zone management
commands are not passed as explained in the function documentation
comment. Also, since a zone append operation cannot be split, add
REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND as a forbidden command.

White lines are added around the group of BUG_ON() calls to make the
code more legible.
