KVM: arm64: Use less bits for hyp_page refcount

The hyp_page refcount is currently encoded on 4 bytes even though we
never need to count that many objects in a page. Make it 2 bytes to save
some space in the vmemmap.

As overflows are more likely to happen as well, make sure to catch those
with a BUG in the increment function.
