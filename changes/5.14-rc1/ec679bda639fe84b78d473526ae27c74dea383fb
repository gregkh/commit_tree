spi: bcm2835: Allow arbitrary number of slaves

Since commit 571e31fa60b3 ("spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for
->prepare_message()"), the number of slaves has been limited by a
compile-time constant.  This was necessitated by statically-sized
arrays in the driver private data which contain per-slave register
values.

As suggested by Mark, move those register values to a per-slave
controller_state which is allocated on ->setup and freed on ->cleanup.
The limitation on the number of slaves is thus lifted.
