staging: rtl8723bs: add two functions to improve register dump in core/rtw_debug.c

Beautify register dump by adding two functions printing
four register values per line. This is necessary after
old macro replacement with netdev_dbg(), the former
wrapped a raw printk, the latter
prints lots of driver information overhead per line
for each call. So avoid this noisy behaviour by dumping
four values on each line.
