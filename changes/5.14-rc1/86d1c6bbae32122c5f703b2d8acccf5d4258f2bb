spi: stm32-qspi: add automatic poll status feature

STM32 QSPI is able to automatically poll a specified register inside the
memory and relieve the CPU from this task.

As example, when erasing a large memory area, we got cpu load
equal to 50%. This patch allows to perform the same operation
with a cpu load around 2%.
