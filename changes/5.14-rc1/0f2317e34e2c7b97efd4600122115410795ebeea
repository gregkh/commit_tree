mm: make compound_head const-preserving

If you pass a const pointer to compound_head(), you get a const pointer
back; if you pass a mutable pointer, you get a mutable pointer back.  Also
remove an unnecessary forward definition of struct page; we're about to
dereference page->compound_head, so it must already have been defined.
