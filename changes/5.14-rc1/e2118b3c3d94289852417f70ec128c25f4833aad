dm: rearrange core declarations for extended use from dm-zone.c

Move the definitions of struct dm_target_io, struct dm_io and the bits
of the flags field of struct mapped_device from dm.c to dm-core.h to
make them usable from dm-zone.c. For the same reason, declare
dec_pending() in dm-core.h after renaming it to dm_io_dec_pending().
And for symmetry of the function names, introduce the inline helper
dm_io_inc_pending() instead of directly using atomic_inc() calls.
