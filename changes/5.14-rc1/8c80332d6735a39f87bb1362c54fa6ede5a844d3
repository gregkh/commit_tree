drm/i915/adl_p: Handle TC cold

On ADL-P TC cold is exited and blocked when legacy aux is powered,
that is exacly the same of what ICL need for static TC ports.

TODO: When a TBT hub or monitor is connected it will cause TBT and
legacy aux to be powered at the same time, hopefully this will not
cause any issues but if it do, some rework will be needed.

v2:
 - skip icl_tc_port_assert_ref_held() warn on, adl-p uses aux to
   block TC cold

v3:
 - Drop icl_tc_port_assert_ref_held() earlier return for adl_p, not
   needed anymore
 - Set timeout_expected when enabling aux power well as port could be
   disconnected when tc_cold_block() is called
