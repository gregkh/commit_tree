nvmet-fc: do not check for invalid target port in nvmet_fc_handle_fcp_rqst()

When parsing a request in nvmet_fc_handle_fcp_rqst() we should not
check for invalid target ports; if we do the command is aborted
from the fcp layer, causing the host to assume a transport error.
Rather we should still forward this request to the nvmet layer, which
will then correctly fail the command with an appropriate error status.
