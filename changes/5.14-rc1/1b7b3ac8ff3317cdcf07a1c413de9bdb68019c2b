cfg80211: set custom regdomain after wiphy registration

We used to set regulatory info before the registration of
the device and then the regulatory info didn't get set, because
the device isn't registered so there isn't a device to set the
regulatory info for. So set the regulatory info after the device
registration.
Call reg_process_self_managed_hints() once again after the device
registration because it does nothing before it.
