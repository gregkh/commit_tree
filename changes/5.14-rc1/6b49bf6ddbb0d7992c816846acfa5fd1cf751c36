mm: rename migrate_pgmap_owner

MMU notifier ranges have a migrate_pgmap_owner field which is used by
drivers to store a pointer.  This is subsequently used by the driver
callback to filter MMU_NOTIFY_MIGRATE events.  Other notifier event types
can also benefit from this filtering, so rename the 'migrate_pgmap_owner'
field to 'owner' and create a new notifier initialisation function to
initialise this field.
