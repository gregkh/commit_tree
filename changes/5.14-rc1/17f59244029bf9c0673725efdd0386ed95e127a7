net: hns3: add support for handling all errors through MSI-X

Currently, hardware errors can be reported through AER or MSI-X mode.
However, the AER mode is intended to handle only bus errors, but not
hardware errors. On the other hand, virtual machines cannot handle
AER errors. When an AER error is reported, virtual machines will be
suspended. So add support for handling all these hardware errors
through MSI-X mode which depends on a newer version of firmware,
and reserve the handler of the AER mode for compatibility.
