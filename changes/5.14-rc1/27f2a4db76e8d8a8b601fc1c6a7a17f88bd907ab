Makefile: fix GDB warning with CONFIG_RELR

GDB produces the following warning when debugging kernels built with
CONFIG_RELR:

BFD: /android0/linux-next/vmlinux: unknown type [0x13] section `.relr.dyn'

when loading a kernel built with CONFIG_RELR into GDB. It can also
prevent debugging symbols using such relocations.

Peter sugguests:
  [That flag] means that lld will use dynamic tags and section type
  numbers in the OS-specific range rather than the generic range. The
  kernel itself doesn't care about these numbers; it determines the
  location of the RELR section using symbols defined by a linker script.
