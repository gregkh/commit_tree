x86/pkru: Remove xstate fiddling from write_pkru()

The PKRU value of a task is stored in task->thread.pkru when the task is
scheduled out. PKRU is restored on schedule in from there. So keeping the
XSAVE buffer up to date is a pointless exercise.

Remove the xstate fiddling and cleanup all related functions.
