media: cobalt: fix race condition in setting HPD

The cobalt_s_bit_sysctrl reads the old register value over PCI,
then changes a bit and sets writes the new value to the register.

This is used among other things for setting the HPD output pin.

But if the HPD is changed for multiple inputs at the same time,
then this causes a race condition where a stale value is read.

Serialize this function with a mutex.
