fs: dlm: reconnect if socket error report occurs

This patch will change the reconnect handling that if an error occurs
if a socket error callback is occurred. This will also handle reconnects
in a non blocking connecting case which is currently missing. If error
ECONNREFUSED is reported we delay the reconnect by one second.
