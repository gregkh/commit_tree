netpoll: avoid put_unaligned() on single character

With a planned cleanup, using put_unaligned() on a single character
results in a harmless warning:

In file included from ./arch/x86/include/generated/asm/unaligned.h:1,
                 from include/linux/etherdevice.h:24,
                 from net/core/netpoll.c:18:
net/core/netpoll.c: In function 'netpoll_send_udp':

  431 |   put_unaligned(0x60, (unsigned char *)ip6h);

Replace this with an open-coded pointer dereference.
