locking/atomic: atomic: remove redundant include

Since commit:

  560cb12a4080a48b ("locking,arch: Rewrite generic atomic support")

... we conditionally include <linux/irqflags.h> before defining atomics
using locking, and hence do not need to do so unconditionally later in
the header.

This patch removes the redundant include.
