btrfs: refactor page status update into process_one_page()

In __process_pages_contig() we update page status according to page_ops.

That update process is a bunch of 'if' branches, which lie inside
two loops, this makes it pretty hard to expand for later subpage
operations.

So this patch will extract these operations into its own function,
process_one_pages().

Also since we're refactoring __process_pages_contig(), also move the new
helper and __process_pages_contig() before the first caller of them, to
remove the forward declaration.
