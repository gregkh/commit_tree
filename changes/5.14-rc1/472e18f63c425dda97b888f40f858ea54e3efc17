ALSA: hda: Release controller display power during shutdown/reboot

Make sure the HDA driver's display power reference is released during
shutdown/reboot.

During the shutdown/reboot sequence the pci device core calls the
pm_runtime_resume handler for all devices before calling the driver's
shutdown callback and so the HDA driver's runtime resume callback will
acquire a display power reference (on HSW/BDW). This triggers a power
reference held WARN on HSW/BDW in the i915 driver's subsequent shutdown
handler, which expects all display power references to be released by
that time.

Since the HDA controller is stopped in the shutdown handler in any case,
let's follow here the same sequence as the one during runtime suspend.
This will also reset the HDA link and drop the display power reference,
getting rid of the above WARN.

Tested on HSW.

v2:
- Fix the build for CONFIG_PM=n (Takashi)
- s/__azx_runtime_suspend/azx_shutdown_chip/
