srcu: Fix broken node geometry after early ssp init

An srcu_struct structure that is initialized before rcu_init_geometry()
will have its srcu_node hierarchy based on CONFIG_NR_CPUS.  Once
rcu_init_geometry() is called, this hierarchy is compressed as needed
for the actual maximum number of CPUs for this system.

Later on, that srcu_struct structure is confused, sometimes referring
to its initial CONFIG_NR_CPUS-based hierarchy, and sometimes instead
to the new num_possible_cpus() hierarchy.  For example, each of its
->mynode fields continues to reference the original leaf rcu_node
structures, some of which might no longer exist.  On the other hand,
srcu_for_each_node_breadth_first() traverses to the new node hierarchy.

There are at least two bad possible outcomes to this:

1) a) A callback enqueued early on an srcu_data structure (call it
      *sdp) is recorded pending on sdp->mynode->srcu_data_have_cbs in
      srcu_funnel_gp_start() with sdp->mynode pointing to a deep leaf
      (say 3 levels).

   b) The grace period ends after rcu_init_geometry() shrinks the
      nodes level to a single one.  srcu_gp_end() walks through the new
      srcu_node hierarchy without ever reaching the old leaves so the
      callback is never executed.

   This is easily reproduced on an 8 CPUs machine with CONFIG_NR_CPUS >= 32
   and "rcupdate.rcu_self_test=1". The srcu_barrier() after early tests
   verification never completes and the boot hangs:

2) An srcu_struct structure that is initialized before rcu_init_geometry()
   and used afterward will always have stale rdp->mynode references,
   resulting in callbacks to be missed in srcu_gp_end(), just like in
   the previous scenario.

This commit therefore causes init_srcu_struct_nodes to initialize the
geometry, if needed.  This ensures that the srcu_node hierarchy is
properly built and distributed from the get-go.
