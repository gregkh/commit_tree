scsi: mpi3mr: Add support for recovering controller

Detection of firmware fault or any kind of unresponsiveness in the
controller (any admin command which times out) results in resetting the
controller. The primary reset mechanisms used are either soft reset or diag
fault reset. A reset is performed if the host sets the ResetAction field in
the HostDiagnostic register to either 001b (soft reset) or 007b (diag fault
reset). After successfully resetting the controller the driver
reinitializes the controller by going through start of the day
initialization procedure. Pending I/Os during the reset are returned back
to the SCSI midlayer for retry.
