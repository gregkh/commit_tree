powerpc: Rework PPC_RAW_xxx() macros for prefixed instructions

At the time being, we have PPC_RAW_PLXVP() and PPC_RAW_PSTXVP() which
provide a 64 bits value, and then it gets split by open coding to
format it into a 'struct ppc_inst' instruction.

Instead, define a PPC_RAW_xxx_P() and a PPC_RAW_xxx_S() to be used
as is.
