cxl/mem: Move register locator logic into reg setup

Start moving code around to ultimately get rid of @cxlm.base. The
@cxlm.base member serves no purpose other than intermediate storage of
the offset found in cxl_mem_map_regblock() later used by
cxl_mem_setup_regs(). Aside from wanting to get rid of this useless
member, it will help later when adding new register block identifiers.

While @cxlm.base still exists, it will become trivial to remove it in a
future patch.

No functional change is meant to be introduced in this patch.
