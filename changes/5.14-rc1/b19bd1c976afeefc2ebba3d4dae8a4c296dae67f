mm/mmzone.h: simplify is_highmem_idx()

There is a lot of historical ifdefery in is_highmem_idx() and its helper
zone_movable_is_highmem() that was required because of two different paths
for nodes and zones initialization that were selected at compile time.

Until commit 3f08a302f533 ("mm: remove CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP
option") the movable_zone variable was only available for configurations
that had CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP enabled so the test in
zone_movable_is_highmem() used that variable only for such configurations.
For other configurations the test checked if the index of ZONE_MOVABLE
was greater by 1 than the index of ZONE_HIGMEM and then movable zone was
considered a highmem zone.  Needless to say, ZONE_MOVABLE - 1 equals
ZONE_HIGHMEM by definition when CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y.

Commit 3f08a302f533 ("mm: remove CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP option")
made movable_zone variable always available.  Since this variable is set
to ZONE_HIGHMEM if CONFIG_HIGHMEM is enabled and highmem zone is
populated, it is enough to check whether

	zone_idx == ZONE_MOVABLE && movable_zone == ZONE_HIGMEM

to test if zone index points to a highmem zone.

Remove zone_movable_is_highmem() that is not used anywhere except
is_highmem_idx() and use the test above in is_highmem_idx() instead.
