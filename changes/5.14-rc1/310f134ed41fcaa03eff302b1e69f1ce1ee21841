x86/sev: Add defines for GHCB version 2 MSR protocol requests

Add the necessary defines for supporting the GHCB version 2 protocol.
This includes defines for:

	- MSR-based AP hlt request/response
	- Hypervisor Feature request/response

This is the bare minimum of requests that need to be supported by a GHCB
version 2 implementation. There are more requests in the specification,
but those depend on Secure Nested Paging support being available.

These defines are shared between SEV host and guest support.

        Simplify the brewing macro maze into readability. ]
