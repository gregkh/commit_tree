ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: remove hdac-hdmi support

Remove support for using hdac_hdmi codec driver. No known products use
this configuration and hdac_hdmi cannot support all the platforms
sof_sdw does.

This change also fixes a bug in Kconfig rules.
SND_SOC_INTEL_SOUNDWIRE_SOF_MACH did not have a select SND_SOC_HDAC_HDMI
and this could cause build failures.
