RDMA/rtrs-srv: Set minimal max_send_wr and max_recv_wr

Currently rtrs when create_qp use a coarse numbers (bigger in general),
which leads to hardware create more resources which only waste memory with
no benefits.

For max_send_wr, we don't really need alway max_qp_wr size when creating
qp, reduce it to cq_size.

For max_recv_wr,  cq_size is enough.

With the patch when sess_queue_depth=128, per session (2 paths) memory
consumption reduced from 188 MB to 65MB

When always_invalidate is enabled, we need send more wr, so treat it
special.
