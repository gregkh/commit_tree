brcmfmac: Add clm_blob firmware files to modinfo

Cypress Wi-Fi chipsets include information regarding regulatory
constraints. These are provided to the driver through "Country Local
Matrix" (CLM) blobs. Files present in Linux firmware repository are
on a generic world-wide safe version with conservative power
settings which is designed to comply with regulatory but may not
provide best performance on all boards. Never the less, a better
functionality can be expected with the file present, so add it to the
modinfo of the driver.
