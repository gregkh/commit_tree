scsi: lpfc: Fix Node recovery when driver is handling simultaneous PLOGIs

When lpfc is handling a solicited and unsolicited PLOGI with another
initiator, the remote initiator is never recovered. The node for the
initiator is erroneouosly removed and all resources released.

In lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), when lpfc_els_retry() returns a failure code, the
driver is calling the state machine with a device remove event because the
remote port is not currently registered with the SCSI or NVMe
transports. The issue is that on a PLOGI "collision" the driver correctly
aborts the solicited PLOGI and allows the unsolicited PLOGI to complete the
process, but this process is interrupted with a device_rm event.

Introduce logic in the PLOGI completion to capture the PLOGI collision
event and jump out of the routine.  This will avoid removal of the node.
If there is no collision, the normal node removal will occur.
