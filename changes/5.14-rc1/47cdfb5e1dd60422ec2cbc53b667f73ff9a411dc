btrfs: zoned: print message when zone sanity check type fails

This extends patch 784daf2b9628 ("btrfs: zoned: sanity check zone
type"), the message was supposed to be there but was lost during merge.
We want to make the error noticeable so add it.

Fixes: 784daf2b9628 ("btrfs: zoned: sanity check zone type")
