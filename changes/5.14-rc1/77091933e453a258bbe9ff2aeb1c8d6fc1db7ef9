net: mdio: ipq8064: enlarge sleep after read/write operation

With the use of the qca8k dsa driver, some problem arised related to
port status detection. With a load on a specific port (for example a
simple speed test), the driver starts to behave in a strange way and
garbage data is produced. To address this, enlarge the sleep delay and
address a bug for the reg offset 31 that require additional delay for
this specific reg.
