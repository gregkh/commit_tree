nfp: flower-ct: add nft callback stubs

Add register/unregister of the nft callback. For now just add
stub code to accept the flows, but don't do anything with it.
Decided to accept the flows since netfilter will keep on trying
to offload a flow if it was rejected, which is quite noisy.
Follow-up patches will start implementing the functions to add
nft flows to the relevant tables.
