iio: accel: mxc4005: Fix overread of data and alignment issue.

The bulk read size is based on the size of an array that also has
space for the timestamp alongside the channels.
Fix that and also fix alignment of the buffer passed
to iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp.

Found during an audit of all calls to this function.

Fixes: 1ce0eda0f757 ("iio: mxc4005: add triggered buffer mode for mxc4005")
