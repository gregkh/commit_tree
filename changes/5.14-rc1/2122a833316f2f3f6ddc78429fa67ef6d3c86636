arm64: Allow mismatched 32-bit EL0 support

When confronted with a mixture of CPUs, some of which support 32-bit
applications and others which don't, we quite sensibly treat the system
as 64-bit only for userspace and prevent execve() of 32-bit binaries.

Unfortunately, some crazy folks have decided to build systems like this
with the intention of running 32-bit applications, so relax our
sanitisation logic to continue to advertise 32-bit support to userspace
on these systems and track the real 32-bit capable cores in a cpumask
instead. For now, the default behaviour remains but will be tied to
a command-line option in a later patch.
