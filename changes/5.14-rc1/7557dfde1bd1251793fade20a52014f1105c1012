ssb: Remove redundant assignment to err

Variable 'err' is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/ssb/main.c:1306:3: warning: Value stored to 'err' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
drivers/ssb/main.c:1312:3: warning: Value stored to 'err' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
