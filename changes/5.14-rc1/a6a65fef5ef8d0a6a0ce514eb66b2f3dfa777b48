xfs: log stripe roundoff is a property of the log

We don't need to look at the xfs_mount and superblock every time we
need to do an iclog roundoff calculation. The property is fixed for
the life of the log, so store the roundoff in the log at mount time
and use that everywhere.

On a debug build:

$ size fs/xfs/xfs_log.o.*
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  27360	    560	      8	  27928	   6d18	fs/xfs/xfs_log.o.orig
  27219	    560	      8	  27787	   6c8b	fs/xfs/xfs_log.o.patched
