net/mlx5e: TC: Reserved bit 31 of REG_C1 for IPsec offload

Currently ASAP features fully utilize all the bits of the CQE's flow tag
and ft_metadata field. The flow tag field cannot be used because the
flow table tagging in FTE does not allow partial write.

We agree to reserve bit 31 of CQE's ft_metadata for IPsec to avoid
ASAP CT from dropping IPsec offloaded packet

Here is the new bit layout of REG_C1. Tunnel option id is reduced to
11 bits:
< IPSEC MARKER (1) | ESW_TUN_ID(12) | ESW_TUN_OPTS(11) | ESW_ZONE_ID(8) >
