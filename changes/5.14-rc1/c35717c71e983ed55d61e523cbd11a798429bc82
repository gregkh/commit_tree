powerpc: Set ARCH_HAS_STRICT_MODULE_RWX

To enable strict module RWX on powerpc, set:

    CONFIG_STRICT_MODULE_RWX=y

You should also have CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX=y set to have any real
security benefit.

ARCH_HAS_STRICT_MODULE_RWX is set to require ARCH_HAS_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX.
This is due to a quirk in arch/Kconfig and arch/powerpc/Kconfig that
makes STRICT_MODULE_RWX *on by default* in configurations where
STRICT_KERNEL_RWX is *unavailable*.

Since this doesn't make much sense, and module RWX without kernel RWX
doesn't make much sense, having the same dependencies as kernel RWX
works around this problem.

Book3s/32 603 and 604 core processors are not able to write protect
kernel pages so do not set ARCH_HAS_STRICT_MODULE_RWX for Book3s/32.

[jpn: - predicate on !PPC_BOOK3S_604
      - make module_alloc() use PAGE_KERNEL protection]
