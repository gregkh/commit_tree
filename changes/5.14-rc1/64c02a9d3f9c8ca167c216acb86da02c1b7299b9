ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Fix union usage in mixer control callbacks

Fix mixer control callbacks to use the correct members of the struct
snd_ctl_elem_value. The use of value.integer and value.enumerated were
swapped in a few places.

Update scarlett2_mux_src_enum_ctl_put() to use min() instead of
clamp() as value.enumerated.item is unsigned.
