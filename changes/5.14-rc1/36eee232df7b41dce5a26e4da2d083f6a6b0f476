soundwire: cadence_master: always set CMD_ACCEPT

The Cadence IP can be configured in two different ways to deal with
CMD_IGNORED replies to broadcast commands. The CMD_ACCEPT bitfield
controls whether the command is discarded or if the IP proceeds with
the change (typically a bank switch or clock stop command).

The existing code seems to be inconsistent:
a) For some historical reason, we set this CMD_ACCEPT bitfield during
the initialization, but we don't during a resume from a clock-stoppped
state.
b) In addition, the loop used in the clock-stop sequence is quite
racy, it's possible that a device has lost sync but it's still tagged
as ATTACHED.
c) If somehow a Device loses sync and is unable to ack a broadcast
command, we do not have an error handling mechanism anyways. The IP
should go ahead and let the Device regain sync at a later time.

Make sure the CMD_ACCEPT bit is always set.
