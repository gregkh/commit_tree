dt-bindings: clock: clk-si5341: Add new attributes

Add new silabs,xaxb-ext-clk and silabs,iovdd-33 properties.

Changed vdd-supply on top-level node to optional since it is not actually
used by the driver.

Removed vdd-supply from output sub-nodes, as it was not supported by the
driver and it is not easily possible to support this in that location with
the kernel regulator infrastructure. Changed to have vddoX-supply
attributes for each output on the top-level device node.
