x86/fpu: Rename copy_fpregs_to_fpstate() to save_fpregs_to_fpstate()

A copy is guaranteed to leave the source intact, which is not the case when
FNSAVE is used as that reinitilizes the registers.

Save does not make such guarantees and it matches what this is about,
i.e. to save the state for a later restore.

Rename it to save_fpregs_to_fpstate().
