perf/x86/rapl: Use CPUID bit on AMD and Hygon parts

AMD and Hygon CPUs have a CPUID bit for RAPL.  Drop the fam17h suffix as
it is stale already.

Make use of this instead of a model check to work more nicely in virtual
environments where RAPL typically isn't available.

 [ bp: drop the ../cpu/powerflags.c hunk which is superfluous as the
   "rapl" bit name appears already in flags. ]
