Bluetooth: Add ncmd=0 recovery handling

During command status or command complete event, the controller may set
ncmd=0 indicating that it is not accepting any more commands. In such a
case, host holds off sending any more commands to the controller. If the
controller doesn't recover from such condition, host will wait forever,
until the user decides that the Bluetooth is broken and may power cycles
the Bluetooth.

This patch triggers the hardware error to reset the controller and
driver when it gets into such state as there is no other wat out.
