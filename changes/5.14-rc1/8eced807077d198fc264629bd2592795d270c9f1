scsi: lpfc: Reregister FPIN types if ELS_RDF is received from fabric controller

FC-LS-5 specifies that a received RDF implies a possible change to fabric
supported diagnostic functions. Endpoints are to re-perform the RDF
exchange with the fabric to enable possible new features or adapt to
changes in values.

This patch adds the logic to RDF receive to re-perform the RDF exchange
with the switch.
