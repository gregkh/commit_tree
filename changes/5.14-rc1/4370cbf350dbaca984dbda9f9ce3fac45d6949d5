ACPI: EC: trust DSDT GPE for certain HP laptop

On HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15-cx0xxx, the ECDT EC and DSDT EC share
the same port addresses but different GPEs. And the DSDT GPE is the
right one to use.

The current code duplicates DSDT EC with ECDT EC if the port addresses
are the same, and uses ECDT GPE as a result, which breaks this machine.

Introduce a new quirk for the HP laptop to trust the DSDT GPE,
and avoid duplicating even if the port addresses are the same.
