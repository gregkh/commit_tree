PM: runtime: Improve path in rpm_idle() when no callback

When pm_runtime_no_callbacks() has been called for a struct device to set
the dev->power.no_callbacks flag for it, it enables rpm_idle() to take a
slightly quicker path by assuming that a ->runtime_idle() callback would
have returned 0 to indicate success.

A device that does not have the dev->power.no_callbacks flag set for it,
may still be missing a corresponding ->runtime_idle() callback, in which
case the slower path in rpm_idle() is taken. Let's improve the behaviour
for this case, by aligning code to the quicker path.
