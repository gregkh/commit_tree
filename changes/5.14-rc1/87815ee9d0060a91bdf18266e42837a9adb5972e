cxl/pci: Add media provisioning required commands

Some of the commands have already been defined for the support of RAW
commands (to be blocked). Unlike their usage in the RAW interface, when
used through the supported interface, they will be coordinated and
marshalled along with other commands being issued by userspace and the
driver itself. That coordination will be added later.

The list of commands was determined based on the learnings from
libnvdimm and this list is provided directly from Dan.
