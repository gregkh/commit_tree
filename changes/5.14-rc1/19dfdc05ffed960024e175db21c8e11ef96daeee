kcsan: Remove reporting indirection

Now that we have separate kcsan_report_*() functions, we can factor the
distinct logic for each of the report cases out of kcsan_report(). While
this means each case has to handle mutual exclusion independently, this
minimizes the conditionality of code and makes it easier to read, and
will permit passing distinct bits of information to print_report() in
future.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
