RDMA/hns: Add a check to ensure integer mtu is positive

GCC may reports an running time assert error when a value calculated from
ib_mtu_enum_to_int() is using as 'val' in FIELD_PREDP:

include/linux/compiler_types.h:328:38: error: call to
'__compiletime_assert_1524' declared with attribute error: FIELD_PREP:
value too large for the field

So a check is added about whether integer mtu from ib_mtu_enum_to_int() is
negative to avoid this warning.
