mm/zbud: reuse unbuddied[0] as buddied in zbud_pool

Patch series "Cleanups for zbud", v2.

This series contains just cleanups to save some possible memory in
zbud_pool and avoid exporting any unneeded zbud API.  More details can be
found in the respective changelogs

This patch (of 2):

Since commit 9d8c5b5284e4 ("mm: zbud: fix condition check on allocation
size"), zbud_pool.unbuddied[0] is always unused.  We can reuse it as
buddied field to save some possible memory.
