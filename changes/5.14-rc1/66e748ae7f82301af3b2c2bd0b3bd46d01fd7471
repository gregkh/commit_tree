iio: temp: mlx90614: Handle failure in pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Converts from using pm_runtime_get_sync() with no error handling over
to pm_runtime_resume_and_get() which will ensure we don't end up
holding a reference.  Ensure this error return is then handled at
calls to mlx90614_power_get(). These are all direct returns.
