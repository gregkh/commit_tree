drm/amd/pm: Add ASIC independent throttle bits

Add new defines for thermal throttle status bits which are ASIC
independent. This bit field will be visible to userspace via
gpu_metrics alongside the previous ASIC dependent bit fields. Seperated
into four types: power throttlers (16 bits), current throttlers (16
bits), temperature (24 bits), other (8 bits).
