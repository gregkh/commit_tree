net: dsa: remove cross-chip support from the MRP notifiers

With MRP hardware assist being supported only by the ocelot switch
family, which by design does not support cross-chip bridging, the
current match functions are at best a guess and have not been confirmed
in any way to do anything relevant in a multi-switch topology.

Drop the code and make the notifiers match only on the targeted switch
port.
