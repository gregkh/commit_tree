RDMA/rxe: Move local ops to subroutine

Simplify rxe_requester() by moving the local operations to a subroutine.
Add an error return for illegal send WR opcode.  Moved next_index ahead of
rxe_run_task which fixed a small bug where work completions were delayed
until after the next wqe which was not the intended behavior.  Let errors
return their own WC status. Previously all errors were reported as
protection errors which was incorrect. Changed the return of errors from
rxe_do_local_ops() to err: which causes an immediate completion.  Without
this an error on a last WR may get lost. Changed fill_packet() to
finish_packet() which is more accurate.
