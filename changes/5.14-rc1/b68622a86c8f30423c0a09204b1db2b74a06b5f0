locking/atomic: microblaze: use asm-generic exclusively

Microblaze provides its own implementation of atomic_dec_if_positive(),
but nothing else. For a while now, the conditional inc/dec ops have been
optional, and the core code will provide generic implementations using
the code templates in scripts/atomic/fallbacks/.

For simplicity, and for consistency with the other conditional atomic
ops, let's drop the microblaze implementation of
atomic_dec_if_positive(), and use the generic implementation.

With that, we can also drop the local asm/atomic.h and asm/cmpxchg.h
headers, as asm-generic/atomic.h is mandatory-y, and we can pull in
asm-generic/cmpxchg.h via generic-y. This matches what nios2 and nds32
do today.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
