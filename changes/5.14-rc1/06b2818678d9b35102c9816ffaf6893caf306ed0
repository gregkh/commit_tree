arm64: dts: rockchip: Re-add regulator-boot-on, regulator-always-on for vdd_gpu on rk3399-roc-pc

This might be a limitation of either the current panfrost driver
devfreq implementation or how the gpu is implemented in RK3399 SoC.
The gpu regulator must never get disabled or the registers get
(randomly?) inaccessable by the driver. (see all other RK3399 boards)
