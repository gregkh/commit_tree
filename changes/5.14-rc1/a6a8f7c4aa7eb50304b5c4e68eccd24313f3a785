powerpc/8xx: add support for huge pages on VMAP and VMALLOC

powerpc 8xx has 4 page sizes:
- 4k
- 16k
- 512k
- 8M

At the time being, vmalloc and vmap only support huge pages which are leaf
at PMD level.

Here the PMD level is 4M, it doesn't correspond to any supported page
size.

For now, implement use of 16k and 512k pages which is done at PTE level.

Support of 8M pages will be implemented later, it requires vmalloc to
support hugepd tables.
