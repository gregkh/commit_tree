i2c: core: Make debug message even more debuggish

One may notice that dev_printk(KERN_DEBUG ...) is *not* an equivalent
to dev_dbg(). It will be printed whenever loglevel is high enough.
And currently it will be the only message in the I²C core in some
configurations that got printed under above conditions.

Moving to dev_dbg() will hide it in the configurations where Dynamic Debug
is enabled and hence align with all other debug messages in the I²C core..
