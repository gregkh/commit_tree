perf header: Support HYBRID_CPU_PMU_CAPS feature

Perf has supported the CPU_PMU_CAPS feature to display a list of CPU PMU
capabilities. But on a hybrid platform, it may have several CPU PMUs (such
as "cpu_core" and "cpu_atom"). The CPU_PMU_CAPS feature is hard to extend
to support multiple CPU PMUs well if it needs to be compatible for the case
of old perf data file + new perf tool.

So for better compatibility we now create a new feature HYBRID_CPU_PMU_CAPS
in the header.

For the perf.data generated on hybrid platform,

  root@otcpl-adl-s-2:~# perf report --header-only -I

  # cpu_core pmu capabilities: branches=32, max_precise=3, pmu_name=alderlake_hybrid
  # cpu_atom pmu capabilities: branches=32, max_precise=3, pmu_name=alderlake_hybrid
  # missing features: TRACING_DATA BRANCH_STACK GROUP_DESC AUXTRACE STAT CLOCKID DIR_FORMAT COMPRESSED CPU_PMU_CAPS CLOCK_DATA

For the perf.data generated on non-hybrid platform

  root@kbl-ppc:~# perf report --header-only -I

  # cpu pmu capabilities: branches=32, max_precise=3, pmu_name=skylake
  # missing features: TRACING_DATA BRANCH_STACK GROUP_DESC AUXTRACE STAT CLOCKID DIR_FORMAT COMPRESSED CLOCK_DATA HYBRID_TOPOLOGY HYBRID_CPU_PMU_CAPS
