nfsd: fix NULL dereference in nfs3svc_encode_getaclres

In error cases the dentry may be NULL.

Before 20798dfe249a, the encoder also checked dentry and
d_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill to me--zero
status should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry.

This isn't the first time we've seen an error-case NULL dereference
hidden in the initialization of a local variable in an xdr encoder.  But
I went back through the other recent rewrites and didn't spot any
similar bugs.
