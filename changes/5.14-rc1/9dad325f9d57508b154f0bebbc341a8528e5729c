iwlwifi: support loading the reduced power table from UEFI

This new feature allows OEMs to set a special reduced power table in a
UEFI variable, which we use to tell the firmware to change the TX
power tables.

Read the variable and store it in a dram block to pass it to the
firmware.  We do this as part of the PNVM loading flow.
