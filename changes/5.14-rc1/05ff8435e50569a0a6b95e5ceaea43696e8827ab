net/sched: cls_api: increase max_reclassify_loop

modern userspace applications, like OVN, can configure the TC datapath to
"recirculate" packets several times. If more than 4 "recirculation" rules
are configured, packets can be dropped by __tcf_classify().
Changing the maximum number of reclassifications (from 4 to 16) should be
sufficient to prevent drops in most use cases, and guard against loops at
the same time.
