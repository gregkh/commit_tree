regulator: fan53555: add tcs4526

For rk3399pro boards the tcs4526 regulator supports the vdd_gpu
regulator. The tcs4526 regulator has a chip id of <0>.
Add the compatibile tcs,tcs4526

without this patch, the dmesg output is:
  fan53555-regulator 0-0010: Chip ID 0 not supported!
  fan53555-regulator 0-0010: Failed to setup device!
  fan53555-regulator: probe of 0-0010 failed with error -22
with this patch, the dmesg output is:
  vdd_gpu: supplied by vcc5v0_sys

The regulators are described as:
- Dedicated power management IC TCS4525
- Lithium battery protection chip TCS4526

This has been tested with a Radxa Rock Pi N10.
