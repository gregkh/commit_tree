drm/i915: Reorder skl+ scaler vs. plane updates

When scanning out NV12 if we at any time have the plane enabled
while the scaler is disabled we get a pretty catastrophic
underrun.

Let's reorder the operations so that we try to avoid that happening
even if our vblank evade fails and the scaler enable/disable and
the plane enable/disable get latched during two diffent frames.

This takes care of the most common cases. I suppose there is still
at least a theoretical possibility of hitting this if one plane
takes the scaler away from another plane before the second plane
had a chance to set up another scaler for its use. But that
is starting to get a bit complicated, especially since the plane
commit order already has to be carefully sequenced to avoid any
dbuf overlaps. So plugging this 100% may prove somewhat hard...
