drm/amdkfd: enable subsequent retry fault

After draining the stale retry fault, or failed to validate the range
to recover, have to remove the fault address from fault filter ring, to
be able to handle subsequent retry interrupt on same address. Otherwise
the retry fault will not be processed to recover until timeout passed.
