vdpa/mlx5: Fix umem sizes assignments on VQ create

Fix copy paste bug assigning umem1 size to umem2 and umem3. The issue
was discovered when trying to use a 1:1 MR that covers the entire
address space where firmware complained that provided sizes are not
large enough. 1:1 MRs are required to support virtio_vdpa.
