x86/fpu: Rename xfeatures_mask_user() to xfeatures_mask_uabi()

Rename it so it's clear that this is about user ABI features which can
differ from the feature set which the kernel saves and restores because the
kernel handles e.g. PKRU differently. But the user ABI (ptrace, signal
frame) expects it to be there.
