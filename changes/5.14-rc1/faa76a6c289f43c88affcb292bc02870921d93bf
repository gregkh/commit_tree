tracing: Simplify the max length test when using the filtering temp buffer

When filtering trace events, a temp buffer is used because the extra copy
from the temp buffer into the ring buffer is still faster than the direct
write into the ring buffer followed by a discard if the filter does not
match.

But the data that can be stored in the temp buffer is a PAGE_SIZE minus the
ring buffer event header. The calculation of that header size is complex,
but using the helper macro "struct_size()" can simplify it.
