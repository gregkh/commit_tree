drm/i915: Don't free shared locks while shared

We are currently sharing the VM reservation locks across a number of
gem objects with page-table memory. Since TTM will individiualize the
reservation locks when freeing objects, including accessing the shared
locks, make sure that the shared locks are not freed until that is done.
For PPGTT we add an additional refcount, for GGTT we take additional
measures to make sure objects sharing the GGTT reservation lock are
freed at GGTT takedown
