ice: report hash type such as L2/L3/L4

The hardware is reporting the type of the hash used for RSS
as a PTYPE field in the receive descriptor. Use this value to set
the skb packet hash type by extending the hash type table to
cover all 10-bits of possible values (requiring some variables
to be changed from u8 to u16), and then use that table to convert
to one of the possible values in enum pkt_hash_types.

While we're here, remove the unused ptype struct value, which
makes table init easier for the zero entries, and use ranged
initializer to remove a bunch of code (works with gcc and clang).

Without this change, the kernel will recalculate the hash in software,
which can consume extra CPU cycles.
