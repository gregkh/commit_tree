sctp: extract sctp_v4_err_handle function from sctp_v4_err

This patch is to extract sctp_v4_err_handle() from sctp_v4_err() to
only handle the icmp err after the sock lookup, and it also makes
the code clearer.

sctp_v4_err_handle() will be used in sctp over udp's err handling
in the following patch.
