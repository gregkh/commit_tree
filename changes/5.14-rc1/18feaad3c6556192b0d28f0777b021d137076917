KVM: x86/mmu: Drop smep_andnot_wp check from "uses NX" for shadow MMUs

Drop the smep_andnot_wp role check from the "uses NX" calculation now
that all non-nested shadow MMUs treat NX as used via the !TDP check.

The shadow MMU for nested NPT, which shares the helper, does not need to
deal with SMEP (or WP) as NPT walks are always "user" accesses and WP is
explicitly noted as being ignored:

  Table walks for guest page tables are always treated as user writes at
  the nested page table level.

  A table walk for the guest page itself is always treated as a user
  access at the nested page table level

  The host hCR0.WP bit is ignored under nested paging.
