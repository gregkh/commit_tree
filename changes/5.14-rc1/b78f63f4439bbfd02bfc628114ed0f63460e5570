ARM: 9088/1: Split KERNEL_OFFSET from PAGE_OFFSET

We want to be able to compile the kernel into an address different
from PAGE_OFFSET (start of lowmem) + TEXT_OFFSET, so start to pry
apart the address of where the kernel is located from the address
where the lowmem is located by defining and using KERNEL_OFFSET in
a few key places.
