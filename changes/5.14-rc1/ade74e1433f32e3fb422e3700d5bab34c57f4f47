KVM: x86/mmu: Grab nx_lpage_splits as an unsigned long before division

Snapshot kvm->stats.nx_lpage_splits into a local unsigned long to avoid
64-bit division on 32-bit kernels.  Casting to an unsigned long is safe
because the maximum number of shadow pages, n_max_mmu_pages, is also an
unsigned long, i.e. KVM will start recycling shadow pages before the
number of splits can exceed a 32-bit value.

  ERROR: modpost: "__udivdi3" [arch/x86/kvm/kvm.ko] undefined!
