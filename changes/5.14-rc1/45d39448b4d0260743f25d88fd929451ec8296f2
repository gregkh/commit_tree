usb: dwc3: support 64 bit DMA in platform driver

Currently, the dwc3 platform driver does not explicitly ask for
a DMA mask. This makes it fall back to the default 32-bit mask which
breaks the driver on systems that only have RAM starting above the
first 4G like the Apple M1 SoC.

Fix this by calling dma_set_mask_and_coherent with a 64bit mask.
