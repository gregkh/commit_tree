w1: ds2438: support for writing to offset register

Added a sysfs entry to support writing to the offset register on page1.
This register is used to calibrate the chip canceling offset errors in the
current ADC. This means that, over time, reading the IAD register will not
return the correct current measurement, it will have an offset. Writing to
the offset register if the two's complement of the current register while
passing zero current to the load will calibrate the measurements. This
change was tested on real hardware and it was able to calibrate the chip
correctly.
