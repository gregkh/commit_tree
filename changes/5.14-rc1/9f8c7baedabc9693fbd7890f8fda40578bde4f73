ACPICA: Add PRMT module header to facilitate parsing

ACPICA commit bd46cb07e614fd85ea69e54c1f6f0ae0a5fb20ab

This structure is used in to parse PRMT in other Operating Systems
that relies on using subtable headers in order to parse ACPI tables.
Although the PRMT doesn't have "subtables" it has a list of module
information structures that act as subtables.
