media: mc-request.c: allow object_bind in QUEUED state

If a request was queued without a control handler object, and
a control handler object is then created and bound to the request
when copying controls on request completion, then a WARN_ON in
mc-request.c is triggered since at that time the request is in
state QUEUED, and not UPDATING.

But this is too strict, and in this case it must also allow
binding objects when in state QUEUED.

This patch was unfortunately lost when the "always copy the controls
on completion" patch was posted, it should have been part of that
commit.
