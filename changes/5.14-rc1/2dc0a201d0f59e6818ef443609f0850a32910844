PCI: iproc: Support multi-MSI only on uniprocessor kernel

The interrupt affinity scheme used by this driver is incompatible with
multi-MSI as it implies moving the doorbell address to that of another MSI
group.  This isn't possible for multi-MSI, as all the MSIs must have the
same doorbell address. As such it is restricted to systems with a single
CPU.
