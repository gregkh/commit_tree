tpm: add longer timeout for TPM2_CC_VERIFY_SIGNATURE

While running a TPM2_CC_VERIFY_SIGNATURE operation with RSA 3072-bit
keys the TPM driver fails with the following error:

"kernel: [ 2416.187522] tpm tpm0: Operation Timed out"

Since the TPM PC Client specification does not specify a number for
verify signature operation timeout, and the duration of
TPM2_CC_VERIFY_SIGNATURE with RSA 3072-bit keys exceeds the current timeout
of TPM_LONG (2 seconds), it is preferable to pick the longest timeout
possible.

Therefore, set the duration for TPM2_CC_VERIFY_SIGNATUE to TPM_LONG_LONG
(5 minutes).
