ntfs_copy_from_user_iter(): don't bother with copying iov_iter

Advance the original, let the caller revert if it needs to.
Don't mess with iov_iter_single_seg_count() in the caller -
if we got a (non-zero) short copy, use the amount actually
copied for the next pass, limit it to "up to the end
of page" if nothing got copied at all.

Originally fault-in only read the first iovec; back then it used
to make sense to limit to the just one iovec for the pass after
short copy.  These days it's no long true.
