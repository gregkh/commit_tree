iio: si1133: fix format string warnings

clang complains about multiple instances of printing an integer
using the %hhx format string:

drivers/iio/light/si1133.c:982:4: error: format specifies type 'unsigned char' but the argument has type 'unsigned int' [-Werror,-Wformat]
                 part_id, rev_id, mfr_id);
                 ^~~~~~~

Print them as a normal integer instead, leaving the "#02"
length modifier.

Use the 0x02x form as the length specifier when used with # includes
the 0x prefix and is very unlikely to be what was intended by the author.
