x86/cstate: Allow ACPI C1 FFH MWAIT use on Hygon systems

Hygon systems support the MONITOR/MWAIT instructions and these can be
used for ACPI C1 in the same way as on AMD and Intel systems.

The BIOS declares a C1 state in _CST to use FFH and CPUID_Fn00000005_EDX
is non-zero on Hygon systems.

Allow ffh_cstate_init() to succeed on Hygon systems to default using FFH
MWAIT instead of HALT for ACPI C1.
