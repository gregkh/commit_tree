media: gspca/sunplus: fix zero-length control requests

The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
implementation.

Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
will now trigger a warning.

Fix the single zero-length control request which was using the
read-register helper, and update the helper so that zero-length reads
fail with an error message instead.
