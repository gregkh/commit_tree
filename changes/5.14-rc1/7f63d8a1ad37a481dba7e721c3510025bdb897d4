drm/amd/display: update DCN to use new surface programming

[Why]
The split pipe config is updated due to antoher stream bandwidth
validataion. Driver doesn't reprogram the split pipe config
to signle pipe cause SW use signel pipe but HW still use pipe split.

[How]
track global updates and update any hw that isn't
related to current stream being updated.
