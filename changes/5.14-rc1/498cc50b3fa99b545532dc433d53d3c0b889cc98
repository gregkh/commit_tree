clk: hisilicon: hi3559a: Drop __init markings everywhere

This driver is a platform driver. The probe function can be called after
kernel init, and try to reference kernel memory that has been freed.
Drop the __init markings everywhere here to avoid referencing initdata
from non-init code. Fixes modpost warnings.
