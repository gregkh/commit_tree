CIFS: Clarify SMB1 code for SetFileSize

Coverity also complains about the way we calculate the offset
(starting from the address of a 4 byte array within the header
structure rather than from the beginning of the struct plus
4 bytes) for setting the file size using SMB1. This changeset
doesn't change the address but makes it slightly clearer.
