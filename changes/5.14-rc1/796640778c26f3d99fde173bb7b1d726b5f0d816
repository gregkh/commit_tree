net: hns3: support RXD advanced layout

Currently, the driver gets packet type by parsing the
L3_ID/L4_ID/OL3_ID/OL4_ID from RX descriptor, it's
time-consuming.

Now some new devices support RXD advanced layout, which combines
previous OL3_ID/OL4_ID to 8bit ptype field, so the driver gets
packet type by looking up only one table, and L3_ID/L4_ID become
reserved fields.

Considering compatibility, the firmware will report capability of
RXD advanced layout, the driver will identify and enable it by
default. This patch provides basic function: identify and enable
the RXD advanced layout, and refactor out hns3_rx_checksum() by
using ptype table to handle RX checksum if supported.
