drm/amdgpu: correct psp ucode arrary start address

For ASICs that need to load sys_drv_aux and sos_aux,
the sys_start_addr is not the start address of psp
ucode array because the sys_drv_aux and sos_aux actaully
located at the end of the ucode array, instead, the
psp ucode arrary start address should be sos_hdr +
sos_hdr_offset.
