bpf: Add documentation for libbpf including API autogen

This patch is meant to start the initiative to document libbpf.
It includes .rst files which are text documentation describing building,
API naming convention, as well as an index to generated API documentation.

In this approach the generated API documentation is enabled by the kernels
existing kernel documentation system which uses sphinx. The resulting docs
would then be synced to kernel.org/doc

You can test this by running `make htmldocs` and serving the html in
Documentation/output. Since libbpf does not yet have comments in kernel
doc format, see kernel.org/doc/html/latest/doc-guide/kernel-doc.html for
an example so you can test this.

The advantage of this approach is to use the existing sphinx
infrastructure that the kernel has, and have libbpf docs in
the same place as everything else.

The current plan is to have the libbpf mirror sync the generated docs
and version them based on the libbpf releases which are cut on github.

This patch includes the addition of libbpf_api.rst which pulls comment
documentation from header files in libbpf under tools/lib/bpf/. The comment
docs would be of the standard kernel doc format.
