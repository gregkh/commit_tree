tracing: Remove redundant assignment to event_var

Variable event_var is set to 'ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)', but this value
is never read as it is overwritten or not used later on, hence
it is a redundant assignment and can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

kernel/trace/trace_events_hist.c:2437:21: warning: Value stored to
'event_var' during its initialization is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
