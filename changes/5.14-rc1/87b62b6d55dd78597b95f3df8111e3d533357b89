media: atmel: atmel-isc: add SUB422 and SUB420 to register offsets

The SUB submodules are a part of the atmel-isc pipeline, and stand for
Subsampling. They are used to subsample the original YUV 4:4:4 pixel ratio
aspect to either 4:2:2 or 4:2:0.
Add sub420 and sub422 to the reg offsets struct.
This will allow different products to have a different reg offset for these
particular modules.
