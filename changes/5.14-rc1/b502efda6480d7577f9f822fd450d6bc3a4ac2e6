arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add CoachZ rev3

CoachZ rev3 uses a 100k NTC thermistor for the charger temperatures,
instead of the 47k NTC that is stuffed in earlier revisions. Add .dts
files for rev3.

The 47k NTC currently isn't supported by the PM6150 ADC driver.
Disable the charger thermal zone for rev1 and rev2 to avoid the use
of bogus temperature values.

This also gets rid of the explicit DT files for rev2 and handles
rev2 in the rev1 .dts instead. There was some back and forth
downstream involving the 'dmic_clk_en' pin, after that was sorted
out the DT for rev1 and rev2 is the same.
