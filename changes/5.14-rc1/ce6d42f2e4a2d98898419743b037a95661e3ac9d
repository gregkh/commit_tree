mm: add vma_lookup(), update find_vma_intersection() comments

Patch series "mm: Add vma_lookup()", v2.

Many places in the kernel use find_vma() to get a vma and then check the
start address of the vma to ensure the next vma was not returned.

Other places use the find_vma_intersection() call with add, addr + 1 as
the range; looking for just the vma at a specific address.

The third use of find_vma() is by developers who do not know that the
function starts searching at the provided address upwards for the next
vma.  This results in a bug that is often overlooked for a long time.

Adding the new vma_lookup() function will allow for cleaner code by
removing the find_vma() calls which check limits, making
find_vma_intersection() calls of a single address to be shorter, and
potentially reduce the incorrect uses of find_vma().

potentially reduce the incorrect uses of find_vma().

Also change find_vma_intersection() comments and declaration to be of the
correct length and add kernel documentation style comment.
