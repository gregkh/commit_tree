drm/radeon/si_dpm: Fix SMU power state load

Create new structure SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE_SINGLE, as initialState.levels
and ACPIState.levels are never actually used as flexible arrays. Those
arrays can be used as simple objects of type
SISLANDS_SMC_HW_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL, instead.

Currently, the code fails because flexible array _levels_ in
struct SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE doesn't allow for code that access
the first element of initialState.levels and ACPIState.levels
arrays:

4353         table->initialState.levels[0].mclk.vDLL_CNTL =
4354                 cpu_to_be32(si_pi->clock_registers.dll_cntl);
...
4555         table->ACPIState.levels[0].mclk.vDLL_CNTL =
4556                 cpu_to_be32(dll_cntl);

because such element cannot exist without previously allocating
any dynamic memory for it (which never actually happens).

That's why struct SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE should only be used as type
for object driverState and new struct SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE_SINGLE is
created as type for objects initialState, ACPIState and ULVState.

Also, with the change from one-element array to flexible-array member
in commit 96e27e8d919e ("drm/radeon/si_dpm: Replace one-element array
with flexible-array in struct SISLANDS_SMC_SWSTATE"), the size of
dpmLevels in struct SISLANDS_SMC_STATETABLE should be fixed to be
SISLANDS_MAX_SMC_PERFORMANCE_LEVELS_PER_SWSTATE instead of
SISLANDS_MAX_SMC_PERFORMANCE_LEVELS_PER_SWSTATE - 1.
