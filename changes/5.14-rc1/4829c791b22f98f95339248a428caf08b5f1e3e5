percpu: initialize best_upa variable

Tom reported this finding from clang 10's static analysis [1].

Due to the way the code is written, it will always see a successful loop
iteration. Instead of setting an initial value, check that it was set
instead with BUG_ON() because 0 units per allocation is bogus.
