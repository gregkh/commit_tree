MIPS: ingenic: gcw0: Set codec to cap-less mode for FM radio

When using the FM radio, we must not have capacitors on the headphones
line, since it is used as the antenna.

The "FM Radio" widget is removed so that the cap-less mode can be
enabled dynamically through DAPM when the line input is used.
This widget was useless anyway.
