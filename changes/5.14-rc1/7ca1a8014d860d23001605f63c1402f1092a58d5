ACPI: tables: PPTT: Populate cache-id if provided by firmware

ACPI 6.4 adds a 'cache id' to the PPTT Cache Type Structure.

Copy this property across into the cacheinfo leaf when it was
provided by firmware.

This value gets exposed to userspace as:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache/index*/id.

See the "Cache IDs" section of Documentation/x86/resctrl.rst.
