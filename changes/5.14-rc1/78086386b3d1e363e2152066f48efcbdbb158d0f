clk: tegra: Don't allow zero clock rate for PLLs

Zero clock rate doesn't make sense for PLLs and tegra-clk driver enters
into infinite loop on trying to calculate PLL parameters for zero rate.
Make code to error out if requested rate is zero.

Originally this trouble was found by Robert Yang while he was trying to
bring up upstream kernel on Samsung Galaxy Tab, which happened due to a
bug in Tegra DRM driver that erroneously sets PLL rate to zero. This
issues came over again recently during of kernel bring up on ASUS TF700T.
