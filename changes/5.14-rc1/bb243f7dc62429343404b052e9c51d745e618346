mm/swapfile: move get_swap_page_of_type() under CONFIG_HIBERNATION

Patch series "Cleanups for swap", v2.

This series contains just cleanups to remove some unused variables, delete
meaningless forward declarations and so on.  More details can be found in
the respective changelogs.

This patch (of 4):

We should move get_swap_page_of_type() under CONFIG_HIBERNATION since the
only caller of this function is now suspend routine.
