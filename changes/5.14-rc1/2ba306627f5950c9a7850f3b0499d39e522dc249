net: hns3: add support for modify VLAN filter state

Previously, with hardware limitation, the port VLAN filter are
effective for both PF and its VFs simultaneously, so a single
function is not able to enable/disable separately, and the VLAN
filter state is default enabled. Now some device supports each
function to bypass port VLAN filter, then each function can
switch VLAN filter separately. Add capability flag to check
whether the device supports modify VLAN filter state. If flag
on, user will be able to modify the VLAN filter state by ethtool
-K.

Furtherly, the default VLAN filter state is also changed
according to whether non-zero VLAN used. Then the device can
receive packet with any VLAN tag if only VLAN 0 used.

The function hclge_need_enable_vport_vlan_filter() is used to
help implement above changes. And the VLAN filter handle for
promisc mode can also be simplified by this function.
