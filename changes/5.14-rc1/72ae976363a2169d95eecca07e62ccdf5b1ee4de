dt-bindings: arm: rockchip: add more compatible strings to pmu.yaml

The compatible strings below are already in use in the Rockchip
dtsi files, but were somehow never added to a document, so add

"rockchip,px30-pmu", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
"rockchip,rk3288-pmu", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
"rockchip,rk3399-pmu", "syscon", "simple-mfd"

for pmu nodes to pmu.yaml.
