clk: actions: Fix AHPPREDIV-H-AHB clock chain on Owl S500 SoC

There are a few issues with the setup of the Actions Semi Owl S500 SoC's
clock chain involving AHPPREDIV, H and AHB clocks:

* AHBPREDIV clock is defined as a muxer only, although it also acts as
  a divider.
* H clock is using a wrong divider register offset
* AHB is defined as a multi-rate factor clock, but it is actually just
  a fixed pass clock.

Let's provide the following fixes:

* Change AHBPREDIV clock to an ungated OWL_COMP_DIV definition.
* Use the correct register shift value in the OWL_DIVIDER definition
  for H clock
* Drop the unneeded 'ahb_factor_table[]' and change AHB clock to an
  ungated OWL_COMP_FIXED_FACTOR definition.
