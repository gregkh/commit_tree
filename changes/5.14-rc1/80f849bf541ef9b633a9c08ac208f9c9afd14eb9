um: implement flush_cache_vmap/flush_cache_vunmap

vmalloc() heavy workloads in UML are extremely slow, due to
flushing the entire kernel VM space (flush_tlb_kernel_vm())
on the first segfault.

Implement flush_cache_vmap() to avoid that, and while at it
also add flush_cache_vunmap() since it's trivial.

This speeds up my vmalloc() heavy test of copying files out
from /sys/kernel/debug/gcov/ by 30x (from 30s to 1s.)
