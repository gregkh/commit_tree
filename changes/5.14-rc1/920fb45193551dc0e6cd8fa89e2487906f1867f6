gve: Make gve_rx_slot_page_info.page_offset an absolute offset

Using `page_offset` like a boolean means a page may only be split into
two sections. With page sizes larger than 4k, this can be very wasteful.
Future commits in this patchset use `struct gve_rx_slot_page_info` in a
way which supports a fixed buffer size and a variable page size.
