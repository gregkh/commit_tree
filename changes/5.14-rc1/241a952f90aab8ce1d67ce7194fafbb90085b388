dt-bindings: touchscreen: resistive-adc-touch: add support for z1 and z2 channels

For pressure calculation based on plates resistance we need some additional
properties:
- z1 and z2 channels with additional measurements between plates
- actual resistance of the touchscreen. Currently we use only
  X-resistance.
