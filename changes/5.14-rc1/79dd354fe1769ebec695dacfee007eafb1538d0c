pwm: pca9685: Add error messages for failed regmap calls

Regmap operations can fail if the underlying subsystem is not working
properly (e.g. hogged I2C bus, etc.)
As this is useful information for the user, print an error message if it
happens.
Let probe fail if the first regmap_read or the first regmap_write fails.
