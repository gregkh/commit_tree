ALSA: bebob: Fix bit flag quirk constants

The quirking bit-flags are currently set as contiguous integer enum values
and so currently SND_BEBOB_QUIRK_INITIAL_DISCONTINUOUS_DBC is zero and so
he quirking never getting set or tested correctly for this quirk. Fix this
by setting the quirking constants as shifted bit values.
