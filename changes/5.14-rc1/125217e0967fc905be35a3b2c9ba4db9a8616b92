i40e: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having a
dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in struct
i40e_qvlist_info instead of one-element array, and use the struct_size()
helper.
