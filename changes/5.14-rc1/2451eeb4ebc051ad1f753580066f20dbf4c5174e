dt-bindings: dmaengine: Remove SHDMA Device Tree bindings

Remove the Renesas SHDMA Device Tree bindings, as they are unused.
The DMA multiplexer node and one DMA controller instance were added to
the R-Mobile APE6 .dtsi file, but DMA support was never fully enabled,
cfr. commit a19788612f51b787 ("dmaengine: sh: Remove R-Mobile APE6
support").

Note that the mux idea was dropped when implementing support for DMA on
R-Car Gen2, cfr. renesas,rcar-dmac.yaml.
