iommu/arm-smmu: tegra: Detect number of instances at runtime

Parse the reg property in device tree and detect the number of instances
represented by a device tree node. This is subsequently needed in order
to support single-instance SMMUs with the Tegra implementation because
additional programming is needed to properly configure the SID override
registers in the memory controller.
