bpf: Introduce bpf_sys_bpf() helper and program type.

Add placeholders for bpf_sys_bpf() helper and new program type.
Make sure to check that expected_attach_type is zero for future extensibility.
Allow tracing helper functions to be used in this program type, since they will
only execute from user context via bpf_prog_test_run.
