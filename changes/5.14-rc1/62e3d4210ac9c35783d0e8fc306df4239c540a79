powerpc/bpf: Write protect JIT code

Add the necessary call to bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro() to remove write and
add exec permissions to the JIT image after it has finished being
written.

Without CONFIG_STRICT_MODULE_RWX the image will be writable and
executable until the call to bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro().
