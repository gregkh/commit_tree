ACPI: tables: Add custom DSDT file as makefile prerequisite

A custom DSDT file is mostly used during development or debugging,
and in that case it is quite likely to want to rebuild the kernel
after changing ONLY the content of the DSDT.

This patch adds the custom DSDT as a prerequisite to tables.o
to ensure a rebuild if the DSDT file is updated. Make will merge
the prerequisites from multiple rules for the same target.
