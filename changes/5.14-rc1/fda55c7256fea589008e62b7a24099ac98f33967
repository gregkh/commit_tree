dt-bindings: soc: ti: Convert ti,sci-pm-domain to json schema

Convert the ti,sci-pm-domain to json schema for better checks and
documentation.

Differences being:
 - Drop consumer example as they are documented in the corresponding
   bindings themselves.
 - Drop phandle description for reset consumer or cell definition as it
   is redundant.
