iio: light: si1145: Drop use of %hhx format specifier.

Since:
commit cbacb5ab0aa0 ("docs: printk-formats: Stop encouraging use of
unnecessary %h[xudi] and %hh[xudi]")
use of these format strings has been discouraged.

As there are only a few such instances in IIO, this is part of a
series clearing them out so they don't get copied into new drivers.

Use the 0x02x form as the length specifier when used with # includes
the 0x prefix and is very unlikely to be what was intended by the author.
