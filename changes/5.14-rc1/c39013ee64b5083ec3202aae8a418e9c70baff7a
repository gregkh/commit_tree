kbuild: clean up ${quiet} checks in shell scripts

There were efforts to make 'make -s' really silent when it is a
warning-free build.

The conventional way was to let a shell script check ${quiet}, and if
it is 'silent_', suppress the stdout by itself.

With the previous commit, the 'cmd' takes care of it now. The 'cmd' is
also invoked from if_changed, if_changed_dep, and if_changed_rule.

You can omit ${quiet} checks in shell scripts when they are invoked
from the 'cmd' macro.
