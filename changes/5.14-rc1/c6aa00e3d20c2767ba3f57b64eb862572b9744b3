fs: dlm: cancel work sync othercon

These rx tx flags arguments are for signaling close_connection() from
which worker they are called. Obviously the receive worker cannot cancel
itself and vice versa for swork. For the othercon the receive worker
should only be used, however to avoid deadlocks we should pass the same
flags as the original close_connection() was called.
