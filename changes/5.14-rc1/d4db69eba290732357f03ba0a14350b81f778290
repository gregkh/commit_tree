regulator: fan53555: fix TCS4525 voltage calulation

The TCS4525 has 128 voltage steps. With the calculation set to 127 the
most significant bit is disregarded which leads to a miscalculation of
the voltage by about 200mv.

Fix the calculation to end deadlock on the rk3566-quartz64 which uses
this as the cpu regulator.
