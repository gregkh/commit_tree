KVM: x86: Drop .post_leave_smm(), i.e. the manual post-RSM MMU reset

Drop the .post_leave_smm() emulator callback, which at this point is just
a wrapper to kvm_mmu_reset_context().  The manual context reset is
unnecessary, because unlike enter_smm() which calls vendor MSR/CR helpers
directly, em_rsm() bounces through the KVM helpers, e.g. kvm_set_cr4(),
which are responsible for processing side effects.  em_rsm() is already
subtly relying on this behavior as it doesn't manually do
kvm_update_cpuid_runtime(), e.g. to recognize CR4.OSXSAVE changes.
