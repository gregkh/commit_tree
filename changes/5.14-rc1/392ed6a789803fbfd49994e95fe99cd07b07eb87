ACPI: Do not singal PRM support if not enabled

If the OS confirms PRM (Platform Runtime Mechanism) support through
the \_SB._OSC PRM bit, the BIOS may start relying on the presence of
PRM support in the OS, so prevent the PRM bit from being set in the
\_SB._OSC capabilities bitmask when PRM support is not built in so
as to avoid confusing the BIOS in that case.
