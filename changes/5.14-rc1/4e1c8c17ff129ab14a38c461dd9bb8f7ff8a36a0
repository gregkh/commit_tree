scsi: aic94xx: Fix fall-through warning for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix a
warning by explicitly adding a fallthrough; statement.

Notice that this seems to be a Duff device for performance[1]. So,
although the code looks a bit _funny_, I didn't want to refactor
or modify it beyond merely adding a fallthrough marking, which
might be the least disruptive way to fix this issue.
