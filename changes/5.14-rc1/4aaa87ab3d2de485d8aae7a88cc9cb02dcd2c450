arm64/mm: Drop SECTION_[SHIFT|SIZE|MASK]

SECTION_[SHIFT|SIZE|MASK] are essentially PMD_[SHIFT|SIZE|MASK]. But these
create confusion being similar to generic sparsemem memory sections, which
are derived from SECTION_SIZE_BITS. Section references have always implied
PMD level block mapping. Instead just use all PMD level macros which would
make it explicit and also remove confusion with sparsmem memory sections.
