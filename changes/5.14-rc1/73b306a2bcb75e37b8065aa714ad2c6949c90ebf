scsi: bnx2fc: Remove meaningless bnx2fc_abts_cleanup() return value assignment

Commit 122c81c563b0 ("scsi: bnx2fc: Return failure if io_req is already in
ABTS processing") made bnx2fc_eh_abort() return FAILED when io_req was
alrady in ABTS processing, regardless of the return value of
bnx2fc_abts_cleanup().  However, the change left the assignment of the
return value of bnx2fc_abts_cleanup(). Remove this.
