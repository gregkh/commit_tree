RDMA/rxe: Add a type flag to rxe_queue structs

To create optimal code only want to use smp_load_acquire() and
smp_store_release() for user indices in rxe_queue APIs since kernel
indices are protected by locks which also act as memory barriers. By
adding a type to the queues we can determine which indices need to be
protected.
