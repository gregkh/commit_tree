wcn36xx: Run suspend for the first ieee80211_vif

A subsequent set of patches will extend out suspend/resume support in this
driver, we cannot set the firmware up for multiple ipv4/ipv6 addresses and
as such we can't iterate through a list of ieee80211_vif.

Constrain the interaction with the firmware to the first ieee80211_vif on
the suspend/resume/wowlan path.
