drm/amdgpu: Remove redundant ras->supported

Remove redundant ras->supported, as this value
is also stored in adev->ras_features.

Use adev->ras_features, as that supercedes "ras",
since the latter is its member.

The dependency goes like this:
ras <== adev->ras_features <== hw_supported,
and is read as "ras depends on ras_features, which
depends on hw_supported." The arrows show the flow
of information, i.e. the dependency update.

"hw_supported" should also live in "adev".
