s390/mcck: always enter C handler with DAT enabled

The machine check handler must be entered with DAT disabled
in case control registers are corrupted or a storage error
happened and we can not tell if such error corresponds to a
page table.

Both of described conditions end up in stopping all CPUs and
entering the disabled wait in C half of the handler. However,
the storage errors are still checked after the DAT is enabled
and C code is entered. In case a page table is damaged such
flow is not expected to work.

This update paves the way for moving the storage error checks
from C to assembler half. All fatal errors that can only be
handled with DAT disabled are handled in assembler half also.
As result, the C half is only entered if the DAT is secured.
