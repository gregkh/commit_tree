KVM: arm64: Introduce MTE VM feature

Add a new VM feature 'KVM_ARM_CAP_MTE' which enables memory tagging
for a VM. This will expose the feature to the guest and automatically
tag memory pages touched by the VM as PG_mte_tagged (and clear the tag
storage) to ensure that the guest cannot see stale tags, and so that
the tags are correctly saved/restored across swap.

Actually exposing the new capability to user space happens in a later
patch.
