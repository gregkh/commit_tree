Bluetooth: Fix handling of HCI_LE_Advertising_Set_Terminated event

Error status of this event means that it has ended due reasons other
than a connection:

 'If advertising has terminated as a result of the advertising duration
 elapsing, the Status parameter shall be set to the error code
 Advertising Timeout (0x3C).'

 'If advertising has terminated because the
 Max_Extended_Advertising_Events was reached, the Status parameter
 shall be set to the error code Limit Reached (0x43).'
