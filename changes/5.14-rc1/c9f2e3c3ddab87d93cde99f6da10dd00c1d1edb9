ASoC: cs42l42: make HSBIAS_SENSE_EN optional

HSBIAS_SENSE_EN configures HSBIAS output current sense through
the external 2.21-k resistor. HSBIAS_SENSE is hardware feature to reduce
the potential pop noise during the headset plug out slowly. But on some
platforms ESD voltage will affect it causing test to fail, especially
with CTIA headset type. For different hardware setups, a designer might
want to tweak default behavior.
