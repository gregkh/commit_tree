arm64: stacktrace: Relax frame record alignment requirement to 8 bytes

The AAPCS places no requirements on the alignment of the frame
record. In theory it could be placed anywhere, although it seems
sensible to require it to be aligned to 8 bytes. With an upcoming
enhancement to tag-based KASAN Clang will begin creating frame records
located at an address that is only aligned to 8 bytes. Accommodate
such frame records in the stack unwinding code.

As pointed out by Mark Rutland, the userspace stack unwinding code
has the same problem, so fix it there as well.
