serial: mvebu-uart: do not allow changing baudrate when uartclk is not available

Testing mvuart->clk for non-error is not enough as mvuart->clk may contain
valid clk pointer but when clk_prepare_enable(mvuart->clk) failed then
port->uartclk is zero.

When mvuart->clk is not available then port->uartclk is zero too.

Parent clock rate port->uartclk is needed to calculate UART clock divisor
and without it is not possible to change baudrate.

So fix test condition when it is possible to change baudrate.
