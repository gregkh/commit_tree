scsi: storvsc: Correctly handle multiple flags in srb_status

Hyper-V is observed to sometimes set multiple flags in the srb_status, such
as ABORTED and ERROR. Current code in storvsc_handle_error() handles only a
single flag being set, and does nothing when multiple flags are set.  Fix
this by changing the case statement into a series of "if" statements
testing individual flags. The functionality for handling each flag is
unchanged.
