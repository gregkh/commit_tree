ARM: dts: rockchip: move and restyle grf nodes rk3066/rk3188

With grf.txt converted to YAML a lot of compatibles
did not have 'simple-mfd' added in the old binding.
That implies that if you have child nodes they need
to be documented.
Make the new layout fit for rk3066/rk3188,
move and restyle the grf nodes.
Remove rockchip,grf from usbphy node.
Add "#phy-cells", because it is a required property
by phy-provider.yaml
With the conversion of syscon.yaml minItems for compatibles
was set to 2. Current Rockchip rk3xxx.dtsi file only uses "syscon"
for the grf registers. Add "syscon", "simple-mfd"
compatible for rk3066/rk3188 to reduce notifications produced with:

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.yaml

Changed compatibles:
"rockchip,rk3066-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
"rockchip,rk3188-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
