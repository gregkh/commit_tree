drm: allow drm_atomic_print_state() to accept any drm_printer

Currently drm_atomic_print_state() internally allocates and uses a
drm_info printer. Allow it to accept any drm_printer type so that
the API can be leveraged even for taking drm snapshot.

Rename the drm_atomic_print_state() to drm_atomic_print_new_state()
so that it reflects its functionality better.
