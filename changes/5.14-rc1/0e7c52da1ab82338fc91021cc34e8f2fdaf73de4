Documentation: checkpatch: Tweak BIT() macro include

While include/linux/bitops.h brings in the BIT() macro, it was moved to
include/linux/bits.h in commit 8bd9cb51daac ("locking/atomics, asm-generic:
Move some macros from <linux/bitops.h> to a new <linux/bits.h> file").

Since that commit BIT() has moved again into include/vdso/bits.h via
commit 3945ff37d2f4 ("linux/bits.h: Extract common header for vDSO").

I think the move to the vDSO header can be considered an implementation
detail, so for now update the checkpatch documentation to recommend use
of include/linux/bits.h.
