nvmet: allow mn change if subsys not discovered

Currently, once the subsystem's model_number is set for the first time
there is no way to change it. However, as long as no connection was
established to nvmf target, there is no reason for such restriction and
we should allow to change the subsystem's model_number as many times as
needed.

In addition, in order to simplfy the changes and make the model number
flow more similar to the rest of the attributes in the Identify
Controller data structure, we set a default value for the model number
at the initiation of the subsystem.
