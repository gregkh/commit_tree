pinctrl: mcp23s08: Add optional reset GPIO

The MCP23x port expander RESET# line can be connected to a host GPIO.
The optional reset-gpio must be set to LOW if the reset is asserted
at probing time.

On page 5 in the datasheet [0] the "Device Active After Reset high"
time is specified at 0 Âµs. Therefore no waiting is needed after the
reset transition.
