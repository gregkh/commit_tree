x86/irq: Remove unused vectors defines

UV_BAU_MESSAGE is defined but not used anywhere in the kernel. Presumably
this is a stale vector number that can be reclaimed.

MCE_VECTOR is not an actual vector: #MC is an exception, not an interrupt
vector, and as such is correctly described as X86_TRAP_MC. MCE_VECTOR is
not used anywhere is the kernel.

Note that NMI_VECTOR *is* used; specifically it is the vector number
programmed into the APIC LVT when an NMI interrupt is configured. At
the moment it is always numerically identical to X86_TRAP_NMI, that is
not necessarily going to be the case indefinitely.
