net: mdio: setup of_node for the MDIO device

By mistake, the of_node of the MDIO device was not setup in the patch
linked below. As a consequence, any PHY driver that depends on the
of_node in its probe callback was not be able to successfully finish its
probe on a PHY, thus the Generic PHY driver was used instead.

Fix this by actually setting up the of_node.
