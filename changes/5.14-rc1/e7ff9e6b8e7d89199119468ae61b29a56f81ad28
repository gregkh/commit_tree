btrfs: zoned: factor out zoned device lookup

To be able to construct a zone append bio we need to look up the
btrfs_device. The code doing the chunk map lookup to get the device is
present in btrfs_submit_compressed_write and submit_extent_page.

Factor out the lookup calls into a helper and use it in the submission
paths.
