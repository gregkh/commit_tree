vdpa/mlx5: Add support for running with virtio_vdpa

In order to support running vdpa using vritio_vdpa driver, we need  to
create a different kind of MR, one that has 1:1 mapping, since the
addresses referring to virtqueues are dma addresses.

We create the 1:1 MR in mlx5_vdpa_dev_add() only in case firmware
supports the general capability umem_uid_0. The reason for that is that
1:1 MRs must be created with uid == 0 while virtqueue objects can be
created with uid == 0 only when the firmware capability is on.

If the set_map() callback is called with new translations provided
through iotlb, the driver will destroy the 1:1 MR and create a regular
one.
