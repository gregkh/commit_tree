s390/smp: reallocate IPL CPU lowcore

The lowcore for IPL CPU is special. It is allocated early
in the boot process using memblock and never freed since.
The reason is pcpu_alloc_lowcore() and pcpu_free_lowcore()
routines use page allocator which is not available when
the IPL CPU is getting initialized.

Similar problem is already addressed for stacks - once the
virtual memory is available the early boot stacks get re-
allocated. Doing the same for lowcore will allow freeing
the IPL CPU lowcore and make no difference between the
boot and secondary CPUs.
