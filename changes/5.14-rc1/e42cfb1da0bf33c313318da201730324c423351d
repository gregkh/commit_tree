block: Remove unnecessary elevator operation checks

The insert_requests and dispatch_request elevator operations are
mandatory for the correct execution of an elevator, and all implemented
elevators (bfq, kyber and mq-deadline) implement them. As a result,
there is no need to check for these operations before calling them when
a queue has an elevator set. This simplifies the code in
__blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests() and blk_mq_sched_insert_request().

To avoid out-of-tree elevators to crash the kernel in case of bad
implementation, add a check in elv_register() to verify that these
operations are implemented.

A small, probably not significant, IOPS improvement of 0.1% is observed
with this patch applied (4.117 MIOPS to 4.123 MIOPS, average of 20 fio
runs doing 4K random direct reads with psync and 32 jobs).
