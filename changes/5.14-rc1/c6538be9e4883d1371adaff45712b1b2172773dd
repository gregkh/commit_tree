io_uring: refactor tctx task_work list splicing

We don't need a full copy of tctx->task_list in tctx_task_work(), but
only a first one, so just assign node directly.

Taking into account that task_works are run in a context of a task,
it's very unlikely to first see non-empty tctx->task_list and then
splice it empty, can only happen with task_work cancellations that is
not-normal slow path anyway. Hence, get rid of the check in the end,
it's there not for validity but "performance" purposes.
