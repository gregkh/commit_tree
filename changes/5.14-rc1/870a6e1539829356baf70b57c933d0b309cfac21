clocksource/drivers/ingenic: Rename unreasonable array names

1.Rename the "ingenic_ost_clk_info[]" to "x1000_ost_clk_info[]" to
  facilitate the addition of OST support for X2000 SoC in a later
  commit

2.When the OST support for X2000 SoC is added, there will be two
  compatible strings, so renaming "ingenic_ost_of_match[]" to
  "ingenic_ost_of_matches[]" is more reasonable

3.Remove the unnecessary comma in "ingenic_ost_of_matches[]" to reduce
  code size as much as possible.
