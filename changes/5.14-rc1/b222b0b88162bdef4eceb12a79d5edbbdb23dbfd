KVM: nSVM: refactor the CR3 reload on migration

Document the actual reason why we need to do it
on migration and move the call to svm_set_nested_state
to be closer to VMX code.

To avoid loading the PDPTRs from possibly not up to date memory map,
in nested_svm_load_cr3 after the move, move this code to
.get_nested_state_pages.
