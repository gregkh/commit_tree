EDAC/skx_common: Add new ADXL components for 2-level memory

Some Intel servers may configure memory in 2 levels, using
fast "near" memory (e.g. DDR) as a cache for larger, slower,
"far" memory (e.g. 3D X-point).

In these configurations the BIOS ADXL address translation for
an address in a 2-level memory range will provide details of
both the "near" and far components.

Current exported ADXL components are only for 1-level memory
system or for 2nd level memory of 2-level memory system. So
add new ADXL components for 1st level memory of 2-level memory
system to fully support 2-level memory system and the detection
of memory error source(1st level memory or 2nd level memory).
