net: hns3: refactor queue info of debugfs

Currently, the debugfs command for queue info is implemented by
"echo xxxx > cmd", and record the information in dmesg. It's
unnecessary and heavy. To improve it, create two files
"rx_queue_info" and "tx_queue_info" for it, and query it
by command "cat rx_queue_info" and "cat tx_queue_info",
return the result to userspace, rather than record in dmesg.

The display style is below:
$ cat rx_queue_info
QUEUE_ID  BD_NUM  BD_LEN  TAIL  HEAD  FBDNUM  PKTNUM   ...
0           0       0     0     0       0       0      ...
1           0       0     0     0       0       0      ...
2           0       0     0     0       0       0      ...

$ cat tx_queue_info
QUEUE_ID  BD_NUM  TC  TAIL  HEAD  FBDNUM  OFFSET  PKTNUM  ...
0           0     0     0     0       0       0        0  ...
1           0     0     0     0       0       0        0  ...
2           0     0     0     0       0       0        0  ...
