ACPI: PM / fan: Put fan device IDs into separate header file

The ACPI fan device IDs are shared between the fan driver and the
device power management code.  The former is modular, so it needs
to include the table of device IDs for module autoloading and the
latter needs that list to avoid attaching the generic ACPI PM domain
to fan devices (which doesn't make sense) possibly before the fan
driver module is loaded.

Unfortunately, that requires the list of fan device IDs to be
updated in two places which is prone to mistakes, so put it into
a symbol definition in a separate header file so there is only one
copy of it in case it needs to be updated again in the future.
