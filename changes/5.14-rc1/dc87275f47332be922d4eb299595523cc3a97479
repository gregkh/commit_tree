KVM: x86: Move (most) SMM hflags modifications into kvm_smm_changed()

Move the core of SMM hflags modifications into kvm_smm_changed() and use
kvm_smm_changed() in enter_smm().  Clear HF_SMM_INSIDE_NMI_MASK for
leaving SMM but do not set it for entering SMM.  If the vCPU is executing
outside of SMM, the flag should unequivocally be cleared, e.g. this
technically fixes a benign bug where the flag could be left set after
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS, but the reverse is not true as NMI blocking depends
on pre-SMM state or userspace input.

Note, this adds an extra kvm_mmu_reset_context() to enter_smm().  The
extra/early reset isn't strictly necessary, and in a way can never be
necessary since the vCPU/MMU context is in a half-baked state until the
final context reset at the end of the function.  But, enter_smm() is not
a hot path, and exploding on an invalid root_hpa is probably better than
having a stale SMM flag in the MMU role; it's at least no worse.
