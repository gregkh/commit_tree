arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Remove QUP-CORE ICC path

We had introduced the QUP-CORE ICC path to put proxy votes from
QUP wrapper on behalf of earlycon, if other users of QUP-CORE turn
off this clock before the real console is probed, unclocked access
to HW was seen from earlycon.

With ICC sync state support proxy votes are no longer need as ICC
will ensure that the default bootloader votes are not removed until
all it's consumer are probed.

We can safely remove ICC path for QUP-CORE clock from QUP wrapper
device.
