xfs: perag may be null in xfs_imap()

Dan Carpenter's static checker reported:

The patch 7b13c5155182: "xfs: use perag for ialloc btree cursors"
from Jun 2, 2021, leads to the following Smatch complaint:

    fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_ialloc.c:2403 xfs_imap()
    error: we previously assumed 'pag' could be null (see line 2294)

And it's right. Fix it.

Fixes: 7b13c5155182 ("xfs: use perag for ialloc btree cursors")
