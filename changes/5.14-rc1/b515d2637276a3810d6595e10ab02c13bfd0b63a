xfrm: xfrm_state_mtu should return at least 1280 for ipv6

Jianwen reported that IPv6 Interoperability tests are failing in an
IPsec case where one of the links between the IPsec peers has an MTU
of 1280. The peer generates a packet larger than this MTU, the router
replies with a "Packet too big" message indicating an MTU of 1280.
When the peer tries to send another large packet, xfrm_state_mtu
returns 1280 - ipsec_overhead, which causes ip6_setup_cork to fail
with EINVAL.

We can fix this by forcing xfrm_state_mtu to return IPV6_MIN_MTU when
IPv6 is used. After going through IPsec, the packet will then be
fragmented to obey the actual network's PMTU, just before leaving the
host.

Currently, TFC padding is capped to PMTU - overhead to avoid
fragementation: after padding and encapsulation, we still fit within
the PMTU. That behavior is preserved in this patch.
