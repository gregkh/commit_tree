drm/amdkfd: set owner ref to svm range prefault

svm_range_prefault is called right before migrations to VRAM,
to make sure pages are resident in system memory before the migration.
With partial migrations, this reference is used by hmm range get pages
to avoid migrating pages that are already in the same VRAM domain.
