clk: imx8qxp: add clock valid checking mechnism

clk-imx8qxp is a common SCU clock driver used by both QM and QXP
platforms. The clock numbers vary a bit between those two platforms.
This patch introduces a mechanism to only register the valid clocks
for one platform by checking the clk resource id table.
