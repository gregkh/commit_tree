s390: setup kernel memory layout early

Currently there are two separate places where kernel memory layout has
to be known and adjusted:
1. early kasan setup.
2. paging setup later.

Those 2 places had to be kept in sync and adjusted to reflect peculiar
technical details of one another. With additional factors which influence
kernel memory layout like ultravisor secure storage limit, complexity
of keeping two things in sync grew up even more.

Besides that if we look forward towards creating identity mapping and
enabling DAT before jumping into uncompressed kernel - that would also
require full knowledge of and control over kernel memory layout.

So, de-duplicate and move kernel memory layout setup logic into
the decompressor.
