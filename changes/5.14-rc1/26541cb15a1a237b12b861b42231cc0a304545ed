ALSA: firewire-lib: skip initial packets instead of scheduling IR context

Current implementation of ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 packet streaming engine
allows drivers to decide isochronous cycle to start IR context. This
option is mainly used to avoid processing the sequence of packet with
some quirks; e.g. discontinuity of counter. However, it's inconvenient
to fail to continue packet processing when the target device doesn't
start transmission of packet till the decided cycle.

This commit changes the behaviour. As an alternative to the start cycle
for IR context, the cycle count to drop content of packet in the beginning
of IR context.
