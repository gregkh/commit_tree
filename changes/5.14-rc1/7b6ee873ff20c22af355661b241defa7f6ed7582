netsec: Remove rcu_read_lock() around XDP program invocation

The netsec driver has a rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() pair around the
full RX loop, covering everything up to and including xdp_do_flush(). This
is actually the correct behaviour, but because it all happens in a single
NAPI poll cycle (and thus under local_bh_disable()), it is also technically
redundant.

With the addition of RCU annotations to the XDP_REDIRECT map types that
take bh execution into account, lockdep even understands this to be safe,
so there's really no reason to keep the rcu_read_lock() around anymore, so
let's just remove it.
