drm/amdgpu: fix the hang caused by PCIe link width switch

SMU had set all the necessary fields for a link width switch
but the width switch wasn't occurring because the link was idle
in the L1 state. Setting LC_L1_RECONFIG_EN=0x1 will allow width
switches to also be initiated while in L1 instead of waiting until
the link is back in L0.
