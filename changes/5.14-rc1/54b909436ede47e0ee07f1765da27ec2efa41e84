rtc: fix snprintf() checking in is_rtc_hctosys()

The scnprintf() function silently truncates the printf() and returns
the number bytes that it was able to copy (not counting the NUL
terminator).  Thus, the highest value it can return here is
"NAME_SIZE - 1" and the overflow check is dead code.  Fix this by
using the snprintf() function which returns the number of bytes that
would have been copied if there was enough space and changing the
condition from "> NAME_SIZE" to ">= NAME_SIZE".
