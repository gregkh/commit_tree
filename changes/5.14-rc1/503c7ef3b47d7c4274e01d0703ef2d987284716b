drm/i915/icl: add Wa_22010271021 for all gen11

Wa_22010271021 does not apply only to EHL, but to all gen11 and other
gen12 platforms. Gen12 is already covered in another code path, but we
need to stop checking for EHL when handling gen11.

Bspec: 33450, 52887

v2: Remove "gen11" suffix as it also applies to gen12 platforms
