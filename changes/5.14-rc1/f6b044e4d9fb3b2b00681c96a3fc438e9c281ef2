drm/i915/adl_p: Require a minimum of 8 tiles stride for DPT FBs

The specification only requires DPT FB strides to be POT aligned, but
there seems to be also a minimum of 8 stride tile requirement. Scanning
out FBs with < 8 stride tiles will result in pipe faults (even though
the stride is POT aligned).
