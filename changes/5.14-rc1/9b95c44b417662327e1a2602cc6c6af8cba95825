arm64: dts: imx8mq-evk: add one regulator used to power up pcie phy

Both 1.8v and 3.3v power supplies can be used by i.MX8MQ PCIe PHY.
In default, the PCIE_VPH voltage is suggested to be 1.8v refer to data
sheet. When PCIE_VPH is supplied by 3.3v in the HW schematic design,
the VREG_BYPASS bits of GPR registers should be cleared from default
value 1b'1 to 1b'0. Thus, the internal 3v3 to 1v8 translator would be
turned on.
