ASoC: rt715-sdca: fix clock stop prepare timeout issue

Fix clock stop prepare timeout issue (#2853).
The trigger of internal circuit which belong to
“SDCA preset stuffs” was not set correctly in previous driver,
which could block clock_stop_preparation state.
Add the correct register setting to fix it.
