extcon: extcon-max14577: Fix potential work-queue cancellation race

The extcon IRQ schedules a work item. IRQ is requested using devm while
WQ is cancelld at remove(). This mixing of devm and manual unwinding has
potential case where the WQ has been emptied (.remove() was ran) but
devm unwinding of IRQ was not yet done. It is possible the IRQ is triggered
at this point scheduling new work item to the already flushed queue.

Use new devm_work_autocancel() to remove the remove() and to kill the bug.
