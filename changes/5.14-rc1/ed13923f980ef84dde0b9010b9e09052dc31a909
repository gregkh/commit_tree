ipv6: Add a sysctl to control multipath hash fields

A subsequent patch will add a new multipath hash policy where the packet
fields used for multipath hash calculation are determined by user space.
This patch adds a sysctl that allows user space to set these fields.

The packet fields are represented using a bitmask and are common between
IPv4 and IPv6 to allow user space to use the same numbering across both
protocols. For example, to hash based on standard 5-tuple:

 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.fib_multipath_hash_fields=0x0037
 net.ipv6.fib_multipath_hash_fields = 0x0037

To avoid introducing holes in 'struct netns_sysctl_ipv6', move the
'bindv6only' field after the multipath hash fields.

The kernel rejects unknown fields, for example:

 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.fib_multipath_hash_fields=0x1000
 sysctl: setting key "net.ipv6.fib_multipath_hash_fields": Invalid argument
