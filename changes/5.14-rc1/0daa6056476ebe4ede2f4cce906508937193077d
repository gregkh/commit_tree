dt-bindings: mailbox : arm,mhuv2: Use example with matching schema

Currently the example provided in arm,mhuv2 schema complains as below:

    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/arm,mhuv2.example.dt.yaml :0:0:
    /example-0/soc/scb@2e000000: failed to match any schema with compatible:
    ['fujitsu,mb86s70-scb-1.0']

Fix it by using an example with a matching schema that makes use of 4
mailboxes that is well suited to demonstrate Rx and Tx channels with both
doorbell and data transfer protocols.
