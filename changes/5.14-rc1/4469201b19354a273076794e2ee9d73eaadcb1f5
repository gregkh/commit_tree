drm/amd/display: DETBufferSizeInKbyte variable type modifications

[Why]
DETBufferSizeInKByte is not expected to be sub-dividable, hence
unsigned int is a better suited data-type. Change it to an array
as well to satisfy current requirements.

[How]
Change the data-type of DETBufferSizeInKByte to an unsigned int
array. Modify the all the variables like DETBufferSizeY,
DETBufferSizeC that are involved in DETBufferSizeInKByte calculations
to unsigned int in all the display_mode_vba_xx files.
