slub: force on no_hash_pointers when slub_debug is enabled

Obscuring the pointers that slub shows when debugging makes for some
confusing slub debug messages:

 Padding overwritten. 0x0000000079f0674a-0x000000000d4dce17

Those addresses are hashed for kernel security reasons.  If we're trying
to be secure with slub_debug on the commandline we have some big problems
given that we dump whole chunks of kernel memory to the kernel logs.
Let's force on the no_hash_pointers commandline flag when slub_debug is on
the commandline.  This makes slub debug messages more meaningful and if by
chance a kernel address is in some slub debug object dump we will have a
better chance of figuring out what went wrong.

Note that we don't use %px in the slub code because we want to reduce the
number of places that %px is used in the kernel.  This also nicely prints
a big fat warning at kernel boot if slub_debug is on the commandline so
that we know that this kernel shouldn't be used on production systems.
