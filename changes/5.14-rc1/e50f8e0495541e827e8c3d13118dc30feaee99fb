iio: buffer: Remove redundant assignment to in_loc

Variable in_loc is being assigned a value from a calculation
however the assignment is never read, so this redundant assignment
can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/iio/industrialio-buffer.c:929:3: warning: Value stored to
'in_loc' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
