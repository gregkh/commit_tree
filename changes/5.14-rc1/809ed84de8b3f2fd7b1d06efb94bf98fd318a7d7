selftests/bpf: Whitelist test_progs.h from .gitignore

Somehow test_progs.h was being included by the existing rule:

    /test_progs*

This is bad because:

    1) test_progs.h is a checked in file
    2) grep-like tools like ripgrep[0] respect gitignore and
       test_progs.h was being hidden from searches
