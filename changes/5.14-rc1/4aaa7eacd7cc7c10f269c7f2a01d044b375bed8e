x86/insn: Extend error reporting from insn_fetch_from_user[_inatomic]()

The error reporting from the insn_fetch_from_user*() functions is not
very verbose. Extend it to include information on whether the linear
RIP could not be calculated or whether the memory access faulted.

This will be used in the SEV-ES code to propagate the correct
exception depending on what went wrong during instruction fetch.
