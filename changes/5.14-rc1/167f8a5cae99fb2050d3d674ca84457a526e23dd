KVM: x86/mmu: Rename "nxe" role bit to "efer_nx" for macro shenanigans

Rename "nxe" to "efer_nx" so that future macro magic can use the pattern
<reg>_<bit> for all CR0, CR4, and EFER bits that included in the role.
Using "efer_nx" also makes it clear that the role bit reflects EFER.NX,
not the NX bit in the corresponding PTE.
