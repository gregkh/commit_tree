hw_random: ixp4xx: Turn into a module

Instead of just initializing always, which will invariably
create problems on multiplatform builds, turn this driver into
a module and pass a resource with the memory location.
The device only exist on the IXP46x so we only register
the device for the IXP46x SoC.
