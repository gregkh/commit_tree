powerpc/64e: remove implicit soft-masking and interrupt exit restart logic

The implicit soft-masking to speed up interrupt return was going to be
used by 64e as well, but it has not been extensively tested on that
platform and is not considered ready. It was intended to be disabled
before merge. Disable it for now.

Most of the restart code is common with 64s, so with more correctness
and performance testing this could be re-enabled again by adding the
extra soft-mask checks to interrupt handlers and flipping
exit_must_hard_disable().
