PCI: microchip: Make the struct event_descs static

The struct event_descs does not have any users outside the
pcie-microchip-host.c file, and has no previous declaration,
thus it can be made static.

This resolves the following sparse warning:

  drivers/pci/controller/pcie-microchip-host.c:352:3: warning: symbol 'event_descs' was not declared. Should it be static?
