drm/dp_mst: Use kHz as link rate units when settig source max link caps at init

[why]
Link rate in kHz is what is eventually required to calculate the link
bandwidth, which makes kHz a more generic unit. This should also make
forward-compatibility with new DP standards easier.

[how]
- Replace 'link rate DPCD code' with 'link rate in kHz' when used with
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_init()
- Add/remove related DPCD code conversion from/to kHz where applicable
