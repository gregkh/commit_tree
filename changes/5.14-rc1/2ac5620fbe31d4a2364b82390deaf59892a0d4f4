drm/i915/adl_p: Add stride restriction when using DPT

Alderlake-P have a new stride restriction when using DPT and it is used
by non linear framebuffers. Stride needs to be a power of two to take
full DPT rows, but stride is a parameter set by userspace.

What we could do is use a fake stride when doing DPT allocation so
HW requirements are met and userspace don't need to be changed to
met this power of two restrictions but this change will take a while
to be implemented so for now adding this restriction in driver to
reject atomic commits that would cause visual corruptions.
