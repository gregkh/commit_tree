PCI: hv: Add check for hyperv_initialized in init_hv_pci_drv()

Add check for hv_is_hyperv_initialized() at the top of
init_hv_pci_drv(), so if the pci-hyperv driver is force-loaded on non
Hyper-V platforms, the init_hv_pci_drv() will exit immediately, without
any side effects, like assignments to hvpci_block_ops, etc.
