drm/i915: finish removal of gen_mask

Now that it's not used anywhere, remove it from struct
intel_device_info. To allow a period in which code will be converted to
the new macro, keep IS_GEN_RANGE() around, just redefining it to use
the new fields. The size advantage from IS_GEN_RANGE() using a mask is
not that big as it has pretty limited use througout the driver:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
