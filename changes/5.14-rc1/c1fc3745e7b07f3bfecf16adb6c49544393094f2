dmaengine: sh: Remove unused shdma-of driver

Remove the DT-based Renesas SHDMA DMA multiplexer driver, as it is
unused.  The DMA multiplexer node and one DMA controller instance were
added to the R-Mobile APE6 .dtsi file, but DMA support was never fully
enabled, cfr. commit a19788612f51b787 ("dmaengine: sh: Remove R-Mobile
APE6 support").
