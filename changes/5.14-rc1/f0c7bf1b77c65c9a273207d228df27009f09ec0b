locking/atomic: openrisc: avoid asm-generic/atomic.h

OpenRISC is the only architecture which uses asm-generic/atomic.h and
also provides its own implementation of some functions, requiring
ifdeferry in the asm-generic header. As OpenRISC provides the vast
majority of functions itself, it would be simpler overall if it also
provided the few functions it cribs from asm-generic.

This patch decouples OpenRISC from asm-generic/atomic.h. Subsequent
patches will simplify the asm-generic implementation and remove the now
unnecessary ifdeferry.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
