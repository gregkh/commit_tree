mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Use mailbox rx_callback

rx_callback is a standard mailbox callback mechanism and could cover the
function of proprietary cmdq_task_cb, so use the standard one instead of
the proprietary one. But the client driver has already used cmdq_task_cb,
so keep cmdq_task_cb until all client driver use rx_callback instead of
cmdq_task_cb.
