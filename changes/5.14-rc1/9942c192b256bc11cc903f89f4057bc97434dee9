af_vsock: implement SEQPACKET receive loop

Add receive loop for SEQPACKET. It looks like receive loop for
STREAM, but there are differences:
1) It doesn't call notify callbacks.
2) It doesn't care about 'SO_SNDLOWAT' and 'SO_RCVLOWAT' values, because
   there is no sense for these values in SEQPACKET case.
3) It waits until whole record is received.
4) It processes and sets 'MSG_TRUNC' flag.

So to avoid extra conditions for two types of socket inside one loop, two
independent functions were created.
