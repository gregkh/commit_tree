btrfs: return EAGAIN if defrag is canceled

When inode defrag is canceled, the error is set to EAGAIN but then
overwritten by number of defragmented bytes. As this would hide the
error, rather return EAGAIN. This does not harm 'btrfs fi defrag', it
will print the error and continue to next file (as it does in for any
other error).
