PM: runtime: Allow unassigned ->runtime_suspend|resume callbacks

We are currently allowing ->runtime_idle() callbacks to be unassigned
without returning an error code from rpm_idle(). This has been useful to
avoid boilerplate code in drivers. Let's take this approach a step further,
by allowing also unassigned ->runtime_suspend|resume() callbacks.

In this way, a consumer/supplier device link can be used to let a consumer
device be power managed through its supplier device, without requiring
assigned ->runtime_suspend|resume() callbacks for the consumer device, for
example.
