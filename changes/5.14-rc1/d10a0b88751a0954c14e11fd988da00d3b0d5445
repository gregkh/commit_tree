fs: dlm: rename socket and app buffer defines

This patch renames DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE to DLM_MAX_SOCKET_BUFSIZE and
LOWCOMMS_MAX_TX_BUFFER_LEN to DLM_MAX_APP_BUFSIZE as they are proper
names to define what's behind those values. The DLM_MAX_SOCKET_BUFSIZE
defines the maximum size of buffer which can be handled on socket layer,
the DLM_MAX_APP_BUFSIZE defines the maximum size of buffer which can be
handled by the DLM application layer.
