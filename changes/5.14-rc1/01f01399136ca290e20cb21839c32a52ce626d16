ocfs2: remove repeated uptodate check for buffer

In commit 60f91826ca62 ("buffer: Avoid setting buffer bits that are
already set"), function set_buffer_##name was added a test_bit() to check
buffer, which is the same as function buffer_##name.  The
!buffer_uptodate(bh) here is a repeated check.  Remove it.
