f2fs: Advertise encrypted casefolding in sysfs

Older kernels don't support encryption with casefolding. This adds
the sysfs entry encrypted_casefold to show support for those combined
features. Support for this feature was originally added by
commit 7ad08a58bf67 ("f2fs: Handle casefolding with Encryption")

Fixes: 7ad08a58bf67 ("f2fs: Handle casefolding with Encryption")
