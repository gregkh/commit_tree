arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Allow multiple DAI links

simple-audio-card supports either a single DAI link at the top level, or
subnodes with one or more DAI links. To use the secondary AIFs on the
codec, we need to add additional DAI links to the same sound card, so we
need to use the other binding.
