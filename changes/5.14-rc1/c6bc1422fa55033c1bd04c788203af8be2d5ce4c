virtio-mem: simplify high-level unplug handling in Big Block Mode

Let's simplify high-level big block selection when unplugging in
Big Block Mode.

Combine handling of offline and online blocks. We can get rid of
virtio_mem_bbm_bb_is_offline() and simply use
virtio_mem_bbm_offline_remove_and_unplug_bb(), as that already tolerates
offline parts.

We can race with concurrent onlining/offlining either way, so we don;t
have to be super correct by failing if an offline big block we'd like to
unplug just got (partially) onlined.
