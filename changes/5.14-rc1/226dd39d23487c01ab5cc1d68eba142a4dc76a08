torture: Make kvm-find-errors.sh account for kvm-remote.sh

Currently, kvm-find-errors.sh assumes that if "--buildonly" appears in
the log file, then the run did builds but ran no kernels.  This breaks
with kvm-remote.sh, which uses kvm.sh to do a build, then kvm-again.sh
to run the kernels built on remote systems.  This commit therefore adds
a check for a kvm-remote.sh run.

While in the area, this commit checks for "--build-only" as well as
"--build-only".
