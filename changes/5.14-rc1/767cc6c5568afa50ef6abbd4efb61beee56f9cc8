mm/z3fold: remove unused function handle_to_z3fold_header()

handle_to_z3fold_header() is unused now.  So we can remove it.  As a
result, get_z3fold_header() becomes the only caller of
__get_z3fold_header() and the argument lock is always true.  Therefore we
could further fold the __get_z3fold_header() into get_z3fold_header() with
lock = true.
