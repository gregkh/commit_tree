drm/amd/display: fix potential gpu reset deadlock

[Why]
In gpu reset dc_lock acquired in dm_suspend().
Asynchronously handle_hpd_rx_irq can also be called
through amdgpu_dm_irq_suspend->flush_work, which also
tries to acquire dc_lock. That causes a deadlock.

[How]
Check if amdgpu executing reset before acquiring dc_lock.
