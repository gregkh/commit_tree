brcmfmac: correctly report average RSSI in station info

The rx_lastpkt_rssi field provided by the firmware is suitable for
NL80211_STA_INFO_{SIGNAL,CHAIN_SIGNAL}, while the rssi field is an
average. Fix up the assignments and set the correct STA_INFO bits. This
lets userspace know that the average RSSI is part of the station info.
