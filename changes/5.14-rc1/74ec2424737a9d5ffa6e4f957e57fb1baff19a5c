IB/srpt: Remove redundant assignment to ret

Variable 'ret' is set to -ENOMEM but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant assignment
and can be removed

In 'commit b79fafac70fc ("target: make queue_tm_rsp() return void")'
srpt_queue_response() has been changed to return void, so after "goto
out", there is no need to return ret.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/infiniband/ulp/srpt/ib_srpt.c:2860:3: warning: Value stored to
'ret' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]

Fixes: b99f8e4d7bcd ("IB/srpt: convert to the generic RDMA READ/WRITE API")
