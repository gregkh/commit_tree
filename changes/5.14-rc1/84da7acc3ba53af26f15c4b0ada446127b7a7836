block: avoid double io accounting for flush request

For flush request, rq->end_io() may be called two times, one is from
timeout handling(blk_mq_check_expired()), another is from normal
completion(__blk_mq_end_request()).

Move blk_account_io_flush() after flush_rq->ref drops to zero, so
io accounting can be done just once for flush request.
