ACPICA: Fix memory leak caused by _CID repair function

ACPICA commit 180cb53963aa876c782a6f52cc155d951b26051a

According to the ACPI spec, _CID returns a package containing
hardware ID's. Each element of an ASL package contains a reference
count from the parent package as well as the element itself.

Name (TEST, Package() {
    "String object" // this package element has a reference count of 2
})

A memory leak was caused in the _CID repair function because it did
not decrement the reference count created by the package. Fix the
memory leak by calling acpi_ut_remove_reference on _CID package elements
that represent a hardware ID (_HID).
