ALSA: firewire-lib: start processing content of packet at the same cycle in several IT contexts

DICE ASICs support several pairs of isochronous packet streaming and
expect software to queue packets with the same timing information into
the same isochronous cycle.

This commit adds structure member to manage the cycle to start
processing packet in several IT contexts. The cycle is decided when
batch of isochronous cycle is skipped in callback to isochronous context
for IRQ target.
