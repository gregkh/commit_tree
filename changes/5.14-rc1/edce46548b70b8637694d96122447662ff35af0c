KVM: x86: Replace .set_hflags() with dedicated .exiting_smm() helper

Replace the .set_hflags() emulator hook with a dedicated .exiting_smm(),
moving the SMM and SMM_INSIDE_NMI flag handling out of the emulator in
the process.  This is a step towards consolidating much of the logic in
kvm_smm_changed(), including the SMM hflags updates.

No functional change intended.
