ACPI: Move IOMMU setup code out of IORT

Extract the code that sets up the IOMMU infrastructure from IORT, since
it can be reused by VIOT. Move it one level up into a new
acpi_iommu_configure_id() function, which calls the IORT parsing
function which in turn calls the acpi_iommu_fwspec_init() helper.
