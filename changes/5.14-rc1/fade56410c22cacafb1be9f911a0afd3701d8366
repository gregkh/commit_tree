net: lwtunnel: handle MTU calculation in forwading

Commit 14972cbd34ff ("net: lwtunnel: Handle fragmentation") moved
fragmentation logic away from lwtunnel by carry encap headroom and
use it in output MTU calculation. But the forwarding part was not
covered and created difference in MTU for output and forwarding and
further to silent drops on ipv4 forwarding path. Fix it by taking
into account lwtunnel encap headroom.

The same commit also introduced difference in how to treat RTAX_MTU
in IPv4 and IPv6 where latter explicitly removes lwtunnel encap
headroom from route MTU. Make IPv4 version do the same.
