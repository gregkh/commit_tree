iio: gyro: fxa21002c: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get().

In both the probe() error path and remove() pm_runtime_put_noidle()
is called which will decrement the runtime pm reference count.
However, there is no matching function to have raised the reference count.
Not this isn't a fix as the runtime pm core will stop the reference count
going negative anyway.

An alternative would have been to raise the count in these paths, but
it is not clear why that would be necessary.

Whilst we are here replace some boilerplate with pm_runtime_resume_and_get()
