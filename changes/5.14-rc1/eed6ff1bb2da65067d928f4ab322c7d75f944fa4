soc: mtk-pm-domains: do not register smi node as syscon

Mediatek requires mmsys clocks to be unprepared during suspend,
otherwise system has chances to hang.

syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle_optional() will attach and prepare the
first clock in smi node, leading to additional prepare to the clock
which is not balanced with the prepare/unprepare pair in resume/suspend
callbacks.

If a power domain node requests an smi node and the smi node's first
clock is an mmsys clock, it will results in an unstable suspend resume.
