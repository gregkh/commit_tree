s390/boot: replace magic string check with a bootdata flag

The magic string "S390EP" at offset 0x10008 indicated to the decompressed
kernel that it was booted by the decompressor. Introduce a new bootdata
flag instead which conveys the same information in an explicit and
a cleaner way. But keep the magic string because it is a kernel ABI.
