ALSA: rme96: Fix assignment in if condition

PCI RME96 driver code contains a few assignments in if condition,
which is a bad coding style that may confuse readers and occasionally
lead to bugs.

This patch is merely for coding-style fixes (only systematic
conversions except for a few rate handling codes), no functional
changes.
