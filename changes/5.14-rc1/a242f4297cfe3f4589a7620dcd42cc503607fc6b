iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Skip the TTBR1 quirk for db820c.

db820c wants to use the qcom smmu path to get HUPCF set (which keeps
the GPU from wedging and then sometimes wedging the kernel after a
page fault), but it doesn't have separate pagetables support yet in
drm/msm so we can't go all the way to the TTBR1 path.
