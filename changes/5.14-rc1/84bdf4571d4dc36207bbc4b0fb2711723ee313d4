drm/i915/guc: Use guc_class instead of engine_class in fw interface

GuC has its own defines for the engine classes. They're currently
mapping 1:1 to the defines used by the driver, but there is no guarantee
this will continue in the future. Given that we've been caught off-guard
in the past by similar divergences, we can prepare for the changes by
introducing helper functions to convert from engine class to GuC class and
back again.
