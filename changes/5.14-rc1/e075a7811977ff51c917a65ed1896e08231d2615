drm/vc4: hdmi: Fix error path of hpd-gpios

If the of_get_named_gpio_flags call fails in vc4_hdmi_bind, we jump to
the err_unprepare_hsm label. That label will then call
pm_runtime_disable and put_device on the DDC device.

We just retrieved the DDC device, so the latter is definitely justified.
However at that point we still haven't called pm_runtime_enable, so the
call to pm_runtime_disable is not supposed to be there.
