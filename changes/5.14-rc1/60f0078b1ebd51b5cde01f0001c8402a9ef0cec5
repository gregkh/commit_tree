wcn36xx: Add Host suspend indication support

In order to activate ipv4 ARP offload, ipv6 NS offload and firmware GTK
offload we need to send a unidirectional indication from host to wcn
indicating a transition to suspend.

Once done, firmware will respond to ARP broadcasts, ipv6 NS lookups and
perform GTK rekeys without waking the host.
