x86/syscalls: Use __NR_syscalls instead of __NR_syscall_max

__NR_syscall_max is only used by x86 and UML. In contrast, __NR_syscalls is
widely used by all the architectures.

Convert __NR_syscall_max to __NR_syscalls and adjust the usage sites.

This prepares x86 to switch to the generic syscallhdr.sh script.
