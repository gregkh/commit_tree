ALSA: firewire-motu: fix rx packet format at higher rate for MOTU 828 mk3 Hybrid

I assumed that the combination of packet formats for MOTU 828 mk3 Hybrid
is the same as MOTU 828 mk3 FireWire. However at higher sampling rate, it
is different. MOTU 828 mk3 Hybrid has additional 4 dummy data chunks for
rx packet.

This commit fixes the issue to which I address at a commit f2ac3b839540
("ALSA: firewire-motu: sequence replay for source packet header").
