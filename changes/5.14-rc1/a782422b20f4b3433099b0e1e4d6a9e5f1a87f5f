habanalabs: notify before f/w loading

An information print notifying on starting to load the f/w was removed
by mistake when moving to the new dynamic f/w loading mechanism.

Restore that print as the F/W loading usually takes between 10 to 20
seconds and this print helps the user know the status of the driver
load.
