evm: Deprecate EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES

This patch deprecates the usage of EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES, as it is no
longer necessary. All the issues that prevent the usage of EVM portable
signatures just with a public key loaded have been solved.

This flag will remain available for a short time to ensure that users are
able to use EVM without it.
