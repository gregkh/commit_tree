RDMA/rtrs: Avoid Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare

drivers/infiniband/ulp/rtrs/rtrs-clt.c:1786:19: warning: result of comparison of
constant 'MAX_SESS_QUEUE_DEPTH' (65536) with expression of type 'u16'
(aka 'unsigned short') is always false [-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]

To fix it, limit MAX_SESS_QUEUE_DEPTH to u16 max, which is 65535, and
drop the check in rtrs-clt, as it's the type u16 max.
