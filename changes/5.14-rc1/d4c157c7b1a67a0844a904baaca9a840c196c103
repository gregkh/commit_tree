locking/lockdep: Remove the unnecessary trace saving

In print_bad_irq_dependency(), save_trace() is called to set the ->trace
for @prev_root as the current call trace, however @prev_root corresponds
to the the held lock, which may not be acquired in current call trace,
therefore it's wrong to use save_trace() to set ->trace of @prev_root.
Moreover, with our adjustment of printing backwards dependency path, the
->trace of @prev_root is unncessary, so remove it.
