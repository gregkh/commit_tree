mm, tracing: unify PFN format strings

Some trace event formats print PFNs as hex while others print them as
decimal.  This is rather annoying when attempting to grep through traces
to understand what's going on with a particular page.

 $ git grep -ho 'pfn=[0x%lu]\+' include/trace/events/ | sort | uniq -c
      11 pfn=0x%lx
      12 pfn=%lu
       2 pfn=%lx

Printing as hex is in the majority in the trace events, and all the normal
printks in mm/ also print PFNs as hex, so change all the PFN formats in
the trace events to use 0x%lx.
