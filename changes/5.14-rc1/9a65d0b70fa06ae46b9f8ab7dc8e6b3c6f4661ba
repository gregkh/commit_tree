KVM: x86/mmu: Get CR4.SMEP from MMU, not vCPU, in shadow page fault

Use the current MMU instead of vCPU state to query CR4.SMEP when handling
a page fault.  In the nested NPT case, the current CR4.SMEP reflects L2,
whereas the page fault is shadowing L1's NPT, which uses L1's hCR4.
Practically speaking, this is a nop a NPT walks are always user faults,
i.e. this code will never be reached, but fix it up for consistency.
