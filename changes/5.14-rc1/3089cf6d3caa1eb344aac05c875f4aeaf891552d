ice: add tracepoints

This patch is modeled after one by Scott Peterson for i40e.

Add tracepoints to the driver, via a new file ice_trace.h and some new
trace calls added in interesting places in the driver. Add some tracing
for DIMLIB to help debug interrupt moderation problems.

Performance should not be affected, and this can be very useful
for debugging and adding new trace events to paths in the future.

Note eBPF programs can attach to these events, as well as perf
can count them since we're attaching to the events subsystem
in the kernel.
