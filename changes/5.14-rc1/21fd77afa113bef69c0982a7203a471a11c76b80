iio: imu: remove unused private data assigned with spi_set_drvdata()

These were usually used before the conversion to devm_ functions, so that
the remove hook would be able to retrieve the pointer and do cleanups on
remove.
When the conversion happened, they should have been removed, but were
omitted.

Some drivers were copied from drivers that fit the criteria described
above. In any case, in order to prevent more drivers from being used as
example (and have spi_set_drvdata() needlessly set), this change removes it
from the IIO IMU group.
