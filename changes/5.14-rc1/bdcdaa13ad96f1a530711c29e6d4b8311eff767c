PCI/sysfs: Fix dsm_label_utf16s_to_utf8s() buffer overrun

"utf16s_to_utf8s(..., buf, PAGE_SIZE)" puts up to PAGE_SIZE bytes into
"buf" and returns the number of bytes it actually put there.  If it wrote
PAGE_SIZE bytes, the newline added by dsm_label_utf16s_to_utf8s() would
overrun "buf".

Reduce the size available for utf16s_to_utf8s() to use so there is always
space for the newline.
