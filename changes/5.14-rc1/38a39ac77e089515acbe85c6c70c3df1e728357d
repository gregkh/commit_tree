btrfs: pass btrfs_inode to btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered()

There is a pretty bad abuse of btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered() in
end_compressed_bio_write().

It passes compressed pages to btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered(),
which is only supposed to accept inode pages.

Thankfully the important info here is the inode, so let's pass
btrfs_inode directly into btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered(), and
make @page parameter optional.

By this, end_compressed_bio_write() can happily pass page=NULL while
still getting everything done properly.

Also, to cooperate with such modification, replace @page parameter for
trace_btrfs_writepage_end_io_hook() with btrfs_inode.
Although this removes page_index info, the existing start/len should be
enough for most usage.
