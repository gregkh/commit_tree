ARM: dts: rockchip: add power controller for RK3036

Add the power controller node and the correspondending qos nodes for
RK3036.
Also add the power-domain property to the nodes that are already
present.
Note: Since the regiser offsets of the axi interconnect QoS are missing
in the TRM (RK3036 TRM V1.0), they have been taken from vendor kernel.
