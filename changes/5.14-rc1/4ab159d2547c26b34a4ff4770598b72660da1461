drm/amdkfd: Add CONFIG_HSA_AMD_SVM

Control whether to build SVM support into amdgpu with a Kconfig option.
This makes it easier to disable it in production kernels if this new
feature causes problems in production environments.

Use "depends on" instead of "select" for DEVICE_PRIVATE, as is
recommended for visible options.
