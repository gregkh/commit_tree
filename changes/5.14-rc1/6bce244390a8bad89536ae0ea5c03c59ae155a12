mm/page_alloc: Revert pahole zero-sized workaround

Commit dbbee9d5cd83 ("mm/page_alloc: convert per-cpu list protection to
local_lock") folded in a workaround patch for pahole that was unable to
deal with zero-sized percpu structures.

A superior workaround is achieved with commit a0b8200d06ad ("kbuild:
skip per-CPU BTF generation for pahole v1.18-v1.21").

This patch reverts the dummy field and the pahole version check.
