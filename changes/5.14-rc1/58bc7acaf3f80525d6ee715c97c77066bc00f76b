RDMA/hns: Delete unnecessary branch of hns_roce_v2_query_qp

When query_qp is called by userspace, max_send_wr and max_send_sge are set
to 0 by the kernel driver. However, the userspace does not use these two
return values from the kernel driver, but uses its own calculated values.
So there is no need for special treatment.
