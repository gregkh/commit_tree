net/smc: Add SMC statistics support

Add the ability to collect SMC statistics information. Per-cpu
variables are used to collect the statistic information for better
performance and for reducing concurrency pitfalls. The code that is
collecting statistic data is implemented in macros to increase code
reuse and readability.
