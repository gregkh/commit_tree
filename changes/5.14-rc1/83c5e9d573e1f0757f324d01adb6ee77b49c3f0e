sched/fair: Return early from update_tg_cfs_load() if delta == 0

In case the _avg delta is 0 there is no need to update se's _avg
(level n) nor cfs_rq's _avg (level n-1). These values stay the same.

Since cfs_rq's _avg isn't changed, i.e. no load is propagated down,
cfs_rq's _sum should stay the same as well.

So bail out after se's _sum has been updated.
