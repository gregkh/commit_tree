lib: add iomem emulation (logic_iomem)

Add IO memory emulation that uses callbacks for read/write to
the allocated regions. The callbacks can be registered by the
users using logic_iomem_alloc().

To use, an architecture must 'select LOGIC_IOMEM' in Kconfig
and then include <asm-generic/logic_io.h> into asm/io.h to get
the __raw_read*/__raw_write* functions.

Optionally, an architecture may 'select LOGIC_IOMEM_FALLBACK'
in which case non-emulated regions will 'fall back' to the
various real_* functions that must then be provided.
