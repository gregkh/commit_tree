rcutorture: Consolidate rcu_torture_boost() timing and statistics

This commit consolidates two loops in rcu_torture_boost(), one of which
counts the number of boost-test episodes and the other of which computes
the start time of the next episode, into one loop that does both with but
a single acquisition of boost_mutex.  This means that the count of the
number of boost-test episodes is incremented after an episode completes
rather than before it starts, but it also avoids the over-counting that
was possible previously.
