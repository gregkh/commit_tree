drm/amdkfd: Fix circular lock in nocpsch path

Calling free_mqd inside of destroy_queue_nocpsch_locked can cause a
circular lock. destroy_queue_nocpsch_locked is called under a DQM lock,
which is taken in MMU notifiers, potentially in FS reclaim context.
Taking another lock, which is BO reservation lock from free_mqd, while
causing an FS reclaim inside the DQM lock creates a problematic circular
lock dependency. Therefore move free_mqd out of
destroy_queue_nocpsch_locked and call it after unlocking DQM.
