icmp: fix lib conflict with trinity

Including <linux/in.h> and <netinet/in.h> in the dependencies breaks
compilation of trinity due to multiple definitions. <linux/in.h> is only
used in <linux/icmp.h> to provide the definition of the struct in_addr,
but this can be substituted out by using the datatype __be32.
