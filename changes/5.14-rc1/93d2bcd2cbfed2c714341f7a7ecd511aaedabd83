io_uring: make fail flag not link specific

The main difference is in req_set_fail_links() renamed into
req_set_fail(), which now sets REQ_F_FAIL_LINK/REQ_F_FAIL flag
unconditional on whether it has been a link or not. It only matters in
io_disarm_next(), which already handles it well, and all calls to it
have a fast path checking REQ_F_LINK/HARDLINK.

It looks cleaner, and sheds binary size
