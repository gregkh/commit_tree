xfs: push perags through the ag reservation callouts

We currently pass an agno from the AG reservation functions to the
individual feature accounting functions, which in future may have to
do perag lookups to access per-AG state. Instead, pre-emptively
plumb the perag through from the highest AG reservation layer to the
feature callouts so they won't have to look it up again.
