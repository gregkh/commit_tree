platform/x86: Add intel_skl_int3472 driver

ACPI devices with _HID INT3472 are currently matched to the tps68470
driver, however this does not cover all situations in which that _HID
occurs. We've encountered three possibilities:

1. On Chrome OS devices, an ACPI device with _HID INT3472 (representing
a physical TPS68470 device) that requires a GPIO and OpRegion driver
2. On devices designed for Windows, an ACPI device with _HID INT3472
(again representing a physical TPS68470 device) which requires GPIO,
Clock and Regulator drivers.
3. On other devices designed for Windows, an ACPI device with _HID
INT3472 which does **not** represent a physical TPS68470, and is instead
used as a dummy device to group some system GPIO lines which are meant
to be consumed by the sensor that is dependent on this entry.

This commit adds a new module, registering a platform driver to deal
with the 3rd scenario plus an i2c driver to deal with #1 and #2, by
querying the CLDB buffer found against INT3472 entries to determine
which is most appropriate.
