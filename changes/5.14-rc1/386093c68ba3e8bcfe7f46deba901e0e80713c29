um: allow not setting extra rpaths in the linux binary

There doesn't seem to be any reason for the rpath being set in
the binaries, at on systems that I tested on. On the other hand,
setting rpath is actually harming binaries in some cases, e.g.
if using nix-based compilation environments where /lib & /lib64
are not part of the actual environment.

Add a new Kconfig option (under EXPERT, for less user confusion)
that allows disabling the rpath additions.
