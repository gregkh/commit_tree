iio: accel: st_sensors: Support generic mounting matrix

The ST accelerators support a special type of quirky mounting matrix found
in ACPI systems, but not a generic mounting matrix such as from the device
tree.

Augment the ACPI hack to be a bit more generic and accept a mounting
matrix from device properties.

This makes it possible to fix orientation on the Ux500 HREF device.
