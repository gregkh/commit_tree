drm/bridge/sii8620: fix dependency on extcon

The DRM_SIL_SII8620 kconfig has a weak `imply` dependency
on EXTCON, which causes issues when sii8620 is built
as a builtin and EXTCON is built as a module.

The symptoms are 'undefined reference' errors caused
by the symbols in EXTCON not being available
to the sii8620 driver.
