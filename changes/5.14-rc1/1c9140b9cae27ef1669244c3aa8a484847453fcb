ALSA: rme32: Fix assignment in if condition

PCI RME32 driver code contains a few assignments in if condition,
which is a bad coding style that may confuse readers and occasionally
lead to bugs.

This patch is merely for coding-style fixes (except for a slight
refactoring about AutoSync rate check, only systematic conversions),
no functional changes.
