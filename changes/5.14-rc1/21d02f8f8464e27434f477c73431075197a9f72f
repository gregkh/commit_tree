mm/page_alloc: move free_the_page

Patch series "Allow high order pages to be stored on PCP", v2.

The per-cpu page allocator (PCP) only handles order-0 pages.  With the
series "Use local_lock for pcp protection and reduce stat overhead" and
"Calculate pcp->high based on zone sizes and active CPUs", it's now
feasible to store high-order pages on PCP lists.

This small series allows PCP to store "cheap" orders where cheap is
determined by PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER and THP-sized allocations.

This patch (of 2):

In the next page, free_compount_page is going to use the common helper
free_the_page.  This patch moves the definition to ease review.  No
functional change.
