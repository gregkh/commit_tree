nfc: pn533: drop of_match_ptr from device ID table

The driver can match only via the DT table so the table should be always
used and the of_match_ptr does not have any sense (this also allows ACPI
matching via PRP0001, even though it might be not relevant here).  This
fixes compile warning (!CONFIG_OF):

    drivers/nfc/pn533/i2c.c:252:34: warning:
      ‘of_pn533_i2c_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
