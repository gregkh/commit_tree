locking/atomic: hexagon: move to ARCH_ATOMIC

We'd like all architectures to convert to ARCH_ATOMIC, as once all
architectures are converted it will be possible to make significant
cleanups to the atomics headers, and this will make it much easier to
generically enable atomic functionality (e.g. debug logic in the
instrumented wrappers).

As a step towards that, this patch migrates hexagon to ARCH_ATOMIC. The
arch code provides arch_{atomic,atomic64,xchg,cmpxchg}*(), and common
code wraps these with optional instrumentation to provide the regular
functions.
