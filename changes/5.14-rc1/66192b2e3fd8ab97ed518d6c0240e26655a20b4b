crypto: hisilicon/sec - fix the process of disabling sva prefetching

The open interface of the sva prefetching function is distinguish the chip
version. But the close interface of the sva prefetching function doesn't
distinguish the chip version. As a result, the sva prefetching close
operation is also performed on Kunpeng920, those registers are important
on Kunpeng920, which eventually leads to abnormal hardware problems. So
need to fix it immediately.
