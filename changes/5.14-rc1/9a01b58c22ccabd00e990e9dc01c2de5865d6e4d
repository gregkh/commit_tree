nvmet: add nvmet_req_bio put helper for backends

In current code there exists two backends which are using inline bio
optimization, that adds a duplicate code for freeing the bio.

For Zoned Block Device backend we also use the same optimzation and it
will lead to having duplicate code in the three backends: generic
bdev, passsthru, and generic zns.

Add a helper function to avoid duplicate code and update the respective
backends.
