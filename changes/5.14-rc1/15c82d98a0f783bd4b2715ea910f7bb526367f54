selftests/x86/syscall: Update and extend syscall_numbering_64

Update the syscall_numbering_64 selftest to reflect that a system call is
to be extended from 32 bits. Add a mix of tests for valid and invalid
system calls in 64-bit and x32 space.

Use an explicit system call instruction, because the glibc syscall()
wrapper might intercept instructions, extend the system call number
independently, or anything similar.

Use long long instead of long to make it possible to compile this test
on x32 as well as 64 bits.
