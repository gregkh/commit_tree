scsi: ufs: core: Introduce HBA performance monitor sysfs nodes

Add a new sysfs group which has nodes to monitor data/request transfer
performance. This sysfs group has nodes showing total sectors/requests
transferred, total busy time spent and max/min/avg/sum latencies. This
group can be enhanced later to show more UFS driver layer performance
statistics data during runtime.
