docs: hwmon: ir36021.rst: replace some characters

The conversion tools used during DocBook/LaTeX/html/Markdown->ReST
conversion and some cut-and-pasted text contain some characters that
aren't easily reachable on standard keyboards and/or could cause
troubles when parsed by the documentation build system.

Replace the occurences of the following characters:

	- U+2010 ('‚Äê'): HYPHEN
	  as ASCII HYPHEN is preferred over U+2010
