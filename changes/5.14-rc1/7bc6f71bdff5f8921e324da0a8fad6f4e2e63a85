powerpc/vas: Define and use common vas_window struct

Many elements in vas_struct are used on PowerNV and PowerVM
platforms. vas_window is used for both TX and RX windows on
PowerNV and for TX windows on PowerVM. So some elements are
specific to these platforms.

So this patch defines common vas_window and platform
specific window structs (pnv_vas_window on PowerNV). Also adds
the corresponding changes in PowerNV vas code.
