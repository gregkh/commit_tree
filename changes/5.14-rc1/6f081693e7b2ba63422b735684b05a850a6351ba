sunrpc: remove an offlined xprt using sysfs

Once a transport has been put offline, this transport can be also
removed from the list of transports. Any tasks that have been stuck
on this transport would find the next available active transport
and be re-tried. This transport would be removed from the xprt_switch
list and freed.
