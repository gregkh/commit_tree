platform/surface: aggregator_cdev: Add support for forwarding events to user-space

Currently, debugging unknown events requires writing a custom driver.
This is somewhat difficult, slow to adapt, and not entirely
user-friendly for quickly trying to figure out things on devices of some
third-party user. We can do better. We already have a user-space
interface intended for debugging SAM EC requests, so let's add support
for receiving events to that.

This commit provides support for receiving events by reading from the
controller file. It additionally introduces two new IOCTLs to control
which event categories will be forwarded. Specifically, a user-space
client can specify which target categories it wants to receive events
from by registering the corresponding notifier(s) via the IOCTLs and
after that, read the received events by reading from the controller
device.
