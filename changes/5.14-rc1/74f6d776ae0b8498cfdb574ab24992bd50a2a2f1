iommu/vt-d: Removed unused iommu_count in dmar domain

DMAR domain uses per DMAR refcount. It is indexed by iommu seq_id.
Older iommu_count is only incremented and decremented but no decisions
are taken based on this refcount. This is not of much use.

Hence, remove iommu_count and further simplify domain_detach_iommu()
by returning void.
