media: staging: media: atomisp: pci: Balance braces around conditional statements in file atomisp_cmd.c

Balance braces around conditional statements.
Issue detected by checkpatch.pl.
It happens in if-else statements where one of the commands
uses braces around a block of code and the other command
does not since it has just a single line of code.
