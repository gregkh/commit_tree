SUNRPC: take a xprt offline using sysfs

Using sysfs's xprt_state attribute, mark a particular transport offline.
It will not be picked during the round-robin selection. It's not allowed
to take the main (1st created transport associated with the rpc_client)
offline. Also bring a transport back online via sysfs by writing "online"
and that would allow for this transport to be picked during the round-
robin selection.
