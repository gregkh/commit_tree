powerpc/papr_scm: Make 'perf_stats' invisible if perf-stats unavailable

In case performance stats for an nvdimm are not available, reading the
'perf_stats' sysfs file returns an -ENOENT error. A better approach is
to make the 'perf_stats' file entirely invisible to indicate that
performance stats for an nvdimm are unavailable.

So this patch updates 'papr_nd_attribute_group' to add a 'is_visible'
callback implemented as newly introduced 'papr_nd_attribute_visible()'
that returns an appropriate mode in case performance stats aren't
supported in a given nvdimm.

Also the initialization of 'papr_scm_priv.stat_buffer_len' is moved
from papr_scm_nvdimm_init() to papr_scm_probe() so that it value is
available when 'papr_nd_attribute_visible()' is called during nvdimm
initialization.

Even though 'perf_stats' attribute is available since v5.9, there are
no known user-space tools/scripts that are dependent on presence of its
sysfs file. Hence I dont expect any user-space breakage with this
patch.
