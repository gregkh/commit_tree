usb: musb: Check devctl status again for a spurious session request

On start-up, we can get a spurious session request interrupt with nothing
connected. After that the devctl session bit will silently clear, but the
musb hardware is never idled until a cable is plugged in, or the glue
layer module is reloaded.

Let's just check the session bit again in 3 seconds in peripheral mode
to catch the issue.
