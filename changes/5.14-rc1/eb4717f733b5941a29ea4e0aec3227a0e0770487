perf probe: Fix debuginfo__new() to enable build-id based debuginfo

Fix debuginfo__new() to set the build-id to dso before
dso__read_binary_type_filename() so that it can find
DSO_BINARY_TYPE__BUILDID_DEBUGINFO debuginfo correctly.

However, this may not change the result, because elfutils (libdwfl) has
its own debuginfo finder. With/without this patch, the perf probe
correctly find the debuginfo file.

This is just a failsafe and keep code's sanity (if you use
dso__read_binary_type_filename(), you must set the build-id to the dso.)
