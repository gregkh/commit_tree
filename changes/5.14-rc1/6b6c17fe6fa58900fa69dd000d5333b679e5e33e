ALSA: bebob: fix rx packet format for Yamaha GO44/GO46, Terratec Phase 24/x24

Below devices reports zero as the number of channels for external output
plug with MIDI type:

 * Yamaha GO44/GO46
 * Terratec Phase 24/X24

As a result, rx packet format is invalid and they generate silent sound.
This is a regression added in v5.13.

This commit fixes the bug, addressed at a commit 1bd1b3be8655 ("ALSA:
bebob: perform sequence replay for media clock recovery").
