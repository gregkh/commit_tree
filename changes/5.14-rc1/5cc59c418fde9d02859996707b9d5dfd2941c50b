USB: core: WARN if pipe direction != setup packet direction

When a control URB is submitted, the direction indicated by URB's pipe
member is supposed to match the direction indicated by the setup
packet's bRequestType member.  A mismatch could lead to trouble,
depending on which field the host controller drivers use for
determining the actual direction.

This shouldn't ever happen; it would represent a careless bug in a
kernel driver somewhere.  This patch adds a dev_WARN_ONCE to let
people know about the potential problem.
