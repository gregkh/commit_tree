remoteproc: core: Fix cdev remove and rproc del

The rproc_char_device_remove() call currently unmaps the cdev
region instead of simply deleting the cdev that was added as a
part of the rproc_char_device_add() call. This change fixes that
behaviour, and also fixes the order in which device_del() and
cdev_del() need to be called.
