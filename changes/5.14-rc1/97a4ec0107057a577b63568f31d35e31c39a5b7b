ice: (re)initialize NVM fields when rebuilding

After performing a flash update, a device EMP reset may occur. This
reset will cause the newly downloaded firmware to be initialized. When
this happens, the driver still reports the previous NVM version
information.

This is because the NVM versions are cached within the hw structure.
This can be confusing, as the new firmware is in fact running in this
case.

Handle this by calling ice_init_nvm when rebuilding the driver state.
This will update the flash version information and ensures that the
current values are displayed when reporting the NVM versions to the
stack.
