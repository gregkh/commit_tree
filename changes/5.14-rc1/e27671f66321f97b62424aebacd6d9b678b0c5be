dt-bindings: serial: Add label property in serial.yaml

When there is more than one serial port present, the property 'label'
allows a custom name to be used for briefly describe the usage or position
of each serial port.

Without this "label" property, many dtbs_check warnings similar to the
following are reported:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/hisilicon/hi3660-hikey960.dt.yaml: \
serial@ffd74000: Additional properties are not allowed ('label' was unexpected)
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/pl011.yaml
