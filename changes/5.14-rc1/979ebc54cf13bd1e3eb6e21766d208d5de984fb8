ath11k: send beacon template after vdev_start/restart during csa

Firmware has added assert if beacon template is received after
vdev_down. Firmware expects beacon template after vdev_start
and before vdev_up. This change is needed to support MBSSID EMA
cases in firmware.

Hence, Change the sequence in ath11k as expected from firmware.
This new change is not causing any issues with older
firmware.
