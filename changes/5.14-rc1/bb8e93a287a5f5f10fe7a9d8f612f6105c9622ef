arm64: entry: convert SError handlers to C

For various reasons we'd like to convert the bulk of arm64's exception
triage logic to C. As a step towards that, this patch converts the EL1
and EL0 SError triage logic to C.

Separate C functions are added for the native and compat cases so that
in subsequent patches we can handle native/compat differences in C.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
