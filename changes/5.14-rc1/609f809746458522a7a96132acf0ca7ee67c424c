kcsan: Remove kcsan_report_type

Now that the reporting code has been refactored, it's clear by
construction that print_report() can only be passed
KCSAN_REPORT_RACE_SIGNAL or KCSAN_REPORT_RACE_UNKNOWN_ORIGIN, and these
can also be distinguished by the presence of `other_info`.

Let's simplify things and remove the report type enum, and instead let's
check `other_info` to distinguish these cases. This allows us to remove
code for cases which are impossible and generally makes the code simpler.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
