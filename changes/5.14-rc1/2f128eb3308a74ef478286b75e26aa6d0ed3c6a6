mvpp2: prefetch page

Most of the time during the RX is caused by the compound_head() call
done at the end of the RX loop:

       │     build_skb():
       [...]
       │     static inline struct page *compound_head(struct page *page)
       │     {
       │     unsigned long head = READ_ONCE(page->compound_head);
 65.23 │       ldr  x2, [x1, #8]

Prefetch the page struct as soon as possible, to speedup the RX path
noticeabily by a ~3-4% packet rate in a drop test.

       │     build_skb():
       [...]
       │     static inline struct page *compound_head(struct page *page)
       │     {
       │     unsigned long head = READ_ONCE(page->compound_head);
 17.92 │       ldr  x2, [x1, #8]
