fs: dlm: add midcomms debugfs functionality

This patch adds functionality to debug midcomms per connection state
inside a comms directory which is similar like dlm configfs. Currently
there exists the possibility to read out two attributes which is the
send queue counter and the version of each midcomms node state.
