Revert "USB: Add reset-resume quirk for WD19's Realtek Hub"

This reverts commit ca91fd8c7643 ("USB: Add reset-resume quirk for
WD19's Realtek Hub"). The previous patch in the series now handles
the problematic hubs by checking the port status and handling it
accordingly when PORT_SUSPEND timeout occurs. We don't need to use
reset-resume all the time.
