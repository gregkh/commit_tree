KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Move setting HDEC after switching to guest LPCR

LPCR[HDICE]=0 suppresses hypervisor decrementer exceptions on some
processors, so it must be enabled before HDEC is set.

Rather than set it in the host LPCR then setting HDEC, move the HDEC
update to after the guest MMU context (including LPCR) is loaded.
There shouldn't be much concern with delaying HDEC by some 10s or 100s
of nanoseconds by setting it a bit later.
