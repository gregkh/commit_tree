scsi: message: fusion: Remove redundant assignment to rc

Variable rc is set to '-1', but this value is never read as it is
overwritten later. Hence it is a redundant assignment and can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c:6996:2: warning: Value stored to 'rc'
is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
