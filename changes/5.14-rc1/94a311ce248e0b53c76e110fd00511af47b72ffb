x86/MCE/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Add new SMCA bank types

Add the (HWID, MCATYPE) tuples and names for new SMCA bank types.

Also, add their respective error descriptions to the MCE decoding module
edac_mce_amd. Also while at it, optimize the string names for some SMCA
banks.

 [ bp: Drop repeated comments, explain why UMC_V2 is a separate entry. ]
