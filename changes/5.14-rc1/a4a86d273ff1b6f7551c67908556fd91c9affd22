phy: phy-can-transceiver: Add support for generic CAN transceiver driver

The driver adds support for generic CAN transceivers. Currently
the modes supported by this driver are standby and normal modes for TI
TCAN1042 and TCAN1043 CAN transceivers.

The transceiver is modelled as a phy with pins controlled by gpios, to put
the transceiver in various device functional modes. It also gets the phy
attribute max_link_rate for the usage of CAN drivers.
