net: dsa: reference count the FDB addresses at the cross-chip notifier level

The same concerns expressed for host MDB entries are valid for host FDBs
just as well:

- in the case of multiple bridges spanning the same switch chip, deleting
  a host FDB entry that belongs to one bridge will result in breakage to
  the other bridge
- not deleting FDB entries across DSA links means that the switch's
  hardware tables will eventually run out, given enough wear&tear

So do the same thing and introduce reference counting for CPU ports and
DSA links using the same data structures as we have for MDB entries.
