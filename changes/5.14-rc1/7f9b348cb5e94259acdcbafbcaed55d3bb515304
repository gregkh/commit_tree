brd: convert to blk_alloc_disk/blk_cleanup_disk

Convert the brd driver to use the blk_alloc_disk and blk_cleanup_disk
helpers to simplify gendisk and request_queue allocation.  This also
allows to remove the request_queue pointer in struct request_queue,
and to simplify the initialization as blk_cleanup_disk can be called
on any disk returned from blk_alloc_disk.
