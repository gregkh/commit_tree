can: uapi: update CAN-FD frame description

Since an early version of the CAN-FD specification the bit that
defines a CAN-FD frame on the wire, has been renamed from Extended
Data Length (EDL) to FD Frame (FDF).

To avoid confusion, update the struct canfd_frame description in the
UAPI headers accordingly.
