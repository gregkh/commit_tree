nfc: fdp: drop ftrace-like debugging messages

Now that the kernel has ftrace, any debugging calls that just do "made
it to this function!" and "leaving this function!" can be removed.
Better to use standard debugging tools.

This allows also to remove several local variables and entire
fdp_nci_recv_frame() function (whose purpose was only to log).
