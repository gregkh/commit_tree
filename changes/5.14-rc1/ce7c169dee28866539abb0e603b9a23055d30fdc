rcu: Remove the unused rcu_irq_exit_preempt() function

Commit 9ee01e0f69a9 ("x86/entry: Clean up idtentry_enter/exit()
leftovers") left the rcu_irq_exit_preempt() in place in order to avoid
conflicts with the -rcu tree.  Now that this change has long since hit
mainline, this commit removes the no-longer-used rcu_irq_exit_preempt()
function.
