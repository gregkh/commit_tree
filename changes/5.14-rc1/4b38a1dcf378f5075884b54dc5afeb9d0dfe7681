platform/surface: aggregator: Allow enabling of events without notifiers

We can already enable and disable SAM events via one of two ways: either
via a (non-observer) notifier tied to a specific event group, or a
generic event enable/disable request. In some instances, however,
neither method may be desirable.

The first method will tie the event enable request to a specific
notifier, however, when we want to receive notifications for multiple
event groups of the same target category and forward this to the same
notifier callback, we may receive duplicate events, i.e. one event per
registered notifier. The second method will bypass the internal
reference counting mechanism, meaning that a disable request will
disable the event regardless of any other client driver using it, which
may break the functionality of that driver.

To address this problem, add new functions that allow enabling and
disabling of events via the event reference counting mechanism built
into the controller, without needing to register a notifier.

This can then be used in combination with observer notifiers to process
multiple events of the same target category without duplication in the
same callback function.
