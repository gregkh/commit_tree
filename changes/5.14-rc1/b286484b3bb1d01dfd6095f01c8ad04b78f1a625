mxser: introduce mxser_must_select_bank and use it

Again, selecting a bank in the EFR register is duplicated many times.
Extract it to a separate function (mxser_must_select_bank) and use it on
all the places.

This cleans up most of the helpers. And mxser_get_must_hardware_id now
returns the HW ID directly, not via a by-reference parameter.
