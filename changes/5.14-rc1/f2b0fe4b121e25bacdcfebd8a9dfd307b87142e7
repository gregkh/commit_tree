dt-bindings: serial: pl011: Delete an incorrect compatible string

The compatible strings "zte,zx296702-uart" and "arm,primecell" are a
combination, but commit 89d4f98ae90d ("ARM: remove zte zx platform")
removes only the former. It is incorrect to match driver pl011 based only
on the remaining "arm,primecell". Delete it.
