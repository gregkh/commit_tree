RDMA/core: Sanitize WQ state received from the userspace

The mlx4 and mlx5 implemented differently the WQ input checks.  Instead of
duplicating mlx4 logic in the mlx5, let's prepare the input in the central
place.

The mlx5 implementation didn't check for validity of state input.  It is
not real bug because our FW checked that, but still worth to fix.
