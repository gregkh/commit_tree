KVM: x86/mmu: Add a field to control memslot rmap allocation

Add a field to control whether new memslots should have rmaps allocated
for them. As of this change, it's not safe to skip allocating rmaps, so
the field is always set to allocate rmaps. Future changes will make it
safe to operate without rmaps, using the TDP MMU. Then further changes
will allow the rmaps to be allocated lazily when needed for nested
oprtation.

No functional change expected.
