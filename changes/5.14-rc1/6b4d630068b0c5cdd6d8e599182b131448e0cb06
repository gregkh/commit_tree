powerpc/32s: Allow disabling KUAP at boot time

PPC64 uses MMU features to enable/disable KUAP at boot time.
But feature fixups are applied way too early on PPC32.

Now that all KUAP related actions are in C following the
conversion of KUAP initial setup and context switch in C,
static branches can be used to enable/disable KUAP.
