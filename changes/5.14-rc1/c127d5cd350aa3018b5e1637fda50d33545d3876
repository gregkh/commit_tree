ALSA: oxfw: code refactoring for existent device entry with specifier_id and version

All of the devices known to be based on OXFW ASICs have the same layout
of configuration ROM, in which unit directory includes vendor, model,
specifier_id and version immediate values. Especially, the pair of
specifier_id and version is fixed to represent AV/C general protocol.

This commit refactors device entries to fulfil with these 4 elements.
