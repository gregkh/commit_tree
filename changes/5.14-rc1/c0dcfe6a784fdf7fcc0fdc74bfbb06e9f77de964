arm64: dts: qcom: c630: Add no-hpd to DSI bridge node

We should indicate that we're not using the HPD pin on this device, per
the binding document. Otherwise if code in the future wants to enable
HPD in the bridge when this property is absent we'll be enabling HPD
when it isn't supposed to be used. Presumably this board isn't using hpd
on the bridge.
