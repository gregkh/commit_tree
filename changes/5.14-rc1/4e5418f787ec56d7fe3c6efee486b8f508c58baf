hwmon: (pmbus_core) Check adapter PEC support

Currently, for Packet Error Checking (PEC) only the controller
is checked for support. This causes problems on the cisco-8000
platform where a SMBUS transaction errors are observed. This is
because PEC has to be enabled only if both controller and
adapter support it.

Added code to check PEC capability for adapter and enable it
only if both controller and adapter supports PEC.
