arm64/mm: Remove [PUD|PMD]_TABLE_BIT from [pud|pmd]_bad()

Semantics wise, [pud|pmd]_bad() have always implied that a given [PUD|PMD]
entry does not have a pointer to the next level page table. This had been
made clear in the commit a1c76574f345 ("arm64: mm: use *_sect to check for
section maps"). Hence explicitly check for a table entry rather than just
testing a single bit. This basically redefines [pud|pmd]_bad() in terms of
[pud|pmd]_table() making the semantics clear.
