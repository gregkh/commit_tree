Bluetooth: Translate additional address type during le_conn_comp

When using controller based address resolution, then the destination
address type during le_conn_complete uses 0x02 & 0x03 if controller
resolves the destination address(RPA).
These address types need to be converted back into either 0x00 0r 0x01
