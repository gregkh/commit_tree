ASoC: topology: Add support for multiple kcontrol types to a widget

Current dapm widget has a single variable to describe its kcontrol's
type. As there can be many kcontrols in one widget it is inherently
presumed that the types are the same.

Lately there has been use cases where different types of kcontrols would
be needed for a single widget. Thus add pointer to dapm widget to hold
an array for different kcontrol types and modify the kcontrol creation
to operate in a loop based on individual kcontrol type.

Change control creation and deletion to use individual kcontrol types in
SOF driver. This is done in the same patch for not breaking bisect. SOF
driver is also currently the only one using the dapm widget
kcontrol_type.
