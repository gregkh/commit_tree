ALSA: firewire-lib: add flag to unaware of syt in CIP header

Many devices are unaware of syt field in rx CIP for playback timing.

This commit adds a flag to cancel processing syt field. Actually,
syt calculation is required to decide the number of events per rx packet.
The flag put 0xffff to CIP header of rx packet. On the other hand,
The value of syt field in CIP header of tx packet is unavailable. The
sequence of packet descriptor for tx packet includes 0 for the offset
of syt field to avoid computation.
