iio: adc: ad7192: use devm_clk_get_optional() for mclk

The devm_clk_get_optional() helper returns NULL when devm_clk_get() returns
-ENOENT.
This makes things slightly cleaner. The added benefit is mostly cosmetic.

Also, a minor detail with this call, is that the reference for the parent
device is taken as `spi->dev` instead of `&st->sd.spi->dev` (which looks a
little quirky).
