nfsd: Reduce contention for the nfsd_file nf_rwsem

When flushing out the unstable file writes as part of a COMMIT call, try
to perform most of of the data writes and waits outside the semaphore.

This means that if the client is sending the COMMIT as part of a memory
reclaim operation, then it can continue performing I/O, with contention
for the lock occurring only once the data sync is finished.
