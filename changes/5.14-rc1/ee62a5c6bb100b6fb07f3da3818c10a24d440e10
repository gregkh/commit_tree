libbpf: Switch to void * casting in netlink helpers

Netlink helpers I added in 8bbb77b7c7a2 ("libbpf: Add various netlink
helpers") used char * casts everywhere, and there were a few more that
existed from before.

Convert all of them to void * cast, as it is treated equivalently by
clang/gcc for the purposes of pointer arithmetic and to follow the
convention elsewhere in the kernel/libbpf.
