selftests/bpf: Add bpf_lookup_and_delete_elem tests

Add bpf selftests and extend existing ones for a new function
bpf_lookup_and_delete_elem() for (percpu) hash and (percpu) LRU hash map
types.
In test_lru_map and test_maps we add an element, lookup_and_delete it,
then check whether it's deleted.
The newly added lookup_and_delete prog tests practically do the same
thing but additionally use a BPF program to change the value of the
element for LRU maps.
