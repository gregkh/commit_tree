regulator: bd9576: Fix uninitializes variable may_have_irqs

The boolean variable may_have_irqs is not ininitialized and is
only being set to true in the case where chip is ROHM_CHIP_TYPE_BD9576.
Fix this by ininitialized may_have_irqs to false.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
