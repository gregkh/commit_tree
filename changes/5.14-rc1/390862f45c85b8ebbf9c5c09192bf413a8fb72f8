bnxt_en: Get the full 48-bit hardware timestamp periodically

From the bnxt_timer(), read the 48-bit hardware running clock
periodically and store it in ptp->current_time.  The previous snapshot
of the clock will be stored in ptp->old_time.  The old_time snapshot
will be used in the next patches to compute the RX packet timestamps.

v2: Use .do_aux_work() to read the timer periodically.
