staging: mt7621-pci: remove 'mt7621_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges'

After 'PCI_IOBASE' is defined for ralink, ranges are properly parsed
using pci generic APIS and there is no need to parse anything
manually. So function 'mt7621_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges'
used for this can be enterely removed. Since we have to configure
iocu memory regions and pci io windows resources must be retrieved
accordly from 'bridge->windows' but there is no need to store
anything as driver private data.
