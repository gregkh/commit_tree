xfs: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix
the following warnings by replacing /* fall through */ comments,
and its variants, with the new pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough:

fs/xfs/scrub/agheader.c:89:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings, so in order to globally enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, these comments need to be
replaced with fallthrough; in the whole codebase.
