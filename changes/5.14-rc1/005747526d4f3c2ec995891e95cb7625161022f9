docs: fault-injection: fix non-working usage of negative values

Fault injection uses debugfs in a way that the provided values via sysfs
are interpreted as u64. Providing negative numbers results in an error:

/sys/kernel/debug/fail_function# echo -1 > times
sh: write error: Invalid argument

Update the docs and examples to use "printf %#x <val>" in these cases.
For "retval", reword the paragraph a little and fix a typo.
