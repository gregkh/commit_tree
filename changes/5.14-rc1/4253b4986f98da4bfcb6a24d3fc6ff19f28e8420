ipv4: Add custom multipath hash policy

Add a new multipath hash policy where the packet fields used for hash
calculation are determined by user space via the
fib_multipath_hash_fields sysctl that was introduced in the previous
patch.

The current set of available packet fields includes both outer and inner
fields, which requires two invocations of the flow dissector. Avoid
unnecessary dissection of the outer or inner flows by skipping
dissection if none of the outer or inner fields are required.

In accordance with the existing policies, when an skb is not available,
packet fields are extracted from the provided flow key. In which case,
only outer fields are considered.
