drm/i915/debugfs: Print remap info for DPT VMAs as well

Similarly to GGTT VMAs, DPT VMAs can be also a remapped or rotated view
of the mapped object, so make sure we debug print the details for these
views as well besides the normal view.

While at it also fix the debug print for the VMA type of DPT VMAs.
