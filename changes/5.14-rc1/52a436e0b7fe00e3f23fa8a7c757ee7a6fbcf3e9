clk: qcom: smd-rpm: Switch to parent_data

Switch to parent_data and with that fix the longstanding issue where
if there wasn't a clock precisely named "xo_board", rpmcc would not play
along well. This started to show lately when "xo_board" was being changed to
"xo-board" so as to align with DTS naming spec.
