arm64: Document requirement for access to FEAT_HCX

v8.7 of the architecture introduced FEAT_HCX which adds an additional
hypervisor configuration register HCRX_EL2. Even though Linux does not
currently make use of this feature let's document that the EL3 trap for
access to the register should be disabled so that we are able to make
use of it in future.
