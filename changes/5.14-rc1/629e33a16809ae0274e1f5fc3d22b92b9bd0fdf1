btrfs: remove unused btrfs_fs_info::total_pinned

This got added 14 years ago in 324ae4df00fd ("Btrfs: Add block group
pinned accounting back") but it was not ever used. Subsequently its
usage got gradually removed in 8790d502e440 ("Btrfs: Add support for
mirroring across drives") and 11833d66be94 ("Btrfs: improve async block
group caching"). Let's remove it for good!
