wcn36xx: Move hal_buf allocation to devm_kmalloc in probe

Right now wcn->hal_buf is allocated in wcn36xx_start(). This is a problem
since we should have setup all of the buffers we required by the time
ieee80211_register_hw() is called.

struct ieee80211_ops callbacks may run prior to mac_start() and therefore
wcn->hal_buf must be initialized.

This is easily remediated by moving the allocation to probe() taking the
opportunity to tidy up freeing memory by using devm_kmalloc().
