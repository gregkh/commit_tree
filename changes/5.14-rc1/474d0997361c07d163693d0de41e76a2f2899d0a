tasks-rcu: Make show_rcu_tasks_gp_kthreads() be static inline

In some architectures, the no-op variant of show_rcu_tasks_gp_kthreads()
get "no previous prototype" compiler warnings.  These are false positives
given that kernel/rcu/tasks.h is included only once.  But why put up
with the compiler noise?

This commit therefore adds "static inline" to this definition to force
the compiler to accept this situation, while also moving it to its proper
place in kernel/rcu/rcu.h.
