serial: 8250: Use 'hlist_for_each_entry' to simplify code

Use 'hlist_for_each_entry' instead of hand writing it.
This saves a few lines of code.

The comment about warning generated by some gcc version is also removed.
The way 'hlist_for_each_entry' is written should prevent such a warning to
be emitted.
