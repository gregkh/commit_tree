tools headers UAPI: Sync files changed by the quotactl_fd new syscall

To pick the changes in these csets:

  64c2c2c62f92339b ("quota: Change quotactl_path() systcall to an fd-based one")
  65ffb3d69ed3da28 ("quota: Wire up quotactl_fd syscall")

That silences these perf build warnings and add support for those new
syscalls in tools such as 'perf trace'.

For instance, this is now possible:

  # perf trace -v -e quota*
  event qualifier tracepoint filter: (common_pid != 158365 && common_pid != 2512) && (id == 179 || id == 443)
  ^C#

That is the filter expression attached to the raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}
tracepoints.

  $ grep quota tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
  179	common	quotactl		sys_quotactl
  443	common	quotactl_fd		sys_quotactl_fd
  $

This addresses these perf build warnings:
