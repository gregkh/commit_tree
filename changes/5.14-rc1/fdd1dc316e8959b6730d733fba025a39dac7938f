io_uring: Fix incorrect sizeof operator for copy_from_user call

Static analysis is warning that the sizeof being used is should be
of *data->tags[i] and not data->tags[i]. Although these are the same
size on 64 bit systems it is not a portable assumption to assume
this is true for all cases.  Fix this by using a temporary pointer
tag_slot to make the code a clearer.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Sizeof not portable")
