ubifs: Remove ui_mutex in ubifs_xattr_get and change_xattr

Since ubifs_xattr_get and ubifs_xattr_set cannot being executed
parallelly after importing @host_ui->xattr_sem, now we can remove
ui_mutex imported by commit ab92a20bce3b4c2 ("ubifs: make
ubifs_[get|set]xattr atomic").

@xattr_size, @xattr_names and @xattr_cnt can't be out of protection
by @host_ui->mutex yet, they are sill accesed in other places, such as
pack_inode() called by ubifs_write_inode() triggered by page-writeback.
