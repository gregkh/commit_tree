powerpc/pseries: break early in dlpar_memory_remove_by_count() loops

After marking the LMBs as reserved depending on dlpar_remove_lmb() rc,
we evaluate whether we need to add the LMBs back or if we can release
the LMB DRCs. In both cases, a for_each_drmem_lmb() loop without a break
condition is used. This means that we're going to cycle through all LMBs
of the partition even after we're done with what we were going to do.

This patch adds break conditions in both loops to avoid this. The
'lmbs_removed' variable was renamed to 'lmbs_reserved', and it's now
being decremented each time a lmb reservation is removed, indicating
that the operation we're doing (adding back LMBs or releasing DRCs) is
completed.
