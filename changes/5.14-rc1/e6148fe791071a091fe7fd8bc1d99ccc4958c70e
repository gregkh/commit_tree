iio: accel: bmc150: Set label based on accel-location for ACPI DUAL250E fwnodes

Some Yoga laptops with 1 accelerometer in the display and 1 in the base,
use an ACPI HID of DUAL250E instead of BOSC0200.

Set the iio-device's label for DUAL250E devices to a value indicating which
sensor is which, mirroring how we do this for BOSC0200 dual sensor devices.

Note the DUAL250E fwnode unfortunately does not include a mount-matrix.
