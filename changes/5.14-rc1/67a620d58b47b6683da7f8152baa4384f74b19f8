n_tty: move lnext handling

Move lnext handling from __receive_buf to n_tty_receive_buf_standard. It
simplifies the handling as it needs not fetching 'flag' and decrement
'count' in __receive_buf. Instead, all this is left up to the loop in
n_tty_receive_buf_standard which already does that.

This way, no need to repeat the action when n_tty_receive_char_special
returns true -- ldata->lnext is set there in that case, so the 'if
(ldata->lnext)' check is sufficient. The next patch will switch
n_tty_receive_char_special to return 'void'.

The result is much simplified code flow.
