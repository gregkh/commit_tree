spi: Allow to have all native CSs in use along with GPIOs

The commit 7d93aecdb58d ("spi: Add generic support for unused native cs
with cs-gpios") excludes the valid case for the controllers that doesn't
need to switch native CS in order to perform the transfer, i.e. when

  0		native
  ...		...
  <n> - 1	native
  <n>		GPIO
  <n> + 1	GPIO
  ...		...

where <n> defines maximum of native CSs supported by the controller.

To allow this, bail out from spi_get_gpio_descs() conditionally for
the controllers which explicitly marked with SPI_MASTER_GPIO_SS.
