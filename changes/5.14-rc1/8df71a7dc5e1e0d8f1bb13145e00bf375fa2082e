cpufreq: intel_pstate: hybrid: Fix build with CONFIG_ACPI unset

One of the previous commits introducing hybrid processor support to
intel_pstate broke build with CONFIG_ACPI unset.

Fix that and while at it make empty stubs of two functions related
to ACPI CPPC static inline and fix a spelling mistake in the name of
one of them.
