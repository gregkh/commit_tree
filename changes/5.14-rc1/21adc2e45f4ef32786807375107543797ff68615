mmc: Improve function name when aborting a tuning cmd

'mmc_abort_tuning()' made me think tuning gets completely aborted.
However, it sends only a STOP cmd to cancel the current tuning cmd.
Tuning process may still continue after that. So, rename the function to
'mmc_send_abort_tuning()' to better reflect all this.
