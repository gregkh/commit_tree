mm/huge_memory.c: don't discard hugepage if other processes are mapping it

If other processes are mapping any other subpages of the hugepage, i.e.
in pte-mapped thp case, page_mapcount() will return 1 incorrectly.  Then
we would discard the page while other processes are still mapping it.  Fix
it by using total_mapcount() which can tell whether other processes are
still mapping it.
