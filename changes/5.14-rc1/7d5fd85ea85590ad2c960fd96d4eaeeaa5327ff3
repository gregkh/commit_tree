staging: rtl8723bs: rename enum items related to channel bonding

since rtl8723bs card allows only 20Mhz and 40Mhz channels,
rename enum items related to channel bonding accordingly to
the only composite channel bandwidth allowed in 2.4Ghz
(i.e. 40Mhz) in a HT context (since VHT isn't supported)

Example:

VHT_DATA_SC_20_LOWER_OF_80MHZ ->
	HT_DATA_SC_LOWER_OF_40MHZ
