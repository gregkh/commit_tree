mount: Support "nosymfollow" in new mount api

Commit dab741e0e02b ("Add a "nosymfollow" mount option.") added support
for the "nosymfollow" mount option allowing to block following symlinks
when resolving paths. The mount option so far was only available in the
old mount api. Make it available in the new mount api as well. Bonus is
that it can be applied to a whole subtree not just a single mount.
