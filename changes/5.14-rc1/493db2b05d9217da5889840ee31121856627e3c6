memory: pl353-smc: Let lower level controller drivers handle inits

There is no point in having all these definitions at the SMC bus level,
these are extremely tight to the NAND controller driver implementation,
are not particularly generic, imply more boilerplate than needed, do
not really follow the device model by receiving no argument and some of
them are actually buggy.

Let's get rid of these right now as there is no current user and keep
this driver at a simple level: only the SMC bare initializations.

The NAND controller driver which I am going to introduce will take care
of redefining properly all these helpers and using them directly.
