PCI: imx6: Enable PHY internal regulator when supplied >3V

The i.MX8MQ PCIe PHY needs 1.8V in default but can be supplied by either a
1.8V or a 3.3V regulator.

The "vph-supply" DT property tells us which external regulator supplies the
PHY. If that regulator supplies anything over 3V, enable the PHY's internal
3.3V-to-1.8V regulator.
