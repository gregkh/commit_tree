KVM: selftests: Use "standard" min virtual address for Hyper-V pages

Use the de facto standard minimum virtual address for Hyper-V's hcall
params page.  It's the allocator's job to not double-allocate memory,
i.e. there's no reason to force different regions for the params vs.
hcall page.  This will allow adding a page allocation helper with a
"standard" minimum address.
