riscv: Introduce structure that group all variables regarding kernel mapping

We have a lot of variables that are used to hold kernel mapping addresses,
offsets between physical and virtual mappings and some others used for XIP
kernels: they are all defined at different places in mm/init.c, so group
them into a single structure with, for some of them, more explicit and concise
names.
