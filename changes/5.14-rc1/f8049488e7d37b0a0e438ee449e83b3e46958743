arm64: entry: add a call_on_irq_stack helper

When handling IRQ/FIQ exceptions the entry assembly may transition from
a task's stack to a CPU's IRQ stack (and IRQ shadow call stack).

In subsequent patches we want to migrate the IRQ/FIQ triage logic to C,
and as we want to perform some actions on the task stack (e.g. EL1
preemption), we need to switch stacks within the C handler. So that we
can do so, this patch adds a helper to call a function on a CPU's IRQ
stack (and shadow stack as appropriate).

Subsequent patches will make use of the new helper function.
