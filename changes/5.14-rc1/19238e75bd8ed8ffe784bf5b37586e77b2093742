kvm: x86: Allow userspace to handle emulation errors

Add a fallback mechanism to the in-kernel instruction emulator that
allows userspace the opportunity to process an instruction the emulator
was unable to.  When the in-kernel instruction emulator fails to process
an instruction it will either inject a #UD into the guest or exit to
userspace with exit reason KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR.  This is because it does
not know how to proceed in an appropriate manner.  This feature lets
userspace get involved to see if it can figure out a better path
forward.
