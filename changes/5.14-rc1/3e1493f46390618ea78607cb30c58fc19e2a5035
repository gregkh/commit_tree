sched/uclamp: Ignore max aggregation if rq is idle

When a task wakes up on an idle rq, uclamp_rq_util_with() would max
aggregate with rq value. But since there is no task enqueued yet, the
values are stale based on the last task that was running. When the new
task actually wakes up and enqueued, then the rq uclamp values should
reflect that of the newly woken up task effective uclamp values.

This is a problem particularly for uclamp_max because it default to
1024. If a task p with uclamp_max = 512 wakes up, then max aggregation
would ignore the capping that should apply when this task is enqueued,
which is wrong.

Fix that by ignoring max aggregation if the rq is idle since in that
case the effective uclamp value of the rq will be the ones of the task
that will wake up.
