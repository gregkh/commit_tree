ima: Fix warning: no previous prototype for function 'ima_add_kexec_buffer'

The function prototype for ima_add_kexec_buffer() is present
in 'linux/ima.h'.  But this header file is not included in
ima_kexec.c where the function is implemented.  This results
in the following compiler warning when "-Wmissing-prototypes" flag
is turned on:

  security/integrity/ima/ima_kexec.c:81:6: warning: no previous prototype
  for function 'ima_add_kexec_buffer' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

Include the header file 'linux/ima.h' in ima_kexec.c to fix
the compiler warning.
