x86/fpu: Make copy_xstate_to_kernel() usable for [x]fpregs_get()

When xsave with init state optimization is used then a component's state
in the task's xsave buffer can be stale when the corresponding feature bit
is not set.

fpregs_get() and xfpregs_get() invoke fpstate_sanitize_xstate() to update
the task's xsave buffer before retrieving the FX or FP state. That's just
duplicated code as copy_xstate_to_kernel() already handles this correctly.

Add a copy mode argument to the function which allows to restrict the state
copy to the FP and SSE features.

Also rename the function to copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf() so the name reflects
what it is doing.
