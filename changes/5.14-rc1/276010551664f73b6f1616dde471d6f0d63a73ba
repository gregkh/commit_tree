time: Improve performance of time64_to_tm()

The current implementation of time64_to_tm() contains unnecessary loops,
branches and look-up tables. The new one uses an arithmetic-based algorithm
appeared in [1] and is approximately 3x faster (YMMV).

The drawback is that the new code isn't intuitive and contains many 'magic
numbers' (not unusual for this type of algorithm). However, [1] justifies
all those numbers and, given this function's history, the code is unlikely
to need much maintenance, if any at all.

Add a KUnit test for it which checks every day in a 160,000 years interval
centered at 1970-01-01 against the expected result.
