iio: adis16480: support burst read function

Some supported devices support burst read function. This provides a method
for reading a batch of data (status, temperature, gyroscopes,
accelerometers, time stamp/data counter, and CRC code), which does not
require a stall time between each 16-bit segment and only requires one
command on the DIN line to initiate. Devices supporting this mode
are:

 * adis16495-1
 * adis16495-2
 * adis16495-3
 * adis16497-1
 * adis16497-2
 * adis16497-3
