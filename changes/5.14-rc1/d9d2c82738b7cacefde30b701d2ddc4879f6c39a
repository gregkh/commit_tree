docs: filesystems: ext4: blockgroup.rst: replace some characters

The conversion tools used during DocBook/LaTeX/html/Markdown->ReST
conversion and some cut-and-pasted text contain some characters that
aren't easily reachable on standard keyboards and/or could cause
troubles when parsed by the documentation build system.

Replace the occurences of the following characters:

	- U+2217 ('âˆ—'): ASTERISK OPERATOR
	  use ASCII asterisk instead of the ASTERISK OPERATOR
