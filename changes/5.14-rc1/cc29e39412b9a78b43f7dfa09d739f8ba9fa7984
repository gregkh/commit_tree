ARM: dts: exynos: align Broadcom WiFi with dtschema

The Broadcom BCM4329 family dtschema expects devices to be compatible
also with brcm,bcm4329-fmac:

  arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos3250-rinato.dt.yaml: wifi@1: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
    ['brcm,bcm4334-fmac'] is too short
    'brcm,bcm4329-fmac' was expected
