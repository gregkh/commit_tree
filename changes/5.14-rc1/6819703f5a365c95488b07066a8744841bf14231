btrfs: clear defrag status of a root if starting transaction fails

The defrag loop processes leaves in batches and starting transaction for
each. The whole defragmentation on a given root is protected by a bit
but in case the transaction fails, the bit is not cleared

In case the transaction fails the bit would prevent starting
defragmentation again, so make sure it's cleared.
