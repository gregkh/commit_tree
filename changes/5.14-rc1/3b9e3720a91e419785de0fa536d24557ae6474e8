ALSA: usb-audio: scarlett2: Split up sw_hw_enum_ctl_put()

Split part of scarlett2_sw_hw_enum_ctl_put() out into
scarlett2_sw_hw_change() so that the code which actually makes the
change is available in its own function. This will be used by the
speaker switching support which needs to set the SW/HW switch to HW
when speaker switching is enabled.
