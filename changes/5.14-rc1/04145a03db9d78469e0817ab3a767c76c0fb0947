USB: UDC: Implement udc_async_callbacks in dummy-hcd

This patch adds a udc_async_callbacks handler to the dummy-hcd UDC
driver, which will prevent a theoretical race during gadget unbinding.

The implementation is simple, since dummy-hcd already has a flag to
keep track of whether emulated IRQs are enabled.  All the handler has
to do is store the enable value in the flag, and avoid setting the
flag prematurely.
