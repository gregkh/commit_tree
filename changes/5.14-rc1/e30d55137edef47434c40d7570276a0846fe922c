scsi: lpfc: Fix "Unexpected timeout" error in direct attach topology

An 'unexpected timeout' message may be seen in a point-2-point topology.
The message occurs when a PLOGI is received before the driver is notified
of FLOGI completion. The FLOGI completion failure causes discovery to be
triggered for a second time. The discovery timer is restarted but no new
discovery activity is initiated, thus the timeout message eventually
appears.

In point-2-point, when discovery has progressed before the FLOGI completion
is processed, it is not a failure. Add code to FLOGI completion to detect
that discovery has progressed and exit the FLOGI handling (noop'ing it).
