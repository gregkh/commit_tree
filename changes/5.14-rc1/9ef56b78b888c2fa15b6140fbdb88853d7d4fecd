mm: vmscan: remove noinline_for_stack

The noinline_for_stack is introduced by commit 666356297ec4 ("vmscan: set
up pagevec as late as possible in shrink_inactive_list()"), its purpose is
to delay the allocation of pagevec as late as possible to save stack
memory.  But the commit 2bcf88796381 ("mm: take pagevecs off reclaim
stack") replace pagevecs by lists of pages_to_free.  So we do not need
noinline_for_stack, just remove it (let the compiler decide whether to
inline).
