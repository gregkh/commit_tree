nfp: flower-ct: make a full copy of the rule when it is a NFT flow

The nft flow will be destroyed after offload cb returns. This means
we need save a full copy of it since it can be referenced through
other paths other than just the offload cb, for example when a new
pre_ct or post_ct entry is added, and it needs to be merged with
an existing nft entry.
