xfs: change the prefix of XFS_EOF_FLAGS_* to XFS_ICWALK_FLAG_

In preparation for renaming struct xfs_eofblocks to struct xfs_icwalk,
change the prefix of the existing XFS_EOF_FLAGS_* flags to
XFS_ICWALK_FLAG_ and convert all the existing users.  This adds a degree
of interface separation between the ioctl definitions and the incore
parameters.  Since FLAGS_UNION is only used in xfs_icache.c, move it
there as a private flag.
