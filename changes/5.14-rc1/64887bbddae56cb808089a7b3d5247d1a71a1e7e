ACPI: ipmi: Remove address space handler in error path

The acpi_install_address_space_handler() is coupled with
acpi_remove_address_space_handler() in ipmi module init/exit, but
it forgets to remove the handler in acpi_ipmi_init() if the
ipmi_smi_watcher_register() call fails, so add the removal of the
address space handler in error path.
