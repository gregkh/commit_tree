arm64: Change the on_*stack functions to take a size argument

unwind_frame() was previously implicitly checking that the frame
record is in bounds of the stack by enforcing that FP is both aligned
to 16 and in bounds of the stack. Once the FP alignment requirement
is relaxed to 8 this will not be sufficient because it does not
account for the case where FP points to 8 bytes before the end of the
stack.

Make the check explicit by changing the on_*stack functions to take a
size argument and adjusting the callers to pass the appropriate sizes.
