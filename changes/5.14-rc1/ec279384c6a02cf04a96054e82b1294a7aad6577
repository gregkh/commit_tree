drm/i915: Initialize err in remap_io_sg()

If the do while loop breaks in 'if (!sg_dma_len(sgl))' in the first
iteration, err is uninitialized causing a wrong call to zap_vma_ptes().

But that is impossible to happen as a scatterlist must have at least
one valid segment.
Anyways to avoid more reports from static checkers initializing ret
here.
