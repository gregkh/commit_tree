KVM: x86/mmu: Use MMU's role/role_regs to compute context's metadata

Use the MMU's role and role_regs to calculate the MMU's guest root level
and NX bit.  For some flows, the vCPU state may not be correct (or
relevant), e.g. EPT doesn't interact with EFER.NX and nested NPT will
configure the guest_mmu with possibly-stale vCPU state.
