xfs: move the quotaoff dqrele inode walk into xfs_icache.c

The only external caller of xfs_inode_walk* happens in quotaoff, when we
want to walk all the incore inodes to detach the dquots.  Move this code
to xfs_icache.c so that we can hide xfs_inode_walk as the starting step
in more cleanups of inode walks.
