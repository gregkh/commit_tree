netdevsim: Add max_vfs to bus_dev

Currently there is no limit to the number of VFs netdevsim can enable.
In a real systems this value exist and used by the driver.
Fore example, some features might need to consider this value when
allocating memory.

Expose max_vfs variable to debugfs as configurable resource. If are VFs
configured (num_vfs != 0) then changing of max_vfs not allowed.
