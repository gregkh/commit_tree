vdpa: support packed virtqueue for set/get_vq_state()

This patch extends the vdpa_vq_state to support packed virtqueue
state which is basically the device/driver ring wrap counters and the
avail and used index. This will be used for the virito-vdpa support
for the packed virtqueue and the future vhost/vhost-vdpa support for
the packed virtqueue.
