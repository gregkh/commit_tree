net: phy: realtek: add delay to fix RXC generation issue

PHY will delay about 11.5ms to generate RXC clock when switching from
power down to normal operation. Read/write registers would also cause RXC
become unstable and stop for a while during this process. Realtek engineer
suggests 15ms or more delay can workaround this issue.
