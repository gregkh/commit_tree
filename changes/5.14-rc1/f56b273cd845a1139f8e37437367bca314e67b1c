pinctrl: at91: Constify struct at91_pinctrl_mux_ops

The at91_pinctrl_mux_ops struct is never modified by the driver. Make it
const wherever it is possible to allow the compiler to put the static
variables in read-only memory. Note that sam9x60_ops was already const,
but the const was cast away when the return value of of_match_device() was
cast to a pointer to a non-const struct at91_pinctrl_mux_ops.
