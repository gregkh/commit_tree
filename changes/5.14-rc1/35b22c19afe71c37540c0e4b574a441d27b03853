btrfs: send: fix crash when memory allocations trigger reclaim

When doing a send we don't expect the task to ever start a transaction
after the initial check that verifies if commit roots match the regular
roots. This is because after that we set current->journal_info with a
stub (special value) that signals we are in send context, so that we take
a read lock on an extent buffer when reading it from disk and verifying
it is valid (its generation matches the generation stored in the parent).
This stub was introduced in 2014 by commit a26e8c9f75b0bf ("Btrfs: don't
clear uptodate if the eb is under IO") in order to fix a concurrency issue
between send and balance.

However there is one particular exception where we end up needing to start
a transaction and when this happens it results in a crash with a stack
trace like the following:

This happens because when writing to the pipe, by calling kernel_write(),
we end up doing page allocations using GFP_HIGHUSER | __GFP_ACCOUNT as the
gfp flags, which allow reclaim to happen if there is memory pressure. This
allocation happens at fs/pipe.c:pipe_write().

If the reclaim is triggered, inode eviction can be triggered and that in
turn can result in starting a transaction if the inode has a link count
of 0. The transaction start happens early on during eviction, when we call
btrfs_commit_inode_delayed_inode() at btrfs_evict_inode(). This happens if
there is currently an open file descriptor for an inode with a link count
of 0 and the reclaim task gets a reference on the inode before that
descriptor is closed, in which case the reclaim task ends up doing the
final iput that triggers the inode eviction.

When we have assertions enabled (CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT=y), this triggers
the following assertion at transaction.c:start_transaction():

    /* Send isn't supposed to start transactions. */
    ASSERT(current->journal_info != BTRFS_SEND_TRANS_STUB);

And when assertions are not enabled, it triggers a crash since after that
assertion we cast current->journal_info into a transaction handle pointer
and then dereference it:

   if (current->journal_info) {
       WARN_ON(type & TRANS_EXTWRITERS);
       h = current->journal_info;
       refcount_inc(&h->use_count);
       (...)

Which obviously results in a crash due to an invalid memory access.

The same type of issue can happen during other memory allocations we
do directly in the send code with kmalloc (and friends) as they use
GFP_KERNEL and therefore may trigger reclaim too, which started to
happen since 2016 after commit e780b0d1c1523e ("btrfs: send: use
GFP_KERNEL everywhere").

The issue could be solved by setting up a NOFS context for the entire
send operation so that reclaim could not be triggered when allocating
memory or pages through kernel_write(). However that is not very friendly
and we can in fact get rid of the send stub because:

1) The stub was introduced way back in 2014 by commit a26e8c9f75b0bf
   ("Btrfs: don't clear uptodate if the eb is under IO") to solve an
   issue exclusive to when send and balance are running in parallel,
   however there were other problems between balance and send and we do
   not allow anymore to have balance and send run concurrently since
   commit 9e967495e0e0ae ("Btrfs: prevent send failures and crashes due
   to concurrent relocation"). More generically the issues are between
   send and relocation, and that last commit eliminated only the
   possibility of having send and balance run concurrently, but shrinking
   a device also can trigger relocation, and on zoned filesystems we have
   relocation of partially used block groups triggered automatically as
   well. The previous patch that has a subject of:

   "btrfs: ensure relocation never runs while we have send operations running"

   Addresses all the remaining cases that can trigger relocation.

2) We can actually allow starting and even committing transactions while
   in a send context if needed because send is not holding any locks that
   would block the start or the commit of a transaction.

So get rid of all the logic added by commit a26e8c9f75b0bf ("Btrfs: don't
clear uptodate if the eb is under IO"). We can now always call
clear_extent_buffer_uptodate() at verify_parent_transid() since send is
the only case that uses commit roots without having a transaction open or
without holding the commit_root_sem.
