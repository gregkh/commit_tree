drm/dp_dual_mode: Pass drm_device to drm_dp_dual_mode_detect()

Since we're about to be using drm_dbg_*() throughout the DP helpers, we'll
need to be able to access the DRM device in the dual mode DP helpers as
well. Note however that since drm_dp_dual_mode_detect() can be called with
DDC adapters that aren't part of a drm_dp_aux struct, we need to pass down
the drm_device to these functions instead of using drm_dp_aux.
