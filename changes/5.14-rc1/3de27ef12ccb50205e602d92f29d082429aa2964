arm64: dts: ti: k3-am64-main: Update TF-A load address to workaround USB DFU limitation

Due to a limitation for USB DFU boot mode, SPL load address has to be less
than  or equal to 0x70001000. So, load address of SPL and TF-A have been
moved to 0x70000000 and 0x701c0000 respectively, in U-Boot version 2021.10.

Therefore, update TF-A's location in the device tree node.
