sparc/vio: make remove callback return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct bus_type::remove()
because there is only little that can be done. To simplify the quest to
make this function return void, let struct vio_driver::remove() return
void, too. All users already unconditionally return 0, this commit makes
it obvious that returning an error code is a bad idea and should prevent
that future driver authors consider returning an error code.

Note there are two nominally different implementations for a vio bus:
one in arch/sparc/kernel/vio.c and the other in
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/vio.c. This patch only addresses the
former.
