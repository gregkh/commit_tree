can: gw: synchronize rcu operations before removing gw job entry

can_can_gw_rcv() is called under RCU protection, so after calling
can_rx_unregister(), we have to call synchronize_rcu in order to wait
for any RCU read-side critical sections to finish before removing the
kmem_cache entry with the referenced gw job entry.
