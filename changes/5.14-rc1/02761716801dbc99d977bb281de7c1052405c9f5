KVM: nVMX: Release eVMCS when enlightened VMENTRY was disabled

In theory, L1 can try to disable enlightened VMENTRY in VP assist page and
try to issue VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME. While nested_vmx_handle_enlightened_vmptrld()
properly handles this as 'EVMPTRLD_DISABLED', previously mapped eVMCS
remains mapped and thus all evmptr_is_valid() checks will still pass and
nested_vmx_run() will proceed when it shouldn't.

Release eVMCS immediately when we detect that enlightened vmentry was
disabled by L1.
