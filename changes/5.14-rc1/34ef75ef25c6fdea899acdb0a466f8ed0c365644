docs: path-lookup: remove filename_mountpoint

No filename_mountpoint any more
see commit: commit 161aff1d93ab ("LOOKUP_MOUNTPOINT:
fold path_mountpointat() into path_lookupat()")

Without filename_mountpoint and path_mountpoint(), the
numbers should be four & three:

"These four correspond roughly to the three path_*() functions"
