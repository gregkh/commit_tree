samples/bpf: Fix Segmentation fault for xdp_redirect command

A Segmentation fault error is caused when the following command
is executed.

$ sudo ./samples/bpf/xdp_redirect lo
Segmentation fault

This command is missing a device <IFNAME|IFINDEX> as an argument, resulting
in out-of-bounds access from argv.

If the number of devices for the xdp_redirect parameter is not 2,
we should report an error and exit.
