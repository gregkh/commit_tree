ubifs: fix snprintf() checking

The snprintf() function returns the number of characters (not
counting the NUL terminator) that it would have printed if we
had space.

This buffer has UBIFS_DFS_DIR_LEN characters plus one extra for
the terminator.  Printing UBIFS_DFS_DIR_LEN is okay but anything
higher will result in truncation.  Thus the comparison needs to be
change from == to >.

These strings are compile time constants so this patch doesn't
affect runtime.
