mtd: spi-nor: otp: return -EROFS if region is read-only

SPI NOR flashes will just ignore program commands if the OTP region is
locked. Thus, a user might not notice that the intended write didn't end
up in the flash. Return -EROFS to the user in this case. From what I can
tell, chips/cfi_cmdset_0001.c also return this error code.

One could optimize spi_nor_mtd_otp_range_is_locked() to read the status
register only once and not for every OTP region, but for that we would
need some more invasive changes. Given that this is
one-time-programmable memory and the normal access mode is reading, we
just live with the small overhead.

By moving the code around a bit, we can just check the length before
calling spi_nor_mtd_otp_range_is_locked() and avoid an underflow there
if a len is 0. This way we don't need to take the lock either. We also
skip the "*retlen = 0" assignment, mtdcore already takes care of that
for us.
