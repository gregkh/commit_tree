KVM: x86: hyper-v: Check access to HVCALL_NOTIFY_LONG_SPIN_WAIT hypercall

TLFS6.0b states that partition issuing HVCALL_NOTIFY_LONG_SPIN_WAIT must
posess 'UseHypercallForLongSpinWait' privilege but there's no
corresponding feature bit. Instead, we have "Recommended number of attempts
to retry a spinlock failure before notifying the hypervisor about the
failures. 0xFFFFFFFF indicates never notify." Use this to check access to
the hypercall. Also, check against zero as the corresponding CPUID must
be set (and '0' attempts before re-try is weird anyway).
