ice: register 1588 PTP clock device object for E810 devices

Add a new ice_ptp.c file for holding the basic PTP clock interface
functions. If the device supports PTP, call the new ice_ptp_init and
ice_ptp_release functions where appropriate.

If the function owns the hardware resource associated with the PTP
hardware clock, register with the PTP_1588_CLOCK infrastructure to
allocate a new clock object that represents the device hardware clock.

Implement basic functionality for reading and setting the clock time,
performing clock adjustments, and adjusting the clock frequency.

Future changes will introduce functionality for handling related
features including Tx and Rx timestamps.
