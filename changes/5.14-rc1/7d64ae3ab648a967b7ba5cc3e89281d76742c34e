userfaultfd/shmem: modify shmem_mfill_atomic_pte to use install_pte()

In a previous commit, we added the mfill_atomic_install_pte() helper.
This helper does the job of setting up PTEs for an existing page, to map
it into a given VMA.  It deals with both the anon and shmem cases, as well
as the shared and private cases.

In other words, shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() duplicates a case it already
handles.  So, expose it, and let shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() use it directly,
to reduce code duplication.

This requires that we refactor shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() a bit:

Instead of doing accounting (shmem_recalc_inode() et al) part-way through
the PTE setup, do it afterward.  This frees up mfill_atomic_install_pte()
from having to care about this accounting, and means we don't need to e.g.
shmem_uncharge() in the error path.

A side effect is this switches shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() to use
lru_cache_add_inactive_or_unevictable() instead of just lru_cache_add().
This wrapper does some extra accounting in an exceptional case, if
appropriate, so it's actually the more correct thing to use.
