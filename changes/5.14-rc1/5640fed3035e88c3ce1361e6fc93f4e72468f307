dt-bindings: iio: accel: bma180/bma255: Move bma254 to bma255 schema

BMA254 is very similar to BMA253/BMA255 which are both supported by
the bmc150-accel driver. In general, there is quite some overlap between
the bma180 and bmc150-accel driver, but the bmc150-accel driver has a few
more features (e.g. motion trigger/interrupt).

Let's move bma254 over to the bma255 schema (bmc150-accel driver).
