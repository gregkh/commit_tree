powerpc/bpf: Reject atomic ops in ppc32 JIT

Commit 91c960b0056672 ("bpf: Rename BPF_XADD and prepare to encode other
atomics in .imm") converted BPF_XADD to BPF_ATOMIC and updated all JIT
implementations to reject JIT'ing instructions with an immediate value
different from BPF_ADD. However, ppc32 BPF JIT was implemented around
the same time and didn't include the same change. Update the ppc32 JIT
accordingly.
