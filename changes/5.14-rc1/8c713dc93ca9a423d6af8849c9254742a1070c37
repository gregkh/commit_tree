rtnetlink: add alloc() method to rtnl_link_ops

In order to make rtnetlink ops that can create different
kinds of devices, like what we want to add to the WWAN
framework, the priv_size and setup parameters aren't quite
sufficient. Make this easier to manage by allowing ops to
allocate their own netdev via an @alloc method that gets
the tb netlink data.
