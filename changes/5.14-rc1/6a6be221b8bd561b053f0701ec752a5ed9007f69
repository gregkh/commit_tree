iio: adc: mxs-lradc: Fix buffer alignment in iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp()

To make code more readable, use a structure to express the channel
layout and ensure the timestamp is 8 byte aligned.
Add a comment on why the buffer is the size it is as not immediately
obvious.

Found during an audit of all calls of this function.
