io_uring: kill cached_cq_overflow

There are two copies of cq_overflow, shared with userspace and internal
cached one. It was needed for DRAIN accounting, but now we have yet
another knob to tune the accounting, i.e. cq_extra, and we can throw
away the internal counter and just increment the one in the shared ring.

If user modifies it as so never gets the right overflow value ever
again, it's its problem, even though before we would have restored it
back by next overflow.
