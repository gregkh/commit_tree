octeontx2-af: adding new lt def registers support

CN10k introduces following new LT DEF registers:
1. APAD (alignment padding) LT DEF registers are
enhancement to existing apad calculation algorithm
where not just ipv4 and ipv6 but also other protocols
can be matched and required alignment can be added by NIX.

2. ET LT DEF register defines layer information in NPC_RESULT_S
to identify the Ethertype location in L2 header. Used for
Ethertype overwriting in inline IPsec flow.

This patch adds required structures and some header changes. Also
strict version check (based on minor field) is imposed to highlight
version mismatch between the kernel headers and KPU profile.
