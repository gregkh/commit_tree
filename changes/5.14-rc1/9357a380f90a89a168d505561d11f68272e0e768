cpufreq: CPPC: Migrate to ->exit() callback instead of ->stop_cpu()

Commit 367dc4aa932b ("cpufreq: Add stop CPU callback to cpufreq_driver
interface") added the ->stop_cpu() callback to allow the drivers to do
clean up before the CPU is completely down and its state can't be
modified.

At that time the CPU hotplug framework used to call the cpufreq core's
registered notifier for different events like CPU_DOWN_PREPARE and
CPU_POST_DEAD. The ->stop_cpu() callback was called during the
CPU_DOWN_PREPARE event.

This is no longer the case, cpuhp_cpufreq_offline() is called only
once by the CPU hotplug core now and we don't really need two
separate callbacks for cpufreq drivers, i.e. ->stop_cpu() and
-<exit(), as everything can be done from the ->exit() callback
itself.

Migrate to using the ->exit() callback instead of ->stop_cpu().
