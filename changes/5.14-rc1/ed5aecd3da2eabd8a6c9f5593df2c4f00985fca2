tty: remove broken r3964 line discipline

Noone stepped up in the past two years since it was marked as BROKEN by
commit c7084edc3f6d (tty: mark Siemens R3964 line discipline as BROKEN).
Remove the line discipline for good.

Three remarks:
* we remove also the uapi header (as noone is able to use that interface
  anyway)
* we do *not* remove the N_R3964 constant definition from tty.h, so it
  remains reserved.
* in_interrupt() check is now removed from vt's con_put_char. Noone else
  calls tty_operations::put_char from interrupt context.
