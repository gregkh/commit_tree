virtio/vsock: set packet's type in virtio_transport_send_pkt_info()

There is no need to set type of packet which differs from type
of socket, so move passing type of packet from 'info' structure
to  'virtio_transport_send_pkt_info()' function. Since at current
time only stream type is supported, set it directly in 'virtio_
transport_send_pkt_info()', so callers don't need to set it.
