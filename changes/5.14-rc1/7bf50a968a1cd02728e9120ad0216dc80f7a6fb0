iio:adc:ad7476: Handle the different regulators used by various parts.

Not all of the parts supported by this driver use single supply.
Hence we add chip_info fields to say what additional supplies exist
and in the case of vref, ensure that is used for the reference voltage
rather than vcc.

One corner case is the ad7091r which has an internal reference that
can be over-driven by an external reference connected on the vref pin.
To handle that force_ext_vref is introduced and set if an optional
vref regulator is present.

Tested using really simple QEMU model and some fixed regulators.

The devm_add_action_or_reset() callback is changed to take the
regulator as it's parameter so we can use one callback for all the
different regulators without having to store pointers to them in
the iio_priv() structure.
