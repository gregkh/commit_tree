fs: dlm: add functionality to re-transmit a message

This patch introduces a retransmit functionality for a lowcomms message
handle. It's just allocates a new buffer and transmit it again, no
special handling about prioritize it because keeping bytestream in order.

To avoid another connection look some refactor was done to make a new
buffer allocation with a preexisting connection pointer.
