sched/fair: Ensure _sum and _avg values stay consistent

The _sum and _avg values are in general sync together with the PELT
divider. They are however not always completely in perfect sync,
resulting in situations where _sum gets to zero while _avg stays
positive. Such situations are undesirable.

This comes from the fact that PELT will increase period_contrib, also
increasing the PELT divider, without updating _sum and _avg values to
stay in perfect sync where (_sum == _avg * divider). However, such PELT
change will never lower _sum, making it impossible to end up in a
situation where _sum is zero and _avg is not.

Therefore, we need to ensure that when subtracting load outside PELT,
that when _sum is zero, _avg is also set to zero. This occurs when
(_sum < _avg * divider), and the subtracted (_avg * divider) is bigger
or equal to the current _sum, while the subtracted _avg is smaller than
the current _avg.
