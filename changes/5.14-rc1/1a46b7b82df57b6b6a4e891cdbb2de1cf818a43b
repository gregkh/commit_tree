ASoC: cs35l35: Correct errata handling

Currently the check of errata_chk will always evaluate to false since
the values tested don't come under the mask used. A shift of the field
is missing, add this. Also there is an error in the values tested, they
don't match the comment and the value 0x3 is not a valid value for the
field in question. Update the value to match the comment.
