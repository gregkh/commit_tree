irqdomain: Protect the linear revmap with RCU

It is pretty odd that the radix tree uses RCU while the linear
portion doesn't, leading to potential surprises for the users,
depending on how the irqdomain has been created.

Fix this by moving the update of the linear revmap under
the mutex, and the lookup under the RCU read-side lock.

The mutex name is updated to reflect that it doesn't only
cover the radix-tree anymore.
