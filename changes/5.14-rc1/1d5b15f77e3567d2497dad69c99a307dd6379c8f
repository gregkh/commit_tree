drm/amd/display: 7 retries + 50 ms timeout on AUX DEFER

[WHY]
DP 2.0 SCR specifies that TX devices must retry at least 7 times when
receiving an AUX DEFER reply from RX. In addition, the specification
states that the TX shall not retry indefinitely, and gives a suggestive
timeout interval of 50ms.

[HOW]
Keep retrying until both 7 or more retries have been made, and the 50ms
interval has passed.
