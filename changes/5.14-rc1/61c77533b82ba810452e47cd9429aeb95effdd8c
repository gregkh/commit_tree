net: dsa: sja1105: completely error out in sja1105_static_config_reload if something fails

If reloading the static config fails for whatever reason, for example if
sja1105_static_config_check_valid() fails, then we "goto out_unlock_ptp"
but we print anyway that "Reset switch and programmed static config.",
which is confusing because we didn't. We also do a bunch of other stuff
like reprogram the XPCS and reload the credit-based shapers, as if a
switch reset took place, which didn't.

So just unlock the PTP lock and goto out, skipping all of that.
