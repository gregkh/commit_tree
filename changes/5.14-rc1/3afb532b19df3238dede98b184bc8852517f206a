coccinelle: misc: restrict patch mode in flexible_array.cocci

Skip patches generation for structs with a single field.
Changing a zero-length array to a flexible array member in a struct
with no named members breaks the compilation. However, reporting
such cases is still valuable, e.g. commit 637464c59e0b
("ACPI: NFIT: Fix flexible_array.cocci warnings").
