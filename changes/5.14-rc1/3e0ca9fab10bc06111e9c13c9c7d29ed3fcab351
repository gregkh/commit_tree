habanalabs/gaudi: send hard reset cause to preboot

LKD should provide hard reset cause to preboot prior to
loading any FW components (in case needed).
Current implementation is based on the new FW 'COMMS' protocol
In cased 'COMMS' is disabled - reset cause won't be sent.
Currently, only 2 reset causes are shared: HEARTBEAT & TDR.

Sending the reset cause will provide the missing watchdog
info that the firmware needs to provide to the BMC.
