RDMA/core: Allow port_groups to be used with namespaces

Now that the port_groups data is being destroyed and managed by the core
code this restriction is no longer needed. All the ib_port_attrs are
compatible with the core's sysfs lifecycle.

When the main device is destroyed and moved to another namespace the
driver's port sysfs can be created/destroyed as well due to it now being a
simple attribute list.
