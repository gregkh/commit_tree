media: exynos4-is: fix pm_runtime_get_sync() usage count

The pm_runtime_get_sync() internally increments the
dev->power.usage_count without decrementing it, even on errors.

On some places, this is ok, but on others the usage count
ended being unbalanced on failures.

Replace it by the new pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), introduced by:
commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
in order to properly decrement the usage counter, avoiding
a potential PM usage counter leak.

As a bonus, such function always return zero on success. So,
some code can be simplified.
