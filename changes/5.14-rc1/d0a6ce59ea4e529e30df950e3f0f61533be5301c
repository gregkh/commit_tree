arm64: dts: qcom: sm8150: Add support for SONY Xperia 1 / 5 (Kumano platform)

Add support for SONY Xperia 1 and 5 smartphones, both based on the
Qualcomm SM8150 chipset. There also exist 5G-capable versions of these
devices, but they weren't sold much (if at all) outside Japan.

The devices are affected by a scary UFS behaviour where sending a certain UFS
command (which is worked around on downstream) renders the device unbootable,
by effectively erasing the bootloader. Therefore UFS AND UFSPHY are strictly
disabled for now.

Downstream workaround:
