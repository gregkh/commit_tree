powerpc/optprobes: Minimise casts

nip is already an unsigned long, no cast needed.

op_callback_addr and emulate_step_addr are kprobe_opcode_t *.
There value is obtained with ppc_kallsyms_lookup_name() which
returns 'unsigned long', and there values are used create_branch()
which expects 'unsigned long'. So change them to 'unsigned long'
to avoid casting them back and forth.

can_optimize() used p->addr several times as 'unsigned long'.
Use a local 'unsigned long' variable and avoid casting multiple times.
