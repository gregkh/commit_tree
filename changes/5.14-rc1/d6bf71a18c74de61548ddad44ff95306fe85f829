KVM: nVMX: Ignore 'hv_clean_fields' data when eVMCS data is copied in vmx_get_nested_state()

'Clean fields' data from enlightened VMCS is only valid upon vmentry: L1
hypervisor is not obliged to keep it up-to-date while it is mangling L2's
state, KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE request may come at a wrong moment when actual
eVMCS changes are unsynchronized with 'hv_clean_fields'. As upon migration
VMCS12 is used as a source of ultimate truth, we must make sure we pick all
the changes to eVMCS and thus 'clean fields' data must be ignored.
