Revert "KVM: MMU: record maximum physical address width in kvm_mmu_extended_role"

Drop MAXPHYADDR from mmu_role now that all MMUs have their role
invalidated after a CPUID update.  Invalidating the role forces all MMUs
to re-evaluate the guest's MAXPHYADDR, and the guest's MAXPHYADDR can
only be changed only through a CPUID update.

This reverts commit de3ccd26fafc707b09792d9b633c8b5b48865315.
