staging: unisys: visorhba: Convert module from IDR to XArray

Converted visorhba from IDR to XArray. The abstract data type XArray is
more memory-efficient, parallelizable, and cache friendly. It takes
advantage of RCU to perform lookups without locking. Furthermore, IDR is
deprecated because XArray has a better (cleaner and more consistent)
API.
