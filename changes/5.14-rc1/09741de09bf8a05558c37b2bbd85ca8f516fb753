media: i2c: rdacm20: Enable noise immunity

Enable the noise immunity threshold at the end of the rdacm20
initialization routine.

The rdacm20 camera module has been so far tested with a startup
delay that allowed the embedded MCU to program the serializer. If
the initialization routine is run before the MCU programs the
serializer and the image sensor and their addresses gets changed
by the rdacm20 driver it is required to manually enable the noise
immunity threshold to make the communication on the control channel
more reliable.
