docs: ABI: sysfs-class-backlight: unify ambient light zone nodes

./scripts/get_abi.pl is warning about duplicated symbol
definition:

	Warning: /sys/class/backlight/<backlight>/l1_daylight_max is defined 2 times:  ./Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-backlight-driver-adp8870:4  ./Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-backlight-adp8860:12

What happens is that 3 drivers use the same pattern to report
max and dim setting for different ambient light zones.

It should be noticed that the adp8870 doc was missing an
entry for l1_daylight_dim, which was fixed on this patch.

While the ambient light zone is device-specific, the sysfs
definition is actually common. So, unify them at:

	Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-backlight

and use as the contact point, the e-mail reported by
get_maintainers.pl for the subsystem.
