atl1c: add 4 RX/TX queue support for Mikrotik 10/25G NIC

More RX/TX queues on a network card help spread the CPU load among
cores and achieve higher overall networking performance. The new
Mikrotik 10/25G NIC supports 4 RX and 4 TX queues. TX queues are
treated with equal priority. RX queue balancing is fixed based on
L2/L3/L4 hash.

This adds support for 4 RX/TX queues while maintaining backwards
compatibility with older hardware.

Simultaneous TX + RX performance on AMD Threadripper 3960X
with Mikrotik 10/25G NIC improved from 1.6Mpps to 3.2Mpps per port.

Backwards compatiblitiy was verified with AR8151 and AR8131 based
NICs.
