igc: Refactor __igc_xdp_run_prog()

Refactor __igc_xdp_run_prog() helper from igc_xdp_run_prog(),
preparing the code for AF_XDP zero-copy support which is added
by upcoming patches.

The existing igc_xdp_run_prog() caters to regular XDP rx path
which has to verify if bpf_prog is not NULL. Zero-copy
path assumes that bpf_prog is not NULL and hence this check is
not required. Therefore it makes sense to refactor the common
code into a helper function, to avoid code duplication.
