mm/debug_vm_pgtable: remove redundant pfn_{pmd/pte}() and fix one comment mistake

Remove redundant pfn_{pmd/pte}() in {pmd/pte}_advanced_tests() and adjust
pfn_pud() in pud_advanced_tests() to make it similar with other two
functions.

In addition, the branch condition should be CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE
instead of CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PTE_DEVMAP.
