CFI: Move function_nocfi() into compiler.h

Currently the common definition of function_nocfi() is provided by
<linux/mm.h>, and architectures are expected to provide a definition in
<asm/memory.h>. Due to header dependencies, this can make it hard to use
function_nocfi() in low-level headers.

As function_nocfi() has no dependency on any mm code, nor on any memory
definitions, it doesn't need to live in <linux/mm.h> or <asm/memory.h>.
Generally, it would make more sense for it to live in
<linux/compiler.h>, where an architecture can override it in
<asm/compiler.h>.

Move the definitions accordingly.
