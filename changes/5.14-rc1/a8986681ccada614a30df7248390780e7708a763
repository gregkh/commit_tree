net: dsa: export the dsa_port_is_{user,cpu,dsa} helpers

The difference between dsa_is_user_port and dsa_port_is_user is that the
former needs to look up the list of ports of the DSA switch tree in
order to find the struct dsa_port, while the latter directly receives it
as an argument.

dsa_is_user_port is already in widespread use and has its place, so
there isn't any chance of converting all callers to a single form.
But being able to do:
	dsa_port_is_user(dp)
instead of
	dsa_is_user_port(dp->ds, dp->index)

is much more efficient too, especially when the "dp" comes from an
iterator over the DSA switch tree - this reduces the complexity from
quadratic to linear.

Move these helpers from dsa2.c to include/net/dsa.h so that others can
use them too.
