arm64: dts: meson: vim3: enable hdmi audio loopback

Enable audio capture frontends and a tdm decoder.
This makes it possible to loopback the audio played on the hdmi codec,
which is the only output interface at the moment.

Of course, one TODDR device would be enough to do that but since
the 3 FRDDRs are enabled on the playback side, let's do the same on the
capture side.
