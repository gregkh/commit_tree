net: flow_dissector: fix RPS on DSA masters

After the blamed patch, __skb_flow_dissect() on the DSA master stopped
adjusting for the length of the DSA headers. This is because it was told
to adjust only if the needed_headroom is zero, aka if there is no DSA
header. Of course, the adjustment should be done only if there _is_ a
DSA header.

Modify the comment too so it is clearer.
