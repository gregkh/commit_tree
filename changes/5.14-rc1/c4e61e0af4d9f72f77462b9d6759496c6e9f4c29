arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916-huawei-g7: Add NFC

The Huawei Ascend G7 supports NFC using the NXP PN547, which is
supported by the nxp-nci-i2c driver in mainline. It seems to detect
NFC tags using "nfctool" just fine, although it seems like there
are not really any useful applications making use of the Linux NFC
subsystem. :(
