virtio-blk: limit seg_max to a safe value

The struct virtio_blk_config seg_max value is read from the device and
incremented by 2 to account for the request header and status byte
descriptors added by the driver.

In preparation for supporting untrusted virtio-blk devices, protect
against integer overflow and limit the value to a safe maximum.
