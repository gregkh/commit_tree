power: supply: ab8500: Fix an old bug

Trying to get the AB8500 charging driver working I ran into a bit
of bitrot: we haven't used the driver for a while so errors in
refactorings won't be noticed.

This one is pretty self evident: use argument to the macro or we
end up with a random pointer to something else.
