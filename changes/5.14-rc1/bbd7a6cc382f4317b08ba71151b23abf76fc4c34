clk: divider: Add re-usable determine_rate implementations

These are useful when running on 32-bit systems to increase the upper
supported frequency limit. clk_ops.round_rate returns a signed long
which limits the maximum rate on 32-bit systems to 2^31 (or approx.
2.14GHz). clk_ops.determine_rate internally uses an unsigned long so
the maximum rate on 32-bit systems is 2^32 or approx. 4.29GHz.

To avoid code-duplication switch over divider_{ro_,}round_rate_parent
to use the new divider_{ro_,}determine_rate functions.
