usb: phy: tegra: Wait for VBUS wakeup status deassertion on suspend

Some devices need an extra delay after losing VBUS, otherwise VBUS may
be detected as active at suspend time, preventing the PHY's suspension
by the VBUS detection sensor. This problem was found on Asus Transformer
TF700T (Tegra30) tablet device, where the USB PHY wakes up immediately
from suspend because VBUS sensor continues to detect VBUS as active after
disconnection. We need to poll the PHY's VBUS wakeup status until it's
deasserted before suspending PHY in order to fix this minor trouble.
