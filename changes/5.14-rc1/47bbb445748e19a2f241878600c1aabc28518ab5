staging: rtl8188eu: remove HW_DEF_ODM_DBG_FLAG enum value

Remove HW_DEF_ODM_DBG_FLAG definition from the hal_def_variable enum
in include/hal_intf.h, and remove its usage from the switch statement
in rtw_hal_get_def_var inside hal/usb_halinit.c - this is dead code
and no longer used, now that ODM_RT_TRACE and include/odm_debug.h
have been removed.
