rtw88: add quirks to disable pci capabilities

8821CE with ASPM cannot work properly on Protempo Ltd L116HTN6SPW. Add a
quirk to disable the cap.

The reporter describes the symptom is that this module (driver) causes
frequent freezes, randomly but usually within a few minutes of running
(thus very soon after boot): screen display remains frozen, no response
to either keyboard or mouse input. All I can do is to hold the power
button to power off, then reboot.
