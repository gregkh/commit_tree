ALSA: sb: Fix potential double-free of CSP mixer elements

snd_sb_qsound_destroy() contains the calls of removing the previously
created mixer controls, but it doesn't clear the pointers.  As
snd_sb_qsound_destroy() itself may be repeatedly called via ioctl,
this could lead to double-free potentially.

Fix it by clearing the struct fields properly afterwards.
