Documentation: kunit: add tips for running KUnit

This is long overdue.

There are several things that aren't nailed down (in-tree
.kunitconfig's), or partially broken (GCOV on UML), but having them
documented, warts and all, is better than having nothing.

This covers a bunch of the more recent features
* kunit_filter_glob
* kunit.py run --kunitconfig
* slightly more detail on building tests as modules
* CONFIG_KUNIT_DEBUGFS

By my count, the only headline features now not mentioned are the KASAN
integration and KernelCI json output support (kunit.py run --json).

And then it also discusses how to get code coverage reports under UML
and non-UML since this is a question people have repeatedly asked.

Non-UML coverage collection is no different from normal, but we should
probably explicitly call this out.

As for UML, I was able to get it working again with two small hacks.*
E.g. with CONFIG_KUNIT=y && CONFIG_KUNIT_ALL_TESTS=y
  Overall coverage rate:
    lines......: 15.1% (18294 of 120776 lines)
    functions..: 16.8% (1860 of 11050 functions)

Note: this doesn't document --alltests since this is not stable yet.
Hopefully being run more frequently as part of KernelCI will help...

*Using gcc/gcov-6 and not using uml_abort() in os_dump_core().
I've documented these hacks in "Notes" but left TODOs for
brendanhiggins@google.com who tracked down the runtime issue in GCC.
To be clear: these are not issues specific to KUnit, but rather to UML.
