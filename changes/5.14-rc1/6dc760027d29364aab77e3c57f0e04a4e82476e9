RDMA/bnxt_re: Drop unnecessary NULL checks after container_of

The result of container_of() operations is never NULL unless the first
element of the embedding structure is extracted. This is either not the
case here, or the pointer passed to container_of() is known to be not
NULL. The NULL checks are therefore unnecessary and misleading.
Remove them.

The channges in this patch were made automatically with the following
Coccinelle script.

@@
type t;
identifier v;
statement s;

<+...
(
  t v = container_of(...);
|
  v = container_of(...);
)
  ...
  when != v
- if (\( !v \| v == NULL \) ) s
