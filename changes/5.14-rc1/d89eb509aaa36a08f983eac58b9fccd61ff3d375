RDMA/core: Remove the kobject_uevent() NOP

This call does nothing because the ib_port kobj is nested under a struct
device kobject and the dev_uevent_filter() function of the struct device
blocks uevents for any children kobj's that are not also struct devices.

A uevent for the struct device will be triggered after
ib_setup_port_attrs() returns which causes udev to pick up all the deep
"attributes" which are implemented as kobjects nested under a struct
device and assign them to the udev object for the struct device:

 $ udevadm info -a /sys/class/infiniband/ibp0s9
     ATTR{ports/1/counters/excessive_buffer_overrun_errors}=="0"
