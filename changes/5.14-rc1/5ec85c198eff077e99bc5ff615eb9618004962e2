ALSA: bebob: distinguish M-Audio ProFire Lightbridge quirk

In former commit, ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 packet streaming engine drops
initial tx packets till the packet includes any event. This allows ALSA
bebob driver not to give option to skip initial packet since the engine
does drop the initial packet.

However, M-Audio ProFire Lightbridge has a quirk to stop packet
transmission after start multiplexing event to the packet. After several
thousands cycles, it restart packet transmission again.

This commit specializes the usage of initial skip option for the model.
Additionally, this commit expands timeout enough to wait processing
content of tx packet.
