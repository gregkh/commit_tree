iio: pressure: icp10100: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

The devm_ handled runtime pm disable calls pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend()
which isn't balancing a matching get call.  It isn't a bug as such,
because the runtime pm core doesn't decrement the reference count below
zero, but it is missleading so let's drop it.

Using pm_runtime_resume_and_get() new call makes it easy to handle
failures in resume as it doesn't hold a reference count if it exits
with an error.
