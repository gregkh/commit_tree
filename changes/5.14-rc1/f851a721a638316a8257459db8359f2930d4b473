net: bridge: allow br_fdb_replay to be called for the bridge device

When a port joins a bridge which already has local FDB entries pointing
to the bridge device itself, we would like to offload those, so allow
the "dev" argument to be equal to the bridge too. The code already does
what we need in that case.
