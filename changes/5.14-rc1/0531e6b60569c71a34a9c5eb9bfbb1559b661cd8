soundwire: bandwidth allocation: improve error messages

In rare corner cases, we see an error with the log:

[  838.297840] soundwire sdw-master-1: Compute bus params failed: -22

That's not very useful, there can be two different error conditions
with the same -EINVAL code provided to the caller.

Let's add better dev_err() messages to figure out what went wrong.
