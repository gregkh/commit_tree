firmware: arm_scmi: Add clock management to the SCMI power domain

Clocks requiring non-atomic contexts are supported by the generic clock
PM layer since commit 0bfa0820c274 ("PM: clk: make PM clock layer
compatible with clocks that must sleep"). That means we can have
SCMI-based clocks be managed by the SCMI power domain now.
