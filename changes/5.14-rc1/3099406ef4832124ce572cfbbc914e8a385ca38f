ALSA: hda: Release codec display power during shutdown/reboot

Similarly to the previous patch for the HDA controller make sure here
that codecs also drop the display power reference during shutdown and
reboot.

This fixes a power ref leaked WARN in i915 during shutdown if the HDA
driver is built with CONFIG_PM=n.
