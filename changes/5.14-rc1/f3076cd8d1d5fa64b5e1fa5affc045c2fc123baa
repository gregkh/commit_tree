power: supply: rt5033_battery: Fix device tree enumeration

The fuel gauge in the RT5033 PMIC has its own I2C bus and interrupt
line. Therefore, it is not actually part of the RT5033 MFD and needs
its own of_match_table to probe properly.

Also, given that it's independent of the MFD, there is actually
no need to make the Kconfig depend on MFD_RT5033. Although the driver
uses the shared <linux/mfd/rt5033.h> header, there is no compile
or runtime dependency on the RT5033 MFD driver.
