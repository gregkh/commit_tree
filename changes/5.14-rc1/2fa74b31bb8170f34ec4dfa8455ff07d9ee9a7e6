ASoC: amd: renoir: Remove redundant assignment to pdm_ctrl and pdm_enable and pdm_dma_enable

Variable pdm_ctrl and pdm_enable and pdm_dma_enable are set to '0x00',
but they are overwritten later on, so these are redundant assignments
that can be removed.

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

sound/soc/amd/renoir/acp3x-pdm-dma.c:148:2: warning: Value stored to
'pdm_dma_enable' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].

sound/soc/amd/renoir/acp3x-pdm-dma.c:147:2: warning: Value stored to
'pdm_enable' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].

sound/soc/amd/renoir/acp3x-pdm-dma.c:80:2: warning: Value stored to
'pdm_ctrl' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
