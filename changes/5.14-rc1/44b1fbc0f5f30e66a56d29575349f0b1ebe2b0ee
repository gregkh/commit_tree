m68k/q40: Replace q40ide driver with pata_falcon and falconide

This allows m68k q40 systems to switch from the deprecated IDE subsystem
to libata.

Enhance the byte-swapping falconide and pata_falcon platform drivers to
accept an irq resource, for use on q40. Atari ST-DMA IRQ arrangements seem
to co-exist with q40 IRQ arrangements without too much mess.

The new IO resources were added solely for the purpose of making
request_region() reservations identical to those made by q40ide: these
regions aren't used for actual IO.
