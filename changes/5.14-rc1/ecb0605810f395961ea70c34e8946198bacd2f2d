net: enetc: use get/put_unaligned helpers for MAC address handling

The supplied buffer for the MAC address might not be aligned. Thus
doing a 32bit (or 16bit) access could be on an unaligned address. For
now, enetc is only used on aarch64 which can do unaligned accesses, thus
there is no error. In any case, be correct and use the get/put_unaligned
helpers.
