drm/i915/gt: Do release kernel context if breadcrumb measure fails

Commit fb5970da1b42 ("drm/i915/gt: Use the kernel_context to measure the
breadcrumb size") reordered some operations inside engine_init_common()
and added an error unwind path to that function.  In that path, a
reference to a kernel context candidate supposed to be released on error
was put, but the context, pinned when created, was not unpinned first.
Fix it by replacing intel_context_put() with destroy_pinned_context()
introduced later by commit b436a5f8b6c8 ("drm/i915/gt: Track all timelines
created using the HWSP").
