kvfree_rcu: Fix comments according to current code

The kvfree_rcu() function now defers allocations in the common
case due to the fact that there is no lockless access to the
memory-allocator caches/pools.  In addition, in CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y
and in CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y kernels, there is no reliable way to
determine if spinlocks are held.  As a result, allocation is deferred in
the common case, and the two-argument form of kvfree_rcu() thus uses the
"channel 3" queue through all the rcu_head structures.  This channel
is called referred to as the emergency case in comments, and these
comments are now obsolete.

This commit therefore updates these comments to reflect the new
common-case nature of such emergencies.
