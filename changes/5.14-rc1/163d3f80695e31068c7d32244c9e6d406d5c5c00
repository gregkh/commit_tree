arm64: dcache_by_line_op to take end parameter instead of size

To be consistent with other functions with similar names and
functionality in cacheflush.h, cache.S, and cachetlb.rst, change
to specify the range in terms of start and end, as opposed to
start and size.

No functional change intended.
