net: qualcomm: rmnet: remove unneeded code

The previous patch makes rmnet_map_ipv4_dl_csum_trailer() return
early with an error if it is determined that the computed checksum
for the IP payload does not match what was expected.

If the computed checksum *does* match the expected value, the IP
payload (i.e., the transport message), can be considered good.
There is no need to do any further processing of the message.

This means a big block of code is unnecessary for validating the
transport checksum value, and can be removed.

Make comparable changes in rmnet_map_ipv6_dl_csum_trailer().
