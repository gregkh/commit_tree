bpf: Make some symbols static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

kernel/bpf/syscall.c:4567:29: warning:
 symbol 'bpf_sys_bpf_proto' was not declared. Should it be static?
kernel/bpf/syscall.c:4592:29: warning:
 symbol 'bpf_sys_close_proto' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of syscall.c, so marks it static.
