iommu/amd: Fix extended features logging

print_iommu_info prints the EFR register and then the decoded list of
features on a separate line:

pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: Extended features (0x206d73ef22254ade):
 PPR X2APIC NX GT IA GA PC GA_vAPIC

The second line is emitted via 'pr_cont', which causes it to have a
different ('warn') loglevel compared to the previous line ('info').

Commit 9a295ff0ffc9 attempted to rectify this by removing the newline
from the pci_info format string, but this doesn't work, as pci_info
calls implicitly append a newline anyway.

Printing the decoded features on the same line would make it quite long.
Instead, change pci_info() to pr_info() to omit PCI bus location info,
which is also shown in the preceding message. This results in:

pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: Found IOMMU cap 0x40
AMD-Vi: Extended features (0x206d73ef22254ade): PPR X2APIC NX GT IA GA PC GA_vAPIC
AMD-Vi: Interrupt remapping enabled
