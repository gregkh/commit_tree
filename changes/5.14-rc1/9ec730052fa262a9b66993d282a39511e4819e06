ALSA: usb-audio: Refactoring UAC2/3 clock setup code

This patch just does refactoring of the UAC2/3 clock setup code.
There should be no functional changes.  The major changes are:

* Provide union objects for pointing both UAC2 and UAC3 objects
* Unify clock source, selector and multiplier helper functions
* Unify __uac_clock_find_source() to deal with both UAC2 and UAC3
  equally
