iio: light: isl29028: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

In remove this driver called pm_runtime_put_noidle() but there is
no matching get operation.  This does not cause any problems because
the reference counter will not change if already zero, but it
does make the code harder to reason about so should be dropped.

Whilst we are here, use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to replace open
coded version.
