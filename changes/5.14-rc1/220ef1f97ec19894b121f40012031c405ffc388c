igc: Update driver to use ethtool_sprintf

Complete to commit c8d4725e985d ("intel: Update drivers to use
ethtool_sprintf")
Update the igc driver to make use of ethtool_sprintf. The general idea
is to reduce code size and overhead by replacing the repeated pattern of
string printf statements and ETH_STRING_LEN counter increments.
