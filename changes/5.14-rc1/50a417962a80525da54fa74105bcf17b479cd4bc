KVM: nVMX: Consolidate VM-Enter/VM-Exit TLB flush and MMU sync logic

Drop the dedicated nested_vmx_transition_mmu_sync() now that the MMU sync
is handled via KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST, and fold that flush into the
all-encompassing nested_vmx_transition_tlb_flush().

Opportunistically add a comment explaning why nested EPT never needs to
sync the MMU on VM-Enter.
