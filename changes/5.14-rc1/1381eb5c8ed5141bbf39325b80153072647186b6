iwlwifi: correct HE capabilities

The (default) HE capabilities for our devices weren't handled
correctly, adjust them to match the correct capabilities of
the devices.

Since the device regulatory will not allow 160 MHz on 5 GHz,
don't advertise this capability by default; do it only if an
NVM file is being loaded that might change the regulatory
parameters.
