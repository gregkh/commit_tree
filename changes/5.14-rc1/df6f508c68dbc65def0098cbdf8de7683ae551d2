s390/ap/zcrypt: notify userspace with online, config and mode info

This patch brings 3 reworked/new uevent changes:
* All AP uevents caused by an ap card or queue device now carry an
  additional uevent env value MODE=<accel|cca|ep11>. Here is an
  example:
    KERNEL[1267.301292] add	 /devices/ap/card0a (ap)
    ACTION=add
    DEVPATH=/devices/ap/card0a
    SUBSYSTEM=ap
    DEVTYPE=ap_card
    DEV_TYPE=000D
    MODALIAS=ap:t0D
    MODE=ep11			 <- this is new
    SEQNUM=1095
  This is true for bind, unbind, add, remove, and change uevents
  related to ap card or ap queue devices.
* On a change of the soft online attribute on a zcrypt queue or card
  device a new CHANGE uevent is sent with an env value ONLINE=<0|1>.
  Example uevent:
    KERNEL[613.067531] change	/devices/ap/card09/09.0011 (ap)
    ACTION=change
    DEVPATH=/devices/ap/card09/09.0011
    SUBSYSTEM=ap
    ONLINE=0			<- this is new
    DEVTYPE=ap_queue
    DRIVER=cex4queue
    MODE=cca
    SEQNUM=1070
- On a change of the config state of an zcrypt card device a new
  CHANGE uevent is sent with an env value CONFIG=<0|1>.
  Example uevent:
    KERNEL[876.258680] change	/devices/ap/card09 (ap)
    ACTION=change
    DEVPATH=/devices/ap/card09
    SUBSYSTEM=ap
    CONFIG=0			<- this is new
    DEVTYPE=ap_card
    DRIVER=cex4card
    DEV_TYPE=000D
    MODALIAS=ap:t0D
    MODE=cca
    SEQNUM=1073
  Setting a card config on/off causes the dependent queue devices to
  follow the config state change and thus uevents informing about the
  config state change for the queue devices are also emitted.
