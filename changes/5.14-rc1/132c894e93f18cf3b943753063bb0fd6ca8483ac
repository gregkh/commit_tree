drm/amd/display: treat memory as a single-channel for asymmetric memory V3

Previous patch caused crash and had been reverted. This patch
addresses the issue without regression.

[Why]
1. Driver use umachannelnumber to calculate watermarks for stutter.
In asymmetric memory config, the actual bandwidth is less than
dual-channel. The bandwidth should be the same as single-channel.
2. We found single rank dimm need additional delay time for stutter.

[How]
Get information from each DIMM. Treat memory config as a single-channel
for asymmetric memory in bandwidth calculating.
Add additional delay time for single rank dimm.
