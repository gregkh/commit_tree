net/mlx5e: Disable TLS device offload in kdump mode

Under kdump environment we want to use the smallest possible amount
of resources, that includes setting SQ size to minimum.
However, when running on a device that supports TLS device offload,
then the SQ stop room becomes larger than with non-capable device and
requires increasing the SQ size.

Since TLS device offload is not necessary in kdump mode, disable it to
reduce the memory requirements for capable devices.

With this change, the needed SQ stop room size drops by 33.
