xfs: Add helper xfs_attr_node_addname_find_attr

This patch separates the first half of xfs_attr_node_addname into a
helper function xfs_attr_node_addname_find_attr.  It also replaces the
restart goto with an EAGAIN return code driven by a loop in the calling
function.  This looks odd now, but will clean up nicly once we introduce
the state machine.  It will also enable hoisting the last state out of
xfs_attr_node_addname with out having to plumb in a "done" parameter to
know if we need to move to the next state or not.
