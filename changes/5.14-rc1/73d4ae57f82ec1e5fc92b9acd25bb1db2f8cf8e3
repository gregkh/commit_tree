regulator: mt6359: Get rid of linear_range tables

The MT6359_BUCK and MT6359_LDO_LINEAR macros setup both
linear settings (min_uV, uV_step, linear_min_sel) and linar_range
(linear_ranges, n_linear_ranges) settings.
All the linear range tables actually only has one entry.
Let's simplify it by using linear instead of linear range.

The linear_min_sel setting is 0 for all cases, remove it
from the macros.
