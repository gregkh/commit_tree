ASoC: q6dsp: q6afe: remove unneeded dead-store initialization

Variables 'wait' and 'port_id' are being initialized, however the
values are never read and updated later on, hence the redundant
initializations can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/q6afe.c:933:21: warning: Value stored to 'wait'
during its initialization is never read
sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/q6afe.c:1186:6: warning: Value stored to 'port_id'
during its initialization is never read
