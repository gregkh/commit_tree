iio: accel: bma180: Fix BMA25x bandwidth register values

According to the BMA253 datasheet [1] and BMA250 datasheet [2] the
bandwidth value for BMA25x should be set as 01xxx:

  "Settings 00xxx result in a bandwidth of 7.81 Hz; [...]
   It is recommended [...] to use the range from ´01000b´ to ´01111b´
   only in order to be compatible with future products."

However, at the moment the drivers sets bandwidth values from 0 to 6,
which is not recommended and always results into 7.81 Hz bandwidth
according to the datasheet.

Fix this by introducing a bw_offset = 8 = 01000b for BMA25x,
so the additional bit is always set for BMA25x.
