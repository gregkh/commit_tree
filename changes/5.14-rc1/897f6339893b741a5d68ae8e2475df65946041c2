hwmon: (max31790) Report correct current pwm duty cycles

The MAX31790 has two sets of registers for pwm duty cycles, one to request
a duty cycle and one to read the actual current duty cycle. Both do not
have to be the same.

When reporting the pwm duty cycle to the user, the actual pwm duty cycle
from pwm duty cycle registers needs to be reported. When setting it, the
pwm target duty cycle needs to be written. Since we don't know the actual
pwm duty cycle after a target pwm duty cycle has been written, set the
valid flag to false to indicate that actual pwm duty cycle should be read
from the chip instead of using cached values.
