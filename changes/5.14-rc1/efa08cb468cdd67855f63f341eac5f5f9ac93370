virtio/vdpa: clear the virtqueue state during probe

Clear the available index as part of the initialization process to
clear and values that might be left from previous usage of the device.
For example, if the device was previously used by vhost_vdpa and now
probed by vhost_vdpa, you want to start with indices.
