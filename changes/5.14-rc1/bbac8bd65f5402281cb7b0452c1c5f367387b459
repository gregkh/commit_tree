arm64: dts: rockchip: Enable USB3 for rk3328 Rock64

Enable USB3 nodes for the rk3328-based PINE Rock64 board.

The separate power regulator is not added as it is controlled by the
same GPIO line as the existing VBUS regulators, so it is already
enabled. Also there is no port representation to tie the regulator to.
