media: coda: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
added pm_runtime_resume_and_get() in order to automatically handle
dev->power.usage_count decrement on errors.

Use the new API, in order to cleanup the error check logic.

While here, as noted by Phillip, the labels at the coda_open()
function are currently named after what operation failed,
instead of what they do in response. So, change the name of
the error label that it is called when clk_enable fails,
in order to be consistent.
