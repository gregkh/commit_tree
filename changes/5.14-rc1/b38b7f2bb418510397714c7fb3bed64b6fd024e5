ice: Re-organizes reqstd/avail {R, T}XQ check/code for efficiency

If user has explicitly requested the number of {R,T}XQs, then it is
unnecessary to get the count of already available {R,T}XQs from the
PF avail_{r,t}xqs bitmap. This value will get overridden by user specified
value in any case.

Re-organize this code for improving the flow, readability and efficiency.
This scope of improvement was found during the review of the ICE driver
code.
