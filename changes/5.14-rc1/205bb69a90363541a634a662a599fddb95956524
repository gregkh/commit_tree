drm/dp: Handle zeroed port counts in drm_dp_read_downstream_info()

While the DP specification isn't entirely clear on if this should be
allowed or not, some branch devices report having downstream ports present
while also reporting a downstream port count of 0. So to avoid breaking
those devices, we need to handle this in drm_dp_read_downstream_info().

So, to do this we assume there's no downstream port info when the
downstream port count is 0.
