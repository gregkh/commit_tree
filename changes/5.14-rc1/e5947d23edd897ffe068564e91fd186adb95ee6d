mm: mempolicy: don't have to split pmd for huge zero page

When trying to migrate pages to obey mempolicy, the huge zero page is
split by inserting base zero pfn to all PTEs, then the page table walk
fallback to PTE level and just skips zero page.  Skipping zero page for
mempolicy has been the behavior of kernel since v2.6.16 due to commit
f4598c8b3678 ("[PATCH] migration: make sure there is no attempt to migrate
reserved pages.").  So it seems pointless to split huge zero page, it
could be just skipped like base zero page.

Set ACTION_CONTINUE to prevent the walk_page_range() split the pmd for
this case.
