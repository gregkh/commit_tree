io_uring: shuffle more fields into SQ ctx section

Since moving locked_free_* out of struct io_submit_state
ctx->submit_state is accessed on submission side only, so move it into
the submission section. Same goes for rsrc table pointers/nodes/etc.,
they must be taken and checked during submission because sync'ed by
uring_lock, so move them there as well.
