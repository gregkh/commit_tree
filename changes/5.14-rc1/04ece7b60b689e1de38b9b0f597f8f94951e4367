KVM: PPC: Book3S 64: Move hcall early register setup to KVM

System calls / hcalls have a different calling convention than
other interrupts, so there is code in the KVMTEST to massage these
into the same form as other interrupt handlers.

Move this work into the KVM hcall handler. This means teaching KVM
a little more about the low level interrupt handler setup, PACA save
areas, etc., although that's not obviously worse than the current
approach of coming up with an entirely different interrupt register
/ save convention.
