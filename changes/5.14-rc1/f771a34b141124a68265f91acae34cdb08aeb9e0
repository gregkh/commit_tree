serial: 8250: Dissociate 4MHz Titan ports from Oxford ports

Oxford Semiconductor PCIe (Tornado) serial port devices have their baud
base set incorrectly, however their `pciserial_board' entries have been
reused for Titan serial port devices.  Define own entries for the latter
devices then, carrying over the settings, so that Oxford entries can be
fixed.
