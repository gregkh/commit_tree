mxser: don't allocate MXSER_PORTS + 1

The MXSER_PORTS's tty_device is never registered and neither its
tty_port instance exists. Hence, it's quite pointless to allocate it.

It used to be used for global information fetches via ioctls. We have
just removed these as non-existent tty_device+tty_port was exactly the
reason to remove the ioctls.

It would be peculiar to add this "virtual" port as we require a backing
tty_port since commit ecbbfd44a08f (TTY: move tty buffers to tty_port)
in 2012.
