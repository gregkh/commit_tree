scsi: aha152x: Do not set message byte when calling scsi_done()

The done() function is called with a host_byte indicating the actual error
when the message byte is set. As the host byte takes precedence during
error recovery we can drop setting the message byte if the host byte is
set, too.  The only other case is when the host byte is DID_OK, but in that
case the message byte is always COMMAND_COMPLETE (i.e. 0), so we can drop
it there, too.
