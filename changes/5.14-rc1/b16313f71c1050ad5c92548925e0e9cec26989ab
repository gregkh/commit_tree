x86/fpu: Rename copy_xregs_to_kernel() and copy_kernel_to_xregs()

The function names for xsave[s]/xrstor[s] operations are horribly named and
a permanent source of confusion.

Rename:
	copy_xregs_to_kernel() to os_xsave()
	copy_kernel_to_xregs() to os_xrstor()

These are truly low level wrappers around the actual instructions
XSAVE[OPT]/XRSTOR and XSAVES/XRSTORS with the twist that the selection
based on the available CPU features happens with an alternative to avoid
conditionals all over the place and to provide the best performance for hot
paths.

The os_ prefix tells that this is the OS selected mechanism.

No functional change.
