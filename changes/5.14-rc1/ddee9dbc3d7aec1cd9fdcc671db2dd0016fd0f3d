net: core: devlink: add dropped stats traps field

Whenever query statistics is issued for trap, devlink subsystem
would also fill-in statistics 'dropped' field. This field indicates
the number of packets HW dropped and failed to report to the device driver,
and thus - to the devlink subsystem itself.
In case if device driver didn't register callback for hard drop
statistics querying, 'dropped' field will be omitted and not filled.
