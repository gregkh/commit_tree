selftests/sgx: Refine the test enclave to have storage

Extend the enclave to have two operations: ENCL_OP_PUT and ENCL_OP_GET.
ENCL_OP_PUT stores value inside the enclave address space and
ENCL_OP_GET reads it. The internal buffer can be later extended to be
variable size, and allow reclaimer tests.
