perf report: Fix --task and --stat with pipe input

Current 'perf report' fails to process a pipe input when --task or
--stat options are used.  This is because they reset all the tool
callbacks and fails to find a matching event for a sample.

When pipe input is used, the event info is passed via ATTR records so it
needs to handle that operation.  Otherwise the following error occurs.
Note, -14 (= -EFAULT) comes from evlist__parse_sample():

  # perf record -a -o- sleep 1 | perf report -i- --stat
  Can't parse sample, err = -14
  0x271044 [0x38]: failed to process type: 9
  Error:
  failed to process sample
  #

Committer testing:

Before:

  $ perf record -o- sleep 1 | perf report -i- --stat
  Can't parse sample, err = -14
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  0x1350 [0x30]: failed to process type: 9
  Error:
  failed to process sample
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.000 MB - ]
  $

After:

  $ perf record -o- sleep 1 | perf report -i- --stat
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.000 MB - ]

  Aggregated stats:
             TOTAL events:         41
              COMM events:          2  ( 4.9%)
              EXIT events:          1  ( 2.4%)
            SAMPLE events:          9  (22.0%)
             MMAP2 events:          4  ( 9.8%)
              ATTR events:          1  ( 2.4%)
    FINISHED_ROUND events:          1  ( 2.4%)
        THREAD_MAP events:          1  ( 2.4%)
           CPU_MAP events:          1  ( 2.4%)
      EVENT_UPDATE events:          1  ( 2.4%)
         TIME_CONV events:          1  ( 2.4%)
           FEATURE events:         19  (46.3%)
  cycles:uhH stats:
            SAMPLE events:          9
