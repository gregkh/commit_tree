arm64: dts: rockchip: Enable USB3 Ethernet on rk3328 NanoPi R2S

The NanoPi R2S has a Realtek RTL8153B USB 3.0 Ethernet chip connected
to the USB 3.0 pins of the RK3328 SoC. Power to the chip is controlled
by a GPIO line toggled transistor switch, which is not a full-blown
voltage regulator.

At least in Linux, the USB 3.0 XHCI controller has two ports: the first
port is for legacy USB 2.0 and slower, while the second port is for USB
3.0. Since the Ethernet chip supports USB 3.0, it should be described
as connected to the second port.

Add the device nodes for the power switch and Ethernet chip, and enable
the USB 3.0 controller. The USB device node follows the standard USB
device binding.
