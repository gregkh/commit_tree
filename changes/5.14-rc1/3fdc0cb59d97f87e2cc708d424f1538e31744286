arm64: smccc: Add support for SMCCCv1.2 extended input/output registers

SMCCC v1.2 allows x8-x17 to be used as parameter registers and x4â€”x17
to be used as result registers in SMC64/HVC64. Arm Firmware Framework
for Armv8-A specification makes use of x0-x7 as parameter and result
registers. There are other users like Hyper-V who intend to use beyond
x0-x7 as well.

Current SMCCC interface in the kernel just use x0-x7 as parameter and
x0-x3 as result registers as required by SMCCCv1.0. Let us add new
interface to support this extended set of input/output registers namely
x0-x17 as both parameter and result registers.
