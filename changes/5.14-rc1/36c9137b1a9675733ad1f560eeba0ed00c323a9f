drm/amd/display: Add audio support for DFP type of active branch is DP case

[Why]
Per DP spec, for active protocol convertor adaptor, DP source should enable audio
for DFP type is DP, HDMI or DP++. Current is_dp_active_dongle() checking is not
precise, which treat branch device default as active dongle. As a result, we will
mistakenly disable audio for DFP type is DP case.

[How]
Make is_dp_active_dongle() checking more precise for active dongle types.
Rename active diongle type as SST branch device in case confusion.
