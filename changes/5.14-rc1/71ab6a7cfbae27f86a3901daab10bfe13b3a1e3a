vdpa/mlx5: Fix possible failure in umem size calculation

umem size is a 32 bit unsigned value so assigning it to an int could
cause false failures. Set the calculated value inside the function and
modify function name to reflect the fact it updates the size.

This bug was found during code review but never had real impact to this
date.
