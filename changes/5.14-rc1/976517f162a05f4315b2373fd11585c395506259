io_uring: fix blocking inline submission

There is a complaint against sys_io_uring_enter() blocking if it submits
stdin reads. The problem is in __io_file_supports_async(), which
sees that it's a cdev and allows it to be processed inline.

Punt char devices using generic rules of io_file_supports_async(),
including checking for presence of *_iter() versions of rw callbacks.
Apparently, it will affect most of cdevs with some exceptions like
null and zero devices.
