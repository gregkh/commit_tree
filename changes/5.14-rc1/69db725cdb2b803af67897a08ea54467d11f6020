arm64: dts: ti: k3-am654x/j721e/j7200-common-proc-board: Fix MCU_RGMII1_TXC direction

The MCU RGMII MCU_RGMII1_TXC pin is defined as input by mistake, although
this does not make any difference functionality wise it's better to update
to avoid confusion.

Hence fix MCU RGMII MCU_RGMII1_TXC pin pinmux definitions to be an output
in K3 am654x/j721e/j7200 board files.
