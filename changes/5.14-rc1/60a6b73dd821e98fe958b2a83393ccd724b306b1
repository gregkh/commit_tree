drm/ingenic: Fix pixclock rate for 24-bit serial panels

When using a 24-bit panel on a 8-bit serial bus, the pixel clock
requested by the panel has to be multiplied by 3, since the subpixels
are shifted sequentially.

The code (in ingenic_drm_encoder_atomic_check) already computed
crtc_state->adjusted_mode->crtc_clock accordingly, but clk_set_rate()
used crtc_state->adjusted_mode->clock instead.
