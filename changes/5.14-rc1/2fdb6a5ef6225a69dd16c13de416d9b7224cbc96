drm/i915/display: Remove a redundant function argument from intel_psr_enable_source()

It removes intel_crtc_state from function argument of
intel_psr_enable_source() in order to use intel_psr_enable_source()
without intel_crtc_state on other psr internal functions.
And we can get cpu_trancoder from intel_psr, therefore we don't need to
pass intel_crtc_state to this function.
