iio: light: tsl2583: Balance runtime pm + use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Error paths in read_raw() and write_raw() callbacks failed to perform and
type of runtime pm put().  Remove called pm_runtime_put_noidle()
but there is no equivalent get (this is safe because the reference
count is protected against going below zero, but it is misleading.

Whilst here use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to replace boilerplate.
