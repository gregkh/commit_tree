lib: vsprintf: scanf: Negative number must have field width > 1

If a signed number field starts with a '-' the field width must be > 1,
or unlimited, to allow at least one digit after the '-'.

This patch adds a check for this. If a signed field starts with '-'
and field_width == 1 the scanf will quit.

It is ok for a signed number field to have a field width of 1 if it
starts with a digit. In that case the single digit can be converted.
