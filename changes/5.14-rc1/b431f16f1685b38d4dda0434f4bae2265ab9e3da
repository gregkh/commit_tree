ALSA: firewire-motu: add support for MOTU 896

MOTU 896 is a second model in MOTU FireWire series, produced in 2001. This
model consists of three chips:

 * Texas Instruments TSB41AB2 (Physical layer for IEEE 1394 bus)
 * Philips Semiconductors PDI 1394L21BE (Link layer for IEEE 1394 bus and
   packet processing layer)
 * QuickLogic QuickRAM QL4016 (Data block processing layer and digital
   signal processing)

This commit adds a support for the model, with its unique protocol as
version 1. The features of this protocol are:

 * no MIDI support.
 * Rx packets have no data chunks for control and status messages.
 * Tx packets have 2 bytes for control and status messages in the end of
   each data block.
 * The most of settings are represented in bit flag in one quadlet address
   (0x'ffff'f000'0b14).
 * It's selectable to use signal on optical interface, however the device
   has no register specific to it. The state has effect just to whether
   to exclude differed data chunks.
 * The internal multiplexer is not configured by software.

Just after powering on, the device has a quirk to fail handling
transaction. I recommend users to connect the device enough after powering
on.
