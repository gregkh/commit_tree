ACPI: PM: Adjust behavior for field problems on AMD systems

Some AMD Systems with uPEP _HID AMD004/AMDI005 have an off by one bug
in their function mask return.  This means that they will call entrance
but not exit for matching functions.

Other AMD systems with this HID should use the Microsoft generic UUID.

AMD systems with uPEP HID AMDI006 should be using the Microsoft method.
