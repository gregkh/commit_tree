staging: mt7621-dts: review pcie overlay in 'gbpc1' dts file

pcie node is being overlayed in 'gbpc1.dts' file requesting three
gpio reset pins for each pcie port. Gnubee only needs general
gpio 19 to properly reset and make all of them work. This pin
is already requested in the general 'mt7621.dtsi' file as well
as is the pinctrl pins. So we only need to enable the node
in the overlay and all the other stuff can be safely deleted.
Also, pin 8 is being requested for gpio-leds node and there
was an error on boot before this changes because of pin was
already assigned (EBUSY):

leds-gpio: probe of gpio-leds failed with error -16

With this changes this error has disappear and the board is
properly booting without any other regression.
