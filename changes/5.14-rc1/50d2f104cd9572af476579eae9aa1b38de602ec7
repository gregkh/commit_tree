powerpc/32s: Allow disabling KUEP at boot time

PPC64 uses MMU features to enable/disable KUEP at boot time.
But feature fixups are applied way too early on PPC32.

Now that all KUEP related actions are in C following the
conversion of KUEP initial setup and context switch in C,
static branches can be used to enable/disable KUEP.
