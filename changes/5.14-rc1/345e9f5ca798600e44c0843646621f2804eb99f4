soundwire: bus: only use CLOCK_STOP_MODE0 and fix confusions

Existing devices and implementations only support the required
CLOCK_STOP_MODE0. All the code related to CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 has not
been tested and is highly questionable, with a clear confusion between
CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 and the simple clock stop state machine.

This patch removes all usages of CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 - which has no
impact on any solution - and fixes the use of the simple clock stop
state machine. The resulting code should be a lot more symmetrical and
easier to maintain.

Note that CLOCK_STOP_MODE1 is not supported in the SoundWire Device
Class specification so it's rather unlikely that we need to re-add
this mode later.
