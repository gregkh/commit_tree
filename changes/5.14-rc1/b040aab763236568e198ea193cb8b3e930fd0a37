net: phy: probe for C45 PHYs that return PHY ID of zero in C22 space

PHY devices such as the Marvell Alaska 88E2110 does not return a valid
PHY ID when probed using Clause-22. The current implementation treats
PHY ID of zero as a non-error and valid PHY ID, and causing the PHY
device failed to bind to the Marvell driver.

For such devices, we do an additional probe in the Clause-45 space,
if a valid PHY ID is returned, we then proceed to attach the PHY
device to the matching PHY ID driver.
