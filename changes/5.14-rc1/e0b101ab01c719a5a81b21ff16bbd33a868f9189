watchdog: imx2_wdt: avoid to ping before resume back

Since watchdog_ping_work is not freezable so that it maybe scheduled before
imx2_wdt_resume where watchdog clock enabled, hence, kernel will hang in
imx2_wdt_ping without clock, and then watchdog reset happen. Add clk_is_on
to prevent the above case by ignoring ping until watchdog driver resume
back indeed.
