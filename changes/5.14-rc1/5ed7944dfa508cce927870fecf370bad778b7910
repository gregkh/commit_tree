drm/msm/dp: Drop unnecessary NULL checks after container_of

The result of container_of() operations is never NULL unless the embedded
element is the first element of the structure. This is not the case here.
The NULL check on the result of container_of() is therefore unnecessary
and misleading. Remove it.

This change was made automatically with the following Coccinelle script.

@@
type t;
identifier v;
statement s;
@@

<+...
(
  t v = container_of(...);
|
  v = container_of(...);
)
  ...
  when != v
- if (\( !v \| v == NULL \) ) s
...+>

While at it, remove unused but assigned variable hpd in
dp_display_usbpd_attention_cb().
