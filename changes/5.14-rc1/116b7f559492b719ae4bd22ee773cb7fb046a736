arm64: Do not enable uaccess for flush_icache_range

__flush_icache_range works on kernel addresses, and doesn't need
uaccess. The existing code is a side-effect of its current
implementation with __flush_cache_user_range fallthrough.

Instead of fallthrough to share the code, use a common macro for
the two where the caller specifies an optional fixup label if
user access is needed. If provided, this label would be used to
generate an extable entry.

Simplify the code to use dcache_by_line_op, instead of
replicating much of its functionality.

No functional change intended.
Possible performance impact due to the reduced number of
instructions.
