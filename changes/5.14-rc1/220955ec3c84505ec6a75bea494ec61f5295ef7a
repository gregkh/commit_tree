media: renesas-ceu: Properly check for PM errors

Right now, the driver just assumes that PM runtime resume
worked, but it may fail.

Well, the pm_runtime_get_sync() internally increments the
dev->power.usage_count without decrementing it, even on errors.

So, using it is tricky. Let's replace it by the new
pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), introduced by:
commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")
and return an error if something bad happens.

This should ensure that the PM runtime usage_count will be
properly decremented if an error happens at open time.
