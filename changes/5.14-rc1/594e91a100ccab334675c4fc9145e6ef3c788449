KVM: x86/mmu: Add struct and helpers to retrieve MMU role bits from regs

Introduce "struct kvm_mmu_role_regs" to hold the register state that is
incorporated into the mmu_role.  For nested TDP, the register state that
is factored into the MMU isn't vCPU state; the dedicated struct will be
used to propagate the correct state throughout the flows without having
to pass multiple params, and also provides helpers for the various flag
accessors.

Intentionally make the new helpers cumbersome/ugly by prepending four
underscores.  In the not-too-distant future, it will be preferable to use
the mmu_role to query bits as the mmu_role can drop irrelevant bits
without creating contradictions, e.g. clearing CR4 bits when CR0.PG=0.
Reserve the clean helper names (no underscores) for the mmu_role.

Add a helper for vCPU conversion, which is the common case.

No functional change intended.
