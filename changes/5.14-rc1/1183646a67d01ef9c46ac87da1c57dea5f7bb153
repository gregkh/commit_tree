KVM: SVM: hyper-v: Direct Virtual Flush support

From Hyper-V TLFS:
 "The hypervisor exposes hypercalls (HvFlushVirtualAddressSpace,
  HvFlushVirtualAddressSpaceEx, HvFlushVirtualAddressList, and
  HvFlushVirtualAddressListEx) that allow operating systems to more
  efficiently manage the virtual TLB. The L1 hypervisor can choose to
  allow its guest to use those hypercalls and delegate the responsibility
  to handle them to the L0 hypervisor. This requires the use of a
  partition assist page."

Add the Direct Virtual Flush support for SVM.
