kvfree_rcu: Use [READ/WRITE]_ONCE() macros to access to nr_bkv_objs

nr_bkv_objs is a count of the objects in the kvfree_rcu page cache.
Accessing it requires holding the ->lock.  Switch to READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() macros to provide lockless access to this counter.
This lockless access is used for the shrinker.
