MIPS: CI20: Add second percpu timer for SMP.

1.Add a new TCU channel as the percpu timer of core1, this is to
  prepare for the subsequent SMP support. The newly added channel
  will not adversely affect the current single-core state.
2.Adjust the position of TCU node to make it consistent with the
  order in jz4780.dtsi file.
