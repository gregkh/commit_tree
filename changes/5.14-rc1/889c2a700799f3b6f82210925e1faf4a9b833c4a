cifs: fix check of dfs interlinks

Interlink is a special type of DFS link that resolves to a different
DFS domain-based namespace.  To determine whether it is an interlink
or not, check if ReferralServers and StorageServers bits are set to 1
and 0 respectively in ReferralHeaderFlags, as specified in MS-DFSC
3.1.5.4.5 Determining Whether a Referral Response is an Interlink.
