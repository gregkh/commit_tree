serial: fsl_lpuart: disable DMA for console and fix sysrq

SYSRQ doesn't work with DMA. This is because there is no error
indication whether a symbol had a framing error or not. Actually,
this is not completely correct, there is a bit in the data register
which is set in this case, but we'd have to read change the DMA access
to 16 bit and we'd need to post process the data, thus make the DMA
pointless in the first place.
