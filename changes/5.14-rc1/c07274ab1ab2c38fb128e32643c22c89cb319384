net/mlx5e: IPsec/rep_tc: Fix rep_tc_update_skb drops IPsec packet

rep_tc copy REG_C1 to REG_B. IPsec crypto utilizes the whole REG_B
register with BIT31 as IPsec marker. rep_tc_update_skb drops
IPsec because it thought REG_B contains bad value.

In previous patch, BIT 31 of REG_C1 is reserved for IPsec.
Skip the rep_tc_update_skb if BIT31 of REG_B is set.
