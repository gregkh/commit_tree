power: supply: cpcap-battery: invalidate config when incompatible measurements are read

This invalidates empty->counter_uah and charge_full when charge_now
indicates that they are grossly wrong and adds some tolerance to
POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGE_FULL to allow for inaccuracies in the charge
counter and manufacturing tolerances in the battery.
