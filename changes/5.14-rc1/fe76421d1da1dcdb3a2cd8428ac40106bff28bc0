io_uring: allow user configurable IO thread CPU affinity

io-wq defaults to per-node masks for IO workers. This works fine by
default, but isn't particularly handy for workloads that prefer more
specific affinities, for either performance or isolation reasons.

This adds IORING_REGISTER_IOWQ_AFF that allows the user to pass in a CPU
mask that is then applied to IO thread workers, and an
IORING_UNREGISTER_IOWQ_AFF that simply resets the masks back to the
default of per-node.

Note that no care is given to existing IO threads, they will need to go
through a reschedule before the affinity is correct if they are already
running or sleeping.
