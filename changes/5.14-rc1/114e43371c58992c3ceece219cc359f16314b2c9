tpm_tis_spi: set default probe function if device id not match

In DSDT table, TPM _CID was SMO0768, and no _HID definition. After a
kernel upgrade from 4.19 to 5.10, TPM probe function was changed which
causes device probe fails. In order to make newer kernel to be
compatible with the older acpi definition, it would be best set default
probe function.
