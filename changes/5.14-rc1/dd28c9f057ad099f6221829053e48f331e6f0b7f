kvfree_rcu: Update "monitor_todo" once a batch is started

Before attempting to start a new batch the "monitor_todo" variable is
set to "false" and set back to "true" when a previous RCU batch is still
in progress.  This is at best confusing.

Thus change this variable to "false" only when a new batch has been
successfully queued, otherwise, just leave it be.
