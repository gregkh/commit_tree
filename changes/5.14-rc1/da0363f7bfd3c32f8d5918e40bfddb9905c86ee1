ASoC: qcom: Fix for DMA interrupt clear reg overwriting

The DMA interrupt clear register overwritten during
simultaneous playback and capture in lpass platform
interrupt handler. It's causing playback or capture stuck
in similtaneous plaback on speaker and capture on dmic test.
Update appropriate reg fields of corresponding channel instead
of entire register write.

Fixes: commit c5c8635a04711 ("ASoC: qcom: Add LPASS platform driver")
