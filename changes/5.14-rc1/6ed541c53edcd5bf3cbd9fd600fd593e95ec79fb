thunderbolt: Allocate credits according to router preferences

The USB4 Connection Manager guide provides detailed information how the
USB4 router buffer (credit) allocation information should be used by the
connection manager when it allocates buffers for different paths. This
patch implements it for Linux. For USB 3.x and DisplayPort we use
directly the router preferences. The rest of the buffer space is then
used for PCIe and DMA (peer-to-peer, XDomain) traffic. DMA tunnels
require at least one buffer and PCIe six, so if there is not enough
buffers we fail the tunnel creation.

For the legacy Thunderbolt 1-3 devices we use the existing hard-coded
scheme except for DMA where we use the values suggested by the USB4 spec
chapter 13.
