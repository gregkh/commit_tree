powerpc/interrupt: Rename and lightly change syscall_exit_prepare_main()

Rename syscall_exit_prepare_main() into interrupt_exit_prepare_main()

Pass it the 'ret' so that it can 'or' it directly instead of
oring twice, once inside the function and once outside.

And remove 'r3' parameter which is not used.
