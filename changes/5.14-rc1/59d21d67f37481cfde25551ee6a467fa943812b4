KVM: SVM: Software reserved fields

SVM added support for certain reserved fields to be used by
software or hypervisor. Add the following reserved fields:
  - VMCB offset 0x3e0 - 0x3ff
  - Clean bit 31
  - SVM intercept exit code 0xf0000000

Later patches will make use of this for supporting Hyper-V
nested virtualization enhancements.
