drm: Fix for GEM buffers with write-combine memory

The previous commit wrongly assumed that dma_mmap_wc() could be replaced
by pgprot_writecombine() + dma_mmap_pages(). It did work on my setup,
but did not work everywhere.

Use dma_mmap_wc() when the buffer has the write-combine cache attribute,
and dma_mmap_pages() when it has the non-coherent cache attribute.
