media: hantro: add support for Rockchip RK3066

RK3066's VPU IP block is the predecessor from what RK3288 has.
The hardware differences are:
  - supports decoding frame sizes up to 1920x1088 only
  - doesn't have the 'G1_REG_SOFT_RESET' register
    (requires another .reset callback for hantro_codec_ops,
     since writing this register will result in non-working
     IP block)
  - has one ACLK/HCLK per vdpu/vepu
  - ACLKs can be clocked up to 300 MHz only
  - no MMU
    (no changes required: CMA will be transparently used)

Add a new RK3066 variant which reflect this differences. This variant
can be used for RK3188 as well.
