drm/amdkfd: add svm range validate timestamp

With xnack on, add validate timestamp in order to handle GPU vm fault
from multiple GPUs.

If GPU retry fault need migrate the range to the best restore location,
use range validate timestamp to record system timestamp after range is
restored to update GPU page table.

Because multiple pages of same range have multiple retry fault, define
AMDGPU_SVM_RANGE_RETRY_FAULT_PENDING to the long time period that
pending retry fault may still comes after page table update, to skip
duplicate retry fault of same range.

If difference between system timestamp and range last validate timestamp
is bigger than AMDGPU_SVM_RANGE_RETRY_FAULT_PENDING, that means the
retry fault is from another GPU, then continue to handle retry fault
recover.
