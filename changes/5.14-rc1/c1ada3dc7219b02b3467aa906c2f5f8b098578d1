ucounts: Set ucount_max to the largest positive value the type can hold

The ns->ucount_max[] is signed long which is less than the rlimit size.
We have to protect ucount_max[] from overflow and only use the largest
value that we can hold.

On 32bit using "long" instead of "unsigned long" to hold the counts has
the downside that RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE and RLIMIT_MEMLOCK are limited to 2GiB
instead of 4GiB. I don't think anyone cares but it should be mentioned
in case someone does.

The RLIMIT_NPROC and RLIMIT_SIGPENDING used atomic_t so their maximum
hasn't changed.
