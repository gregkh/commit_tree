mm/thp: fix strncpy warning

Using MAX_INPUT_BUF_SZ as the maximum length of the string makes fortify
complain as it thinks the string might be longer than the buffer, and if
it is, we will end up with a "string" that is missing a NUL terminator.
It's trivial to show that 'tok' points to a NUL-terminated string which is
less than MAX_INPUT_BUF_SZ in length, so we may as well just use strcpy()
and avoid the warning.
