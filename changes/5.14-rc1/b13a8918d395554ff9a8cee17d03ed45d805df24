io_uring: better locality for rsrc fields

ring has two types of resource-related fields: used for request
submission, and field needed for update/registration. Reshuffle them
into these two groups for better locality and readability. The second
group is not in the hot path, so it's natural to place them somewhere in
the end. Also update an outdated comment.
