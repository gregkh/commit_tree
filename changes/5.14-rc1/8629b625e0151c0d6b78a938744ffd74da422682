KVM: nVMX: Request to sync eVMCS from VMCS12 after migration

VMCS12 is used to keep the authoritative state during nested state
migration. In case 'need_vmcs12_to_shadow_sync' flag is set, we're
in between L2->L1 vmexit and L1 guest run when actual sync to
enlightened (or shadow) VMCS happens. Nested state, however, has
no flag for 'need_vmcs12_to_shadow_sync' so vmx_set_nested_state()->
set_current_vmptr() always sets it. Enlightened vmptrld path, however,
doesn't have the quirk so some VMCS12 changes may not get properly
reflected to eVMCS and L1 will see an incorrect state.

Note, during L2 execution or when need_vmcs12_to_shadow_sync is not
set the change is effectively a nop: in the former case all changes
will get reflected during the first L2->L1 vmexit and in the later
case VMCS12 and eVMCS are already in sync (thanks to
copy_enlightened_to_vmcs12() in vmx_get_nested_state()).
