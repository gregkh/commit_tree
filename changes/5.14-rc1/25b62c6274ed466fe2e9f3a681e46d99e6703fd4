KVM: nVMX: Free only guest_mode (L2) roots on INVVPID w/o EPT

When emulating INVVPID for L1, free only L2+ roots, using the guest_mode
tag in the MMU role to identify L2+ roots.  From L1's perspective, its
own TLB entries use VPID=0, and INVVPID is not requied to invalidate such
entries.  Per Intel's SDM, INVVPID _may_ invalidate entries with VPID=0,
but it is not required to do so.
