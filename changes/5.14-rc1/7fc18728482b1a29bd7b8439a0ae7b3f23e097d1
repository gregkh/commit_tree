dm: move zone related code to dm-zone.c

Move core and table code used for zoned targets and conditionally
defined with #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED to the new file dm-zone.c.
This file is conditionally compiled depending on CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED.
The small helper dm_set_zones_restrictions() is introduced to
initialize a mapped device request queue zone attributes in
dm_table_set_restrictions().
