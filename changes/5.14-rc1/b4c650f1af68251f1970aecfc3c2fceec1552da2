media: atomisp: remove compat_ioctl32 code

This is one of the last remaining users of compat_alloc_user_space()
and copy_in_user(), which are in the process of getting removed.

As of commit 57e6b6f2303e ("media: atomisp_fops.c: disable
atomisp_compat_ioctl32"), nothing in this file is actually getting used
as the only reference has been stubbed out.

Remove the entire file -- anyone willing to restore the functionality
can equally well just look up the contents in the git history if needed.
