x86/events/intel: Do not deploy TSX force abort workaround when TSX is deprecated

Earlier workaround added by

  400816f60c54 ("perf/x86/intel: Implement support for TSX Force Abort")

for perf counter interactions [1] are not required on some client
systems which received a microcode update that deprecates TSX.

Bypass the perf workaround when such microcode is enumerated.

[1] [ bp: Look for document ID 604224, "Performance Monitoring Impact
      of Intel Transactional Synchronization Extension Memory". Since
      there's no way for us to have stable links to documents... ]

 [ bp: Massage comment. ]
