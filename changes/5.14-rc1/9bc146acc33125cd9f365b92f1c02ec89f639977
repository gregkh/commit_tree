regulator: hi6421v600: Fix setting wrong driver_data

Current code set "config.driver_data = sreg" but sreg only init the mutex,
the othere fields are just zero. Fix it by pass *info to config.driver_data
so each regulator can get corresponding data by rdev_get_drvdata().

Separate enable_mutex from struct hi6421_spmi_reg_info since only need one
mutex for the driver.
