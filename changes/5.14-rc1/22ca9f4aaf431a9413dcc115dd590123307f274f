crypto: shash - avoid comparing pointers to exported functions under CFI

crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() is implemented by testing whether the
.setkey() member of a struct shash_alg points to the default version,
called shash_no_setkey(). As crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() is a static
inline, this requires shash_no_setkey() to be exported to modules.

Unfortunately, when building with CFI, function pointers are routed
via CFI stubs which are private to each module (or to the kernel proper)
and so this function pointer comparison may fail spuriously.

Let's fix this by turning crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey() into an out of
line function.
