tick/nohz: Conditionally restart tick on idle exit

In nohz_full mode, switching from idle to a task will unconditionally
issue a tick restart. If the task is alone in the runqueue or is the
highest priority, the tick will fire once then eventually stop. But that
alone is still undesired noise.

Therefore, only restart the tick on idle exit when it's strictly
necessary.
