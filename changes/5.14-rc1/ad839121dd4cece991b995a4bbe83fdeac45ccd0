ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix index used in inner loop

With more warnings than the default, Sparse throws the following
warning:

sound/soc/sof/intel/hda.c:1127:49: error: self-comparison always
evaluates to true
sound/soc/sof/intel/hda.c:1128:49: error: self-comparison always
evaluates to true
sound/soc/sof/intel/hda.c:1129:48: error: self-comparison always
evaluates to true

This looks like an obvious error, with a likely copy-pasted line
leading to the use of the wrong index in an inner loop. One of the
worst single-character bugs in a long time.

This problem was not detected in our tests since in practice SoundWire
platforms only have identical devices per link and the index mistake
did not change the results.
