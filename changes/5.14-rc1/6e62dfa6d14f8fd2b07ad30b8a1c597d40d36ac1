kunit: Do not typecheck binary assertions

The use of typecheck() in KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ() and friends is causing more
problems than I think it's worth. Things like enums need to have their
values explicitly cast, and literals all need to be very precisely
typed, else a large warning will be printed.

While typechecking does have its uses, the additional overhead of having
lots of needless casts -- combined with the awkward error messages which
don't mention which types are involved -- makes tests less readable and
more difficult to write.

By removing the typecheck() call, the two arguments still need to be of
compatible types, but don't need to be of exactly the same time, which
seems a less confusing and more useful compromise.
