drm/i915: drop the __i915_active_call pointer packing

We use some of the lower bits of the retire function pointer for
potential flags, which is quite thorny, since the caller needs to
remember to give the function the correct alignment with
__i915_active_call, otherwise we might incorrectly unpack the pointer
and jump to some garbage address later. Instead of all this let's just
pass the flags along as a separate parameter.
