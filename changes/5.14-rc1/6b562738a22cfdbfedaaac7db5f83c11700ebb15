dt-binding: mtd: nand: Document the cs-gpios property

To reach higher capacities, arrays of chips are now pretty common.
Unfortunately, most of the controllers have been designed a decade ago
and did not all anticipate the need for several chip-selects. The new
cs-gpios property allows to workaround this limitation by adding as many
GPIO chip-select as needed.
