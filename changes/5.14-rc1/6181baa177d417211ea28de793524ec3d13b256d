clk: lmk04832: add support for digital delay

The digital delay allows outputs to be delayed from 8 to 1023 VCO
cycles. The delay step can be as small as half the period of the clock
distribution path. For example, a 3.2-GHz VCO frequency results in
156.25-ps steps.  The digital delay value takes effect on the clock
output phase after a SYNC event.

This is required to support JESD204B subclass 1.
