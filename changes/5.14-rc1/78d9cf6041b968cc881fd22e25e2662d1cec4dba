mm/mmap.c: logic of find_vma_intersection repeated in __do_munmap

Logic of find_vma_intersection() is repeated in __do_munmap().

Also, prev is assigned a value before checking vma->vm_start >= end which
might end up on a return statement making that assignment useless.

Calling find_vma_intersection() checks that condition and returns NULL if
no vma is found, hence only the !vma check is needed in __do_munmap().
