octeontx2-af: add new mailbox to configure VF trust mode

Add new mailbox to enable PF to configure VF as trusted VF.
Trusted VF feature allows VFs to perform priviliged operations
such as enabling VF promiscuous mode, all-multicast mode and
changing the VF MAC address configured by PF. Refactored the
VF interface flags maintained by the AF driver such that the
flags do not overlap for various configurations.
