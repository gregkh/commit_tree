KVM: arm64: Restore PMU configuration on first run

Restoring a guest with an active virtual PMU results in no perf
counters being instanciated on the host side. Not quite what
you'd expect from a restore.

In order to fix this, force a writeback of PMCR_EL0 on the first
run of a vcpu (using a new request so that it happens once the
vcpu has been loaded). This will in turn create all the host-side
counters that were missing.
