arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: Move gpio.h inclusion to SoC DTSI

Almost any board that boots and has a way to interact with it
(say for the rare cases of just-pstore or let's-rely-on-bootloader-setup)
needs to set some GPIOs, so it makes no sense to include gpio.h separately
each time. Hence move it to SoC DTSI.
