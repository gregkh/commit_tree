selftests: kvm: Allows userspace to handle emulation errors.

This test exercises the feature KVM_CAP_EXIT_ON_EMULATION_FAILURE.  When
enabled, errors in the in-kernel instruction emulator are forwarded to
userspace with the instruction bytes stored in the exit struct for
KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR.  So, when the guest attempts to emulate an
'flds' instruction, which isn't able to be emulated in KVM, instead
of failing, KVM sends the instruction to userspace to handle.

For this test to work properly the module parameter
'allow_smaller_maxphyaddr' has to be set.
