drm/amdkfd: add ioctl to configure and query xnack retries

Xnack retries are used for page fault recovery. Some AMD chip
families support continuously retry while page table entries are invalid.
The driver must handle the page fault interrupt and fill in a valid entry
for the GPU to continue.

This ioctl allows to enable/disable XNACK retries per KFD process.
