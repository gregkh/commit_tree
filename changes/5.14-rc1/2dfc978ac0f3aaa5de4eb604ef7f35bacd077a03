media: staging: media: atomisp: replace raw pr_*() by dev_dbg()

It is recommended to use driver model diagnostic macros dev_*() instead
of raw printk() or pr_*() since the former ensures that the log messages
are always associated with the corresponding device and driver. This also
addresses the checkpatch complain for not using KERN_<LEVEL> facility in
printk() call.
