media: v4l2-core: return -ENODEV from ioctl when not registered

I spotted a minor difference is handling of unregistered devices
between native and compat ioctls: the native handler never tries
to call into the driver if a device is not marked as registered.

I did not check whether this can cause issues in the kernel, or
just a different between return codes, but it clearly makes
sense that both should behave the same way.
