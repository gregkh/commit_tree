ARM: tegra: wm8903: Fix polarity of headphones-detection GPIO in device-trees

All Tegra boards which use WM8903 audio codec are specifying a wrong
polarity for the headphones detection GPIO. The kernel driver hardcodes
the polarity to active-low, which is the correct polarity, so we can fix
the device-trees safely.
