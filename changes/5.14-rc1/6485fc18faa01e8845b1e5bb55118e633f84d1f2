ACPI: Add quirks for AMD Renoir/Lucienne CPUs to force the D3 hint

AMD systems from Renoir and Lucienne require that the NVME controller
is put into D3 over a Modern Standby / suspend-to-idle
cycle.  This is "typically" accomplished using the `StorageD3Enable`
property in the _DSD, but this property was introduced after many
of these systems launched and most OEM systems don't have it in
their BIOS.

On AMD Renoir without these drives going into D3 over suspend-to-idle
the resume will fail with the NVME controller being reset and a trace
like this in the kernel logs:
```
[   83.556118] nvme nvme0: I/O 161 QID 2 timeout, aborting
[   83.556178] nvme nvme0: I/O 162 QID 2 timeout, aborting

[   95.332936] nvme 0000:03:00.0: PM: failed to resume async: error -16
```

The Microsoft documentation for StorageD3Enable mentioned that Windows has
a hardcoded allowlist for D3 support, which was used for these platforms.
Introduce quirks to hardcode them for Linux as well.

As this property is now "standardized", OEM systems using AMD Cezanne and
newer APU's have adopted this property, and quirks like this should not be
necessary.
