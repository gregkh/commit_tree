igb: handle vlan types with checker enabled

The sparse build (C=2) finds some issues with how the driver
dealt with the (very difficult) hardware that in some generations
uses little-endian, and in others uses big endian, for the VLAN
field. The code as written picks __le16 as a type and for some
hardware revisions we override it to __be16 as done in this
patch. This impacted the VF driver as well so fix it there too.

Also change the vlan_tci assignment to override the sparse
warning without changing functionality.
