KVM: x86: Use KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST to handle INVPCID(ALL) emulation

Use KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST instead of KVM_REQ_MMU_RELOAD when emulating
INVPCID of all contexts.  In the current code, this is a glorified nop as
TLB_FLUSH_GUEST becomes kvm_mmu_unload(), same as MMU_RELOAD, when TDP
is disabled, which is the only time INVPCID is only intercepted+emulated.
In the future, reusing TLB_FLUSH_GUEST will simplify optimizing paths
that emulate a guest TLB flush, e.g. by synchronizing as needed instead
of completely unloading all MMUs.
