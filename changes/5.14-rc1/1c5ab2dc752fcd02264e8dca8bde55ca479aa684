ASoC: SOF: Intel: byt: prepare split between Baytrail and Merrifield

Atom devices are split in ACPI (Baytrail/Cherrytrail) and
PCI (Merrifield) cases. In preparation for a split between the two
parts and the use of a common module, rename functions with the atom_
prefix when appropriate and remove explicit BYT_ prefix for common
definitions.

This patch should not change any functionality.
