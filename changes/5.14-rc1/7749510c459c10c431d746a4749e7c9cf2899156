ARM: dts: ux500: Fix LED probing

The Ux500 HREF LEDs have not been probing properly for a
while as this was introduce:

     ret = of_property_read_u32(np, "color", &led_color);
     if (ret)
             return ret;

Since the device tree did not define the new invented color
attribute, probe was failing.

Define color attributes for the LEDs so they work again.
