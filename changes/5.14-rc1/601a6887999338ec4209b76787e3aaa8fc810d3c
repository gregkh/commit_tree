w1: ds2482: fix kernel-doc syntax in file

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
The comments for drivers/w1/masters/ds2482.c follows this syntax, but
the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.

Similarly, the syntax for function and arguments declaration as well.

Fix all such occurrences appropriately.
