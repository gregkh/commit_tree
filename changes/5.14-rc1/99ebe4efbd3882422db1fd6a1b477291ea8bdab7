io_uring: pre-initialise some of req fields

Most of requests are allocated from an internal cache, so it's waste of
time fully initialising them every time. Instead, let's pre-init some of
the fields we can during initial allocation (e.g. kmalloc(), see
io_alloc_req()) and keep them valid on request recycling. There are four
of them in this patch:

->ctx is always stays the same
->link is NULL on free, it's an invariant
->result is not even needed to init, just a precaution
->async_data we now clean in io_dismantle_req() as it's likely to
   never be allocated.
