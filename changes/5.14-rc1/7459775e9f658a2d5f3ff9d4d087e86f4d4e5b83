net: hns3: support dma_map_sg() for multi frags skb

Using the queue based tx buffer, it is also possible to allocate a
sgl buffer, and use skb_to_sgvec() to convert the skb to the sgvec
in order to support the dma_map_sg() to decreases the overhead of
IOMMU mapping and unmapping.

Firstly, it reduces the number of buffers. For example, a tcp skb
may have a 66-byte header and 3 fragments of 4328, 32768, and 28064
bytes. With this patch, dma_map_sg() will combine them into two
buffers, 66-bytes header and one 65160-bytes fragment by using IOMMU.

Secondly, it reduces the number of dma mapping and unmapping. All the
original 4 buffers are mapped only once rather than 4 times.

The throughput improves above 10% when running single thread of iperf
using TCP when IOMMU is in strict mode.
