dma-buf: rename and cleanup dma_resv_get_excl v3

When the comment needs to state explicitly that this
doesn't get a reference to the object then the function
is named rather badly.

Rename the function and use rcu_dereference_check(), this
way it can be used from both rcu as well as lock protected
critical sections.

v2: improve kerneldoc as suggested by Daniel
v3: use dma_resv_excl_fence as function name
