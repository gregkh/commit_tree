KVM: x86/mmu: Remove redundant root_hpa checks

The root_hpa checks below the top-level check in kvm_mmu_page_fault are
theoretically redundant since there is no longer a way for the root_hpa
to be reset during a page fault. The details of why are described in
commit ddce6208217c ("KVM: x86/mmu: Move root_hpa validity checks to top
of page fault handler")

__direct_map, kvm_tdp_mmu_map, and get_mmio_spte are all only reachable
through kvm_mmu_page_fault, therefore their root_hpa checks are
redundant.
