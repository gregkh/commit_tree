net/mlx5e: RX, Remove unnecessary check in RX CQE compression handling

There are two reasons for exiting mlx5e_decompress_cqes_cont():
1. The compression session is completed (cqd.left == 0).
2. The budget is exhausted (work_done == budget).

If after calling mlx5e_decompress_cqes_cont() we have cqd.left > 0,
it necessarily implies that budget is exhausted.

The first part of the complex condition is covered by the second,
hence we remove it here.
