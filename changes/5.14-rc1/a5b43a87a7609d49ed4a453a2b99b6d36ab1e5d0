arm64: entry: template the entry asm functions

Now that the majority of the exception triage logic has been converted
to C, the entry assembly functions all have a uniform structure.

Let's generate them all with an assembly macro to reduce the amount of
code and to ensure they all remain in sync if we make changes in future.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
