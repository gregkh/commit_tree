opp: Allow required-opps to be used for non genpd use cases

Don't limit required_opp_table to genpd only. One possible use case is
cpufreq based devfreq governor, which can use required-opps property to
derive devfreq from cpufreq.

Though the OPP core still doesn't support non-genpd required-opps in
_set_required_opps().
