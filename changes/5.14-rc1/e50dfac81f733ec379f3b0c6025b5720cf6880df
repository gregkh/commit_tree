ALSA: firewire-motu: cache event ticks in source packet header per data block

The devices in MOTU FireWire series put source packet header (SPH) into
each data block of tx packet for presentation time of event. The format
of timestamp is compliant to IEC 61883-1, with cycle and offset fields
without sec field of 32 bit cycle time.

This commit takes ALSA firewire-motu driver to cache the presentation
time as offset from cycle in which the packet is transferred.
