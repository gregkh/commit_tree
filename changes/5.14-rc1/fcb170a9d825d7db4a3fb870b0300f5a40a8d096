SUNRPC: Fix the batch tasks count wraparound.

The 'queue->nr' will wraparound from 0 to 255 when only current
priority queue has tasks. This maybe lead a deadlock same as commit
dfe1fe75e00e ("NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4_evict_inode()
and nfs4_opendata_get_inode()"):

Privileged delegreturn task is queued to privileged list because all
the slots are assigned. When non-privileged task complete and release
the slot, a non-privileged maybe picked out. It maybe allocate slot
failed when the session on draining.

If the 'queue->nr' has wraparound to 255, and no enough slot to
service it, then the privileged delegreturn will lost to wake up.

So we should avoid the wraparound on 'queue->nr'.
