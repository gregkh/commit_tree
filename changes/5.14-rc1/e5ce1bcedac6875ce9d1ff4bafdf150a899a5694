mxser: extract mxser_receive_chars_new

Extract the new handling of receive chars (using the MUST chip
enhancements) into a separate function. This eliminates the need for the
intr_old label and makes the code of mxser_receive_chars more compact.
In the next step, we will extract the old handling too.
