userfaultfd/selftests: use user mode only

Patch series "userfaultfd/selftests: A few cleanups", v2.

I wanted to cleanup userfaultfd.c fault handling for a long time.  If it's
not cleaned, when the new code grows the file it'll also grow the size
that needs to be cleaned...  This is my attempt to cleanup the userfaultfd
selftest on fault handling, to use an err() macro instead of either
fprintf() or perror() then another exit() call.

The huge cleanup is done in the last patch.  The first 4 patches are some
other standalone cleanups for the same file, so I put them together.

This patch (of 5):

Userfaultfd selftest does not need to handle kernel initiated fault.  Set
user mode so it can be run even if unprivileged_userfaultfd=0 (which is
the default).
