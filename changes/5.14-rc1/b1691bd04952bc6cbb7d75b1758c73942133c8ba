serial: 8250: Document SMSC Super I/O UART peculiarities

Contrary to what SMSC documentation says and unlike NS16C550A UARTs the
SMSC Super I/O IC claims compatibility with the SMSC UART implementation
does not support dividing the internal PLL clock by any divisor from 1
to 65535[1], with the exception of two magic divisors of 32769 and 32770
used respectively to select the high-speed data rates of 460800bps and
230400bps[2] if enabled on a port-by-port basis in with the Serial Port
Mode Register in the Device Configuration Space[3][4].

Instead empirical evidence indicates that the divisor, as stored in the
DLL and DLM register pair, has the range of 1 to 32767 only, and bit 7
of the DLM register (bit 15 of the divisor) effectively serves as a
selection bit for the prescaler from the base frequency of 7.3728MHz,
either 4 if the bit is 0, or 1 if the bit is 1 and high-speed operation
has been enabled with the Serial Port Mode Register.

So if high-speed operation has not been enabled, then say the values of
1 and 32769 (0x8001) written into the combined DLL and DLM register pair
both select the divisor of 1 and the baud rate of 115200bps.
