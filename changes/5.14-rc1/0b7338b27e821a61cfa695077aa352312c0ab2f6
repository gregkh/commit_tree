EDAC/igen6: Add Intel Tiger Lake SoC support

Tiger Lake SoC shares the same memory controller and In-Band ECC
(IBECC) IP with Elkhart Lake SoC. The main differences are that Tiger
Lake has two memory controllers each associated with one IBECC and
uses Machine Check for the memory error notification.

So add Tiger Lake compute die IDs, MCE decoding chain registration,
and memory slice decoding for Tiger Lake EDAC support.
