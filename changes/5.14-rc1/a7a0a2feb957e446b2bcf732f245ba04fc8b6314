ASoC: fsl_spdif: Fix unexpected interrupt after suspend

When system enter suspend, the machine driver suspend callback
function will be called, then the cpu driver trigger callback
(SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_SUSPEND) be called, it would disable the
interrupt.

But the machine driver suspend and cpu dai driver suspend order
maybe changed, the cpu dai driver's suspend callback is called before
machine driver's suppend callback, then the interrupt is not cleared
successfully in trigger callback.

So need to clear interrupts in cpu dai driver's suspend callback
to avoid such issue.
