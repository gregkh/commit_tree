ata: ahci_sunxi: Disable DIPM

DIPM is unsupported or broken on sunxi. Trying to enable the power
management policy med_power_with_dipm on an Allwinner A20 SoC based board
leads to immediate I/O errors and the attached SATA disk disappears from
the /dev filesystem. A reset (power cycle) is required to make the SATA
controller or disk work again. The A10 and A20 SoC data sheets and manuals
don't mention DIPM at all [1], so it's fair to assume that it's simply not
supported. But even if it was, it should be considered broken and best be
disabled in the ahci_sunxi driver.
