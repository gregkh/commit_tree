misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge

There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.
A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,
bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL.
Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's
ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by
alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do
here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.
This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply
return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.
