media: atmel: atmel-isc: create callback for GAM submodule product specific

The GAM submodule is a part of the atmel-isc pipeline, and stands for
Gamma Correction. It is used to apply the gamma curve to the incoming pixels.
Create a product specific callback for initializing the GAM submodule
of the pipeline.
For sama5d2 product, there is no special configuration at this moment,
thus this function is a noop.
