net: hsr: don't check sequence number if tag removal is offloaded

Don't check the sequence number when deciding when to update time_in in
the node table if tag removal is offloaded since the sequence number is
part of the tag. This fixes a problem where the times in the node table
wouldn't update when 0 appeared to be before or equal to seq_out when
tag removal was offloaded.
