dt-bindings: mmc: add no-mmc-hs400 flag

HS400 requires a data strobe line in addition to the usual MMC signal
lines. If a board design neglects to wire up this signal, HS400 mode is
not available, even if both the controller and the eMMC are claiming to
support this mode. Add a DT flag to allow boards to disable the HS400
support in this case.
