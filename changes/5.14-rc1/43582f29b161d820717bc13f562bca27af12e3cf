gpiolib: acpi: Introduce acpi_get_and_request_gpiod() helper

We need to be able to translate GPIO resources in an ACPI device's _CRS
into GPIO descriptor array. Those are represented in _CRS as a pathname
to a GPIO device plus the pin's index number: the acpi_get_gpiod()
function is perfect for that purpose.

As it's currently only used internally within the GPIO layer, provide and
export a wrapper function that additionally holds a reference to the GPIO
device.
