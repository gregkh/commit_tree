net/smc: avoid possible duplicate dmb unregistration

smc_lgr_cleanup() calls smcd_unregister_all_dmbs() as part of the link
group termination process. This is a leftover from the times when
smc_lgr_cleanup() scheduled a worker to actually free the link group.
Nowadays smc_lgr_cleanup() directly calls smc_lgr_free() without any
delay so an earlier dmb unregistration is no longer needed.
So remove smcd_unregister_all_dmbs() and the call to it.
