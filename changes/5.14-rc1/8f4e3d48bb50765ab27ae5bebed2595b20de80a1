mwifiex: re-fix for unaligned accesses

A patch from 2017 changed some accesses to DMA memory to use
get_unaligned_le32() and similar interfaces, to avoid problems
with doing unaligned accesson uncached memory.

However, the change in the mwifiex_pcie_alloc_sleep_cookie_buf()
function ended up changing the size of the access instead,
as it operates on a pointer to u8.

Change this function back to actually access the entire 32 bits.
Note that the pointer is aligned by definition because it came
from dma_alloc_coherent().
