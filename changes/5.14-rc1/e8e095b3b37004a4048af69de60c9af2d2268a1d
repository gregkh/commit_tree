octeontx2-af: cn10k: Bandwidth profiles config support

CN10K silicons supports hierarchial ingress packet ratelimiting.
There are 3 levels of profilers supported leaf, mid and top.
Ratelimiting is done after packet forwarding decision is taken
and a NIXLF's RQ is identified to DMA the packet. RQ's context
points to a leaf bandwidth profile which can be configured
to achieve desired ratelimit.

This patch adds logic for management of these bandwidth profiles
ie profile alloc, free, context update etc.
