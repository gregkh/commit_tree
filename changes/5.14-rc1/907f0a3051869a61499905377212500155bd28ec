ASoC: simple-card: Fill in driver name

alsa-ucm groups by driver name so fill that in as well. Otherwise the
presented information is redundant and doesn't reflect the used
driver. We can't just use 'asoc-simple-card' since the driver name is
restricted to 15 characters.

Before:

 # cat /proc/asound/cards
 0 [Devkit         ]: Librem_5_Devkit - Librem 5 Devkit
                      Librem 5 Devkit
After:

 0 [Devkit         ]: simple-card - Librem 5 Devkit
                      Librem 5 Devkit
