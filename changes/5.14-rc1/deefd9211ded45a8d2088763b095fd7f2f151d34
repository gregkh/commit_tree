staging: rtl8188eu: fix usb_submit_urb error handling

usb_read_port prepares a bulk in urb and calls usb_submit_urb to pass the
usb to the usb core. It seems wrong that usb_read_port returns success to
its caller if usb_submit_urb failed with -EPERM.

According to drivers/usb/core/urb.c, usb_submit_urb returns -EPERM when
an urb is resubmitted after being cancelled by usb_kill_urb etc.

The only caller who checks the return value of usb_read_port is
rtw_hal_inirp_init. This function submits the bulk in urbs for the first
time after the netdevice is opened. We'll not receive -EPERM from
usb_submit_urb in this case. The urbs are resubmitted by
read_port_complete, which does not check for errors from usb_read_port.

This driver may kill pending bulk in urbs when the netdevice is closed when
the driver is unloaded or the system goes to sleep. I don't think that this
will interrupt an ongoing netdev open.
