tick/broadcast: Prefer per-cpu oneshot wakeup timers to broadcast

Some SoCs have two per-cpu timer implementations where the timer with the
higher rating stops in deep idle (i.e. suffers from CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP)
but is otherwise preferable to the timer with the lower rating. In such a
design, selecting the higher rated devices relies on a global broadcast
timer and IPIs to wake up from deep idle states.

To avoid the reliance on a global broadcast timer and also to reduce the
overhead associated with the IPI wakeups, extend
tick_install_broadcast_device() to manage per-cpu wakeup timers separately
from the broadcast device.

For now, these timers remain unused.
