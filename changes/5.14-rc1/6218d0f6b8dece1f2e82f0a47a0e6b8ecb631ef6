x86/syscalls: Switch to generic syscalltbl.sh

Many architectures duplicate similar shell scripts.

Convert x86 and UML to use scripts/syscalltbl.sh. The generic script
generates seperate headers for x86/64 and x86/x32 syscalls, while the x86
specific script coalesced them into one. Adjust the code accordingly.
