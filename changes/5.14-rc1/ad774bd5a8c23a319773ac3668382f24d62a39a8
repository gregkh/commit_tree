EDAC/igen6: Add Intel Alder Lake SoC support

Alder Lake SoC shares the same memory controller and In-Band ECC
(IBECC) IP with Tiger Lake SoC. Like Tiger Lake, it also has two
memory controllers each associated one IBECC instance. The minor
differences include the MMIO offset of each memory controller and
the type of memory error address logged in the IBECC.

So add Alder Lake compute die IDs, adjust the MMIO offset for each
memory controller and handle the type of memory error address logged
in the IBECC for Alder Lake EDAC support.
