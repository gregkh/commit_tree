dt-binding: memory: pl353-smc: Drop unsupported nodes from the example

These nodes are given as examples and are not described nor used
anywhere else. There is also no hardware of my knowledge compatible with
these yet. If we want to be backward compatible, then we should avoid
partially describing nodes and their content while there are no users.
Plus, the examples are wrong (the addresses should be updated) so
let's drop them before converting this file to yaml (only the NAND node,
which will be fixed in the example and described somewhere else is
kept).
