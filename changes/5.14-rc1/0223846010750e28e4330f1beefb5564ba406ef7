rcu: Remove obsolete rcu_read_unlock() deadlock commentary

The deferred quiescent states resulting from the consolidation of RCU-bh
and RCU-sched into RCU means that rcu_read_unlock() will no longer attempt
to acquire scheduler locks if interrupts were disabled across that call
to rcu_read_unlock().  The cautions in the rcu_read_unlock() header
comment are therefore obsolete.  This commit therefore removes them.
