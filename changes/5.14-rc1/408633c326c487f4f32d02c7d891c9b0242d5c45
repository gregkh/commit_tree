KVM: selftests: Use "standard" min virtual address for CPUID test alloc

Use KVM_UTIL_MIN_ADDR as the minimum for x86-64's CPUID array.  The
system page size was likely used as the minimum because _something_ had
to be provided.  Increasing the min from 0x1000 to 0x2000 should have no
meaningful impact on the test, and will allow changing vm_vaddr_alloc()
to use KVM_UTIL_MIN_VADDR as the default.
