sit: allow redirecting ip6ip, ipip and mplsip packets to eth devices

Even though sit transports L3 data (IPv6, IPv4 or MPLS) packets, it
needs to reset the mac_header pointer, so that other parts of the stack
don't mistakenly access the outer header after the packet has been
decapsulated. There are two rx handlers to modify: ipip6_rcv() for the
ip6ip mode and sit_tunnel_rcv() which is used to re-implement the ipip
and mplsip modes of ipip.ko.

This allows to push an Ethernet header to sit packets and redirect
them to an Ethernet device:

  $ tc filter add dev sit0 ingress matchall          \
      action vlan push_eth dst_mac 00:00:5e:00:53:01 \
                           src_mac 00:00:5e:00:53:00 \
      action mirred egress redirect dev eth0

Without this patch, push_eth refuses to add an ethernet header because
the skb appears to already have a MAC header.
