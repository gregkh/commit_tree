riscv: mm: add _PAGE_LEAF macro

In riscv, a page table entry is leaf when any bit of read, write,
or execute bit is set. So add a macro:_PAGE_LEAF instead of
(_PAGE_READ | _PAGE_WRITE | _PAGE_EXEC), which is frequently used
to determine if it is a leaf page. This make code easier to read,
without any functional change.
