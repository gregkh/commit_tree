powerpc/pseries/vas: Implement getting capabilities from hypervisor

The hypervisor provides VAS capabilities for GZIP default and QoS
features. These capabilities gives information for the specific
features such as total number of credits available in LPAR,
maximum credits allowed per window, maximum credits allowed in
LPAR, whether usermode copy/paste is supported, and etc.

This patch adds the following:
- Retrieve all features that are provided by hypervisor using
  H_QUERY_VAS_CAPABILITIES hcall with 0 as feature type.
- Retrieve capabilities for the specific feature using the same
  hcall and the feature type (1 for QoS and 2 for default type).
