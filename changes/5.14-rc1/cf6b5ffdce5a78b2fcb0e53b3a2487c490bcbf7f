netfilter: nft_exthdr: Fix for unsafe packet data read

While iterating through an SCTP packet's chunks, skb_header_pointer() is
called for the minimum expected chunk header size. If (that part of) the
skbuff is non-linear, the following memcpy() may read data past
temporary buffer '_sch'. Use skb_copy_bits() instead which does the
right thing in this situation.
