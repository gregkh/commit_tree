arm64: entry: split SDEI entry

We'd like to keep all the entry sequencing in entry-common.c, as this
will allow us to ensure this is consistent, and free from any unsound
instrumentation.

Currently __sdei_handler() performs the NMI entry/exit sequences in
sdei.c. Let's split the low-level entry sequence from the event
handling, moving the former to entry-common.c and keeping the latter in
sdei.c. The event handling function is renamed to do_sdei_event(),
matching the do_${FOO}() pattern used for other exception handlers.
