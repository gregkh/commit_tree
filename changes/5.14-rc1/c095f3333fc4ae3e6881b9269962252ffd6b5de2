btrfs: introduce btrfs_lookup_first_ordered_range()

Although we already have btrfs_lookup_first_ordered_extent() and
btrfs_lookup_ordered_extent(), they all have their own limitations:

- btrfs_lookup_ordered_extent() can't do extra range check

  It's only designed to lookup any ordered extent before certain bytenr.

- btrfs_lookup_first_ordered_extent() may not return the first ordered
  extent in the range

  It doesn't ensure the first ordered extent is returned.
  The existing callers are only interested in exhausting all ordered
  extents in a range, the order is not important.

For incoming btrfs_invalidatepage() refactoring, we need a way to
properly iterate all ordered extents in their bytenr order of a range.

So this patch will introduce a new function,
btrfs_lookup_first_ordered_range(), to do ordered extent with bytenr
order awareness and extra range check.
