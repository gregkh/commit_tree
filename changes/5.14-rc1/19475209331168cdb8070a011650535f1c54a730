tty: drop tty_ldisc_ops::refcount

The refcount is checked only in tty_unregister_ldisc and EBUSY returned
if it is nonzero. But none of the tty_unregister_ldisc callers act
anyhow if this (or any other) error is returned. So remove
tty_ldisc_ops::refcount completely and make tty_unregister_ldisc return
'void' in the next patches. That means we assume tty_unregister_ldisc is
not called while the ldisc might be in use. That relies on
try_module_get in get_ldops and module_put in put_ldops.
