virtio_ring: secure handling of mapping errors

We should not depend on the DMA address, length and flag of descriptor
table since they could be wrote with arbitrary value by the device. So
this patch switches to use the stored one in desc_extra.

Note that the indirect descriptors are fine since they are read-only
streaming mappings.
