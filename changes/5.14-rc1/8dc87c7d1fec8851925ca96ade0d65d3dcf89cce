mm: memcontrol: fix page charging in page replacement

Patch series "memcontrol code cleanup and simplification", v3.

This patch (of 8):

The pages aren't accounted at the root level, so do not charge the page to
the root memcg in page replacement.  Although we do not display the value
(mem_cgroup_usage) so there shouldn't be any actual problem, but there is
a WARN_ON_ONCE in the page_counter_cancel().  Who knows if it will
trigger?  So it is better to fix it.
