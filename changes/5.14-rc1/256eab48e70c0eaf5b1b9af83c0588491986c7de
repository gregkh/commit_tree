selftests/bpf: Stop using static variables for passing data to/from user-space

In preparation of skipping emitting static variables in BPF skeletons, switch
all current selftests uses of static variables to pass data between BPF and
user-space to use global variables.

All non-read-only `static volatile` variables become just plain global
variables by dropping `static volatile` part.

Read-only `static volatile const` variables, though, still require `volatile`
modifier, otherwise compiler will ignore whatever values are set from
user-space.

Few static linker tests are using name-conflicting static variables to
validate that static linker still properly handles static variables and
doesn't trip up on name conflicts.
