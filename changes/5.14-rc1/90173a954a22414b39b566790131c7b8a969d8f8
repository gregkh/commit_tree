arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add CPU opps

Add the operating points capabilities of the kryo CPUs, that can be
used for frequency scaling. There are two differents operating point
tables, one for the big cluster and one for the LITTLE cluster.

This frequency scaling support can then be used as a passive cooling
device (cpufreq cooling device).

Only add nominal fmax for now, since there is no dynamic control of
VDD APC (s11..) which is statically set at its nominal value.
