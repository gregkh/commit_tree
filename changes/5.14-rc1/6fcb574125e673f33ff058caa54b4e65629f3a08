powerpc: Kconfig: disable CONFIG_COMPAT for clang < 12

Until clang-12, clang would attempt to assemble 32b powerpc assembler in
64b emulation mode when using a 64b target triple with -m32, leading to
errors during the build of the compat VDSO. Simply disable all of
CONFIG_COMPAT; users should upgrade to the latest release of clang for
proper support.
