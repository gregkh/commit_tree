powerpc/32: use set_memory_attr()

Use set_memory_attr() instead of the PPC32 specific change_page_attr()

change_page_attr() was checking that the address was not mapped by
blocks and was handling highmem, but that's unneeded because the
affected pages can't be in highmem and block mapping verification
is already done by the callers.
