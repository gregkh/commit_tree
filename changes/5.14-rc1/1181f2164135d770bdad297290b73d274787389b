backlight: lm3630a: Convert to atomic PWM API and check for errors

The practical upside here is that this only needs a single API call to
program the hardware which (depending on the underlaying hardware) can
be more effective and prevents glitches.

Up to now the return value of the pwm functions was ignored. Fix this
and propagate the error to the caller.
