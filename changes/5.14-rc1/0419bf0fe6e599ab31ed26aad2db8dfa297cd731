ipac: tpci200: fix kernel-doc syntax and remove filename from file header

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
The header for drivers/ipack/carriers/tpci200 follows this syntax, but the
content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.

This line was probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but is parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warning from kernel-doc.

For e.g., running scripts/kernel-doc -none on
drivers/ipack/carriers/tpci200.c emits:
warning: This comment starts with '/**', but isn't a kernel-doc comment. Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst
 * tpci200.c

Provide a simple fix by replacing this occurrence with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.

Also remove the redundant file name from the comment headers.
