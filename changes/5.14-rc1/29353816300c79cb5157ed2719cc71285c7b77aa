watchdog: keembay: Update WDT pre-timeout during the initialization

The pretimeout register has a default reset value. Hence
when a smaller WDT timeout is set which would be lesser than the
default pretimeout, the system behaves abnormally, starts
triggering the pretimeout interrupt even when the WDT is
not enabled, most of the times leading to system crash.
Hence an update in the pre-timeout is also required for the
default timeout that is being configured.
