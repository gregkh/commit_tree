KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save host FSCR in the P7/8 path

Similar to commit 25edcc50d76c ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Save and restore
FSCR in the P9 path"), ensure the P7/8 path saves and restores the host
FSCR. The logic explained in that patch actually applies there to the
old path well: a context switch can be made before kvmppc_vcpu_run_hv
restores the host FSCR and returns.

Now both the p9 and the p7/8 paths now save and restore their FSCR, it
no longer needs to be restored at the end of kvmppc_vcpu_run_hv
