kbuild: mkcompile_h: consider timestamp if KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP is set

To avoid unnecessary recompilations, mkcompile_h does not regenerate
compile.h if just the timestamp changed.
Though, if KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP is set, an explicit timestamp for the
build was requested, in which case we should not ignore it.

If a user follows the documentation for reproducible builds [1] and
defines KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP as the git commit timestamp, a clean
build will have the correct timestamp. A subsequent cherry-pick (or
amend) changes the commit timestamp and if an incremental build is done
with a different KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP now, that new value is not taken
into consideration. But it should for reproducibility.

Hence, whenever KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP is explicitly set, do not ignore
UTS_VERSION when making a decision about whether the regenerated version
of compile.h should be moved into place.
