dt-bindings: iio: bma255: Allow multiple interrupts

BMA253 has two interrupt pins (INT1 and INT2) that can be configured
independently. At the moment the bmc150-accel driver does not make use
of them but it might be able to in the future, so it's useful to already
specify all available interrupts in the device tree.

Set maxItems: 2 for interrupts to allow specifying a second one.
This is necessary as preparation to move the bosch,bma254 compatible
from bosch,bma180.yaml to bosch,bma255.yaml since bma180 allows two
interrupts, but BMA254 is better supported by the bmc150-accel driver.
