bpf, sched: Remove unneeded rcu_read_lock() around BPF program invocation

The rcu_read_lock() call in cls_bpf and act_bpf are redundant: on the TX
side, there's already a call to rcu_read_lock_bh() in __dev_queue_xmit(),
and on RX there's a covering rcu_read_lock() in
netif_receive_skb{,_list}_internal().

With the previous patches we also amended the lockdep checks in the map
code to not require any particular RCU flavour, so we can just get rid of
the rcu_read_lock()s.
