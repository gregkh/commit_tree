mm, memcg: introduce mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled()

Introduce a new mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled() helper, similar to
mem_cgroup_disabled(), to check whether the kernel memory accounting
is off. A user could disable it using a boot option to eliminate
some associated costs.

The helper can be used outside of memcontrol.c to dynamically disable
the kmem-related code. The returned value is stable after the kernel
initialization is finished.
