dmaengine: Add device_terminate_all callback

Split out the terminate_all command from device_control to a dma_device
callback. In order to preserve backward capability, still rely on
device_control if no such callback has been implemented.

Eventually, this will allow to create a generic dma_slave_caps callback.
