cpufreq: remove CPUFREQ_UPDATE_POLICY_CPU notifications

CPUFREQ_UPDATE_POLICY_CPU notifications were used only from cpufreq-stats which
doesn't use it anymore. Remove them.

This also decrements values of other notification macros defined after
CPUFREQ_UPDATE_POLICY_CPU by 1 to remove gaps. Hopefully all users are using
macro's instead of direct numbers and so they wouldn't break as macro values are
changed now.
