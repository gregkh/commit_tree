ALSA: hdspm - Constrain periods to 2 on older cards

RME RayDAT and AIO use a fixed buffer size of 16384 samples. With period
sizes of 32-4096, this translates to 4-512 periods.

The older RME cards have a variable buffer size but require exactly two
periods.

This patch enforces nperiods=2 on those cards.
