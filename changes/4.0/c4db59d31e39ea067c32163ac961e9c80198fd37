fs: don't reassign dirty inodes to default_backing_dev_info

If we have dirty inodes we need to call the filesystem for it, even if the
device has been removed and the filesystem will error out early.  The
current code does that by reassining all dirty inodes to the default
backing_dev_info when a bdi is unlinked, but that's pretty pointless given
that the bdi must always outlive the super block.

Instead of stopping writeback at unregister time and moving inodes to the
default bdi just keep the current bdi alive until it is destroyed.  The
containing objects of the bdi ensure this doesn't happen until all
writeback has finished by erroring out.
