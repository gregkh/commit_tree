toshiba_acpi: Move sysfs function and struct declarations further down

Commit 93f8c16d635e ("toshiba_acpi: Support new keyboard backlight
type") moved all the sysfs structs and function declarations further
up in order to make use of sysfs_update_group, however,
commit 805469053ba9 ("toshiba_acpi: Add keyboard backlight mode
change event") made use of that function unnecesary.

This patch moves all the sysfs structs and function declarations
further down, making the file shorther in lines and more readable.
