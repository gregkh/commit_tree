[media] media: ti-vpe: Use mem-to-mem ioctl helpers

1: Simplify the vpe mem-to-mem driver by using the m2m ioctl
   and vb2 helpers.
2: Align and arranged the v4l2_ioctl_ops.
3: Fixes a typo.
4: Use of_match_ptr() instead of explicitly defining the macro
   to NULL in case CONFIG_OF is not defined.
