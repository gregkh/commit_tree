PCI: versatile: Update for list_for_each_entry() API change

In Linux 4.0-rc1 ARM Versatile PCI build fails to build due to what
appears to be an API update.  This patch is a very simple correction,
merely posted as a heads-up to the maintainers.  Hopefully a better
fix can be forwarded to Linus.

[ arnd: the patch actually looks correct, so let's take this version ]
