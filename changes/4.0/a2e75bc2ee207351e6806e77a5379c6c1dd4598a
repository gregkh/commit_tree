xenbus: Add proper handling of XS_ERROR from Xenbus for transactions.

If Xenstore sends back a XS_ERROR for TRANSACTION_END, the driver BUGs
because it cannot find the matching transaction in the list.  For
TRANSACTION_START, it leaks memory.

Check the message as returned from xenbus_dev_request_and_reply(), and
clean up for TRANSACTION_START or discard the error for
TRANSACTION_END.
