md: move GET_BITMAP_FILE ioctl out from mddev_lock.

It makes more sense to report bitmap_info->file, rather than
bitmap->file (the later is only available once the array is
active).

With that change, use mddev->lock to protect bitmap_info being
set to NULL, and we can call get_bitmap_file() without taking
the mutex.
