irqchip: gicv3-its: Iterate over PCI aliases to generate ITS configuration

The current PCI/MSI support in the GICv3 ITS doesn't really deal
with systems where different PCI devices end-up using the same
RequesterID (as it would be the case with non-transparent bridges,
for example). It is likely that none of these devices would
actually generate any interrupt, as the ITS is programmed with
the device's own ID, and not that of the bridge.

A solution to this is to iterate over the PCI hierarchy to
discover what the device aliases too. We also use this
to discover the upper bound of the number of MSIs that this
sub-hierarchy can generate.

With this in place, PCI aliases can be supported.
