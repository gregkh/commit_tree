mmc: pwrseq: Initial support for the simple MMC power sequence provider

To add the core part for the MMC power sequence, let's start by adding
initial support for the simple MMC power sequence provider.

In this initial step, the MMC power sequence node are fetched and the
compatible string for the simple MMC power sequence provider are
verified.

At this point we don't parse the node for any properties, but instead
that will be handled from following patches. Since there are no
properties supported yet, let's just implement the ->alloc() and the
->free() callbacks.
