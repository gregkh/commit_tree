perf: Fix event->ctx locking

There have been a few reported issues wrt. the lack of locking around
changing event->ctx. This patch tries to address those.

It avoids the whole rwsem thing; and while it appears to work, please
give it some thought in review.

What I did fail at is sensible runtime checks on the use of
event->ctx, the RCU use makes it very hard.
