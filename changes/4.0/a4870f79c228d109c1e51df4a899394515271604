vxlan: Wrong type passed to %pIS

src_ip is a pointer to a union vxlan_addr, one member of which is a
struct sockaddr. Passing a pointer to src_ip is wrong; one should pass
the value of src_ip itself. Since %pIS formally expects something of
type struct sockaddr*, let's pass a pointer to the appropriate union
member, though this of course doesn't change the generated code.
