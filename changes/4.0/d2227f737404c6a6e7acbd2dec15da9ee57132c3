mpt2sas: map log_info value 0x0x32010081 to DID_RESET

For any SCSI command, if the driver receives IOC status =
SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED and log info = 0x32010081 then that command will be
completed with DID_RESET host status.

The definition of this log info value is "Virtual IO has failed and has
to be retried".

Firmware will provide this log info value with IOC Status
"SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED", whenever a drive (with is a part of a volume)
is pulled and pushed back within some minimal delay.  With this log info
value, firmware informs the driver to retry the failed IO command
infinite times, so to provide some time for the firmware to discover
the reinserted drive successfully instated of just retrying failed
command for five times( doesn't giving enough time for firmware to
complete the drive discovery) and failing the IO permanently even
though drive came back successfully.
