ASoC: fsl_ssi: Fix the incorrect limitation of the bit clock rate

According to i.MX Reference Manual, the bit-clock frequency generated
by SSI must be never greater than 1/5 of the peripheral clock frequency.

This peripheral clock, however, is not baudclk but the IPG clock (i.e.
ssi_private->clk in the fsl_ssi driver).

So this patch just simply fixes the incorrect limitation applied to
the bit clock (baudclk) rate.
