cfg80211: remove enum station_info_flags

This is really just duplicating the list of information that's
already available in the nl80211 attribute, so remove the list.
Two small changes are needed:
 * remove STATION_INFO_ASSOC_REQ_IES complete, but the length
   (assoc_req_ies_len) can be used instead
 * add NL80211_STA_INFO_RX_DROP_MISC which exists internally
   but not in nl80211 yet

This gets rid of the duplicate maintenance of the two lists.
