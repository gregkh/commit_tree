Input: psmouse - disable changing resolution/rate/scale for FocalTech

These PS/2 commands make some touchpads stop responding, so this commit
adds some dummy functions to replace the generic implementation. Because
scale changes were not encapsulated in a method of struct psmouse yet, this
commit adds a method set_scale to psmouse.
