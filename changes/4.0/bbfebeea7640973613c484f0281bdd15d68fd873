[media] em28xx: fix em28xx-input removal

Removing the em28xx-rc module results in the following lockdep splat,
which is caused by trying to call cancel_delayed_work_sync() on an
uninitialised delayed work.  Fix this by ensuring we always initialise
the work.

INFO: trying to register non-static key.
the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
turning off the locking correctness validator.
