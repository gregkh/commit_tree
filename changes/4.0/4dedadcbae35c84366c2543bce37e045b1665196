ixgbe: Cleanup probe to remove redundant attempt to ID PHY

We always identify the PHY in our reset_hw path anyway so there is
no need to do it in get_invariants().  The reason I even noticed this
is that for new hardware (X550em) we don't assign some methods until
later in probe and calling phy.ops.read_reg could lead to a panic.
