i2c: ACPI: Pick the first address if device has multiple

ACPI specification allows I2C devices with multiple addresses. The current
implementation goes over all addresses and assigns the last one to the
device. This is typically not the primary address of the device.

Instead of doing that we assign the first address to the device and then
let the driver handle rest of the addresses as it wishes.
