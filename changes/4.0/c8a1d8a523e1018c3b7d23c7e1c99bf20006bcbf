rtc: rtc-ab-b5ze-s3: add sub-minute alarm support

Abracon AB-RTCMC-32.768kHz-B5ZE-S3 alarm is only accurate to the minute.
For that reason, UIE mode is currently not supported by the driver.  But
the device provides a watchdog timer which can be coupled with the alarm
mechanism to extend support and provide sub-minute alarm capability.

This patch implements that extension.  More precisely, it makes use of the
watchdog timer for alarms which are less that four minutes in the future
(with second accuracy) and use standard alarm mechanism for other alarms
(with minute accuracy).
