rhashtable: key_hashfn() must return full hash value

The value computed by key_hashfn() is used by rhashtable_lookup_compare()
to traverse both tables during a resize. key_hashfn() must therefore
return the hash value without the buckets mask applied so it can be
masked to the size of each individual table.
