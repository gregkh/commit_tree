hpsa: do not queue commands internally in driver

By not doing maintaining a list of queued commands, we can eliminate some spin
locking in the main i/o path and gain significant improvement in IOPS.  Remove
the queuing code and the code that calls it; remove now-unused interrupt code;
remove DIRECT_LOOKUP_BIT.

Now that the passthru commands share the same command pool as
the main i/o path, and the total size of the pool is less than
or equal to the number of commands that will fit in the hardware
fifo, there is no need to check to see if we are exceeding the
hardware fifo's depth.
