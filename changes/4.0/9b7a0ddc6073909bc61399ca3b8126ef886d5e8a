brcmfmac: pass DEAUTH/DISASSOC reason code to user-space

The driver always called cfg80211_disconnected() with reason parameter
set to zero, ie. unknown. However, firmware does provide a valid
802.11 reason code in DEAUTH and DISASSOC event message to the driver.
This patch passes the reason code to cfg80211_disconnected().
