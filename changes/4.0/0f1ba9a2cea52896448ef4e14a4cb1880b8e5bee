softirq/preempt: Add missing current->preempt_disable_ip update

While debugging some "sleeping function called from invalid context" bug I
realized that the debugging message "Preemption disabled at:" pointed to
an incorrect function.

In particular if the last function/action that disabled preemption was
spin_lock_bh() then current->preempt_disable_ip won't be updated.

The reason for this is that __local_bh_disable_ip() will increase
preempt_count manually instead of calling preempt_count_add(), which
would handle the update correctly.

It look like the manual handling was done to work around some lockdep issue.

So add the missing update of current->preempt_disable_ip to
__local_bh_disable_ip() as well.
