drm/exynos: fix DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING usage

The Exynos DRM driver doesn't follow the correct API when dealing with
dma_{alloc, mmap, free}_attrs functions and the
DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING attribute.

When a IOMMU is not available and the DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING is
used, the driver should use the pointer returned by dma_alloc_attr() as
a cookie.

The Exynos DRM driver directly uses the non-requested virtual kernel
address returned by the DMA mapping subsystem. This just works now
because the non-IOMMU codepath doesn't obey DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING
but we need to fix it before fixing the DMA layer.
