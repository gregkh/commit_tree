NVMe: Register management handle under nvme class

This creates a new class type for nvme devices to register their
management character devices with. This is so we do not rely on miscdev
to provide enough minors for as many nvme devices some people plan to
use. The previous limit was approximately 60 NVMe controllers, depending
on the platform and kernel. Now the limit is 1M, which ought to be enough
for anybody.

Since we have a new device class, it makes sense to attach the block
devices under this as well, so part of this patch moves the management
handle initialization prior to the namespaces discovery.
