arm64: KVM: Do not use pgd_index to index stage-2 pgd

The kernel's pgd_index macro is designed to index a normal, page
sized array. KVM is a bit diffferent, as we can use concatenated
pages to have a bigger address space (for example 40bit IPA with
4kB pages gives us an 8kB PGD.

In the above case, the use of pgd_index will always return an index
inside the first 4kB, which makes a guest that has memory above
0x8000000000 rather unhappy, as it spins forever in a page fault,
whist the host happilly corrupts the lower pgd.

The obvious fix is to get our own kvm_pgd_index that does the right
thing(tm).

Tested on X-Gene with a hacked kvmtool that put memory at a stupidly
high address.
