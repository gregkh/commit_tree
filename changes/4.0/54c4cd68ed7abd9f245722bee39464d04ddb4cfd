drm/ttm: device address space != CPU address space

We need to store device offsets in 64 bit as the device
address space may be larger than the CPU's.

Fixes GPU init failures on radeons with 4GB or more of
vram on 32 bit kernels.  We put vram at the start of the
GPU's address space so the gart aperture starts at 4 GB
causing all GPU addresses in the gart aperture to get
truncated.
