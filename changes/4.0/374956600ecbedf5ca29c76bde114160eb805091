iio: buffer: Drop get_length callback

We already do have the length field in the struct iio_buffer which is
expected to be in sync with the current size of the buffer. And currently
all implementations of the get_length callback either return this field or a
constant number.

This patch removes the get_length callback and replaces all occurrences in
the IIO core with directly accessing the length field of the buffer.
