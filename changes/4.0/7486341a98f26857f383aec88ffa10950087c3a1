x86/platform, acpi: Bypass legacy PIC and PIT in ACPI hardware reduced mode

On a platform in ACPI Hardware-reduced mode, the legacy PIC and
PIT may not be initialized even though they may be present in
silicon. Touching these legacy components causes unexpected
results on the system.

On the Bay Trail-T(ASUS-T100) platform, touching these legacy
components blocks platform hardware low idle power state(S0ix)
during system suspend. So we should bypass them in ACPI hardware
reduced mode.
