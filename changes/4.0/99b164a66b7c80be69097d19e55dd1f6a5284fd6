Revert "ARM: imx: add FEC sleep mode callback function"

i.MX platform maintainer Shawn Guo is not happy with the such commit as
explained below [1]:

"The GPR difference between SoCs can be encoded in device tree as well.
It's pointless to repeat the same code pattern for every single
platform, that need to set up GPR bits for enabling magic packet wake
up, while the only difference is the register and bit offset.

The platform code will become quite messy and unmaintainable if every
device driver dump their GPR register setup code into platform.

Sorry, but it's NACK from me."

This reverts commit 456062b3ec6f5b9 ("ARM: imx: add FEC sleep mode callback
function").
