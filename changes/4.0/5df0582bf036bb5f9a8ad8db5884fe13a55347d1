drm/i915/vlv: remove wait for previous GFX clk disable request

Looks like it was introduced in:

    drm/i915: vlv: factor out vlv_force_gfx_clock and check for pending force-of

but I'm not sure why.  It has caused problems for us in the past (see
85250ddff7a6 "drm/i915/chv: Remove Wait for a previous gfx force-off"
and 8d4eee9cd7a1 "drm/i915: vlv: increase timeout when forcing on the
GFX clock") and doesn't seem to be required, so let's just drop it.
