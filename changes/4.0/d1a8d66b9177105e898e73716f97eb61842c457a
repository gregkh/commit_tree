efi/libstub: Call get_memory_map() to obtain map and desc sizes

This fixes two minor issues in the implementation of get_memory_map():
- Currently, it assumes that sizeof(efi_memory_desc_t) == desc_size,
  which is usually true, but not mandated by the spec. (This was added
  intentionally to allow future additions to the definition of
  efi_memory_desc_t). The way the loop is implemented currently, the
  added slack space may be insufficient if desc_size is larger, which in
  some corner cases could result in the loop never terminating.
- It allocates 32 efi_memory_desc_t entries first (again, using the size
  of the struct instead of desc_size), and frees and reallocates if it
  turns out to be insufficient. Few implementations of UEFI have such small
  memory maps, which results in a unnecessary allocate/free pair on each
  invocation.

Fix this by calling the get_memory_map() boot service first with a '0'
input value for map size to retrieve the map size and desc size from the
firmware and only then perform the allocation, using desc_size rather
than sizeof(efi_memory_desc_t).
