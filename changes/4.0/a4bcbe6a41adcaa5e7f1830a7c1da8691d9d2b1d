powerpc: Remove old compile time disabled syscall tracing code

We have code to do syscall tracing which is disabled at compile time by
default. It's not been touched since the dawn of time (ie. v2.6.12).

There are now better ways to do syscall tracing, ie. using the
raw_syscall, or syscall tracepoints.

For the specific case of tracing syscalls at boot on a system that
doesn't get to userspace, you can boot with:

  trace_event=syscalls tp_printk=on

Which will trace syscalls from boot, and echo all output to the console.
