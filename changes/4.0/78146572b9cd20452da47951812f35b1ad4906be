netfilter: Zero the tuple in nfnl_cthelper_parse_tuple()

nfnl_cthelper_parse_tuple() is called from nfnl_cthelper_new(),
nfnl_cthelper_get() and nfnl_cthelper_del().  In each case they pass
a pointer to an nf_conntrack_tuple data structure local variable:

    struct nf_conntrack_tuple tuple;
    ...
    ret = nfnl_cthelper_parse_tuple(&tuple, tb[NFCTH_TUPLE]);

The problem is that this local variable is not initialized, and
nfnl_cthelper_parse_tuple() only initializes two fields: src.l3num and
dst.protonum.  This leaves all other fields with undefined values
based on whatever is on the stack:

    tuple->src.l3num = ntohs(nla_get_be16(tb[NFCTH_TUPLE_L3PROTONUM]));
    tuple->dst.protonum = nla_get_u8(tb[NFCTH_TUPLE_L4PROTONUM]);

The symptom observed was that when the rpc and tns helpers were added
then traffic to port 1536 was being sent to user-space.
