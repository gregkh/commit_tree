debugfs: leave freeing a symlink body until inode eviction

As it is, we have debugfs_remove() racing with symlink traversals.
Supply ->evict_inode() and do freeing there - inode will remain
pinned until we are done with the symlink body.

And rip the idiocy with checking if dentry is positive right after
we'd verified debugfs_positive(), which is a stronger check...
