net-timestamp: no-payload option

Add timestamping option SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_TSONLY. For transmit
timestamps, this loops timestamps on top of empty packets.

Doing so reduces the pressure on SO_RCVBUF. Payload inspection and
cmsg reception (aside from timestamps) are no longer possible. This
works together with a follow on patch that allows administrators to
only allow tx timestamping if it does not loop payload or metadata.
