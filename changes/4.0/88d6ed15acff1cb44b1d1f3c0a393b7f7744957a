rhashtable: Convert bucket iterators to take table and index

This patch is in preparation to introduce per bucket spinlocks. It
extends all iterator macros to take the bucket table and bucket
index. It also introduces a new rht_dereference_bucket() to
handle protected accesses to buckets.

It introduces a barrier() to the RCU iterators to the prevent
the compiler from caching the first element.

The lockdep verifier is introduced as stub which always succeeds
and properly implement in the next patch when the locks are
introduced.
