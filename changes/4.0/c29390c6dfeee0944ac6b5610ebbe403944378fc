xps: must clear sender_cpu before forwarding

John reported that my previous commit added a regression
on his router.

This is because sender_cpu & napi_id share a common location,
so get_xps_queue() can see garbage and perform an out of bound access.

We need to make sure sender_cpu is cleared before doing the transmit,
otherwise any NIC busy poll enabled (skb_mark_napi_id()) can trigger
this bug.
