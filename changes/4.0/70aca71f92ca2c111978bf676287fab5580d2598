n_tty: Fix unordered accesses to lockless read buffer

Add commit_head buffer index, which the producer-side publishes
after input processing in non-canon mode. This ensures the consumer-side
observes correctly-ordered writes in non-canonical mode (ie., the buffer
data is written before the buffer index is advanced). Fix consumer-side
uses of read_cnt() to use commit_head instead.

Add required memory barriers to the tail index to guarantee
the consumer-side has completed the loads before the producer-side
begins writing new data. Open-code the producer-side receive_room()
into the i/o loop.

Remove no-longer-referenced receive_room().
