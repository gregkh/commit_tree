drm/i915: Use true PPGTT in Gen8+ when execlists are enabled

In Gen8+, full ppgtt needs execlist, otherwise the ctx switch can hang.

Also remove the current restriction, a user should be able to explicitly set
ppgtt=2.

Note, this patch considers that execlist support has been enabled by
default on Gen8.

v2: Remove non-default restriction and clarify commit message (Daniel)
