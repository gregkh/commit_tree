f2fs: trigger correct checkpoint during umount

This patch fixes to trigger checkpoint with umount flag when kill_sb was called.
In kill_sb, f2fs_sync_fs was finally called, but at this time, f2fs can't do
checkpoint with CP_UMOUNT.
After then, f2fs_put_super is not doing checkpoint, since it is not dirty.

So, this patch adds a flag to indicate f2fs_sync_fs is called during umount.
