ARM: davinci: davinci_cfg_reg cannot be init

davinci_cfg_reg gets called from a lot of locations that
might get called after the init section has been discarded,
so the function itself must not be marked __init either.

The kernel build currently warns about this with lots of
messages like:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x24c): Section mismatch in reference from the function dm365evm_mmc_configure() to the function .init.text:davinci_cfg_reg()
The function dm365evm_mmc_configure() references
the function __init davinci_cfg_reg().
This is often because dm365evm_mmc_configure lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of davinci_cfg_reg is wrong.

This removes the extraneous __init_or_module annotation.
