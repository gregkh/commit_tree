mm/mempolicy.c: merge alloc_hugepage_vma to alloc_pages_vma

The previous commit ("mm/thp: Allocate transparent hugepages on local
node") introduced alloc_hugepage_vma() to mm/mempolicy.c to perform a
special policy for THP allocations.  The function has the same interface
as alloc_pages_vma(), shares a lot of boilerplate code and a long
comment.

This patch merges the hugepage special case into alloc_pages_vma.  The
extra if condition should be cheap enough price to pay.  We also prevent
a (however unlikely) race with parallel mems_allowed update, which could
make hugepage allocation restart only within the fallback call to
alloc_hugepage_vma() and not reconsider the special rule in
alloc_hugepage_vma().

Also by making sure mpol_cond_put(pol) is always called before actual
allocation attempt, we can use a single exit path within the function.

Also update the comment for missing node parameter and obsolete reference
to mm_sem.
