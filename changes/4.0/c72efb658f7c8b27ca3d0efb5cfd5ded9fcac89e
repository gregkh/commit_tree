2f800fbd777b ("writeback: fix dirtied pages accounting on redirty")
introduced account_page_redirty() which reverts stat updates for a
redirtied page, making BDI_DIRTIED no longer monotonically increasing.

bdi_update_write_bandwidth() uses the delta in BDI_DIRTIED as the
basis for bandwidth calculation.  While unlikely, since the above
patch, the newer value may be lower than the recorded past value and
underflow the bandwidth calculation leading to a wild result.

Fix it by subtracing min of the old and new values when calculating
delta.  AFAIK, there hasn't been any report of it happening but the
resulting erratic behavior would be non-critical and temporary, so
it's possible that the issue is happening without being reported.  The
risk of the fix is very low, so tagged for -stable.
