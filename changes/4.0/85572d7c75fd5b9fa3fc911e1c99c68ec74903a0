md: rename mddev->write_lock to mddev->lock

This lock is used for (slightly) more than helping with writing
superblocks, and it will soon be extended further.  So the
name is inappropriate.

Also, the _irq variant hasn't been needed since 2.6.37 as it is
never taking from interrupt or bh context.

So:
  -rename write_lock to lock
  -document what it protects
  -remove _irq ... except in md_flush_request() as there
     is no wait_event_lock() (with no _irq).  This can be
     cleaned up after appropriate changes to wait.h.
