usb: renesas_usbhs: add OTG ID signal sensing

On the Renesas R8A7791 SoC based boards there's MAX3355 USB OTG chip and mini-AB
USB connector corresponding to USB port 0 driven either by EHCI/OHCI or  Renesas
USBHS gadget controller. And we'd like the host/gadget  drivers to work based on
the cable type connected. An 'extcon' driver for MAX3355 has been written, so we
only need to bind  to it via device tree which I'm doing in this patch.

(Perhaps, it would also make sense to use OTG HNP when the USBHS host mode is
active and a B-cable is connected but I don't have access to host-capable USBHS,
so  wouldn't be able to test it.)
