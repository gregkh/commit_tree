ktest: Place quotes around item variable

Seems that some of the new console logic causes doprint to possibly
get evaluated. When printing a commit message that contains parenthesis,
it fails with a shell parsing error.

This gets fixed when we add quotes around the $item variable, and prevent
it from being evaluated by any shell commands.
