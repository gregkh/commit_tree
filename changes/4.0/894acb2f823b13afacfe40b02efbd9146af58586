i2c: designware: Add Intel Baytrail PMIC I2C bus support

This patch implements an I2C bus sharing mechanism between the host and platform
hardware on select Intel BayTrail SoC platforms using the X-Powers AXP288 PMIC.

On these platforms access to the PMIC must be shared with platform hardware. The
hardware unit assumes full control of the I2C bus and the host must request
access through a special semaphore. Hardware control of the bus also makes it
necessary to disable runtime pm to avoid interfering with hardware transactions.
