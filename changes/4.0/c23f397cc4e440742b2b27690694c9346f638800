KVM: s390: reenable LPP facility

commit 7be81a46695d ("KVM: s390/facilities: allow TOD-CLOCK steering
facility bit") accidentially disabled the "load program parameter"
facility bit during rebase for upstream submission (my fault).

Re-add that bit.

As this is only for a performance measurement helper instruction
(used by KVM itself) cc stable is not necessary see

(SA23-2260 The Load-Program-Parameter and CPU-Measurement Facilities)
for details about LPP and its usecase.
