staging: comedi: adl_pci7x3x: rewrite comedi driver comment block

Rewrite the comedi "driver" comment block to conform to the usual format
for comedi driver comment blocks and reformat it to use the usual block
comment style.  In particular, the "Devices:" line should be a
comma-separated list where the first item is in the following format:

  [Manufacturer] BOARD-NAME (comedi-board-name)

The "[Manufacturer]" and/or "(comedi-board-name)" parts may be omitted
from following items, in which case the parts from the preceding item
are used.  The "Devices:" line may be continued continued over several
lines by using one or more spaces at the start of each continuation line
(not counting the space after the "*" in the block comment).

The original comment indicated the number of input and output channels
in each item on the "Devices:" line.  Move this information into a
separate paragraph moved from a block comment found elsewhere in the
driver.
