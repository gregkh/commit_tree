staging: comedi: das1800: tidy up das1800_ai_transfer_size()

For aesthetics, pass the fill time 'ns' as a parameter to this function.

Refactor this function to calculate the transfer size in 'samples' instead
of 'bytes'. This removes the need to constantly multiply the values by the
'sample_size'. It also helps avoid any possible integer overflow issues.

Use the comedi_nsamples_left() helper to limit the samples when cmd->stop_src
is TRIG_COUNT.

Use comedi_samples_to_bytes() to return the final DMA size in bytes.
