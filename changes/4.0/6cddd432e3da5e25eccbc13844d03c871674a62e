KVM: s390: handle stop irqs without action_bits

This patch removes the famous action_bits and moves the handling of
SIGP STOP AND STORE STATUS directly into the SIGP STOP interrupt.

The new local interrupt infrastructure is used to track pending stop
requests.

STOP irqs are the only irqs that don't get actively delivered. They
remain pending until the stop function is executed (=stop intercept).

If another STOP irq is already pending, -EBUSY will now be returned
(needed for the SIGP handling code).

Migration of pending SIGP STOP (AND STORE STATUS) orders should now
be supported out of the box.
