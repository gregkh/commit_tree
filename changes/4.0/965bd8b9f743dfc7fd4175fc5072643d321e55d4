drivers: staging: lustre: Use mult if units not specified

Units can be passed to lprocfs_write_frac_u64_helper() via a suffix
(e.g., "...K", "...M", etc.) tacked onto the value.  A comment states
that "specified units override the multiplier," though the multiplier is
overridden regardless.  Update the conditional logic so that it only
applies when units are specified.
