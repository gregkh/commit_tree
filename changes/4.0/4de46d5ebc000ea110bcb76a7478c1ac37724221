netlabel: Less function calls in netlbl_mgmt_add_common() after error detection

The functions "cipso_v4_doi_putdef" and "kfree" could be called in some cases
by the netlbl_mgmt_add_common() function during error handling even if the
passed variables contained still a null pointer.

* This implementation detail could be improved by adjustments for jump labels.

* Let us return immediately after the first failed function call according to
  the current Linux coding style convention.

* Let us delete also an unnecessary check for the variable "entry" there.
