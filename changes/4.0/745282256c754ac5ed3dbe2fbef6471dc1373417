xen/gntdev: safely unmap grants in case they are still in use

Use gnttab_unmap_refs_async() to wait until the mapped pages are no
longer in use before unmapping them.

This allows userspace programs to safely use Direct I/O and AIO to a
network filesystem which may retain refs to pages in queued skbs after
the filesystem I/O has completed.
