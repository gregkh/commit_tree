netlink: make the check for "send from tx_ring" deterministic

As it is, zero msg_iovlen means that the first iovec in the kernel
array of iovecs is left uninitialized, so checking if its ->iov_base
is NULL is random.  Since the real users of that thing are doing
sendto(fd, NULL, 0, ...), they are getting msg_iovlen = 1 and
msg_iov[0] = {NULL, 0}, which is what this test is trying to catch.
As suggested by davem, let's just check that msg_iovlen was 1 and
msg_iov[0].iov_base was NULL - _that_ is well-defined and it catches
what we want to catch.
