slab: embed memcg_cache_params to kmem_cache

Currently, kmem_cache stores a pointer to struct memcg_cache_params
instead of embedding it.  The rationale is to save memory when kmem
accounting is disabled.  However, the memcg_cache_params has shrivelled
drastically since it was first introduced:

* Initially:

struct memcg_cache_params {
	bool is_root_cache;
	union {
		struct kmem_cache *memcg_caches[0];
		struct {
			struct mem_cgroup *memcg;
			struct list_head list;
			struct kmem_cache *root_cache;
			bool dead;
			atomic_t nr_pages;
			struct work_struct destroy;
		};
	};
};

* Now:

struct memcg_cache_params {
	bool is_root_cache;
	union {
		struct {
			struct rcu_head rcu_head;
			struct kmem_cache *memcg_caches[0];
		};
		struct {
			struct mem_cgroup *memcg;
			struct kmem_cache *root_cache;
		};
	};
};

So the memory saving does not seem to be a clear win anymore.

OTOH, keeping a pointer to memcg_cache_params struct instead of embedding
it results in touching one more cache line on kmem alloc/free hot paths.
Besides, it makes linking kmem caches in a list chained by a field of
struct memcg_cache_params really painful due to a level of indirection,
while I want to make them linked in the following patch.  That said, let
us embed it.
