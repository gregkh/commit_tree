irda: vlsi_ir: Replace timeval with ktime_t

The vlsi ir driver uses 'timeval', which we try to remove in the kernel
because all 32-bit time types will break in the year 2038.

This patch also changes do_gettimeofday() to ktime_get() accordingly,
since ktime_get returns a ktime_t, but do_gettimeofday returns a
struct timeval, and the other reason is that ktime_get() uses
the monotonic clock.

This patch uses ktime_us_delta to get the elapsed time of microsecond,
and uses div_s64_rem to get what seconds & microseconds time elapsed
for printing.

This patch also changes the function 'vlsi_hard_start_xmit' to do the
same things as the others drivers, that is passing the remaining time
into udelay() instead of looping until enough time has passed.
