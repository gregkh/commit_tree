Btrfs: add sanity test for outstanding_extents accounting

I introduced a regression wrt outstanding_extents accounting.  These are tricky
areas that aren't easily covered by xfstests as we could change MAX_EXTENT_SIZE
at any time.  So add sanity tests to cover the various conditions that are
tricky in order to make sure we don't introduce regressions in the future.
Thanks,
