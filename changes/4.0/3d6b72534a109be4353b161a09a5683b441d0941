bnx2x: Fix kdump on 4-port device

When running in a kdump kernel, it's very likely that due to sync. loss with
management firmware the first PCI function to probe and reach the previous
unload flow would decide it can reset the chip and continue onward. While doing
so, it will only close its own Rx port.

On a 4-port device where 2nd port on engine is a 1g-port, the 2nd port would
allow ingress traffic after the chip is reset [assuming it was active on the
first kernel]. This would later cause a HW attention.

This changes driver flow to close both ports' 1g capabilities during the
previous driver unload flow prior to the chip reset.
