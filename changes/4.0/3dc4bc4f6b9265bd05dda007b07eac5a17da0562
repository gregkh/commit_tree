KVM: x86: JMP/CALL using call- or task-gate causes exception

The KVM emulator does not emulate JMP and CALL that target a call gate or a
task gate.  This patch does not try to implement these scenario as they are
presumably rare; yet it returns X86EMUL_UNHANDLEABLE error in such cases
instead of generating an exception.
