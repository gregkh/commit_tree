xen-netback: unref frags when handling a from-guest skb with a frag list

Every time a VIF is destroyed up to 256 pages may be leaked if packets
with more than MAX_SKB_FRAGS frags were transmitted from the guest.
Even worse, if another user of ballooned pages allocated one of these
ballooned pages it would not handle the unexpectedly >1 page count
(e.g., gntdev would deadlock when unmapping a grant because the page
count would never reach 1).

When handling a from-guest skb with a frag list, unref the frags
before releasing them so they are freed correctly when the VIF is
destroyed.
