kgdb, docs: Fix <para> pdfdocs build errors

kgdb.pdf failed to build from 'make pdfdocs' giving errors such as:

jade:... Documentation/DocBook/kgdb.xml:200:8:E:
document type does not allow element "para" here; missing one of
"footnote", "caution", "important", "note", "tip", "warning",
"blockquote", "informalexample" start-tag

Fixing minor <para> and <sect> issues allows kgdb.pdf to be generated
under Fedora20.
