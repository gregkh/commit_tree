iwlwifi: dvm: run INIT firmware again upon .start()

The assumption before this patch was that we don't need to
run again the INIT firmware after the system booted. The
INIT firmware runs calibrations which impact the physical
layer's behavior.
Users reported that it may be helpful to run these
calibrations again every time the interface is brought up.
The penatly is minimal, since the calibrations run fast.
