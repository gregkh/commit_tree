USB: ch341: set tty baud speed according to tty struct

The ch341_set_baudrate() function initialize the device baud speed
according to the value on priv->baud_rate. By default the ch341_open() set
it to a hardcoded value (DEFAULT_BAUD_RATE 9600). Unfortunately, the
tty_struct is not initialized with the same default value. (usually 56700)

This means that the tty_struct and the device baud rate generator are not
synchronized after opening the port.

Fixup is done by calling ch341_set_termios() if tty exist.
Remove unnecessary variable priv->baud_rate setup as it's already done by
ch341_port_probe().
Remove unnecessary call to ch341_set_{handshake,baudrate}() in
ch341_open() as there already called in ch341_configure() and
ch341_set_termios()
