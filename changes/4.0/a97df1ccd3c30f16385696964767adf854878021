drm/atomic: Hide drm.ko internal interfaces

This is just a bit fallout from patch polishing and moving the
get_prop logic fully into the core:
- Drop EXPORT_SYMBOL and make the helpers static.
- Drop kerneldoc since not used by drivers.
- Move the cross-file function declarations only used by drm.ko
  internally to an internal header.

v2: keep the gist of the comments, requested by Rob.
