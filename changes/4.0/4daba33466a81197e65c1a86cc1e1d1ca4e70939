tty: serial: msm_serial: code cleanup in msm_console_setup

The change does following:
 - baud, flow, bits, parity were being overwritten as they were
   being reinitialized after parsing.  Initialize them when they are
   declared so that user provided setting are not overwritten.
 - msm_set_baud_rate() is anyway called in uart_set_options when it calls
   msm_set_termios(). msm_reset() is called when we change the baud rate.
   Hence doing away with both of these calls.
 - CR_CMD_PROTECTION_EN and CR_TX_ENABLE settings are done in msm_set_baud_rate.
   So do away with this here.
