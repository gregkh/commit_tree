ovl: Fix opaque regression in ovl_lookup

Current multi-layer support overlayfs has a regression in
.lookup(). If there is a directory in upperdir and a regular
file has same name in lowerdir in a merged directory, lower
file is hidden and upper directory is set to opaque in former
case. But it is changed in present code.

In lowerdir lookup path, if a found inode is not directory,
the type checking of previous inode is missing. This inode
will be copied to the lowerstack of ovl_entry directly.

That will lead to several wrong conditions, for example,
the reading of the directory in upperdir may return an error
like:

   ls: reading directory .: Not a directory

This patch makes the lowerdir lookup path check the opaque
for non-directory file too.
