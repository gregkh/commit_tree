PM / Domains: Eliminate the mutex for the generic_pm_domain_data

While adding devices to their PM domains, dev_pm_qos_add_notifier() was
invoked while allocating the generic_pm_domain_data for the device.

Since the generic_pm_domain_data's device pointer will be assigned
after allocation, the ->genpd_dev_pm_qos_notifier() callback could be
called prior having a valid pointer to the device. Similar scenario
existed while removing a device from a genpd.

To cope with these scenarios a mutex was used to protect the pointer to
the device.

By re-order the sequence for when dev_pm_qos_add|remove_notifier() are
invoked, we make sure the ->genpd_dev_pm_qos_notifier() callback are
always called with a valid device pointer available.

In this way, we eliminate the need for protecting the pointer and thus
we can remove the mutex from the struct generic_pm_domain_data.
