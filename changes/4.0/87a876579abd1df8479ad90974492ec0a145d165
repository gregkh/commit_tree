drm/nouveau/msppp: namespace + nvidia gpu names (no binary change)

The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).

Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
naming to ease collaboration with them.

A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.
