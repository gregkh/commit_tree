[media] Revert "[media] v4l: omap4iss: Add module debug parameter"

This reverts commit 186612342500b0af8498d7c8bc6b3ac32ac7a48e.

The video_device debug field has been renamed to dev_debug, resulting in
a compilation failure. As v4l2 debugging is supposed to be controlled
through a sysfs attribute created by the v4l2 core, there's no need to
duplicate debug control through a module parameter. Remove it.
