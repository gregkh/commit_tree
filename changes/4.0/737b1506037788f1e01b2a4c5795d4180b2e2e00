drm/i915: Convert hangcheck from a timer into a delayed work item

When run as a timer, i915_hangcheck_elapsed() must adhere to all the
rules of running in a softirq context. This is advantageous to us as we
want to minimise the risk that a driver bug will prevent us from
detecting a hung GPU. However, that is irrelevant if the driver bug
prevents us from resetting and recovering. Still it is prudent not to
rely on mutexes inside the checker, but given the coarseness of
dev->struct_mutex doing so is extremely hard.

Give in and run from a work queue, i.e. outside of softirq.

v2: Use own workqueue to avoid deadlocks (Daniel)
