mmc: sdhci: switch voltage before sdhci_set_ios in runtime resume

I observed the Host Control2 register isn't correctly restored
after runtime resuming on BG2Q. For example, the register reads
as 0x800c before runtime suspend, but it's set as 0x8004 after runtime
resuming. This could results in a non working host.

The reason is the Host Control2 is incorrectly reset when switching
voltage. We fix this by following the same sequence during initialization.
