rcu: Fix RCU CPU stall detection in tiny implementation

The tiny RCU CPU stall detection depends on *rcp->curtail not being
NULL. It is however a tail pointer and thus NULL by definition. Instead we
should check rcp->rcucblist for the presence of pending callbacks which
need to be processed. With this fix INFO about the stall is printed and
jiffies_stall (jiffies at next stall) correctly updated.

Note that the check for pending callback is necessary to avoid spurious
warnings if there are no pendings callbacks.
