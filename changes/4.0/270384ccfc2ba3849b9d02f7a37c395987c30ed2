ALSA: atmel: fix building the ac97 driver for at91-multiplatform

at91 will no longer export the mach/cpu.h and mach/hardware.h header files
in the future, which would break building the atmel ac97c driver.

Since the cpu_is_* check is only used to find out whether we are running
on avr32 or arm/at91, we can hardcode that check in the ARM case.
