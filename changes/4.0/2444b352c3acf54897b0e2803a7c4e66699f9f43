KVM: s390: forward most SIGP orders to user space

Most SIGP orders are handled partially in kernel and partially in
user space. In order to:
- Get a correct SIGP SET PREFIX handler that informs user space
- Avoid race conditions between concurrently executed SIGP orders
- Serialize SIGP orders per VCPU

We need to handle all "slow" SIGP orders in user space. The remaining
ones to be handled completely in kernel are:
- SENSE
- SENSE RUNNING
- EXTERNAL CALL
- EMERGENCY SIGNAL
- CONDITIONAL EMERGENCY SIGNAL
According to the PoP, they have to be fast. They can be executed
without conflicting to the actions of other pending/concurrently
executing orders (e.g. STOP vs. START).

This patch introduces a new capability that will - when enabled -
forward all but the mentioned SIGP orders to user space. The
instruction counters in the kernel are still updated.
