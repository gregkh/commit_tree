tracing: Remove taking of trace_types_lock in pipe files

Taking the global mutex "trace_types_lock" in the trace_pipe files
causes a bottle neck as most the pipe files can be read per cpu
and there's no reason to serialize them.

The current_trace variable was given a ref count and it can not
change when the ref count is not zero. Opening the trace_pipe
files will up the ref count (and decremented on close), so that
the lock no longer needs to be taken when accessing the
current_trace variable.
