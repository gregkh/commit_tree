pinctrl: pinconf-generic: loose DT dependence

New pin controllers such as ACPI-based may also have custom properties
to parse, and should be able to use generic pin config. Let's make the
code compile on !OF systems and rename members a bit to underscore it
is custom parameters and not necessarily DT parameters.

This fixes a build regression for x86_64 on the zeroday kernel builds.
