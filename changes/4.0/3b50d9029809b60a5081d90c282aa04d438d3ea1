ipv6: fix redefinition of in6_pktinfo and ip6_mtuinfo

Both netinet/in.h and linux/ipv6.h define these two structs,
if we include both of them, we got:

	/usr/include/linux/ipv6.h:19:8: error: redefinition of ‘struct in6_pktinfo’
	 struct in6_pktinfo {
		^
	In file included from /usr/include/arpa/inet.h:22:0,
			 from txtimestamp.c:33:
	/usr/include/netinet/in.h:524:8: note: originally defined here
	 struct in6_pktinfo
		^
	In file included from txtimestamp.c:40:0:
	/usr/include/linux/ipv6.h:24:8: error: redefinition of ‘struct ip6_mtuinfo’
	 struct ip6_mtuinfo {
		^
	In file included from /usr/include/arpa/inet.h:22:0,
			 from txtimestamp.c:33:
	/usr/include/netinet/in.h:531:8: note: originally defined here
	 struct ip6_mtuinfo
		^
So similarly to what we did for in6_addr, we need to sync with
libc header on their definitions.
