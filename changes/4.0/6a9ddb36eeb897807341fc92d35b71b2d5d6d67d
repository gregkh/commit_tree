i40e: disable IOV before freeing resources

If VF drivers are loaded in the host OS, the call to pci_disable_sriov()
will cause these drivers' remove routines to be called. If the PF driver
has already freed VF resources before this happens, then the VF remove
routine can't properly communicate with the PF driver causing all sorts
of mayhem and error messages and hurt feelings.

To fix this, we move the call to pci_disable_sriov() up to the top of
the function and let it complete before freeing any VF resources.
