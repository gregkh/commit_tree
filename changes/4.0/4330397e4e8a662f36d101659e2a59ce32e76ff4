ovl: discard independent cursor in readdir()

Since the ovl_dir_cache is stable during a directory reading, the cursor
of struct ovl_dir_file don't need to be an independent entry in the list
of a merged directory.

This patch changes *cursor* to a pointer which points to the entry in the
ovl_dir_cache. After this, we don't need to check *is_cursor* either.
