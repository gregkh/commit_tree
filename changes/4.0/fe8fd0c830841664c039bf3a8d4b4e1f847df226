staging: comedi: ni_65xx: use board names on "Devices:" line

All the supported devices listed on the "Devices:" line currently use
the comedi driver name as the comedi board name.  Historically, this
documented the name that should be passed to the "comedi_config" program
to "attach" the device via the COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl.  Some drivers
expected the driver name and others expected the board name.  Since this
driver no longer supports the legacy "attach" mechanism, change the
"Devices:" list to show the board names, as that is probably more
useful.
