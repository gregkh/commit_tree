PCI: Don't look for ACPI hotplug parameters if ACPI is disabled

Booting a v3.18 or newer Xen domU kernel with PCI devices passed through
results in an oops (this is a 32-bit 3.13.11 dom0 with a 64-bit 4.4.0
hypervisor and 32-bit domU):

Don't look for ACPI configuration information if ACPI has been disabled.

I don't think this is the best fix, because we can boot plain Linux (no
Xen) with "acpi=off", and we don't need this check in pci_get_hp_params().
There should be a better fix that would make Xen domU work the same way.
The domU kernel has ACPI support but it has no AML.  There should be a way
to initialize the ACPI data structures so things fail gracefully rather
than oopsing.  This is an interim fix to address the regression.
