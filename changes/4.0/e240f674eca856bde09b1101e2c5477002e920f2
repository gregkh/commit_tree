i40e: fix proc/int descriptions

This patch fixes a problem where the /proc/interrupts descriptions
from the msix configuration were truncating the needed bus info,
making it hard to distinguish configuration from port to port.
This patch increases the string buffer size in order to allow the
full data to be displayed and sync's the text formatting of the misc
and fdir interrupt names
