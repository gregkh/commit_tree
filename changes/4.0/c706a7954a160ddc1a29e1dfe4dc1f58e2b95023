hpsa: detect and report failures changing controller transport modes

Detect failues when attempting to change controller to use simple
or performant transport modes (mode change ack) rather than just
proceeding ahead after timeouts.

Return values are added to:
	hpsa_put_ctlr_into_performant_mode
	hpsa_wait_for_mode_change_ack
and all their callers check/propagate the result.

More consistency in printing errors and whether
dev_err is used.
