mm: make FIRST_USER_ADDRESS unsigned long on all archs

LKP has triggered a compiler warning after my recent patch "mm: account
pmd page tables to the process":

    mm/mmap.c: In function 'exit_mmap':
 >> mm/mmap.c:2857:2: warning: right shift count >= width of type [enabled by default]

The code:

 > 2857                WARN_ON(mm_nr_pmds(mm) >
   2858                                round_up(FIRST_USER_ADDRESS, PUD_SIZE) >> PUD_SHIFT);

In this, on tile, we have FIRST_USER_ADDRESS defined as 0.  round_up() has
the same type -- int.  PUD_SHIFT.

I think the best way to fix it is to define FIRST_USER_ADDRESS as unsigned
long.  On every arch for consistency.
