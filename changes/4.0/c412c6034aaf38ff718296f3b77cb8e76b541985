drivers/rtc/rtc-rk808.c: fix rtc time reading issue

After we set the GET_TIME bit, the rtc time can't be read immediately.  We
should wait up to 31.25 us, about one cycle of 32khz.  Otherwise reading
RTC time will return a old time.  If we clear the GET_TIME bit after
setting, the time of i2c transfer is certainly more than 31.25us.

Doug said:

: I think we are safe.  At 400kHz (the max speed of this part) each bit can
: be transferred no faster than 2.5us.  In order to do a valid i2c
: transaction we need to _at least_ write the address of the device and the
: data onto the bus, which is 16 bits.  16 * 2.5us = 40us.  That's above the
: 31.25us
