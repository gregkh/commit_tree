ocfs2: fix journal commit deadlock in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents

Similar to ocfs2_write_end_nolock() which is metioned at commit
136f49b91710 ("ocfs2: fix journal commit deadlock"), we should unlock
pages before ocfs2_commit_trans() in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents.

Otherwise, it will cause a deadlock with journal commit threads.
