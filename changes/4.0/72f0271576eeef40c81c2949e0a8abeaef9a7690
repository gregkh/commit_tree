of: i2c: Add i2c-mux-idle-disconnect DT property to PCA954x mux driver

Add i2c-mux-idle-disconnect device tree property to PCA954x mux driver. The new
property forces the multiplexer to disconnect child buses in idle state. This is
used, for example, when there are several multiplexers on the same bus and the
devices on the underlying buses might have same I2C addresses.
