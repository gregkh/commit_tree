PCI: versatile: Add DT-based ARM Versatile PB PCIe host driver

This converts the Versatile PCI host code to a platform driver using the
commom DT parsing and setup.  The driver uses only an empty ARM
pci_sys_data struct and does not use pci_common_init_dev init function.
The old host code will be removed in a subsequent commit when Versatile is
completely converted to DT.

I've tested this on QEMU with the sym53c8xx driver in both i/o and memory
mapped modes.
