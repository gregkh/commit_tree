spi: atmel: cleanup wait_for_completion return handling

return type of wait_for_completion_timeout is unsigned long not int, this
patch adds an appropriate variable and fixes up the assignment. It removes
the else branch as the only thing it was doing is assigning ret = 0; - but
ret is never used thereafter so that is not needed. As the string in
dev_err already states "timeout" there is little point in printing the 0.
A typo in "trasfer" -> transfer is also fixed.
