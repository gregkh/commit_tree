dmaengine: split out pause/resume operations from device_control

Split out the pause and resume operations to callbacks of their own. In order
to preserve some backwark compatibility, the dmaengine_pause/dmaengine_resume
are still falling back on dmaengine_device_control.

Eventually, that will allow to get the device capabilities in a generic way,
removing the need to implement device_slave_caps.
