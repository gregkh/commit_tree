perf tools: Fix probing for PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC flag

Commit f6edb53c4993ffe92ce521fb449d1c146cea6ec2 converted the probe to
a CPU wide event first (pid == -1). For kernels that do not support
the PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC flag the probe fails with EINVAL. Since this
errno is not handled pid is not reset to 0 and the subsequent use of
pid = -1 as an argument brings in an additional failure path if
perf_event_paranoid > 0:

$ perf record -- sleep 1
perf_event_open(..., 0) failed unexpectedly with error 13 (Permission denied)
[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.007 MB /tmp/perf.data (11 samples) ]

Also, ensure the fd of the confirmation check is closed and comment why
pid = -1 is used.

Needs to go to 3.18 stable tree as well.
