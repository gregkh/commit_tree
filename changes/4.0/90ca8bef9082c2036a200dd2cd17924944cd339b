[media] btcx-risc: move to bt8xx

The btcx-risc module is no longer used by other drivers except for bttv.
So move it from common to bt8xx and make it part of the bttv driver instead
of as a separate module.

This module should never have been a common module since most of the code
has always been bttv specific.
