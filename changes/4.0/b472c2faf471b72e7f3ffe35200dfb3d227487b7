PM / Domains: Handle errors from genpd's ->attach_dev() callback

The optional genpd's ->attach_dev() callback is invoked from
__pm_genpd_add_device(). Let's add error handling from the response
from this callback and propagate the error code.

When __pm_genpd_add_device() is invoked through the generic OF-based PM
domain look-up path, the device is being probed. Returning an error
will mean the device won't be attached to its PM domain. Errors of
-EPROBE_DEFER get special treatment and is propagated to the driver
core.

Therefore this change also enables the ->attach_dev() callback to
be able to request for a deferred probe sequence.
