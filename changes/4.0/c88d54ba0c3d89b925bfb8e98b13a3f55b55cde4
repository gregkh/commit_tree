CNS3xxx: Remove artificial dependency on pci_sys_data domain.

On cns3xxx platforms the PCI controller probing code relies on an
artificial dependency on the domain number to look-up the internal data
structures.

This patch reworks the host controller control data structure and adds a
domain equivalent field named port in it so that the dependency on
pci_sys_data domain field can be eventually removed.
