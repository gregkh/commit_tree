pm: at91: Workaround DDRSDRC self-refresh bug with LPDDR1 memories.

The DDRSDR controller fails miserably to put LPDDR1 memories in
self-refresh. Force the controller to think it has DDR2 memories
during the self-refresh period, as the DDR2 self-refresh spec is
equivalent to LPDDR1, and is correctly implemented in the
controller.

Assume that the second controller has the same fault, but that is
untested.
