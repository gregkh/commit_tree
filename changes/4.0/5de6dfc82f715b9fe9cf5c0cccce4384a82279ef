ath10k: Fix potential Rx ring corruption

When replenishing Rx buffers driver updates the address of the
buffer and the index of rx buffer in rx ring to the firmware.
Change in order by CPU can cause rx ring corruption. Add memory
barrier before updating rx buffer index to guarantee the order.

This could fix some instances of rx ring corruption due to done
bit in rx attention flag not set.
