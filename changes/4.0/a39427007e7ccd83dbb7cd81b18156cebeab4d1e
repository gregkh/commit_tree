xfs: Remove some pointless quota checks

xfs_fs_get_xstate() and xfs_fs_get_xstatev() check whether there's quota
running before calling xfs_qm_scall_getqstat() or
xfs_qm_scall_getqstatv(). Thus we are certain that superblock supports
quota and xfs_sb_version_hasquota() check is pointless. Similarly we
know that when quota is running, mp->m_quotainfo will be allocated.
