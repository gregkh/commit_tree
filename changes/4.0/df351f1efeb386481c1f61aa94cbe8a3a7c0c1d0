soc: ti: knav_qmss_queue: makefile tweak to build as dynamic module

Currently configuring qmss and dma as dynamic module creates three .ko
files. knav_qmss_acc.ko and knav_qmss_queue.ko both can't be insmod
because of circular dependency. So combine these two into one module
by changing the makefile.
