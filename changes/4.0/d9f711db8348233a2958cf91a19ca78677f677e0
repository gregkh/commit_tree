builddeb: Try to determine distribution

lsb_release command is a good choice to determine the distribution
name for the changelog file in the generated Debian packages [1].
Its installation is no precondition.
In Debian it is still not essential or build-essential.

Ben gave some helpful informations and detailed explanations in [2].
There he also suggested to have an option to explicitly set the
distribution name (see $KDEB_CHANGELOG_DIST variable).

Embedded the improvement as suggested by Thorsten (see [3]):

"This is suboptimal: if KDEB_CHANGELOG_DIST is defined,
lsb_release is not necessary. The following snippet
also omits using its output if it fails but still
produces any:"

Dealing with this issue I learned about "The Colon in the Shell." and
possible pitfalls in this area (see [4,5]). Furthermore, refreshed my
knowledge about redirecting outputs with the echo command (see [5]).
Special thanks to Thorsten, I enjoyed the IRC session with you.

Cooked together the snippets of Ben and Thorsten (see [2,3]).
Tested against Linux v3.19-rc2.

Thanks goes to Alexander, Ben, maximilian and Thorsten for the very
vital help.
