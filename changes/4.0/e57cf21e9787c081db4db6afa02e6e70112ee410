Btrfs: fix allocation size calculations in alloc_btrfs_bio

Since commit 8e5cfb55d3f (Btrfs: Make raid_map array be inlined in
btrfs_bio structure), the raid map array is allocated along with the
btrfs bio in alloc_btrfs_bio.  The calculation used to decide how much
we need to allocate was using the wrong parameter passed into the
allocation function.

The passed in real_stripes will be zero if a target replace operation
is not currently running.  We want to use total_stripes instead.
