checkpatch: emit an error when using predefined timestamp macros

Since commit fe7c36c7bde1 ("Makefile: Build with -Werror=date-time if
the compiler supports it"), use of __DATE__, __TIME__, and __TIMESTAMP__
has not been allowed.

As this test is gcc version specific (> 4.9), it hasn't prevented a few
new uses from creeping into the kernel sources.

Make checkpatch complain about them.
