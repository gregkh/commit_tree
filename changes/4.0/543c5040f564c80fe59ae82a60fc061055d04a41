ARM: make arrays containing machine compatible strings const

The definition

	static const char *axxia_dt_match[] __initconst = {
		...

defines a changable array of constant strings. That is you must not do:

	*axxia_dt_match[0] = 'k';

but

	axxia_dt_match[0] = "different string";

is fine. So the annotation __initconst is wrong and yields a compiler
error when other really const variables are added with __initconst.

As the struct machine_desc member dt_compat is declared as

	const char *const *dt_compat;

making the arrays const is the better alternative over changing all
annotations to __initdata.
