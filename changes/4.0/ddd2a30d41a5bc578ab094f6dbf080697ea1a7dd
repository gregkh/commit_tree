drivers/rtc/rtc-mrst: fix suspend/resume

The Moorestown RTC driver implements suspend and resume callbacks and
assigns them to the suspend and resume fields of the device_driver
struct.  These callbacks are never actually called by anything though.

Modify the driver to properly use dev_pm_ops so that the suspend and
resume functions are actually executed upon suspend/resume.
