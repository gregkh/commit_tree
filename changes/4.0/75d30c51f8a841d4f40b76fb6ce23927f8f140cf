spi: pl08x: do not select S3C64XX_PL080

The pl08x driver originally selected S3C64XX_PL080 to avoid having
the legacy Samsung DMA interfaces. Those are now gone, so the
select is no longer needed, but it now causes problems when
CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE is disabled:

arch/arm/plat-samsung/built-in.o: In function `s3c64xx_spi0_set_platdata':
:(.init.text+0x518): undefined reference to `pl08x_filter_id'

This simply removes the 'select' to avoid this problem.
