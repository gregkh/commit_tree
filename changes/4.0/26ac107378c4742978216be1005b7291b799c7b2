md/raid5: Fix livelock when array is both resyncing and degraded.

Commit a7854487cd7128a30a7f4f5259de9f67d5efb95f:
  md: When RAID5 is dirty, force reconstruct-write instead of read-modify-write.

Causes an RCW cycle to be forced even when the array is degraded.
A degraded array cannot support RCW as that requires reading all data
blocks, and one may be missing.

Forcing an RCW when it is not possible causes a live-lock and the code
spins, repeatedly deciding to do something that cannot succeed.

So change the condition to only force RCW on non-degraded arrays.
