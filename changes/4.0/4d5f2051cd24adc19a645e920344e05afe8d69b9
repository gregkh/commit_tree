tpm, tpm_tis: fix TPM 2.0 probing

If during transmission system error was returned, the logic was to
incorrectly deduce that chip is a TPM 1.x chip. This patch fixes this
issue. Also, this patch changes probing so that message tag is used as the
measure for TPM 2.x, which should be much more stable. A separate function
called tpm2_probe() is encapsulated because it can be used with any
chipset.
