net/mlx4_core: Enhance the catas flow to support device reset

This includes:

- resetting the chip when a fatal error is detected (the current code
  does not do this).

- exposing the ability to enter error state from outside the catas code
  by calling its functionality. (E.g. FW Command timeout, AER error).

- managing a persistent device state. This is needed to sync between
  reset flow cases.
