Revert "x86/apic: Only disable CPU x2apic mode when necessary"

This reverts commit 5fcee53ce705d49c766f8a302c7e93bdfc33c124.

It causes the suspend to fail on at least the Chromebook Pixel, possibly
other platforms too.

Joerg Roedel points out that the logic should probably have been

                if (max_physical_apicid > 255 ||
                    !(IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST) &&
                      hypervisor_x2apic_available())) {

instead, but since the code is not in any fast-path, so we can just live
without that optimization and just revert to the original code.
