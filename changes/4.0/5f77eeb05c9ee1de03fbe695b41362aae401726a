drm/i915: Use BUILD_BUG if possible in the i915 WARN_ON

Faster feedback to errors is always better. This is inspired by the
addition to WARN_ONs to mask/enable helpers for registers to make sure
callers have the arguments ordered correctly: Pretty much always the
arguments are static.

We use WARN_ON(1) a lot in default switch statements though where we
should always handle all cases. So add a new macro specifically for
that.

The idea to use __builtin_constant_p is from Chris Wilson.

v2: Use the ({}) gcc-ism to avoid the static inline, suggested by
Dave. My first attempt used __cond as the temp var, which is the same
used by BUILD_BUG_ON, but with inverted sense. Hilarity ensued, so
sprinkle i915 into the name.

Also use a temporary variable to only evaluate the condition once,
suggested by Damien.

v3: It's crazy but apparently 32bit gcc can't compile out the
BUILD_BUG_ON in a lot of cases and just falls over. I have no idea
why, but until clue grows just disable this nifty idea on 32bit
builds. Reported by 0-day builder.

v4: Got it all wrong, apparently its the gcc version. We need 4.9+.
Now reported by Imre.

v5: Chris suggested to add the case to MISSING_CASE for speedier
debug.

v6: Even some gcc 4.9 versions don't see through the maze, so give up
for now. Keep the skeleton and MISSING_CASE stuff though.
