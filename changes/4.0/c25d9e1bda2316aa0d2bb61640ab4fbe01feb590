mmc: sdhci-pxav3: Remove checks for optional core clock in error/remove path

Commit 63589e92c2d9 ("clk: Ignore error and NULL pointers passed to
clk_{unprepare, disable}()") allows NULL or error pointer to be passed
unconditionally.

This patch is to simplify probe error and remove code paths.

However, we reserve the core clock checks in runtime suspend/resume code
because we want a little smaller latency.
