drm/tegra: output: Make ->setup_clock() optional

In order to transition output drivers to using the struct tegra_output
as a helper rather than midlayer, make this callback optional. Instead
drivers should implement the equivalent as part of ->mode_fixup(). For
the conversion to atomic modesetting a new callback ->atomic_check()
should be implemented that updates the display controller's state with
the corresponding parent clock, rate and shift clock divider.
