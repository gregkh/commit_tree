scripts/gdb: add container_of helper and convenience function

Provide an internal helper with container_of semantics.  As type lookups
are very slow in gdb-python and we need a type "long" for this, cache the
reference to this type object.  Then export the helper also as a
convenience function form use at the gdb command line.
