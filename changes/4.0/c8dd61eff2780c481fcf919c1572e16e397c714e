megaraid_sas: complete outstanding IOCTLs before killing adapter

Driver calls megasas_complete_cmd() to call wake_up() for each MFI frame
that was issued through the ioctl() interface prior to the kill adapter.
This ensures userspace ioctl() system calls issued just before a kill
adapter don't get stuck in wait state and IOCTLs are returned to
the application.
