fib_trie: Use unsigned long for anything dealing with a shift by bits

This change makes it so that anything that can be shifted by, or compared
to a value shifted by bits is updated to be an unsigned long.  This is
mostly a precaution against an insanely huge address space that somehow
starts coming close to the 2^32 root node size which would require
something like 1.5 billion addresses.

I chose unsigned long instead of unsigned long long since I do not believe
it is possible to allocate a 32 bit tnode on a 32 bit system as the memory
consumed would be 16GB + 28B which exceeds the addressible space for any
one process.
