sched/deadline: Fix stale yield state

When we fail to start the deadline timer in update_curr_dl(), we
forget to clear ->dl_yielded, resulting in wrecked time keeping.

Since the natural place to clear both ->dl_yielded and ->dl_throttled
is in replenish_dl_entity(); both are after all waiting for that event;
make it so.

Luckily since 67dfa1b756f2 ("sched/deadline: Implement
cancel_dl_timer() to use in switched_from_dl()") the
task_on_rq_queued() condition in dl_task_timer() must be true, and can
therefore call enqueue_task_dl() unconditionally.
